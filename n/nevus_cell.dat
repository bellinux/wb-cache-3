40|$|Abstract. The {{current study}} {{presents}} a rare case of intra-dermal melanocytic nevus with lymphatic <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> embolus. A 26 -year-old male {{presented with a}} slowly enlarging, pigmented nodule on the back, measuring 1 cm in diameter. Histological observations of the lesion were typical of an intradermal melanocytic nevus. The most notable feature of this nevus, however, was an aggregate of nevus cells within a lymphatic vessel of the upper dermis. The nevus cells observed within the lymphatic lumen demonstrated character-istic morphological features of type A nevus cells. The cells were round-to-cuboidal, exhibited abundant cytoplasm with well‑defined cell borders and formed nests. In addition, the <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> aggregate was lined by flattened endothelial cells. <b>Nevus</b> <b>cell</b> aggregates occur in the collagenous framework of lymph nodes, however, the mechanism by which nevus cells are deposited in lymph nodes {{has been a source}} of interest and controversy. The histological observation presented may be regarded as support for the mechanical transport or benign metastasis theories, which posit transfer of <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> emboli, via lymphatics, from a cutaneous nevus to the draining regional lymph node. Due to its rarity, a lymphatic <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> embolus creates diagnostic and management issues for pathologists and clinicians. This observation must not be interpreted as evidence of malignancy, but must be assessed in context with the associated histological features of the lesion...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We present histopathologic and {{immunohistochemical}} {{characteristics and}} differential diagnosis {{as well as}} possible pathogenetic mechanisms of benign <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> aggregates in five cases detected in axillary lymph nodes in patients operated for breast carcinoma. Material and Method: We examined axillary lymph nodes from 5 patients operated for breast carcinoma. Between August 1999 and January 2008. These lymph nodes were examined in detail with Hematoxylin and Eosin, anti-pancytokeratin, anti-S- 100, and anti- Ki- 67. Results: Of the lymph nodes with <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> aggregates, two were sentinel and three were non-sentinel lymph nodes of standard axillary dissection. All the lesions were small-sized and located in the lymph node capsule. Of these, two displayed nevus cells with cytoplasmic melanin pigment. Benign morphologic features of the lesions and immunohistochemical findings aided in differentiation from metastasis from either a breast carcinoma or a malignant melanoma. Conclusion: In spite of their rarity, keeping the existence of <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> aggregates in lymph nodes in mind, that nowadays we examine in an extreme detail, would help us avoid a misdiagnosis of metastasis...|$|E

Mice bearing the Cdk 4 (R 24 c) ::Tyr-NRAS(Q 1 K) transgenes develop congenital nevus-like lesions by post-natal day 10, from melanocytes escaping the confines of hair follicles.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{for the development}} of acquired melanocytic nevi remain mostly unclear. Here we report a case of eruptive nevi that developed after localized superficial trauma, and review the currently known cellular and triggering factors for acquired melanocytic nevi. A 66 -year-old woman presented a linear arrangement of pigmented macules on her left calf that developed after a bloodless skin erosion on the same spot, resulting from friction with the lining of a ski boot. Dermatopathology identified multiple junctional proliferations of single or small nest-forming melanocytes with bridging, pigment incontinence and moderate cellular atypia. The number of a person's nevi correlates with age, race and genetics, but blistering diseases, scarring processes, light exposure and immunosuppression can contribute to nevocellular growth as well. Damaged keratinocytes and inflammatory cells can release growth factors inducing <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation, and immunosuppression could end cellular surveillance keeping preexisting <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> nests in check. We conclude that in predisposed patients, the trigger for eruptive nevi can be reduced to a simple localized minor trauma...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that acquired nevi undergo life span continuous evolution from junctional, presumably in radial expanding phase at the dermal epidermal junction, to compound {{and then to}} dermal nested nevi. In an attempt to correlate the morphology of nevi with biological data, we have investigated whether migratory and adhesive phenotypes of <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> could account for histological patterns and possible spatiotemporal changes in nevi. <b>Nevus</b> <b>cells</b> were cultured from compound and dermal nevi and compared to normal epidermal cultured melanocytes from children and adults. All <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> showed similar in vitro adhesive and migratory indexes on laminin- 1, laminin- 5 /nicein, fibronectin, or collagen IV substrates, suggesting that these intrinsic characteristics do {{not account for the}} tendency to dermal nesting and/or to radial growth along the dermal epidermal junction. The cells from epidermal and dermal parts of compound nevi migrated similarly across a reconstituted basement membrane. The results show that intrinsic adhesive and migratory behaviors of <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> were not associated with a histological type of nevus. Interestingly. differences in migratory phenotype and intercellular adhesion capacities between <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> and normal melanocytes indicated that they could represent different melanocytic cell subpopulations.

40|$|Cells {{isolated}} from congenital melanocytic nevi and cultured in vitro have growth characteristics that resemble their pre-malignant stage in situ. A serum-free, chemically defined medium {{has been developed}} that allows continuous growth of established nevus cultures for up to several months. Like primary melanoma <b>cells,</b> <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> in high-calcium. containing W 489 medium require insulin for growth. In contrast to melanoma <b>cells,</b> <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> in serum-free medium require the presence of α-melanocyte – stimulating hormone, which enhanced intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. In contrast {{to the requirements of}} normal human melanocytes from newborn foreskin, congenital <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> grow with less dependency on basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).

40|$|Melanocytes, {{the pigment}} forming {{cells of the}} skin, form an almost nonproliferating cell {{population}} located to the lowermost part of the epidermis. Normally melanocytes are not found higher in the epidermis or in the dermis. Nevi consist of melanocytes with altered growth characteristics and localization. [*]The common pigmented nevus, a benign skin lesion, develops when melanocytes proliferate in the dermo–epidermal junction or in the dermis. Here we report growth characteristics of in[*]vitro cultured normal human melanocytes and dermal nevus-derived melanocytes. As previously reported, <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> have a moderate to high FGF- 2 expression level. Here we demonstrate that dermal <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> are able to survive in three-dimensional type 1 collagen culture, while normal human melanocytes rapidly undergo apoptosis. Melanocytes also, however, survive in collagen cultures {{in the presence of}} exogenous FGF- 2. The survival of <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> in collagen is suppressed by protamine, an inhibitor of FGF-mediated cell stimulation. The in[*]vivo growth environment of dermal <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> consists largely of type I and type III collagens.

40|$|Epigenetic {{inactivation}} of tumor-related genes is {{an important}} characteristic in the pathology of human cancers, including melanomagenesis. We analyzed the epigenetic inactivation of Claudin 11 (CLDN 11) in malignant melanoma (MM) of the skin, including six melanoma cell lines, 39 primary melanoma, 41 metastases of MM and 52 <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> nevi (NCN). CLDN 11 promoter hypermethylation was found in 19 out of 39 (49 %) of the primary MM and in 21 out of 41 (51 %) of the MM metastases, but only in eight out of 52 (15 %) of NCN (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 0003, respectively). Moreover, {{a significant increase in}} the methylation level of CLDN 11 from primary melanomas to MM metastases was revealed (p = 0. 003). Methylation of CLDN 11 was significantly more frequent in skin metastases (79 %) compared to brain metastases (31 %; p = 0. 007). CLDN 11 methylation was also found in five out of six MM cell lines (83 %) and its promoter hypermethylation correlated with a reduced expression. Treatment of MM cell lines with a DNA methylation inhibitor reactivated CLDN 11 transcription by its promoter demethylation. In summary, CLDN 11 proved to be an epigenetically inactivated tumor related gene in melanomagenesis, and analysis of CLDN 11 methylation level represents a potential tool for assisting in the discrimination between malignant melanoma and <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> nevi...|$|E

40|$|Melanocytic nevi {{are thought}} to be senescent clones of melanocytes that have {{acquired}} an oncogenic BRAF mutation. BRAF mutation {{is considered to be a}} crucial step in the initiation of melanocyte transformation. However, using immunomagnetic separation or laser-capture microdissection, we examined BRAF mutations in sets of approximately 50 single cells isolated from acquired melanocytic nevi from 13 patients and found a substantial number of nevus cells that contained wild-type BRAF mixed with nevus cells that contained BRAFV 600 E. Furthermore, we simultaneously amplified BRAF exon 15 and a neighboring single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs 7801086, from <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> samples obtained from four patients who were heterozygous for this SNP. Subcloning and sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products showed that both SNP alleles harbored the BRAFV 600 E mutation, indicating that the same BRAFV 600 E mutation originated from different cells.

In lentigo maligna melanomas and acral lentiginous melanomas, the mean percentages of β 2 M-positive tumor cells were significantly lower in thick (> 1. 50 mm) primary lesions and metastases than in thin (≦ 1. 50 mm) primary lesions. The evidence suggests that melanocyte-derived melanoma clones with a low grade of malignancy preserve class 1 HLA expression, and that the clones with a high grade of malignancy tend to lose the antigen expression. <b>Nevus</b> <b>cells</b> in common nevi {{have little or no}} expression of β 2 M.

40|$|AbstractBasement {{membranes}} found around {{tumor cells}} in nevocytic nevi, Spitz's nevi, and malignant melanomas {{were analyzed by}} electron microscopy and antibody staining for several basement membrane proteins. Nevocytic nevi and Spitz's nevi showed a distinct, occasionally discontinuous lamina densa {{regardless of whether they}} were located in junctional zones of the epidermis or within the dermis. All basement membranes around nests of aggregated nevus cells, however, lacked anchoring fibrils. This correlated with the absence of type VII collagen. In contrast, type IV collagen, laminin, and nidogen were present at the periphery of the <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> clusters in agreement with the presence of an intact lamina densa. Aggregated tumor cells in malignant melanomas were bordered by a lamina densa when located in a junctional position and lacked this structure when they had migrated into the dermis. This process was accompanied by a drastically reduced staining for collagen type IV and nidogen, whereas laminin was still detectable. Anchoring fibrils and their molecular correlate, type VII collagen, were consistently absent. These observations demonstrate major alterations in the composition of basement membranes around malignant melanomas, which can be an important factor for the invasive growth and formation of metastases of these tumors...|$|E
40|$|Nevus {{cells are}} of {{biologic}} interest {{because of their}} uncertain relationship to epidermal melanocytes and of clinical interest because of their statistical association with melanoma. We report a technique that allows reliable cultivation of nevus cells from small acquired and congenital nevi and permits in vitro characterization of this cell type. Morphologically, cultured nevus cells were found to closely resemble epidermal melanocytes from the same or comparably aged donors, manifesting marked dendricity and specific ultrastructural features characteristic of melanocytes; but could be distinguished {{by the presence of}} occasional large binucleate or trinucleate cells and by the frequent finding of grouped melanosomes in <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> cytoplasm. Growth kinetics were also similar for nevus cells and epidermal melanocytes, with population doubling times of 1 - 2 weeks in hormone-supplemented serum-fre-medium, and substantial growth enhancement by fetal bovine serum. As previously noted for epidermal melanocytes, nevus cells in serum-free culture demonstrated striking substrate responsiveness, with far greater attachment rates and degree of cytoplasmic spreading on fibronectin or type I/III collagen than on laminin, type IV collage, or uncoated plastic. These strong similarities in vitro suggest that morphologic and behavioral differences observed between epidermal melanocytes and nevus cells in the skin may result from local environmental influences rather than from intrinsic cellular differences. The availability of a satisfactory culture system for nevus cells may facilitate future investigations into their malignant potential and other biologic features...|$|E

The RASSF 2 promoter was epigenetically downregulated in two MM cell lines only, {{but not in}} any of the investigated tumor samples. In contrast, hypermethylation of the RASSF 10 promoter was found in all investigated cell lines, 19 / 28 (68 %) of the primary MM and 30 / 33 (91 %) of the MM metastases, 2 / 18 (11 %) of the dysplastic NCN, and 0 / 29 (0 %) of the non-dysplastic NCN (difference between MM and all nevi, P< 0. 001). RASSF 10 promoter hypermethylation correlated with a reduced RASSF 10 mRNA expression in 3 / 4 MM cell lines, and treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor reactivated RASSF 10 transcription. Furthermore, immunohistological RASSF 10 expression corresponds negatively to its promoter methylation state.

40|$|The histologic {{presence}} of benign dermal <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> in contiguity with primary cutaneous melanoma, {{as a distinct}} population separate from malignant melanocytes, was evaluated in a large referral data base. The melanomas were limited to superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) and nodular melanoma (NM). Overall, dermal melanocytic nevi were found associated with 1126 of 1954 primary SSM/NM (57. 6 %). When the melanomas were stratified by tumor thickness, an inverse relationship between the {{presence of}} benign <b>nevus</b> <b>cells</b> and tumor thickness was found: 64. 9 % of tumors less than 0. 76 mm and 64. 5 % of those between 0. 76 and 1. 69 mm were associated with dermal nevi, whereas in the thickness range 1. 70 – 3. 60 mm, there were 45. 6 % associated nevi, and in melanomas greater than 3. 60 mm, there were only 32. 0 % noted to have <b>nevus</b> <b>cells.</b> When melanomas were separated by nevus type, {{it was found that}} 41 % were associated with an acquired pattern nevus, 38 % with congenital pattern nevus, and 21 % with dysplastic nevus.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionA {{positive}} {{finding of}} metastatic melanoma in a sentinel lymph node is an ominous sign {{and a strong}} predictor of overall survival. In contrast, current data trends have shown that patients with benign nevus cells in the sentinel nodes do not require additional therapy since their prognosis {{has been shown to}} be similar to that of patients with negative lymph nodes. Distinguishing between benign capsular nevi and metastatic melanoma often proves to be diagnostically problematic. Case presentationIn this case report we present two cases of melanoma in which sentinel lymph node biopsies proved to be difficult in distinguishing metastatic melanocytes from capsular nevus cells. In both cases, further workup was necessary for accurate diagnoses. DiscussionA lack of standardized distinctions of benign <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> from melanoma pose a diagnostic pitfall. Assigning a diagnosis of malignant melanoma might seem like the safer approach to avoid a false negative, but the resultant treatment, including the possibility of additional surgical complications, may cause anxiety, discomfort, and financial instability for the patient. Current methods of distinguishing the two based solely on histology may be insufficient due to similar pathologic patterns. ConclusionTo avoid misdiagnosing a patient and performing unnecessary therapy, it would be beneficial to get a second opinion by additional histopathologists at a high volume center. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining should be carefully employed due to some overlap in commonly used markers. Using tissue morphology in conjunction with immunohistochemical staining may be the best way to make the most accurate diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the altered expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-Sm) in human benign, pre-malignant, and malignant pigment cell tumors by immunohistochemical {{as well as}} biochemical (Western blot) analysis using anti-α–Sm monoclonal antibody (anti-α–Sm MoAb). The expression of α-Sm has been revealed immunohistochemically {{to be associated with}} mesodermal cells rather than with pigment cells. Western blot analysis using anti-α-Sm MoAb detected α-Sm expression as a 43 -kD band in the extracts from normal papillary dermis, <b>nevus</b> <b>cell</b> nevus, and metastatic melanoma with stromal tissues, but not from primary melanoma with stromal tissues examined. The above findings of α-Sm expression by Western blot analysis were further characterized immunohistochemically in terms of the localization at the cellular level as follows. 1) In normal papillary dermis, pericytes encircling capillary vessels showed only positive staining with anti-α-Sm MoAb. 2) In nevus tissues, nevus cells were not shown to be positively stained, despite similar positivity of pericytes in normal papillary dermis. 3) In melanoma tissues, α-Sm expression of metastatic melanoma detected by Western blot analysis was found to be derived from fibroblasts with smooth-muscle differentiation (myofibroblasts), but not from melanoma cells. Such myofibroblastic stromal changes could not be found on primary melanoma tissue section, which showed no reactivity in Western blot analysis. We conclude that the major sources of α-Sm in benign and premalignant pigment cell tumors are capillary pericytes, whereas α-Sm found in malignant melanoma tissue is primarily from melanoma-surrounding stromal fibroblasts that were changed to myofibroblasts by some cytokine factor(s), presumably secreted from melanoma cells...|$|E

The separation procedure used provided cultures that were essentially free from normal melanocytes (dermis) or fibroblasts (epidermis). In short term culture, nevus cells of all skin compartments expressed markers associated with differentiated melanocytes, such as presence of premelanosomes and melanosomes and elevated tryosinase levels. Nevus cells also expressed melanoma-associated antigens, such as NGF-receptor, transferrin-related p 97, proteoglycan, and HLA-DR as detected with monoclonal antibodies. After several subpassages, cells showed a decreased expression of melanoma-associated antigens, decreased tyrosinase levels, and melanosomes could no longer be detected. Morphologically, these cells were similar to fibroblasts. The disappearance of melanoma-associated cell surface antigens was concomitant with the appearance of a melanocyte-associated 145 kd protein that might serve as a marker of fibroblast-like differentiation in nevus cells and normal melanocytes. <b>Nevus</b> <b>cell</b> cultures grown in the presence of 12 - 0 -tetradecanoyl phorbol- 13 -acetate maintained a stable differentiated phenotype throughout their lifespan. As reported earlier, nevus cells in culture, irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} 12 - 0 -tetradecanoyl phorbol- 13 -acetate, have a finite lifespan in vitro, grow anchorage-independent in soft agar, but do not form tumors when xenografted to nude mice.
