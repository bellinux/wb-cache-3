40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the perceptions of university students enrolled in teaching-degree programs regarding <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> Left Behind regulations and its impact on Special Education services. Data was collected through a voluntary survey given to students enrolled in coursework required to obtain teaching certification during the summer session of 2005. The participants were given a brief explanation of the study and its purpose. The university is located in a small, upper Midwest community. The survey was developed by the researcher based on current literature findings of special educators concerns of <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> Leff Behind's regulations. The participants were asked to evaluate how much impact <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> Leff Behind will have on the field of Special Education in the public schools.

The results show that the majority of participants believe <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> Left Behind will have a very significant impact on the four major concerns of current educators tha...|$|R

40|$|On January 8, 2002, President George W. Bush {{signed the}} <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> Left Behind Act of 2001 into law. The <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> Left Behind Act is an {{education}} reform act {{that is designed}} to improve student achievement so that <b>no</b> <b>child</b> gets left behind.

In order to raise awareness about what kind of changes <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> Left Behind will bring, a description is given concerning a part of the new law and what the State of Indiana is going to do to comply. Areas concentrated on were closing the achievement gap, rewarding success and sanctioning failure in the schools, informing parents, improving teacher quality, expanding flexibility, improving literacy, and making schools safer.

40|$|The <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> Left Behind Act of 2001 is {{designed}} to help create a national minimum standard in the United States‘ public education system by requiring states to implement accountability systems. I examine the effect of <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> Left Behind on private school enrollment using a difference in differences model. Using data from the Private School Universe Survey, conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, which is a survey conducted every two years and is mandatory for each American private school‘s administration to complete, I can evaluate the movement between public and private schools during the period when the requirements of <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> Left Behind were being implemented. I hypothesize that public schools have moved resources away from high achieving students toward the marginal students causing the high achieving students to enroll in private schools. Hence, private school enrollment will have increased due to <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> Left Behind. I find through my regressions that this hypothesis is true; the percentage of school-aged children in private schools increases after the signing of the <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> Left Behind Act...|$|R
