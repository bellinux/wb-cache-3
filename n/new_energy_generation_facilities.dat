By the winter of 2007, avalanches were responsible for at least 702 fatalities in Canada since the earliest recorded incident in 1782. Avalanches can affect people travelling and working on transportation corridors, ski area recreationists and workers, backcountry recreationists and guides, resource industry workers, <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> <b>facilities</b> and transmission lines, and people in or near public and residential buildings. In addition to hazard assessments, mitigation programs include forecasting and control programs for roads, railroads, ski areas, commercial backcountry recreation operations, resource industry worksites and roads, <b>energy</b> <b>generation</b> <b>facilities</b> and transmission lines, as well as public and residential land use areas. Public programs provide avalanche safety education and avalanche conditions reports, forecasts, and warnings to self-directed backcountry recreationists. However, non-mitigated avalanche threats exist to all activity types in Canada. With the exception of residential and public land use, the various types of activity in avalanche terrain are expected to either maintain current levels or increase...|$|R

As lon as capitalism survives, this will remain to be the case. However, during the current period of increasing scarcity and cost of energy [...] a period accompanied by higher than normal inflation rates [...] a proposed project may appear attractive and economic when, in fact, its demands on energy resources are extraordinarily high. Such a conclusion could well be the case when the major energy expenditure in construction or operation is directed toward a fuel, the price of which is held unusually low by legal regulation.
