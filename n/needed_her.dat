5|$|She {{was thought}} to have {{committed}} suicide, but took on the alias, , {{to serve as the}} leader of the Resistance before joining the group. Her desire for revenge against Archadia, for the horrors its army committed on her people, was manipulated by the Occuria to reinforce their rule over Ivalice. Along the course of the story, the Occuria created an image of the late Rasler to lead Ashe wherever they <b>needed</b> <b>her</b> to go. In their encounter, the Occuria offered her nethicite to rule as another Dynast-King, and conquer Ivalice in their stead. At the final moment, however, Ashe rejected Occuria's offer to use the nethicite. Ashe acknowledges Larsa's intention to stop the war and finally makes her way to Vayne in the Sky Fortress Bahamut to end it. A year after the Bahamut's crash, Ashe is crowned Queen of Dalmasca and eventually rejoins her friends in protecting the peace from the mysterious Judge of Wings in Revenant Wings. She is also featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy XII.|$|E

In reply, Grey {{pointed out that}} Britain <b>needed</b> <b>her</b> continental allies more than they <b>needed</b> <b>her,</b> and Britain could not, e.g. by reneging on the promise that Russia could have Constantinople, risk them making a compromise peace which left Germany stronger on the continent.|$|E

25|$|The {{originality}} and {{the novelty}} of the form of her foundation, which desired {{to be recognized as}} an authentic religious institution, with a public profession of vows, aroused many perplexities and open hostility, especially in the Roman ecclesiastic environment. The various difficulties were overcome, and in June 1890 the “Istituto delle Ancelle del Sacro Cuore di Gesù” (Institute of the Handmaids of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) obtained the Decree of Praise by the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars, without changing its innovative design. Caterina Volpicelli died on December 28, 1894, leaving great uncertainty in the young institution, which would have still <b>needed</b> <b>her</b> charismatic presence.|$|E
25|$|In the 50s BC, Cicero's {{letters to}} Terentia became shorter and colder. He complained {{to his friends}} that Terentia had betrayed him but did not specify in which sense. Perhaps the {{marriage}} simply could not outlast the strain of the political upheaval in Rome, Cicero's involvement in it, and various other disputes between the two. The divorce appears {{to have taken place}} in 51 BC or shortly before. In 46 or 45 BC, Cicero married a young girl, Publilia, who had been his ward. It is thought that Cicero <b>needed</b> <b>her</b> money, particularly after having to repay the dowry of Terentia, who came from a wealthy family. This marriage did not last long.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, actress Barbara Windsor's {{decision}} to leave EastEnders after sixteen years of portraying the character Peggy Mitchell was announced. The show's executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood, {{said it was a}} massive honour for him to be responsible for the character's exit, but explained that as she has become the [...] "quintessential matriarch of the show", they had to get the exit storyline right, which he said would be [...] "both epic and poignant". Windsor gave one year's notice of leaving, giving the production team time {{to come up with a}} storyline, and was asked to keep her decision a secret until the announcement was made. Kirkwood looked at Windsor's first episode and decided her exit should be about Peggy and her son Phil, as Peggy's arrival came at a time when Phil <b>needed</b> <b>her</b> most, and since then, she had believed that Phil still <b>needed</b> <b>her.</b> Peggy's exit came when she realised his mother was not what Phil needed. Windsor did not want to know in advance how her character would leave, but hoped she would not be killed off. She commented: [...] "My exit was beautifully written and I really couldn’t have asked for a better send-off for Peggy." ...|$|E

Furthermore, substantial repairs on the rigging were needed, and she <b>needed</b> <b>her</b> hull heated to kill worms.

500|$|Most of Martha's storylines were {{central to}} her on-off {{relationship}} with Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien). Viewers saw the couple go through marriage, divorce, a second marriage and Martha being widowed. Holy Soap said that Martha and Jack {{proved to be}} one of the [...] "best loved couples", before they married for the first time. However, their marriage does not last long and they split. Martha and Jack start to lead separate lives, but Jack is there for Martha after she has an abortion. Martha is feeling low at this point and kisses him; Jack's girlfriend Sam Tolhurst (Jessica Chapnik) sees this. O'Brien stated: [...] "I think Jack felt like 'Oh this is nice, but I've moved on, I've finally moved on and found someone', but deep down he still wants Martha." [...] Martha is left [...] "shattered" [...] after Jack plans to marry Sam. Martha was caught trying on Sam's wedding dress as she tried to figure out if she still had feelings for Jack. Gordon said that from day one, Jack and Martha have wanted to be together, but [...] "they're never in the same headspace". O'Brien added that he believes Jack was always in love with Martha, even whilst he was in a relationship with Sam. Both O'Brien and Gordon agreed that when Jack and Martha first broke up it was a bad time for Jack, as his life was spiraling out of control, he <b>needed</b> <b>her,</b> but she left him when he <b>needed</b> <b>her</b> the most. They later become friends; O'Brien believed it was hard to understand how Jack could be so forgiving toward her.|$|E
500|$|When the Second World War {{began in}} the {{following}} month, the ship was briefly transferred to Freetown for convoy escort duties before returning to South Africa. She returned to Freetown in January 1940 and remained there until she <b>needed</b> <b>her</b> bottom cleaned in June. On 13 September, Bridgewater rendezvoused with a convoy that was carrying troops intended to capture Dakar from the Vichy French, and resumed her former duties after its unsuccessful conclusion. The lack of docking facilities in Freetown forced the ship to return to Simonstown to have her hull cleaned in February 1941 and January 1942. In July, she escorted a convoy to the UK and then began a lengthy refit that saw her Vickers [...]50 machine guns replaced {{by a pair of}} [...] Oerlikon light AA guns, a Type 271 surface-search radar was installed and she also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast.|$|E

500|$|While Plumlee {{was working}} as a {{caseworker}} for the welfare department of Clackamas County, a woman police officer encouraged her to take a civil service test. She passed the test, and was selected from a pool of 300 applicants to fill the Portland Police Bureau's only open position. According to Louis Barker, his mother became a police officer [...] "for the money" [...] rather than to [...] "make the world safe". The family <b>needed</b> <b>her</b> income: Paul, a World War II veteran, suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder and had difficulty holding steady jobs, and Plumlee was also contributing to the support of her aging mother. She served in the unit known as the known as the Women's Protective Division from 1947 to 1967. Policewomen in that division did not work with male officers other than those assigned to the Juvenile Division, and did not wear uniforms. Their work focused on crimes like child abuse, domestic violence, and rape.|$|E
500|$|On August 2, {{after six}} weeks of taping and five {{completed}} shows, Schlatter was fired as producer. [...] Varying reports have Schlatter being fired by James Aubrey, Jr. (president of CBS) or by Garland herself, but in either case, production was suspended for five weeks. [...] Also fired were several of the writing staff and choreographer Danny Daniels. Replacing Schlatter as executive producer was Norman Jewison, who shared {{a vision for the}} series that was closer to that of Aubrey's. That vision was that Garland was too glamorous for television and that she <b>needed</b> <b>her</b> series to present her in a more conventional light. Veteran musical variety show writers John Aylesworth and Frank Peppiatt were brought in as well. Jewison, who had agreed to serve as producer through the thirteenth episode, implemented changes designed to [...] "make the sacred cow less sacred," [...] including Garland's subjection to Van Dyke's jokes that denigrated her issues with her weight, her reputation for unreliability and her career highs and lows. Jewison also introduced a new recurring feature, [...] "Be My Guest," [...] with Tormé's writing tailored material for the week's guest to perform with Garland near the top of each show.|$|E
