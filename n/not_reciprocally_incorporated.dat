40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{have taken}} {{advantage}} of the unique property of a potent dendritic cell (DC) growth factor, Flt- 3 ligand (FL), which could act as a vaccine adjuvant. Accordingly, a single injection of plasmid DNA coding for soluble FL (FLex) was shown to induce large numbers of DCs in various tissue compartments and was critical for generating high frequencies of antigen-specific (HIV gp 120 and LCMV NP) immune responses in mice. Interestingly, this enhanced level of immune response is strictly dependent on the co-delivery (i. m.) of the DNA vaccines and hFLex DNA to mice harboring large numbers of DCs. The high frequencies of antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells were largely associated with the expansion phase of DCs in vivo. However, DC expansion and immune enhancement have <b>not</b> <b>reciprocally</b> maintained a linear correlation, suggesting that other factors, cytokines/chemokines, which have the potential to modulate the microenvironment of DCs, could influence immunological outcome in this vaccination modality...|$|R

Unsurprisingly, the datacenter network is often the performance bottleneck for distributed filesystems.

By having more information and controlling both the filesystem and the network, Mayflower can perform optimizations that are unavailable to conventional distributed filesystems and network control planes.

In addition, we document long-distance horizontal transmission of symbionts between leaf-cutter ant species on mainland Central America and South America and those endemic to Cuba, suggesting both lack of pairwise coevolutionary specificity in ant/cultivar interactions and dispersal of symbionts independent of their ant hosts.

A brief preincubation of Penicillium mycelia with pyrithione resulted in a marked decrease {{in the activities of}} a variety of independently regulated transport systems, including those for inorganic sulfate, inorganic phosphate, methylamine (actually, the NH 4 + permease), choline-O-sulfate, glucose, l-methionine (a specific system), and several hydrophobic l-α-amino acids (the general amino acid permease). The degree of inhibition at any fixed pyrithione concentration and exposure time increased as the pH of the incubation medium was decreased. This result strongly suggests that the active species is the un-ionized molecule and that pyrithione acts by collapsing a transmembrane ΔpH driving force. The degree of transport inhibition caused by a given concentration of pyrithione increased with increasing time of exposure to the inhibitor.

40|$|Phylogeographic methods involve {{determining}} the historical relationships among gene lineages with {{attention to the}} contemporary spatial distribution of those lineages.

Ten haplotypes that differed by 1 - 5 bp at II nucleotide positions were identified. A phylogeny of these sequences indicates that these head and body lice are <b>not</b> from <b>reciprocally</b> monophyletic lineages.

Schizocosa ocreata and Schizocosa rovneri wolf spiders embody {{a classic example of}} species divergence resulting from such sexual selection, as they are reproductively isolated by courtship behavior alone. Here, we characterize a newly discovered population of wolf spiders in which brush-legged males (sensu S. ocreata) and non-ornamented males (sensu S. rovneri) are found syntopically. Mitochondrial sequence data (cytochrome oxidase subunit 1) indicate that the 2 male forms are <b>not</b> <b>reciprocally</b> monophyletic. We exposed subadult females from this mixed population to courtship advances from either brush-legged or non-ornamented males. Experienced females mated significantly more with brush-legged males, whereas inexperienced females showed no mating distinction.

Specifically, experience leads to a preference for brush-legged males. We also show that brush-legged males are more sexually aggressive than non-ornamented males. This study highlights the importance of prior experience on subsequent mate choice and has potential implications regarding the extent to which experience can influence polymorphism maintenance and/or species divergence and the evolution of secondary sexual traits.

Alosa alabamae was part of a polytomy with Alosa sapidissima, which was interpreted to support the recognition of A. alabamae as an incipient, yet distinct, species.

40|$|Abstract Background Malin is an E 3 -ubiquitin ligase that is mutated in Lafora disease, a fatal form of {{progressive}} myoclonus epilepsy. In order to perform its function, malin forms a functional complex with laforin, a glucan phosphatase that facilitates targeting of malin to its corresponding substrates. While laforin phylogeny has been studied, {{there are no}} data on the evolutionary lineage of malin. Results After an extensive search for malin orthologs, we found that malin is present in all vertebrate species and a cephalochordate, {{in contrast with the}} broader species distribution previously reported for laforin. These data suggest that in addition to forming a functional complex, laforin and perhaps malin may also have independent functions. In addition, we found that malin shares significant identity with the E 3 -ubiquitin ligase TRIM 32, which belongs to the tripartite-motif containing family of proteins. We present experimental evidence that both malin and TRIM 32 share some substrates for ubiquitination, although they produce ubiquitin chains with different topologies. However, TRIM 32 -specific substrates were <b>not</b> <b>reciprocally</b> ubiquitinated by the laforin-malin complex. Conclusions We found that malin and laforin are not conserved in the same genomes. In addition, we found that malin shares significant identity with the E 3 -ubiquitin ligase TRIM 32.

Cells undergoing apoptosis also display oxidized moieties on their surface membranes, as determined by binding of oxidation-specific monoclonal antibodies. In the present paper, we demonstrated by mass spectrometry that in comparison with viable cells, membranes of cells undergoing apoptosis contain increased levels of biologically active oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs). Indeed, immunization of mice with syngeneic apoptotic cells induced high autoantibody titers to various oxidation-specific epitopes of oxidized LDL, including OxPLs containing phosphorylcholine, whereas immunization with viable thymocytes, primary necrotic thymocytes, or phosphate-buffered saline did <b>not.</b> <b>Reciprocally,</b> these antisera specifically bound to apoptotic cells through the recognition of oxidation-specific epitopes.

Finally, we demonstrated that the OxPLs of apoptotic cells activated endothelial cells to induce monocyte adhesion, a proinflammatory response that was abrogated by an antibody specific to oxidized phosphatidylcholine.

This study showed that when Rhizobium sp. 127 E 15 nodulates a host of a different cross-inoculation group, it elicits the same specific host responses as it does from a host of the same cross-inoculation group...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and {{nitric oxide}} (NO), two {{endogenous}} gaseous molecules in endothelial cells, got increased attention {{with respect to}} their protective roles in the cardiovascular system. However, the details of the signaling pathways between H 2 S and NO in endothelia cells remain unclear. In this study, a treatment with NaHS profoundly increased the expression and the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Elevated gaseous NO levels were observed by a novel and specific fluorescent probe, 5 -amino- 2 -(6 -hydroxy- 3 -oxo- 3 H-xanthen- 9 -yl) benzoic acid methyl ester (FA-OMe), and quantified by flow cytometry. Further study indicated an increase of upstream regulator for eNOS activation, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and protein kinase B (Akt). By using a biotin switch, the level of NO-mediated protein S-nitrosylation was also enhanced. However, with the addition of the NO donor, NOC- 18, the expressions of cystathionine-γ-lyase, cystathionine-β-synthase, and 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase were not changed. The level of H 2 S was also monitored by a new designed fluorescent probe, 4 -nitro- 7 -thiocyanatobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole (NBD-SCN) with high specificity. Therefore, NO did <b>not</b> <b>reciprocally</b> increase the expression of H 2 S-generating enzymes and the H 2 S level. The present study provides an integrated insight of cellular responses to H 2 S and NO from protein expression to gaseous molecule generation, which indicates the upstream role of H 2 S in modulating NO production and protein S-nitrosylation...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{geologic}} {{history of}} the southeastern United States has {{played a major role}} in shaping the geographic distributions of amphibians in the region. In the phylogeographic literature, the predominant pattern of distribution shifts through time of temperate species is one of contraction during glacial maxima and persistence in refugia. However, the diverse biology and ecology of amphibian species suggest that a "one-size-fits-all" model may be inappropriate. Nearly 10 % of amphibian species in the region have a current distribution comprised of multiple disjunct, restricted areas that resemble the shape of Pleistocene refugia identified for other temperate taxa in the literature. Here, we apply genetics and spatially explicit climate analyses to test the hypothesis that the disjunct regions of these species ranges are climatic refugia for species that were more broadly distributed during glacial maxima. We use the salamander Plethodon serratus as a model, as its range consists of four disjunct regions in the Southeast. Phylogenetic results show that P. serratus is comprised of multiple genetic lineages, and the four regions are <b>not</b> <b>reciprocally</b> monophyletic. The Appalachian salamanders form a clade sister to all other P. serratus. Niche and paleodistribution modeling results suggest that P. serratus expanded from the Appalachians during the cooler Last Glacial Maximum and has since been restricted to its current disjunct distribution by a warming climate. These data reject the universal applicability of the glacial contraction model to temperate taxa and reiterate the importance of considering the natural history of individual species...|$|R
5000|$|Emperor Ming died in 472, {{leaving the}} throne to {{his young son}} Emperor Houfei. Emperor Ming's will {{entrusted}} the governmental matters to Yuan Can and Chu Yuan, {{and the two of}} them tried to reform government to eliminate corruption, but were prevented from doing so by Emperor Ming's attendants Ruan Dianfu (阮佃夫) and Wang Daolong (王道隆), who remained powerful even after his death. In winter 472, Yuan and Chu also incorporated Emperor Ming's cousin Liu Bing into the decision process. In 473, Yuan Can's mother died, and he left the government to observe a three-year mourning period for her. (It was at this juncture that Yuan's relationship with Chu deteriorated, as years earlier, when Chu's mother died, Yuan had, on orders from the emperor, persuaded him from abandoning the mourning period, but now would <b>not</b> <b>reciprocally</b> accept Chu's entreaties to return to the government—thus making his own reputation greater than Chu's, causing Chu to be displeased.) He did, however, return to the government on an emergency basis after Emperor Qianfei's uncle Liu Xiufan (劉休範) the Prince of Guiyang rebelled and attacked the capital Jiankang, and he later participated in a final battle in which the imperial troops, mostly under the command of Xiao Daocheng, defeated Liu Xiufan's troops. He thereafter remained in the imperial government, and, with Xiao also now included in the decision process after his victory, became known as one of the [...] "four nobles" [...] (四貴) along with Chu, Liu Bing, and Xiao.|$|R
30|$|To {{achieve the}} {{research}} goal, the present qualitative study examined what undergraduates completing an online introductory subject perceived were key {{advantages and disadvantages}} of DE based upon their lived-experiences. Thematic analysis permitted identification of three broad themes. The first theme reflected beliefs about the superiority of face-to-face learning interactions with peers and lecturers and a fear-of-missing-out on ‘real’/ ‘internal’ classroom experiences non-DE students were receiving for the same tuition. Second was the perception that TMC, particularly with lecturers, needed to be immediately received by students, yet <b>not</b> <b>reciprocally</b> expected by lecturers of students who were paying customers. The importance of flexibility students’ expectations/requests, including the capacity to ‘learn anywhere’ were valued advantages of DE, yet countered by having to be inconvenienced by ‘irritating’ TMC from peers. Finally, while students’ felt they were always online, technology failed to ameliorate the social isolation online learning encultured. Findings highlight the importance of rejecting notions of who the ‘typical’ DE learner is and point to the urgent need for systemic consideration of how and what institutional communication practices and preferences are considered most desirable and why. Perceptions of CMC/TMC illustrated normative expectations that online learning ought to mirror stereotypical face-to-face interactions in internal classrooms, regardless of technical capacity or experience. Students’ lived-experiences demonstrated online academic communication was perceived enabling degree completion albeit inevitably was an inferior substitute for face-to-face learning, perpetuating broader social norms and biases that CMC/TMC are poor ‘substitutes’ disadvantaged individuals must try their best to cope with as they ‘miss out’ on ‘real’ classroom experiences.|$|R
