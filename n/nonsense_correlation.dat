40|$|Yule (1926) {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} spurious or <b>nonsense</b> <b>correlation,</b> and showed by simulation that for some nonstationary processes, that the empirical correlations seem not to converge in probability even if the processes were inde- pendent. This was later discussed by Granger and Newbold (1974), and Phillips (1986) found the limit distributions. We propose to distinguish between empirical and population correlation coefficients and show in a bivariate autoregressive model for nonstationary variables that the empirical correlation and regression coe¢ cients do not converge to the relevant population values, due to the trending nature of the data. We conclude by giving a simple cointegration analysis of two interests. The analysis illustrates that much more insight can be gained about the dynamic behavior of the nonstationary variables then simply by calculating a correlation coefficient. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of R-squared in Model Selection is {{a common}} {{practice}} in econometrics. The rationale is that the statistic produces a consistent estimator of the true coefficient of determination for the underlying data while taking into consideration the number of variables involved in the model. This pursuit of parsimony comes with a cost: The researcher has no control over the error probabilities of the statistic. Alternative measures of goodness of fit, such as the Schwarz Information Criterion, provide only a marginal improvement to the problem. The F-Test under the Neyman-Pearson testing framework will provide the best alternative for model selection criteria.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{trending}} time series can admit valid regression representations {{even when the}} dependent variable and the regressors are statistically independent, i. e., in situations that are presently characterized in the literature as "spurious regressions. " Our theory is directed mainly at the two classic examples of regressions of stochastic trends on time polynomials and regressions among independent random walks. But it has more general applicability and, we think, wider implications. Contrary to established wisdom, our theory justifies regressions of this type as valid models for the data. The radical conclusion that emerges from {{this study is that}} there are no spurious regressions for trending time series, just alternative valid representations of the limiting dependent variable process in terms of other stochastic processes and deterministic functions of time. We find statistical inference in such cases to be valid, not spurious, a conclusion that is in direct contrast to universal thinking about this subject since Yule (1926) first wrote about <b>nonsense</b> <b>correlations.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Four {{conservatism}} questionnaires (C-Scale; Wilson and Patterson, 1970; POI; Eysenck, 1976; MK; Cloetta, 1983; 16 PF-Q 1; Schneewind, Schröder and Cattell, 1983) {{were compared}} {{with regard to their}} ability to predict responses to humour based on the incongruity-resolution structure. We further investigated, whether a prediction of humour responses could be improved by assessing variables like toughmindedness, capitalism, rigidity and intolerance of ambiguity. The results showed that the conservatism scales overlap in their prediction of funniness of incongruity-resolution jokes, sex jokes and rejection of <b>nonsense</b> jokes. <b>Correlations</b> with the other humour scales were specific for certain conservatism questionnaires. A canonical correlation analysis relating the humour scores and the conservatism scales yielded three significant correlations (rc 1 = 0. 65, rc 2 = 0. 51 and rc 3 = 0. 44). Capitalism was also related to appreciation of incongruity-resolution jokes and of sex jokes. The previously found effects of intolerance of ambiguity could be replicated...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:Homozygous {{mutations}} in WWOX {{were reported in}} eight individuals of two families with autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 and in two siblings with infantile epileptic encephalopathy (IEE), including one who deceased prior to DNA sampling. METHODS:By combining array comparative genomic hybridisation, targeted Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing, we identified five further patients from four families with IEE due to biallelic alterations of WWOX. RESULTS:We identified eight deleterious WWOX alleles consisting in four deletions, a four base-pair frameshifting deletion, one missense and two <b>nonsense</b> mutations. Genotype-phenotype <b>correlation</b> emerges from the seven reported families. The phenotype in four patients carrying two predicted null alleles was characterised by (1) little if any psychomotor acquisitions, poor spontaneous motility and absent eye contact from birth, (2) pharmacoresistant epilepsy starting in the 1 st weeks of life, (3) possible retinal degeneration, acquired microcephaly and premature death. This contrasted with the less severe autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 phenotype due to hypomorphic alleles. In line with this correlation, the phenotype in two siblings carrying a null allele and a missense mutation was intermediate. CONCLUSIONS:Our results obtained {{by a combination of}} different molecular techniques undoubtedly incriminate WWOX as a gene for recessive IEE and illustrate the usefulness of high throughput data mining for the identification of genes for rare autosomal recessive disorders. The structure of the WWOX locus encompassing the FRA 16 D fragile site might explain why constitutive deletions are recurrently reported in genetic databases, suggesting that WWOX-related encephalopathies, although likely rare, may not be exceptional...|$|R
