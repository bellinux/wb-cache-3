However, {{there is no evidence that}} members of Moscow-based Pussy Riot participated in this action.|$|E
5|$|The Chhera Pahara (sweeping with water) is a {{significant}} ritual associated with the Ratha Yatra. During this ritual, the Gajapati King wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots. The king cleans {{the road in front}} of the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder. As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannatha. This ritual signifies that under the lordship of Jagannatha, there is <b>no</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the powerful sovereign and the humblest devotee.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense.

Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was <b>no</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> principal and accessory.

Finally, the Court held that the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E
