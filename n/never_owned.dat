He <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> a television, {{and was in}} the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m and sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal possessions included his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left no will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother, who survived him.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a project}} of real estate {{developer}} and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the structure was built by Walter Chrysler, {{the head of the}} Chrysler Corporation. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. The building served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. Although the building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> it, as Walter P. Chrysler decided to pay for it himself, so that his children could inherit it.|$|E
5|$|Charles Alfred Cruft (28 June 1852 – 10 September 1938) was a British showman {{who founded}} the Crufts dog show. Charles first became {{involved}} with dogs {{when he began to}} work at Spratt's, a manufacturer of dog biscuits. He rose to the position of general manager, and whilst working for Spratt's in France he was invited to run his first dog show at the 1878 Exposition Universelle. After running dog shows in London for four years, he ran his first Cruft's dog show in 1891, and continued to run a further 45 shows until his death in 1938, as well as running two cat shows in 1894 and 1895. He was involved in a range of dog breed clubs, including that for Schipperkes, Pugs and Borzois. He and his wife upheld a story that they <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> a dog, and instead owned a cat, however Cruft admitted to owning at least one Saint Bernard in his memoirs, published posthumously.|$|E

5|$|In direct {{opposition}} to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866. Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson {{may have been too}} overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that her family brought in a permanent household servant, Margaret Maher, to replace the old one. Emily once again was responsible for chores, including the baking, at which she excelled.|$|E
5|$|Money was {{a problem}} in the McCartney house, as Jim only earned up to £6.00 a week, which was less than his wife. Because of their {{financial}} situation, the McCartney family could not afford to buy a television set until the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, and <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> a car. His two sons were the first in the McCartney family line to buy cars. When The Beatles became successful, Jim had to leave Forthlin Road because fans used to stand outside and stare through the windows, which made him feel uncomfortable and nervous. Eight years after Mary's death, Jim married , on 24 November 1964. Williams had a daughter from a previous marriage, Ruth, whom Jim legally adopted.|$|E
25|$|In 1856 {{the family}} moved from Warrington Place {{to the house of}} Susanna's parents at 18 Merrion Square (later number 70, the office of the Irish Arts Council). Her parents retired to live in England. Le Fanu <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> the house, but rented it from his {{brother-in-law}} for £22 per annum (which he still failed to pay in full).|$|E

25|$|Phelps never married, but {{lived with}} four {{different}} women throughout his lifetime. He {{was a major}} baseball fan, and had personal friendships with numerous well-known players of the time. Phelps received much of the attention {{of his mother and}} grandmother during his childhood; this led to a strained relationship with his sister, who remained embittered towards him {{for the rest of her}} life. She left America in the 1920s, and never spoke with him again. He preferred to live in hotels and move from place to place, and <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> any real estate.|$|E
25|$|McCarty <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> a car; {{she walked}} {{everywhere}} she went, pushing {{a shopping cart}} nearly a mile to get groceries. She rode with friends to attend services at the Friendship Baptist Church. She did not subscribe to any newspaper and considered the expense an extravagance. Similarly, although she owned a black-and white-television, she received only broadcast transmissions. In 1947, her uncle gave her the house in which she lived until her death. She also received some money from her aunt and mother when they died, which she placed into savings as well.|$|E

There were also some quite significant satellites such as liberal clergyman Arthur Stanley, the Dean of Westminster; and guests such as Charles Darwin and Hermann von Helmholtz were entertained {{from time to}} time. Through such associations, Spencer had a strong presence {{in the heart of}} the scientific community and was able to secure an influential audience for his views. Despite his growing wealth and fame he <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> a house of his own.|$|E

NBC's national network operations in both New York City and Los Angeles are housed in the same facilities as their local stations in the respective cities, WNBC and KNBC, and both of these O are considered flagship stations of the network (conversely, NBC's affiliate news service NBC News Channel is based out of the studios of WCNC-TV in Charlotte, North Carolina, which the network maintains an affiliation with but has <b>never</b> <b>owned).</b>|$|E
500|$|Director Ralph Bakshi was {{introduced}} to The Lord of the Rings during the mid-1950s while working as an animator for Terrytoons. In 1957, the young animator started trying {{to convince people that}} the story could be told in animation. In 1969, the rights were passed to United Artists, where filmmakers Stanley Kubrick and John Boorman each tried to adapt the story. (Contrary to an urban legend, Disney <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> the rights to The Lord of the Rings.) ...|$|E
500|$|In her spare time, she {{was mostly}} a home person, which dated {{back to her}} younger years, but on {{occasion}} went out and played laser tag.

500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{demands that}} Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) {{research}} his family tree. To spite him, she falsely {{tells him that}} he is related to U.S. First Lady [...] Michelle Obama. He begins to brag about his discovery, which causes his co-workers to wonder if Andy's family ever owned slaves. In order {{to get back at}} his co-workers, Andy asks Nellie to [...] "dig up dirt" [...] {{on the rest of the}} office. In turn, she makes up more fake facts as a prank. It is revealed by Andy's mother that the Bernards <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> slaves: they simply transported them.|$|E
500|$|Coffin {{explained}} in his autobiography, Reminiscences of Levi Coffin (1876), that he inherited his anti-slavery views from his parent and grandparents, who had <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> slaves. The Coffin family was {{greatly influenced by}} the teachings of John Woolman who believed that slaveholding was not fair. Coffin's parents probably met Woolman in 1767 during religious meetings held near their New Garden home with other non-slaveholding Quaker families. It is also likely that his cousin, Vestal Coffin, attended the meeting. (Vestal {{was one of the}} earliest Quakers to help slaves escape from North Carolina, beginning as early as 1819.) ...|$|E

What fun she was." [...] Novelist Hervey Allen called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir, [...] "the Stewart Avenue Gang". The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but those moments were followed by serious talk of the future of libraries, and {{the role of women in}} South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another. Douglas never learned to drive and <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> a car. Her house also had no air conditioning, electric stove, or dishwasher.|$|E

Mona Simpson is seen reading Steal This Book by Abbie Hoffman. Mona mentions that she worked a number of jobs while on the run, including [...] "marketing Jerry Rubin’s line of diet shakes, proofreading Bobby Seale’s cookbook, and running credit checks at Tom Hayden’s Porsche dealership." [...] Rubin, Seale and Hayden were three liberal radicals from the 1960s. Rubin did indeed have a line of diet shakes, and Bobby Seale did write some cookbooks.

500|$|When {{asked about}} his lyrics {{commanding}} a woman to [...] "do it doggy style" [...] in his song [...] "Do It Do It", Weaver stated that the lyrics are a reflection of his background and audience, and not necessarily {{how he feels about}} others. Weaver reflected on the song [...] "Saturday Night" [...] as being about [...] "my 17 year old Saturday night" [...] which consisted of going down to the Parkside Inn, drinking, and [...] "watching the bitches on the corner" [...] and that the song was not meant to be taken literally, but that he [...] "did come home once with a girl and I forgot my key and my mom was pissed off, but she didn't pull a gun; she's <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> a gun in her life".|$|E
500|$|The first {{carriages}} were [...] four-wheelers, [...] long. Painted a {{dark brown}} with yellow lining and lettering, they had Newall's chain brake and a seat for the guard on the roof.

Third class passengers were seated on wooden benches in a carriage seating 40 passengers sharing one oil lamp. The Great North <b>never</b> <b>owned</b> any second class carriages. Built by Brown, Marshall & Co, only half the number of carriages ordered had arrived {{for the start of}} public services in 1854. Later the guard's seat was removed and longer vehicles with six wheels were built. Accommodation for third class passengers was improved in the 1880s and the seats were upholstered.|$|E
