25|$|Donald McAdams {{wrote that}} in the 1990s, within trustee District 5 there were schools that were about 50% White that usually had ample parent support and {{stronger}} test scores while there were schools about 90% or higher minorities that had low test scores and little to no parent support. He explained that in Houston white parents sent children to HISD schools that had minority children {{as long as the}} minority children tended to be middle class and that there was not too many of them. Many black students who lived in District 5 were middle class children who took school buses to the schools and did not live in the school zones. According to McAdams their enrollment levels were stable and White parents were comfortable with their presence. He added that very poor black children tended to go to their <b>neighborhood</b> <b>schools</b> outside of District 5. McAdams also stated that White middle class parents did not consider Asians and Asian Americans to be minorities who could make a school less attractive to them. In the 1980s and 1990s increased enrollment of poor, non-English speaking Central American students at some HISD <b>neighborhood</b> <b>schools</b> made them unattractive to White parents.|$|E

As a result, students and families are likely to have broad social connections in all parts of the town rather than being limited to <b>neighborhoods.</b> <b>School</b> Choice also benefits the towns real estate market since home valuations are not impacted by the perceived desirability of given <b>neighborhood's</b> <b>school.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following the Regents vote, Lytle, Mehan, and Gourevitch, made {{changes to}} their plan.

CREATE {{would be responsible for}} maintaining Preuss as an example for other institutions of public education. In addition, it would coordinate efforts between the university and Preuss, including using the school for research on educational equality and for extending this research to other <b>neighborhood</b> <b>schools.</b> This second proposal was brought to the regents and, assisted by public outcry against the university and positive press for the school from The San Diego Union-Tribune, The Sacramento Bee, and the Los Angeles Times, it was approved.|$|E
25|$|According to the Christian Heritage Academy website, {{the school}} began in 1972 {{with a vision}} of Sunnyside Baptist Church and its pastor, Harry Boydstun. Prior to the school's founding, {{demographic}} changes in primary education were taking place in Oklahoma City and in other cities across America. In the 1971 Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of busing to end school segregation and dual school systems. The federal courts began mandating that enrollment be racially balanced {{in the public school}} systems and be achieved through the forced busing of elementary students. Many parents were alarmed that the public schools were being radically reorganized and their children would be transported miles across town to be taught in some other place than their <b>neighborhood</b> <b>schools.</b> The movement of large numbers of white families to suburbs of large cities, so-called white flight and a string of Supreme Court decisions, reduced the effectiveness of the busing policy.|$|E

40|$|Under this policy, {{students}} and their parent(s) /guardian(s) may apply to transfer to any district school other than their <b>neighborhood</b> <b>school</b> during open enrollment through the month of February for the following school year. In-district student transfer is only open to those students who are in good academic standing (no F grades and above 2. 0 GPA), have satisfactory attendance (no unexcused absences or excessive tardiness), and have no severe behavior violations (suspensions). When a student has been accepted by a school other than his/her <b>neighborhood</b> <b>school</b> during the open enrollment period, the student may continue there throughout the entire grade span without reapplying {{as long as they}} maintain satisfactory attendance, grades and behavior as stipulated above. He/she may return to the <b>neighborhood</b> <b>school</b> at the beginning of any school year by applying during the district open enrollment period. Siblings of students who are currently enrolled may be accepted for transfer to the same school provided the eligibility criteria for the transfer are met by the sibling. Students who transfer outside of their <b>neighborhood</b> <b>school</b> attendance area must reapply to attend the next level, e. g., elementary to middle school or middle school to high school, if they wish to attend a school other than their <b>neighborhood</b> <b>school.</b> Students may not change schools within the district after school has begun, except under special circumstances as determined by the District. Parents are responsible for transportation and supervision to and from a school outside of their neighborhood attendance area. The district central office retains the right to make exceptions to this policy upon review and for cause, as indicated in the procedures portion of this policy...|$|R
