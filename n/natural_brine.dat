40|$|Carbon dioxide {{sequestration}} using brines {{has emerged}} as a promising technology to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change due to its large storage capacity and favourable chemistries. However, the permanent storage (mineral trapping) of CO 2 in brines takes significantly long periods of time as the formation of carbonates is very slow. The main parameters (brine pH, system temperature and pressure, brine composition) have been reported to have the major effect on mineral trapping of CO 2 sequestration in brines. It is suggested that the precipitation of mineral carbonates is mostly dependent on brine pH and is favoured above a basic pH of 9. 0. In order to promote the formation of carbonates, brine pH could be enhanced by using additives. Synthetic brines were used in this study instead of <b>natural</b> <b>brines</b> due to the difficulty in obtaining and storing fresh <b>natural</b> <b>brines.</b> Therefore, the suitability of using synthetic brines as analogues of <b>natural</b> <b>brines</b> for CO 2 sequestration studies was evaluated firstly. The experimental studies were then conducted to assess a series of additives (host rock, buffer solutions and fly ash) and select the optimal additives that could maximise the precipitation of mineral carbonates and quantify the storage capacity of CO 2 via mineral trapping with additives. Finally, the geochemical modelling studies were conducted (by the code PHREEQC V 2) to assess the solubility trapping of CO 2 in brines with additives, and compared with the corresponding experimental results.

They named the 50, 000  mg/L brine as low-salinity brine. The reduction in IFT results in the weakening of the intermolecular forces between oil and brine which assisted by the gravity effects promotes oil detachment from the brine.

40|$|Compositions of coexisting {{liquid and}} vapor phases have been {{determined}} at temperatures from 250 to 350 °C for brines containing NaCl and either HCI or NaOH by direct sampling of both phases from a static phase-equilibration apparatus.

Thermodynamic partitioning constants for NaCl have been determined from the observed compositions of the coexisting phases combined with the known activity coefficients of NaCl(aq) in the liquid phase.

50|$|Salt {{is made in}} {{two ways}} traditionally. Rock salt is mined from the ground. The other type known as white salt is made by the {{evaporation}} of brine. Brine is obtained in several ways.

A Salt-on-Salt process strengthens brine by dissolving rock salt, and/ or, crystal salt in weak brine or sea water prior to evaporation.

40|$|The ancients {{considered}} <b>natural</b> <b>brines</b> to be azoic (Baas Becking, 1931 -A), but it {{has been}} recognized gradually that certain microscopically visible animals could survive in near-saturated brine solutions. Farlow (1880, 1886) was the first to study the microscopic entity associated with the reddening of salt codfish. Subsequently, bacteria were shown to be responsible for much of the biological activity observed in salt flats and lakes. Bacteria found in these environments were referred to as being “halophilic”. The term halophilic stems from two Greek words: halos and philus meaning respectively “salt” and “loving”. The extent to which bacteria may be considered as “salt loving” has been interpreted rather loosely by the several groups working with these bacteria. Rubentschik (1928), Hof (1935), and Sperlich (1912) applied the term to bacteria which found their optimum development at a certain salt concentration, regardless of their ability to grow in salt-free media; if the organism did not develop in fresh water media, it was considered an “obligate halophile”; if the bacteria developed optimally in salt-free media but could also grow in salt-containing media they were considered “halotolerant”. Horowitz-Wlassowa (1931) proposed the term “halobe” for those bacteria which grew only in nutrient media with added salts.

40|$|Magnesium oxide {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} magnesium compounds used in industry. The production of MgO is often done from calcined magnesium carbonate or from natural magnesium saline solutions (sea water and brines). In the case of these solutions, magnesium oxide is precipitated after the addition of a strong base (eg. Ammonia). Magnesium hydroxide is calcined after its separation from the excess resulting from the strong base through filtration. Thus, magnesia qualities may differ depending on several physical parameters and particularly on the nature of the compound. Consequently, two different compounds were selected: magnesium chloride and magnesium sulphate which can be recovered from Tunisian <b>natural</b> <b>brines.</b> Three physical factors were considered: calcination temperatures, precipitation temperatures and calcination time of Mg(OH) 2. The decomposition of Mg(OH) 2 was investigated by DTA/TGA. Mass losses vary in the range (23. 0 %- 29. 9 %). Starting decomposition temperatures are between 362 °C and 385 °C.

40|$|We report {{measurements}} of the zeta potential on intact limestone samples obtained using the streaming potential method (SPM), supplemented by the more ubiquitous electrophoretic mobility method (EPM). The effect of the potential-determining ions (PDI) Ca, Mg and SO 4, and the total ionic strength controlled by NaCl concentration, is investigated over the range typical of <b>natural</b> <b>brines.</b> We find that the zeta potential varies identically and linearly with calcium and magnesium concentration expressed as pCa or pMg. The zeta potential also varies linearly with pSO 4. The sensitivity of the zeta potential to PDI concentration, and the IEP expressed as pCa or pMg, both decrease with increasing NaCl concentration. We report considerably lower values of IEP than most previous studies, and the first observed IEP expressed as pMg. The sensitivity of the zeta potential to PDI concentration is lower when measured using the SPM compared to the EPM, owing to the differing location of the shear plane at which the zeta potential is defined. SPM measurements are more appropriate in natural porous samples because they reflect the mineral surfaces that predominantly interact with the adjacent fluids. We demonstrate that special cleaning procedures are required to return samples to a pristine zeta potential after exposure to PDIs. We apply our results to an engineering process: the use of modified injection brine composition to increase oil recovery from carbonate reservoirs. We find a correlation between an increasingly negative zeta potential and increased oil recovery...|$|R
40|$|Aqueous saline {{solutions}} are ubiquitous in both geological systems and engineering practices. With technological and industrial development, salts and saline fluids {{are more and}} more exploited for their physical chemistry properties and economical interests. Presently, one is able to apply some specific thermodynamic models (Pitzer, 1991) with more success to industrial and <b>natural</b> <b>brines</b> having a salinity as high as 10 -fold that of sea water. A non-exhaustive list of highly saline waters can be drawn as following: high salinity irrigation waters, hydrometallurgy (e. g., Bayer process), ore deposits genesis systems (e. g., MVT-mineralizing brines), oil-brines production (i. e., Smackover Formation, North Sea field, Williston basin, Alberta basin), geothermal brines with well bore scaling (i. e., HDR exchanger in Alsace), and saline Lakes. The complexity of the chemical composition of these brines can induce important uncertainties on the quantification of the brine density, a crucial parameter for many quantification, if the classical simplistic relation density vs salinity is used. Hence, the specificity of dominant salts as their mixtures {{must be taken into account}} in calculations of the brine densities for groundwater modelind. A thermodynamic database of the parameters of Pitzer from the literature data (Monnin, 1999; Krumgalz et al., 2000;) valid for temperatures ranging from 0 to 100 °C and of salinities up to saturation with various salts (i. e., Dead Sea) was compiled.

40|$|The {{impact of}} brine {{composition}} on rock wettability and oil recovery in carbonates {{has been an}} area of active research in recent years. Many studies have reported contradictory results and the underling mechanism(s) are actively debated. The zeta potential, which {{is a measure of}} the electrical charge at the mineral surface, is highly variable in carbonates, depending on the ionic composition of the pore water. The zeta potential controls the magnitude and polarity of the electrostatic interactions between the mineral surface and polar species in the brine and oil; it also controls the magnitude and polarity of the streaming potential, an electrical potential which arises in response to pressure gradients across saturated rocks. Here we report the use of streaming potential measurements to determine key controls on zeta potential at mineral-brine and oil-brine interfaces, and characterise wettability and optimise injection brine composition during controlled salinity waterflooding in carbonates at reservoir conditions of salinity and temperature. The zeta potential is controlled by the concentration-dependent adsorption of the lattice ions Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and CO 32 - within the Stern layer. A Nernstian relationship between zeta potential and pCa or pMg (where p represents the negative logarithm of concentration in M; 1 M = 1 mol L- 1) is observed over the range of typical <b>natural</b> <b>brines.</b> Addition of SO 42 - can affect zeta potential by moderating Ca 2 + in solution. The temperature dependence of the zeta potential can be correlated with the temperature dependence of pCa and shows a Nernstian linear relationship. The zeta potential in intact carbonate samples decreases with temperature at low ionic strength and independent of temperature at high ionic strength irrespective of brine composition. Thus, for a given carbonate type, zeta potential measurements in <b>natural</b> <b>brines</b> (e. g. saline aquifers, formation waters or seawater; ionic strength ??? 0. 5 M) at laboratory conditions may be applied in situ. The zeta potential at both the mineral-water and oil-water interfaces must be determined when characterising wettability and designing the optimum brine composition for controlled salinity waterflooding in carbonates. The experimental method presented here allows this to be done using intact core samples saturated with the crude oil and brine of interest. We find a monotonic relationship between zeta potential and wettability expressed in terms of the Amott water index (Iw). Thus, measurements of streaming potential can be used to characterise wettability more quickly and cheaply than existing laboratory methods. Results reported here demonstrate that the oil-water interface can be positively charged at the high pH and ionic strength relevant to the formation brines found in many carbonate reservoirs. It is usually assumed that the oil-brine interface is negatively charged. Improved recovery during controlled salinity waterflooding in carbonates is observed if the change in brine composition yields a zeta potential at each interface that has the same polarity, such that a repulsive electrostatic force acts between the interfaces and stabilizes a water film on the mineral surface. These results have broad application and significance in allowing oil companies to design water injection strategies that yield improved oil recovery from carbonate reservoirs. Open Acces...|$|R
