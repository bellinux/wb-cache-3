5|$|Enolate {{trapping}} {{with various}} electrophiles is decidedly less common. In one study, the Nazarov cyclization is {{paired with a}} Michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to β-nitrostyrene. In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions: it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization {{and in the next}} step the <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R-group.|$|E

25|$|The Barton–Zard {{synthesis}} proceeds in {{a manner}} similar to the Van Leusen synthesis. An isocyanoacetate reacts with a nitroalkene in a 1,4-addition, followed by 5-endo-dig cyclization, elimination of the <b>nitro</b> <b>group,</b> and tautomerization.|$|E

50|$|This {{technology}} {{is based on}} decomposition of explosive substance followed by {{the reduction of the}} <b>nitro</b> <b>groups.</b> Most military grade explosives are nitro compounds and have an abundance of NO2 groups on them. Explosive vapors are pulled into an adsorber at a high rate and then pyrolized. The presence of <b>nitro</b> <b>groups</b> in the pyrolized products is then detected. This technology has significantly more false alarms because many other harmless compounds also have an abundance of <b>nitro</b> <b>groups.</b> For example, most fertilizers have <b>nitro</b> <b>groups</b> which are falsely identified as explosives, and the sensitivity of this {{technology is}} also fairly low. A popular detector using this technology is Scientrex EVD 3000.|$|R
50|$|The nitronickelates are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} compounds containing a nickel atom complexed by <b>nitro</b> <b>groups,</b> -NO2.Nickel can be in a +2 or +3 oxidation state.

25|$|Azathioprine is {{synthesized}} from 5-chloro-1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazole and 6-mercaptopurine in {{dimethyl sulfoxide}} (DMSO). The {{synthesis of the}} former starts with an amide from methylamine and diethyl oxalate, which is then cyclizised and chlorinated with phosphorus pentachloride; the <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> is introduced with nitric and sulfuric acid.|$|E
25|$|The second {{substitution}} reaction (on the right) is slower {{because the}} first <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> is deactivating. Conversely, if an activating group (electron-donating) was introduced (e.g., alkyl), a second substitution reaction would occur more readily than {{the first and the}} disubstituted product might accumulate to a significant extent.|$|E
25|$|Nitric acid is {{the primary}} reagent used for {{nitration}} – {{the addition of a}} <b>nitro</b> <b>group,</b> typically to an organic molecule. While some resulting nitro compounds are shock- and thermally-sensitive explosives, a few are stable enough to be used in munitions and demolition, while others are still more stable and used as pigments in inks and dyes. Nitric acid is also commonly used as a strong oxidizing agent.|$|E

25|$|Being a {{powerful}} oxidizing acid, nitric acid reacts violently with many organic {{materials and the}} reactions may be explosive. The hydroxyl group will typically strip a hydrogen from the organic molecule to form water, and the remaining <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> takes the hydrogen's place. Nitration of organic compounds with nitric acid is the primary method of synthesis of many common explosives, such as nitroglycerin and trinitrotoluene (TNT). As very many less stable byproducts are possible, these reactions must be carefully thermally controlled, and the byproducts removed to isolate the desired product.|$|E
25|$|Both of {{the amino}} analogs are {{prepared}} from the condensation of 3-aminopiperidine-2,6-dione hydrochloride (Compound 3) which is synthesized in a two step reaction from commercially available Cbz-L-glutamine. The Cbz-L-glutamine is treated with CDI in refluxing THF to yield Cbz-aminoglutarimide. To remove the Cbz protecting group hydrogenolysis, under 50–60 psi of hydrogen with 10% Pd/C mixed with ethyl acetate and HCl, was performed. The formulated hydrochloride (Compound 3 in Scheme 3) was then reacted with 3-nitrophthalic anhydride in refluxing acetic acid to yield the 4-nitro substituted thalidomide analog and the <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> then reduced with hydrogenation to give pomalidomide.|$|E
25|$|Nilutamide is a nitroaromatic {{hydantoin}} analog of flutamide, as seen {{in figure}} 5. Nilutamide is eliminated exclusively by metabolism, mainly by reduction of the aromatic <b>nitro</b> <b>group.</b> Although the hydrolysis {{of one of the}} carbonyl functions of the imidazolinedione was identified, it is much less susceptible to hepatic metabolism than the amide bond in hydroxuflutamide. This results in a longer half-life of nilutamide in humans of 2 days. Nevertheless, the nitro anion-free radical formed during nitro reduction could still be associated with hepatotoxicity in humans, especially when using relatively high dosage employed for androgen blockage. Nilutamide causes side-effects which limit its usage, such as pneumonitis and delayed adaption to darkness.|$|E

In this work a series of mono-, di-, tri- and tetra nitroderivatives was reduced, the sequence of individual steps was described and the mechanism discussed. It was found that in this molecule with several redox centers all <b>nitro</b> <b>groups</b> are electronically isolated and thus are reduced independently yielding poly-radical ions.

2500|$|In organic synthesis, {{industrial}} and otherwise, the <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> is a versatile functional group. Most derivatives of aniline are prepared via nitration of aromatic compounds followed by reduction.

50|$|FOX-7 {{is similar}} to the {{insensitive}} chemical compound TATB, which is a benzene ring compound with three amino and three <b>nitro</b> <b>groups.</b> FOX-7 has a two-carbon backbone rather than a benzene ring, but the amino and <b>nitro</b> <b>groups</b> have similar effects in both cases according to published reports on sensitivity and chemical decay processes of FOX-7. FOX-7 is today produced by Eureco Bofors AB in Sweden.|$|R
2500|$|Bicalutamide has a cyano {{group at}} the para {{position}} instead of a <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> like flutamide and nilutamide. This change in groups avoids the nitro reduction observed in nilutamide. Bicalutamide has a chiral carbon in its structure (labeled with an asterisk in figure 6), which {{is connected to the}} hydroxyl and methyl groups [...] It is therefore administered as a racemate. Post-approval investigation revealed that its antiandrogenic activity resides almost entirely in the (R)-enantiomer. (R)-bicalutamide has an almost fourfold higher affinity for the prostate AR than hydroxyflutamide and has a better side-effect profile compared to other antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|Nitro {{compounds}} are {{organic compounds}} that contain {{one or more}} nitro functional groups (−2). The <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> {{is one of the}} most common explosophores (functional group that makes a compound explosive) used globally. The <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> is also strongly electron-withdrawing. Because of this property, C−H bonds alpha (adjacent) to the <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> can be acidic. For similar reasons, the presence of nitro groups in aromatic compounds retards electrophilic aromatic substitution but facilitates nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Nitro groups are rarely found in nature, being almost invariably produced by nitration reactions starting with nitric acid.|$|E
