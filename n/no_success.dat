5|$|The British naval command was {{continually}} {{frustrated by}} the use of Machias as a staging point for militia actions in Nova Scotia. Samuel Graves ordered Sir George Collier to destroy Machias in 1777. Graves attempted to subdue Machias multiple times, but had <b>no</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|U-43s first patrol {{under her}} new {{commander}} began on 4 July 1942, as she sailed from Kiel via the 'gap' between Iceland and the Faroe Islands into the mid-Atlantic. However, she achieved <b>no</b> <b>success,</b> and arrived back at Lorient on 15 August after 43 days at sea.|$|E
5|$|U-43s next patrol, {{beginning}} on 2 August 1941, took her {{back out into}} the mid-Atlantic for 53 days, but she had <b>no</b> <b>success</b> before returning to Lorient on 23 September.|$|E
25|$|U-438 left Brest {{again on}} 31 December 1942 for another mid-Atlantic patrol, but had <b>no</b> <b>successes</b> before {{returning}} to base on 16 February.|$|R
50|$|U-625's {{next four}} patrols {{in the waters}} north of Norway, between December 1942 and June 1943, were uneventful, and she had <b>no</b> <b>successes.</b>|$|R
25|$|U-511 sailed from Lorient on 24 October 1942, and {{patrolled the}} waters {{off the coast of}} north-west Africa before {{returning}} to base after 36 days, on 28 November, having had <b>no</b> <b>successes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Brassey {{had other}} ideas which were {{ahead of his}} time. He tried to {{interest}} {{the governments of the}} United Kingdom and Europe in the idea of a tunnel under the English Channel but this came to nothing. He also wanted to build a canal through the Isthmus of Darién (now the Isthmus of Panama) but this idea similarly had <b>no</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Louis Faidherbe, the {{governor}} of Senegal, inaugurated the Bouteville boat that was capable of transporting 150 passengers, animals {{and all kinds of}} goods. The boat made ten crosses every day and the fares differed: five centimes for a person, 50 centimes for a horse, cow or camel, and two francs for a carriage. In less than a year it was obvious that this system was overrun and a second boat was introduced but with <b>no</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|Julius Epstein {{made two}} {{attempts}} {{to turn the}} film into a Broadway musical, in 1951 and 1967, but neither {{made it to the}} stage. The original play, Everybody Comes to Rick's, was produced in Newport, Rhode Island, in August 1946, and again in London in April 1991, but met with <b>no</b> <b>success.</b> The film was adapted into a musical by the Takarazuka Revue, an all-female Japanese musical theater company, and ran from November 2009 through February 2010.|$|E
25|$|U-759 first sailed from Kiel on 2 February 1943, and {{out into}} the Atlantic, south of Greenland. She had <b>no</b> <b>successes,</b> and arrived at Lorient, France on 14 March after 41 days.|$|R
50|$|In October, {{in concert}} with B-7 Escort Group, the group worked in support of ON 207. <b>No</b> <b>successes</b> were recorded, though the convoy battle saw three U-boats destroyed, with no ships lost.|$|R
50|$|U-511 sailed from Lorient on 24 October 1942, and {{patrolled the}} waters {{off the coast of}} north-west Africa before {{returning}} to base after 36 days, on 28 November, having had <b>no</b> <b>successes.</b>|$|R
5|$|U-255 left Narvik on 18 July 1942, {{arriving}} at Bergen on the 20th. She sailed from Bergen on 4 August for her second combat patrol, heading deep into Soviet waters, but had <b>no</b> <b>success,</b> although she shelled two Soviet wireless stations {{as part of}} Operation Wunderland, before {{arriving at}} Neidenfjord on the Norwegian/Finnish border on 9 September.|$|E
5|$|After the 6th U-boat Flotilla was disbanded in December 1939, U-43 was {{assigned}} to the 2nd U-boat Flotilla based in Wilhelmshaven. U-43 departed from there on 13 March 1940 and sailed along the coast of Norway, north of Scotland, and into the waters west of Ireland, but had <b>no</b> <b>success.</b> The First Watch Officer (second-in-command of the U-boat) Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Wilhelm Behrens fell overboard and was lost on 31 March. U-43 returned to Wilhelmshaven, after 25 days at sea, on 6 April.|$|E
5|$|Cancellara's {{first victory}} of the 2009 season came in the prologue of the Tour of California. This was his second victory {{in a row in}} the prologue at the Tour of California. Cancellara then {{returned}} to the Tirreno–Adriatico, but an injury prevented his efforts to repeat as winner of the event. Cancellara did not finish the sixth stage of the race; he left the event without winning a single stage. Poor performance marred the early portion of the season for Cancellara as he achieved <b>no</b> <b>success</b> in the early season classics; he did not finish the Tour of Flanders after suffering problem with his bike chain early in the race, on the Koppenberg, and he finished 49th overall in the Paris–Roubaix.|$|E
50|$|U-759 first sailed from Kiel on 2 February 1943, and {{out into}} the Atlantic, south of Greenland. She had <b>no</b> <b>successes,</b> and arrived at Lorient, France on 14 March after 41 days.|$|R
50|$|In October, on {{returning}} to the group, Starling {{was involved in the}} battle around convoy ON 207.  <b>No</b> <b>successes</b> were recorded, though the convoy battle saw three U-boats destroyed, with no ships lost.|$|R
25|$|He {{served in}} No. 15 Squadron {{throughout}} 1916, flying a B.E.2c two-seater reconnaissance aircraft, but had <b>no</b> <b>successes</b> in combat, as his unit was mainly engaged in such duties as artillery spotting and aerial photography.|$|R
5|$|In 1929, while {{studying}} mathematics at Poznań University, Rejewski attended a secret cryptology course {{conducted by the}} Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfrów), which he joined in September 1932. The Bureau had had <b>no</b> <b>success</b> in reading Enigma-enciphered messages and set Rejewski {{to work on the}} problem in late 1932; he deduced the machine's secret internal wiring after only a few weeks. Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma messages. His contributions included the cryptologic card catalog, derived using the cyclometer that he had invented, and the cryptologic bomb.|$|E
5|$|In McPherson's sector, Logan's {{division}} {{made another}} thrust down the Jackson Road at about 2 p.m., but met with heavy losses and {{the attack was}} called off. McClernand attacked again, reinforced by Quinby's division, but with <b>no</b> <b>success.</b> Union casualties were 502 killed, 2,550 wounded, and 147 missing, about evenly divided across the three corps. Confederate casualties were not reported directly, but {{are estimated to be}} under 500. Grant blamed McClernand's misleading dispatches for part of the poor results of the day, storing up another grievance against the political general who had caused him so many aggravations during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In the WNCL, Ebsary went wicketless for {{the entire}} season for the first time, conceding 127 runs at an economy rate of 4.70. She {{remained}} productive with the bat, scoring 207 runs at 25.87, making 43 and 57, her two highest scores of the season, in the double-header against Victoria. Western Australia won three of eight matches and {{did not make the}} final. Ebsary made 34 and 25 in her two T20 matches for the season, but had <b>no</b> <b>success</b> with the ball, conceding a total of 36 runs from three overs without taking a wicket.|$|E
25|$|U-340 sailed from Kiel on 29 April 1943, and {{out into}} the Atlantic to the waters {{south-east}} of Cape Farewell, Greenland, before returning to Bordeaux on 31 May, after 33 days at sea with <b>no</b> <b>successes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The RN also {{developed}} the R-class submarine, {{designed as a}} hunter-killer vessel, with a high underwater speed and sophisticated hydrophone system. These came too late to see action, however, and <b>no</b> <b>successes</b> were recorded by them.|$|R
50|$|U-340 sailed from Kiel on 29 April 1943, and {{out into}} the Atlantic to the waters {{south-east}} of Cape Farewell, Greenland, before returning to Bordeaux on 31 May, after 33 days at sea with <b>no</b> <b>successes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile in Scranton, {{the office}} is left without a {{receptionist}}. Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) orders to answer the phone. With {{the rest of the}} staff similarly declining to answer the phone, Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to <b>no</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|Moore did {{not make}} any screen {{appearances}} in 2003, but returned in 2004 with three films. There was <b>no</b> <b>success</b> in her first two ventures of the year: Marie and Bruce, a dark comedy co-starring Matthew Broderick, {{did not get a}} cinematic release; Laws of Attraction followed, where she played opposite Pierce Brosnan in a courtroom-based romantic comedy, but the film was panned by critics. Commercial success returned to Moore with The Forgotten, a psychological thriller in which she played a mother who is told her dead son never existed. Although the film was unpopular with critics, it opened as the US box office number one.|$|E
5|$|On January 2, 2007, {{the author}} posted the 1.0 {{version of the}} BackupHDDVD utility, which {{included}} support for the decoding of discs using volume keys. For several weeks following the utility's release <b>no</b> <b>success</b> using the author's key extraction technique was reported. In mid-January 2007, a volume key was published by {{another member of the}} Doom9 forum along with an explanation of the technique used to obtain it. Other forum members quickly discovered keys for different titles. Keys for many discs are now readily available on the internet.|$|E
5000|$|In medicine, {{the rule}} of three is used to provide a simple way of stating an {{approximate}} 95% confidence interval for p, in the special case that <b>no</b> <b>successes</b> (...) have been observed. The interval is (0,3/n).|$|R
5|$|U-853 {{operated}} {{this time}} in the Western Approaches off the British Isles, but in a period of seven weeks scored <b>no</b> <b>successes.</b> On completion she did not return to Lorient, but continued to Flensburg, arriving 14 October.|$|R
25|$|U-333s next patrol was uneventful. Departing La Pallice on 11 August 1942, {{she joined}} wolfpack 'Blücher' {{north-east}} of the Azores from 14–18 August, but had <b>no</b> <b>successes,</b> {{and returned to}} port on 24 August after only 14 days at sea.|$|R
5|$|P. rebeli live in {{different}} habitats; therefore, {{they do not}} parasitize the same Myrmica ant species. Through observation and experimentation, researchers found that if P. rebeli try to parasitize a different Myrmica ant species than the one they normally do, the Myrmica ants will identify the P. rebeli larvae as intruders and will kill 100% of the P. rebeli larvae. The differences between the P. rebeli are that they synthesize different hydrocarbons, which allow them to mimic different species of Myrmica ants. This explains why they have <b>no</b> <b>success</b> in being mistaken for another species of Myrmica ant and the ensuing 100% mortality rate when the other Myrmica ant species is not fooled.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{victory at}} Salamis ended the {{immediate}} threat to Greece, and Xerxes now returned to Asia {{with part of}} the army, leaving his general Mardonius to attempt to complete the conquest. Mardonius wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly, and the Athenians were thus {{able to return to}} their city, which had been burnt and razed by the Persians, for the winter. For the Athenians, and Themistocles personally, the winter would be a testing one. The Peloponnesians refused to countenance marching north of the Isthmus to fight the Persian army; the Athenians tried to shame them into doing so, with <b>no</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{police had}} only two clues: some {{footprints}} in the garden, and a hat that they found in a nearby gutter. The police took moulds of the footprints and endeavored to trace the hat, but with <b>no</b> <b>success.</b> However, during routine questioning of local residents, police learned that earlier in {{the afternoon of the}} murder, a man had been seen sitting with a heavily-pregnant young woman on a bench at one end of South Cliff Avenue; the man had also been seen wandering the street while the young woman sat on the bench alone, leading police to suspect that the man was assessing the lay of the land.|$|E
50|$|The 4x4 Duro {{was also}} {{offered as a}} {{commercial}} vehicle for communities and municipalities as dump trucks or with solid aluminum construction as service vehicles, {{but there were no}} significant sales. Also in the configuration as a civilian ambulance, there were <b>no</b> <b>successes.</b>|$|R
25|$|U-539 {{departed}} Lorient on 2 January 1944, as {{the first}} U-boat to sail on combat patrol equipped with the Schnorchel breathing device. She sailed across the Atlantic to the waters south of Newfoundland, but had <b>no</b> <b>successes.</b> She returned to Saint-Nazaire on 21 March.|$|R
25|$|Operating {{as part of}} the Monsun Gruppe U-510 {{sailed to}} Singapore and then to Kobe, Japan, before {{returning}} to Batavia (now Jakarta). From there, on 26 November 1944, she sailed on her only combat patrol, returning to Batavia on 3 December having had <b>no</b> <b>successes.</b>|$|R
