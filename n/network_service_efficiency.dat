40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a joint load balancing and hotspot mitigation protocol for mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) termed by us as 'load_energy balance + hotspot mitigation protocol (LEB+HM) '. We argue that although ad-hoc wireless networks have limited network resources - bandwidth and power, prone to frequent link/node failures and have high security risk; existing ad hoc routing protocols {{do not put}} emphasis on maintaining robust link/node, efficient use of network resources and on maintaining {{the security of the}} network. Typical route selection metrics used by existing ad hoc routing protocols are shortest hop, shortest delay, and loop avoidance. These routing philosophy have the tendency to cause traffic concentration on certain regions or nodes, leading to heavy contention, congestion and resource exhaustion which in turn may result in increased end-to-end delay, packet loss and faster battery power depletion, degrading the overall performance of the network. Also in most existing on-demand ad hoc routing protocols intermediate nodes are allowed to send route reply RREP to source in response to a route request RREQ. In such situation a malicious node can send a false optimal route to the source so that data packets sent will be directed to or through it, and tamper with them as wish. It is therefore desirable to adopt routing schemes which can dynamically disperse traffic load, able to detect and remove any possible bottlenecks and provide some form of security to the network. In this paper we propose a combine adaptive load_energy balancing and hotspot mitigation scheme that aims at evenly distributing network traffic load and energy, mitigate against any possible occurrence of hotspot and provide some form of security to the network. This combine approach is expected to yield high reliability, availability and robustness, that best suits any dynamic and scalable ad hoc network environment. Dynamic source routing (DSR) was use as our underlying protocol for the implementation of our algorithm. Simulation comparison of our protocol to that of original DSR shows that our protocol has reduced node/link failure, even distribution of battery energy, and better <b>network</b> <b>service</b> <b>efficiency...</b>|$|E

To enable {{the integration of}} programmable networks and active networking an object-oriented, distributed approach based on Object Request Broker (ORB) technology is presented. A Distributed Processing Environment (DPE) is described as an interoperable service platform, for dynamic and secure service provisioning support. As a platform service, a resource control framework adaptively manages router resource allocation, provides virtual resource abstraction and dynamic partitioning, to achieve the goal of scalable and secure active networking. As an example of active services, advanced reservation is developed and measured to evaluate the performance of object-oriented implementation of <b>network</b> <b>services</b> and the <b>efficiency</b> of underlying resource control paradigm.

40|$|Health {{maintenance}} organizations (HMOs) have intensified {{their efforts to}} establish network-like structures with service partners {{who are responsible for}} different functions along the health value chain. To calculate the potential value and cost benefits of ser-vice production within health care networks and to improve performance in such networks, the authors propose a two-step benchmarking approach. While the first step is concerned with measuring and comparing service provider performance, the second step relates to a contact program that disseminates the lessons learned during the benchmarking process. Across two empirical studies with general practitioners and specialty physicians, the authors identify in a first step tremendous overspendings and provide suggestions on cost reductions that could be achieved without threatening output levels. With regard to the second step, the authors find that detailing efforts {{based on the results of}} performance measurement helped physicians to improve their performance. Through detailing, the hub was able to inform network partners about the benchmarking results and to reveal per-formance gaps in their current resource utilization patterns. In addition, the authors show that managers of HMOs should seek out physicians with smaller practices and high-referral (i. e., risk-averse) physicians as targets for detailing, who are especially responsive to these initiatives.

40|$|AbstractDecisions {{to locate}} {{facilities}} within product-service network should satisfy all stakeholders’ objective in supply chains. To provide solutions for such strategic decisions, many method and approaches {{have been applied}} including operations research, fuzzy decision making, etc. Reviewing the efficient and effective methods, agent-based models (ABM) are proved to provide competitive solutions to distributed problems. In this paper an agent-based model for the facility location problems is presented. Agents are defined as regional warehouses and cities; optimization rules are applied to the behavior of agents in distribution-service network environment. Agents make decision on the location of facilities based on autonomy factors and Optimization rules which are derived from similar optimization problems in facility location. Proposed model is implemented to a case in automobile after sales <b>services</b> <b>network.</b> The <b>efficiency</b> of proposed model is evaluated by defined performance measures under demand uncertainty.

40|$|The {{automated}} {{identification of}} <b>network</b> <b>service</b> depen-dencies remains a challenging {{problem in the}} administra-tion of large distributed systems. Advances in developing solutions for this problem have immediate and tangible benefits to operators in the field. When the dependencies of the <b>services</b> in a <b>network</b> are better-understood, plan-ning for and responding to system failures becomes more efficient, minimizing downtime and managing resources more effectively. This paper introduces three novel techniques {{to assist in the}} automatic identification of <b>network</b> <b>service</b> depen-dencies through passively monitoring and analyzing net-work traffic, including a logarithm-based ranking scheme aimed at more accurate detection of <b>network</b> <b>service</b> de-pendencies with lower false positives, an inference tech-nique for identifying the dependencies involving infre-quently used <b>network</b> <b>services,</b> and an approach for au-tomated discovery of clusters of <b>network</b> <b>services</b> config-ured for load balancing or backup purposes.

40|$|This paper aims at {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> evolution through a closer examination of the context of mobile handsets. It aims first to establish quantitatively that mobile handsets are a determinant of mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> evolution patterns, and second, to develop a consistent perspective capable of explaining the evolution of various mobile <b>network</b> <b>services.</b> Despite the fact that mobile handsets are indispensable to users of mobile <b>network</b> <b>services,</b> surprisingly little is known about the role of these handsets in mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> evolution. This paper provides quantitative evidence of a positive relationship between intra-network-carrier penetration rates for mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> subscribers and mobile handsets designed for these services. The relationship is such that if one <b>network</b> <b>service</b> is diffused more than another, the mobile handsets related to the more diffused service are similarly more widely diffused in the market, and vice versa. The evidence is derived from an analysis of two mobile <b>network</b> <b>services</b> in Japan, mobile Internet and third generation mobile, initiated by NTT DoCoMo and KDDI. There are no existing studies that consistently explain the mechanisms of different mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> evolution patterns. Since the positive relationship that emerges from the analysis is consistent for both cases, by examining the mechanisms underlying this relationship, the paper develops an adequate and consistent perspective based on a constituent model reflecting the technological and competition structure of mobile <b>network</b> <b>services.</b> From this perspective, this positive relationship can be explained as the similarity or dissimilarity in essential technology ownership distribution across constituents. This perspective describes mobile network evolution in terms of changes in the distribution of essential technology ownership and, therefore, could be generalised more widely.
