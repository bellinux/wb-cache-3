5|$|Architecturally, most war {{memorials}} {{were relatively}} conservative in design, aiming to use established styles {{to produce a}} tragic but comforting, <b>noble</b> <b>and</b> enduring commemoration of the war dead.

Allegorical and symbolic features, frequently drawing on Christian imagery, were used to communicate themes of self-sacrifice, victory and death. Some memorials adopted a medievalist theme instead, looking backwards to a more secure past, while others used emerging realist and Art Deco architectural styles to communicate the themes of the war.|$|E

The Jesuit educational programs and Counter-Reformation propaganda utilized many innovative media techniques, often custom-tailored for a particular audience on hand, as well as time-tried methods of humanist instruction. Preacher Piotr Skarga and Bible translator Jakub Wujek count among prominent Jesuit personalities.|$|E
