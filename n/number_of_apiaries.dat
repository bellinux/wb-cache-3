40|$|Sustaining {{apiculture}} worldwide {{has been}} threatened by bee diseases and unexplained colony losses. African honeybee populations seem healthier and no major losses {{have been reported}} {{despite the presence of}} all the major pests and diseases. The scattered colonies in the large wild population of the continent might ensure slow pathogen spread and thus protect the unmanaged colonies in comparison with the concentration of colonies in managed apiaries. Beekeeping and trade in bee products is responsible for spreading many diseases throughout the world. The recent outbreak of the bacterial disease American foulbrood (AFB) in South Africa is a matter of great concern. Despite a growing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>apiaries</b> testing positive for AFB, no major colony losses have been reported yet. This could be based on higher disease resistance of African honeybees, but such a trait might not persist if pathogens accumulate in the hives. In {{the first part of this}} article we review what is known on the history, biology and epidemiology of AFB as well as the control methods available. We then argue that given the particular context of honeybees in Africa, protection policies need to be put in place to ensure that African honeybees remain healthy. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Different {{episodes of}} mortalities of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies have been {{associated}} with the presence of honey bee pathogens. Since the Biobío Region has among the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>apiaries</b> in Chile, the aim {{of the present study was}} to identify viruses in the Region affecting honey bees, evaluate their relation to other pathogens, and conduct a phylogenetic analysis. Pupae and adult bees were collected from 60 apiaries of Apis mellifera L. in the Biobío Region over 2 yr. RNA viruses were detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and Acarapis woodi, Nosema spp., and Varroa destructor via PCR. Three viruses were detected: Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV) and Deformed wing virus (DWV) in 2 %, 10 %, and 42 % of the apiaries, respectively. No statistical correlation was observed between the presence of the different viruses, V. destructor, A. woodi, and the two Nosema species, and the bee development stages. One year after the first sampling, DWV and BQCV were detected mainly in foraging adult bee samples. Three percent of the apiaries were infected with N. apis and 18 % with N. ceranae, 5 % were positive for V. destructor, while A. woodi was not detected. PCR products were sequenced and compared to the Genbank database. Chilean sequences of ABPV, BQCV, and DWV showed high percentages of similarity to other isolates in South America...|$|E
40|$|Beekeepers {{suspected}} maize, Zea mays L., {{treated with}} imidacloprid {{to result in}} substantial loss of honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colonies in Belgium. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the potential impact of maize grown from imidacloprid-treated seeds on honey bee mortality. A survey <b>of</b> 16 <b>apiaries</b> was carried out, and all maize fields treated or not with imidacloprid were located within a radius of 3, 000 m around the observed <b>apiaries.</b> Samples <b>of</b> honey, beeswax, and bees were collected in three colonies per apiary and analyzed for pesticide contain by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We first found a significant correlation between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> colonies per <b>apiary</b> and the mortality rates in an apiary. In addition, this mortality rate was inversely correlated with the surface of maize fields treated and not with imidacloprid, suggesting that this pesticide do not interact with bees' fitness. Moreover, a very large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> our samples contained acaricides either prohibited or ineffective against Varroa destructor (Anderson & Trueman) (Acari: Varroidae), suggesting that the treatment methods used by the beekeepers to be inadequate for mite control.

40|$|Varroadestructor is an {{invasive}} {{alien species}} that has been reported parasitizing the endemic honey bee of Madagascar, Apis mellifera unicolor, since 2010. Studying its nuclear genetic diversity and structure was our main goal. Using 11 microsatellite loci and 344 mites collected from 12 apiaries, we observed a low genetic diversity, with only 8 multilocus genotypes (MLG) identified. V. destructor populations form a single genetic cluster, clonal richness ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 20, and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> MLG within <b>apiaries</b> varied between one and six MLGs. About 69. 5 % of the mites analyzed harbored the same genotype (100 %, homozygous), and 23. 3 % had a genotype differing by a single allele. The overall low diversity observed suggests one or multiple introductions of similar genotypes. The greater abundance of MLGs in High Land apiaries (eight MLGs) than {{on the east coast}} (two MLGs) and the presence of particular MLGs in High Land apiaries favor the hypothesis that V. destructor has been first introduced close to the international airport, and then spread to other regions by commercial exchanges.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} six apiaries {{in several}} natural environments with a Mediterranean ecosystem in Madrid, central Spain, {{in order to}} understand how landscape and management characteristics may influence apiary health and bee production in the long term. We focused on five criteria (habitat quality, landscape heterogeneity, climate, management and health), as well as 30 subcriteria, and we used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to rank them according to relevance. Habitat quality proved to have the highest relevance, followed by beehive management. Within habitat quality, the following subcriteria proved to be most relevant: orographic diversity, elevation range and important plant species located 1. 5 km from the apiary. The most important subcriteria under beehive management were honey production, movement <b>of</b> the <b>apiary</b> to a location with a higher altitude and wax renewal. Temperature was the most important subcriterion under climate, while pathogen and Varroa loads were the most significant under health. Two <b>of</b> the six <b>apiaries</b> showed the best values in the AHP analysis and showed annual honey production of 70 and 28 kg/colony. This high productivity was due primarily to high elevation range and high orographic diversity, which favored high habitat quality. In addition, one <b>of</b> these <b>apiaries</b> showed the best value for beehive management, while the other showed the best value for health, reflected in the low pathogen load and low average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> viruses.

Hornets were observed as most serious natural enemies of both house and field honeybees. Among four species of hornets viz: Vespa velutina Smith, Vespa tropica L., Vespa mandarina Smith, Vespa basalis Smith, V. velutina and V. mandarina were found to be the most abundant and serious enemies <b>of</b> honeybees in <b>apiary</b> conditions. A series of experiments were carried out to find out the efficacy of different baits for the management of hornets. Among them, the baits of rotten fish and pear attracted the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> hornets followed by rotten chicken bait. At apiary 'A' the highest <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> hornets attracted were 8. 600 and 8. 667 per five minutes during September at rotten fish and pear baits respectively. Similarly, at apiary 'B' the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> hornets attracted by rotten fish and pear were 8. 533 in September and 6. 952 in August respectively. On the other hand, the experiment on efficacy of these baits to trap foraging honeybees showed that rotten fish and pear attracted the lowest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> honeybees as compared {{to the rest of the}} baits.

40|$|Beekeeping is a {{traditionally}} well-established household activity {{in almost all}} parts of Ethiopia. However, the benefit from the sub sector is not satisfactory compared to the existing potential. The objective {{of this study is}} conducted to identify the constraints of honey production in beekeeping cooperatives in Tigray Region, Killite Awlalo Woreda. Specifically, the study examined the social, environmental, and administrative constraints of these BKCs. The research design was survey type which incorporates 160 participants including 80 members and 80 nonmembers. Data collected for this study was processed using SPSS software and analyzed using descriptive statistics. As a result the Beekeeping cooperatives internal constraints which were identified by this study includes; lack of transparency, poor members participation controlling mechanism, limited capacity of BoD and lack of working capital. In addition, the study identified those constraints such as; honey bee pest attack, drought problems, distant location <b>of</b> <b>apiary</b> sites and increased price of beekeeping inputs as an external problems. Even if the BCKs do have a great potential to increase the honey productivity, due to the existence of these constraints, they didn’t bring significant progress yet in the study area. To minimize the impact of their internal constraints, BKCs are expected to enhance transparency and accountability. In addition BKCs are expected to strengthen their members’ equivalent participation together with its controlling mechanism to enhance the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> members which actually contributes for the increased honey productivity. As lack of working capital {{is also one of the}} problems of BKCs, they are expected to effectively mobilize members for additional share capital contribution. Due to distant location <b>of</b> <b>apiary</b> sites <b>of</b> BKCS at distant closure areas, their beehives are easily exposed for honey bee pests attack. Therefore, the day to day bee colony management work is expected from members to prevent the honey product decreased due to pest attack. Finally, to develop better bargaining power in the market, BKCs are expected to jointly collect, process and pack their better quality honey product. If integrated corrective actions are taken on these identified constraints of BKCs by members and stake holders, BKCs will play significant role on honey production and productivity in the study area...|$|R
