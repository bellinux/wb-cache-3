5|$|Switzerland made {{detailed}} {{plans to}} acquire and test nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Less {{than two weeks}} after the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Swiss government started studying the possibility of building nuclear weapons, and continued its military nuclear program for 43 years until 1988. It has since signed and ratified the Treaty on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Weapons.</b> Switzerland never possessed biological or chemical weapons.|$|E

After signing the treaty, Switzerland's policy of pursuing acquiring nuclear weapons was replaced by one of studying acquisition to provide options in case the treaty broke down. Switzerland ratified the treaty on 9 March 1977. Soon after that, Switzerland ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty.|$|E
5|$|The PTBT was a {{first of}} a series of nuclear arms control {{treaties}} in the second half of 20th century. The PTBT has been considered the stepping stone to the Treaty on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Weapons</b> (NPT) of 1968, which made explicit reference to the progress provided by the PTBT. In addition to the NPT, the PTBT was followed within ten years by the Outer Space Treaty and Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1967, Seabed Arms Control Treaty in 1971, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972. In 1974, the Threshold Test Ban Treaty prohibited underground tests with yields above 150 kilotons.|$|E

The five nuclear-weapon states, who also happen to be the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, have been {{for the last six years}} in a relationship other than acute political hostility, and their need for such weapons for their own security is no longer so self-evident as it was prior to 1991.

5|$|The 1972–73 {{debate over}} French nuclear {{testing in the}} Pacific mobilised several groups, {{including}} some trade unions. In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Weapons,</b> and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} Cold War, NATO's watch {{against the}} Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact did not {{actually}} lead to direct military action. On 1July 1968, the Treaty on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Weapons</b> opened for signature: NATO argued that its nuclear sharing arrangements did not breach the treaty as US forces controlled the weapons until {{a decision was made}} to go to war, at which point the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements at that time, and they were not challenged. In May 1978, NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance, to maintain security and pursue détente. This was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further arms race.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{increasing}} role on {{the world}} stage strained his relationship with the USSR, now under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev. Asserting Cuba's independence, Castro refused to sign the Treaty on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Weapons,</b> declaring it a Soviet-U.S. attempt to dominate the Third World. Diverting from Soviet Marxist doctrine, he suggested that Cuban society could evolve straight to pure communism rather than gradually progress through various stages of socialism. In turn, the Soviet-loyalist Aníbal Escalante began organizing a government network of opposition to Castro, though in January 1968, he and his supporters were arrested for allegedly passing state secrets to Moscow. However, recognising Cuba's economic dependence on the Soviets, Castro relented to Brezhnev's pressure to be obedient, and in August 1968 he denounced the leaders of the Prague Spring and praised the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Influenced by China's Great Leap Forward, in 1968 Castro proclaimed a Great Revolutionary Offensive, closing all remaining privately owned shops and businesses and denouncing their owners as capitalist counter-revolutionaries. The severe lack of consumer goods for purchase led productivity to decline, as large sectors of the population felt little incentive to work hard. This was exacerbated by the perception that a revolutionary elite had emerged consisting of those connected to the administration; they had access to better housing, private transportation, servants, and the ability to purchase luxury goods abroad.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objections}} raised against total elimination <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> {{are built}} around a few arguments mostly <b>of</b> non-technical nature. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> and the strategies for their use {{have resulted in the}} establishment of a vicious circle within which the international community is trapped. The argument that the world will be unsafe without <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> is only meant to further the narrow self-interest <b>of</b> the <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> states and their allies. The World Court’s far-reaching 1996 advisory opinion concluded that almost any use or threat <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> would violate international humanitarian law and law applicable in armed conflict, undermining most claims <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> states regarding the legitimacy of possession, use or threat <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> The next logical step would be an initiative for a nuclear convention banning the use and threat <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in Asia and the adjoining oceans. But as long as the dominant elites in society and the nation-state believe in the utility <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> for national security or as the currency of power, abolition <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> will remain a mirage...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{argues that}} {{customary}} international law does not prohibit the use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in self-defense. Part I describes the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> including their destructive capabilities and health effects. Part I also discusses {{the development of the}} laws of war and the process by which a generally accepted principle or practice ascends to {{customary international law}}. Further, Part I presents existing treaties concerning non-proliferation and other nuclear weapons-related issues. Part II examines the application of the laws <b>of</b> war to <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> use and the resulting conflict over the legality of the use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> Part III argues that the international community has neither expressly consented to nor evidenced their intent to accept a ban on <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> use. Customary international law, therefore, does not contain a rule forbidding the use <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in all circumstances. This Note concludes that prospective measures designed to deter the use and proliferation <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> are more effective than a decision determining the legality <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons...</b>|$|R
