5|$|The {{route map}} shows the {{navigation}} in deep blue, (or green for the drained section), to {{distinguish it from}} the river, shown in light blue. Deep blue is <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> to represent navigable waterways, but is used here for clarity.|$|E
5|$|Chromic acid {{anodizing}} (or Type I anodizing) {{of aluminium}} is another electrochemical process, {{which does not}} lead to the deposition of chromium, but uses chromic acid as electrolyte in the solution. During anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium. The use of chromic acid, instead of the <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> sulfuric acid, leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers.|$|E
5|$|Gritters {{are among}} the winter service {{vehicles}} also used in airports, to keep runways free of ice. However, the salt <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> to clear roads can damage the airframe of aircraft and interferes with the sensitive navigation equipment. As a result, airport gritters spread less dangerous potassium acetate or urea onto the runways instead, as these do not corrode the aircraft or the airside equipment.|$|E

5|$|Organobromides are {{typically}} produced by additive or substitutive bromination of other organic precursors. Bromine {{itself can be}} used, but due to its toxicity and volatility safer brominating reagents are <b>normally</b> <b>used,</b> such as N-bromosuccinimide. The principal reactions for organobromides include dehydrobromination, Grignard reactions, reductive coupling, and nucleophilic substitution.|$|E
5|$|Several Listeria and Shigella species move inside host cells by usurping the cytoskeleton, {{which is}} <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> to move organelles inside the cell. By {{promoting}} actin polymerisation at one pole of their cells, they can form {{a kind of}} tail that pushes them through the host cell's cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|The Vallée Blanche Cable Car is <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> by {{visitors}} travelling {{from one}} or other of the tourist centres of Chamonix or Courmayeur and gives views over the glaciated regions of the massif. It crosses the massif in a roughly north – south direction and connects the Aiguille du Midi with the Point Helbronner, each of which can themselves be reached by téléphérique from Chamonix and Courmayeur, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{demanded a}} {{different}} approach to directing than a usual The Simpsons episode. Director Neil Affleck had to animate each segment so that it fit the style of the show it parodied. The Love-matic Grampa segment for instance emulates a three camera setup, as is <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> in sitcoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Home Movies co-creator Brendon Small, and was the final episode of the series' {{production}} run. The episode was the fifty-second of the series, a number that allows for an even distribution of reruns of the series; Small noted that the technique is <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> on animated children's shows, though Home Movies is actually created for an adult audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} {{negative}} real numbers {{are not always}} defined and are discontinuous even where defined. In fact, they are only defined when the exponent is a rational number with the denominator being an odd integer. When dealing with complex numbers the complex number operation is <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> instead.|$|E

25|$|Solutions to {{interchangeability}} {{problems of}} transshipment are bogie exchange between cars, a rollbock system, variable gauge, dual gauge, or even gauge conversion. European standard gauge trains <b>normally</b> <b>use</b> buffers and chain couplers, {{which do not}} allow such tight curves, a main reason to have narrow gauge. Therefore, narrow-gauge trains <b>normally</b> <b>use</b> other couplers, which makes bogie exchange meaningless.|$|R
5|$|The {{wood of the}} bending part of {{the limb}} ("dustar") must endure intense {{shearing}} stress, and denser woods such as hard maples are <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> in Turkish bows. Bamboo, and wood of the mulberry family, are traditional in China. Some composite bows have nonbending tips ("siyahs"), which need to be stiff and light; they may be made of woods such as Sitka spruce.|$|E
5|$|These {{facts are}} {{obscured}} by the omission of the solvent from the expression that is <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> to define pKa, but pKa values obtained in a given mixed solvent {{can be compared to}} each other, giving relative acid strengths. The same is true of pKa values obtained in a particular non-aqueous solvent such a DMSO.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the {{national}} flag is reserved to serve either informative of festive purposes. A single specimen {{of the flag}} on or {{in front of a}} public office building indicates its official role. Multiple flags, on the other hand, are <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> to decorate both public and private buildings to mark special occasions, such as national holidays.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the three}} routes that operate in part over Glattalbahn tracks, routes 10 and 12 are {{operated}} by the VBZ {{on behalf of the}} Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal (VBG), <b>normally</b> <b>using</b> tramcars in the VBG's own predominantly white colour scheme, whilst route 11 is {{operated by the}} VBZ on its own behalf, <b>normally</b> <b>using</b> vehicles in its own livery.|$|R
50|$|Routes 10 and 12 are {{operated}} by the VBZ {{on behalf of the}} VBG, <b>normally</b> <b>using</b> low floor Cobra tramcars in the VBG's own predominantly white colour scheme.

5|$|While {{they are}} {{expensive}} pieces of equipment, their popularity and adoption by firefighters in the United States is increasing markedly {{due to the}} increased availability of government equipment grants following the September 11 attacks in 2001. Thermal imaging cameras pick up body heat, and they are <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> in cases where people are trapped where rescuers cannot find them.|$|E
5|$|Although NFL rules {{generally}} require {{wide receivers}} to wear jersey {{numbers in the}} 10-19 and 80-89 range, players who later change positions are allowed to keep their previous number, {{as long as it}} is not within the 50-79 range for eligible receiver purposes. Hester was allowed to keep number 23, a number <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> for cornerbacks, since it sits outside the 50-79 range. Along with former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Dwight Stone, who wore number 20 during his eight-year stint in Pittsburgh, Hester was one of two wide receivers to wear a 20's jersey number since the NFL adopted the current uniform numbering system in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is <b>normally</b> <b>used,</b> though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E
5000|$|Plants {{which are}} able to switch between {{different}} methods of carbon fixation include Portulacaria afra, better known as Dwarf Jade Plant, which <b>normally</b> <b>uses</b> C3 fixation but can use CAM if it is drought-stressed, and Portulaca oleracea, better known as Purslane, which <b>normally</b> <b>uses</b> [...] fixation but is also able to switch to CAM when drought-stressed.|$|R

5|$|Luke's face {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This is reinforced by the fact that Luke is shown drawing in silverpoint on white paper; an extremely difficult medium that demands high concentration, and is <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> only for preparation. The artist is boldly emphasising his ability and skill with preparatory sketches; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden, now in the Louvre, contains a female head very similar to Mary's in the Boston panel.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 1963, Altgens was {{scheduled}} {{to work in the}} AP offices in Dallas as the wirephoto editor. He asked instead to go to the railroad overpass (the bridge under which Elm, Main and Commerce Streets converge at the west end of Dealey Plaza) to photograph the motorcade that was to take President Kennedy from Love Field to his scheduled appearance at the Dallas Trade Mart. Altgens was not assigned to work in the field that day, so he took his personal single-lens reflex camera rather than the motor-driven equipment <b>normally</b> <b>used</b> for news events.|$|E
5|$|The {{blast furnace}} {{used at the}} Nyrstar Port Pirie lead smelter differs from most other lead blast {{furnaces}} in {{that it has a}} double row of tuyeres rather than the single row <b>normally</b> <b>used.</b> The lower shaft of the furnace has a chair shape with {{the lower part of the}} shaft being narrower than the upper. The lower row of tuyeres being located in the narrow part of the shaft. This allows the upper part of the shaft to be wider than the standard.|$|E
