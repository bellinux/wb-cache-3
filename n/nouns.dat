5|$|English <b>nouns</b> {{are only}} inflected for number and possession. New <b>nouns</b> can be formed through {{derivation}} or compounding. They are semantically divided into proper <b>nouns</b> (names) and common <b>nouns.</b> Common <b>nouns</b> are in turn divided into concrete and abstract <b>nouns,</b> and grammatically into count <b>nouns</b> and mass <b>nouns.</b>|$|E
5|$|Classifying {{particles}} are used after numerals, {{but are not}} always obligatory {{as they are in}} Thai or Chinese, for example, and are often dropped in colloquial speech. Khmer <b>nouns</b> are divided into two groups: mass <b>nouns,</b> those which take classifiers, and specific <b>nouns,</b> which do not. The overwhelming majority are mass <b>nouns.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nahuatl {{distinguishes between}} possessed and unpossessed forms of <b>nouns.</b> The absolutive suffix {{is not used}} on possessed <b>nouns.</b> In all dialects, possessed <b>nouns</b> take a prefix agreeing with number and person of its possessor. Possessed plural <b>nouns</b> take the ending -.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the process of}} transforming <b>noun</b> phrase structure form into a list of suitable heuristic used for detecting compound <b>noun</b> word in Malay sentence. The heuristic is used to obtain the syntax sentence structure for finding a compound <b>noun</b> pair of words in Malay sentence. To obtain the list of these rules, the <b>noun</b> phrase structure form must be created first, so that we know {{the possibility of the}} words' combination as a compound <b>noun.</b> The <b>noun</b> phrase structure form is grouped based on three different <b>noun</b> categories, such as i) <b>noun</b> and <b>noun</b> ii) <b>noun</b> and <b>noun</b> modifier, and iii) <b>noun</b> and non-noun modifier. However, in our research work, we focus on the category of <b>noun</b> and <b>noun</b> modifier. The heuristic rules and <b>noun</b> phrase structure form are important to understand because they help to clarify the concept of finding compound <b>noun</b> pair of words in Malay sentence. This compound <b>noun</b> output will use an input in our next research named head modifier detector...|$|R
5000|$|In grammar, a <b>noun</b> adjunct or attributive <b>noun</b> or <b>noun</b> (pre)modifier is an {{optional}} <b>noun</b> that modifies another noun; it is a <b>noun</b> {{functioning as a}} pre-modifier in a <b>noun</b> phrase. For example, in the phrase [...] "chicken soup" [...] the <b>noun</b> adjunct [...] "chicken" [...] modifies the <b>noun</b> [...] "soup". It is irrelevant whether the resulting compound <b>noun</b> is spelled {{in one or two}} parts. [...] "Field" [...] is a <b>noun</b> adjunct in both [...] "field player" [...] and [...] "fieldhouse".|$|R
50|$|First, {{similar to}} the better-studied ang-marking in Tagalog, the {{language}} also employs a case-marking reserved for the <b>noun</b> with which the verb agrees (via focus/voice morphology). This marker exhibits allomorphy {{depending on whether the}} <b>noun</b> is a proper <b>noun</b> or a common <b>noun.</b> Si is the allomorph used when the <b>noun</b> is a proper <b>noun</b> or a kinship term; ka is used when the <b>noun</b> is a common <b>noun</b> or a possessive <b>noun</b> phrase.|$|R
5|$|Compounding of noun {{roots to}} form new <b>nouns</b> is commonplace; {{there are also}} many {{morphological}} processes to derive <b>nouns</b> from verbs. Verbs also admit highly productive derivational affixes of several kinds, most of which specify transitivity or voice.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic distinguishes three open word classes: <b>nouns,</b> verbs and particles. Verbs inflect for {{person and}} number of subject and object {{as well as for}} mood. <b>Nouns</b> inflect for {{possession}} and for case. Particles do not inflect.|$|E
5|$|Most count <b>nouns</b> are inflected for plural number {{through the}} use of the plural suffix -s, but a few <b>nouns</b> have {{irregular}} plural forms. Mass <b>nouns</b> can only be pluralised {{through the use}} of a count noun classifier, e.g. one loaf of bread, two loaves of bread.|$|E

Department of Japanese Studies of Faculty of Humanities Diponegoro University. The first advisor is Drs. M. Hermintoyo, M. Pd. The second advisor is Reny Wiyatasari, S. S., M. Hum. This study {{examines}} about structure and meaning from using of the <b>noun</b> Kibou, Negai and Nozomi. Then also determines whether the <b>noun</b> Kibou, Negai and Nozomi can be substitued each other or not. Based on the analysis perfomed, the writer findout that <b>noun</b> of Kibou with meaning ‘Harapan Menjadi Kenyataan” can be replace with the <b>noun</b> of Negai and Nozomi. The <b>noun</b> of Kibou with meaning ‘Penuh dengan Harapan’ cannot be replace with the <b>noun</b> of Negai and Nozomi. The <b>noun</b> of Kibou with meaning ‘Tidak melepaskan Harapan’ and ‘ingin memberikan harapan’ can be replace with the <b>noun</b> of Nozomi but cannot be replace with the <b>noun</b> of Negai. The <b>noun</b> of Negai with meaning ‘Harapan Terwujud’ can be replace with the <b>noun</b> of Kibou and Nozomi. The <b>noun</b> of Negai with meaning ‘Harapan’ can be replace wtih theoun of Kibou and Nozomi. The <b>noun</b> of Nozomi with meaning ‘Harapan Terwujud’ can be replace with the <b>noun</b> of Kibou and Negai.

5|$|Prefixes mark {{grammatical}} {{person on}} verbs, including first person, second person, and third person. <b>Nouns</b> use combinations of prefixes and suffixes to indicate possession. Suffixes on <b>nouns</b> mark gender, location, diminutive, pejorative, and other categories. Significant agreement patterns between <b>nouns</b> and verbs involve gender, singular and plural number, {{as well as}} obviation.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Mayan languages is {{simpler than}} that of other Mesoamerican languages, yet its morphology is still considered agglutinating and polysynthetic. Verbs are marked for aspect or tense, {{the person of the}} subject, the person of the object (in the case of transitive verbs), and for plurality of person. Possessed <b>nouns</b> are marked for person of possessor. In Mayan languages, <b>nouns</b> are not marked for case and gender is not explicitly marked. Inanimate <b>nouns</b> are not gendered, but, if necessary, the gender of animate <b>nouns</b> may be specified by the prefix.|$|E

50|$|<b>Noun</b> {{classes are}} {{typically}} marked by inflection, i.e. through bound morphemes which cannot appear {{alone in a}} sentence. Class may be marked on the <b>noun</b> itself, but will also often be marked on other constituents in the <b>noun</b> phrase or in the sentence that show agreement with the <b>noun.</b> <b>Noun</b> classifiers are always free lexical items {{that occur in the}} same <b>noun</b> phrase as the <b>noun</b> they qualify. They never form a morphological unit with the <b>noun,</b> and there is never agreement marking on the verb.|$|R

5|$|Possession can be {{expressed}} either by the possessive enclitic -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of. Historically the -s possessive {{has been used for}} animate <b>nouns,</b> whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate <b>nouns.</b> Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} the possessive {{agreement}} suffixes on <b>nouns</b> and the transitive agreement suffixes on verbs {{in a number of}} instances have similar or identical shapes has even resulted in the theory that Greenlandic has a distinction between transitive and intransitive <b>nouns,</b> parallel to the same distinction in the verbs.|$|E

5|$|Biblical Hebrew had {{a typical}} Semitic {{morphology}} with nonconcatenative morphology, arranging Semitic roots into patterns to form words. Biblical Hebrew distinguished two genders (masculine, feminine), three numbers (singular, plural, and uncommonly, dual). Verbs were marked for voice and mood, {{and had two}} conjugations which may have indicated aspect and/or tense (a matter of debate). The tense or aspect of verbs was also influenced by the conjugation , in the so-called waw-consecutive construction. Default word order was verb–subject–object, and verbs inflected for the number, gender, and person of their subject. Pronominal suffixes could be appended to verbs (to indicate object) or <b>nouns</b> (to indicate possession), and <b>nouns</b> had special construct states for use in possessive constructions.|$|E
5|$|Demonstrative pronouns {{distinguish}} between proximate and remote. When they occur independently, they inflect for number. They {{may also be}} suffixed to <b>nouns,</b> e.g. /tabardaja/ 'this pack-saddle'.|$|E
