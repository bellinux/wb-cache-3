5|$|Rockefeller {{and his son}} {{continued}} to consolidate their oil interests {{as best they could}} until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust {{in the form of a}} single holding company. Rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 and he kept his stock. At last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined oil market but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies. These included, among many others, Continental Oil, which became Conoco, <b>now</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> ConocoPhillips; Standard of Indiana, which became Amoco, <b>now</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> BP; Standard of California, which became Chevron; Standard of New Jersey, which became Esso (and later, Exxon), <b>now</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> ExxonMobil; Standard of New York, which became Mobil, <b>now</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> ExxonMobil; and Standard of Ohio, which became Sohio, <b>now</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> BP.
