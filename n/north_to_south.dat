5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from <b>north</b> <b>to</b> <b>south.</b> The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from <b>north</b> <b>to</b> <b>south</b> is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} geographical {{factors that influence}} the climate of Argentina are latitude, elevation, and distance from the sea.

Thus, temperatures decrease from <b>north</b> <b>to</b> <b>south</b> due to the differences in latitudes.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} {{seedlings}} grown from seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this coloration becomes increasingly common towards the south. The changes in shape—leaves getting narrower and more robust from <b>north</b> <b>to</b> <b>south</b> and from lowland to montane—suggest adaptations to colder weather.|$|E

The city commissioned and began a long-term project, the Iway, to move I-195 in 2007 not only for safety reasons, but also to free up land and to reunify the Jewelry District with Downcity Providence, which had been split from one another by the highway. The project was estimated to cost $610 million.|$|E

5|$|Khmer dialects, {{although}} mutually intelligible, {{are sometimes}} quite marked.

The dialects form a continuum running roughly <b>north</b> <b>to</b> <b>south.</b> Standard Cambodian Khmer is mutually intelligible with the others but a Khmer Krom speaker from Vietnam, for instance, may have great difficulty communicating with a Khmer native of Sisaket Province in Thailand.|$|E
