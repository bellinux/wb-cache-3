25|$|Many {{people with}} <b>neurologic</b> <b>disorders</b> exhibit {{uncontrollable}} episodes of laughing, crying, or both {{that are either}} exaggerated or contradictory to {{the context in which}} they occur. Where patients have significant cognitive deficits (e.g., Alzheimer's) it can be unclear whether it is true PBA as opposed to a grosser form of emotional dysregulation, but patients with intact cognition often report the symptom as disturbing. Patients report that their episodes are at best only partially amenable to voluntary control, and unless they experience a severe change of mental status, they often have insight into their problem and judge their emotional display as inappropriate and out of character. The clinical effect of PBA can be severe, with unremitting and persistent symptoms that can be disabling to patients, and may significantly affect quality of life for caregivers.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{presented}} {{a patient with}} schizophrenia and with early parallel development of neurologic symptoms. At first, symptoms were manifested by extrapyramidal syndrome due to appliance of typical neuroleptics. Therefore, therapeutic approach was diverted to implementation of atipycal antiypsychotics. Consequently patient developed orofacial diskyinesias which progrediated in unilateral choreo-atetoid movements. This followed two hospitalizations for diagnostic workup and correction of therapy. Only repeated brain MR showed moderate cortical atrophy. However, even with different therapeutic changes and approaches, {{we were not able}} to reach any significant shift neither in psychiatric nor neurologic disturbances. The resistence on pharmacologic threapy led to suspicion of parallel development of <b>neurologic</b> <b>disorder</b> in form of Huntington chorea. Still remains the question whether primary <b>neurologic</b> <b>disorder</b> provoked psychotic process or there were two separate disorders where pharmacologic intervention accelerated expansion of <b>neurologic</b> <b>disorder...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for LUTS is broad and includes various medical conditions, <b>neurologic</b> <b>disorders,</b> {{and other diseases}} of the bladder, urethra, and prostate such as bladder cancer, urinary tract infection, urethral stricture, urethral calculi (stones), chronic prostatitis, and prostate cancer. Neurogenic bladder can cause urinary retention and cause symptoms {{similar to those of}} BPH. This may occur as a result of uncoordinated contraction of the bladder muscle or impairment in the timing of bladder muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation. Notable causes of neurogenic bladder include disorders of the central nervous system such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries as well as disorders of the peripheral nervous system such as diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, and alcohol-induced nerve damage. Individuals affected by heart failure often experience nighttime awakenings to urinate due to redistribution of fluid accumulated in swollen legs.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} familiality of 15 {{clinical and}} laboratory features in {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) -affected sibpairs, and to estimate correlations with the age at SLE diagnosis in affected sibpairs and parent-offspring pairs. Methods. Concordance rates and sibling risk ratios were used as indicators of familiality for 15 manifestations of SLE. Pearson's correlations and paired t-tests were {{used to compare the}} age at SLE diagnosis in affected sibpairs and in parent-offspring pairs. Results. Increased sibling risk ratios (1. 9 - 3. 9) for thrombocytopenia, discoid rash, <b>neurologic</b> <b>disorder</b> (defined as seizure or psychosis), and hemolytic anemia were observed in 159 SLE-affected sibpairs. Among these clinical features, paired expression of hemolytic anemia plus thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia plus <b>neurologic</b> <b>disorder</b> appeared to be more frequent in 709 SLE patients than would be expected by chance (P < 0. 00001 and P < 0. 007, respectively). The ratio of the presence of both hemolytic anemia and <b>neurologic</b> <b>disorder</b> was ∼ 13 times higher in the younger affected sib than in the older affected sib (P < 0. 02). Familiality of patient age at SLE diagnosis, as observed by relative correlations, was greater in 125 affected sibpairs (r = 0. 67, P < 0. 0001) than in 37 affected parent-offspring pairs (r = 0. 47, P = 0. 003). The median ± SD age at SLE diagnosis was significantly lower in offspring (21. 5 ± 10. 1 years) than in their parents (41. 6 ± 15. 8 years) (P < 0. 0001) but was not different in sibpairs. The combined non-Caucasian sibpairs had a younger mean age at SLE diagnosis compared with Caucasian sibpairs (P = 0. 014). Conclusion. Evidence for familiality of thrombocytopenia, discoid rash, <b>neurologic</b> <b>disorder,</b> hemolytic anemia, and co-occurring <b>neurologic</b> <b>disorder</b> plus hemolytic anemia in SLE was observed in 159 affected sibpairs. Familiality of the age at SLE diagnosis in relative pairs suggests that shared genes and/or shared environmental exposures impact disease susceptibility. Shared immediate environmental triggers appear less compelling, because the average time between dates of diagnosis was 11 years in parent-offspring pairs and 7. 5 years in affected sibpairs. The significantly earlier age at disease diagnosis in offspring compared with their parents suggests that some forms of anticipation might play a role in susceptibility to SLE. Stratifying families by subphenotypes that are familial may reduce heterogeneity and facilitate identification of genetic risk factors for SLE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
