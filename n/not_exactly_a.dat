The small tin hut {{on the back of}} a tricycle is a comment on Hong Kong society, and the plight of people who sleep on the streets and who are forced to move on periodically by government officials. Costing HK$5,000 to make, the house is <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> practical solution to the homeless, but the concept was tried out on street sleepers in Sham Shui Po. In 2008, Wong created Tin Man No.11, an essay in space in the form of a metallic robot that transforms into a bed. He extended the concept by creating Famiglia Grande, a series of transformable cases. In 2009, Wong attended the Subvision Festival in Hamburg as a skyscraper.|$|E

It feels like they were shooting for a 'Momento Mori' , and wound up with a 'Zero Sum'. This episode is interesting in the information it provides, and not much else.

Farrell {{was attached to the}} role in December 2001. Mark Steven Johnson credits Joe Quesada with talking him out of using the traditional Bullseye costume for the film, and Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent as this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. Farrell had to read Frank Miller's Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye [...] "because the expression on the character's faces in the comic books, and just the way they move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I'm playing [...] he's so over-the-top that you do draw from that.

500|$|Farrell's {{supporting}} roles {{include an}} ambitious Justice Department agent opposite Tom Cruise, a potential criminal in Minority Report (2002), and the villain Bullseye in Daredevil (2003). Matt Damon was originally offered the Minority Report role, turning {{it down to}} appear in Ocean's Eleven. Farrell said [...] "he had no problem" [...] being the producer's fallback after Damon declined. Bullseye is an assassin, proud of his accuracy. Farrell was signed to the role in December 2001, although he was considered for the lead role of Matt Murdock (Daredevil) until Ben Affleck signed. Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent, since this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. He read Frank Miller's Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye [...] "because the expression on the character's faces in the comic books, and {{just the way they}} move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I'm playing...he's so over-the-top that you do draw from that.

[...] In a 1968 article written for Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that when Wilson heard these songs, [...] "he was so impressed he got on the phone and called New York, and as a result I got a more or less unlimited budget to do this monstrosity." [...] Freak Out! is an early example of the concept album, a sardonic farce about rock music and America. [...] "All the songs on it were about something", Zappa wrote in The Real Frank Zappa Book.

500|$|One Hot Minute {{was not as}} universally well {{received}} as Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and was ultimately {{considered to be a}} poor follow-up. It did however receive mixed to positive reviews from critics. Daina Darzin of Rolling Stone said [...] "One Hot Minute dives into the emotionally deep end of drug addiction and loss", and that the album [...] "is a ferociously eclectic and imaginative disc that also presents the band members as more thoughtful, spiritual—even grown-up. After a 10 plus-year career, they're realizing their potential at last." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "One Hot Minute wails and flails like a mosh-pit workout tape, but it also has moments of outright subtlety and maturity." [...] He goes on to praise Kiedis for [...] "keeping his boorish tendencies under control." [...] Browne, however, criticizes the band for [...] "attempts at cosmic philosophy which often trip up on hippie-dippie sentiments", and some songs [...] "fall back on tired frat-funk flop sweat." [...] "The Peppers work their own little patch with considerable expertise," [...] wrote Peter Kane in Q. [...] "The incoming Navarro rarely fails to deliver the goods and upfront the taut ball of energy going by the name of Anthony Kiedis still makes for a suitably rubbery-lipped frontman, if <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> lovable one." [...] Q also included One Hot Minute in its 'best of the year' roundup: [...] "A bulging, blistering blend of a skewed ballads and physically intimidating workouts that charge around like a bull on a promise." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in July 2011. DeCandido is a novelist and has produced works based in the Star Trek universe, and describes himself as [...] "the Klingon guy" [...] as far as Star Trek novelists are concerned. However, he was not overly pleased with the episode, describing the plot as being slow and saying that Michael Dorn's acting skills at this point were [...] "mediocre" [...] but would get [...] "much much better" [...] later in the series. He praised David Froman as K'Nera, describing him as having [...] "tremendous presence" [...] and thought that although Vaughn Armstrong was excellent as Admiral Forrest in Enterprise, in this early episode he was [...] "overly histrionic". He described the overhead shot of Worf after the death of Korris as [...] "just silly", and thought that the episode overall was a [...] "forgettable mess". He gave it a rating of four out of ten. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club in May 2010, thought that the first act of [...] "Heart of Glory" [...] was slow, but it improved after that and said that [...] "while it's <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> tear-jerker, it allows Worf the dignity the character needs to work." [...] He had mixed feelings about the Klingon death ritual, but felt that it was justified at the end of the episode as the complex nature of the character of Korris made the sense of loss feel earned. He gave the episode a grade of B+.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequencing}} of the record's track list was done strategically, starting with songs that lyrically depict societal injustices {{and ending with}} those that explore love, relationships and sexuality. This decision also factored into the album's artwork and marketing, giving it an overt black and white militant imagery. Jam explained that [...] "he idea of putting 'Rhythm Nation', 'Living in the World' and 'The Knowledge' as the first three songs on the record really set the tone {{as to what the}} record was. Then to have the segue after that where she says, 'Get the point? Good. Let's dance...' and then go into 'Miss You Much', that was purposely done." [...] He also stated that the safer marketing strategy for the project would have been [...] "a beautiful colored picture of Janet on the cover" [...] with Escapade as its title, starting the track listing with [...] "Miss You Much", [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)" [...] and [...] "Escapade", and ending it with [...] "Livin' in a World (They Didn't Make)", [...] "The Knowledge" [...] and [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] but noted that despite being the same collection of songs, the alternate sequencing and imagery would not have had the same impact. Of its lyrical themes, Kate Kelly stated the album [...] "reveals a social conscience speaking of getting an education, avoiding drugs, and feeding the homeless. All this might seem a little heavy for dance music or pop radio, but Jackson fuses her concepts with driving dance energy that hits the hearts of those hitting the dance-floor." [...] Andrew Barker of Variety described it as [...] "a quasi-concept album whose opening three songs directly addressed crime, the crack epidemic, racism, homelessness and youth illiteracy — <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>a</b> recipe for a party. And yet the record was somehow even more successful than Control, generating a then-record seven top 5 singles." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan Feeney of The Atlantic {{argued that}} [...] "Jealous" [...] was both {{one of the}} album's best songs and one of singer's most notable songs overall. Feeney felt that its message was interesting, {{particularly}} during the bridge, [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>an</b> apology, and it's <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>an</b> admission that she's somehow responsible for her date (Jay Z, presumably) not showing. But it is, by my count, {{only the second time}} in her solo career that Beyoncé has ever admitted that just maybe it's she who's in the wrong." [...] He went on to say that by moving away from the big and [...] "sweeping" [...] statements present in some of her older material, towards personal narration, Beyoncé managed to effectively examine the themes and statements she explored throughout her career. Feeney concluded by stating: [...] "It's not a breakup anthem, nor is it a declaration of undying love. It's angry, it's introspective, it's regretful, it's playful, it's loving, and it's everything in between." ...|$|R
