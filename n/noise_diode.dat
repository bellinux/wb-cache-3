As other scanning microwave imagers, the GMI provides primary calibration using a hot load blackbody and cold sky view. Unlike other microwave imagers, the GMI uses a secondary calibration system with noise diodes on the lower frequency channels. The noise diodes provide four calibration points, rather than just two. The dual calibration system enables on-board trending of non-linearity, as well independent cross-checking of each calibration element for stability and anomalous behavior.

The primary objectives of SWOT are to characterize ocean sub-mesoscale processes on 10 -km and larger scales in the global oceans, and to measure the global water storage in inland surface water bodies, including rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands. In this innovation, the feed provides three separate output ports in the 87 -to- 97 -GHz, 125 -to- 135 -GHz, and 161 -to- 183 - GHz bands; WR 10 for the 90 -GHz channel, WR 8 for the 130 -GHz channel, and WR 5 for the 170 -GHz channel.

End-to-end calibration of GNSS-R has been performed using well-characterized reflection surface (e. g., water), direct path antenna, and receiver gain characterization. We propose an augmented approach using on-board receiver electronics for radiometric calibration of SoOp reflectometers utilizing direct and reflected signal receiving antennas. The method calibrates receiver and correlator gains and offsets utilizing a reference switch and common noise source. On-board electronic calibration sources, such as reference switches, <b>noise</b> <b>diodes</b> and loop-back circuits, have shown great utility in stabilizing total power and correlation microwave radiometer and scatterometer receiver electronics in L-band spaceborne instruments. Application to SoOp instruments is likely to bring several benefits.

The direct path channel is analogous to the loopback path in a scatterometer to provide a reference of the transmitted power, although the receiver is independent from the reflected path channel. Thus, a common noise source {{can be used to}} measure the gain ratio of the two paths. Using these techniques long-term (days to weeks) calibration stability of spaceborne L-band scatterometer and radiometer has been achieved better than 0. 1.

Both radiometers retrieve the wet tropospheric path delay (PD) of the atmosphere and use internal <b>noise</b> <b>diodes</b> (NDs) for gain calibration.
