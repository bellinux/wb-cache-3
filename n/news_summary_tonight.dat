50|$|BBC Scotland {{started using}} their own {{continuity}} announcers for all evening and weekend afternoon junctions around 1977; before this period, announcers only covered opt-outs, {{which resulted in the}} London announcer being heard most of the time. From 1979, their duties were expanded to cover the lunchtime news bulletin at 12:40, just before the network Midday News at 12:45. There was one announcer who was never seen: Robert Logan, who was also a Conservative councillor. Consequently, he never read the <b>news</b> <b>summaries,</b> nor did he ever give his name at closedown. From 1985, the announcing team started doing a <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> just before children's programmes at around 15:53, and within a few weeks, additional <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> at 21:25 were introduced. From 31 October 1988, newsroom staff started to read the <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> instead of the announcers.|$|R
