50|$|According to pre-revolutionary laws, Tunisian {{children}} inherited their citizenship from: <b>a</b> <b>Tunisian</b> father; <b>a</b> <b>Tunisian</b> {{mother and}} <b>an</b> unknown father; <b>a</b> <b>Tunisian</b> mother and <b>a</b> father {{who has no}} nationality; or birth in Tunisia to <b>a</b> <b>Tunisian</b> mother and <b>a</b> foreign father. Children were entitled to free education {{up to and including}} university. School attendance was mandatory up to age 16. Under the pre-revolutionary government there were severe penalties for assaulting minors, but prosecution of such offenses was extremely rare. Government-employed social workers assisted abused children, and the Ministry of Women's Affairs, Family, Children, and Elderly Persons “employed a child protection delegate in each of the country's 24 districts to intervene in cases of sexual, economic, or criminal exploitation of children.” Presumably these rules and protections are still in place in post-revolutionary Tunisia.|$|R
