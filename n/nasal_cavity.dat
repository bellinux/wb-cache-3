5|$|Their {{sense of}} smell, while {{much better than}} that of humans, {{is not quite as}} good as that of a dog. It is {{believed}} to {{play a key role in}} the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity,</b> which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity,</b> are the Vomeronasal organs, also called Jacobson's organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.|$|E
5|$|Salt glands {{are used}} by seabirds {{to deal with the}} salt they ingest by {{drinking}} and feeding (particularly on crustaceans), and to help them osmoregulate. The excretions from these glands (which are positioned in the head of the birds, emerging from the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity)</b> are almost pure sodium chloride.|$|E
5|$|The {{sense of}} smell is {{generated}} by receptor cells in the epithelium of the olfactory mucosa in the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity.</b> This information passes through a relatively permeable part of the skull to the olfactory nerve. This nerve transmits to the neural circuitry of the olfactory bulb from where information is passed to the olfactory cortex.|$|E

50|$|Because only thin {{shelves of}} bone {{separate}} the sphenoidal sinuses from the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities</b> below and hypophyseal fossa above, the pituitary gland can be surgically approached {{through the roof}} of the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities</b> by first passing through the anterioinferior aspect of the sphenoid bone and into the sinuses, followed by entry through the top of the sphenoid bone into the hypophyseal fossa.|$|R
5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity,</b> above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity.</b> The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E
5|$|A single large {{opening on}} either side of the back of the skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of the {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges on the inside of the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity</b> and a ridge at the back of the lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals.|$|E
5|$|An acute nosebleed may {{be managed}} {{with a variety}} of measures, such as packing of the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity</b> with {{absorbent}} swabs or gels. Removal of the packs after the bleeding may lead to reopening of the fragile vessels, and therefore lubricated or atraumatic packing is recommended. Some patients may wish to learn packing themselves to deal with nosebleeds without having to resort to medical help.|$|E

50|$|Rhinorrhea is also {{associated}} with shedding tears, whether from emotional events or from eye irritation. When excess tears are produced, the liquid drains through the inner corner of the eyelids, through the nasolacrimal duct, and into the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities.</b> As more tears are shed, more liquid flows into the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities.</b> The buildup of fluid is usually resolved via mucus expulsion through the nostrils.|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} of detailed flow patterns in human <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities</b> using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) can provide essential information on the potential relationship between patient-specific geometrical characteristics of the nasal anatomy and health problems, and ultimately led to improved surgery. The complex flow structure and the intricate geometry of the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities</b> make achieving such goals a challenge for CFD specialists. The need for experimental data to validate and improve the numerical simulations is particularly crucial. To this aim an experimental set-up based on Stereo PIV and a silicon phantom of <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities</b> have been designed and realized at Politecnico di Milano. This work describes the main features and challenges of the set-up along with some preliminary results...|$|R
5|$|Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve {{release of}} air {{flow through the}} <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity,</b> and these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds are defined {{by the way the}} tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called rhotics) that are {{characterized}} by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.|$|E
5|$|The cranial {{features}} Ocepeia {{shares with}} primitive eutherians include eye-sockets (orbits) set further {{back on the}} skull, relatively narrow cheek bones (zygomatic arches), and details of the inner ear, while characters it shares with paenungulates their paenungulate-like ancestors include a wide <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity</b> and a very short bony projection in the eye-socket. Pneumatized skulls are also found in larger proboscideans (e.g. elephants, mastodons, and other extinct relatives).|$|E
5|$|The {{sense of}} smell, or olfaction, is highly {{important}} to lemurs and is frequently used in communication. Lemurs have long snouts (compared {{to the short}} snouts of haplorrhines) that are traditionally thought to position the nose for better sifting of smells, although long snouts do not necessarily translate into high olfactory acuity since {{it is not the}} relative size of the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity</b> that correlates with smell, but the density of olfactory receptors. Instead, the long snouts may facilitate better chewing.|$|E

5|$|Like other lambeosaurines such as Parasaurolophus and Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus had a {{distinctive}} crest {{on the top}} of its head. Its <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity</b> ran back through this crest, making it mostly hollow. Many suggestions have been made for the function or functions of the crest, including housing salt glands, improving the sense of smell, use as a snorkel or air trap, acting as a resonating chamber for making sounds, or being a method for different species or different sexes of the same species to recognize each other. Social functions such as noisemaking and recognition have become the most widely accepted of the various hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|On {{the inner}} {{surface of the}} nasal section of skull are ridges called nasoturbinals, which may have {{supported}} cartilage that increased {{the area of the}} olfactory epithelium, the layer of tissue that detects odors. These ridges are much smaller than those of later synapsids from the Late Permian and Triassic, whose large nasoturbinals are taken as evidence for warm-bloodedness because they may have supported mucous membranes that warmed and moistened incoming air. Thus, the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity</b> of Dimetrodon is transitional between those of early land vertebrates and mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{develops in}} {{the third week of}} embryogenesis from interactions between the diencephalon part of the brain and the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity.</b> The brain cells secrete FGF-8, Wnt5a and BMP-4, and the oral cavity BMP-2. Together, these cellular signals stimulate a group of cells from the oral cavity to form Rathke's pouch, which becomes independent of the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity</b> and develops into the anterior pituitary; this process includes the suppression of production of a protein called Sonic hedgehog by the cells of Rathke's pouch. The cells then differentiate further into the various hormone-producing cells of the pituitary. This requires particular transcription factors that induce the expression of particular genes. Some of these transcription factors {{have been found to be}} deficient in some forms of rare combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD) in childhood. These are HESX1, PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, TBX19, SOX2 and SOX3. Each transcription factor acts in particular groups of cells. Therefore, various genetic mutations are associated with specific hormone deficiencies. For instance, POU1F1 (also known as Pit-1) mutations cause specific deficiencies in growth hormone, prolactin and TSH. In addition to the pituitary, some of the transcription factors are also required for the development of other organs; some of these mutations are therefore also associated with specific birth defects.|$|E

30|$|In {{a recent}} paper [19], we showed the {{potential}} {{use of the}} vortex tube to selective lowering of brain temperature using various sources of compressed air. In this study, we investigated whether blowing cooled air (− 5 to 16  °C) produced by a vortex tube into the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities</b> is an effective cooling method to selectively reduce and maintain brain temperature {{over an extended period}} of time before gradually returning to the baseline temperature on normal juvenile pigs. Cooling the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities</b> may offer the capacity to cool the brain selectively due to anatomic proximity of the internal carotid artery to the cavernous sinus. Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) chilled at the basal cistern cools the whole brain through the CSF circulation. Although it is unlikely that air at subzero temperature will induce freezing damage to the mucosa, embedded blood vessels, and nerves of the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities,</b> we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities</b> for tissue damage in three pigs following ~ 7  h of cooling. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of the proposed selective brain cooling (SBC) method on cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by CT perfusion [20].|$|R
5|$|Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be {{sensitive}} to anesthesia. This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue in the throat directly behind the mouth and <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity,</b> known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which {{may be associated with}} cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Emily B. Griffin {{found that}} Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs {{had a good}} sense of smell (olfaction), based on the study of cranial endocasts that showed large {{olfactory}} bulbs in the brain. In 2014, Jason M. Bourke and colleagues found that Stegoceras would have needed cartilaginous nasal turbinates {{in the front of the}} nasal passages for airflow to reach the olfactory region. Evidence for the presence of this structure is a bony ridge to which it could have attached. The size of the olfactory region also indicates that Stegoceras had a keen sense of smell. The researchers found that the dinosaur could have had either a scroll-shaped turbinate (like in a turkey) or a branched one (as in an ostrich) as both could have directed air to the olfactory region. The blood vessel system in the passages also suggest that the turbinates served to cool down warm arterial blood from the body that was heading to the brain. The skull of S. validum specimen UALVP 2 was suited for a study of this kind due to its exceptional preservation; it has ossified soft tissue in the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity,</b> which would otherwise be cartilaginous and therefore not preserved through mineralization.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} {{hypotheses}} have been discredited or rejected. For example, {{there is no}} hole {{at the end of}} the crest for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses, and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity</b> of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had little to do with the sense of smell.|$|E
50|$|Rhinorrhea is {{characterized}} by an excess amount of mucus produced by the mucous membranes that line the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities.</b> The membranes create mucus faster than it can be processed, causing a backup of mucus in the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities.</b> As the cavity fills up, it blocks off the air passageway, causing difficulty breathing through the nose. Air caught in <b>nasal</b> <b>cavities,</b> namely the sinus cavities, cannot be released and the resulting pressure may cause a headache or facial pain. If the sinus passage remains blocked, {{there is a chance}} that sinusitis may result. If the mucus backs up through the Eustachian tube, it may result in ear pain or an ear infection. Excess mucus accumulating in the throat or back of the nose may cause a post-nasal drip, resulting in a sore throat or coughing. Additional symptoms include sneezing, nosebleeds, and nasal discharge.|$|R

5|$|The nasal {{openings}} {{were large}} and faced frontwards. The nasal bone was thick, heavily sculpted, {{and had a}} convex profile. It formed a boss (shield) on the middle top of the skull together with the frontal bone. The lower front of the premaxilla (front bone of the upper jaw) was rugose and thickened. A small foramen (hole) was present in the suture between the premaxillae, leading into the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity,</b> and possibly connected to the Jacobson's organ (an olfactory sense organ). The maxilla was short and deep, and probably contained a sinus. The maxilla {{had a series of}} foramina that corresponded with each tooth position there, and these functioned as passages for erupting replacement teeth. The mandible articulated with the skull below the back of the orbit. The tooth-bearing part of the lower jaw was long, with the part behind being rather short. Though not preserved, the presence of a predentary bone is indicated by facets {{at the front of the}} lower jaw. Like other pachycephalosaurs, it would have had a small beak.|$|E
5|$|The robust nasal bones, {{preserved}} {{in a single}} specimen, are widest at the front, a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos, and are also unusually flat. The ethmoid labyrinth, in the <b>nasal</b> <b>cavity,</b> was large, suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had {{a good sense of}} smell. A much larger part of the nasal septum, which separates the left and right nasal cavities, is ossified than usual in other mammals; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths, which have a very short nose. The lacrimal bone is relatively large. At it is a single lacrimal canal, which opens near the suture between the frontal and lacrimal bones, like in lipotyphlans. There is a small tubercle (absent in aardvarks) near this opening. The orbital cavity, which houses the eyes, is relatively short, similar to the situation in pangolins and armadillos. A distinct tubercle is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P.germainepetterae, but not P.madagascariensis. P.madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits. The foramen rotundum, an opening in the bone of the orbit, is present. The optic canal, which houses the nerves leading to the eyes, is narrow, suggesting that the eyes were small, similar to many other tenrecoids. As in pangolins and xenarthrans, little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above. The temporal lines on the braincase, which anchor muscles, are located lower in P.germainepetterae. Like in aardvarks, the parietals are relatively large. An interparietal bone is present. Unlike in anteaters and pangolins, the occiput (the back of the skull) is flat and vertical. Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the foramen magnum (the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord), which are present in aardvarks. The nuchal crest, a projection on the occiput, is straight in P.madagascariensis, but in P.germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle, similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes.|$|E
