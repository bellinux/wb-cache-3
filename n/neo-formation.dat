This torrential-stream deposit, close to enlaced rivers, laid to the deposition of sandy-clayey materials, with a variable iron content, coming from a lateritic weathering, of the French “Massif Central” granites. The presence of numerous lignite rich levels indicates that the deposit was performed {{in the presence of}} abundant organic matter, leading to important pedogenetic and diagenetic possibilities of evolutions. These chemical and mineralogical evolutions (dissolution-crystallization) allow the <b>neo-formation</b> of kaolin and gibbsite, as well as iron sulfide.|$|E
50|$|Gibbsite is not {{stable in}} {{presence}} of quartz {{and it will}} be changed into kaolinite minerals, so gibbsite has formed after the deposition and we can call it <b>neo-formation</b> gibbsite. Now, the main question is about gibbsite formation in the middle of kaolin series. Due to the pH of leaching, a dissolution of Al2O3 or SiO2 can occur (podzol or laterite profile) The first theory tries to describe this with podzol profiles: it assumes the leaching of silica from minerals and accordingly the gibbsite formation from leached kaolin. We thus should find the hyper-aluminous materials, containing gibbsite in the lower series of kaolin. On the other hand, a second theory proposes the procedure of aluminium leaching in a very acid medium, in deposited organic materials (lignite) with clay. The organic materials can accelerate the solubilization and transportation of aluminium ions with intervention of organic complex. proposed the following scenarios for this dissolved aluminium.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Oral cavity {{has been}} {{investigated}} for several provided stem cells “niches”; among them, gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) represent an alternative source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) since their features make them ideal for bone tissue engineering. Indeed, compared to bone marrow-MSCs, GMSCs are easier to be harvested and showed better performances in proliferation and osteogenic differentiation abilities. Our aim was to analyze the ability of GMSCs harvested from periodontally compromised teeth to regenerate bone tissue in vivo. Materials and Methods GMSCs were harvested from periodontally compromised (Test group) and healthy gingival tissues (Control group) and grown according to the methodology described in our previous study. After proliferation, 2 x 10 ^ 5 GMSCs of both groups were seeded on a Poly-L-lactic Acid (PLLA) scaffold with 5 - 20 μm micropores, produced by Thermally Induced Phase Separation technique (TIPS), in presence or not of osteogenic differentiation factors. Then scaffolds were transplanted subcutaneously into the dorsal region of 2 immuno-compromised rats (2 scaffolds for each rat), following procedures approved by the Italian Minister of Health (No. 1185 / 2015). After 8 weeks from the transplant, the animals were sacrificed, the tissue samples harvested and immuno-histochemical and RT-qPCR analysis of canonical osteogenic genes were performed to evaluate the rate of bone tissue <b>neo-formation.</b> Results The results of immune-histochemical analysis show <b>neo-formation</b> of bone tissue in both groups, with no difference. Moreover, {{there is a high}} level of inflamed cells, probably related to the synthetic scaffolds applied, certainly more versatile but also more immunogenic, compared to the natural ones. Finally, it does not seem that the osteogenic factors had any influence on the differentiation rate of GMSCs. RT-qPCR analysis shows the increased expression of canonical osteogenic genes (e. g. RUNX 2, Osteopontin, Osteocalcin and Alkaline Phosphatase) in all samples analyzed. Conclusions Interestingly, a much higher expression level of the osteogenic genes was observed in the experimental group compared to the control group, suggesting a possible role of inflamed environment on improving the osteogenic differentiation ability of stem cells. Even if preliminary, these observations demonstrated that GMSCs from periodontally compromised teeth, usually discarded tissues, may represent a valuable stem cell source for bone tissue engineering...|$|E

This paper concerns chlorate ion formation during chlorine dioxide generation and oxidation reactions, in relation {{with the use of}} sodium hypochlorite solutions. This aspect is very important taking into account that current WHO Drinking water Guidelines suggest a limit of 700 µg/L for chlorate ion.

In the Passiflora group the only dosage used was administered by intraperitonial injection of hydoalcoholic extract of Passiflora edulis leaves while in the Control group distilled water was injected. Each subgroup was then divided in two subgroups according {{to the death of}} these animals: Control, three and seven days, Passiflora, three and seven days. After the death of these animals, an inventory of the abdominal cavity was performed and the bladder was removed. A comparative analysis was done between the two groups with microscopic evaluation of the healing. There was less acute inflammation (p= 0. 008), greater colagenous formation (p= 0. 001) and greater capillary <b>neo-formation</b> (p= 0. 000) in the third day Passiflora subgroup when compared to the Control subgroup of the third day. RESULTS: There was less acute inflammation (p= 0. 001), greater fibroblastic proliferation (p= 0. 011) and greater colagenous formation (p= 0. 001) in the Passiflora subgroup of seventh day when compared with the Control seventh day subgroup. CONCLUSION: The use of Passiflora edulis leaves extract resulted in less acute inflammation, greater fibroblastic proliferation, colagenous formation and capillary <b>neo-formation</b> on rats bladder wound healing...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present bulk XRF/XRD and micro {{analytical}} SEM/EMPA data on historical bricks from Medieval/Renaissance buildings of Ferrara (NE Italy) to provide insights {{on the nature}} and provenance of the raw material as well as clues on the sintering techniques. Chemical data indicate that the starting materials were obtained by mixing high Cr-Ni clay and subordinate sand (both quarried from the Po river alluvial deposits) with the possible introduction of a Na-rich flux component. Thin section observation, XRD and micro-analytical data indicate the presence of key accessory phases such as pyroxene, amphibole, epidote and rare olivine in the pre-fired mineral assemblage and confirming the utilization of the Po river sediments. Recognition of <b>neo-formation</b> firing phases (e. g. melilite, wollastonite), together with composition of micas, amphiboles and interstitial glasses, indicate kiln temperatures between 800 and 1000 °C. This provides guidelines to make new compatible and durable bricks to be utilised for restoration {{and contribute to the}} preservation of historical masonries. Ancient bricks from Medieval and Renaissance buildings of Ferrara (NE Italy) have been studied using bulk techniques that analyse a few grams of homogenised (powdered) sample, and micro analytical techniques that allow composition analysis of single phases of materials heterogeneous at micrometre scale. This characterisation provides useful clues to constrain the provenance of the original raw materials and the historical firing techniques. These data provide information useful to understand the physico-chemical behaviour of the studied bricks that will be helpful in future preservation and restoration strategies...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{technical}} progress in interventional techniques {{to overcome the}} harmful effects of ischemic heart disease there is still an urgent need for alternative, pharmaceutical treatment modalities. Exogenous stimulation of vessel growth, i. e. vasculogenesis, angiogenesis or arteriogenesis serves as a promising strategy to restore blood flow to the jeopardized tissue regions downstream of arterial stenosis or occlusion. While vasculogenesis is defined as the arrangement of angioblasts during prenatal development creating the first vascular network, angiogenesis and arteriogenesis refer to important adaptive mechanisms in the adult organism. Angiogenesis, <b>neo-formation</b> of capillaries, is a key process in many different physiological and pathophysiological events where improvement of microvascular function and tissue nutrition is needed (e. g. wound healing, tumor growth). In contrast to this capillary sprouting, the term arteriogenesis refers to the development of large caliber collateral arteries. Under conditions of increasing shear stress, anastomoses between interconnected perfusion territories can undergo adaptive enlargement, developing into a functional network of collateral arteries, natural bypasses able to maintain sufficient blood flow and compensating for the gradual occlusion of a large artery (e. g. in the coronary circulation). However, in most cases arteriogenesis does not proceed as fast as the stenosis progresses and infarction and tissue necrosis results. A well-developed collateral network is an important protective factor for the occurrence of ischemic events and therefore pharmaceutical acceleration and stimulation of arteriogenesis in patients represents an eminent aim for the future. This review focuses on the basic mechanisms of arteriogenesis, the recent progresses in translating these insights into the clinical situation and the problems yet to be solve...|$|E
40|$|Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and {{angiogenesis}} {{are crucial}} events {{for development of}} aggressive and often fatal Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas (OSCCs). Both promote cancer progression and metastasis development, but while the former induces the loss of E-cadherin expression and, hence cadherin switching; the latter produces haematic blood vessel <b>neo-formation</b> and contribute to OSCC cell growth, tumor mass development, and dissemination. Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) has an important role, not only in angiogenic mechanisms, but also in favoring cancer invasion. Indeed it decreases the expression of E-cadherin and leads to phenotypic changes in epithelial cells (EMT) enhancing their carcinogenic potential. Our aim is to evaluate the interplay between E-cadherin cytoplasmic delocalization, COX- 2 up-regulation and COX- 2 induced neo-angiogenesis in 120 cases of OSCC. We have analyzed the distribution {{and the number of}} neo-formed endothelial buds surrounding infiltrating cells that express COX- 2, as well as the neo-formed vessels in chronic inflammatory infiltrate, which surround the tumor. A double immunostaining method was employed in order to verify co-localization of endothelial cell marker (CD 34) and COX- 2. IHC has also been used to assess E-cadherin expression. Our data demonstrate that the OSCC cells, which lose membranous E-cadherin staining, acquiring a cytoplasmic delocalization, overexpress COX- 2. Moreover, we find a new CD 34 + vessel formation (sprouting angiogenesis). Only basaloid type of OSCC showes low level of COX- 2 expression together with very low level of neo-angiogenesis and consequent tumor necrosis. The well-known anti-metastatic effect of certain COX- 2 inhibitors suggests that these molecules might have clinical utility in the management of advanced cancers...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} is {{a central}} and vital structure of eukaryotic cells. It consists of a dynamic network of partially interconnected polymers. This extended network controls the mechanical properties of animal cells, serves as intracellular transport pathways, and plays {{a prominent role in}} cell motility, proliferation, and adhesion. in order to evaluate the action of laser irradiation on the cytoskeleton and proliferation of endothelial cells, rabbit aortic endothelial cells (RAEC) were irradiated with 685 -nm low-level laser (20 mW output power). Fluorescent dye rhodamine-phalloidin staining was used to visualize the effect of laser irradiation on actin filaments. Irradiation with 8 J/cm(2) was performed four times at 12 -h intervals for 24 min. Cells cultured under low fetal bovine serum condition (5 % FBS) for 7 days presented actin staining predominantly in the cortical membrane region and a few actin filament stress fibers. However, the formation of stress fibers similar to those of control cells increased significantly in irradiated cells, It was concluded that laser irradiation induces changes in the cytoskeleton of endothelial cells through the reorganization of actin filaments and <b>neo-formation</b> of stress fibers, allowing evident cellular proliferation.

40|$|While {{traditionally}} surgery {{has dominated}} the clinical management of Buruli ulcer (BU), {{the introduction of the}} combination chemotherapy with oral rifampicin and intramuscular streptomycin greatly improved treatment and reduced recurrence rates. However management of the often extensive lesions after successful specific therapy has remained a challenge, in particular in rural areas of the African countries which carry the highest burden of disease. For reasons not fully understood, wound healing is delayed in a proportion of antibiotic treated BU patients. Therefore, we have performed immunohistochemical investigations to identify markers which may be suitable to monitor wound healing progression.; Tissue specimens from eight BU patients with plaque lesions collected before, during and after chemotherapy were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the presence of a set of markers associated with connective tissue <b>neo-formation,</b> tissue remodeling and epidermal activation. Several target proteins turned out to be suitable to monitor wound healing. While α-smooth muscle actin positive myofibroblasts were not found in untreated lesions, they emerged during the healing process. These cells produced abundant extracellular matrix proteins, such as pro-collagen 1 and tenascin and were found in fibronectin rich areas. After antibiotic treatment many cells, including myofibroblasts, revealed an activated phenotype as they showed ribosomal protein S 6 phosphorylation, a marker for translation initiation. In addition, healing wounds revealed dermal tissue remodeling by apoptosis, and showed increased cytokeratin 16 expression in the epidermis.; We have identified a set of markers that allow monitoring wound healing in antibiotic treated BU lesions by immunohistochemistry. Studies with this marker panel may help to better understand disturbances responsible for wound healing delays observed in some BU patients...|$|E
