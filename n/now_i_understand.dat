500|$|Issued by Apple Records in the United States in October 1971, [...] "Imagine" [...] {{became the}} best-selling single of Lennon's solo career. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard Hot 100 and reached number one in Canada on the RPM {{national}} singles chart, remaining there for two weeks. Upon its release the song's lyrics upset some religious groups, particularly the line: [...] "Imagine there's no heaven". When asked about the song {{during one of his}} final interviews, Lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with the Beatles. He described the song's meaning and explicated its commercial appeal: [...] "Anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic, but because it is sugarcoated it is accepted ... <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> what you have to do. Put your political message across with a little honey." [...] In an open letter to Paul McCartney published in Melody Maker, Lennon said that [...] "Imagine" [...] was [...] "'Working Class Hero' with sugar on it for conservatives like yourself". On 30 November 1971, the Imagine LP reached number one on the UK chart. It became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career.|$|E
60|$|MORELL (with long drawn significance, {{looking at}} Burgess). O-o-o-h, the chairman. <b>NOW</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b>|$|E
60|$|Gril. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> you; I should murder him: I am your soldier, sir, but {{not your}} hangman.|$|E
60|$|As for me, I {{sat down}} upon a stone and groaned, for <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> everything.|$|R
60|$|I had {{followed}} his words with changing emotion, but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> believed <b>I</b> <b>understood.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> {{it was not}} the war, but Mr. Marmaduke himself, {{which had}} carried his family to this pass. And some of my old resentment rekindled.|$|R
60|$|NAPOLEON. That {{accounts}} for it. The English {{are a nation}} of shopkeepers. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> why you've beaten me.|$|E
60|$|LADY MARY. If? <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> The perfect servant at home {{holds that}} we are all equal now. I see.|$|E
60|$|Limb. That is, Pug, he cannot {{possibly}} take ten guineas, 'tis to his loss: <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> him; this {{is almost}} English.|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood!</b> Elias was to reconnoiter {{the river}} for his very good friends, and we could catch him on his return, as we had done once before.|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood,</b> and, bending down, I {{felt the}} heart of Umslopogaas, and laid the down of an eagle upon his lips. His heart still stirred and the down was lifted gently.|$|R
5000|$|.....this {{represented}} {{a completely different}} order of turkey. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> what turkey was like before {{the triumph of the}} Broad Breasted White, and why eating turkey had once been considered a great treat... Michael Pollan ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nice! It was--oh, I'd like to swear!" [...] I ejaculated. [...] "But <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> my miserable feeling. I was jealous, Sally, I'm sorry. I apologize." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{noticed an}} {{extraordinary}} change in Williams's reports, {{both in the}} handwriting and expression. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it. You work the same stall as Haden, do you not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, I {{see it all}} <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it all. Clara, {{you must}} forget me, and come here no more. You shall not be ruined because you are generous." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could see}} the bluff that the Haughts had climbed so laboriously, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> why they had been so slow. It was {{straight}} up, brush and jumbled rock, and two hundred feet over my head. Somewhere above that bluff was the bluff where our bear had run along.|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood,</b> and a {{cold sweat}} broke out all over me. My companions were to be murdered, every one! Oh! gladly would I have given my life to warn them. But alas! I could not, for the cloth upon my mouth was so thick that no sound could pass it.|$|R
6000|$|I proffered him {{the whole}} box, {{but he would}} not take it, saying that the King would like me to give it to him myself. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> that this was a summons to an audience, and asked when it would please Panda to receive me and [...] "the-little-black-stones-that-work-wonders." [...] He answered--at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{distinction}} is just, and, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> you, abundantly [...] obvious; but hardly {{worth the trouble}} of your inventing a puzzle of [...] words {{to make it appear}} otherwise."] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can she <b>now?</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> {{what you}} mean, but I don't believe {{a word of}} it. The bishop manages his own affairs himself, quite {{as much as you}} do, or Mr. Harold Smith." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, a thingamajig for dogs? <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> You {{will put}} things so obscurely at first. Ginger, you poor fish, {{what are you}} raving about? What on earth is a thingamajig for dogs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|No wonder Miss Howard had {{suggested}} [...] "hushing it up." [...] <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> that unfinished sentence of hers: [...] "Emily herself----" [...] And {{in my heart}} I agreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go unavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name of Cavendish.|$|R
60|$|While {{hearing the}} story it was {{impossible}} for me to realize how agonizing must have been the position of the besieged man. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> it keenly, and resolved not to look out from that side of the house again, lest the painted fiends should begin their horrible work before night came.|$|R
50|$|The {{experience}} changed my outlook. Until <b>now</b> <b>I</b> had clung to the comforting belief that human beings eventually {{come to terms with}} pain and sorrow. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>I</b> was wrong, and like Paul I suffered a conversion - but to pessimism. These little girls, any one of whom could be my daughter, came into the restaurant weeping, and they were weeping when they were led away. I knew that, condemned to everlasting darkness, hunger and loss, they would weep on incessantly. They would never recover from their pain, and I would never recover from the memory of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> {{his visit}} to Marmion," [...] said Mr. Excell, with a sudden smile. [...] "I thought {{he came to see}} Jack and me. He really came to see you. Am I right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Great Medicine of the Opener-of-Roads!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Oh, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> {{why this}} Chief of the People of the Axe is unconquerable--such a wizard {{that no one}} is able to kill him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's absurd!" [...] Mowbray exclaimed. [...] "False pride; mistaken sentiment! We {{know the}} {{advantage}} of springing from a good stock. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> why I sometimes felt a curious sympathy with Harding, even when I hated his opinions." ...|$|E
60|$|Charlie {{spoke on}} and on, and on; while I, {{separated}} from him {{by thousands of}} years, was considering the beginnings of things. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> why the Lords of Life and Death shut the doors so carefully behind us. It is that we may not remember our first wooings. Were it not so, our world would be without inhabitants in a hundred years.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was a coward," [...] Douglas said decidedly. [...] "Even <b>now</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>understand</b> why for {{a moment}} I ever {{accepted}} such an impossible situation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{but they}} have always brought some sort of sauce piquante with them. <b>Now,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> you, these friends of yours have no such sauce." ...|$|R
6000|$|ANN. [rising {{in sudden}} enlightenment] O-o-o-o-oh! <b>NOW</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> why you warned Tavy that I am a boa constrictor. Granny told me. [She laughs and throws her boa around her neck]. Doesn't it feel nice and soft, Jack? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O yes, miss! <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> I've {{had such}} {{people come in}} past years. But it didn't strike me that you looked of a sort to require blood-turning. What's the complaint? The wrong kind for this, I'll be bound.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{used not to}} see the expediency, and I did {{not like}} the parting; but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> your father's wishes, and the sort of {{allegiance}} he feels towards India, so that Gilbert's reluctance will be a great mortification to him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, but I {{dare say}} {{my father is}} there by <b>now,</b> for <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> that he is coming down this {{afternoon}} to arrange about the shooting." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Story Girl {{impersonated}} {{the beggar}} maid so vividly, {{and with such}} an illusion of beauty, {{that we did not}} wonder in the least at the king's love for her. I had read the story before, and it had been my opinion that it was [...] "rot." [...] No king, I felt certain, would ever marry a beggar maid when he had princesses galore from whom to choose. But <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> it all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wa-a-l, <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>understand</b> leases in that way. Surely it {{was never}} {{intended}} a man should erect mills, to lose all right in 'em {{at the end of}} five-and-twenty years." ...|$|R
