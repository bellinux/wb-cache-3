40|$|A crucial {{element of}} the post- 2013 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform is the ‘greening’ payment. ‘Greening’ is a {{compulsory}} {{part of the new}} direct payment scheme, accounting for 30 per cent of <b>national</b> <b>ceilings.</b> To qualify, farmers must undertake compulsory agricultural practices that are ‘beneficial for the climate and the environment’, comprising crop diversification, maintenance of existing permanent grassland and establishing an ecological focus area or putting in place ‘equivalent measures’. The payment had a controversial legislative passage, with several environmental groups questioning its pro-environmental effects and alleging that it was merely a clever way of disguising product support to European Union (EU) farmers, even before several of the provisions were watered down by the European Parliament. Despite these difficulties, throughout the process all parties assumed the ‘greening’ payment was compatible with the Green Box exemption in the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), so that it would be exempt from the EU’s domestic support reduction commitments in that Agreement. Specifically, it was understood that the payment would be decoupled income support under paragraph 6 of Annex 2 to the AoA and as such the payment had ‘no, or at most minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production’ under paragraph 1 of the same Annex (the so-called ‘fundamental requirement’) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{combines}} {{an existing}} {{projection of the}} development of electricity production with a technology-specific environmental assessment. The combination of these two approaches, which so far have only been performed separately, allows a discussion about environmental effects of carbon capture and storage (CCS) implementation strategies on a national level. The results identify the future role of lignite and hard coal in German power production. The implementation of CCS technology leads to a considerable loss of efficiency. Due to CCS, about 50 million t of lignite will be additionally required in 2030 in comparison to the reference case without CCS in 2010. Increasing demand, the replacement of old plants and the compensation of efficiency losses lead to highly ambitious expansion rates. In the case of CCS implementation, the global warming potential (GWP) can be reduced by up to 70 %. However, other environmental impacts increase in part considerably. Compliance with <b>national</b> <b>ceilings</b> for NOx emissions can only be reached by compensation measures in other sectors The results of the environmental assessment demonstrate the significant role of the coal composition, coal origin and the required transport. CO 2 pipeline transport and CO 2 storage make a fairly minor contribution to the overall environmental impact. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The Dutch Cabinet has {{set down}} a {{national}} programme, drawn {{up in the}} framework of the European Directive on national emission ceilings (the NEC Directive), in an Implementation Memorandum, 'Make it or break it'. On request of the Cabinet, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (MNP) - RIVM took on the evaluation of the objectives and cost-effectiveness of this programme for. Conclusions and recommendations are reported here. A major conclusion is the strong probability that the Netherlands will not meet its international emission obligations for 3 out of 4 NEC compounds, SO 2, NOx and NMVOCs. Many of the measures and options for additional measures are not concrete and lack sufficient policy instruments for implementation. The choice made to translate <b>national</b> <b>ceilings</b> into sector targets has not been accepted by any of the sectors. This increases the risks surrounding implementation because of the uncertainty in the results of the policy package. Furthermore, the passage of time may mean that some of the reductions needed cannot be realised, making a declaration of default a very real possibility. In the case of ammonia, current policies may be sufficient to meet the target, although there is still a chance that the emission ceiling will be exceeded. Additional measures proposed are expected to bring the ammonia emissions under the ceiling. It will be possible to update the policy programme in 2006. In the meantime, it still {{remains to be seen whether}} 'Make it or break it' has set out the right implementation course for realising the Dutch national emission ceilings...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{systems can}} lose {{substantial}} amounts of nitrogen (N). To protect the environment, the European Union (EU) has adopted several directives that set goals to limit N losses. National Emission Ceilings (NEC) are prescribed in the NEC directive for nitrogen oxides and ammonia. Crop residues may contribute to ammonia volatilization, but sufficient information on their contribution to the national ammonia volatilization is lacking. Experiments were carried out with the aim to assess the ammonia volatilization of crop residues left on the soil surface or incorporated into the soil under the conditions met in practice in the Netherlands during late autumn and winter. Ammonia emission from residues of broccoli, leek, sugar beet, cut grass, fodder radish (fresh and frozen) and yellow mustard (frozen) was studied during two winter seasons using volatilization chambers. Residues were either placed on top of soil or mixed with soil. Mixing residues with soil gave insignificant ammonia volatilization, whereas volatilization was 5 – 16 percent of the N content of residues when placed on top of soil. Ammonia volatilization started after at least 4 days. Total ammonia volatilization was related to C/N-ratio and N concentration of the plant material. After 37 days, cumulative ammonia volatilization was negligible from plant material with N concentration below 2 percent, and was 10 percent of the N content of plant material with 4 percent N. These observations {{can be explained by}} decomposition of plant material by micro-organisms. After an initial built up of the microbial population, NH 4 + that is not needed for their own growth is released and can easily emit as NH 3 at the soil surface. The results of the experiments were used to estimate the contribution of crop residues to ammonia volatilization in the Netherlands. Crop residues of arable crops and residues of pasture topping may contribute more than 3 million kg NH 3 –N to the national ammonia volatilization of the Netherlands, being more than 3 percent of the national emissions in 2005. This contribution should therefore be considered when focusing on the <b>national</b> <b>ceilings</b> for ammonia emissions...|$|E
40|$|The 30 {{years of}} reform and opening have brought great {{material}} progress to China. By becoming a big country, China's actions created huge spillovers on other countries. The {{result has been a}} rise in trade tension between China and its trade partners. Recently, some have claimed that China's prolonged large trade surpluses have undermined global financial stability and tilted the world into a deep recession, if not a 1930 s-style depression. Others have claimed that the greenhouse gases from China's industrialization would soon cause cataclysmic global climate change. One blunt but effective way to eliminate these negative spillovers is to restrict imports from China. Labor in the rich countries is under considerable stress because of the deep global structural adjustments brought by: (1) the integration of the labor force of China, India and the Soviet bloc into the world economy; and (2) the acceleration of technological innovations (as exemplified by the revolution in information technology). The new global equilibrium could be a win-win outcome for the world but the process of moving to it is a painful one. Protectionism to avoid the transitional pains is, however, likely to end up in a lose-lose outcome for the world. China must therefore, in its own interests, help to reduce international tension by updating its strategy of international economic engagement. China has to go beyond being a passive beneficiary of the WTO system to being an active promoter of WTO objectives. China should work with the US to bring Doha Rounds negotiations to a successful conclusion. China must also play a stronger and more constructive role in the forthcoming international talks on global climate change. China and India are simply too big to be exempted for a long time from <b>national</b> <b>ceilings</b> on the emission of greenhouse gases. China will have to face down its internal political opposition to replace the backward state-controlled financial system with a dynamic, but well-regulated, diversified private financial system in order to eliminate the odd phenomenon of a poor country lending to a rich country.

40|$|Tesis Doctoral leída en la Universidad Rey Juan Carlos en 2014. Directores de la Tesis: Helena Cabal y Antonio Alonso-AyusoDuring last {{decades the}} {{environmental}} protection awareness has been growing considerably in the European Union. Specially, climate change concern {{has become one of}} the foremost problems to fight with. In 2003, the European Commission approved Directive 2003 / 87 /EC establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission allowance trading. The main objective of this Directive was to promote the reduction of GHG emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner to meet the Kyoto Protocol targets. After that, the European Commission approved Directive 2009 / 29 /EC extending the scope of the previous one and establishing a reduction of 20 % in the GHG emissions in 2020 respect to the 1990 level. Analogously, Directive 2001 / 81 /EC set <b>national</b> <b>ceilings</b> for acidification, eutrophication and tropospheric ozone gases. Cement production and electricity generation sectors are two of the main sources of pollutants in the European Union. This work has focused on the environmental consequences and the compliance of the emissions-related Directives in these sectors in Spain. The current work applies the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, an environmental management tool that evaluates the potential environmental impacts of a product or process throughout its entire life cycle, to the cement manufacture in Spain. As a result, main hotspots such as the combustion of fossil and alternative fuels at the kiln have been identified and assessed in detail. Moreover, various technology improvements such as Best Available Techniques (BAT), and material and fossil fuels substitution scenarios have been implemented. Results have revealed that changing the fossil fuels by alternative fuels derived from waste entails significant reductions in most of the impact categories except for eutrophication. In the same manner, to reduce the clinker content in cement diminishes most of the impacts. This measure shows more problems than fuel substitution because it requires substituting the clinker by secondary materials such as blast furnace slag, fly ashes and pozzolanas, at the same time that mechanical and chemical properties of the cement must be preserved. Going further, an exploratory analysis has been made including the CO 2 capture technology in the Spanish cement-making. Results have shown the effects of the post-combustion CO 2 capture. It has been observed that this technology is very expensive and most of the impact categories such as human toxicity, eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, acidification, photochemical ozone formation and land use change grow by several times. The main problem is the extremely high amount of heat required - the energy penalty - so natural gas and biomass cogeneration (CHP) plants have been proposed as alternatives to substitute the coal-fired CHP plant. Consequently, more research is needed to reduce costs and emissions. Along with the environmental assessment of the cement manufacture, a modelling analysis has been carried out in order to assess these Directives. TIMES-Spain energy optimisation model has been used. Previously, several calibrations, technology updates and other policies implementations have been made. In addition, measures analysed in the LCA study have been implemented in TIMES-Spain. Considering several scenarios related to CO 2 emissions, cement demands and investment costs, the effect of the Directives has been analysed from 2010 to the end of horizon, 2050. It has been concluded that Directive 2009 / 29 /EC involves great reductions in CO 2 emissions respect to a case without Directive, reaching almost 50 % in 2050. The application of Directive 2001 / 81 /EC is not significant from the point of view of the cement-making because NOx and SO 2 emissions are already low respect to the total amounts. The high share of the cement sector CO 2 emissions respect to the total has shown the difficulties of the cement industry respect to other industries in terms of emissions reduction efforts. Also, it has been observed that CO 2 capture technology does not appear except when high cement demands and stringent sectorial CO 2 limits are imposed. It has been recommended to reduce the CO 2 emissions limits to the cement manufacturing sector in Spain assuming that 2013 - 2020 allowances allocation does not force the cement producers to make new investments since the expected cement demands are too low. Besides, the application of the emissions-related Directives in the electricity production sector has been assessed. Several calibrations and developments have been implemented in TIMES-Spain. Emissions and fossil fuel prices scenarios have been included. Externalities of the electricity production have been internalised as well as taxes on CO 2, NOx and SO 2 have been evaluated to assess the Directives effects. As a result, a high contribution of natural gas in the electricity mix takes place when Directives are applied. The evolution of the electricity production system is mainly characterized by the coal phase-out in 2015, followed by the growth of natural gas combined cycle plants and the entrance of natural gas cogeneration plants in industry from 2030. Beyond 2030 renewable technologies are significantly implemented, in particular wind and solar. The contribution of solar photovoltaic plants is remarkable in the long-term. In addition, it has been observed the disappearance of the CO 2 emissions in 2035. Taxes on CO 2 have effect from 30 €/t CO 2 in 2030 and 50 €/t CO 2 in 2050. It has also been relevant the taxation on NOx, especially from 2030 with a considerable growth of natural gas cogeneration plants. Finally, it has been recommended to update Directive 2001 / 81 /EC for establishing a new ceiling for Spain. In particular, the SO 2 ceiling should be reduced below 450 - 500 kt SO 2 per year. On the other hand, it has been suggested to extend the target imposed by Directive 2009 / 29 /EC, to a 50 % reduction (in absolute CO 2) in 2050 respect to the 2005 level. Moreover, 80 % reduction target by 2050 has been proved to be achievable. In that case, an energy carrier shift takes place from electricity to heat in industry, residential and commercial sectors. The application of the previous methodologies shows the importance of considering integrated approaches which deal with more than one aspect. In the current work, environmental and prospective strategies have been merged. As a result, interesting conclusions and recommendations have been obtained not only relevant for the Spanish policymakers and industries but also for the Spanish society.

Both static and dynamic analyses highlighted an expected decrease in the concentration of direct payments by 2019 because Italy will progressively shift from the “historical” regional model to a tunnel model for internal convergence during the transitional 2015 – 2020 period. Conversely, the decrease in the DP/FI ratio between 2014 and 2019 due to both policy changes and exogenous factors is expected to negatively affect the ability of these payments to oppose the regressive effect of MIs, particularly for regions and sectors that mainly benefitted from the SPS introduced by CAP 2003 reform. In more detail, the results indirectly highlight that the more farm income is affected by changing market conditions (increasingly influenced by price volatility) related to output composition (consumption, investment, government expenditure, and gross exports and imports), the more unequally it is distributed. This phenomenon is affected by any increase (decrease) in the budget for DPs, which could improve (worsen) the stabilization and redistribution of farm income and reduce (increase) its concentration since such aid tends to equalize farm income.|$|R
