5000|$|The Curta was {{conceived}} by Curt Herzstark in the 1930s in Vienna, Austria. By 1938, he had filed a key patent, covering his complemented stepped drum, Deutsches Reichspatent (German National Patent) No. 747073. This single drum replaced the multiple drums, typically around 10 or so, of contemporary calculators, and it enabled not only addition, but subtraction through <b>nines</b> <b>complement</b> math, essentially subtracting by adding. The nines' complement math breakthrough eliminated the significant mechanical complexity created when [...] "borrowing" [...] during subtraction. This drum {{would prove to}} be the key to the small, hand-held mechanical calculator the Curta would become.|$|E
50|$|In the decimal {{numbering}} system, the {{radix complement}} {{is called the}} ten's complement and the diminished radix complement the nines' complement. In binary, the radix complement is called the two's complement and the diminished radix complement the ones' complement. The naming of complements in other bases is similar. Some people, notably Donald Knuth, recommend using {{the placement of the}} apostrophe to distinguish between the radix complement and the diminished radix complement. In this usage, the four's complement refers to the radix complement of a number in base four while fours' complement is the diminished radix complement of a number in base 5. However, the distinction is not important when the radix is apparent (nearly always), and the subtle difference in apostrophe placement is not common practice. Most writers use one's and nine's complement, and many style manuals leave out the apostrophe, recommending ones and <b>nines</b> <b>complement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Counter entries. An IBM tabulating machine, {{such as the}} 402 or 407 series {{would have}} several {{counters}} available in different sizes. (For example, the IBM 402/403 had four sets each of 2, 4, 6 and 8 digit counters, labeled 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 4A, 4B etc.) Each counter had two counter control entries to specify either addition (plus) or subtraction (minus). If neither were pulsed, no operation was performed. If addition was commanded, a digit impulse wired from a column to a counter entry hub started the counter wheel turning. It stopped automatically at zero time. Thus a pulse at 8 time caused the wheel to advance 8 steps, adding the value 8 to that counter position. Carries within a group were performed automatically. Carry in and carry out hubs allowed counters to be coupled, permitting longer numbers to be accumulated. Subtraction was more complicated and used <b>nines</b> <b>complement</b> arithmetic.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the gears}} of the {{calculator}} rotated {{in only one}} direction, negative numbers could not be directly summed. To subtract one number from another, the method of <b>nine's</b> <b>complement</b> was used.

So, 999 &minus; 432 = 567, and 567 + 1 = 568. By preceding 568 in BCD by the negative sign code, the number &minus;432 can be represented. So, &minus;432 in signed BCD is 1001 0101 0110 1000.|$|R

Special {{circuits}} allowed negative values to be printed correctly, not as <b>nines</b> <b>complements,</b> and a special exit was provided to allow an appropriate symbol ("cr" [...] or [...] "-") to be printed next to the number when it was negative.|$|R

40|$|Sera from 15 {{patients}} with genetically determined complement component deficiencies were studied {{for the presence}} of antibodies to various nuclear antigens. One of three {{patients with}} C 2 deficiency presented with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); all eight patients with C 4 deficiency had either SLE or a lupus-like syndrome, and two of four patients with functional C 1 q deficiency had SLE. Five of <b>nine</b> <b>complement</b> deficiency patients with SLE studied had measurable antinuclear antibody titres, but only two had antibodies against native DNA. Precipitating antibodies against extractable nuclear antigens were found in sera from seven of the 11 complement deficient patients with SLE; one had only antibodies against antigens extracted from calf thymus (ECT), six patients (one with C 2 deficiency, four with C 4 deficiency and one with C 1 q deficiency) had anti-Ro (SS-A) antibodies with or without anti-ECT antibodies.

40|$|Bullous pemphigoid (BP) {{antibodies}} are deposited predominantly in the lamina lucida in vivo; however, circulating BP antibodies bind {{in vitro}} to the cytoplasmic plaque of basal cell hemidesmosomes. We examined {{the ability of}} IgG in nine BP seta to bind to intracellular or extracellular antigen. On skin cryosections, indirect IF showed IgG bound to basement membrane zone (BMZ) and indirect ImmunoEM confirmed intracellular binding on the cytoplasmic plaque of hemidesmosomes. In contrast, when normal skin was exposed to BP serum in organ culture, direct IF showed fainter linear deposition of IgG along the BMZ, and direct ImmunoEM demonstrated extracellular IgG binding in the lamina lucida, predominantly beneath hemidesmosomes. Four of <b>nine</b> seta showed <b>complement</b> fixation on indirect IF samples (IgG bound to intracellular antigen) and three showed complement fixation on direct IF specimens (IgG bound to extracelluar antigen). Three of the <b>nine</b> sera contained <b>complement</b> fixing antibodies detectable only in antibody populations specific for intracellular or extracellular antigen. Western immunoblots showed that five of nine seta recognized a 240 -kD protein and four of nine recognized a 180 -kD protein. There was no correlation between the presence (or absence) of either band and the detection of complement fixing antibodies specific for intracellular or extracellular antigen. BP autoantibodies bind both intracellular and extracellular antigen, and IgG binding exclusively to extracellular antigen that mimics the in vivo situation can be detected by using organ culture. Complement fixation may be restricted to antibodies specific for intracellular or extracellular antigen. These findings underscore {{the complexity of the}} autoantibody-antigen system in BP and have implications regarding the proposed pathogenicity of the autoantibodies...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the <b>nine</b> {{components}} of <b>complement</b> in the serums of 16 {{members of a}} kindred have established the diagnosis of hereditary deficiency of the second component of complement (C 2). The autosomal recessive mode of inheritance resembles that of previously described families with C 2 deficiency. Both C 2 activity determinations with a stoichiometric haemolytic assay and C 2 protein measurements with electroimmunodiffusion against antibody monospecific for C 2 detect the heterozygous deficient state. Antigenic analysis, in vitro reconstitution experiments, and the constant ratio of C 2 function to C 2 protein indicate that the C 2 synthesized by heterozygotes is indistinguishable from normal human C 2. Studies of neonatal homozygous deficient serum and maternal heterozygous deficient serum show that transplacental passage of C 2 does not occur. C 2 deficiency in this family is not associated with clinical defects in host resistance...|$|R

40|$|A factor {{generated}} {{during the}} sequential {{interaction of the}} first seven of the <b>nine</b> components of <b>complement</b> (C') is chemotactic for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (1 - 3). This factor, referred to as C'(5, 6, 7) a, {{has been identified as}} the activated trimolecular complex consisting of the fifth (C' 5), sixth (C' 6), and seventh (Ct?) components of complement. C'(5, 6, 7) a mediates the selective, unidirectional migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro, and it may also be a mediator in immunologically induced acute inflammatory reactions involving vascular structures of the skin (4) and kidneys (5). In addition, a complement-assocLuted chemotactic factor can be demonstrated for brief periods of time in the plasma of rabbits following injection of zymosan (2). Organophosphorus inhibitors such as diisopropylphosphofluoridate or p-nitrophenyl ethyl phosphonates are specific, irreversible inhibitors of serine esterases. They inhibit the C'(5, 6, 7) a-induced chemotaxis of rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes by two different mechanisms (5, 7).

40|$|A {{workflow}} {{is presented}} to determine the detailed, high-resolution pattern of erosion in maturely explored Sedimentary Basins by analysing the sonic log-based interval velocity patterns of <b>nine</b> stratigraphic intervals <b>complemented</b> by a geometrical approach involving the extrapolation of 3 -D seismic reflectors. The jointly evaluated results of the two approaches not only provide important constraints on the inversion tectonics of a basin, but are also used to better constrain its maturity history and reservoir quality for geothermal energy. The developed workflow is demonstrated for the West Netherlands Basin. The pattern of erosion, {{which is consistent with}} observed subcrop maps, shows increasing amount of erosion towards the East and reflects the complex deformation of the basin, in which the reactivation of faults played a major role. Indirectly the results also indicate that continuous, syn-inversion sedimentation was taking place on the flanks of the basin during the Late Cretaceous, while its centre was characterised by non-deposition or slight erosion. For geothermal exploration the inferred variations of amount of erosion has implications for the spatial distribution of porosity which is an important parameter for the assessment of reservoir quality. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of Moloney leukemia virus {{on the surface}} of a viral-induced lymphoma cell, availability of the virus to anti-viral antibody, and {{the nature and extent of}} activation of the complement system during the cell cycle were studied in vitro. Viral antigen was present on the cell surface, accessible to antibody, and was able to activate complement in the presence of antibody throughout all cellular growth phases, while cytotoxicity was confined to the G 1 phase of cell growth. In addition, when cells were arrested in metaphase, viral antigen could be demonstrated on the cell surface by immunofluorescence, and budding virus was seen by electron microscopy. All <b>nine</b> components of <b>complement</b> were activated on the addition of antibody throughout the cell cycle. Additional experiments indicated that in the presence of antibody, C 3 and/or C 4 were immunospecifically bound to viral-induced lymphoma cells throughout the cell cycle as a result of complement activation. These results indicate that the inability to lyse the cells in the presence of specific anti-viral antibody and complement during the logarithmic phase of cell growth is not due to the lack of {{expression of}} Moloney virus antigen(s) on the cell surface, inaccessibility of this surface antigen(s) to antibody, or failure to activate the complement effector system...|$|R
40|$|The A {{component}} of the bipartite genome of the geminivirus tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) encodes the viral protein (AL 1) that is required for viral DNA replication. We have constructed transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants in which the AL 1 open reading frame is transcribed {{under the control of}} the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. The transgenic plants, which were phenotypically normal, produced a single transcript from the 35 S-AL 1 construct and a 40 -kDa protein that cross-reacted with a polyclonal antiserum raised against AL 1 protein overproduced in Escherichia coli. Six of <b>nine</b> transgenic lines <b>complemented</b> a TGMV A variant with a mutation in AL 1 when coinoculated with the B {{component of}} the TGMV genome. Single- and double-stranded forms of the B component were synthesized in leaf discs from a complementing, transgenic line in the absence of TGMV A. These results establish that the transgenic plants express functional AL 1 protein and show that this viral protein is not only required, but sufficient, for single- and double-stranded replication of TGMV DNA in the presence of host proteins. These results also show that the AL 1 protein is not by itself a determinant of disease or pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) UL 25 protein (pUL 25) is a minor capsid protein that is {{essential}} for packaging the full-length viral genome into preformed precursor capsid. It is also important in virus entry and recently has been implicated in the egress of the virus from the cell (Coller et al., 2007, Preston et al., 2008). The crystallographic structure of an N-terminally truncated form of pUL 25 (residues 134 - 580) has been determined to 2. 1 Å, revealing a protein with a novel fold that consists mostly of a-helices and a few minor b-sheets (Bowman et al., 2006). An unusual feature of the protein {{is the presence of}} numerous flexible loops extending out from the stable core and its distinctive electrostatic distribution. Five of the extended loops contain unstructured regions, L 1 -L 5, with three additional unstructured amino acids, L 6, located at the carboxyl terminus of the protein (Bowman et al., 2006). Four potentially functional clusters of residues, C 1 -C 4, were identified {{on the surface of the}} protein using evolutionary trace analysis (Lichtartge and Sowa, 2002). To examine the function of the protein in relation to its structure, site-directed mutations were engineered into the UL 25 gene in a protein expression plasmid. A series of mutant proteins was generated, each protein containing a deletion of the unstructured residues in one of the six regions, L 1 -L 6. Another set of mutant proteins were constructed with each member containing substitutions of selected amino acids within one of the four potentially functional clusters, C 1 -C 4, or substitutions of the three disordered amino acids in L 6. The amino acid substitutions were generally to alanine, but in one case where the SIFT program predicted alanine would not affect the function of the protein an alternative residue was substituted. To determine the functional significance of the uncrystallised part of pUL 25, residues 1 - 133, three deletion mutant proteins that spanned this region (pUL 25 D 1 - 45, pUL 25 D 1 - 59 and pUL 25 D 1 - 133) were included in the study. Although an existing UL 25 null mutant, KUL 25 NS, was available at the beginning of the project for analysis of the mutant proteins, it had been made by the insertion of multiple stop codons in the UL 25 ORF and as a result some UL 25 sequences were still present within the virus genome. Consequently, during complementation assays recombination between the UL 25 sequences in the KUL 25 NS genome and the transfected expression plasmid generated low levels of wild-type (wt) progeny virus. To improve the sensitivity of the assay, a new deletion mutant, ΔUL 25 MO, was created that lacked the entire UL 25 gene. This mutant failed to form plaques in non-permissive Vero cells and grew well in the complementing cell line, 8 - 1. However, contrary to previously published work, electron microscopic (EM) analysis revealed that DNA-containing capsids as well as A- and B-capsids were present in the nuclei of both ΔUL 25 MO- and KUL 25 NS-infected cells. As expected, none of the progeny from ΔUL 25 MO-infected Vero cells expressing the wt pUL 25 formed plaques on non-permissive cells. Of the 17 mutant UL 25 proteins screened in the complementation assay, <b>nine</b> failed to <b>complement</b> the growth of ΔUL 25 MO in Vero cells. Three of the non-complementing mutant proteins examined altered the phenotype of ΔUL 25 MO in a transient DNA packaging assay, allowing the mutant virus to package full-length genomes in U 2 OS cells co-infected with ΔUL 25 MO and a mammalian baculovirus vector containing the mutant UL 25 gene. These results indicate that viral assembly was disrupted in these cells following DNA packaging. However, five of the mutant proteins did not change the pattern of DNA encapsidation of ΔUL 25 MO in this system, suggesting that the wild-type residues mutated in these proteins are critical for packaging virus DNA. To determine at which point in the virus growth cycle the post-packaging blocks occurred, EM was used to investigate the pattern of virus assembly in ΔUL 25 MO-infected cells expressing either of the three packaging-competent mutant proteins. In addition, fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis was performed to establish the distribution of virus DNA in these cells. The results showed that in ΔUL 25 MO-infected cells expressing two of the mutant pUL 25 s the C-capsids failed to exit the nucleus, whereas in cells expressing the third post-packaging mutant protein C-capsids were seen in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The FISH data confirmed the EM observations. These studies show that two regions of pUL 25 are important for egress of the C-capsids from the nuclei. Since these two regions lie in close proximity to each other on the surface of the molecule they may represent a single functional interface of the protein. In addition, another region of pUL 25 was identified that was essential for the interactions required for virus assembly after the C-capsids are released into the cytoplasm. The 62 carboxyl-terminal region of the UL 36 gene product (pUL 36) has previously been shown to contain a capsid-binding domain (CBD) that interacts with pUL 25 (Coller et al., 2007). A GST-pull down assay was used to determine whether the mutations in the post-packaging mutant proteins disrupted the interaction of pUL 25 with the CBD of pUL 36. However, all of these mutant proteins and the wt pUL 25 bound to the pUL 36 CBD GST fusion protein. In summary, three different classes of pUL 25 mutants, each of which affect a different essential function of pUL 25, have been identified, revealing that pUL 25 is indeed a versatile viral protein. These mutants provide the first evidence that this DNA packaging protein is crucial for virus assembly at two different stages after DNA encapsidation, one in nuclear egress of C-capsids and the other in the assembly of the virus in the cytoplasm...|$|R
