5|$|Bounty {{had left}} England in 1787 {{on a mission}} to collect and {{transport}} breadfruit plants from Tahiti to the West Indies. A five-month layover in Tahiti, during which many of the men lived ashore and formed relationships with native Polynesians, proved harmful to discipline. Relations between Bligh and his crew deteriorated after he began handing out increasingly harsh punishments, criticism and abuse, Christian being a particular target. After three weeks back at sea, Christian and others forced Bligh from the ship. Twenty-five men remained on board afterwards, including loyalists held against their will and others for whom there was <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> the launch.|$|E
25|$|CART {{officials}} {{held out}} the possibility of rescheduling the race, but there was <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> the schedule and it was ultimately canceled. The race marked the first time a CART race had been canceled outright due to driver safety issues. The 1985 Michigan 500 was postponed six days due to concerns about Goodyear's new radial tire. After three major crashes, drivers refused to participate, and the race was run the following weekend with the old bias-ply tires.|$|E
25|$|While {{the loss}} of skilled labor {{represents}} a potential cost for countries of origin, it can also at times be beneficial. For instance, if there is <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> {{the economy of the}} home country to use the skilled labor, then it is better for the workers to migrate and send back remittances. When these remittances are greater than what the migrant would have made in the home country, it is also beneficial. Another example is when the migrants return with new skills, knowledge, and capacities. Lastly, the movement of skilled labor is beneficial for the country of origin when migrants forge strong economic connections between the home and host country.|$|E

To break Vince's spirits they began {{targeting}} his daughter Stephanie. Worried about his daughter, Vince shifted focus from his Corporation stable to Stephanie. With Vince occupied, his son Shane gradually took over the leadership of the Corporation. On April 12, Shane kicked Vince, Pat Patterson, and Gerald Brisco out of the Corporation. His rationale was that there was <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> the Corporation for the old and that Vince no longer had his priorities straight. Shane then slapped his father, saying that the strong, ruthless man he knew was gone.|$|E

The offer was accepted and the band reformed, with a line-up of Regan, Cousin, Willson-Piper, plus Ric Carter (who {{had been in the}} Mission with Cousin) on guitars/keyboards and Del Hood on drums. This line-up toured during 2000 and 2001, releasing a live album Live and Electric at the Union Chapel. In addition, Regan, Willson-Piper and Cousin toured as a pared down, mainly acoustic trio for two years, releasing live albums Fairy Light Nights in 2000, and Fairy Light Nights Volume 2 in 2001.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} when Herod was king of Judea, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth in Galilee to {{announce}} to a virgin named Mary, who was betrothed to a man named Joseph, that a child would be born {{to her and she}} was to name him Jesus, for he would be the son of God and rule over Israel forever. When the time of the birth drew near the Roman Emperor commanded a census of all the world, and Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem, the city of David, as he was of the House of David. So it came to pass that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, and as there was <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> the town the infant was laid in a manger while angels announced his birth and shepherds worshiped him as Messiah and Lord.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the season, the Australian Board of Control had issued a {{directive}} calling on the umpires to [...] "get tough" [...] in enforcing the laws of cricket, and asked the state associations to [...] "back the umpires to the fullest extent". In the lead-up to the Test, Meckiff was the centre of media attention, and one report described him as cricket's [...] "bogey man". The South Africans were reportedly stunned by Meckiff's selection, giving the impression that they considered him an illegitimate bowler. Reaction in England was also hostile, ahead of Australia's forthcoming tour in the English summer of 1964. Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie wrote in the News of the World: [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> cricket for throwers. Let us hope that...the Australian selectors realise this...otherwise the throwing war will be waged in earnest".|$|E
500|$|Meghan O'Rouke, Slate Magazines culture {{critic and}} {{advisory}} editor, ultimately found The Kite Runner mediocre, writing, [...] "This {{is a novel}} simultaneously striving to deliver a large-scale informative portrait and to stage a small-scale redemptive drama, but its therapeutic allegory of recovery can only undermine its realist ambitions. People experience their lives {{against the backdrop of}} their culture, and while Hosseini wisely steers clear of merely exoticizing Afghanistan as a monolithically foreign place, he does so much work to make his novel emotionally accessible to the American reader that there is almost <b>no</b> <b>room,</b> <b>in</b> the end, for us to consider for long what might differentiate Afghans and Americans." [...] Sarah Smith from The Guardian thought the novel started out well but began to falter towards the end. She felt that Hosseini was too focused on fully redeeming the protagonist in Part III and in doing so created too many unrealistic coincidences that allowed Amir the opportunity to undo his past wrongs.|$|E

The launch was supplied with about five days' food and water, a sextant, compass and nautical tables, and Purcell's tool chest. At the last minute the mutineers threw four cutlasses down into the boat. Of Bountys complement—44 [...] after the deaths of Huggan and Valentine—19 men [...] were [...] crowded into the launch, leaving it dangerously low in the water with only seven inches of freeboard. The 25 men remaining on Bounty included the committed mutineers who had [...] taken up arms, the loyalists detained against their will, and [...] others for whom there was <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> the launch. [...] At around 10:00 the line holding the launch to the ship was cut; a little later, Bligh ordered a sail to be raised. Their immediate destination was the nearby island of Tofua, clearly marked on the horizon by the plume of smoke rising from its volcano.|$|E

500|$|Once {{the king}} had {{declared}} the German commission unlawful, {{it became clear that}} he would never be won over. An impatient Hitler appointed a German, Josef Terboven, as the new Norwegian Reichskommissar, or Governor-General, on 24 April, reporting directly to him. Despite Hitler's assurances, Terboven {{wanted to make sure that}} there would be <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>in</b> the government for the Nasjonal Samling nor its leader Quisling, with whom he did not get along. Terboven eventually accepted a certain Nasjonal Samling presence in the government during June, but remained unconvinced about Quisling. As a result, on 25 June, Terboven forced Quisling to step down as leader of the Nasjonal Samling and take a temporary leave of absence in Germany. Quisling remained there until 20 August, while Rosenberg and Admiral Erich Raeder, whom he had met on his earlier visit to Berlin, negotiated on his behalf. In the end, Quisling returned [...] "in triumph," [...] having won Hitler over in a meeting on 16 August. The Reichskommissar would now have to accommodate Quisling as leader of the government, then allow him to rebuild the Nasjonal Samling and bring more of his men into the cabinet. Terboven complied and addressed the Norwegian people in a radio broadcast in which he asserted that the Nasjonal Samling would be the only political party allowed.|$|E
