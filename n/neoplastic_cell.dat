A total of 931 cases of NSCLC were analyzed for EGFR mutational status (exon 18, 19, 20, 21) using Next Generation Sequencer. The percentage of mutated <b>neoplastic</b> <b>cells</b> was calculated after normalizing the percentage of mutated alleles obtained after next generation sequencer analysis with the percentage of <b>neoplastic</b> <b>cells</b> in each tumor.

To analyze the <b>neoplastic</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation rate, the Ki- 67 labelling index was determined; the latter was significantly different between normal epithelium and various grades of CIN (p > 0. 0001).

The <b>neoplastic</b> <b>cells</b> were predominantly arranged in solid sheets, but they also formed blood-filled cancellous structures, and proliferating foci were seen around blood vessels. Periodic acid-Schiff reaction demonstrated that a fine basement membrane-like structure surrounded the <b>neoplastic</b> <b>cells.</b> Immunohistochemically, the <b>neoplastic</b> <b>cells</b> were positive for vimentin and alpha smooth muscle actin and negative for cytokeratin, factor VIII-related antigen, chromogranin and desmin. Based on its histopathological features, the hepatic neoplasm was diagnosed as a primary glomus tumor. This is the first report about a primary glomus tumor of the liver in a cow. [URL]...|$|R
