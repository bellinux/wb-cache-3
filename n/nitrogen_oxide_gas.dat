Instead of structural changes {{which are more}} difficult and expensive, development of fuel technologies is preferred to provide reduction on exhaust gas emissions which are harmful to environment and human health. Therefore, in this experimental study, anisole was used as additive into diesel fuel with the volumetric ratio of 1, 5 %, 3 % and 5 %. The performance characteristics and exhaust emissions of a four cylinder, four stroke, naturally aspirated, water cooled, direct injection compression ignition engine fueled with modified fuels were analyzed.

40|$|Quorum sensing (QS) is a {{widespread}} process in bacteria used to coordinate gene expression with cell density, diffusion dynamics, and spatial distribution through the production of diffusible chemical signals. To date, most studies on QS have focused on model bacteria that are amenable to genetic manipulation and capable of high growth rates, but many environmentally important bacteria have been overlooked. For example, representatives of proteobacteria that participate in nitrification, the aerobic oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite, produce QS signals called acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs). Nitrification emits nitrogen oxide gases (NO, NO 2, and N 2 O), which are potentially hazardous compounds that contribute to global warming. Despite considerable interest in nitrification, the purpose of QS in the physiology/ecology of nitrifying bacteria is poorly understood. Through a quorum quenching approach, we investigated the role of QS in a well-studied AHL-producing nitrite oxidizer, Nitrobacter winogradskyi. We added a recombinant AiiA lactonase to N.  winogradskyi cultures to degrade AHLs to prevent their accumulation and to induce a QS-negative phenotype and then used mRNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq) to identify putative QS-controlled genes. Our transcriptome analysis showed that expression of nirK and nirK cluster genes (ncgABC) increased up to 19. 9 -fold under QS-proficient conditions (minus active lactonase). These data led to us to query if QS influenced <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>gas</b> fluxes in N.  winogradskyi. Production and consumption of NOx increased and production of N 2 O decreased under QS-proficient conditions.

40|$|Turbulent lean {{premixed}} combustion {{has high}} potentials {{for the development}} of modern low <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>gas</b> turbines. However, it renders the combustor prone to combustion instabilities. The non-linear response of turbulent premixed flame to external acoustic forcing plays a dominant {{role in the development of}} combustion instability. The present work describes a numerical study investigating the two frequency effects on the non-linear responses and interactions of lean premixed ethylene/air flame externally forced by strong inlet velocity oscillations. The target case is a bluff body stabilized premixed turbulent flame. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is performed using a low-Mach number solver based on the open source CFD toolbox, OpenFOAM. The lean combustion is modelled using the Partially Stirred Reactor (PaSR) combustion model combining a reduced two-step chemical reaction mechanism. Both the unforced and forced reactive flows with single frequency forcing are simulated in order to validate the computational method. On the basis, the velocity oscillations are introduced at the inlet with two frequencies, namely the primary frequency of f 1 = 160 Hz and the harmonic frequency of f 2 = 320 Hz. The introduction of second harmonic frequency is found to change the heat release rate fluctuation significantly. With two frequency forcing, the amplitudes of heat release responses at the primary frequency are reduced significantly, up to 70 % less than those with single frequency forcing. Also the phase values are reduced/increased a lot depending on the level of second harmonic forcing. At the same time, the heat release rate fluctuations are also reduced responding at the harmonic forcing except one case where both the forcing amplitudes of the two frequencies are small. The physical mechanisms are found to be highly related to the vortex flow structures during the acoustic forcing. The central recirculation region and the side recirculation region which generates the flame shear layers in between have different responses to the acoustic forcing depending on the frequencies and amplitudes. This work implies that LES, in this case via OpenFOAM, can be used to study the heat release responses and flame dynamics in complex cases of combustion instability, such as with two frequency forcing, with good accuracy...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of a research program to investigate air staging applied to swirling flames, an experimental investigation aimed at studying pollutant emissions is reported. Staged combustion is accepted as an effective way to reduce <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> in <b>gas</b> turbine combustors and, in the present study, is applied to a swirled flame fuelled by natural gas, to analyse the potential for further reducing <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> emissions in a coaxial, non-premixed combustor under overall lean conditions. The results indicate that the full benefits of air staged combustion in swirling flames depend mainly on the method of fuel injection. The most common method of axial injection of a premixed jet into a co-axial swirling airflow does not realize the required fast mixing. By radial injection of the premixed first stage in the secondary co-axial airflow, more efficient and faster centrifugal mixing is achieved, and hence shorter residence time and higher combustion intensity.
