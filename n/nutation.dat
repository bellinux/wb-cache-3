5|$|This adds a {{periodic}} component {{to the position}} of the equinoxes; the positions of the celestial equator and (vernal) equinox with fully updated precession and <b>nutation</b> are called the true equator and equinox; the positions without <b>nutation</b> are the mean equator and equinox.|$|E
5|$|Once again, {{this is a}} simplification. Periodic {{motions of}} the Moon and {{apparent}} periodic motions of the Sun (actually of Earth in its orbit) cause short-term small-amplitude periodic oscillations of Earth's axis, and hence the celestial equator, known as <b>nutation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Ethylene {{influences}} many {{processes in}} Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) through {{the action of}} five receptor isoforms. We used high-resolution, time-lapse imaging of dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings {{to better understand the}} roles of each isoform in the regulation of growth in air, ethylene-stimulated <b>nutations,</b> and growth recovery after ethylene removal. We found that ETHYLENE RECEPTOR 1 (ETR 1) is both necessary and sufficient for <b>nutations.</b> Transgene constructs in which the ETR 1 promoter was used to drive expression of cDNAs for each of the five receptor isoforms were transferred into etr 1 - 6;etr 2 - 3;ein 4 - 4 triple loss-of-function mutants that have constitutive growth inhibition in air, fail to nutate in ethylene, and take longer to recover a normal growth rate when ethylene is removed. The patterns of rescue show that ETR 1, ETR 2, and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 4 (EIN 4) have the prominent roles in rapid growth recovery after removal of ethylene whereas ETR 1 was the sole isoform that rescued <b>nutations.</b> ETR 1 histidine kinase activity and phosphotransfer through the receiver domain are not required to rescue <b>nutations.</b> However, REVERSION TO SENSITIVITY 1 modulates ethylene-stimulated <b>nutations</b> but does not modulate the rate of growth recovery after ethylene removal. Several chimeric receptor transgene constructs where domains of EIN 4 were swapped into ETR 1 were also introduced into the triple mutant. The pattern of phenotype rescue by the chimeric receptors used in this study supports a model where a receptor with a receiver domain is required for normal growth recovery and that <b>nutations</b> specifically require the full-length ETR 1 receptor...|$|R
40|$|The {{anomalous}} {{behavior of}} transient <b>nutations</b> is experimentally investigated {{in a set}} of two-level (S= 1 / 2) spin systems differing only in spin concentration. Our results show that the non-Bloch power dependence of the decay rate of transient <b>nutations</b> is a concentration-dependent effect, which is more and more pronounced in more and mon concentrated samples. The experimental results are interpreted in the framework of the recent theory by Shakhmuratov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 2963 (1997) ] and support the hypothesis that the anomalous decay of transient <b>nutations</b> in solids originates from radiation-induced changes of the dipolar field, rather than from residual fluctuations of the nominally coherent field.

40|$|We {{have further}} {{analysed}} data from an experiment performed in satellite orbit, in Spacelab- 1. In micro-gravity the hypocotyls of Helianthus annuus, cv. "Teddy Bear", showed short period circumnutations (periods around 30 minutes) {{as well as}} the already reported long period <b>nutations</b> (with an average period of about 115 minutes). We applied various types of signal analysis (Fourier and wavelet analysis) to the data series. The long period circumnutations have a larger amplitude than the short term circumnutations. Both short and long period circumnutations exist in one and the same hypocotyl. (This is in contrast to our ground control experiments, where were found only the long-period <b>nutations.)</b> The period of the <b>nutations</b> changed throughout the experiment. These results are extending the conclusions drawn after the Spacelab experiment (Brown et al. 1990). In particular they emphasize the existence of both short- and long-period circumnutations in micro-gravity...|$|R
5|$|The exact instants of {{equinoxes}} or solstices are {{the times}} when the apparent ecliptic longitude (including the effects of aberration and <b>nutation)</b> of the Sun is 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.

5|$|This {{provides}} a definition {{for the moment}} of inertia, which is the rotational equivalent for mass. In more advanced treatments of mechanics, where the rotation over a time interval is described, the moment of inertia must be substituted by the tensor that, when properly analyzed, fully determines the characteristics of rotations including precession and <b>nutation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of the precessional {{motion of}} the equinox, the {{ecliptic}} coordinates of objects on the celestial sphere are continuously changing. Specifying a position in ecliptic coordinates requires specifying a particular equinox, that is, the equinox of a particular date, known as an epoch; the coordinates are referred to {{the direction of the}} equinox at that date. For instance, the Astronomical Almanac lists the heliocentric position of Mars at 0h Terrestrial Time, 4 Jan 2010 as: longitude 118° 09' 15".8, latitude +1° 43' 16".7, true heliocentric distance 1.6302454 AU, mean equinox and ecliptic of date. This specifies the mean equinox of 4 Jan 2010 0h TT as above, without the addition of <b>nutation.</b>|$|E

We simulate the use of time deviations of altimetry crossover positions to infer information on the <b>nutations</b> of Mars and on the librations of Mercury.

The simulations demonstrate that the use of crossover data improves the estimates of the observed libration amplitude and obliquity of Mercury and allows detecting the <b>nutations</b> of Mars...|$|R

40|$|We {{extend the}} Keldysh {{formulation}} to quantum spin systems and derive exact equations of motion.

Chief amongst these are <b>nutations</b> of single S= 1 / 2 spins in Josephson junctions. These <b>nutations</b> are triggered by the superconducting pairing correlations in the leads. Similarly, we find that on rather universal grounds, magnets display unconventional spin wave dynamics when placed in Josephson junctions. These lead to modifications in the tunneling current.

25|$|These {{expressions}} are for {{the so-called}} mean obliquity, that is, the obliquity free from short-term variations. Periodic motions of the Moon and of Earth in its orbit cause much smaller (9.2 arcseconds) short-period (about 18.6 years) oscillations of the rotation axis of Earth, known as <b>nutation,</b> which add a periodic component to Earth's obliquity. The true or instantaneous obliquity includes this <b>nutation.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{collapse}} and revival shape of Rabi oscillations {{of a single}} Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center electron spin has been observed in diamond at room temperature. Because of hyperfine interaction between the host 14 N nuclear spin and NV center electron spin, different orientation of the 14 N nuclear spin leads to a triplet splitting of the transition between the ground ms= 0 and excited states ms= 1. Microwave can excite the three transitions equally to induce three independent <b>nutations</b> and the shape of Rabi oscillations {{is a combination of}} the three <b>nutations.</b> This result provides an innovative view of electron spin oscillations in diamond.

40|$|This paper computes {{the effects}} of the solid inner core (IC) on the forced <b>nutations</b> and earth tides, and on certain of the earth's {{rotational}} normal modes. The theoretical results are extended to include {{the effects of}} a solid IC and of nonhydrostatic structure. The presence of the IC is responsible for a new, almost diurnal, prograde normal mode which involves a relative rotation between the IC and fluid outer core about an equatorial axis. It is shown that the small size of the IC's effects on both <b>nutations</b> and tides is a consequence {{of the fact that the}} IC's moments of inertia are less than 1 / 1000 of the entire earth's...|$|R
40|$|Rabi {{oscillations}} {{describe the}} interaction of a two-level system with a rotating electromagnetic field. As such, they serve as the principle method for manipulating quantum bits. By {{using a combination of}} femtosecond laser pulses and microwave excitations, we have observed the classical form of Rabi <b>nutations</b> in a ferromagnetic system whose equations of motion mirror the case of a precessing quantum two-level system. Key to our experiments is the selection of a subset of spins that is in resonance with the microwave excitation and whose coherence time is thereby extended. Taking advantage of Gilbert damping, the relaxation times are further increased such that mode-locking takes place. The observation of such Rabi <b>nutations</b> is the first step towards potential applications based on phase-coherent spin manipulation in ferromagnets...|$|R
25|$|Bradley and Molyneux {{discussed}} several hypotheses in {{the hope}} of finding the solution. Since the apparent motion was evidently caused neither by parallax nor observational errors, Bradley first hypothesized that it could be due to oscillations in the orientation of the Earth's axis relative to the celestial sphere– a phenomenon known as <b>nutation.</b> 35 Camelopardalis was seen to possess an apparent motion which could be consistent with <b>nutation,</b> but since its declination varied only one half as much as that of γ Draconis, it was obvious that <b>nutation</b> did not supply the answer (however, Bradley later went on to discover that the Earth does indeed nutate). He also investigated the possibility that the motion was due to an irregular distribution of the Earth's atmosphere, thus involving abnormal variations in the refractive index, but again obtained negative results.|$|E

40|$|Ethylene {{influences}} {{the growth and}} development of plants through the action of receptors that have homology to bacterial two-component receptors. In bacteria these receptors function via autophosphorylation of a His residue in the kinase domain followed by phosphotransfer to a conserved Asp residue in a response regulator protein. In Arabidopsis, {{two of the five}} receptor isoforms are capable of His kinase activity. However, the role of His kinase activity and phosphotransfer is unclear in ethylene signaling. A previous study showed that ethylene stimulates <b>nutations</b> of the hypocotyl in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings that are dependent on the ETR 1 receptor isoform. The ETR 1 receptor is the only isoform in Arabidopsis that contains both a functional His kinase domain and a receiver domain for phosphotransfer.

25|$|The Earth's {{rotation}} axis {{moves with}} respect to the fixed stars (inertial space); the components of this motion are precession and <b>nutation.</b> It also moves {{with respect to}} the Earth's crust; this is called polar motion.|$|E
25|$|Precession is a {{rotation}} of the Earth's rotation axis, caused primarily by external torques from {{the gravity of the}} Sun, Moon and other bodies. The polar motion is primarily due to free core <b>nutation</b> and the Chandler wobble.|$|E

50|$|This polar motion {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the changing direction of the Earth's spin axis relative to the stars with different periods, caused mostly by the torques on the Geoid due to the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun.

Transfer of the initial electron polarization to nuclear spins has been studied {{in the presence of}} radiofrequency excitation; the experiments have been performed with different pulse sequences using different doped molecular systems. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the dominant role of coherent mechanisms of spin order transfer, which manifest themselves in well pronounced oscillations. These oscillations are of two types, precessions and <b>nutations,</b> having characteristic frequencies, which are the same for the different molecular systems and the pulse sequences applied. Hence, precessions and <b>nutations</b> constitute a general feature of polarization transfer in ONP experiments.

It is predicted that beat oscillations of the spin <b>nutations</b> and not the <b>nutations</b> themselves dominate the transport or recombination rates when the exchange coupling strength or the field strength of the exciting radiation exceed the difference of the Zeeman energies within the spin pair. Furthermore, while the intensities of the rate oscillations decrease with increasing exchange within the spin pairs, the singlet and triplet signals retain their relative strength.
