500|$|Two critics from Pitchfork Media {{reviewed}} [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{separately from}} Night Time, My Time. Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth-best song released in 2013. She spoke favorably of its lyrical content, commending the chorus lyrics [...] "How could {{you know what}} it feels like to fight the hounds of hell?" [...] and [...] "You think you know me so well" [...] for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for [...] "bullied high school weirdos", and appreciating that the lines [...] "I know it's <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> / That you don't understand / I blame myself" [...] for acknowledging her own wrongdoings with the intention of starting anew. Jillian Mapes complimented the [...] "bluntness" [...] that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had [...] "anthem potential". She praised the verses for verbalizing self-confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines [...] "I’m just a face without a choice / Trust you’d never like to guess what I think above the shoulders." [...] She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a [...] "declaration of force [...] a song about the power of vulnerability" [...] rather than confusing it for an [...] "admission of weakness".|$|E
2500|$|Republican Presidential {{candidate}} Duncan Hunter {{called the}} report [...] "a candid, independent assessment given with integrity". Republican Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona stated that [...] "I commend General Petraeus for his honest and forthright {{assessment of the}} situation in Iraq." [...] Anti-war Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska criticized the report while praising Petraeus, saying [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> general.... It's not Ambassador Crocker's fault. It's this administration's fault." [...] A USA Today/Gallup poll taken after Petraeus's report to Congress showed virtually no change in public opinion toward the war. A Pew Research Center survey found that most Americans who have heard about the report approve of Petraeus's recommendations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't think I am blaming {{you in the}} least; it is <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> it is Fate. Keep {{to moral}} advice and criticism--there you are {{distinctly}} good; but don't try your hand any more on 'Useful Information.' As I have said, it is <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> Your information is correct enough--there {{is nothing to be}} said against that; it simply is that you are not lucky with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, dearest. It has <b>not</b> been <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> nor do I {{think that}} it has been mine. I think we'd better not talk of faults. Ah dear;--I do wish he had never come here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It shall <b>not</b> be <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> You shall {{know nothing}} of it. I will find my way. Ah! I'm a giddy young thing. Nothing can stop me!' and she stepped forward, {{laughing}} affectedly, and trying to look arch.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} I've met {{many young men}} with nerve enough to do that, but I think you're right," [...] he said. [...] "I was pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Ingleby--and it is, perhaps, <b>not</b> {{altogether}} <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> that the present unfortunate circumstances must necessarily lead to a temporary break in it." ...|$|R
60|$|JAWBONES [He {{takes the}} tray from her.] <b>Not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> Tell 'im I {{took it from}} you by brute force.|$|E
6000|$|Henrietta {{seemed a}} little troubled. She smiled faintly, and said caressingly, [...] "It was <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> Sidney. I don't blame you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” he said, “it’s <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> you’re not Americans. Rustle. Hay prisa. Adelante! Tell them I’ll {{put this}} {{contract}} through, Appleby.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gerald," [...] said Mrs. Lyddell, [...] "that is no proper {{manner of}} speaking; you have behaved very ill already--do <b>not</b> add to <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> Before any more is said, beg Miss Morley's pardon." ...|$|R
5000|$|If you've {{nothing to}} say, say it {{any way you}} like. Stylistic innovations, contorted story lines or none, exotic or genderless pronouns, {{internal}} inconsistencies, the recipe for preparing your lover as a cannibal banquet: feel free. If {{what you have to}} say is important and/or difficult to follow, use the simplest language possible. If the reader doesn't get it then, let it <b>not</b> be <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{drew his}} chair nearer to her, {{and took her}} by the hand. But she, {{disengaging}} hers, parted the hair from off his forehead, and kissed his brow. [...] "Oh, Frank," [...] she said, [...] "I have been so proud of you, am still so proud of you. It will send me to my grave if I see you sink below <b>your</b> proper position. <b>Not</b> that it will be <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> I am sure it will <b>not</b> be <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> Only circumstanced as you are, you should be doubly, trebly, careful. If your father had not--" ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. GWYN. [With sudden tenderness.] It's <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> dear. I {{ought to}} have known how it would be. Well, let's go in! ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY (sweetly). It was <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> was it? I'm so glad you're {{not angry}} with me any longer, lieutenant. (She offers her hand.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm sure it's <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> Mrs Hurtle. When a {{marriage}} is to be, and doesn't come off, it never is the lady's fault.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is because}} I do <b>not</b> think <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> lies that way. If it did, or if I thought so, my Telemachus, {{you may be}} sure that I should resign my {{position}} as Mentor. Here are Mr. Kennedy and Lady Glencora and Mrs. Gresham on the steps." [...] Then they went up through the Ionic columns on to the broad stone terrace before the door, and there they found a crowd of men and women. For the legislators and statesmen had written their letters, and the ladies had taken their necessary rest.|$|R
6000|$|... "How has it happened, nurse? Stop {{crying and}} tell us. I {{am sure that}} it could <b>not</b> have been <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> for you are always so careful with him. There is no {{occasion}} to be so terribly upset. Of course he will soon be found. The first policeman who sees him will be sure {{to take him to}} the station. Now how did it happen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{must tell}} you in particular, Mr. Harding, that you are much to blame. Several hundred persons have enquired at your house for my [...] "Letter to the Shopkeepers, &c." [...] and you had none to sell them. Pray keep {{yourself}} provided with that letter, and with this; you have got very well by the former, but I did not then write for your sake, any more than I do now. Pray advertise both in every newspaper, and let it <b>not</b> be <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> or mine, if our countrymen will not take warning. I desire you likewise to sell them as cheap as you can.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{suffering}} too acutely {{to write}} more. May {{you never know}} what my withdrawal from our engagement has cost me! I beg you will not blame yourself. It is <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> that I have had all my energies misdirected by others--it is <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> that I have never had a fair chance of getting on in life. Forget the deserted wretch who breathes his heartfelt prayers for your happiness, and who will ever remain your friend and well-wisher.|$|E
6000|$|... "No better? no, sir, nor 'tis <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> if ever she be. You've {{been and}} frought her nigh {{to death with}} your terrifying ways." ...|$|E
6000|$|GRACE (firmly). It is <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> in the least, Mr. Charteris. Dr. Paramore: {{will you}} oblige me by finding Sylvia Craven for me, if you can? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It may <b>not</b> be <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> Horace,' she said, 'if your {{nature is}} {{incapable}} of comprehending what is great and generous in other natures higher than yours. But the least {{you can do is}} to distrust your own capacity of appreciation. For the future keep your opinions (on questions which you don't understand) modestly to yourself. I have a tenderness for you for your father's sake; and I take the most favorable view of your conduct toward Mercy Merrick. I humanely consider it the conduct of a fool.' (Her own words, Miss Roseberry. I assure you once more, her own words.) 'But don't trespass too far on my indulgence--don't insinuate again that a woman who is good enough (if she died this night) to go to heaven, is not good enough to be my nephew's wife.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I did not summon {{you that}} we might discuss European geography," [...] {{interrupted}} Pesita. [...] "I sent for you {{to tell you that}} the stranger would not consent to serve me unless I liberated his friend, the gringo, and that sneaking spy of a Miguel. I was forced to yield, for we can use the stranger. So I have promised, my dear captain, that I shall send them upon their road with a safe escort in the morning, and you shall command the guard. Upon your life respect my promise, Rozales; but if some of Villa's cutthroats should fall upon you, and in the battle, while you were trying to defend the gringo and Miguel, both should be slain by the bullets of the Villistas--ah, but it would be deplorable, Rozales, but it would <b>not</b> be <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> Who, indeed, could blame you who had fought well and risked your men and yourself in the performance of your sacred duty? Rozales, should such a thing occur what could I do in token of my great pleasure other than make you a colonel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} {{better than you}} think," [...] she said. [...] "But Tom has <b>not</b> <b>your</b> excuse. And if he had only <b>your</b> <b>faults</b> I would say nothing. He does not care for those he should, and he is forever in the green-room of the theatre." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it can't {{be helped}} now," [...] said Brooke, philosophically. [...] "I suppose it's <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> you're such an ass. Anyhow, come on now. It's struck eight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> that I wouldn't take a hint," [...] he {{answered}} quietly. [...] "But {{you are very}} young; and I knew that I would never change." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a swindle!" [...] {{burst in}} Matt Lincoln indignantly. [...] "Don't {{you pay a}} cent. Miss Bartlett. It was <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> and he cannot force you to pay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know yourself, Huron, how {{one of them}} fell. I saw it, and you all saw it, too. 'Twas too bloody to look at; but it was <b>not</b> Deerslayer's <b>fault.</b> <b>Your</b> warrior sought his life, and {{he defended}} himself. I don't know whether this good book says that it was right, but all men will do that. Come, {{if you want to}} know which of you can shoot best, give Deerslayer a rifle, and then you will find how much more expert he is than any of your warriors; yes, than all of them together!" ...|$|R
60|$|Queen. Some {{people may}} speak ill, and yet mean well: Remember {{you were not}} confined; and yet <b>Your</b> <b>fault</b> was great. In short, I love him, And that excuses all; but be not jealous; His rising shall <b>not</b> be <b>your</b> overthrow, Nor will I ever marry him.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{imprudent}} of you, Gertrude!" [...] she said. [...] "Not {{that it is}} <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> {{more than}} mine. I ought to have stopped you, but I did <b>not</b> think <b>your</b> voice would be heard through that thick curtain. Who are you, sir, {{and where do you}} come from?" [...] she asked, turning to Ned.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> {{so much as}} that of {{some one}} else,' said John. 'Some one who {{declares}} smoking cigars in his den down-stairs refreshes him more than a sensible walk.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My children," [...] said he, [...] "this {{is clearly}} <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> I {{recognize}} in this insult and irreverence only {{the fault of}} your immediate progenitors. Let us pray for your immediate progenitors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but that}} is <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> little one. I will make it all right with her, don't you fret. Come on, we had better go home and change {{it as soon as}} possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} it was <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> Tom," [...] Mrs. Ellison said sharply--"very much <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> if you throw a great stone at a bird without taking care {{to see what it}} may hit. But that is nothing to <b>your</b> <b>fault</b> in letting another boy be punished for what you did. I shall report the matter to the squire, and he will speak to your father about it. You are a wicked, bad boy.|$|R
60|$|Captain. But allowing, my dear sir, {{that you}} care <b>not</b> for <b>your</b> {{personal}} reputation, {{or for that}} of any literary person upon whose shoulders <b>your</b> <b>faults</b> may be visited, allow me to say, that common gratitude to the public, which has received you so kindly, and to the critics, who have treated you so leniently, ought to induce you to bestow more pains on your story.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{that it was}} <b>your</b> <b>fault.</b> Now {{when any}} person commits a fault," [...] {{continued}} Wallace, [...] "he ought to confine the evil consequences of it to himself, {{as much as he}} can. Have the evil consequences of <b>your</b> <b>fault,</b> extended yet to any other people, do you think?" ...|$|R
