5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's <b>newel</b> posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical <b>newel</b> posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} floor of the home the rooms remain much the same as they were when Glidden lived in the house. An {{original}} multi-paneled wooden door remains at the entry from the porch to the central hall. The door, however, was altered, having glass panels installed to admit more light. The staircase is also original and its <b>newel</b> posts resemble those found in the Isaac and Harriet Ellwood House, another Haish designed home, and the Gurler House, whose architect is unknown though it was quite possibly Haish, both in DeKalb.|$|E
5|$|The entry hall {{is almost}} entirely {{original}} construction. Nearly all the woodwork and decoration in this area dates to the 180005 period, {{with the exception of}} several balusters and <b>newel</b> posts on the spiral staircase, which were Victorian replacements. The major change to the entry hall was the construction of false walls, allowing the conversion of the original hinged doors into sliding doors. The second floor central hall and Washington Room (on the second floor, in the southeast corner) were also changed very little in the renovation.|$|E
5000|$|Handrails may be {{continuous}} (sometimes called over-the-post) or post-to-post (or {{more accurately}} [...] "newel-to-newel"). For continuous handrails on long balconies, {{there may be}} multiple <b>newels</b> and tandem caps to cover the <b>newels.</b> At corners, there are quarter-turn caps. For post-to-post systems, the <b>newels</b> project above the handrails.|$|R
50|$|Inside the {{original}} layout remains mostly intact. Walls are finished in {{the original}} lath and plaster. A stair with metal <b>newels</b> and turned balusters connects all floors.|$|R
50|$|The Stair Hall {{also has}} several moulded plaster archways. The {{polished}} cedar stair has moulded square balusters, carved <b>newels</b> and a panelled spandrel beneath. The stair is dog-legged, with leadlight windows to the landing.|$|R
5|$|The keep has {{a central}} <b>newel</b> staircase, linking the basement, ground and first floors. When first built, the {{garrison}} would have {{lived on the}} ground floor of the keep, the first floor being used by the captain, and the basement for stores. The ground floor is subdivided by radial walls and originally would have been further subdivided by partitions; the original ovens and fireplace survive. The first floor mainly dates from the 1720s, although some Tudor elements remain. There is a wooden lantern structure on the top of the keep that contains a bell dating from 1655 and early 18th-century graffiti. The keep's gun embrasures were converted to form sash windows in the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and <b>newel</b> posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
5|$|Cullompton Manor House is a grade II* listed {{building}} with sections built in 1603 (dated panel and initials TT for Thomas Trock {{on the top}} corner of {{the front of the}} house) and 1718 (on a lead cistern head of a drainpipe, are the letters (L) S/WT (R) and the date 1718). It was originally a private residence and now forms part of the Manor House Hotel. It has a jettied half timbered front with four gables and stone end walls with upper windows on carved brackets. It was probably built in the sixteenth century but was refurbished in 1603 for Thomas Trock, a clothier. The original structure consisted only of the front part, in which there were three rooms and a passage on the ground floor, three rooms opening into each other on the floor above, and above again. The front room on the left was the former hall with large oak panels of the Queen Anne period, and a moulded and beamed ceiling. Part of an earlier <b>newel</b> stair which descended to the hall or kitchen survives above a back staircase. The house was remodelled in 1718 for William Sellock. At the front of the building is a hooded shell porch of the early 18th century supported on pilasters and the back of house is also early 18th century of red and blue brick, with windows with thick glazing bars beneath a hipped slate roof with coved eaves. It was given the name of The Manor House in 1850 by J. S. Upcott who owned the property at that time. During World War II it was requisitioned by the army and used to billet officers. The adjacent house, Veryards, was originally a separate residence but was bought by the owners of the Manor House Hotel and incorporated into the hotel in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|P. B. and H. Moulding Company was {{established}} in 1891. By 1894, Joseph S. Caldwell, Planing and Moulding Mill was in business at 247 Tallman Street. The company manufactured stair rails, <b>newels,</b> balusters, wood mantels and plinth blocks.|$|R
50|$|On {{the east}} of the main hall is the stairs, much of which are original. It has square <b>newels</b> and a simple molded {{handrail}} with simple square balusters. The original pine stair treads were protected by carpeting for many years.|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} is a Dutch {{door with a}} glass transom. It leads into a large central hall with a prominent staircase. Its bannister and <b>newels</b> reflect the Arts and Crafts style; all the other woodwork {{in the house is}} Colonial Revival.|$|R
25|$|Partridge {{attempted}} {{to implement the}} full law of consecration in Thompson; however, disagreements broke out and he was unsuccessful. Shortly after, Smith announced a revelation directing <b>Newel</b> Knight to lead the saints on the Copley farm to settle in Missouri.|$|E
25|$|Inside, {{the rear}} {{stairway}} {{has a large}} carved <b>newel</b> post. Both parlors have Neoclassical black marble mantels that were preserved from an earlier building. Two later black marble mantels are in the reception room, which has a carved Louis XVI-style wooden screen supported by four Corinthian columns.|$|E
25|$|A paneled {{wooden door}} inside an entry with architrave, transom and {{sidelights}} in the westernmost bay {{leads to an}} entrance hall. The interior has been remodeled but retains some original features, most notably the staircase in that entrance hall. It has a turned mahogany <b>newel</b> post, round railing, and turned balusters.|$|E
50|$|Four square pillars {{support the}} full-height front porch. Inside, {{there is little}} {{original}} hardware or woodwork.

50|$|Some CNC hot-wire cutters offer lathe attachments, {{which can}} be used with either {{stretched}} or preformed wire. Lathe attachments allow cutting of spiral shapes, and are often used to create concrete forms for ornamental and structural items, such as planters and stairway balusters and <b>newels.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the front}} parlor the {{fireplace}} has its original wooden mantelpiece and chimney breast. The rear has been reconfigured, with some doors and walls removed. Upstairs is another original <b>newel</b> post, {{and some of}} the original lath and plaster on the walls. The basement has also been modified, but may have contained the original kitchen and dining room.|$|E
25|$|The main {{entrance}} uses an arched Gibbs-style surround. The building's trim materials {{show up in}} the form of solid stone balustrades that curl to form <b>newel</b> posts at the sidewalk, and terra cotta quoins. The rear facade is less detailed, with terra cotta used only for the coping of the stepped cornice; stone and brick are used everywhere else.|$|E
25|$|One month later, on September 8, Rigdon was excommunicated {{from the}} church by a Common Council of the Church which had been convened by Presiding Bishop <b>Newel</b> K. Whitney. Rigdon refused to attend this trial after which he, in turn, {{likewise}} excommunicated {{the members of the}} Twelve. Rigdon fled Nauvoo, claiming that he felt threatened by Young's supporters.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has a dog leg stair, rising from a ground floor hall off the Logan Road entrance, {{in which a}} plaster archway supported on reeded piers separates the stairwell from the entrance. The stair features turned and moulded <b>newels,</b> surmounted by globular finials, and turned balusters.|$|R
50|$|At {{the north}} end is the raised pulpit, in a niche between paired pilasters below a {{semi-circular}} pediment. The stairs to the choir loft have S-curved <b>newels</b> at either end. The wooden Gothic Revival case for the church's original pipe organ is along the loft's south wall.|$|R

25|$|A simple {{staircase}} {{with square}} balusters, turned <b>newel</b> post and molded rail {{rises from the}} central hall to the second story. The balustrade continues along the stairwell in the second floor hallway. Like the first floor, many original finishes remain. A door in the hallway conceals a short stair to the attic, which also mostly remains as it was originally constructed. Modern metal suspension rods {{have been added to}} support the ceiling, and one of the original wooden tie beams has been replaced with a metal one.|$|E
25|$|The one-room {{interior}} of the Charles Sweeney Cabin has a loft accessible in the northwest corner by a dog-leg stairway. The stairway has many of its original balusters. It also has original trim on the stringers, the structural member of the stairway that supports the treads and risers. The square <b>newel</b> and rail are formed from one piece of an oak branch. There is a small closet under the staircase that has its original four-paneled door with concave, quarter-circle corners on the raised panels.|$|E
25|$|BYU's Special Collections {{contains}} a premiere collection of Mormon Americana, including almanacs, maps, hymnals, books, etc. These collections were originally compiled from the personal libraries of Heber J. Grant, J. Reuben Clark, <b>Newel</b> K. Whitney, James E. Talmage. The Western and Mormon Americana collections were later {{expanded to include}} parts of the personal libraries of LeRoy Hafen, Wilford Paulson, and Dale Morgan. This collection contains rare publications like the 1830 Book of Mormon, the Morning Star, Book of Commandments 1833, and 1st Mormon hymnal 1835.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{entrance}} stair {{was an important}} component of the building and the French polishing section of the building specification referring to the stair handrails, <b>newels</b> and panelling states that [...] "great care to be taken to show off the timber and panels to best advantage".|$|R

5000|$|Internally the {{fittings}} {{and details}} {{are described as}} being [...] "typically Douglas", although they are in pine rather than in his usual oak. The principal feature is the stair hall and staircase. The latter has balusters and <b>newels</b> and it leads by a quarter-turn to an arcaded landing.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the hall was the Waterloo Staircase. It was installed by the 1st Marquess after the battle in 1815. The staircase was situated {{to the right of}} the upper part of the entrance hall. It had 15 carved <b>newel</b> posts which were surmounted by openwork carved oak lanterns and balustrades. The staircase was bought by Edward and Ursula Hayward and removed to Carrick Hill, Australia in 1935, where it was reassembled and is now on public display. Carrick Hill House also has certain fireplace and panelling on display which were once park of Beaudesert.|$|E
25|$|Edward Partridge {{became the}} first man called {{to the office of}} bishop in the early Latter Day Saint church on February 4, 1831. The duties of the office were to oversee the {{temporal}} affairs and accounts of the church through the implementation of the law of consecration. Partridge was called to preside over the Missouri church in Joseph Smith's absence and soon thereafter Partridge and his family emigrated to the church's growing colony in Jackson County, Missouri, where he continued to act as bishop of the branch of the church. <b>Newel</b> K. Whitney was then called as a bishop to oversee the temporal affairs of the church in Kirtland, Ohio.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is a very rare example of a complete small medieval country house, an oblong structure on two floors, the upper floor containing a hall, solar and bedroom, while the lower floor for servants had no internal means of reaching the upper floor, to which access was only obtained by a <b>newel</b> staircase in a turret with only an external entrance. The house, obviously designed for a person of refinement, had unusually good sanitation {{in the form of}} two garderobes; the wooden chutes were still in existence in the early 20th century. The siting of the garderobes here facing the church reinforces the idea that this was considered the rear of the house; an arrangement such as this would not have been made if this were in fact the Priest's house. In the 17th century the Priest's house's principal room, on the upper storey, was given a decorative plaster ceiling.|$|E
50|$|From Wickham Street is {{a second}} {{entrance}} lobby, and vestibule with tessellated tiles. The timber stair features substantial <b>newels,</b> twisted balusters, and boarding to the underside. From the mid landing is the window opening to the former chamber, and a doorway to a small room and stair to the exterior.|$|R
50|$|The six-storey {{building}} {{was completed in}} 1911. It was designed in the Georgian Revival architectural style by Shattuck and Hussey, an architectural firm based in Chicago. Inside, {{there is a large}} cast-iron <b>neweled</b> staircase. Percy Warner, a prominent Nashville businessman, served as Chairman of the Building Committee. It was dedicated on May 9, 1911.|$|R
50|$|The {{staircase}} {{is located}} on {{the eastern side of the}} entry space and features a cedar balustrade with turned balusters and substantial <b>newels.</b> The stairwell and anterooms on both levels are lined with horizontal tongue-in-groove boarding, painted with a colour scheme of a dark brown dado, cream walls and white ceilings. Floors are timber.|$|R
