25|$|The {{presence}} of heavy metals in the clinker arises {{both from the}} natural raw materials and {{from the use of}} recycled by-products or alternative fuels. The high pH prevailing in the cement porewater (12.5 < pH < 13.5) limits the mobility of many heavy metals by decreasing their solubility and increasing their sorption onto the cement mineral phases. Nickel, zinc and lead are commonly found in cement in non-negligible concentrations. Chromium may also directly arise as <b>natural</b> <b>impurity</b> from the raw materials or as secondary contamination from the abrasion of hard chromium steel alloys used in the ball mills when the clinker is ground.

Researchers in Japan were attempting to use t-butyl peroxide {{as a catalyst for}} decarboxylation using a solvent choice of cyclohexanol. Curiously they found that when they used lower-purity (e.g. technical grade, 98%) cyclohexanol, the reaction proceeded as much as 4 times faster compared to when they used relatively pure cyclohexanol (>99.3%). They found that cyclohexanol contained cyclohexenone as a <b>natural</b> <b>impurity,</b> which was three times more abundant in the technical grade cyclohexenone compared to the more purified cyclohexanol (~0.3% versus ~0.1%). Further research showed that 1% Cyclohexenone in cyclohexanol will decarboxylate most alpha-amino acids, including non-standard ones, with a yield of 80-95% in a matter of several hours. The exceptions are certain amino acids like histidine, which was reported to take over 26 hours, and poly-amino acids, which fail to decarboxylate using 2-cyclohexenone and another route must be found instead.|$|E

40|$|To {{identify}} {{the most promising}} positive electrodes for Ca-based liquid metal batteries, the thermodynamic properties of diverse Ca-based liquid alloys were investigated. The thermodynamic properties of Ca-Sb alloys were determined by emf measurements. It was found that Sb as positive electrode would provide the highest voltage for Ca-based liquid metal batteries (1 V). The price of such a battery would be competitive for the grid-scale energy storage market. The impact of Pb, a <b>natural</b> <b>impurity</b> of Sb, was predicted successfully and confirmed via electrochemical measurements. It was shown that {{the impact on the}} open circuit voltage would be minor. Indeed, the interaction between Ca and Sb was demonstrated to be much stronger than between Ca and Pb using thermodynamic modeling, which explains why the partial thermodynamic properties of Ca would not vary much with the addition of Pb to Sb. However, the usage of the positive electrode would be reduced, which would limit the interest of a Pb-Sb positive electrode. Throughout this work, the molecular interaction volume model (MIVM) was used for the first time for alloys with thermodynamic properties showing strong negative deviation from ideality. This model showed that systems such as Ca-Sb have strong short-range order: Ca is most stable when its first nearest neighbors are Sb. This is consistent with what the more traditional thermodynamic model, the regular association model, would predict. The advantages of the MIVM are the absence of assumption regarding the composition of an associate, and the reduced number of fitting parameters (2 instead of 5). Based on the parameters derived from the thermodynamic modeling using the MIVM, a new potential of mixing for liquid alloys was defined to compare the strength of interaction in different Ca-based alloys. Comparing this trend with the strength of interaction in the solid state of these systems (assessed by the energy of formation of the intermetallics), the systems with the most stable intermetallics were found to have the strongest interaction in the liquid state. Eventually, a new criteria was formulated to select electrode materials for liquid metal batteries. Systems with the most stable intermetallics, which can be evaluated by the enthalpy of formation of these systems, will yield the highest voltage when assembled as positive and negative electrodes in a liquid metal battery. by Sophie Poizeau.

Ferrihydrite is {{a poorly}} ordered iron (oxyhydr) oxide, {{ubiquitous}} in near-surface environments, {{where it is}} an important scavenger of numerous toxic metals and metalloids (Cornell & Schwertmann 2003). Being metastable, ferrihydrite transforms with time into stable phases, usually goethite and/or hematite. The latter is also a final product of ferrihydrite thermal conversion via both, hydrothermal and dry-heating pathways. The transformation course is affected by many factors and for this reason its details are still under debate. Pure ferrihydrite practically does not exist in nature. The admixtures present in its composition affect many properties of the oxyhydroxide, including surface chemistry, sorption effectiveness, crystallinity, magnetic ordering and solubility. Silicate, probably the most important <b>natural</b> <b>impurity,</b> was shown to hamper thermal transformation of ferrihydrite. The process was studied in detail only for relatively low-Si samples (Campbell et al. 2002). In some environments, such as modern seafloor hydrothermal vents, higher Si/Fe proportion have been found (Sun et al. 2013). The objective of this work was to determine if (and if so, how) the high silicate content in ferrihydrite modifies its thermal transformation. Ferrihydrite samples of high Si/Fe molar ratios (0. 50, 0. 75, 1. 00, and 1. 50) were obtained by reaction of Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 with NaOH in the presence of Na 2 SiO 3 at pH 8. 2 (Vempati & Loeppert 1989). The products were characterized using X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Simultaneous thermal analyses, including differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetry (TG) and quadrupole mass spectrometry of evolved gases (QMS) were also performed. All of the ferrihydrites were heated from 30 °C • min− 1 to 1000 °C • min− 1, at 10 °C • min− 1 in flowing air, using preheated sample as an inert material. The samples were also heated to various temperatures, chosen {{on the basis of the}} analysis of their thermal patterns. The heating was stopped immediately when reaching the desired temperature. The sample was removed, rapidly cooled in air and characterized again by XRD, FTIR and SEM. The thermal patterns revealed that the presence of Si in ferrihydrite hampers its conversion to hematite, which is reflected by shifting of the hematite crystallization exotherm to temperature as high as ca. 920 °C, in comparison to 350 – 460 °C when Si-free ferrihydrite is annealed (Pieczara et al. 2014). XRD patterns and FTIR spectra of the samples heated to 1000 °C show the presence of hematite and cristobalite. It was observed that the higher molar Si-to-Fe ratio in initial mineral results in the higher cristobalite concentration in the product. SEM observation showed that hematite crystallites, embedded in cryptocrystalline silica, are distinctly smaller than those produced from pure ferrihydrite. They also exhibit wider range of crystal habits – isometric grains, plates, rods and even needles were encountered. Elongated crystallites (rods and needles) appear to be more common in the highest-Si products. Moreover, whilst during transformation of pure ferrihydrite into hematite no distinct intermediate phase is formed, the conversion of high-Si ferrihydrite proceeds by much more complex pathway. After low-temperature dehydration, the material still exhibits two-peak ferrihydrite-like XRD pattern, but a gradual amorphisation is observed up to ca. 600 °C. Then, at 650 °C amorphous silica emerges which is followed by the formation of nanocrystalline maghemite (γ-Fe 2 O 3) between 700 °C and 800 °C. Subsequently, maghemite is transformed to orthorhombic ε-Fe 2 O 3 phase at 800 – 850 °C. In the samples of 0. 50, 0. 75 and 1. 0 Si/Fe ratios, further increase of temperature results in ε-Fe 2 O 3 conversion to hematite and crystallization of cristobalite-like phase. However, XRD patterns of annealed the highest-Si sample (Si/Fe = 1. 5) show also the presence of β-Fe 2 O 3 between 907 °C and 930 °C. At 907 °C hematite appears and ε-Fe 2 O 3 vanishes by 930 °C, so at the latter temperature two Fe 2 O 3 polymorphs (α and β) are present. At 1000 °C hematite is the sole iron oxide in all the products. Thus siliceous ferrihydrites transform into hematite via γ–ε or γ–ε–β pathway, depending on the Si/Fe ratio. Formation of rare epsilon and beta iron oxide polymorphs from high-Si ferrihydrites can be explained by emerging of amorphous SiO 2 during annealing, which subsequently acts as antisintering agent stabilizing maghemite precursor against its direct thermal conversion to hematite. Our results show that high silicate content causes not only the retarding of ferrihydrite conversion to hematite but also affects crystallinity of the product and complicates the transformation pathway. In the authors’ opinion the formation of rare epsilon and beta Fe 2 O 3 is noteworthy for at least two reasons. Firstly, β- and, especially, ε-Fe 2 O 3 have been recently found to exhibit many interesting physical properties, which make them attractive nanomaterials for use in a wide range of applications (Machala et al. 2011). Annealing of Si-ferrihydrites might offer an alternative method of obtaining these oxides. Secondly, both these oxides have not been found in nature yet. This work suggests that their formation is possible in places where siliceous ferrihydrites or other Si-Fe amorphous sediments have been heated to high temperature, as in e. g. hydrothermal systems of mid-ocean ridges.

First, a physico-chemical description (molecular weight (M-W), polydispersity (M-W/M-N), fraction of acetylation (F-A), pattern of acetylation (P-A), hydrodynamic radius (R-h), intrinsic viscosity ([eta])) of six selected samples was done.

It was found that the presence of HCl enabled the water solubility of chitosan, while chloride-free chitosan was only soluble in acetic acid. The pattern of acetylation P-A showed no impact on this behavior. The analyzed biological effects revealed growth inhibition within 30 minutes for E. coli and a decreased bioluminescence for V. fisheri (IC 50 = 0. 035 w%).

The middle layer induced the best new bone formation among divided silk cocoon layers (Fig.  6 g). The middle layer may have the optimal composition ratio of silk fibroin and sericin for bone formation. Comparing between different thicknesses of the same silk cocoon middle layer, the thicker membrane leads to better new bone formation [21]. Therefore, the silk mat from the middle layer only seemed to be proper for GBR technique. The inner and outermost layers of the silk cocoon should be removed before use for the GBR technique. Except for the different amino acid composition among layers, other differences among layers are still unclear. The exact mechanism should be clarified by further studies.|$|R

It has long been thought that the process of laterisation involves the formation of hydrous iron oxides and their subsequent dehydration over geological time. It is of interest to the engineer to accelerate this process, but little success has been reported hitherto. The present study has shown that in the presence of activated silica and fine iron oxide, clay minerals as diverse as montmorillonite and kaolinite can be induced to yield very strong compacts, almost comparable with brick, {{in a matter of days}} at ambient temperatures. After extensive investigation of the optimal conditions for thermal stabilisation and activation of clays and soils, the optimal process finally developed involved heating a fine-grained soil to a temperature high enough to destroy its water sensitivity, adding finely divided iron oxide, and then introducing a sodium silicate and/or sodium hydroxide solution. After compaction the mixture sets into a hard material. The products responsible for this stabilisation have been shown to be strong, durable, and water resistant. They have been identified by X-ray and electron probe as a series of complex iron silicates (having various substitutions); five of the major compounds responsible for the stabilisation appear to be hitherto unreported in the literature. Although the reaction mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, it seems possible that it will provide important insights into the practicability of achieving accelerated laterisation in clay soils, and permit the development of a range of new durable and strong products based on ordinary soil rather than pure clay minerals; since the method of preparation appears to be insensitive to many <b>natural</b> <b>impurities,</b> and the quality of product may even be improved thereby...|$|R
30|$|From Table  5, it was {{observed}} that there is no change in the Tegewa rating, whereas there is an increase in the rate of absorbency by 10 folds and increase in whiteness index by 2.7 times. The reason behind the enhancement in fabric properties might be the presence of alkali and hydrogen peroxide in the scouring and bleaching process water which helps in removing the oils, fats, waxes and the <b>natural</b> coloured <b>impurities</b> during the desizing process also elevating the absorbency and whiteness index of a grey fabric. From the above observations, it has been seen that when the ratio of scouring and bleaching process water changes, the properties of fabric changes. When the amount of scouring process water is more, good absorbency is obtained, whereas if the quantity of bleaching process water is more, the fabric has good whiteness index.|$|R
40|$|The {{biopolymer}} chitosan {{has shown}} a great potential for {{a tremendous number of}} applications despite the fact that typical chitosan preparations are always mixtures of different chemical entities, <b>natural</b> <b>impurities</b> and process-induced impurities. Chitosan preparations described in the literature or offered on the market are analytically highly undefined which prevents a detailed structure-activity-relationship (SAR) analysis. The aim of this thesis is to accomplish the prerequisites necessary for a sophisticated study of the polymers chitin/chitosan. Within this thesis a SAR guided multi-dimensional analysis is proposed including a physicochemical description (molecular weight (MW), polydispersity (MW/MN), fraction of acetylation (FA), and determination of the purity content combined to biological effects on two different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Vibrio fischeri). Results are obtained by methods such as triple detection size-exclusion chromatography (refractive index, light scattering (90 ° and 7 °), viscometry), inhibition assays and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, an improved method to determine the pattern of acetylation PA from heterogeneously as well as homogeneously prepared chitosan is shown. No link between the different production processes and the formation of a specific pattern of acetylation was found. For all investigated sample a random-dominated pattern was found. The obtained PA values include also calculated inter-day and inter-analyst variations of the carbon nuclear magnetic resonance technique (13 C-NMR). The conformational analysis of chitosan, again achieved with the triple detection SEC, revealed an interesting behavior. Using different theoretical models (Benoit-Doty, Odijk-Houwart, Bohdanecky) different Kuhn segment lengths (lK) were found for the two different samples. While the first approached linear chain behavior, the second showed similarity to dextran, a branched polysaccharide. Dissolution studies on chitin and chitosan showed positive results in 18 cases (chitosan) and 6 cases (chitin), respectively, by testing 58 different ionic liquid samples in total. In case of chitin, ionic liquids may be promising candidates for future dissolution studies of this biopolymer. However, chitin behaves completely different in dissolution assays than its relative cellulose which may based on three different dissolution mechanism each for chitosan, chitin and cellulose, respectively...|$|R
2500|$|The Niagara Falls, New York, water {{treatment}} plant first used chlorine dioxide for drinking {{water treatment}} in 1944 for phenol destruction. Chlorine dioxide was introduced as a drinking water disinfectant {{on a large scale}} in 1956, when Brussels, Belgium, changed from chlorine to chlorine dioxide. Its most common use in water treatment is as a pre-oxidant prior to chlorination of drinking water to destroy <b>natural</b> water <b>impurities</b> that would otherwise produce trihalomethanes on exposure to free chlorine. Trihalomethanes are suspect carcinogenic disinfection by-products associated with chlorination of naturally occurring organics in the raw water. [...] Chlorine dioxide is also superior to chlorine when operating above pH 7, in the presence of ammonia and amines and/or for the control of biofilms in water distribution systems. Chlorine dioxide is used in many industrial water treatment applications as a biocide including cooling towers, process water, and food processing.|$|R
