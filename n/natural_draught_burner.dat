50|$|Most modern boilers {{depend on}} {{mechanical}} <b>draught</b> rather than <b>natural</b> <b>draught.</b> This is because <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> {{is subject to}} outside air conditions and temperature of flue gases leaving the furnace, {{as well as the}} chimney height.

5000|$|Machinery {{consisted}} of 4 three-cylinder triple expansion engines fed by six double-ended cylindrical boilers and driving two shafts. The engines generated [...] under <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> and [...] with forced draught, giving {{a speed of}} 22 kn with forced draught and 20 kn with <b>natural</b> <b>draught.</b> The forward two engines could be disconnected for longer endurance at low speeds. 1800 LT of coal could be carried, double the fuel of the Orlandos, giving a range of [...] at 10 kn, which was {{much less than the}} [...] expected.|$|R
50|$|Prof Frederik van Iterson (12 March 1877 - 11 December 1957) was a Dutch {{mechanical}} engineering professor (Hoogleraar), who largely developed the typical design of power station <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> cooling tower, being built from 1918.|$|R
500|$|The {{simplest}} forge, {{known as}} the Corsican, was used prior to the advent of Christianity. Examples of improved bloomeries are the [...] (sometimes called wolf-furnace) or the Catalan forge, which remained {{until the beginning of}} the 19th century. The Catalan forge was invented in Catalonia, Spain, during the 8th century. Instead of using <b>natural</b> <b>draught,</b> air was pumped in by a trompe, resulting in better quality iron and an increased capacity. This pumping of airstream in with bellows is known as cold blast, and it increases the fuel efficiency of the bloomery and improves yield. The Catalan forges can also be built bigger than <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> bloomeries.|$|R
50|$|Emissions {{reductions}} {{and increases in}} thermal efficiency have {{reached the point where}} <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> is no longer sufficient to draw flue gas up the stack, necessitating the use of induced draught fans and/or reheating of the flue gas using natural gas burners.|$|R

50|$|Propulsion was {{provided}} by two sets of Laird Brothers vertical triple-expansion steam engines, making her the first vessel in the Royal Navy to have such efficient engines. Steam was supplied from locomotive boilers and twin screws propelled her at up to 16+3/4 kn on <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> or 19+1/4 kn with forced draught.|$|R
50|$|Buenos Aires was {{launched}} on 10 May 1895, and underwent steaming trials on 2 November 1895, reaching an average speed of 23.202 kn {{over a period}} of six hours with <b>natural</b> <b>draught,</b> with gunnery trials following on 29 November that year. The ship was completed in February 1896, and reaching Argentina on 29 April 1896.|$|R
50|$|After having fed the turbine, {{the steam}} is {{condensed}} by the tertiary cooling loop, which water is at 22 °C.

40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{progressive}} damage process of <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> cooling towers is analysed numerically. A non-linear composite material {{model for the}} reinforced concrete is formulated. Regarding the durability a special {{attention is paid to}} the cracking process and the determination of the crack width. Within the framework of the static analysis two existing large <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> cooling towers are analysed considering the geometrical as well as the material non-linearity in detail. The modifications of the dynamic characteristics are identified by means of the natural frequency analysis. The structural damage is quantified by global damage indicators related to the natural frequencies of the cooling tower. The influence of the damage process on the increase of the wind excitation is assessed in consideration of the shifted natural frequencies in the VON-KARMAN wind spectrum. The analyses demonstrate that the shift of the dynamic system due to damage process leads to a progressive damage process in the structure...|$|R
5000|$|The Apollo-class cruisers were {{enlarged}} {{versions of}} the preceding [...] Rainbow displaced 3600 LT, which made the ship heavier than some of her sister ships. This was due to being among the ten vessels in the class sheathed in wood and copper for tropical service. This added 200 LT to their displacement. The Apollo-class cruisers were 300 ft long between perpendiculars and 314 ft overall. Sheathed vessels had a beam of 43 ft and a draught of 18 ft. The cruisers were propelled by a two shaft, two-cylinder triple expansion engine powered by steam from three double-ended and two single-ended boilers creating [...] at <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> and [...] at forced draught. This gave the cruisers a maximum speed of 18.5 kn at <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> and 19.75 kn at forced draught. The Apollo class carried 535 LT of coal for fuel. With full bunkers of coal, the cruisers had a range of [...] at 10 kn.|$|R

The towers were 88 metres in height and used the <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> {{hyperboloid}} design. The towers stood for 50 years, creating a landmark visible from the village of Seascale. Conflict arose over renovating Calder Hall and preserving the towers, but costs effectively defeated all attempts to do so.|$|R
5000|$|HMS Gibraltar, was an [...] cruiser {{launched}} in 1892 for {{service in the}} Royal Navy. She was built and engineered by Messrs Napier of Glasgow. Of 7,700 loaded displacement, she was coal-fired with four double-ended cylindrical boilers driving two shafts.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Natural</b> <b>draught</b> {{cooling towers}} are {{very common in}} modern days thermal and nuclear power stations. These towers with very small shell {{thickness}} are exceptional structures by their sheer size and sensitivity to horizontal loads. These are the hyperbolic shells of revolution in form and are supported on closely spaced inclined columns. Wind loading on NDCT governs critical cases and requires research. This paper emphasize on effect of wind on <b>Natural</b> <b>draught</b> hyperbolic cooling tower. The slenderness of the columns and the large dimensions of the shell make these structures vulnerable to earthquake and wind disturbances. In this work efficient Analysis & design of cooling tower is presented with V- shape configuration of Raker column. Finite element modeling of cooling tower shell is done which divide shell into number of plates to apply wind loading on each plate. Gust method and Peak wind Methods are adopted to apply wind load. For this purpose models are workout on Staad Pro V 8 i to give comparative results of analysis, design and constructability. Effective wind analysis {{can be done with}} the help of this methodology...|$|R
5000|$|Balanced flue—Use the <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> {{created by}} the hot exhaust, so the flue is as short as possible, usually {{sufficiently}} long to pass through an external wall against or near which the appliance is installed. The balanced flue terminal has both flue outlet and air inlet in close proximity, so any draughts or wind gusts pressure both equally and cancel out in the appliance. Thus the burner flame and even pilot lights are not affected.|$|R
5000|$|HMS Pelorus {{displaced}} 2,135 {{tons and}} had {{a top speed of}} 20 kn. She had reciprocating triple expansion engines and Normand water-tube boilers which could give [...] for limited periods of time with forced draught, and [...] under <b>natural</b> <b>draught.</b> It carried a crew complement of 224 men and it was armed with eight QF 4 inch (102 mm) (25 pounder) guns, eight QF 3 pounder (47-mm) guns, three machine guns, and two 18-inch (450-mm) torpedo tubes.|$|R
50|$|Fuel torches are {{available}} in a vast range of size and output power. The term blowtorch applies to the smaller and lower temperature range of these. Blowtorches are typically a single hand-held unit, with their draught supplied by a <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> of air. The larger torches may have a heavy fuel reservoir placed on the ground, connected by a hose. This is common for butane- or propane-fuelled gas torches, but also applies to the older, large liquid paraffin (kerosene) torches such as the Wells light.|$|R
5000|$|A {{bloomery}} {{consists of}} a [...] or chimney with heat-resistant walls made of earth, clay, or stone. Near the bottom, one or more pipes (made of clay or metal) enter through the side walls. These pipes, called tuyeres, allow air to enter the furnace, either by <b>natural</b> <b>draught,</b> or forced with bellows or a trompe. An opening {{at the bottom of}} the bloomery may be used to remove the bloom, or the bloomery can be tipped over and the bloom removed from the top.|$|R
5000|$|Boilers {{to supply}} the steam engine are housed in a {{single-storey}} boilerhouse alongside the main brewhouse, usually with a prominent chimney to provide <b>natural</b> <b>draught.</b> Process steam from the same boilers heats the large quantity of water needed in brewing, including hot liquor (water used in mashing that will become beer) and may {{also be used to}} heat brewing coppers. Some breweries, such as Hook Norton, still use direct heat beneath these brew kettles, but this raises problems of temperature control and local overheating.|$|R
5000|$|The Sharpshooter {{class was}} {{designed}} by Sir William White in 1888. They had a length overall of 242 ft, a beam of 27 ft and a displacement of 735 tons. [...] They were engined with two sets of triple-expansion steam engines, two locomotive-type boilers, and twin screws. This layout produced [...] with <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> and [...] with forced draught, giving them {{a top speed of}} 19 kn. [...] They carried 100 tons of coal, giving them a range of about 2500 nmi km at 10 kn and were manned by 91 sailors and officers.|$|R
50|$|The boilers are {{balanced}} <b>draught</b> with tilting <b>burners</b> {{mounted in}} the corners of the furnace. Each boiler produces 376 tonnes/hour of steam at 120 bar and 538 °C, with one stage of reheat to 538 °C.|$|R
50|$|The {{machinery}} {{was initially}} supplied by Penn for the Portsmouth ship and Humphry's, Tennant & Company of Depford for the Pembroke ship. The ships were equipped with eight rectangular boilers powering two 2-cylinder trunk direct acting steam engines turning two shafts producing 6,650 indicated horsepower (IHP) under a <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> (ND) for a designed speed of 13.75 knots. The ships carried 1,800 tons of coal giving a cruising range of 5,980 nautical miles at a nominal speed of 10 knots. They could remain at sea for approximately 12 days with fuel available to steam {{at full speed}} for a short duration.|$|R
50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of using burning appliances connected to <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> chimneys without pilot lights {{is the lack}} of the starting draught in the chimney. Without a pilot light the chimney can cool down completely to the outside temperature, therefore there is no chimney draught this case at all, or there can be even a negative chimney draught if the outside temperature is higher than the inner temperature in the house. This case there is a backflow in the chimney. This is the reason of feeling the smell of soot at summertime at the chimneys openings. If there is a backflow in the chimney, {{it is possible that the}} cool air and the hot flue gases both entering into the appliance’s room via the openings of the gas appliance draught diverter, which can cause high level of carbon-monoxide in the air of the room, resulting possible deaths or permanent disability. In such a situation there is no strong physical effect which would drive the flue gases into the chimney, so the power, which cause the backflow in the chimney can be determinative. According to statistics the “starting draught” in chimneys assured by the permanent pilots has an important role to prevent an increase in the number of carbon monoxide poisonings. So in case of open fired appliances and <b>natural</b> <b>draught</b> chimneys the goals of the energy savings and the safety aspects are opposite.|$|R
50|$|She {{was then}} {{the first of the}} fleet to be {{modified}} to burn bunker oil and coal tar; between 8 March and 3 August 1939 Baragoola was altered to an oil burner using tar under <b>natural</b> <b>draught,</b> like the Curl Curl, Dee Why and South Steyne. Propellers of improved design were also fitted at this time. Other modifications included in 1948 the removal of her chain operated steering gear that were replaced with Brown Brothers (later known as Vickers) hydraulic equipment. In 1958, it was withdrawn for a rebuild by which included the replacement of its steam engines with English Electric 7SKM diesel-electric engines. It returned to service in 1961.|$|R
