Up {{to that point}} we'd still been singing about bowling down California highways. I mean, it meant <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Although the Damned and the Pistols were great, they were only exciting musically; lyrically, I couldn't really make out a lot if it... o realise that [...] were actually singing about their own lives in West London was like a bolt out of the blue.|$|E
500|$|During {{the spring}} of 1964, Ray Davies played {{an early version of}} [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] on piano to rock {{photographer}} Allan Ballard during a photo shoot. Ballard later remembered, [...] "It was quite a small, pokey, Victorian Terrace, a bit scruffy, and in the hallway they had an upright piano. Ray sat down and plonked out, 'Der-der, der, Der-der!' He said, 'What do you reckon to this?' It meant <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at the time, but it ended up as 'You Really Got Me'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{role was}} the most {{difficult}} to cast, and eventually the filmmakers decided to approach Cleese, noting [...] "Who would you rather make the argument [...] for mankind than John Cleese?" [...] Stoff, a producer, had met Cleese a few times beforehand and had noted his intellect. The actor was surprised the filmmakers were interested in him, and decided playing a dramatic role would be easier than to play a comedic one at his age. He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in synchronity with normal human speech patterns. Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often philosophizes about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters. Cleese spoke about portraying abilities outside his own experience in the scene in which Klaatu corrects a formula Barnhardt has written on a blackboard: [...] "The trouble is, I {{had to be able to}} write the equation, because Barnhardt has been working on it for 60 years. I learned to carefully copy things down that mean <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at all. In A Fish Called Wanda, I spoke a lot of Russian without having any idea what it means." ...|$|E

[...] "Your {{expression}} of opinion is interesting <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> In the meantime, {{to revert to}} business, am I right in concluding that you have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{that you do not}} wish even to discuss a certain matter?" ...|$|R
500|$|Man Ray photographed {{some of the}} {{mathematical}} models in the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, including Objet mathematique (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented Enneper surfaces with constant negative curvature, derived from the pseudo-sphere. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was [...] "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [...] formula [...] "meant <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." [...] He used his photographs of {{the mathematical}} models as figures in his series he did on Shakespeare's plays, such as his 1934 painting Antony and Cleopatra. The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ForbesLife, argues that Man Ray photographed [...] "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of Kiki de Montparnasse", and [...] "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire". Twentieth century sculptors such as Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo took inspiration from mathematical models. Moore wrote of his 1938 Stringed Mother and Child: [...] "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the Science Museum... I {{was fascinated by the}} mathematical models I saw there... It wasn't the scientific study of these models but the ability to look through the strings as with a bird cage and to see one form within another which excited me." ...|$|E

[...] Even at that early stage of his career he was highly particular about his work; in an interview at that time he said [...] " [...] plates are <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> unless I get what I want. I have used thirty of them at a sitting if I did not secure the effect to suit me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1948, as a captain, Griffin {{received}} sudden {{orders to}} report to the Strategic Plans Division (OP-30) in the Department of the Navy as officer in charge of special projects. [...] "That meant practically <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I heard this. It wasn't too long after I got back there that I got head over heels into the business of the so-called revolt of the admirals -- the B-36 affair. I found that the special projects {{had to do with the}} preparation of statements for the chief of naval operations on very critical points." ...|$|E

2500|$|..... this goodly {{frame the}} earth {{seems to me}} a sterile promontory, this most {{excellent}} canopy the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why it appeareth <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man—how noble in reason; how infinite in faculties, in form and moving; how express and admirable in action; how like an angel in apprehension; how like a god; the beauty of the world; the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, {{other members}} of both groups appear to have {{remained}} on good terms since the initial controversy. Regarding the perceived conflict, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stated [...] "There was never any fight between us, that {{was a bunch of}} bullshit created by the media. I mean I think they're a good band. Maybe there was some things said between Anthony and the singer , but it all means <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Those guys in the band are nice people and there's no fight." [...] At a 2014 show in Brooklyn, the band also notably covered a portion of the Chuck Mosley-era song [...] "We Care a Lot".|$|E
2500|$|... "Panic" [...] {{is a song}} by the English {{rock band}} the Smiths, {{released}} in 1986 and written by singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr. The first recording to feature new member Craig Gannon, [...] "Panic" [...] bemoans the state of contemporary pop music which [...] "says <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about my life", and exhorts listeners to [...] "burn down the disco" [...] and [...] "hang the DJ" [...] in retaliation. The song was released by Rough Trade as a single and reached No. 7 on the Irish Singles Chart and No. 11 in the UK Chart. Morrissey considered the song's appearance on daytime British radio a [...] "tiny revolution" [...] in its own way, as it aired amongst the very music it criticised.|$|E

2500|$|The song {{begins with}} Morrissey {{mentioning}} chaos unravelling throughout Britain and Ireland (specifically naming the locales as London, Birmingham, Grasmere, Carlisle, Leeds, Dublin, Dundee, and Humberside). In {{the second part}} of the song, he reveals that the source of this chaos is pop music, which [...] "says <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about my life". In reaction, he implores listeners to [...] "burn down the disco" [...] and [...] "hang the DJ", the latter lyrics repeated with the addition of a chorus of schoolchildren. Journalist Nick Kent described [...] "Panic" [...] as a mandate for [...] "rock terrorism". John Luerssen calls it a [...] "commentary on the tepid state of pop music in 1986" [...] and a [...] "chiming guitar song," [...] based around a rotation between the G and E minor chords. Simon Goddard has said it mimics [...] "Metal Guru" [...] by the glam rock band T.Rex. Luerssen calls the song Marr's homage to the T.Rex song.|$|E
2500|$|The film drew {{praise from}} critics in Spain, {{including}} La Vanguardia, who compared Julieta to the female-centric films of George Cukor and Kenji Mizoguchi while noting hints of Alfred Hitchcock in Almodóvar's screenplay. Alfonso Rivera of Cineuropa additionally observed influences of Ingmar Bergman, Krzysztof Kieślowski and Douglas Sirk in Almodóvar's style. Vicente Molina Fox from El País believed Almodóvar had achieved the best script {{of his career}} with Julieta, while Luis Martínez of El Mundo, despite finding issues with the narrative, thought Julieta was Almodóvar's [...] "most difficult and most pure film". Spanish edition of Vanity Fair also called it [...] "the most Almodóvar film by Almodóvar". Quim Casas from El Periódico de Catalunya said that Almodóvar had reinvented melodrama: [...] "Prodigious in dramatic tone, Julieta is very Almodóvarian {{but at the same}} time different to other works by the auteur". ABC gave the film a mixed review; praising Suárez in the lead role but criticising narrative choices. , the [...] "sworn critical enemy" [...] of Almodóvar, penned an extremely negative review in El País, feeling distanced and unable to identify with the characters because of the film's style and cinematography. Boyero stated that [...] "the film conveys <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> either emotionally or artistically". El Confidencial also responded negatively, calling the film [...] "a barren drama", [...] "unsubtle" [...] and [...] "self-indulgent".|$|E
2500|$|George Loddiges' {{tropical}} hothouse range {{made use}} of recently invented curvilinear iron glazing bars and central heating systems, which together with his own inventions, enabled many new species of tropical plant to be introduced into cultivation, or flower {{for the first time}} in Europe. Visiting the hothouses on 30 March 1822, the Quaker pharmacist William Allen, his Cousin Emily Birkbeck and Anna Hanbury noted: We all went to Loddiges Nursery to see the camellias which are now in full bloom and very beautiful ! There is quite a forest of them: his hot-houses are, perhaps, the most capricious in the world: one off them is forty feet high: in this there is a banana tree which nearly reaches the top. A few years later, in 1829, Jacob Rinz (a visitor from a Frankfurt nursery) commented: never shall I forget the sensation produced by this establishment. I cannot describe the raptures I experienced on seeing that immense palm house. All that I had seen before of the kind appeared <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> compared with this. I fancied myself in the and especially at that moment when Mr Loddiges had the kindness to produce, in my presence, a shower of artificial rain. Such conditions were ideal for tropical orchids, several of which were named in honour of George Loddiges, including Loddiges' dendrobium.|$|E
