5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E

Balcon, who produced the film, chose Robert Hamer as director and warned him that [...] "You are trying to sell that most unsaleable commodity to the British – irony. Good luck to you." [...] Hamer disliked Pertwee, who withdrew from the project, leaving the scriptwriting to Hamer and John Dighton. Hamer saw the potential of the story and later wrote ...|$|E
500|$|Smith {{starred in}} {{and served as}} {{executive}} producer for the independent romantic comedy Waiting for Ophelia, which was released in 2009. She funded the film, which was written by Adam Carl and based on a stage play he wrote in 2003. She said: [...] "I loved it. I never get to play parts like that. I always play the friend of a friend, never the lead. And the script surprised me." [...] Carl stated it was very unlikely she would recoup her money, but Smith decided she [...] "believe in this project, and my expectations have already been fulfilled by making the movie", and added: [...] "You can support art even if it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> zillion dollars." [...] It premiered on April 4, 2009 at the Phoenix Film Festival.|$|E

Hopefully, he can win them. Finishing third in a Breeders' Cup, either one, isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do me a bit of good with the horse; it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him a champion, it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> me rich enough to retire." ...|$|R
500|$|During {{the last}} story arc from the manga, the story takes a darker tone than those [...] from other shōnen series {{published}} by Shueisha. As {{the series was}} aimed at teenagers, Watsuki made Yahiko the main character during the time when Kenshin thought that Kamiya Kaoru was dead; his role was {{to serve as the}} identifying character for readers. However, the author found this hard to do, as the more time Kenshin was unwilling to continue to live, the worse Yahiko felt, leaving Watsuki a more negative feeling concerning the story. By the end of the series as Yahiko becomes a teenager, Watsuki had redesigned his appearance. He wanted [...] Yahiko to impress manga readers [...] so that he [...] could [...] be a protagonist for a possible [...] series sequel. He said this goal influenced his design of Yahiko, with Kenshin's physical appearance as well as Sanosuke's personality. He added Sanosuke's kanji of [...] {{to the back of his}} clothes, and was pleased that various readers recognized it. Although he suggested he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sequel, he said the main characters would be Yahiko, Sanjō Tsubame and Tsukayama Yutarō. Watsuki thought about writing a story in which Yahiko and Tsubame would have a son, Myōjin Shinya, who would become a skilled swordsman.|$|E

2500|$|The Patriots had no timeouts {{left for}} their ensuing drive, which led Fox color {{commentator}} John Madden to initially {{suggest that the}} Patriots should run out the clock and attempt to win in overtime. Instead, New England attempted to get the winning score in regulation on the final drive. Bill Belichick conferred with offensive coordinator Charlie Weis and they agreed to go for it. Belichick would say later, [...] "With a quarterback like Brady, going for the win is not that dangerous, because he's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> mistake." [...] Brady opened the drive with three dump-off completions to running back J. R. Redmond, who got out of bounds on the last one and moved the ball to their 41-yard line with 33 seconds left. At this point, Madden admitted on the air that he now liked what the Patriots were doing. After an incomplete pass, Brady completed a 23-yard pass underneath the Rams' zone defense to wide receiver Troy Brown--who also got out of bounds--and followed {{it up with a}} 6-yard completion to tight end Jermaine Wiggins to advance to the Rams' 30-yard line. Brady then spiked the ball with seven seconds left, which set up Vinatieri's 48-yard field goal attempt. Vinatieri's game-winning kick was successful, marking the first time in Super Bowl history that a game was won by a score on the final play.|$|E

[...] "Believe me, mamma, that I am not unhappy," [...] she said.|$|E
60|$|Good Master Richard's {{conscience}} {{had little}} occasion to wince, yet {{he could not}} but feel somewhat guilty when this opportune commission was given to him, since the Earl gave it unaware of his secret understanding with the captive.
