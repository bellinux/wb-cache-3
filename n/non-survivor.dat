40|$|Background: Hyperglycaemia is {{associated}} with adverse outcomes {{in the intensive care}} unit, and initial studies suggested outcome benefits of glycaemic control (GC). However, subsequent studies often failed to replicate these results, and they were often unable to achieve consistent, safe control, raising questions about the benefit or harm of GC as well as the nature of the association of glycaemia with mortality and clinical outcomes. In this study, we evaluated if <b>non-survivors</b> are harder to control than survivors and determined if glycaemic outcome is a function of patient condition and eventual outcome or of the glycaemic control provided. Methods: Clinically validated, model-based, hour-to-hour insulin sensitivity (SI) and its hour-to-hour variability (%ΔSI) were identified over the first 72 h of therapy in 145 patients (119 survivors, 26 <b>non-survivors).</b> In hypothesis testing, we compared distributions of SI and %ΔSI in 6 -hourly blocks for survivors and <b>non-survivors.</b> In equivalence testing, we assessed if differences in these distributions, based on blood glucose measurement error, were clinically significant. Results: SI level was never equivalent between survivors and <b>non-survivors</b> (95 % CI of percentage difference in medians outside ± 12 %). <b>Non-survivors</b> had higher SI, ranging from 9 % to 47 % higher overall in 6 -h blocks, and this difference became statistically significant as glycaemic control progressed. %ΔSI was equivalent between survivors and <b>non-survivors</b> for all 6 -hourly blocks (95 % CI of difference in medians within ± 12 %) and decreased in general over time as glycaemic control progressed. Conclusions: Whereas <b>non-survivors</b> had higher SI levels, variability was equivalent to that of survivors over the first 72 h. These results indicate survivors and <b>non-survivors</b> are equally controllable, given an effective glycaemic control protocol, suggesting that glycaemia level and variability, and thus the association between glycaemia and outcome, are essentially determined by the control provided rather than by underlying patient or metabolic condition.

40|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} study was to {{investigate}} variability of oxidative stress during sepsis evolution. ICU patients with the diagnosis of septic shock were included. Thiobarbituric-acid reactive substances, total antioxidant capacity, protein carbonyls in plasma, reduced, oxidized glutathione and catalase activity in erythrocyte lysate were assessed in the 1 st, 3 rd, 5 th and 8 th day after sepsis appearance. A total of 17 patients were divided in two groups: survivors (n = 7) and <b>non-survivors</b> (n = 10). APACHE II was 11. 5 +/- 5. 4 and 19. 9 +/- 4. 97 in survivors and <b>non-survivors</b> respectively (p = 0. 005), while mean age and SOFA score at sepsis diagnosis, were similar between the two groups. GSH levels, catalase activity and protein carbonyls presented significant different course in time between survivors and <b>non-survivors</b> (p < 0. 05). Catalase activity was significantly higher in survivors (238. 8 +/- 51. 5) than <b>non-survivors</b> (166. 4 +/- 40. 2; p = 0. 005), while protein carbonyls levels were significantly lower in survivors (0. 32 +/- 0. 09) than <b>non-survivors</b> (0. 48 +/- 0. 16; p = 0. 036) on the 1 st day.

40|$|Sepsis causes high {{mortality}} and morbidity. Static lactate concentration and early lactate clearance are cited to be a predictor for sepsis survival. This {{study examined the}} clinical utility of static lactate concentration and early lactate clearance within the first six hours of admission in Emergency Department (ED) to predict 28 -day mortality rate in sepsis patients. Patients who presented with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock and admitted to ED of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre were recruited. Blood lactate concentrations were measured upon admission (H 0), at 1 st hour (H 1) and 6 th hour (H 6), respectively. Either standard treatment of sepsis or early goal directed therapy was initiated according to sepsis severity. A follow-up report was conducted at 28 days via telephone call, e-mail or case notes. Patients were later classified into survivor and <b>non-survivor</b> as final outcome. Static lactate concentration appeared to be significantly higher for <b>non-survivor</b> {{as compared to the}} survival group at H 0, H 1 and H 6 (p< 0. 05). The lactate clearance trend reflects no relationship between early lactate clearance and 28 -day mortality. Static lactate concentration showed a superior predictor for sepsis over early lactate clearance. Although early lactate clearance was unable to prove its ability to predict 28 -day mortality, our findings suggest it can be a useful tool to gauge the resuscitation outcome...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} {{study was to determine}} whether objective assessment of cardiac shifting on two-dimensional ultrasonography can predict postnatal outcome in fetuses with isolated left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Still images {{at the level of the}} four-chamber view were obtained in 23 fetuses with left-sided CDH. A group of 12 fetuses (3 <b>non-survivors</b> and 9 survivors) were examined at two periods, between 20 and 30 weeks and between 31 and 40 weeks. A further 11 fetuses (2 <b>non-survivors</b> and 9 survivors) were examined between 31 and 40 weeks. Fetal heart axis and position were determined manually and associated with postnatal outcome. RESULTS: The cardiac axis remained constant in the 9 survivors (15. 5 +/- 3. 2 versus 17. 2 +/- 3. 3, p = 0. 71) and 3 <b>non-survivors</b> (19. 0 +/- 11. 5 versus 18. 5 +/- 11. 8, p = 0. 97). There was no statistical difference between the 9 survivors and 3 <b>non-survivors</b> at the two periods. Cardiac displacement remained constant in the 9 survivors (0. 2 +/- 0. 02 versus 0. 2 +/- 0. 02, p = 0. 32) but increased significantly in the 3 <b>non-survivors</b> (0. 2 +/- 0. 04 versus 0. 4 +/- 0. 02, p = 0. 015).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Platelet indices, {{including}} {{mean platelet volume}} (MPV), {{are readily}} available blood tests, although their prognostic value in patients with septic shock has not been fully explored. Current evidence has found contradictory results. This study aims to explore the behavior of platelet indices in septic shock and their clinical prognostic value. METHODS: Charts of septic shock patients from January to December 2012 in a tertiary medical center in Northern China were reviewed retrospectively. Platelet indices were recorded during the first five consecutive days after admission, {{as well as the}} penultimate and the last day of hospital stay. The data were compared between surviving and non-surviving patients. RESULTS: A total of 124 septic shock patients were enrolled. Thirty-six of the patients survived and 88 of them expired. MPV in the <b>non-survivor</b> group was higher than that of the survivor group, especially on the last day. PDW and PLCR showed increased trends, while PCT and PLT decreased in the <b>non-survivor</b> group. Among the PLT indices, MPV had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0. 81) with a precision rate of 75. 6 % at a cut-off of 10. 5. Compared with other more usual septic shock prognostic markers, MPV is second only to lactate for the highest area under the curve.
