5|$|Cox {{sold the}} head in 1799 for £230 (about £7,400 in today's money) to three {{brothers}} named Hughes. Interested in starting their own display in Bond Street, the brothers acquired the head as part of other Cromwell-related items. Thousands of posters were produced for the event, but the exhibit was marred by doubtful provenance. The Hughes brothers and their publicist, John Cranch, wrote Cox {{to ask about the}} gaps in the journey, but Cox was evasive, leading to concerns that he had sold them a fake. Indeed, Cranch could <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a documentary history of how the head came into their hands, so improvised a story that Cromwell's head was “the only instance of a head cut off and spiked that had before been embalmed; which is precisely the case with respect to {{the head in}} question”. Although Henry Ireton had also been embalmed before being beheaded, the story stuck, but it was in vain. The exhibition was a failure. The entrance fee was high (two shillings and sixpence, about the equivalent of £5) and rumours that the head was a fake were prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Greg Glienna did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> {{with the}} surname Focker; Greg's {{character}} in the original film {{did not have a}} last name. The name was written into the script after Jim Carrey {{came up with the idea}} for the Focker surname during a creative session held before he abandoned the project. Once Meet the Parents was submitted for rating evaluation, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) questioned the surname Focker as possibly an expletive and, due to the repetitiveness of the surname throughout the film, the film was in danger of being rated R according to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The filmmakers were asked if they had made up the name or if they can prove that such a name exists. The studio submitted to the MPAA a list of real people with the surname Focker which ensured that the film retained a PG-13 rating.|$|E
5|$|The American League's closers then {{entered the}} game, with Jonathan Papelbon {{pitching}} a scoreless {{bottom of the}} eighth. In the ninth, J.J. Putz tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak pop-up and striking out Brian McCann. Pinch-hitter Dmitri Young rolled a ground ball deep in the hole to Brian Roberts, but he could <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with it. Alfonso Soriano followed with a two-run home run to right field to cut the NL's deficit to one. After Putz walked J. J. Hardy, AL manager Jim Leyland replaced him with Francisco Rodríguez. However, Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked Derrek Lee on a check-swing 3–2 pitch and then Orlando Hudson to load the bases. In a move that drew criticism, La Russa elected not to pinch-hit his last player on the bench, Albert Pujols, and instead let Aaron Rowand hit. Rowand lofted a fly ball to right field that was caught by Alex Ríos to close the game, earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory.|$|E

25|$|In a concurring opinion, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. {{joined the}} {{majority}} opinion in upholding the law against a substantive due process attack. However, he voiced doubts about the compatibility of Georgia’s law with the Eighth Amendment, noting that even consensual sodomy could be punished with up to twenty years in prison, the same sentence as aggravated battery or first-degree arson. However, since Hardwick had not been tried or sentenced, {{the question of the}} statute's constitutionality under the Eighth Amendment did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> in the case.|$|E
25|$|Moore seldom {{appeared}} throughout late 2003 {{and early}} 2004. On the May 6, 2004 episode of SmackDown!, WWE Cruiserweight Champion Chavo Guerrero issued an open challenge {{for anyone to}} face him for his title, and Moore defeated him to become the champion. She lost the championship back to Guerrero at Judgment Day in a match where his arm was tied behind his back. The company released Moore in June 2004 when the creative team could <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with any storylines for her character.|$|E

25|$|Goldman {{returned}} to novels, writing The Thing of It Is... (1967). He went {{to teach at}} Princeton, and wanted to write something but could <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with {{an idea for a}} novel. So he decided to write his first original screenplay, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, which he had been researching for eight years. He sold it for $400,000, then the highest price ever paid for an original screenplay. The resulting movie was a massive critical and commercial success and earned Goldman an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Lohmann {{began to}} play for Surrey {{at the end of}} May, and, though he took 93 wickets and helped Richardson to put Australia out for 53 on a good wicket at Lord's, it was thought he had <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to expectations. Indeed, on several {{occasions}} when pitches were suited to him (against Middlesex at The Oval, Somerset at Taunton and Lancashire at Manchester), his bowling should have met with much greater success. Still, he had a fully satisfactory benefit in the game against Yorkshire in August.|$|E
25|$|Simmons {{is known}} for a style of writing {{characterized}} by mixing sports knowledge and analysis, pop culture references, his non-sports-related personal life, and for being written {{from the viewpoint of}} a passionate sports fan. Simmons also has created numerous internet memes, most notably the Ewing Theory (though he claims he did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with the idea) and the Manning Face. At ESPN, he wrote for ESPN.com and hosted his own podcast on ESPN.com titled The B.S. Report. In 2015, ESPN announced that it would not renew Simmons's contract, which expired in September 2015.|$|E

25|$|In July 2011 it was {{revealed}} that Sara Payne had been among those targeted in the News International phone hacking scandal. Payne refused to believe it, since they had been so helpful in championing Sarah's Law. She even wrote an editorial in the newspaper's final edition. Investigators initially thought she was not hacked because her name did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> in records. However, personal details relating to her were found that were attributed to another suspected victim. Sara's phone that was hacked was given to her by the News of the World's editor {{at the time of the}} murder, Rebekah Brooks.|$|E
25|$|Labre {{set off for}} La Trappe Abbey {{to apply}} to the Order, but did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to their requirements. He was under age, he was too delicate; he had no special recommendations. He later {{attempted}} to join the Carthusians and Cistercians, but each order rejected him as unsuitable for communal life. He was, for about six weeks, a postulant with the Carthusians at Neuville. In November 1769 he obtained admission to the Cistercian Abbey of Sept-Fonts. After a short stay at Sept-Fonts his health gave way, and it was decided that his vocation lay elsewhere.|$|E

Blue Monarch Shipping attempted to purchase her in 2008, but could <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with the $8 million required.

25|$|Writing for the majority, Justice Blackmun {{noted that}} the courts had <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with an {{analytically}} sound distinction between traditional and non-traditional governmental operations. He {{noted that the}} Court had adopted a similar distinction decades earlier in challenges to the federal government's taxation of the operations of state governments, only to reject it as well. The Court denounced any efforts to draw this distinction, whether based on the historical record or on historical grounds, as arbitrary and likely to be suffused with the prejudices of an unelected branch of government as to which governmental functions are proper and traditional and which ones are not.|$|E
25|$|Constantia's {{poems are}} few and far between, yet the ones still in {{circulation}} are seen as proof of her intelligence. Many poems, epigrams, and occasional pieces flowed from her facile pen—written in Latin, Greek, or English; but as they did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to her standard of excellence, she burnt them all before her death. None of her poems have been preserved, save a few which she addressed to various friends, notably to Mrs. Barber, and which are too personal to be quoted as they could not possess any interest for the general reader; and, on the other hand, it would be unfair to give them as specimens of Mrs. Grierson's poetical abilities.|$|E
25|$|The batting {{order in}} {{baseball}} must be declared {{before the game}} begins, and can only be changed if a substitution occurs. Batting out of turn is a rule violation resulting in a penalty. When a manager makes a substitution, the new player must occupy the same place in the batting order as the old one. To allow more complicated changes in batting order, managers may use the double switch, substituting for two players simultaneously. This is typically used to replace the pitcher but put the new pitcher in {{a spot in the}} batting order that will <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to bat soon, previously occupied by another fielder (pitchers are almost uniformly poor hitters much like most specialist bowlers are poor batsmen). However, the rule remains that no individual player can ever change his position in the batting order within the same game.|$|E

Blockbuster has admitted that it {{may not be able to}} meet financial obligations required under its Chapter 11 filing, a circumstance which could mandate conversion of the bankruptcy filing to Chapter 7 (liquidation).

25|$|The {{board of}} theologians voiced their assent {{to the cause}} on 24 March 2006 as did the C.C.S. on 6 March 2007. Pope Benedict XVI {{confirmed}} that Burjan had lived a life of heroic virtue and named her as Venerable on 6 July 2007. The process for a miracle needed for beatification spanned from 30 January 2001 to 12 March 2001 in the place it occurred in and it received C.C.S. validation on 22 February 2002. The medical board met on 15 March 2007 but did <b>not</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with a conclusive verdict so met once again on 10 December 2009 and approved it; theologians followed on 25 January 2008 as did the C.C.S. on 7 June 2011.

It was alleged that no post-mortem was done on Shastri, but the Indian government in 2009, claimed it did have a report of a medical investigation conducted by Shastri's doctor and some Russian doctors. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) revealed that there was no record of any destruction or loss of documents in the PMO having a bearing on Shastri's death. The Russian butler attending on Shastri {{at the time of his}} death was arrested for suspected poisoning but released later as per the news source. It was maintained that Shastri had died of cardiac arrest but his family insisted he was poisoned.|$|E
