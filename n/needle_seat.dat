40|$|Pelton turbine is {{an engine}} that {{facilitates}} continuous {{power as a}} wheel or a rotor continually turns due to the pressure of fast moving water through the bucket, where a bucket receives water from the surging nozzle. The objective {{of this research is}} to investigate the highest efficiency among different types of Pelton turbine through the modification of bucket volume, bucket angle attack, nozzle <b>needle</b> <b>seat</b> ring, and nozzle <b>needle</b> <b>seat</b> tip. The experiment was conducted at Energy Conversion Laboratory of Sebelas Maret University. The comparative study among the different parameters shows that the value of maximum efficiency was 21. 65 %, which was obtained at 90 ° <b>needle</b> <b>seat</b> ring and 45 ° <b>needle</b> <b>seat</b> tip, and + 15 % bucket size and 92 ° angle of attack. It was gained likely due to the lightness of the + 15 % bucket compared to the standard bucket and the collision produced by the jet water {{in the middle of the}} bucket, in which the water loading occupied the large area on the surface of the bucket and promoted the increasing speed. It is expected that the result on the appropriate size and angle attack of bucket at specific nozzle seat ring and seat tip of this experiment can be manufactured commercially in the future for achieving maximum Pelton turbine efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The onset and {{development}} of cavitation in the annular <b>needle</b> <b>seat</b> passage of piezo-driven outward-opening pintle injector nozzles used with spray-guided direct-injection gasoline engines are studied using a Eulerian–Lagrangian computational fluid dynamics cavitation model. Cavitation is formed because of the fluid acceleration taking place at the needle sealing area {{and it has been}} found to be affected by its geometric details. Various submodels for nucleation and bubble formation, further bubble growth and collapse, as well as bubble break-up and transport are incorporated into the model. Qualitative model validation is performed against experimental data reported elsewhere in large-scale nozzle replicas, showing similar cavitation patterns to be formed. These consist of vapour pockets rather than a con-tinuous vapour film and develop transiently in a rather chaotic manner around the circumfer-ential needle sealing area, even under stationary geometry and fixed-flowrate conditions. Further transient effects associated with the fast opening and closing of the piezo-controlled needle valve are also presented...|$|E

40|$|Reducing the sac volume size of medium-/heavy-duty {{diesel engine}} {{injector}} nozzles can minimise the fuel dripping into the combustion chamber {{at the end}} of injection events, which has been linked to reduced engine-out emissions. This study demonstrates the effect of reduction in the sac volume of diesel fuel injectors utilised in medium-/heavy-duty applications on the internal nozzle flow. This is realised by comparison of two heavy-duty diesel nozzles that feature a large difference in sac volume size of almost three times. For visualisation purposes, the nozzles have been enlarged by six times, and replicas were manufactured from a transparent material. High-speed digital imaging was used to capture the instantaneous spatial and temporal characteristics of geometric as well as dynamic vortex cavitation structures. The investigation was conducted in a steady-state flow test rig for three different needle valve lifts. For all tested conditions, the flow behaviour was analysed at three distinct areas of the nozzle, these being the <b>needle</b> <b>seat,</b> the sac volume and the injection hole. Interpretation of experimental observations was supported by parallel computational fluid dynamics simulations of the exact conditions measured during the experiments. Post-processing of the captured images has revealed the ensemble – average cavitation location, its standard deviation and the cavitation structures life – time inside the sac volume. Results showed a significant dependency of the internal nozzle flow on the sac volume size and identified clear differences {{in the structure of the}} cavitation pockets inside the sac volume under certain operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Fuel direct {{injection}} {{represents one of}} the key turning points {{in the development of the}} Diesel engines. The appeal of this solution has been growing thanks to the parallel advancement in the technology of the injection hardware and in the knowledge of the physics involved in the spray formation and combustion. In the present thesis, the effect of partial needle lift and injection rate shaping has been investigated experimentally using a multi-orifice Diesel injector. Injection rate shaping is one of the most attractive alternatives to multiple injection strategies but its implementation has been for long time impeded by technological limitations. A novel direct-acting injector prototype made it possible to carry out the present research: this injector features a mechanical coupling between the nozzle needle and the piezo-stack actuator, allowing a fully flexible control on the nozzle needle movement and enabling partial needle lift as well as the implementation of alternative injection rate shapes typologies. Different optical diagnostics were applied to study the spray development and combustion in a novel continuous flow test chamber that allows an accurate control on a wide range of thermodynamic conditions (up to 1000 K and 15 MPa). In addition, hydraulic characterization tests were carried out to analyze the fuel flow through the injector nozzle. Partial needle lift has been found to affect the injection event, reducing the mass flow rate (as expected) but also causing a reduction in the effective orifice area and an increase on the spreading angle. Moreover, at this condition, higher hole-to-hole dispersion and flow instabilities were detected. Needle vibrations caused by the needle interactions with fuel flow and by the onset of cavitation in the <b>needle</b> <b>seat</b> are likely the causes of this behavior. Injection rate shaping has a substantial impact on the premixed phase of the combustion and on the location where the ignition takes place. Furthermore, the results proved that the modifications in the internal flow caused by the partial needle lift are reflected on the ignition timing. On the other hand, the analysis of the experimental data through a 1 D spray model revealed that an increasing mass flow rate (e. g. ramp or boot injection rate profiles) causes an increase in the fuelair equivalence ratio at the lift-off length and a consequent higher soot formation during the diffusive phase of the combustion. Finally, the wide range of boundary conditions tested in all the experiments served to draw general conclusions about the physics involved in the injection/combustion event and, in some cases, to obtain statistical correlations.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work undertaken at the University of Brighton on a rapid compression machine {{based on}} a two-stroke diesel engine (Proteus) with an optical head to allow observation of the fuel spray. A long-tube, rate of injection rig {{was used to measure}} the injection rate of the fuel injection system. Quantification of cyclic variation and rate of injection were carried out for single and multiple-injection strategy. For multiple-injections, {{it was found that the}} injected mass of the first of the split was approximately 19 % less than that of the single injection strategy for the same injection duration. The second split reduction was less than 4 % in comparison to the single injection strategy. The transient response of the fuel injection equipment was characterised and compared with steady-state behaviour. The characteristics of the Proteus rig in terms of trapped air mass and transient incylinder temperature were investigated and quantified. The effect of in-cylinder temperature, density and pressure, as well as injection pressure on the characteristics of spray formation, for single and multi-hole nozzles were investigated using high speed video cameras. Cycle-to-cycle and hole-to-hole variations for multi-hole nozzles were investigated and attributed to uneven fuel pressure distribution round the <b>needle</b> <b>seat,</b> and subsequent cavitation phenomena. Simultaneous Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and Mie scattering techniques were used to investigate spray formation and vapour propagation for multihole nozzles for single and multiple-injection strategy. The multiple injection work focused on the effect of dwell period between each injection. Two different modes of flow were identified. These are described as 'wake impingement' and 'cavity mode wake effect', resulting in increased tip velocity of the second split spray. The increase in tip velocity depended on dwell period and distance downstream of the nozzle exit. The maximum increase was calculated at 17 m/s. A spray pattern growth for the second of the split injections, the 'exceed type' was identified, resulting from an increase in tip penetration due to air entrainment of the first split and propagation into the cooler vapour phase from the first split. The effect of liquid core length near the nozzle exit was investigated using modified empirical correlations and the evolution of the discharge coefficient obtained from rate of injection measurements. The results showed increased injection pressure and increased in-cylinder gas pressure reduce both break-up length and break-up time. Penetration was modelled using conservation of mass and momentum of the injected fuel mass. The input to the numerical model was the measured transient rate of injection. The model traced the centre-of-mass of the spray and was validated against PLIF data for centre-of-mass. Overall, the same value of modelling parameters gave good agreement for single and split injection strategy. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
50|$|The fuel {{injector}} valves {{are of a}} solenoid type with <b>needle</b> and <b>seat.</b> They are opened by a current flowing through the injector's coil and are closed by a strong spring when the current is switched off. To ensure as optimal combustion as possible and with that lower exhaust emission the injectors are equipped with four holes, which gives a good distribution of the fuel. The squirts of fuel are very exact positioned (two jets on the backside on each inlet valve). This put very high demands on the fixation of the injectors. To secure this fixation the injectors are fixed in pairs by a special retainer between cylinders 1 - 2 and 3 - 4. The injectors are electrically supplied from the main relay, while the ECU grounds the injectors.|$|R

40|$|Providing {{quantitative}} assessment of erosion in the various parts of a piping system is of considerable importance in the oil&gas industry. Field and lab erosion testing are extremely onerous and, for this reason, this task is typically achieved by means of algebraic erosion correlations in conjunction with CFD two-phase models based on the Euler–Lagrange approach for flow computation. However, the high computational burden makes this approach onerous even for relatively simple benchmark cases, and it cannot be actually applied in many practical applications. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to erosion prediction, which relies on the combined use of Euler–Euler and Euler–Lagrange CFD two-phase models. The strength of the proposed approach, compared to the standard practice, resides in its numerical efficiency, arising {{from the fact that}} the Lagrangian description of the solid phase is restricted to certain subdomains bounded by the surfaces most vulnerable to erosion. The outcomes of two application cases, namely an abrasive jet impingement test and a simplified model of a <b>needle</b> and <b>seat</b> choke valve, demonstrate that the new approach allows considerable reduction of the computational burden for particle tracking and wear estimation. This will open the way for addressing more complex flows of considerable interest in practical applications, which are actually precluded at present...|$|R
40|$|As vehicle {{emissions}} {{standards and}} fuel economy constraints become increasingly strict, {{the automotive industry}} must employ the use of advanced engine technologies to overcome these challenges. Fuel injection rate shaping and cylinder deactivation (CDA) are two such technologies, {{and both of them}} require the design and implementation of algorithms using various hardware and software tools. ^ Fuel injection rate shaping is one path towards cleaner and more efficient diesel engines. Piezoelectrically-actuated fuel injectors are well-suited for rate shaping operation, but are difficult to control. Control-related challenges arise primarily {{due to the lack of}} measurements available in a fuel injection system on-engine, the inherent complexity in the dynamics of a piezoelectric fuel injector, and variability from injector-to-injector and over the life of a given injector. Although these challenges are significant, model-based fuel flow rate estimation and control is of the utmost importance due to the fact that the brake torque in a diesel engine is primarily influenced by the total amount of injected fuel per engine cycle. This thesis studies the effect of injector model parameter uncertainties on the model-based estimate of the injector 2 ̆ 7 s output fuel flow rate. Specifically, the relationship between the injector 2 ̆ 7 s <b>needle</b> <b>seat</b> area and needle lift is investigated. While off-engine experiments can be conducted to determine this parameter, this study presents an on-engine parameter estimation strategy that can accommodate for some of the aforementioned injector variability. In the presence of an initial parameter error of 25 %, the parameter estimator improved the model-based prediction of total injected fuel by approximately 10 % in Matlab simulations. ^ CDA is another technology that enables improved fuel economy and reduced tailpipe emissions in diesel engines. As the name suggests, CDA involves deactivating some combination of an engine 2 ̆ 7 s cylinders in order to temporarily reduce the total displacement of the engine. Reduced engine displacement can improve fuel economy and reduce harmful engine emissions (by means of reduced air-to-fuel ratio and reduced pumping work), especially at low engine speed and load conditions. However, there are a few challenges that CDA presents. First, engine lubricating oil can accumulate in deactivated cylinders as time progresses. Second, cylinders may not perform normally immediately upon reactivation (a concept referred to as 2 ̆ 2 first-fire readiness 2 ̆ 2) due to this oil accumulation as well as low in-cylinder temperatures that are the result of a prolonged deactivation. Third, changing the combination of firing cylinders can yield undesirable torsional vibrations during CDA operation. This thesis analyzes the first and second of these issues using in-cylinder pressure measurements to study combustion in cylinders that have been reactivated after prolonged periods of deactivation. Experiments show that as more time is spent in CDA mode, more oil accumulates in deactivated cylinders. This oil accumulation can be as much as 500 mg for cylinders that have been deactivated for 20 minutes. CDA durations of 5 and 10 minutes yield accumulated oil masses of up to 376 mg and 255 mg, respectively, while a CDA duration of 0. 5 minutes yields an oil accumulation of less than 1 mg. Since the combustion of this accumulated oil causes abnormally large cumulative heat releases in the engine cycles following the transition from CDA to six cylinder mode, the brake torque does not smoothly transition between these two engine modes. For CDA times of 5, 10, and 20 minutes, these torque fluctuations make such long periods of CDA-only operation unacceptable from a first-fire readiness perspective. ^ Finally, this thesis presents a basic cylinder recharging strategy that can be used in future work to mitigate the effect of oil accumulation and improve first-fire readiness. While improvements in piston ring design can prevent oil accumulation, this cylinder recharging strategy uses software to reactivate all deactivated cylinders for a single engine cycle at regular intervals in an effort to raise in-cylinder pressures enough to prevent oil from seeping into deactivated cylinders. The ability to perform these 2 ̆ 2 recharge events 2 ̆ 2 has been added to the engine test cell used in this study and has been validated experimentally. Although CDA-only operation is unacceptable for periods of time greater than or equal to 5 minutes, CDA operation with regularly-spaced recharge events could enable prolonged CDA operation by mitigating the effects of oil accumulation and first-fire readiness. ...|$|E

40|$|Control valves often {{experience}} erosion {{produced by}} the impacts of solid particles within the flow. This {{is a very serious}} concern of engineers, as it causes downtime, loss of income, and high repair costs. Field and lab erosion testing are extremely onerous both economically and technically and, for this reason, the use of CFD techniques for erosion prediction is gaining ground in recent years. The standard practice involves the usage of two-phase CFD models which follow the trajectories of all solid particles within the flow. However, the huge computational burden of these models even for simple flows prevents, or even preclude, their application to complex flows of engineering interest such as valve flows. In this paper an innovative approach for erosion prediction is proposed. Its strength compared to the traditional practice resides in the numerical efficiency, arising from the usage of a different CFD two-phase method in which the detailed analysis of the fluid dynamics characteristics of the solid particles is restricted to the vicinity of the surfaces most vulnerable to erosion. This feature reduces considerably the computational burden of the erosion predictions in case of simple flows and, most important, makes it feasible to perform these estimations also in case of complex geometries such as control valves. In this paper, we discuss about the application of the method to sketched model of a <b>Needle</b> and <b>Seat</b> valve after its validation in abrasive jet benchmark tests...|$|R
