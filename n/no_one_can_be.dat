5|$|Rights of {{a person}} arrested under {{ordinary}} circumstances is laid down in {{the right to life}} and personal liberty. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested, the person has the right to defend himself by a lawyer of his choice. Also an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours. The rights {{of a person}} arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the Preventive Detention Act. Under preventive detention, the government can imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the Massachusetts {{legislature}} {{enacted the}} first {{plan in the}} United States to provide all Commonwealth citizens with universal health insurance coverage, {{using a variety of}} private insurance providers. Insurance coverage for low-income individuals is paid for with tax revenues, and higher income people who don't have health insurance are required to purchase it. (The health insurance market is publicly regulated, so, at least in Massachusetts, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or be forced to pay exorbitant rates.) The implementation of Commonwealth Care, the new universal coverage law, is proceeding, as of 2007.|$|E
25|$|Punishments are {{reserved}} {{to the legal}} authorities and false accusations are to be punished severely. It {{has been said that}} these legal procedural requirements were instituted to protect women from slander and false accusations: i.e. four witnesses of good character are required for conviction, who were present at that time and saw the deed taking place; and if they saw it they were not of good moral character, as they were looking at naked adults; thus <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> convicted of adultery unless both of the accused also agree and give their confession under oath four times.|$|E

25|$|The FBI, which {{continues}} to investigate the theft, has said {{it is no longer}} interested in identifying the thieves as the statute of limitations on the crime expired in 1996 and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> prosecuted for it (although those knowingly in possession of the stolen works could still be charged for that offense). However, it apparently does not put much credence in the theory that Donati was behind the crime. Kurkjian writes that he shared the details of his conversation with the FBI {{agent in charge of the}} investigation, but at a news conference a month later, the agent did not mention Donati at all and apparently seemed to still be embracing an earlier FBI theory of the crime.|$|E
25|$|With {{renewable}} {{water resources}} of only 125cubic meters per capita/year Yemen {{is one of}} the most water-scarce countries in the world. This level is less than one tenth of the threshold for water stress, which is defined at 1,700cubic meters per capita/year. Total water demand of 3,400 million cubic metres per year exceeds renewable resources of 2,500 million cubic metres per year, thus leading to a steady decline in groundwater levels, varying between 1m per year in the Tuban-Abyan area and 6–8m per year in the Sana’a basin. Today, there are between 45,000 and 70,000 wells in Yemen, the majority of which are under private control. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> certain of the exact number, as almost all were drilled without license. Agriculture takes the lion’s share of Yemen’s water resources, sucking up almost 90 percent, and it is estimated that qat production accounts for 37 percent of all water used in irrigation.|$|E
25|$|On {{the lower}} slopes of Devil's Peak, above Groote Schuur Hospital, an animal camp bequeathed to the City of Cape Town by Cecil John Rhodes {{has been used}} in recent years as part of the Quagga Project. The quaggas used to roam the Cape Peninsula, the Karoo and the Free State in large numbers, but were hunted to {{extinction}} during the early 1800s. The last quagga died in an Amsterdam zoo in 1883. In 1987 a project was launched by Reinhold Rau to back-breed the quagga, after it had been established, using mitochondrial DNA obtained from museum specimens, that the quagga was closely related to the plains zebra, and on 20 January 2005 a foal considered to be the first quagga-like individual because of a visible reduced striping was born. These quagga-like zebras are officially known as Rau quaggas, as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> certain that they are anything more than quagga look-alikes. The animal camp above Groote Schuur Hospital has several good looking Rau quaggas, but they are unfortunately not easily seen except from within the game camp, which is quite large and undulating, and the animals are few. The animal camp is not open to the public.|$|E

500|$|Protection {{with respect}} to {{conviction}} for offences is guaranteed in {{the right to life}} and personal liberty. According to Article 20, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> awarded punishment which is more than what {{the law of the land}} prescribes at that time. This legal axiom is based on the principle that no criminal law can be made retrospective, that is, for an act to become an offence, the essential condition is that it should have been an offence legally at the time of committing it. Moreover, no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. [...] "Compulsion" [...] in this article refers to what in law is called [...] "Duress" [...] (injury, beating or unlawful imprisonment to make a person do something that he does not want to do). This article is known as a safeguard against self incrimination. The other principle enshrined in this article is known as the principle of double jeopardy, that is, no person can be convicted twice for the same offence, which has been derived from Anglo Saxon law. This principle was first established in the Magna Carta.|$|E
500|$|The zombie {{argument}} {{is based on}} a thought experiment proposed by Todd Moody, and developed by David Chalmers in his book The Conscious Mind. The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and therefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states being associated with this body. Chalmers' {{argument is}} that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it. Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via physics, the move from conceivability to possibility is not such a large one. Others such as Dennett have argued that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent, or unlikely, concept. It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie {{is a product of the}} physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that [...] "Zombies think they are conscious, think they have qualia, think they suffer pains—they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition) in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Biographer Michael Welton (Little Mosie {{from the}} Margaree: [...] A Biography of Moses Michael Coady, 2001) depicts Coady as a flawed man. “Coady’s agonal {{last few years}} reflect, I think, a {{profound}} state of hubris. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> certain how Coady deceived himself into thinking {{that he had a}} divine mission to liberate the peoples of the world.” [...] Welton compares this millenarian mindset to that of contemporaries Hitler and Stalin. He writes that although Coady tried to mask his feelings behind a veneer of faith in democracy and ordinary people, the veneer wore thin later in his life, and Coady’s faith in others was replaced by a sense of betrayal and a tendency towards manipulation.|$|E

2500|$|Others such as Dennett {{have argued}} that the notion of a {{philosophical}} zombie is an incoherent, or unlikely, concept. In particular, nothing proves that an entity (e.g., a computer or robot) which would perfectly mimic human beings, and especially perfectly mimic expressions of feelings (like joy, fear, anger, ...), would not indeed experience them, thus having similar states of consciousness to what a real human would have. It is argued that under physicalism, one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie {{is a product of the}} physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's.|$|E
