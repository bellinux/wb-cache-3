5|$|Historian David Detzer {{has argued}} that the fame that {{surrounds}} the 11th <b>New</b> <b>York</b> is misplaced. During its time in service, the 11th <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Regiment saw little fighting compared to other well-known regiments such as the 69th <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> 20th Maine, and 28th Massachusetts. The 11th <b>New</b> <b>York</b> was often overshadowed by the 73rd <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> also known as the Second Fire Zouaves, which fought at Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox. In addition, Ellsworth failed to consider that the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City fire companies from which his troops were drawn often competed against each other at blazes. The cohesion he sought in firefighters did not exist and would not be created when they joined the regiment. In that respect, 11th <b>New</b> <b>York</b> was no different than many regiments, North and South.|$|E
