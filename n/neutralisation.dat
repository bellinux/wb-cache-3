5|$|The {{problem with}} {{enforcing}} a close blockade with ships was that warships loitering {{off the coast}} of Japan would be vulnerable to attack by aircraft and submarines. Blockading Japanese ports with small ships was a possibility, but this would first require the destruction or <b>neutralisation</b> of the Japanese fleet, and it was far from certain that the Japanese fleet would place itself in a position where it could be destroyed. A plan was adopted for a more distant blockade, whereby ships bound for Japan would be intercepted as they passed through the East Indies or the Panama Canal. This would not cut off Japan's trade with China or Korea, and probably not with the United States either. The effectiveness of such a blockade was therefore questionable.|$|E
5|$|As {{the sole}} viral protein {{on the surface}} of the virus, the Envelope protein is a major target for HIV vaccine efforts. Over half of the mass of the trimeric {{envelope}} spike is N-linked glycans. The density is high as the glycans shield the underlying viral protein from <b>neutralisation</b> by antibodies. This is one of the most densely glycosylated molecules known and the density is sufficiently high to prevent the normal maturation process of glycans during biogenesis in the endoplasmic and Golgi apparatus. The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on secreted or cell surface human glycoproteins. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that have so far been identified (from a subset of patients that have been infected for many months to years) bind to or, are adapted to cope with, these envelope glycans.|$|E

5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff adopted a plan that called for the <b>neutralisation</b> rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|In summary, the Fab {{region of}} the {{antibody}} determines antigen specificity while the Fc {{region of the}} antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and <b>neutralisation</b> (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).|$|E
5|$|The Persians had now {{captured}} most of Greece, but Xerxes had {{perhaps not}} expected such defiance from the Greeks; his priority was now {{to complete the}} war as quickly as possible; the huge invasion force could not be supplied indefinitely, and probably Xerxes {{did not wish to}} be at the fringe of his empire for so long. Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position had little chance of success; with the Allies now dug in across the isthmus, there was therefore little chance of the Persians conquering the rest of Greece by land. However, if the isthmus's defensive line could be outflanked, the Allies could be defeated. Such an outflanking of the isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the <b>neutralisation</b> of the Allied navy. In summary, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season. Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by destroying the Persian fleet, the Greeks could avoid conquest. In the final reckoning, both sides were prepared to stake everything on a naval battle, in the hope of decisively altering the course of the war.|$|E

Despite the growing body of evidence from recent studies to support the efficacy of ultrasound as visual biofeedback (U-VBF) in the remediation of persistent Speech Sound Disorders, they report mainly qualitative results of ultrasound data. This study uses both qualitative and quantitative measures to analyse ultrasound tongue images, while comparing tongue contours for velar and alveolar speech sounds in one child with persistent velar fronting. Perceptual analysis of acoustic data allowed the analyst determine perceptual categorical <b>neutralisations</b> of speech sounds to be recorded at various time points during (U-VBF) intervention. Ultrasound analysis allowed annotated tongue contours to be superimposed dynamically to identify differences in tongue shape and height over time when comparing contrastive speech sounds. Furthermore, it was hypothesised that undetectable error types in tongue shape for perceptually neutralised velar and alveolar target sounds would be identified using quantitative measures. To quantify the difference in tongue-height over time the built-in statistical difference function in Articulate Advanced Software (AAA) was used. Results show no evidence to suggest error types in tongue shape that differ from <b>neutralisations</b> that would otherwise be detected perceptually at any time point analysed in this study. Evidence does support increased acquisition of velar targets in various word positions at multiple time points progressively. Ultimately, this study offers evidence to contribute towards understanding the efficacy of U-VBF as a therapeutic technique in the remediation of persistent velar fronting...|$|R

Almost all replacements of charges in IS 4 and IIIS 4 decreased {{the slope of the}} Boltzmann curve of channel activation (activation curve) while charge <b>neutralisations</b> in IIS 4 and IVS 4 did not significantly affect the slope. S 4 mutations caused either left or rightward shifts of the activation curve, and in wild-type channels, these S 4 mutations hardly affected current kinetics. In slowly gating pore (S 6) mutants (G 432 W, A 780 T, G 1193 T or A 1503 G), <b>neutralisations</b> in S 4 segments significantly accelerated current kinetics. Likewise in wild type, charge replacements in IS 4 and IIIS 4 of pore mutants reduced the slope of the activation curves while substitutions of charges in IIS 4 and IVS 4 had less or no impact. We propose a gating model where the structurally different S 4 segments leave their resting positions not simultaneously. Upward movement of segments IS 4 and (to a lesser extend) IIIS 4 appear to be a rate-limiting stage for releasing the pore gates. These segments carry most of the effective charge for channel activation. Our study suggests that S 4 segments of CaV 1. 2 control the closed state in domain specific manner while stabilizing the open state in a non-specific manner...|$|R

To avoid <b>neutralisations,</b> speakers can only make use of their present phonological system of contrasts. Speakers of Old Alemannic (the dialect of Notker der Deutsche) had no contrast in voicing or fortis/lenis after the Second Consonant Shift had reduced the pre-OHG voiceless stops to fricatives and affricates. They had instead a quantity contrast, which they utilised to distinguish between an old coronal stop and a new one developed from *þ, thereby introducing a word-initial contrast only in coronal stops. This contrast was again later extended to other places of articulation through generations while adapting loans from donor languages which had a contrast in voicing. No new contrast was added due to loans. As a result, modern Alemannic dialects such as Thurgovian have a quantity contrast in stops in all positions of a word.

40|$|In Albanian, {{there is}} more than eight hundred Latin and Romance loanwords. The {{suggested}} chronological stratification is following: 1) Latin loanwords, 2) Balkan-Romance loanwords, 3) loanwords from the time of Via Egnatia and 4) Venetian loanwords.

Many loanwords went through dramatical phonetic development, which can be characterised by <b>neutralisations</b> and syncopes.

40|$|Illicit drugs occupy an {{ambivalent}} {{position in}} late modern society; one that {{revolves around the}} twin themes of pleasure and disapproval. Drawing on Freudian psychoanalysis and Eliasian sociology this article considers how people, particularly those who use drugs, negotiate such ambivalence. Patterns of drug use and associated attitudes are examined {{on the basis of}} the Crime Survey for England and Wales and a specialist survey of largely recreational drug users in the United Kingdom. Although illicit drugs have become increasingly familiar, their use is still widely thought to be harmful and morally dubious, creating a series of challenges for those who engage in such behaviour. Ambivalence among drug users is evident in an awareness of potential costs as well as benefits; a tendency to avoid more harmful substances; a general emphasis on moderation; and a desire to use less. Building on previous work, which highlights the role of <b>neutralisations</b> in sustaining drug using behaviour, particular attention is paid to users’ judgements about how their levels of consumption compare with other users. The analysis identifies a tendency among users to downplay their relative levels of use, which, it is argued, serves to shield them from some of the imperatives that may lead to decisions to cut down. As such, normalisation is said to be an intra-personal as well inter-personal process. The article concludes by discussing the potential of web-based personalised feedback as a harm reduction approach...|$|R
40|$|This thesis reports an {{exploratory}} ethnographic study into the daily lived experiences of residents charged or convicted of sexual offences and staff {{within a single}} Probation Approved Premises (hostel). The experiences and practice of residents and staff in the hostel are set {{in the context of}} work undertaken with sex offenders in the community. The study drew upon Foucauldian concepts of power relationships, Goffman's focus on daily `mundane' interactions and Sykes and Matza's techniques of <b>neutralisations.</b> In this analysis, practice in the community (such as the sex offender register, housing policy, supervision and the hostel) is regarded as part of wider control mechanisms as envisaged by Foucault. The findings are based on participant observation and interviews with hostel staff and residents conducted over two years, coupled with observation of twelve Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Committees (MARAC; over a one year period). In total, observations were conducted in the hostel on 85 occasions; the long time period being utilised to ensure observation of a range of sex offenders from entrance to the hostel to the point of returning to accommodation in the community. In-depth interviews were conducted with 24 residents in the hostel and 17 members of staff. In conjunction, conversations with residents and staff are reported as part of the participant observation work. The main findings are organised into three chapters: Hostel Practice, Hostel Life and The Hostel in Context. Within these, findings are discussed relating to: staff attitudes towards work in the hostel and with sex offenders; residents' attitudes towards aspects of hostel life such as the warning system, rules and moving out of the hostel; the use of space within the hostel; work towards reintegration; group structures and interaction; how residents represent themselves in the hostel, particularly relating to denial; and, finally, how hostel work is sited within a multi-agency structure. The findings are applicable to a wider debate regarding institutions and institutional life, but specifically contribute to knowledge about work with sex offenders, feeding into practice and policy. Alongside this, the methodology and fieldwork techniques contribute to academic and research discussions regarding ethnographic work, practice of conducting such fieldwork and the potential implications for the data collected...|$|R

Artillery-observation led to the <b>neutralisation</b> of German batteries, destruction of trenches and strong points and fleeting opportunities to bombard German troops in the open. British aircraft caused a feeling of defencelessness among German troops and deprived them of the support of the Fliegertruppen, leaving them dependent on wasteful unobserved area artillery-fire, while being vulnerable to British aircrew seeing muzzle-flashes giving away battery positions. Reinforcements of fighters were slow to arrive on the Somme and prevented the Fliegertruppen from challenging Anglo-French aerial dominance. The morale of British troops was correspondingly increased, that German artillery could not conduct observed shoots against them and that German troops could not move against them without being seen by the RFC.|$|E

The smaller area of operations at Cambrai and the growth of the RFC meant that more aircraft could be allotted to each task than in Flanders. The most notable difference in the air plan for the battle was in artillery co-operation, since air activity over the Cambrai area before the offensive, was restricted (along with the quantity of artillery and ammunition expenditure) to the usual amount to maintain secrecy, leaving no time before the battle for artillery registration. The positions of active German artillery batteries were to be observed once the battle began and prompt corrections to the artillery were to be given for counter-battery <b>neutralisation</b> and for destructive fire against groups of German infantry. Four squadrons of fighters were reserved for ground attacks against artillery, machine-gun nests and troops, according to a plan using lists of the most dangerous German artillery positions. Ground attack squadrons were given three groups of ground targets, to be patrolled all day and a forward aerodrome was established at Bapaume to allow aircraft to resume patrols and attacks quickly.|$|E
