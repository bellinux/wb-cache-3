During the 1970â€“1971 dry season, U.S. Air Force strike missions in support of Hmong operations had dropped by 70 percent {{from the previous year}} from 114 sorties per day to 38.

There are also several books, and considerable Internet activity.

In 2015 the UKTV series Myth Hunters (in the United States, airing on the American Heroes Channel) devoted one of its season 3 episodes to the topic.

25|$|When {{the fifteen}} round format was first {{introduced}} in September 2001, {{the composition of the}} rounds was different from that used by the programme today. The three sections each had five rounds, four letters rounds and one numbers round in each of the first two sections, with three letters rounds, one numbers round and the conundrum in the third section. This meant that there was a slight imbalance, whereby one contestant made the letters sections for six rounds, but had the choice of the numbers selection just once, whereas the other contestant chose letters five times and numbers twice. The dictionary corner guest's spot was immediately before the first advertising break, and Susie Dent's Origin of Words spot preceded the second <b>numbers</b> <b>game</b> shortly before the second break. The change to the present format was made on 25 March 2013, three weeks into the second section of Series 68, to comply with Channel 4's decision {{to increase the amount of}} adverts and alter the times when they occur during the programme, therefore reducing Countdown's actual show length from 36 to 35 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Marginalized in the {{legitimate}} economy, {{a small group}} of blacks found success outside the law, running gambling on numbers. Invented in 1920 or 1921, numbers had exploded by 1924 into a racket turning over {{tens of millions of dollars}} every year. That year the New York Age reported that there were at least thirty bankers (the name given to someone running a <b>numbers</b> <b>game)</b> in Harlem, with many employing between twelve and twenty people to collect bets, and Marcellino, the largest banker, employing over one hundred. By the late 1920s, Wallace Thurman guessed there were over a thousand collectors taking bets from 100,000 clients a day. The most successful bankers, who could earn enormous sums of money, were known as Kings and Queens. The wealthiest numbers king of all was almost certainly the reputed inventor of the game, Casper Holstein. He owned a fleet of cars, apartment buildings in Harlem and a home on Long Island, but did not have the ostentatious style and lifestyle of many other kings. He, and other bankers, gave money to charities and loans to aspiring businessmen and needy residents. Holstein's role in the community extended further than most of his colleagues, included membership in the Monarch Lodge of the Elks, support for Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, philanthropy in his native Virgin Islands, and patronage of the Harlem Renaissance.|$|E

500|$|After the Michigan/Big Ten {{investigation}} and the private investigation, no serious violations arose. For example, Robert Traylor, Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, and Maurice Taylor were cleared in October 1997. [...] In April 1999, the FBI and IRS raided several Detroit-area homes to stop a <b>numbers</b> <b>game</b> operation in the area's Ford plants. Martin's home {{was one of the}} targets; on April 28, he was found with a loaded gun, gambling records and $20,000 in cash in his home. [...] The authorities were investigating Martin's alleged <b>numbers</b> <b>game</b> operation at Ford plants and whether Martin had provided Michigan basketball players with money and gifts. [...] Another item that they seized was a Western Union MoneyGram from Martin to Traylor. In the course of a federal investigation, evidence turned up that Martin had given cash payments and other benefits to several Michigan players and Detroit-area high school prospects starting in the early 1980s. As a result of the investigations, in May 1999 a federal grand jury subpoenaed several Michigan basketball players to investigate the relationship between Martin and the basketball program.|$|E
