After the fair, the Playhouse became the Seattle Repertory Theatre; in the mid-1980s it became the Intiman Playhouse.

5|$|Even so, {{there is}} <b>no</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> {{criticism}} against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many {{critics argue that}} Beyonce {{is part of the}} hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the explosion of the porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality is, these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E
5|$|With no {{resources}} available from either Congress or the Continental Army, Irvine gave permission for volunteers to organize their own offensive. Detroit {{was too far}} and too strong for a small-scale operation, but militiamen such as David Williamson believed that an expedition against the American Indian towns on the Sandusky River was feasible. It {{was to be a}} low-budget campaign. Each volunteer had to provide at his expense a horse, rifle, ammunition, rations, and other equipment. Their only payment would be an exemption from two months of militia duty, plus whatever plunder might be taken from the Indians. Because of ongoing Indian raids—the wife and children of a Baptist minister were killed and scalped in western Pennsylvania on May 12, 1782—there was <b>no</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> men willing to volunteer.|$|E

50|$|War was {{declared}} on 4 August 1914. Good harvests and little interruption to imports of food {{during the first}} two years of meant that there were <b>no</b> <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> food. The agricultural situation then changed for the worse with a poor crop harvest, failure of the potato crop, declining harvest abroad and increased shipping losses. In 1916, Rowland Prothero was appointed President of the Board of Agriculture with a seat in the Cabinet and with the aim of stimulating food production.|$|R

In a statement, Israel’s Defense Ministry denounced her and her protesters as ‘‘provocateurs and known troublemakers” and called their effort a ‘‘failed publicity stunt.’’ The Defense Ministry explained that Israel exercised its right to deny them entry. ‘‘There are no restrictions whatsoever on bringing in school supplies,’’ the statement said. ‘‘If these activists sincerely wanted to bring in school supplies, they had countless options to do so.

25|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> {{myths about}} the origin of the Kadambas. According to one account the dynasty was founded by one Trilochana Kadamba also known from the Halsi and Degamve records as Jayanta who had three eyes and four arms. He was born out of the sweat of Shiva, which had fallen under a Kadamba tree and hence his name Kadamba.|$|E

But they would not get credit at reasonable rate, because banks were inaccessible to them. The lack of bank credit forced them to buy raw materials at exorbitant prices while they had to sell their products at depressed prices and forego expansion.|$|E

25|$|A {{convoy of}} {{ammunition}} and medical supplies, marching through the night, succeeded in reaching Es Salt in the morning, but the corridor {{of supply and}} retreat to the Jordan Valley was very narrow; being kept open only by hard fighting. The three days' rations, which each man had carried with him when the attack began, had now run out, but there was <b>no</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> water and good grazing for the horses as well as grain, and for the men raisins and fresh meat were requisitioned in Es Salt.|$|E

They never legalized their union and it ended around April 1828 in Vienna. Paganini brought Achilles on his European tours, and Achilles later accompanied his father until the latter's death. He was instrumental in dealing with his father's burial, years after his death.|$|E
40|$|Insofar as {{schizophrenia}} is a neuropsychiatric syndrome involv-ing the brain, neuropathology is a promising, if {{not essential}} inves-tigative approach. Although tradi-tional neuropathology {{has yet to}} yield a pathognomonic lesion in schizophrenia, there have been <b>no</b> <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> findings. Unfortu-nately, many of these findings have not only failed to be patho-gnomonic, {{but they have not}} been consistently replicated. Fortunately, newer neuropathological tech-niques, such as post-mortem neurochemistry, have resulted in findings among the most repro-ducible in schizophrenia research. Although one of these, increased dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia of schizophrenic patients, has been replicated many times, it suffers from doubts as to its clini-cal relevance. Are these increases in dopamine receptors primary to the illness or a side effect of the treatment? This article discusses the relevance of this finding, reviews other highlights of post-mortem neurochemistry and tradi-tional neuropathology, and dis-cusses new horizons such as autoradiography, immunocytochem-istry, and neuronal morphometrics...|$|R

50|$|While {{there was}} <b>no</b> {{physical}} <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> rice, increasing prices created a panic that supplies could not match demand. This fear was lessened when the United States allowed Japan to export unsold American rice (stockpiled in Japan {{because of a}} World Trade Organization decision). As of 16 May, anticipation of the move had already lowered prices by 14% in a single week. Although the rice from Japan was never actually sold or shipped, the world market price continued to fall every month of 2008 thereafter.|$|R
25|$|In 1939, the Indian Army was an {{experienced}} force, having {{fought in the}} Third Afghan War, two major campaigns in Waziristan, during 1919–1920 and 1936–1939, and in several smaller disputes on the North West Frontier since the First World War. There was <b>no</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> manpower to call upon, but the army did suffer from a shortage of skilled technical personnel. The conversion of the cavalry force into a mechanised tank force had only just begun and was hampered by the inability to supply adequate numbers of tanks and armoured vehicles.|$|E

The last established first-team player to make this move was Des Bremner in 1984, though there had been loan signings and movement of youth players during this period. The most recent permanent transfer from Aston Villa to Birmingham City was that of Craig Gardner during the 2009–10 season.

25|$|The Plano Real ("Real Plan"), instituted in {{the spring}} 1994, sought to break inflationary {{expectations}} by pegging the real to the US dollar. Inflation was brought down to single digit annual figures, but not fast enough to avoid substantial real exchange rate appreciation during the transition phase of the Plano Real. This appreciation meant that Brazilian goods were now more expensive relative to goods from other countries, which contributed to large current account deficits. However, <b>no</b> <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> foreign currency ensued because of the financial community's renewed interest in Brazilian markets as inflation rates stabilized and memories of the debt crisis of the 1980s faded.|$|E
50|$|Following upon this, Duby {{formulated}} {{a famous}} theory about the Crusades: that the tremendous {{response to the}} idea of holy war against the Muslims {{can be traced to the}} desire of disinherited (but well-armed) second and third sons of this French parvenue aristocracy to make their fortunes by venturing abroad and settling in the Levant. While Duby's theory had long-lasting influence, later scholars such as Jonathan Riley-Smith have done much to discredit it, arguing that there was <b>no</b> large-scale <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> land in Western Europe at the time, that knights actually lost money going on crusade, and that lay religious sentiment was their primary motivation.|$|R

50|$|It is {{difficult}} to pinpoint just how influential Nicholls {{has been to the}} All Blacks' style of play down the decades as even the exploits of other better-known players such as; George Nepia, Bert Cooke, Billy Wallace, Dave Gallaher and Billy Stead have been largely lost to most modern fans. Some modern rugby writers still rate Mark Nicholls as amongst the greatest All Black first five-eighths ever to play.
