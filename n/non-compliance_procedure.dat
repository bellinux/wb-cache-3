40|$|In this essay, {{the author}} assesses the {{operation}} of the <b>Non-Compliance</b> <b>Procedure</b> of the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer. Although in operation for only six years, the Procedure and its standing Implementation Committee have already made significant contributions to the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol. The Implementation Committee serves as a forum for discussing compliance-related issues; it has {{played a central role in}} managing individual cases of compliance. The author applies some lessons from the Montreal Protocol experience to the design of noncompliance procedures and similar mechanisms in other multilateral environmental agreements. He focuses on the Multilateral Consultative Process (Article 13) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ...|$|E
40|$|Due to its {{remarkable}} success, {{the model}} of the Montreal Protocol's <b>non-compliance</b> <b>procedure</b> (NCP) has been adopted in other environmental regimes, whose primary norms differ considerably. Hence, this article distinguishes different types of global environmental regimes and assesses the performance of NCPs therein as endogenous enforcement mechanisms. In fact, the reciprocal nature of the main conventional obligations in some more recent environmental regimes seems to hamper the effectiveness of compliance procedures. On this basis, the article puts forward some tentative considerations from a constitutional perspective. Drawing from the experience gained under environmental regimes in the region of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), it explores the feasibility of transplanting some aspects of {{the model of}} the Aarhus Convention NCP into the more complex global context. Further, it reflects upon the potential of enhancing synergies between NCPs and national and international judiciaries as a step towards the consolidation of international public law in this area...|$|E

40|$|The central {{question}} {{of this research}} is how to conceptualise more rigorously the processes of 'networked expertise' whereby scientists from different backgrounds are brought together to share their knowledge, in order to design innovative products and services. The study focuses on the coordination of collaborative expert teams, a growing issue in both the ongoing debate about the nature ofprofessionalism and the literature on innovation and economic development. The research was based on a longitudinal case study where ethnographic methods were used to document at a micro-genetic level the development of the practices of a multi-. professional research collaboration in the conte'St of the e-Science Programme in the UK. The scientific importance of the study lies in the choice of topic, the methodology @ employed, the context studied, and a synthesis of the literature on expertise from psychology and educational studies to organisational theory and innovation research. Critically engaging with Sociocultural Activity Theory, the main contribution of this research lies in characterising this form of collaborative working as a process of knowledge co-configuration between experts. The term is coined to capture the struggle and identity negotiations involved in knowledge sharing interactions between experts from different institutional backgrounds. This involved a process ofpractice development that enabled the collaborative team of experts to make the transition from uncreative to creative interaction. Engaging with three types of negotiation practices - articulation work, collaborative strategising and practice alignment - fostered the development of a practice platform necessary for knowledge co-configuration to occur. Identifying these three practices led to the theorisation of an emergent concept captured as 'balancing at the boundaries' between one's organisation and the new collaborative team, as an essential capacity that needs to be learned by actors to foster expert performance in this setting. Ultimately this thesis has been concerned with unravelling a paradox: the different experts are brought together to share their domain knowledge filtered through their experiences of work tasks; yet it is their situated understandings of work practices that become a major obstacle to moving the work forward in the collaborative team. The message, therefore, {{is that we need to}} move on from a conception of expertise as 'deliberative rationality' to a conception of expertise as purposeful relationality. Knowing when to act relationally, and when not, to foster productive work, is crucial, a further indication that this form of knowledge work is about engaging in a balancing act at organisational boundaries. Diplomatic Dispute Settlement - The Use of Conciliation and Analogous Methods Sven M. G. Koopmans, M. Jur. Magdalen College Oxford D. Phil. Trinity Term 2007 The diplomatic dispute settlement method of conciliation developed in the early 20 th century with the purpose of preventing wars, especially through settlement of 'political' or 'non-justiciable' disputes. Another rationale for conciliation was the avoidance of adjudication, by a method of assisted compromise. Nowadays it is thought that disputes are not incapable of judicial settlement because of a suppose~ inherent political or non-justiciable character. Further, a hundred years of conciliation has demonstrated that the method rarely prevents wars. Nevertheless, conciliation continues to be included in bilateral and multilateral agreements. It is occasionally used, often as a means to avoid adjudication. Types of conciliation must be distinguished. In the political type, conciliators recommend a settlement on political grounds. In law-based conciliation the commission provides a non-binding legal opinion. In mixed conciliation the conciliators make proposals based on a combination of legal and stipulated other grounds. Whereas conciliation originally was essentially political, in practice it was often law-based or mixed. This has had an effect on its use, and on the legal consequences of its application. Ã‚Â® The suitability of types of conciliation depends on the kind of dispute. In multilateral agreements, conciliation is frequently provided for as an alternative to compulsory adjudication. Aspects of law-based conciliation can then be introduced to promote that the norms of the regime are taken into account in finding a settlement. However, the alternative to conciliation, in the form of a <b>non-compliance</b> <b>procedure,</b> may in certain cases replace the use of conciliation. Inspiration for variations on conciliation can be found in commercial dispute settlement. However, the lack of practice of conciliation, combined with the many variations of existing conciliation mechanisms, indicates that the limited use made of conciliation is not a matter of available procedures, but of demand.

40|$|International law {{regulating}} {{the protection of}} the environment has grown exponentially over the years, with the adoption of many conventions covering the protection of specific environmental issues at the global, regional and bilateral levels. The variety of rules and types of protection is vast, and the question then is how to resolve potential conflicts. Within the field of interstate dispute settlement, the mechanisms that exist to solve international environment conflicts present a critical pressure point. Instead of a smooth process of adjudication, conducive to timely judgments that benefit all parties, a disjointed system offering more stumbling blocks than solutions seems to exist. There is this idea that the interstate judicial settlement is old-fashioned, and therefore inadequate to respond to the new legal developments in international environmental law. This pessimistic view on the existing mechanisms and the development of parallel theories on how to achieve greater compliance with environmental rules have consequently {{led to the creation of}} alternative types of conflict resolution mechanisms, labelled as <b>non-compliance</b> <b>procedures.</b> Indeed, it is true to say that the roles of international courts and tribunals in environmental disputes have been challenged by certain specific features of environmental disputes, bringing into question their usefulness and effectiveness. However, we should not be too hasty in dismissing the role of courts and tribunals in this context. This thesis seeks to investigate whether there is a place on the international stage for international courts and tribunals when it comes to solving environmental disputes. In doing so, the analysis focuses on the design of interstate adjudication and arbitration. Some judicial mechanisms which are often not considered could be adequately used in the context of international environmental law. By concentrating on the various relevant legal tools available to international judicial bodies, this thesis argues that international courts and tribunals can be used favourably in an environmental context. This thesis adopts three main perspectives from which the role of international courts and tribunals is assessed. First, the analysis concentrates on how the judicial procedures can be triggered (or the question “how to get in”). Then it looks at the mechanisms and procedural problems attached to the judicial bodies (or “once you are in”). Finally, the research focuses on the location of judicial bodies within the broader dispute settlement regime relevant for the application of international environmental law (or “in/out relationships”). With these three elements, it is then possible to evaluate the role international courts and tribunals play, their limitations and their advantages...|$|R

5|$|Due to the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, the exercise of the subjectively worded powers in the ISA is not judicially reviewable by the courts, except when {{there has been some}} <b>non-compliance</b> with the <b>procedures</b> set out in the Act. On the other hand, the objective test laid down in Chng Suan Tze continues to be the law governing judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under subjectively worded provisions in statutes other than the ISA. In Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal opined that the 1989 legislative amendments did not completely reverse Chng Suan Tze. Apart from restricting the courts' supervisory jurisdiction to reviewing decisions made under the ISA for procedural impropriety, Parliament did not disturb the principle laid down in Chng Suan Tze that the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion– that is, power without legal limits– is contrary to the rule of law, which demands that courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. Since Parliament did not undermine this principle when it legislatively reversed Chng Suan Tze, it should be taken to have implicitly endorsed the principle.|$|R
40|$|Purpose : Dry {{mouth is}} a common and {{troublesome}} symptom in palliative care. Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agent that promotes salivation. We aimed to test the effectiveness of pilocarpine drops compared to placebo, for participants with advanced cancer, who experienced dry mouth. Method : Aggregated n-of- 1 trials for patients of specialist palliative care services with advanced cancer assessed as having a dry mouth. Each participant was offered three cycles of pilocarpine drops 4 %, 6 mg tds (3 days) and placebo drops (3 days) in random order. Patients self-completed a diary using validated symptom {{and quality of life}} scores. The randomisation order was unmasked {{at the end of each}} person’s trial by a clinician independent of the trial to allow a treatment decision for individual patients to be made. Results : Twenty people were recruited to this pilot study, of whom five completed the planned three cycles; 36 cycles of data were completed in total. 438 doses of pilocarpine were administered. Most withdrawals related to deteriorating condition, unacceptable toxicity, <b>non-compliance</b> with study <b>procedures</b> or withdrawal of consent. Overall, no clinical difference in relief of dry mouth was noted on two measures of dry mouth, and an oral health related quality of life scale. Conclusion : The formulation of pilocarpine drops proved unacceptable to most participants. More work is required to determine an appropriate dose and method of delivery, then a retest of pilocarpine drops for this symptom...|$|R
40|$|Background A {{number of}} {{children}} are unable to comply with an MRI procedure and require general anesthetic. However, we lack information about which factors are associated with MRI compliance in young children. Objective To determine the strongest predictors of MRI compliance, focusing on variables {{that can be easily}} rated by patients’ parents. Materials and methods A sample of 205 children ages 3 – 11 years (mean age 6. 6 years) who were at risk of non-compliance were recruited from a children’s hospital. Their parents completed a behavior assessment scale for children as well as a questionnaire that assessed their expectations of compliance and perception of their child’s typical medical compliance. The children subsequently completed a mock MRI with an educational play therapist and a clinical MRI, with the quality of the scan scored by the MRI technologist. Results Overall, 88. 3 % of children complied with the clinical scan and achieved diagnostic images, with age unrelated to compliance in this well-prepared patient group. The strongest predictors of MRI compliance were parental expectations and ratings of how well the child typically copes with medical <b>procedures.</b> <b>Non-compliance</b> was related to child attention problems and to poor adaptability among children. A total of 64 preschool-age children (91. 4 %) and 110 school-age children (95. 7 %) were correctly classified as compliant or non-compliant based on these predictor variables. Conclusion A child’s temperament, medical experiences and parental expectations provide important information in predicting which children successfully comply with an MRI procedure and which require general anesthesia. Further study is needed to explore the utility of these variables in predicting compliance at sites that {{do not have access to}} an MRI simulator...|$|R
