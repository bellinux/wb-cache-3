5|$|The {{fuselage}} bomb bay used four bomb racks, {{in later}} versions eight modular standard bomb racks designed to carry one SC 250kg (550lb) bomb or four SC 50kg (110lb) bombs each in <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> orientation. These modular standard bomb racks were a common feature {{on the first}} generation of Luftwaffe bombers, but it turned out that they limited the ordnance selection to bombs of only two sizes. These racks were abandoned in later designs.|$|E
25|$|As {{the first}} officer radioed a Mayday call on the Air traffic control frequency, the pilot {{initiated}} a descent with a reduced airspeed of 110 kt while turning right towards the coast. Realizing they couldn't reach shore the crew prepared for ditching. At an airspeed of 86 kt with a 6.8 degree <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> and 3.6 degree left wing down attitude the aircraft impacted the water heading 109 degrees magnetic.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} primary avoidance/defense {{features}} on the Batman Forever version. First, it {{had the ability to}} lock all four wheels perpendicular to its centerline, to allow for quick sideways movement. Second, for more dire circumstances, the Batmobile could reroute the jet exhaust to under its front end and launch grappling cables at overhead anchors. With the <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> and the lines in place, the car could climb sheer vertical surfaces like building walls as if it were driving on flat ground.|$|E
5000|$|... 3 May 1963: a Convair 340-59 {{registration}} PP-CDW {{flying from}} São Paulo-Congonhas to Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont {{had to return}} to São Paulo after no.2 engine caught fire. When on finals to touch down, the aircraft <b>nosed</b> <b>up</b> 45°, stalled and struck a house. Of the 50 passengers and crew aboard, 37 died.|$|R
60|$|It quickly dawned upon Hare {{that the}} sheep were {{behaving}} {{in a way}} new and singular to him. They packed densely now, crowding forward, many raising their heads over the haunches of others and bleating. They were not in their usual calm pattering hurry, but nervous, excited, and continually facing west toward the canyon, <b>noses</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also making regular {{appearances}} are Rosie and Hugh Buckingham, Maggie and Andrew's best friends. Snobbish and child-free, they regularly {{turn their}} <b>noses</b> <b>up</b> at {{things such as}} pets, camping, and vacuuming whilst regaling Maggie and Andrew with their tales of their latest holiday, trip to the gym, or game of golf, depressing them with tales of the life they used to enjoy but never will again.|$|R
25|$|Mignet {{made the}} {{aircraft}} intentionally simple. The Flying Flea {{is essentially a}} highly staggered biplane, which almost could {{be considered to be}} a tandem wing aircraft, built of wood and fabric. The original design was a single-seater, and had two-axis flying controls. The aircraft had a standard control stick. Fore-and-aft movement controlled the front wing's angle of attack, increasing and decreasing the lift of the wing. Because the front wing was located forward of the center of gravity, that would pitch the <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> and down.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{believe that}} Hughes entered {{an area of}} deteriorating weather with low {{visibility}} and lost his visual reference with the ground. This induced spatial disorientation and eventually led to a graveyard spiral with the aircraft entering into a right-hand diving turn, with a nose-down attitude of 25°. When the aircraft cleared the clouds, Hughes attempted to arrest the high descent rate by pulling the <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> and applying full power, {{but it was too}} late. The FAA investigators later found evidence that the propeller was at maximum speed during impact.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly the {{downdraft}} dissipated rapidly from 50 fps to 0 fps in four seconds, {{this cause}} a {{rapid increase in}} the angle of attack and, as the result, the stick shaker was activated for approximately two seconds. It appeared that the Captain desperately {{tried to get out}} from the TAWS pull up warning, as he maintained a <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> input. Thus, the plane stalled. He heard the stick shaker warning and, to get out of it, he later maintained a nose down input. This input continued for the next few seconds. However, proper and complete Boeing stall recovery action remained not carried out.|$|E
60|$|Reined up to a brass ring {{on either}} side of their stalls with their noses towards the doors, they were always on view from nine to ten, and would stand with their necks arched, ears pricked, and coats gleaming, {{wondering}} about things, soothed by the faint hissing of the still busy grooms, and ready to move their <b>noses</b> <b>up</b> and down the moment they saw someone enter.|$|R
5000|$|Spin rate: faster spin {{rates will}} produce more {{gyroscopic}} drift because the <b>nose</b> ends <b>up</b> pointing {{farther to the}} side.|$|R
40|$|Over a {{few years}} of {{involvement}} in the aid sector in Asia, I became aware that aid workers turn their <b>noses</b> <b>up</b> at ‘English work’. Managers for my Australian government volunteering program encouraged us not to be sucked in to being human dictionaries while on NGO postings. In China, where I was, there was a bristling critique because USA’s Peace Corps volunteers were “only” sent to teach English: ‘How linguistically imperialist!’, we thought...|$|R
25|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{fairly quickly}} {{centered on the}} actions of the relief first officer, Gameel Al-Batouti, and this drew relatively minor criticism from the Egyptians. The NTSB determined that the only way for the observed split elevator condition to occur was if the left seat pilot (the captain's position) was commanding <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> while the right seat pilot (the first officer's position) commanded nose down. As the Egyptian investigation forwarded various mechanical failure scenarios, they were each tested by the NTSB and found not to match the factual evidence. The NTSB concluded that no mechanical failure scenario either they or the Egyptians could come up with matched the evidence on the ground, and that even if mechanical failure had been experienced, the 767's design made the situation recoverable.|$|E
25|$|The PW-4 {{was built}} for U.S. Navy Specification No. 96, calling for a carrier-based light fighter. This {{specification}} was eventually revealed as a cover for the Navy's actual desire for an airship fighter, the Curtiss XF9C. The XFA was a single-bay biplane with an all-metal fuselage and metal laminate skin. The construction of its fuselage was innovative in that instead of using lap jointing, the edges of each panel were bent inwards, with the rivets fastening them on the inside, instead of being visible on the surface. It had a gull-type upper wing which was fabric covered. The prototype was ordered in 1930, but the company was engaged in another reorganization, which delayed its work. Delivered for evaluations in 1932, it showed poor flying characteristics, including longitudinal instability and over-sensitive controls. General Aircraft increased {{the area of the}} tail surfaces and made other changes, then returned the prototype for more testing; but now the stability problems were worse. The plane would <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> with more throttle, but then drop its nose when the throttle was reduced. After another round of modifications, and some close calls, the plane was finally classed as unsafe and testing was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The {{autopilot}} {{reached the}} limits of its programming and disengaged. After checking their circuit breakers {{for the source of}} the warnings, the crew then reduced thrust to lower the speed. This immediately triggered the 757's stick-shaker stall alert, warning the confused pilots that the aircraft was flying dangerously slow, seconds after it was warning them that the speed was too high. The co-pilot and the relief pilot Muhlis Evrenesoğlu both seemed to recognise the approaching stall and tried to tell the captain, but did not intervene directly, possibly out of deference to the captain's age and experience. The captain then tried to recover from the stall by increasing the plane's thrust to full, but the plane was still in a <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> attitude, preventing the engines from receiving adequate airflow to match the increase in thrust. The left engine flamed out, which caused the right engine, still at full power, to throw the aircraft into a spin. Moments later, the plane inverted. At 11:47p.m., the Ground Proximity Warning System sounded an audio warning, and eight seconds later the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. All 13 crew members and 176 passengers were killed.|$|E
50|$|Eleven months later, on 9 November 1956, {{the second}} prototype, BuNo 138822, c/n XP-2, first flown on 18 May 1956, was also destroyed, {{due to a}} change made in the {{horizontal}} stabilizer control system without adequate evaluation before test flying the design. The crash occurred at 15:36 near Odessa, Delaware due to a faulty elevator jack. As the seaplane <b>nosed</b> <b>up</b> at ~21000 ft and {{failed to respond to}} control inputs, the crew of four ejected. The airframe broke up after falling to 6000 ft before impact.|$|R

25|$|The {{flight crew}} did not acquire any visual ground {{references}} before the approach was started. The aircraft started its final descent for landing too early. The aircraft had descended to 280 feet above ground when the terrain awareness and warning system sounded in the cockpit. The captain ordered a go-around and the autopilot was turned off. The first officer put {{the nose of}} the aircraft up for 4 seconds and the thrust levers were set to go-around power. The aircraft pitched up to 12.3° <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> and the flight crew raised the landing gear and flaps. Shortly thereafter the co-pilot started making nose down inputs which caused the aircraft to pitch-attitude to reduce to 3.5° nose down. (The co-pilot could have been focused on the aircraft's speed, rather than its altitude.) The go-around pitch attitude was not maintained and the instructions from the flight director were not followed. (The report says that fatigue could {{have played a role in}} causing the first officer to focus solely on the airspeed.) The captain and the first officer were making inputs to the aircraft's side stick at the same time (although the dual inputs were not sufficient to trigger a dual-input warning). This action appears to be intended to provide assistance by the captain to fly the aircraft. This action led to confusion on who was flying the aircraft. The ground proximity warning system sounded as the aircraft lost more height and the co-pilot responded with a sharp nose-down input. Then the captain took control of the aircraft without warning, via the side stick priority button and maintained the nose-down input, while the first officer was simultaneously pulling back on his own side stick. Two seconds before impact with the ground the aircraft was at 180 feet. The captain was also pulling his side stick fully back, suggesting both pilots were aware of the aircraft's impending collision with the ground.|$|E
500|$|The {{first officer}} {{said it was}} [...] "just like we lost lift." [...] As the captain {{attempted}} to level the wings, the crew used right rudder to manoeuvre the aircraft back toward the ground and avoid the water below. The accident report found that [...] "the first officer said that they seemed {{to agree that the}} airplane was not going to fly and that their control inputs were in unison." [...] Rachuba and Majure continued to try to hold the <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> to impact in a flat attitude, although Rachuba later stated that there were no [...] "heavy control inputs." [...] The final report further noted that [...] "first officer stated that he did not touch the power levers." [...] The first officer later told investigators that the flight crew's primary focus was to find a safe place to land.|$|E
500|$|Voss {{and the six}} {{remaining}} British aces swirled down to 600meters (2,000feet). At times, Voss had {{the altitude}} advantage over his foes, but {{did not try to}} escape the fight. Using the triplane's superior rate of climb and its ability to slip turn, Voss managed to evade his opponents and return to battle. He continued to flick turn at high speeds and attack those behind him. As Bowman later noted concerning his only shot at Voss: [...] "'To my amazement he kicked on full rudder, without bank, pulled his <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> slightly, gave me a burst while he was skidding sideways and then kicked on opposite rudder before the results of this amazing stunt appeared to have any effect on the controllability of his machine." [...] Bowman's machine was left slowed and ineffectively trailing dark smoke and steam, though he stayed in the fight.|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{knowledge}} of bootlegs {{and where to}} purchase them spread by word of mouth. The pioneering bootlegger Rubber Dubber sent copies of his bootleg recordings of live performances to magazines such as Rolling Stone {{in an attempt to}} get them reviewed. When Dylan's record company, Columbia Records objected, Rubber Dubber counteracted he was simply putting fans in touch with the music without the intermediary of a record company. Throughout the 1970s most bootleg records were of poor quality, with many of the album covers consisting of nothing more than cheap photocopies. The packaging became more sophisticated {{towards the end of the}} decade and continued into the 1980s. Punk rock saw a brief entry into the bootleg market in the 1970s, particularly the bootleg Spunk, a series of outtakes by The Sex Pistols. The album received a good review from Sounds' Chas de Whalley, who said it was [...] "an album that no self-respecting rock fan would turn his <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> at." ...|$|E
500|$|Lockheed and the Army held a 13-minute {{demonstration}} [...] "first flight" [...] for {{the public}} at the Van Nuys Airport on 12 December 1967. During the flight, the Cheyenne demonstrated {{some of the new}} capabilities brought about by the thrusting propeller; the helicopter could slow down or accelerate without pitching the <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> or down, as well as being able to pitch the nose down or up at a hover, without causing the aircraft to accelerate forwards or backwards. The Cheyenne demonstrated a stationary hover in a 30-knot (35mph, 56km/h) crosswind, {{and at the end of}} the flight landed on its two forward landing gear, [...] "bowed" [...] to the audience and then gently set the tail landing gear down as it taxied to parking. [...] By March 1968, the AH-56 had established a flight envelope of 170knots (196 mph, 315km/h) in forward flight, 25knots (29mph, 46km/h) sidewards, and 20knots (23mph, 37km/h) rearwards.|$|E
500|$|TechTV criticized it {{as being}} less [...] "addictive or diverse as the great pinball videogames", though noted it to be fun for those looking for a Pokémon title. Game Informer praised its ball physics and controls, calling them [...] "dead on". GameSpy's Darryl Vassar gave similar praise, {{describing}} the game as a [...] "blast". He added that it had surprising depth. GamePros [...] "Dan Elektro" [...] commented that Ruby & Sapphire would not interest {{those who do not}} have interest in the series, but fans of the series would enjoy its [...] "unusually satisfying" [...] gameplay. Games(TM) praised it for combining pinball and Pokémon, adding that the pinball gameplay {{would be more likely to}} draw those who are not fans of the series into playing Pokémon more so than the adventure games. Eurogamer's Martin Taylor commented that only the [...] "most demanding of pinball wizards would be right to turn their <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> at Pokemon Pinball's charming slant on the genre." [...] Computer and Video Games praised it for its broad appeal, commenting that it is [...] "fast and fluid for the casual player, yet has collecting and evolving for the obsessive." [...] Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire has been compared to other pinball video games, including Mario Pinball Land, which GameAxis Unwired treats as an inferior to Ruby & Sapphire. Eurogamer described Ruby & Sapphire as a spiritual predecessor to Metroid Prime Pinball.|$|E

The resulting orientation of Body 3-2-1 sequence (around the capitalized axis in the illustration of Tait-Bryan angles) is equivalent to that of lab 1-2-3 sequence (around the lower-cased axis), where the airplane is rolled first (lab-x axis), and then <b>nosed</b> <b>up</b> around the horizontal lab-y axis, and finally rotated around the vertical lab-z axis (lB = lab2Body): ...|$|R

2500|$|Extensive stall [...] {{and spin}} testing {{was carried out}} at Wizard Lake on 28 December 1982. Straight-ahead and turning power off stalls {{resulted}} in a stable mush condition. Power-on stalls from 30 degrees <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> resulted in a +15 degree <b>nose</b> <b>up</b> stable mush, with no wing drop tendency.
