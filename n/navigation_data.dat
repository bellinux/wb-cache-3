5|$|MRO science {{operations}} were initially scheduled to last two Earth years, from November 2006 to November 2008. One of the mission's main {{goals is to}} map the Martian landscape with its high-resolution cameras in order to choose landing sites for future surface missions. The MRO {{played an important role}} in choosing the landing site of the Phoenix Lander, which explored the Martian Arctic in Green Valley. The initial site chosen by scientists was imaged with the HiRISE camera and found to be littered with boulders. After analysis with HiRISE and the Mars Odyssey's THEMIS instrument a new site was chosen. Mars Science Laboratory, a highly maneuverable rover, also had its landing site inspected. The MRO provided critical <b>navigation</b> <b>data</b> during their landings and acts as a telecommunications relay.|$|E
25|$|The bomber {{carrying}} the missile was modified {{with an additional}} antenna and equipment at the bombardier's position needed to guide the RASCAL. During the flight to the launch point, the bombardier transferred wind and <b>navigation</b> <b>data</b> periodically to the missile. Prior to launch the bombardier tuned a video relay receiver, altitude phasing, and adjusted the terminal guidance tracking indicator. Missile control surfaces were also checked {{to make sure they}} were functional.|$|E
25|$|The more {{accurate}} high-precision signal {{is available for}} authorized users, such as the Russian Military, yet unlike the US P(Y) code, which is modulated by an encrypting W code, the GLONASS restricted-use codes are broadcast in the clear using only security through obscurity. The details of the high-precision signal have not been disclosed. The modulation (and therefore the tracking strategy) of the data bits on the L2SF code has recently changed from unmodulated to 250 bit/s burst at random intervals. The L1SF code is modulated by the <b>navigation</b> <b>data</b> at 50 bit/s without a Manchester meander code.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the descent, Aldrin {{had called}} out <b>navigation</b> <b>data</b> to Armstrong, who was busy {{piloting}} the LM. A few {{moments before the}} landing, a light informed Aldrin {{that at least one}} of the [...] probes hanging from Eagle footpads had touched the surface, and he said: [...] "Contact light!" [...] Three seconds later, Eagle landed and Armstrong said [...] "Shutdown." [...] Aldrin immediately said [...] "Okay, engine stop. ACA – out of detent." [...] Armstrong acknowledged [...] "Out of detent. Auto" [...] and Aldrin continued [...] "Mode control – both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine arm – off. 413 is in." ...|$|E
500|$|The game opens just {{following}} {{the events of}} , as the Pillar of Autumn exits slipspace near a mysterious ring-shaped space station, called [...] "Halo" [...] by the enemy in the game, the Covenant. A Covenant fleet attacks and heavily damages the Pillar of Autumn. Captain Keyes initiates [...] "The Cole Protocol," [...] a procedure which destroys all <b>navigation</b> <b>data</b> and is designed to prevent the Covenant from learning the location of Earth. Master Chief and Cortana fight their way to an escape pod, where they eject from the ship along {{with a group of}} Marines. As they fly away they can see Keyes attempting to crash land Pillar on Halo.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is played}} {{primarily}} through [...] "pointing and clicking" [...] with the mouse and a few keyboard commands. This system {{is also used to}} control the spacecraft, a breakaway from the traditional use of joysticks for space flight simulators. Observing their spacecraft from the rear, players fly their ships by moving the mouse in the direction they want the vessels to go. Freelancers spacecraft follow simplistic flight dynamics; however, a dash of realism is implemented by allowing the vessels to cut power to their engines and turn to face any direction while drifting along their original pathconservation of momentum. Clicking the mouse button shoots the ship's weapons at the location of the cursor. The interface has no radar display; the location of objects not shown on the screen are indicated by pointers at the screen's edges.

500|$|During the Apollo 13 crisis, Lunney {{played a}} key role. Coming on shift {{an hour after the}} oxygen tank {{explosion}} that put the crew's lives in jeopardy, Lunney and his team faced the unprecedented challenge of having to power up the lunar module on an extremely tight timeline, while transferring guidance and <b>navigation</b> <b>data</b> to it from the dying command module. His excellent memory and quick thinking were critical in the success of his team during the ensuing hours. Ken Mattingly, the astronaut who had been bumped from the Apollo 13 crew due to his exposure to German measles, later called Lunney's performance [...] "the most magnificent display of personal leadership that I’ve ever seen". On the day following the Apollo 13 splashdown, Lunney joined his fellow flight directors in accepting the Presidential Medal of Freedom {{as a member of the}} Apollo 13 mission operations team. The award was made by President Nixon during a ceremony at the Manned Spacecraft Center.|$|E
500|$|During six flybys of Titan from 2006 to 2011, Cassini {{gathered}} radiometric {{tracking and}} optical <b>navigation</b> <b>data</b> from which investigators could roughly infer Titan's changing shape. The density of Titan {{is consistent with}} a body that is about 60% rock and 40% water. The team's analyses suggest that Titan's surface can rise and fall by up to 10 metres during each orbit. That degree of warping suggests that Titan's interior is relatively deformable, and that the most likely model of Titan is one in which an icy shell dozens of kilometres thick floats atop a global ocean. The team's findings, together with the results of previous studies, hint that Titan's ocean may lie no more than [...] below its surface. On July 2, 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be as salty as the Dead Sea. On September 3, 2014, NASA reported studies suggesting methane rainfall on Titan may interact with a layer of icy materials underground, called an [...] "alkanofer," [...] to produce ethane and propane that may eventually feed into rivers and lakes.|$|E
