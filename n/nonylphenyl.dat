40|$|Variola major, the causative {{agent of}} smallpox, has been {{eradicated}} from nature. However, stocks still exist; thus, {{there is a}} need for relevant decontamination studies, preferably with nonpathogenic simulants. Previous studies have shown a similarity in response of vaccinia virus and variola major to various decontaminants and thermal inactivation. This study compared vaccinia and fowlpox viruses under similar conditions, using disinfectants and temperatures for which variola major data already existed. Most disinfectants showed similar efficacy against vaccinia and fowlpox, suggesting the utility of fowlpox as a decontamination simulant. Inactivation kinetics studies showed that fowlpox behaved similarly to variola major when treated with 0. 1 % iodine and 5. 7 % polyethyleneglycol <b>nonylphenyl</b> ether, 0. 025 % sodium hypochlorite, 0. 05 % sodium hypochlorite, and 0. 1 % cetyltrimethylammonium chloride and 0. 05 % benzalkonium chloride, but differed in its response to 0. 05 % iodine and 0. 3 % polyethyleneglycol <b>nonylphenyl</b> ether and 40 % ethanol.

40|$|Nanosize {{molybdenum}} trisulfide, MoS 3, was synthesized in a polyoxyethylene(2) <b>nonylphenyl</b> ether/cyclohexane/water microemulsion by acidifying ammonium tetrathiomolybdate solubilized in {{the water}} cores of inverse micelles. MoS 3 was also prepared by thermal decomposition for comparison. X-ray diffraction, TEM, and electrochemical testing characterized the molybdenum trisulfide. By comparing the cyclic voltammetry results on MoS 3 and S electrodes in lithium cells, the conclusions about the structure of MoS 3 from previous research work have been confirmed. That is, the molybdenum trisulfide molecules were not a mixture of MoS 2 and elemental S. Molybdenum trisulfide exists as Mo 3 S 9 clusters, which are, in turn, linked by bridging SS bonds...|$|E

The synthesis of fine oxide particles has been reported recently via a reverse micelles (RM) method {{and can be used}} to pre-pare nanometer-sized, uniform particles of metals and metal oxides, because the particle-forming reactions usually occur within the nanometer-sized reverse micelles. 23 - 29 However, {{there are only a few}} reports on the preparation of mixed metal oxides 25, 26 or supported metal oxides by this method. 28 The aim of this study is to investigate the application of this method to the preparation of a carbon-sup-ported Mn-based perovskite-type oxide. Experimental The preparation of carbon-supported perovskite type-oxide (LaMnO 3 + d) using an RM method is schematically shown in Fig. 1.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} a surfactant-assisted sonochemical approach to produce monodisperse Fe 3 O 4 nanoparti-cles (NPs). The non-ionic surfactant Igepal CO- 520 (Poly(oxyethylene) (5) <b>nonylphenyl</b> ether) {{has been used}} for the preparation of NPs and the effects on the NP size, size distribution, and magnetic properties have been studied. The Fe 3 O 4 NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The results reveal that the NPs prepared by a Igepal CO- 520 -assisted sonochemical method exhibit a narrow range of size distributions and a high monodispersity compared to the NPs from the conventional sonochemical method. The analysis of NPs prepared {{in the presence of the}} surfactant suggested that it could be used not only as a protector to prevent the oxidation of Fe (II), but also as a controller to vary the size of the NPs...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} synthesis protocols {{were used}} to synthesize nanosize molybdenum sulfide particles in the microemulsion system polyoxyethylene(5) <b>nonylphenyl</b> ether (NP- 5) /cyclohexane/water: (a) acid-solubilized microemulsion plus tetrathiomolybdate (ASMPT), (b) tetrathiomolybdate-solubilized microemulsion plus acid (TSMPA) and (c) microemulsion plus microemulsion (MPM), i. e., acid-solubilized microemulsion plus tetrathiomolybdate-solubilized microemulsion. The particle size was found {{to depend on the}} synthesis method, especially at water-to-surfactant molar ratios (R) greater than 2. 5. At R= 3. 5 - 4. 5, the average particle size increased according to the synthesis method in the order: ASMPT < MPM < TSMPA. Furthermore, for each synthesis protocol, the average particle diameter increased with the water-to-surfactant molar ratio (R). These trends are rationalized by considering: (a) the increase in the rate of exchange of materials between the inverse micelles as R is increased, and (b) the different effects of the electrolytes (i. e., sulfuric acid and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate plus sodium hydroxide) on microemulsion stability...|$|E
30|$|Several routes were {{employed}} for obtaining the water-soluble functionalized iron oxide NPs. One {{method is to}} directly add the biocompatible small organic molecules such as amino acid [45], citric acid [43, 46], vitamin [47, 48], cyclodextrin [49 – 51], etc. during the synthesis procedure. Recently Xia et al. [52] reported a facile synthetic approach for preparing water-soluble Fe 3 O 4 NPs with a surrounded layer by use of polyethylene glycol <b>nonylphenyl</b> ether (NP 5) and cyclodextrin (CD) in aqueous medium. Moreover, the author had also built nanostructured spherical aggregates (mosaic type structure) from individual functionalized NPs (core-shell type structure) and which can be tailored by the concentration of NP 5 and CD. These mesoporous aggregates of magnetite NPs {{can be used in}} magnetic carrier technology. Though this direct method has many advantages, owing to small organic molecules do not have good stability especially in an alkaline or acidic environment, it often decomposes and results in the functionalized iron oxide NPs agglomeration. Furthermore, the morphology of functionalized iron oxide NPs often presents as an aggregate clusters.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} has been {{developed}} for partial purification of cytochrome P- 450 from phenobarbital-induced rabbit liver microsomes. The cytochrome was solubilized with 0. 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7. 25) containing 0. 4 % sodium cholate, 20 % glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM EDTA. The solubilized hemoprotein was adsorbed on a column of an a-amino-n-octyl derivative of Sepharose 4 B and then eluted with 1 mM Emalgen 913 (a polyoxyethylene <b>nonylphenyl</b> ether) in the same buffer. This method permitted us to purify cytochrome P- 450 to a specific content of 8 — 10 nmoles per mg of protein (40 — 50 % pure assuming a molecular weight of 50, 000 for the cytochrome) with an overall yield of about 35 %. The purified preparation was free from both cytochromes bt and P- 420. Its spectral properties were consistent with those reported for the microsomal bound form of cytochrome P- 450 and superior in several respects {{to those of the}} partially purified preparations of the cytohcrome so far described.

40|$|The {{formation}} of silica particles by the ammonia-catalyzed hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in the polyoxyethylene (5) <b>nonylphenyl</b> ether (NP- 5) /cyclohexane/water microemulsion system was investigated by time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The SAXS data could be modeled {{as a combination}} of two species where one describes the silica-particle containing microemulsion droplets and the other the reverse droplets. The analysis allowed {{the determination of the}} evolution of the system of particles of silica and reverse droplets. A model of nucleation and growth of the silica particles is confirmed and the volume fraction versus time data for the silica particles is in agreement with first order kinetics with respect to TEOS concentration. Moreover to describe the long time evolution of the system, a correlation among the silica particles has been taken into account by introducing a structure factor with a local silica volume fraction η = 0. 1. This high local density is 2 orders of magnitude larger than the global silica fraction and can be explained in terms of depleting interaction...|$|E

30|$|Molten salt {{synthesis}} (MSS) {{method is}} {{an effective way to}} prepare perovskite oxide electronic ceramic powders, which involves molten salt used as the medium for synthesizing pure perovskite oxides from their constituent materials (oxides and carbonates) at a relatively low temperature and in a shorter reaction time as compared with the conventional solid-state reactions [13]. Recently, perovskite PTO powders are synthesized by molten flux reaction using NaCl and NaCl-KCl as the reaction media [14 – 16]. The formation of spherical PTO powders was achieved by the dissolved PbO diffusing onto the TiO 2 surface in the molten salts and reacting in-situ to form PTO nanoparticles, and then following the nucleation and growth of PTO nanoparticles. As compared with the PTO powders, the synthesis of PTO 1 D nanomaterials (e.g., nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes) by MSS method has lingered far behind. The main reason is due to the challenges in synthesizing high-quality PTO 1 D nanomaterials because the high symmetry of the perovskite structure can easily lead to PTO growing into a cubic block. To date, only a few works about the synthesis of PTO 1 D nanomaterials by MSS method are available in the literature. Deng et al. [17] synthesized PTO nanorods with diameters of 50 – 80 [*]nm and lengths of a few micrometers at 700 [*]°C by using a surfactant (polyoxyethylene (9) <b>nonylphenyl</b> ether, NP- 9)-assisted approach in a NaCl molten salt medium. The growth of the PTO nanorods was attributed to the dispersion of fine PTO nanoparticles and their re-deposition on larger particles, leading to the formation of nanorods along the axial direction under the combination effects of NP- 9 surfactant and flux of NaCl. Cai et al. [15] reported on the synthesis of single-crystalline PTO nanorods with diameters of 0.1 – 1.0 [*]μm and lengths of up to a few micrometers by template MSS method, where NP- 9 was used as a surfactant and the rod-shaped TiO 2 precursors were used as the templates for titanium sources. The size and morphology of the rod-shaped TiO 2 templates were retained in the synthesized PTO particles. Similarly, needle-like PTO powders were also synthesized via template MSS method, where pure needle-like TiO 2 particles were used as the templates [18]. The needle-like PTO particles synthesized by template MSS method at 800 [*]°C had a length of 30 – 100 [*]μm and diameters of 500 [*]nm– 2.0 [*]μm.|$|E
