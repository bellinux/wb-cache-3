2500|$|One <b>novel</b> <b>model</b> was the 2CV Sahara, a {{four-wheel drive}} (4×4) car, {{equipped}} with two engines (12hp each), each one having a separate fuel tank. One was {{mounted in the}} front driving the front wheels {{and one in the}} back driving the rear wheels. A single gearstick, clutch pedal and accelerator were connected to both engines. It was originally intended for use by the French colonies in Northern Africa. As well as a decreased chance of being stranded, it provided four-wheel-drive traction with continuous drive to some wheels while others were slipping because the engine transmissions were uncoupled. Therefore, it became popular with off-road enthusiasts. Between 1958 and 1971, Citroën built 694 Saharas. The top speed was [...] on one engine, and [...] with both engines running. These rare vehicles are highly collectible.|$|E

McInerney (a friend of Ellis) noted the novel's comparative darkness {{to his own}} Model Behaviour (also about 90s nightlife and [...] supermodels), published the same year, saying [...] "I deliberately wrote a comic novel because you don't go chasing butterflies with sledgehammers". (Regarding McInerney's novel, Stein had felt that the novelist's attempt at a zeitgeist novel was one [...] "looking at the '90s through an '80s lens".) Harvard Crimson noted, similar to McInerney, that [...] "Celebrity by itself teeters so often into self-parody that it seems too easy to bash it" [...] but remarks that [...] "Fortunately, Ellis does more than that injecting Glamorama with a sharper plot than those of earlier novels, a plot which kicks in {{about a quarter of}} the way into the novel." [...] The New York Times question the choice of subject matter as well: [...] "Ellis's satirical message is, essentially, a one-liner, and hardly an original one at that – celebrity culture is vapid, yes, and?"

40|$|A novel {{experimental}} paradigm and a <b>novel</b> <b>modelling</b> approach {{are presented}} to investigate oscillatory human motor performance {{by means of}} a key concept from condensed matter physics, namely, thermodynamic state variables. To this end, in the novel experimental paradigm participants performed pendulum swinging movements at self-selected oscillation frequencies in contrast to earlier studies in which pacing signals were used. Moreover, in the <b>novel</b> <b>modelling</b> approach, a canonical-dissipative limit cycle oscillator model was used with a conservative part that accounts for nonharmonic oscillator components in contrast to earlier studies in which only harmonic components were considered. Consistent with the Landau theory of magnetic phase transitions, we found that the oscillator model free energy decayed when participants performed oscillations further and further away from the Hopf bifurcation point of the canonical-dissipative limit cycle oscillator.

50|$|A lot of models/algorithms {{have been}} {{implemented}} to retrieve and classify {{a certain type of}} data, e.g. image or text (where humans who interacts with machines can extract images in a form of pictures and text that could be any message etc). However, data usually comes with different modalities (it {{is the degree to which}} a system's components may be separated or combined) which carry different information. For example, it is very common to caption an image to convey the information not presented by this image. Similarly, sometimes it is more straightforward to use an image to describe the information which may not be obvious from texts. As a results, if some different words appear in similar images, these words are very likely used to describe the same thing. Conversely, if some words are used in different images, these images may represent the same object. Thus, it is important to invite a <b>novel</b> <b>model</b> which is able to jointly represent the information such that the model can capture the correlation structure between different modalities. Moreover, it should also be able to recover missing modalities given observed ones, e.g. predicting possible image object according to text description. The Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine model satisfies the above purposes.|$|E
