40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to design a new {{mechanical}} <b>nesting</b> <b>system</b> based on scientific works on the behavior of laying hens, and to compare its performance with that of a hand-operated Dutch nest. The equipment was assessed in two poultry houses; in the first one, the eggs were collected manually, whereas in the second one, the newly designed mechanical nest was used for the collection. A total of 7, 800 hens and 800 males were housed in each poultry house, and the percentages of eggs produced, nest dirty eggs, floor eggs, and cracked and discarded eggs were determined between weeks 25 and 52. The percentage of eggs with microcracks, infertility, embryo mortality, bacterial contamination, fungal contamination, chicks with stunting syndrome and hatching from both types of nest was assessed in the hatchery on a fortnightly basis. The mechanical nest designed herein proved to be a good alternative to the hand-operated Dutch nest, but it still has to be improved in order to have the same performance, especially with regard to reduction in the incidence of floor eggs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{economy of}} the process for the {{manufacture}} of parts from sheet metal plates depends on successful solution {{of the process of}} cutting various parts from sheet metal plates. Essentially, the problem is to arrange contours within a defined space so that they take up minimal surface. When taken in this way, the considered problem assumes a more general nature; it refers to the utilization of a flat surface, and it can represent a general principle of arranging 2 D contours on a certain surface. The paper presents a conceptual solution and a prototypal intelligent <b>nesting</b> <b>system</b> for optimal cutting. The problem of nesting can generally be divided into two intellectual phases: recognition and classification of shapes, and arrangement of recognized shapes on a given surface. In solving these problems, methods of artificial intelligence are applied. In the paper, trained neural network is used for recognition of shapes; on the basis of raster record of a part's drawing, it recognizes the part's shape and which class it belongs to. By means of the expert system, based on rules defined on the basis of acquisition of knowledge from manufacturing sections, {{as well as on the}} basis of certain mathematical algorithms, parts are arranged on the arrangement surface. Both systems can also work independently, having been built on the modular principle. The system uses various product models as elements of integration for the entire system...|$|E

Ten separate 30 -day DARLAM simulations were performed for both January and July with a resolution of 125 km and were averaged to obtain a climatology for those months. This paper presents {{for the first time}} simulations of the January South American climate using a limited area model; previous similar studies simulated only the July climate. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine the capability of the CSIRO Mk 2 - DARLAM nested modeling system for simulating the climate in the South American region. Further, it was desired to investigate whether the higher resolution of DARLAM improves the simulated climate over various subregions, compared with the GCM and observations. With this purpose, a representative set of variables was analyzed and statistically compared. Overall, the fields simulated by the <b>nesting</b> <b>system</b> provide a better representation of the South American climate than the GCM. In particular, significant improvements are found in the nested model climatology for near-surface temperature and mean sea level pressure. Comparison of the January and July simulations shows a better wintertime performance. Some significant summertime features, like the Bolivian High, are reasonably well simulated by DARLAM, but not by the GCM. Copyright 2002 by the American Geophysical Union. Fil:Nicolini, M.

40|$|International audienceA variable-grid {{atmospheric}} {{general circulation}} model, LMDZ, {{with a local}} zoom over southeast China is used to investigate regional climate changes {{in terms of both}} means and extremes. Two time slices of 30 years are chosen to represent, respectively, the end of the 20 th century and the middle of the 21 st century. The lower-boundary conditions (sea-surface temperature and sea-ice extension) are taken from the outputs of three global coupled climate models: Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM) and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). Results from a two-way <b>nesting</b> <b>system</b> between LMDZ-global and LMDZ-regional are also presented. The evaluation of simulated temperature and precipitation for the current climate shows that LMDZ reproduces generally well the spatial distribution of mean climate and extreme climate events in southeast China, but the model has systematic cold biases in temperature and tends to overestimate the extreme precipitation. The two-way nesting model can reduce the "cold bias" to some extent compared to the one-way nesting model. Results with greenhouse gas forcing from the SRES-A 2 emission scenario show that there is a significant increase for mean, daily-maximum and minimum temperature in the entire region, associated with a {{decrease in the number of}} frost days and an increase in the heat wave duration. The annual frost days are projected to significantly decrease by 12 - 19 days while the heat wave duration to increase by about 7 days. A warming environment gives rise to changes in extreme precipitation events. Except two simulations (LMDZ/GFDL and LMDZ/IPSL 2) that project a decrease in maximum 5 -day precipitation (R 5 d) for winter, other precipitation extremes are projected to increase over most of southeast China in all seasons, and among the three global scenarios. The domain-averaged values for annual simple daily intensity index (SDII), R 5 d and fraction of total rainfall from extreme events (R 95 t) are projected to increase by 6 - 7, 10 - 13 and 11 - 14 %, respectively, relative to their present-day values. However, it is clear that more research will be needed to assess the uncertainties on the projection in future of climate extremes at local scale. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Botany and Zoology)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2009. Females of many {{bird species}} prefer {{to mate with}} males exhibiting {{elaborate}} ornamentation, which serves {{as an indicator of}} male quality. Such ornaments, called secondary sexual traits, could act as signals to females that males could confer direct and/or indirect genetic benefits (when offspring inherit superior genes), on offspring. In particular, {{it has been suggested that}} these signals relate to male ability to resist infections, as only high quality individuals are able to invest both in high immune defence and elaborate ornament expression. The ostrich (Struthio camelus) is the largest living bird and is a member of the family of flightless birds, the ratites. They are sexually dimorphic, males displaying black plumage, and a pink-coloured neck and bill; whereas females display dull-brown plumage (both sexes have white feathers). Little is known about the mating system of ostriches: they are promiscuous and in the wild, males and females have multiple partners. The communal <b>nesting</b> <b>system</b> of ostriches is unique in that only the major female and major male provide parental care, in the form of incubation and guarding the offspring until independence. Furthermore, a remarkable feature of cohorts is that offspring may differ greatly in size, and these size differences are likely to have a genetic basis arising from differing parental genotypic differences. As a trade-off between immune response and life-history traits has been documented in various bird species, I examined the relationships between male secondary sexual traits (and specifically colouration) and maternal investment; levels of immunocompetence in both parents and chicks; and chick growth. This study showed that females invest more at the egg stage in response to traits involved in the male courtship display: the colour of the neck, white and black body feathers, and the brightness of black feathers. As these traits, which are exposed during the courtship display as well as during male-male interactions, were related to male immune responses, I suggest that only high quality males will be able to display their condition optimally. Chicks with higher growth rates were found to have intermediate responses to stimulation of their humoral immune system with diphtheria and tetanus vaccines, suggesting that not only fitness benefits, but also costs are associated with mounting an immune response; and that variation in humoral responses and growth rates relates to how individuals trade off these costs and benefits. In addition, chick humoral responses were found to be related to the humoral response of both parents, but through different antibody responses (maternal responses to tetanus and paternal responses to diphtheria), suggesting that this component of the immune system is heritable. As the colouration of white feathers predicted chick growth rates, as well as a male’s ability to raise an antibody response, I suggest that this visual cue could serve as a signal to females of male humoral immunocompetence, therefore forming the basis of mate choice whereby females could increase the fitness of their offspring through higher growth rates...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Within the {{framework}} of Witsenhausen’s intrinsic model for discrete stochastic control, we provide a unified framework to extend and study three binary relations between agents: the so called precedence, subsystem and memory-communication relations. These are tools to analyze nonsequential systems, those for which, in contrast to sequential ones, any a priori ordering of control actions is impossible independently of the set of control laws. We give localized versions of these relations are given; localizing the precedence relation provides an evocative characterization of Witsenhausen’s causality property (C). Connections between these three binary relations are exhibited. We show in particular that the subsystem relation is the reflexive and transitive closure of the precedence relation. We give new characterizations of sequentiality, and introduce systems closed under precedence, as well as partially <b>nested</b> <b>systems.</b> We prove that partially <b>nested</b> <b>systems</b> without self information (causal ones in particular) are sequential.
