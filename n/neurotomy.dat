40|$|Abstract Background Cervicogenic {{headache}} (CEH) is {{a unilateral}} headache localised {{in the neck}} or occipital region, projecting to the frontal and temporal regions. Since the pathogenesis of this syndrome appears to have an anatomical basis in the cervical region, several surgical procedures aimed at reducing the nociceptive input on the cervical level, have been tested. We developed a sequence of various cervical radiofrequency <b>neurotomies</b> (facet joint denervations eventually followed by upper dorsal root ganglion <b>neurotomies)</b> that proved successful in a prospective pilot trial with 15 CEH patients. To further evaluate this sequential treatment program we conducted a randomised controlled trial Methods 30 patients with cervicogenic headache according to the Sjaastad diagnostic criteria, were randomised. 15 patients received a sequence of radiofrequency treatments (cervical facet joint denervation, followed by cervical dorsal root ganglion lesions when necessary), and the other 15 patients underwent local injections with steroid and anaesthetic at the greater occipital nerve, followed by {{transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation}} (TENS) when necessary. Visual analogue scores for pain, global perceived effects scores, quality of life scores were assessed at 8, 16, 24 and 48 weeks. Patients also kept a headache diary. Results There were no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} treatment groups at any time point in the trial. Conclusion We did not find evidence that radiofrequency treatment of cervical facet joints and upper dorsal root ganglions is a better treatment than the infiltration of the greater occipital nerve, followed by TENS for patients fulfilling the clinical criteria of cervicogenic headache. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cats {{trained to}} avoid a foot shock (US) when {{electrical}} stimulation (CS) was applied to homotopic areas on either the right or left marginal gyrus were subjected to various degrees of surgical isolation of the stimulated areas. For ten cats a U-shaped incision on one hemisphere isolated the stimulated area {{from most of the}} intracortical connections, and the contralateral area was undercut to eliminate direct corticifugal conduction. Postoperative tests showed a highly significant superiority in conditioned reflex (CR) level for stimulation of U-cut cortex. Cats with cortex undercut had to be retrained before a stable level of CR could be reestablished. Four other animals underwent bilateral undercutting of varying extents so that the reorganization cound be more carefully evaluated. Trigeminal <b>neurotomies</b> and other controls were utilized. It is concluded that the electrically applied CS normally is elaborated principally via corticifugal fibers and if these fibers are cut, additional training is necessary before the intracortically conducted CS can become effective...|$|R
5000|$|The terms rhizotomy and <b>neurotomy</b> {{are also}} {{increasingly}} becoming interchangeable {{in the treatment}} of chronic back pain from degenerative disc disease. This is a procedure called a facet rhizotomy and is not a surgical procedure but is instead done on an outpatient basis using a simple probe to apply radiofrequency waves to the impinged pain-causing nerve root lying between the facet joint and the vertebral body. Such radio frequency nerve lesioning results in five to eight or more months of pain relief before the nerve regenerates and another round of the procedure needs to be performed. A facet rhizotomy {{is just one of many}} different forms of radiofrequency ablation, and its use of the [...] "rhizotomy" [...] name should not be confused with the SDR procedure.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To objectively {{assess the}} {{decrease}} in spasticity and the improvement in gait after tibial nerve <b>neurotomy</b> performed to treat spastic equinovarus foot. DESIGN: Before-after trial with a 2 -yr follow-up. Three hemiplegic patients with spastic equinovarus foot were treated with a selective peripheral <b>neurotomy</b> of the tibial motor nerve branches (soleus, lateral and medial gastrocnemius and tibialis posterior nerves). Evaluation included clinical assessment of spasticity (Ashworth scale), maximal Hoffmann reflex (H(max)) /compound muscle action potential (M(max)) ratio measurement, gait analysis, and muscle stiffness evaluation performed before and 2 mos, 1 yr, and 2 yrs after the <b>neurotomy.</b> RESULTS: Spasticity, muscle stiffness, and H(max) /M(max) ratio decreased after <b>neurotomy.</b> The kinematic (ankle dorsal flexion and knee recurvatum) and kinetic variables (maximum ankle muscle moment and external work) of the gait were permanently improved after <b>neurotomy.</b> Interestingly, kinetic variables seemed to gradually improve with time after the <b>neurotomy.</b> CONCLUSION: Tibial <b>neurotomy</b> is an effective and durable treatment for spastic equinovarus foot...|$|E
40|$|Spasticity {{is usually}} treated by rehabilitation, orthosis, {{chemical}} denervations, orthopaedic surgery and neurosurgery. Selective fascicular <b>neurotomy</b> is a neurosurgical procedure consisting in partial section of selected motor nerves innervating spastic muscles. <b>Neurotomy</b> is indicated {{in cases of}} localised disabling spasticity without musculotendinous shortening, resistant to chemical denervation and for which a motor nerve block with anaesthetic has given a good functional result. <b>Neurotomy</b> includes division of the afferent Ia and Ib fibers, unable to recover, leading to permanent disappearance of the spasticity. <b>Neurotomy</b> also includes section of the motor efferent fibers with transient paresis as a result. In adults, <b>neurotomy</b> provides functional improvement in 81 to 97 % of cases. In case of posterior tibial <b>neurotomy,</b> improved walking stability {{and a decrease in}} foot equinus and knee recurvatum is observed.

40|$|There are {{currently}} no initial guides for {{the diagnosis of}} somatic referred pain of lumbar zygapophyseal joint (LZJ) or sacroiliac joint (SIJ). We developed a classification system of LZJ and SIJ pain, the "pain distribution pattern template (PDPT) " depending on the pain distribution patterns {{from a pool of}} 200 patients whose spinal pain source was confirmed. We prospectively applied the PDPT to determine its contribution to clinical decision-making for 419 patients whose pain was presumed to arise from the LZJs (259 patients) or SIJs (160 patients). Forty-nine percent (128 / 259) of LZJ and 46 % (74 / 160) of SIJ arthopathies diagnosed by PDPT were confirmed by nerve blocks. Diagnostic reliabilities were significantly higher in Type A and C patterns in LZJ and Type C in SIJ arthropathies, 64 %, 80 %, and 68. 4 %, respectively. For both LZJ and SIJ arthropathies, favorable outcome after radiofrequency (RF) <b>neurotomies</b> was similar to the rate of positive responses to diagnostic blocks in Type A to Type D, whereas the outcome was unpredictable in those with undetermined type (Type E). Considering the paucity of currently available diagnostic methods for LZJ and SIJ arthropathies, PDPT is useful in clinical decision-making as well as in predicting the treatment outcome...|$|R

This study aimed at analyse neuro-orthopaedics procedures performed in such indications, considering their timing, their main functional objectives and their global efficacy on gait and walking conditions. MethodsOne hundred sixty-one adult patients were assessed at the spasticity multidisciplinary consultation of Lille University hospital and then operated on in 2012 and 2013. Data were analysed retrospectively and included disease history, main functional objectives, nature of surgical procedures and their timing of realization and finally a qualitative analysis of analytic and functional results at the end of the treatment (with a one year post-surgery period). ResultsPatients presented with consequences of stroke (57. 8 %), traumatic brain injury (11. 8 %), cerebral palsy (9. 3 %); median post-lesion period was 3. 5 years. The objective for patients was an improvement of gait (94. 4 %) and transfer (7, 5 %), and a reduction in walking aids (6. 8 %). Ninety-six patients (59. 6 %) were operated on twice; in this case, the first surgical phase consisted most of time in <b>neurotomies,</b> the second one in tendinous and articular procedures. At the end of the treatment, goals were totally reached in 2 / 3 of patients and at least in part in 30 % of them. Kinematic abnormalities during gait (equinus, varus, valgus, toe claws) were clearly improved. Finally, the need of assistance when walking or making transfers and the need for orthotics were significantly reduced. DiscussionThis study confirms the efficacy of neuro-orthopaedic treatment of distal lower limb spastic deformities on gait and walking conditions. Efficacy on activities, participation and quality of life remains to be studied...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionSelective {{peripheral}} <b>neurotomies</b> (SPN) {{are proposed}} when spasticity is focalized on muscles {{that are under}} the control of a single or few peripheral nerves. ObjectiveThis study was done to evaluate the functional results of SPN of median and ulnar nerves in 10 patients who had spastic hyperflexion of the wrist and fingers. MethodsAll patients preoperatively had spasticity either G 3 or G 4 as measured by modified Ashworth scale. All cases underwent surgery in the form of variable combination of SPN of median and ulnar nerves depending on the pattern and distribution of spasticity. Depending on the degree of preoperative spasticity, 50 – 80 % of the isolated motor branches of fascicles were resected under the operating microscope. Mean postoperative follow up examination period was 21 months. ResultsThere was no operative mortality. One patient had wound infection. Transient paresis of flexors of the wrist and fingers because of excessive nerves sectioning occurred in one patient that responded well to physiotherapy. Postoperatively, all the patients had immediate improvement of their spasticity grade. After initial improvement, recurrence of spasticity occurred in one patient 6 months postoperatively and that might be due to insufficient amount of nerve sectioning. Abnormal hand posture that was present in all cases improved in 9 patients (90 %) postoperatively, while pain that was present in 50 % of cases improved in all these cases postoperatively as measured by visual analogue scale. Assessment of outcome after surgery was done by comparing modified Ashworth scale preoperatively and postoperatively. At the last follow up examination period, excellent results were obtained in 40 % of patients, good results in 40 % of patients, fair results in 10 % of patients, and poor results in 10 % of cases. Conclusion: In well-selected patients, SPN can yield good effects on refractory spasticity of the hand and its consequences...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess and}} compare, {{clinically}} and electrophysiologically, {{the effects on}} muscle innervation and spasticity of selective anaesthetic nerve block and selective <b>neurotomy</b> of the motor-nerve branch to the soleus muscle in patients with spastic equinus foot. METHODS: Eleven hemiplegic patients were studied before and after anaesthetic tibial-nerve block, and at two months and one year after tibial nerve <b>neurotomy.</b> Triceps surae spasticity and strength, walking speed, gait kinematics of the ankle, maximal amplitude of the H reflex and of the M-response and the Hmax/Mmax ratio of the soleus muscle, and the mean motor unit action potential area and motor unit number estimation (MUNE) of the soleus muscle were calculated on the normal and spastic side. RESULTS: Spasticity and equinovarus improved {{in a similar fashion}} after tibial nerve block and <b>neurotomy.</b> The soleus Hmax/Mmax ratio decreased by 42 % after tibial nerve block and 77 % after <b>neurotomy.</b> The soleus MUNE decreased by 52 % after tibial nerve block and by 86 % after <b>neurotomy.</b> CONCLUSION: Diagnostic nerve block predicts the spasticity and gait improvement, which is expected after <b>neurotomy.</b> The clinical improvement was similar after block and <b>neurotomy.</b> Nerve block is associated with a 50 % decrease in the soleus Hmax/Mmax ratio and soleus MUNE.

40|$|Background: Cervical facet block (FB) {{procedures}} {{are often used}} as a diagnostic precursor to radiofrequency <b>neurotomies</b> (RFN) {{in the management of}} chronic whiplash associated disorders (WAD). Some individuals will respond to the FB procedures and others will not respond. Such responders and non-responders provided a sample of convenience to question whether there were differences in their physical and psychological features. This information may inform future predictive studies and ultimately the clinical selection of patients for FB procedures. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 58 individuals with chronic WAD who responded to cervical FB procedures (WAD_R); 32 who did not respond (WAD_NR) and 30 Healthy Controls (HC) s. Measures included: quantitative sensory tests (pressure; thermal pain thresholds; brachial plexus provocation test); nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR); motor function (cervical range of movement (ROM); activity of the superficial neck flexors during the cranio-cervical flexion test (CCFT). Self-reported measures were gained from the following questionnaires: neuropathic pain (s-LANSS); psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire- 28), post-traumatic stress (PDS) and pain catastrophization (PCS). Individuals with chronic whiplash attended the laboratory once the effects of the blocks had abated and symptoms had returned. Results: Following FB procedures, both WAD groups demonstrated generalized hypersensitivity to all sensory tests, decreased neck ROM and increased superficial muscle activity with the CCFT compared to controls (p 0. 05). Both WAD groups demonstrated psychological distress (GHQ- 28; p < 0. 05), moderate post-traumatic stress symptoms and pain catastrophization. The WAD_NR group also demonstrated increased medication intake and elevated PCS scores compared to the WAD_R group (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Chronic WAD responders and non-responders to FB procedures demonstrate a similar presentation of sensory disturbance, motor dysfunction and psychological distress. Higher levels of pain catastrophization and greater medication intake were the only factors found to differentiate these groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND:. Selective <b>neurotomy</b> is a {{permanent}} treatment of focal spasticity, and its effectiveness in treating spastic equinovarus of the foot (SEF) was previously suggested by a few nonrandomized and uncontrolled case-series studies. OBJECTIVES:. This study is the first assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled trial evaluating {{the effects of this}} treatment. METHODS:. Sixteen chronic stroke patients presenting with SEF were randomized into 2 groups: 8 patients underwent a tibial <b>neurotomy</b> and the remaining 8 received botulinum toxin (BTX) injections. The soleus was treated in all patients, and the tibialis posterior and flexor hallucis longus were treated in about half of patients. The primary outcome was the quantitative measurement of ankle stiffness (L-path), an objective measurement directly related to spasticity. Participants were assessed by a blind assessor before their intervention and at 2 and 6 months after treatment. Evaluations were based on the 3 domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). RESULTS:. Compared with BTX, tibial <b>neurotomy</b> induced a higher reduction in ankle stiffness. Both treatments induced a comparable improvement of ankle kinematics during gait, whereas neither induced muscle weakening. Activity, participation, and quality of life were not significantly modified in either group. CONCLUSIONS:. This study demonstrates that the tibial nerve <b>neurotomy</b> is an effective treatment of SEF, reducing the impairments observed in chronic stroke patients. Future studies should be conducted to confirm the long-term efficacy based on the ICF domains...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study aims to {{determine}} if cervical medial branch radiofrequency <b>neurotomy</b> reduces psychophysical indicators of augmented central pain processing and improves motor function in individuals with chronic whiplash symptoms. Design. Prospective observational study of consecutive patients with healthy control comparison. Setting. Tertiary spinal intervention centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Subjects. Fifty-three individuals with chronic whiplash associated disorder symptoms (Grade 2); 30 healthy controls. Methods. Measures were made at four time points: two prior to radiofrequency <b>neurotomy,</b> and 1 - and 3 -months post-radiofrequency <b>neurotomy.</b> Measures included: comprehensive quantitative sensory testing (including brachial plexus provocation test), nociceptive flexion reflex, and motor function (cervical range of movement, superficial neck flexor activity during the craniocervical flexion test). Self-report pain and disability measures were also collected. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance and Friedman's tests were performed to investigate the effect {{of time on the}} earlier measures. Differences between the whiplash and healthy control groups were investigated with two-tailed independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney tests. Results. Following cervical radiofrequency <b>neurotomy,</b> there were significant early (within 1 month) and sustained (3 months) improvements in pain, disability, local and widespread hyperalgesia to pressure and thermal stimuli, nociceptive flexor reflex threshold, and brachial plexus provocation test responses as well as increased neck range of motion (all P 0. 13) was measured. Conclusions. Attenuation of psychophysical measures of augmented central pain processing and improved cervical movement imply that these processes are maintained by peripheral nociceptive input.

40|$|In {{an outcome}} study, Dreyfuss et al {{demonstrated}} {{how good the}} outcomes could be from lumbar medial branch <b>neurotomy.</b> Yet that study was variously chastised: for having no controls; for being highly selective in its recruitment criteria; for enrolling only a tiny proportion of potential patients; and, therefore, for being too small a study. Subsequently, systematic reviews demanded randomized controlled trials of lumbar medial branch <b>neurotomy,</b> {{but none of the}} controlled trials that followed used correct surgical technique for this procedure; and none selected patients on the basis of controlled diagnostic blocks. Dr. Nath answered the call for studies. His is the first study, since Dreyfuss et al, to use controlled diagnostic blocks to select patients, and the first to use correct technique. But Dr. Nath did something unusual. He did not select ideal patients, free of comorbidity, with already good function, and no depression. He drew his patients from a pain clinic population. His patients had other problems; but they were, nevertheless, able to identify a component of their pain that was completely relieved by controlled medial branch blocks. It was this pain that Dr. Nath treated in a placebo-controlled trial of lumbar medial branch <b>neurotomy.</b> Dr. Nath should be commended for his industry both in mounting and concluding a placebo-controlled trial. His results clearly show that the effects of lumbar medial branch <b>neurotomy</b> cannot be attributed, ex cathedra, to placebo effects. The effects are genuine...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of radial optic <b>neurotomy</b> and retinal endovascular surgery on retinal blood flow velocity in patients with central retinal vein occlusion. METHODS: A prospective interventional case series. RESULTS: Six patients with a central retinal vein occlusion of < 12 months' duration were included. Three patients were treated with radial optic <b>neurotomy</b> and three with retinal endovascular surgery. Five patients had decreased central venous blood flow velocity compared with the fellow eye, and one patient had similar central venous blood flow in both eyes at baseline. All study eyes had decreased central venous blood flow velocity compared with the fellow eye at 24 weeks after treatment. Two patients had a further decrease in central venous blood flow during the study. Three patients had no minimal change in central venous blood flow, and 1 patient showed a minimal increase from 3 cm/s at baseline to 4 cm/s 24 weeks after surgery. CONCLUSION: Radial optic <b>neurotomy</b> and retinal endovascular surgery do not alter central retinal blood flow velocity. The place of these therapies in the treatment for central retinal vein occlusion should be questioned...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesFour studies {{assessing}} vestibular compensation in Menière's disease patients undergoing unilateral vestibular <b>neurotomy,</b> {{using different}} analysis methods, are reviewed, {{with a focus}} on the different strategies used by patients according to their preoperative sensory preference. Material and methodsFour prospective studies performed in a university tertiary referral center were reviewed, measuring the pattern of vestibular compensation in Menière's disease patients before and after unilateral vestibular <b>neurotomy</b> on various assessment protocols: postural syndrome assessed on static posturography and gait analysis; perceptual syndrome assessed on subjective visual vertical perception; and oculomotor syndrome assessed on ocular cyclotorsion. ResultsVestibular compensation occurred at variable intervals depending on the parameter investigated. Open-eye postural control and gait/walking returned to normal one month after <b>neurotomy.</b> Fine balance analysis found that visual perception of the vertical and ocular cyclotorsion impairment persisted at long-term follow-up. Clinical postural disturbance persisted only when visual afferents were cut off (eyes closed). These impairments were the expression of a postoperative change in postural strategy related to the new use of visual and non-visual references. ConclusionsUnderstanding pre-operative interindividual variation in balance strategy is critical to screening for postural instability and tailoring vestibular rehabilitation...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} a revised technique of percutaneous radiofrequency <b>neurotomy</b> for third occipital headache. Methods: The revisions included using a large gauge electrode, ensuring minimum separation between the three electrode placements, and holding the electrode in place by hand. The revised technique was used to treat 51 nerves in 49 patients diagnosed as suffering from third occipital headache {{on the basis of}} controlled diagnostic blocks of the third occipital nerve. The criteria for successful outcome were complete relief of pain for at least 90 days associated with restoration of normal activities of daily living, and no use of drug treatment for the headache. Results: Of the 49 patients, 43 (88 %) achieved a successful outcome. The median duration of relief in these patients was 297 days, with eight patients continuing to have ongoing relief. Fourteen patients underwent a repeat <b>neurotomy</b> to reinstate relief, with 12 (86 %) achieving a successful outcome. The median duration of relief in these patients was 217 days, with six patients having ongoing relief. Side effects of the procedure were consistent with coagulation of the third occipital nerve and consisted of slight ataxia, numbness, and temporary dysaesthesia. No side effects required intervention, and they were tolerated by the patients in exchange for the relief of headache. Conclusions: Use of the revised procedure greatly improved the rather low success rate previously encountered with third occipital <b>neurotomy.</b> Although the relief of headache is limited in duration, it is profound and can be reinstated by repeat <b>neurotomy.</b> No other form of treatment has been validated for this common form of headache...|$|E
