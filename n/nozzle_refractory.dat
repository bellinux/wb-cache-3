40|$|The {{interest}} of gaining on-line {{information related to}} non-metallic inclusions during the steelmaking process has recently increased due to the development {{as well as the}} promising results of the Pulse Distribution Analysis with Optical Emission Spectroscopy method (PDA/OES). Even though, the time from sampling to presented results on inclusions is only about 5 - 10 minutes, the method has also shown limitations with respect to the determination of some inclusion characteristics. Therefore, a first step was to perform a study on other methods such as the cross-section method (CS) on a polished sample surface, the cross-section after etching method (CSE), the bromine-methanol extraction method (BME), and the electrolytic extraction method (EE). This study focused on the evaluation of these methods with respect to the time consumption for preparation and analysis of a sample, the analyzed volume and the determination of inclusion and cluster characteristics such as size, number, particle size distribution (PSD) and composition. The CS and CSE methods were found to be suitable in the determination of the largest cluster in a sample which can be recommended in order to select proper extraction parameters for further studies. The BME method was considered to be fast with the possibility of analyzing a large volume. However, the used solution is chemically stronger compared to electrolytic extraction solutions, which can affect the results. In most aspects, the EE method was found to be the most stable, reliable and accurate method with some limitations regarding the time aspect. Based on this conclusion, the EE method was selected for a comparative study with the PDA/OES method. Reliably detected size ranges by using the PDA/OES method were defined for two low-alloyed steel grades. These are 2. 0 - 5. 7 μm and 1. 4 - 5. 7 μm for steel samples taken before and after a Ca-addition during the secondary steelmaking, respectively. Moreover, agreements between the EE and PDA/OES methods were observed in the average size and number of detected inclusions when only inclusions with the size > 2 μm were considered. Also, a theoretical minimum size and a maximum number ofinclusions present in the steel sample, which can be detected by using the PDA/OES method, were estimated. The work continued by successfully applying the EE method to study correlations between inclusions observed in the liquid steel samples and in a clogged nozzle (clogging material). It was found that the average sizes of spherical and non-spherical inclusions observed in the steel corresponded well with those observed in the clogging material. However, there were some differences in the frequencies of these inclusions. This was explained by a possible transformation of the present inclusions due to a reoxidation and a reaction with the <b>nozzle</b> <b>refractory</b> of the steel melt. The results of this study may contribute in the selection of proper process parameters or inclusion characteristics for future studies on the improvement and application of on-line methods. Finally, suggestions on how to present and interpret data obtained by the PDA/OES method during production of stainless steels were given in the present thesis. More specifically, the possibilities of defining operating windows with respect to inclusion composition and the use of a B-factor for Al (the total content of Al in inclusions detected by using the PDA/OES method) during the secondary steelmaking were discussed. In addition, a correlation study between B-factors for Al and numbers of inclusions (dV > 4 μm) obtained by using the PDA/OES method on process samples, and corresponding slivers indices from plate products was performed. The results showed a moderate correlation between these parameters as well as an increase of the slivers index with increased values of the chosen PDA/OES data. This indicates that it could be possible to predict when there is an increased risk of having slivers on the final rolled product at an early stage of the steelmaking process. QC 20150525 </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{walls of}} <b>nozzle</b> <b>refractories</b> in {{steelmaking}} processes can clog or erode, {{depending on their}} composition relative to the inclusions in the steel. Both problems can lead to severe inclusion problems in the cast product. Fundamental computational models are developed to study the complex coupled phenomena which govern this process: the turbulent flow of molten steel through the nozzle, contacting of solid inclusions in the steel with the nozzle wall, heat transfer in the wall and steel, species diffusion through the nozzle wall, and the thermodynamics of the chemical reactions that form solid precipitates, or change {{the composition of the}} inclusions to liquefy them, allowing them to erode from the walls. A case study is simulated in this work for clogging prevention in CaO-bearing nozzles by partial liquefying of the Al 2 O 3 inclusions. The model is validated with measurements of erosion rate and composition variations in the wall. Such models offer potential for new quantitative insights into these phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The {{convoluted}} nozzle is {{a conventional}} <b>refractory</b> metal <b>nozzle</b> extension that is formed with {{a portion of}} the nozzle convoluted to show the extendible nozzle within the length of the rocket engine. The convoluted nozzle (CN) was deployed by a system of four gas driven actuators. For spacecraft applications the optimum CN may be self-deployed by internal pressure retained, during deployment, by a jettisonable exit closure. The convoluted nozzle is included in a study of extendible nozzles for the RL 10 Engine Derivative 2 B for use in an early orbit transfer vehicle (OTV).

30|$|Ceramic {{material}} has high hardness, high wear resistance, and good high temperature stability, {{as well as}} good electrical and thermal conductivity and chemical resistance [1]. Therefore, {{there is a great}} prospect in the field of <b>refractories,</b> <b>nozzles,</b> cutting tools, and bearings. In addition, ceramic material belongs to the boron-containing series ceramics and can generate boron oxide lubricating film dissolved with other elements under friction and high temperature (800 – 1000  °C) driving, which can realize self-lubricating and is a very good self-lubricating material [2]. Ceramic {{material has}} good neutron control capabilities and can be used in the nuclear industry. However, the sintering densification of ceramic materials is more difficult in bending strength, and the defects of low fracture toughness limit its application scope. It often fails because of damage [3]. Related studies have shown that [4] (W,Ti)C composites can effectively increase the bending strength and fracture toughness of composite ceramic materials. With the increasing demand for composite materials in modern engineering, during the preparation of composite ceramic materials, if the formulation is not optimized, ceramic material grain growth and abnormal growth may occur during the preparation process. (W,Ti)C grain distribution is not uniform and will not achieve the purpose of improving the performance of composite ceramic materials. Therefore, optimizing the proportion of the two components in composite ceramic materials is very important to improve the performance of composite ceramic materials. In addition, adding (W,Ti)C composites to ceramic material can also significantly improve its mechanical properties. The level of mechanical properties of [5] is closely related to the microstructure. But the mechanical properties are closely related to the microstructure. The grain growth during sintering determines the evolution of the microstructure and the local topological structure of the sintered body, and the bending strength of the sintered body. Fracture toughness and hardness play an important role. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the grain growth in the sintering process of ceramic materials and optimize the sintering process to improve the bending strength, fracture toughness, and hardness of the materials.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the need of {{metallurgical}} industry in the world, a new MgAlON-BN composite which can be used for example in special <b>refractory</b> <b>nozzles,</b> tubes and break rings for the continuous casting of steel was studied in the present thesis. The aim was to understand the mechanism of synthesis and their physicochemical properties during the application. Thus, the thermodynamic properties, synthesis process, mechanical properties, thermal shock behaviour, thermal diffusivity/conductivity as well as corrosion resistance to molten iron containing oxygen and molten slag of MgAlON and MgAlON-BN composites have been investigated. The Gibbs energy of formation of MgAlON was estimated using the method proposed by Kaufman. The phase stability diagram of Mg-Al-O-N-B was investigated, and consequently the synthesis parameters were determined. MgAlON and MgAlON-BN composites were fabricated by hot-pressing method. The composites obtained this way were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and HREM analyses. A Matrix-flushing method was employed in the quantitative XRD analysis for the multi-component samples to understand the mechanism of synthesis. The relationship between mechanical properties and microstructure of the composites was investigated. The experimental results indicated that BN addition has significant influence on the mechanical properties of the composites. These {{can be explained by the}} fact that BN has low Young’s modulus, density and non-reactive nature as well as considerable anisotropy of many properties such as thermal expansion, thermal diffusivity/conductivity. Thus, the addition of BN in MgAlON is likely to lead to the presence of microcracks caused by the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficient. The microcracks result in the enhancement of the strength at elevated temperature and thermal shock durability of the composites. Effective thermal conductivities were evaluated from the present experimental results of thermal diffusivities, heat capacity and density. A model suitable for present composites has been derived based on Luo’s model. The predicted lines calculated by the model were in good agreement with experimental results. The reactions between the composites and molten iron as well as the slag were investigated by ‘‘finger’’ experiments and sessile drop experiments. Both experimental results indicated that the BN addition has positive influence on the corrosion resistance. These are attributed to the excellent corrosion resistance of BN to molten iron and slag, such as the higher contact angle between BN substrate and liquid iron and molten slag compared with that obtained for pure MgAlON.
