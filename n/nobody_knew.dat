5|$|During the 1970s, Walter Alvarez {{was doing}} {{geologic}} research in central Italy. There he had located an outcrop {{on the walls}} of a gorge whose limestone layers included strata both above and below the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Exactly at the boundary is a thin layer of clay. Walter told his father that the layer marked where the dinosaurs and much else became extinct and that <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> why, or what the clay was about — it was a big mystery and he intended to solve it.|$|E

25|$|Stress {{came when}} sons, husbands, fathers, brothers, and fiancés were drafted {{and sent to}} faraway {{training}} camps, preparing for a war in which <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> how many would be killed. Millions of wives tried to relocate near their husbands' training camps.|$|E
25|$|Hence, the {{counterexample}} to CLP {{had been}} known for nearly ten years, {{it is just that}} <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> why it worked! All the results prior to the theorem above made use of some form of permutability of congruences. The difficulty was to find enough structure in congruence lattices of non-congruence-permutable lattices.|$|E
25|$|This greatly {{damaged the}} labourer’s {{movement}} as soon <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> which organisation they belonged to.

Corr, with the dual title Trade and Labour Association (T), as successor to Davitt’s Democratic Labour Federation.|$|E

25|$|In September 2014, it was {{reported}} that Pynchon may have a cameo in the film, which Anderson would not confirm, citing Pynchon's choice {{to stay out of the}} public spotlight.

25|$|Colby's death {{triggered}} {{conspiracy theories}} that {{his death was}} due to foul play. In his 2011 documentary The Man <b>Nobody</b> <b>Knew,</b> Colby's son Carl suggested that his father suffered from guilt due to his actions in the CIA and committed suicide. Carl's step-mother and siblings, as well as Colby's biographer Randall Woods, criticized Carl's portrayal of William Colby, and rejected the allegation that the former CIA director killed himself as inconsistent with his character.|$|E
25|$|At this point, <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> {{how long}} Hearne could keep going. However, 1899 saw unmistakable signs of decline, for apart from {{early in the}} season on very helpful pitches, Hearne lost most of his sting. Despite a hat-trick in the first ever Test at Headingley that {{suggested}} he was still a great bowler, Hearne's haul of wickets declined from 222 to 127 and his average rose by fifty percent – a great decline even when the very dry weather after the first few games is considered.|$|E

25|$|The {{most radical}} {{innovation}} of 1976 was the 6-wheeled Tyrrell P34. The P34 {{was a good}} car, often finishing third or fourth and winning the Swedish Grand Prix, {{but it was not}} superior to the best 4-wheeled cars. 1976 also saw the Lotus team fitting brushes or plastic skirts under its rather uncompetitive 77; McLaren and Brabham also experimented with air-dams and splitters in an attempt to cause low-pressure areas under the car but found no significant effect on performance, in fact <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> what was in Chapman's mind.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{among the}} {{non-native}} scholars living in Yi Province, {{there was one}} Hu Qian (胡潛), whose courtesy name was Gongxing (公興). <b>Nobody</b> <b>knew</b> why he left his home in Wei Commandery (魏郡; around present-day Handan, Hebei) and travelled {{all the way to}} Yi Province. While Hu Qian was not as well-read and knowledgeable as the others, he was intelligent and had a very good memory. He memorised and knew by heart everything about Confucian rites, rituals, procedures, protocol, etc., ranging from ancestral worship to the five types of mourning attire.|$|E
25|$|Arthur's post-retirement work {{in theater}} was intermittent, {{somewhat}} curtailed by her unease and discomfort about working in public. Capra claimed she vomited in her dressing room between scenes, yet emerged each time {{to perform a}} flawless take. According to John Oller's biography, Jean Arthur: The Actress <b>Nobody</b> <b>Knew</b> (1997), Arthur developed a kind of stage fright punctuated with bouts of psychosomatic illnesses. A prime example was in 1945, when she was cast in {{the lead of the}} Garson Kanin play, Born Yesterday. Her nerves and insecurity got the better of her and she left the production before it reached Broadway, opening the door for a then-unknown Judy Holliday to take the part.|$|E

25|$|In 1967 the World Health Organization (WHO) {{decided that}} the HLA {{research}} needed an official naming system. This in turn would aid in organization and would more easily facilitate the unification of data being collected at numerous laboratories across the world. This committee is still in existence today and vastly accelerated the rate of HLA research. The first meeting of this committee in 1968 set forth guidelines and rules that govern HLAs. First, compatibility genes {{were divided into two}} types, class I and class II. Class I molecules were identified via reactions between blood serum and cells. Class II molecules were identified by mixtures of white blood cells. Second, the compatibility genes were renamed Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). Despite this clarification and the ever-increasing number of identified HLAs, <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> how they worked.|$|E

500|$|During 1916 and 1917 {{there had}} been a major {{epidemic}} in the US; 27,000cases and 6,000deaths were recorded, with 9,000cases in New York City. At the time <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> how the virus was spreading. Many of the city's inhabitants, including scientists, thought that impoverished slum-dwelling immigrants were to blame even though the prevalence of the disease was higher in the more prosperous districts such as Staten Island– a pattern that had also been seen in [...] cities like Philadelphia. Many other industrialised countries were affected at the same time. In particular, before the outbreaks in the US, large epidemics had occurred in Sweden.|$|E
500|$|On [...] April 18–20, 1946, Teller {{participated in}} a conference at Los Alamos to review the wartime work on the Super. The {{properties}} of thermonuclear fuels such as deuterium and the possible design of a hydrogen bomb were discussed. It was concluded that Teller's assessment of a hydrogen bomb had been too favourable, and that both the quantity of deuterium needed, {{as well as the}} radiation losses during deuterium burning, would shed doubt on its workability. Addition of expensive tritium to the thermonuclear mixture would likely lower its ignition temperature, but even so, <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> at that time how much tritium would be needed, and whether even tritium addition would encourage heat propagation.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1981, Lynott began work on his second solo album, using Thin Lizzy members among {{a large group of}} backing musicians. Around the same time, the band were recording material for the next Thin Lizzy album, and as before, the sessions seemed to merge to the extent that musicians were not always sure which album they were working on. Producer for the Thin Lizzy sessions, Chris Tsangarides, stated, [...] "The feeling of confusion was in the air in that sometimes <b>nobody</b> <b>knew</b> if they were working on a Phil solo record or a Lizzy album." [...] Snowy White had previously felt that, as a member of Thin Lizzy, he should have been paid as a session player to appear on Lynott's solo recordings.|$|E
