It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease.

50|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, a nucleon {{is either a}} proton or a neutron, considered in {{its role as a}} component of an atomic nucleus. The number of nucleons in a nucleus defines an isotope's mass number (<b>nucleon</b> <b>number).</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{mass number}} (symbol A), also called atomic mass number or <b>nucleon</b> <b>number,</b> {{is the total}} number of protons and {{neutrons}} (together known as nucleons) in an atomic nucleus. It determines the atomic mass of atoms. Because protons and neutrons both are baryons, the mass number A is identical with the baryon number B as of the nucleus as of the whole atom or ion. The mass number is different for each different isotope of a chemical element. This {{is not the same as}} the atomic number (Z) which denotes the number of protons in a nucleus, and thus uniquely identifies an element. Hence, the difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons (N) in a given nucleus: N=A−Z.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{two-dimensional}} graphical {{representation in the}} Segrè-arrangement with the neutron number N on the abscissa and the proton number Z on the ordinate. Each nuclide is represented {{at the intersection of}} its respective neutron and proton number by a small square box with the chemical symbol and the <b>nucleon</b> <b>number</b> A. By columnar subdivision of such a field, in addition to ground states also nuclear isomers can be shown. The coloring of a field (segmented if necessary) shows in addition to the existing text entries the observed types of radioactive decay of the nuclide and a rough classification of their relative shares: stable, nonradioactive nuclides completely black, primordial radionuclides partially black, proton emission orange, alpha decay yellow, beta plus decay/electron capture red, isomeric transition (gamma decay, internal conversion) white, beta minus decay blue, spontaneous fission green, cluster emission violet, neutron emission light blue. For each radionuclide its field includes (if known) information about its half-life and essential energies of the emitted radiation, for stable nuclides and primordial radionuclides there are data on mole fraction abundances in the natural isotope mixture of the corresponding chemical element. Furthermore, for many nuclides cross sections for nuclear reactions with thermal neutrons are quoted, usually for the (n, γ)-reaction (neutron capture), partly fission cross sections for the induced nuclear fission and cross sections for the (n, α)-reaction or (n, p)-reaction. For the chemical elements cross sections and standard atomic weights (both averaged over natural isotopic composition) are specified (the relative atomic masses partially as an interval to reflect the variability of the composition of the element's natural isotope mixture). For the nuclear fission of 235U and 239Pu with thermal neutrons, percentage isobaric chain yields of fission products are listed.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{recently}} that a simple formula {{in terms of the}} valence <b>nucleon</b> <b>numbers</b> N_p and N_n, and the mass number A can describe the essential trends of excitation energies E_x (2 _ 1 ^+) of the first 2 ^+ states in even-even nuclei.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relation}} between proton and <b>nucleon</b> <b>number</b> fluctuations in the final state in relativistic heavy ion collisions. It is shown that {{the correlations between the}} isospins of nucleons in the final state are almost negligible over a wide range of collision energy. This leads to a factorization of the distribution function of the proton, neutron, and their antiparticles in the final state with binomial distribution functions. Using the factorization, we derive formulas to determine <b>nucleon</b> <b>number</b> cumulants, which are not direct experimental observables, from proton number fluctuations, which are experimentally observable in event-by-event analyses. With a simple treatment for strange baryons, the <b>nucleon</b> <b>number</b> cumulants are further promoted to the baryon number ones. Experimental determination of the baryon number cumulants makes it possible to compare various theoretical studies on them directly with experiments. Effects of nonzero isospin density on this formula are addressed quantitatively. It is shown that the effects are well suppressed over a wide energy range. Comment: 15 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematics}} of {{the atomic}} nuclei {{in the frame of}} the <b>nucleon</b> <b>number</b> A = Z + N and the proton-neutron difference F = Z - N is considered. The classification scheme is provided by means of the non-compact algebra sp(4,R). In this scheme the nuclei are ordered into isobaric multiplets, for which A=fix, as well as in F-multiplets, for which F=fix. The dependence of the mass excess Δ, the first exited states E_ 2 ^+ and the ratio R_ 2 =E_ 4 ^+/E_ 2 ^+ on the <b>nucleon</b> <b>number</b> A is empirically investigated within the F-multiplets. Appropriate filters are used to study the properties of the mass excess. Many structural effects are observed.

40|$|The binding {{system of}} a hadron and a nucleus {{is a topic}} of great {{interest}} for investigating the hadron properties. In the heavy-flavor region, the attraction between a P(=D̅,B) meson and a nucleon N can appear, where the PN-P^∗ N mixing {{plays an important role}} in relation to the heavy-quark spin symmetry. The attraction can produce exotic heavy mesic nuclei that are stable against the strong decay. We study an exotic system where the D̅ (B) meson and nucleus are bound. The meson-nucleus interaction is given by a folding potential with single-channel PN interaction and the <b>nucleon</b> <b>number</b> distribution function. By solving the Schrödinger equations of the heavy meson and the nucleus, we obtain several bound and resonant states for <b>nucleon</b> <b>number</b> A= 16, [...] ., 208.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of the {{additional}} term of the type ∼ e^- λ' N_pN_n on the recently proposed empirical formula for the lowest excitation energy of the 2 ^+ states in even-even nuclei.

We show explicitly that there is not any improvement in reproducing E_x(2 _ 1 ^+) by including the extra N_pN_n term. However, our study also reveals that the excitation energies E_x(2 _ 1 ^+), when calculated by the N_pN_n term alone (with the mass number A dependent term), are quite comparable to those calculated by the original empirical formula.
