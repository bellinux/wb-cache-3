50|$|Like other distribution-based sorts, spreadsort has the {{weakness}} that the programmer {{is required to}} provide a means of converting each element into a <b>numeric</b> <b>key,</b> {{for the purpose of}} identifying which bin it falls in. Although it is possible to do this for arbitrary-length elements such as strings by considering each element to be followed by an infinite number of minimum values, and indeed for any datatype possessing a total order, this can be more difficult to implement correctly than a simple comparison function, especially on complex structures. Poor implementation of this value function can result in clustering that harms the algorithm's relative performance.|$|E

This study provides an anatomical analysis of today's standard Chinese input process, which is based on pinyin, a phonetic spelling system in Roman characters. Through a combination of human performance modeling and experimentation, our study decomposed the Chinese input process into sub-tasks and found that choice reaction time and <b>numeric</b> <b>keying,</b> two components resulted from the large number of homophones in Chinese, were the major usability bottlenecks. Choice reaction alone took 36 % of the total input time in our experiment. <b>Numeric</b> <b>keying</b> for multiple candidates selection tends to take the user's attention away from the computer visual screen. We designed and implemented the EASE (Eye Assisted Selection and Entry) system to help maintaining complete touch-typing experience without diverting visual attention to the <b>numeric</b> <b>keys.</b> The EASE approach used a common selection key (spacebar) and implicit eye-tracking to replace the numeric keystrokes. Our experiment showed that such a system could indeed work, even with today's imperfect eyetracking technology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — To improve {{security}} of the various devices, the graphical password is memorable authentication method for authorization. But when a Personal Identification Number (PIN) entered as a numeric password in mobile or stationary systems, the Shoulder Surfing Attack (SSA) becomes great concern. To prevent SSA and to establish a secure transaction, The Multi color Technique and The Session key mechanism is proposed. In Multi color method, every <b>numeric</b> <b>key</b> is visually split into two halves and each half filled with two distinct colors simultaneously; So there exist four color groups on the numeric keypad and two colors for every <b>numeric</b> <b>key.</b> Session key mechanism constructed based on the basic layout of vertical array of digits from 0 to 9 with another array of ten familiar Symbols. This method make harder for a criminal to obtain PINs even if the iteration are fully observes the entire input of a PIN entry procedure. For Secure transaction, A One Way Hash is generated to Validated PIN and is sent to Server in public channel so that an active attacker cannot extract the PIN by monitoring the channel. Once Server Authenticated the PIN, Quick Response for the Mobile App will be redirect the user to the Services...|$|E

This paper presents a study of four candidate display styles, three commonly used in commercial products (“vertical,” “horizontal, ” and “compact-horizontal”) and one novel (“matrix”), together with various manual selection methods (mouse, <b>numeric</b> <b>key,</b> spacebar, cursor key, numeric keypad and unrestricted input method). The results show that (1) when typing a single kanji character, about 70 % of total operation time is spent on choice selection; and (2) the “compact-horizontal ” and “matrix ” display styles are superior to the other display styles...|$|E

ABSTRACT: This paper presents the systematic way of hashing string values using NFO and NOF collision resolution strategies. NFO and NOF are techniques used for hashing <b>numeric</b> <b>keys.</b> The same principles and techniques for hashing <b>numeric</b> <b>keys</b> are deployed in the hashing of string values but with slight modifications in the hashing process and implementations. These variants followed the standard ways of evaluating and implementing algorithms to resolve collisions in hash tables. They are very effective in resolving the problem of collisions of string keys or values in the same slot of a hash table...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{explosive}} growth of information, places a high demand for Information Security. Information Security deals with securing {{the information from}} unauthorized access or misuse of information either intentionally or accidentally. Information may be represented in many forms like text, documents, audio, video, images or maps. The standard and widely used form is documents. The objective of our work is to secure information present in these documents especially in a shared environment like peer-to- peer environment. We have proposed a novel symmetric encryption method which uses XOR based extended key to encrypt all characters which includes alphabets, numerals and special characters. Our approach differs from traditional approaches which rely on <b>numeric</b> <b>key</b> values. [6], [1]. Our intention is to strengthen the confusion which inherently makes the decryption a challenging task...|$|E

In this thesis, a general software framework for multi-agent systems (MAS) and CPS is developed that facilitates the integration and configuration of KPI-related objectives into the agents' individual decision processes. It allows the user of an agent system to define new KPIs and associated multi-criteria goals and supports inter-agent coordination as well as detailed KPI-based action planning, all at runtime of the MAS. The domain-independent components of the proposed KPI framework are implemented as a Java programming library and evaluated in a simulated production planning and control scenario...|$|E

40|$|Dictionary-based {{disambiguation}} (DBD) is a {{very popular}} solution for text entry on mobile phone keypads but suffers from two problems: 1. the resolution of encoding collision (two or more words sharing the same <b>numeric</b> <b>key</b> sequence) and 2. entering out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In this paper, we present SHRIMP, a system and method that addresses these two problems by integrating DBD with camera based motion sensing that enables the user to express preference through a tilting or movement gesture. SHRIMP (Small Handheld Rapid Input with Motion and Prediction) runs on camera phones equipped with a standard 12 -key keypad. SHRIMP maintains the speed advantage of DBD driven predictive text input while enabling the user to overcome DBD collision and OOV problems seamlessly without even a mode switch. An initial empirical study demonstrates that SHRIMP can be learned very quickly, performed immediately faster than MultiTap and handled OOV words more efficiently than DBD...|$|E
