40|$|Practical {{monetary}} policy concerns and recent theoretical developments have revived {{interest in the}} concept of a "natural" equilibrium real <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> The <b>natural</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is potentially an important concept for {{monetary policy}} makers and some researchers have suggested that the concept of a "real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> gap" can be used to evaluate the stance of monetary policy or even set policy. Obtaining an estimate for the equilibrium real <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> however, is not straightforward, and the existence of alternative approaches to this task generates uncertainty about those estimates. In this paper, we discuss some conceptual, policy, and modeling issues pertaining to the U.

40|$|Central banks {{seem not}} {{to account for the}} {{influence}} of interest rates close to zero on the <b>natural</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> after the bursting of the asset bubble which triggered financial crisis. We claim that this omission may have deleterious consequences. Should interest rates close to zero persistently decrease natural interest rates, that would mean fall in TFP growth and more limited central bank’s capacity to influence aggregate demand and price dynamics. We explain that interest rates close to zero may persistently reduce the <b>natural</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> because in economy requiring post-crisis restructuring they impede that process and facilitate forbearance lending, which crowds viable economic agents out of credit through a number of channels. To reduce these risks central bank could voluntarily set the lower bound for interest rates cuts at, say, 2 %. The bound appropriate for a given economy should be a function of its growth and interest rates in the pre-crisis period. We argue that irrespective of central bank’s credibility such a change in the monetary policy conducting in economies requiring post-crisis restructuring would bring better outcomes than keeping there interest rates close to zero. ...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the fully-fledged inflation targeting (IT) regime by an important group of central banks, a measure of both the potential output and the <b>natural</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> have become one of the main concerns of the research agenda. Estimation of the <b>natural</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (NIR) is crucial to capture the stance of the monetary policy. In particular, the gap between the instrument rate of the Central Bank and the NIR can be a useful guideline for the position of the monetary policy and can also help to rationalize policy decisions. In this paper we estimate the NIR for the Peruvian Economy. We do so by applying the Kalman Filter to a semi-structural small open economy model with Peruvian data during he sample 1994 - 2005. Overall, our findings show a persistent reduction on the Peruvian NIR since 1999, which is related to an improvement on the terms of trade and a reduction on the international interest rate. Moreover, the estimated gap shows a loose monetary impulse between 1994 and 1997, tight between 1998 and 2001, and slightly loose between 2002 - 2005. Finally, the variance decomposition shows that 25 percent of fluctuations in the gap are explained by fluctuations in the NIR. According to this, a time-fixed NIR would give a quite imprecise measure of monetary policy stance. Tasa Natural de Interés, Filtro de Kalman, Política Monetaria, Perú. ...|$|E

Third, we show that recessions associated with crises lead to deeper recessions and stronger turnarounds in imbalances than during normal recessions.

40|$|Abstract: We {{determine}} optimal {{monetary policy}} under commitment in a forward-looking New Keynesian model when nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are bounded below by zero. The lower bound represents an occasionally binding constraint {{that causes the}} model and optimal policy to be nonlinear. A calibration to the U.

Rational agents anticipate the possibility of reaching the lower bound {{in the future and}} this amplifies the effects of adverse shocks well before the bound is reached. While the empirical magnitude of U.

40|$|Real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in {{the euro}} area fluctuated sharply between — 4. 2 % and + 7. 7 % {{over the past}} half century. A key {{question}} for monetary policy makers and economic agents is: What is the „neutral,” „equilibrium” or „natural” real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> to which current rates might eventually move back? In the long run, the <b>natural</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>interest</b> is influenced by productivity developments, population growth and the time preference for consumption over saving. In the medium run, the natural rate may also be influenced by fiscal policy, the structure of financial markets, and inflation risk premiums. Globalization should over time contribute to an international convergence of natural rates. Empirical estimates of the natural rate differ considerably and are associated with large error margins; estimates in „real time” suffer from additional uncertainty. Monetary policy rules based on the natural rate (e. g. Taylor rules, real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> gap) should thus be treated with great caution. Monetary policy might use the natural rate to consider appropriate responses to technological and demographic shocks. The majority of recent estimates for the euro area points to a fall in the natural rate to a level as low as 1. 5 %. This may reflect a more credible monetary policy and deep euro area financial markets, but also slowing productivity growth {{and a decline in}} the working-age population. In the future, the growing need for private savings for retirement might lower the natural rate, whereas „fiscal consolidation fatigue” might raise the <b>natural</b> <b>rate.</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> monetary policy, monetary policy rules. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{integrated}} {{trade and}} financial markets, a collapse in aggregate demand {{in a large}} country can cause "natural real interest rates" to fall below zero in all countries, giving rise to a global "liquidity trap. " This paper explores the optimal policy response {{to this type of}} shock, when governments cooperate on both fiscal and monetary policy. Adjusting to a large negative demand shock requires raising world aggregate demand, as well as redirecting demand towards the source (home) country.; The key feature of demand shocks in a liquidity trap is that relative prices respond perversely. A negative shock causes an appreciation of the home terms of trade, exacerbating the slump in the home country. At the zero bound, the home country cannot counter this shock. Because of this, it may be optimal for the foreign policymaker to raise interest rates.; Strikingly, the foreign country may choose to have a positive policy <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> even though its <b>natural</b> real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> is below zero. A combination of relatively tight monetary policy in the foreign country combined with substantial fiscal expansion in the home country achieves the desired mix in terms of the level and composition of world expenditure. Thus, in response to conditions generating a global liquidity trap, there is a critical mutual interaction between monetary and fiscal policy.
