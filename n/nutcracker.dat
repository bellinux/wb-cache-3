5|$|A {{total of}} 260 {{species of birds}} have been recorded, with raptors such as the bald eagle, golden eagle, {{peregrine}} falcon, osprey and several species of hawks residing year round. The harlequin duck is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes and waterways. The great blue heron, tundra swan, Canada goose and American wigeon are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park. Great horned owl, Clark's <b>nutcracker,</b> Steller's jay, pileated woodpecker and cedar waxwing reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and in the higher altitudes, the ptarmigan, timberline sparrow and rosy finch {{are the most likely}} to be seen. The Clark's <b>nutcracker</b> is less plentiful than in past years due to the {{decline in the number of}} whitebark pines.|$|E
5|$|The {{casting process}} of a Chinese actress {{to portray the}} heroine began in October 2016. The film was {{originally}} scheduled to be released on November 2, 2018, but it was later taken off the release schedule with The <b>Nutcracker</b> and the Four Realms taking its old slot.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky wrote many {{works that}} are {{popular with the}} {{classical}} music public, including his Romeo and Juliet, the 1812 Overture, his three ballets (The <b>Nutcracker,</b> Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty) and Marche Slave. These, along with his First Piano Concerto and his Violin Concerto, the last three of his six numbered symphonies and his operas The Queen of Spades and Eugene Onegin, are among his most familiar works. Almost as popular are the Manfred Symphony, Francesca da Rimini, the Capriccio Italien and the Serenade for Strings.|$|E
40|$|Clark’s <b>nutcrackers</b> (Nucifraga columbiana) use {{spatial memory}} to recover stored {{food in the}} field. In the present experiments, an open-field {{analogue}} of the radial arm maze was developed and {{used to test the}} ability of <b>nutcrackers</b> to remember spatial locations. The <b>nutcrackers</b> showed high levels of retention after 6 h, but were close to chance levels after a 24 -h retention interval. These results suggest that <b>nutcrackers</b> may use different spatial memory systems under different conditions. After long retention intervals, <b>nutcrackers</b> performed more accurately than pigeons tested by other experimenters using similar procedures. This raises the possibility of species differences in spatial memory, although much more research will be required to resolve this important issue...|$|R
40|$|In these experiments, {{the authors}} {{examined}} {{the nature of}} the spatial information that Clark’s <b>nutcrackers</b> (Nucifraga columbiana) use during navigation and whether this information is represented {{in the form of a}} cognitive map. In Experiment 1, <b>nutcrackers</b> were able to use distal cues to locate a small hidden goal. In Experiments 2 and 3, <b>nutcrackers</b> were given the opportunity to develop a map of a room by viewing local subsets of the landmarks in the room at a goal during training. During transfer tests, <b>nutcrackers</b> were presented with a landmark panorama that was not previously seen at the goal. Of 3 <b>nutcrackers</b> that had learned the relationship between distal cues and the goal, 3 were able to locate the goal during transfer, indicating they may have developed a cognitive map. Experiments 4 and 5 suggest that the simpler mechanism of vector integration may have been used by some <b>nutcrackers</b> during the transfer tests...|$|R
40|$|In three {{experiments}} {{in which an}} open-room delayed response task was used, we explored how Clark 2 ̆ 7 s <b>nutcrackers</b> use landmarks {{to search for a}} hidden goal when multiple potential goal locations were present. In Experiment 1, <b>nutcrackers</b> presented with three spatial samples were able to use relative local cues from an array that changed positions throughout a session to return to a hidden goal during a test. In Experiment 2, the number of samples varied from one to three prior to the test. The <b>nutcrackers</b> performed as well with one sample as with two or three samples. In Experiment 3, we attempted to increase the cost of searching for the goal but, in contrast to previous reports with <b>nutcrackers,</b> found no improvement in search accuracy. Across all experiments, search accuracy varied reliably for different goal locations, but the pattern of performance at each location was generally consistent. This result suggests that <b>nutcrackers</b> may be using different types of spatial information, depending on goal-landmark relationships...|$|R
5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's <b>nutcracker,</b> and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
5|$|Her {{mother told}} Copeland {{that she would}} have to give up ballet, but Bradley wanted Copeland to {{continue}} and offered to host her. DelaCerna agreed to this, and Copeland moved in with Bradley and her family. Eventually, Copeland and DelaCerna signed a management contract and a life-story contract with Bradley. Copeland spent the weekdays with the Bradleys near the coast and the weekends at home with her mother, a two-hour bus ride away. Copeland would spend most of her next three years with the Bradleys. By the age of fourteen, Copeland was the winner of a national ballet contest and won her first solo role. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to books and videos about ballet. When she saw Paloma Herrera, a principal ballerina with ABT, perform at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Copeland began to idolize her as much as she did Mariah Carey. The media first noticed her when she drew 2,000 patrons per show as she performed as Clara in The <b>Nutcracker</b> at the San Pedro High School after only eight months of study. A larger role as Kitri in Don Quixote at the San Pedro Dance Center and a featured role in The Chocolate <b>Nutcracker,</b> an African American version of the tale, narrated by Debbie Allen, soon followed. The latter was presented at UCLA's Royce Hall. Copeland's role was modified especially for her, and included ethnic dances.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her return}} to the stage, she danced the Queen of the Dryads in Don Quixote in May 2013. Nelson George began filming a {{documentary}} leverage the chance to present her comeback. Copeland reprised her role as Gulnare in June 2013 in the pirate-themed Le Corsaire. She also played an Odalisque in the same ballet. Later in the year, she danced in Tharp's choreography of Bach Partita for Violin No. 2 in D minor for solo violin, and as Columbine in ABT's revival of Ratmansky's <b>Nutcracker</b> at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.|$|E
50|$|Clark's <b>nutcrackers</b> pluck P. longaeva seeds out of {{the opening}} cones. The <b>nutcrackers</b> use the seeds as a food resource, storing many for later use in the ground, {{and some of these}} stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new plants.|$|R
40|$|Clark’s <b>nutcrackers</b> (Nucifraga columbiana) {{were trained}} {{to search for a}} hidden goal located {{in the center of a}} four-landmark array. Upon {{completion}} of training, the <b>nutcrackers</b> were presented with tests that expanded the landmark array in the east-west direction, north-south direction and in both directions simultaneously. Although the birds learned to search accurately at the center of the landmark array during training, this search pattern did not transfer to the expansion tests. The <b>nutcrackers</b> searched at locations defined by absolute distance and/or direction relationships with landmarks in the training array. These results contrast with those from experiments with <b>nutcrackers</b> in which an abstract geometric rule was learned. This difference appears due to differences in the experimental paradigms used during training...|$|R
5000|$|Manufacturers produce modern {{functional}} <b>nutcrackers</b> usually somewhat resembling pliers, {{but with}} the pivot point at the end beyond the nut, {{rather than in the}} middle. These are also used for cracking the shells of crab and lobster to make the meat inside available for eating. Hinged lever <b>nutcrackers,</b> often called a [...] "pair of nutcrackers", may date back to Ancient Greece. By the 14th century in Europe, <b>nutcrackers</b> were documented in England, including in the Canterbury Tales, and in France. The lever design may derive from blacksmiths' pincers. Materials included metals such as silver, cast-iron and bronze, and wood including boxwood, especially those from France and Italy. More rarely, porcelain was used. Many of the wooden carved <b>nutcrackers</b> were in the form of people and animals.|$|R
5|$|Whitebark pine {{communities}} have been heavily damaged {{due to the}} effects of blister rust, a non native fungus. In Glacier and the surrounding region, 30% of the whitebark pine trees have died and over 70% of the remaining trees are currently infected. The whitebark pine provides a high fat pine cone seed, commonly known as the pine nut, that is a favorite food of red squirrels and Clark's <b>nutcracker.</b> Both grizzlies and black bears are known to raid squirrel caches of pine nuts, one of the bears' favorite foods. Between 1930 and 1970, efforts to control the spread of blister rust were unsuccessful, and continued destruction of whitebark pines appears likely, with attendant negative impacts on dependent species.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the harsh}} winters, {{the park has}} few reptile and {{amphibian}} species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds {{can be found in}} Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the gray jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's <b>nutcracker,</b> mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.|$|E
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A <b>nutcracker</b> esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
25|$|Clark's <b>nutcrackers</b> and jackdaws were {{compared}} in a 2002 study based on geometric rule learning. The corvids, {{along with a}} domestic pigeon, had to locate a target between two landmarks, while distances and landmarks were altered. The <b>nutcrackers</b> were more accurate in their searches than the jackdaws and pigeons.|$|R
50|$|During the Victorian era, {{fruit and}} nuts were {{presented}} at dinner and ornate and often silver-plated <b>nutcrackers</b> were produced to accompany {{them on the}} dinner table. Nuts have long been a popular choice for desserts, particularly throughout Europe. The <b>nutcrackers</b> were placed on dining tables {{to serve as a}} fun and entertaining center of conversation while diners awaited their final course. At one time, <b>nutcrackers</b> were actually made of metals such as brass, and {{it was not until the}} 1800s in Germany that the popularity of wooden ones began to spread.|$|R
2500|$|A bronze Roman piece c. 200 BC to 200 AD {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} in the museum – it was {{discovered}} in 1960 and is a rare item that was unearthed after over 1,800 years. Wagner bought the item from Rik Gijsen, a Netherlands-based antiquities dealer. The piece was acquired by the museum in April 2006. Approximately 1,000 of the <b>nutcrackers</b> from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of <b>Nutcrackers.</b> The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April. Arlene and George Wagner traveled the globe in search of <b>nutcrackers</b> for the museum: [...] "That's all we do! My husband and I have never been on a cruise. We just got back from Europe yesterday, hunting for <b>nutcrackers.</b> We went to the Netherlands. We attended a couple of very big European antique shows. We also had <b>nutcrackers</b> waiting for us to pick up – very valuable 16th and 17th century ones." ...|$|R
5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good shoes {{in the snow and}} filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a <b>nutcracker</b> or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E
5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors {{that live in the}} forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's <b>nutcracker</b> with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and ruffed grouse and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E
5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's <b>nutcracker</b> {{are found in the}} backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the whooping crane.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{tested the}} spatial memory of {{serially}} presented locations in Clark’s <b>nutcrackers</b> (Nucifraga columbiana). Birds were serially presented with locations {{in an open}} room. The authors buried a seed in a sand-filled cup at each location and then tested <b>nutcrackers</b> for their memory for each location in the list by using the cluster method. For each item in the list, the authors opened a cluster of 6 holes. Accuracy was measured by how many tries were required for the bird to find the correct location within each cluster. In Experiments 1 and 2, the authors presented 2 lists of locations and found evidence for proactive and retroactive interference. <b>Nutcrackers</b> made errors by visiting the interfering list of locations during recovery of the target list. This finding demonstrates that <b>nutcrackers</b> are susceptible to proactive and retroactive interference during the recall of spatial information...|$|R

40|$|Clark’s <b>nutcrackers</b> use {{spatial memory}} to recover stored {{food in the}} field and have {{performed}} very well in laboratory tests of spatial memory. During the present experiment, two groups of <b>nutcrackers</b> cached seeds every 4 days. Following each cache session, the stay group was tested with seeds in their caches; the shift group found seeds in novel sites. The stay group performed accurately throughout the experiment, but the shift group gave no indication of being able to learn to avoid sites where they had stored seeds. These results suggest that although <b>nutcrackers</b> can learn to shift away from remembered locations during some memory experiments, they cannot learn to shift away from cache sites. This raises interesting questions about the relationship between task characteristics, response strategies, and memory...|$|R
40|$|Clark 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Nutcrackers</b> (Nucifraga columbiana) are {{important}} seed dispersers {{for at least}} 10 species of conifer in western North America and are obligate mutualists for the subalpine tree, whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis). Despite the important role they play in forest regeneration, space use by <b>nutcrackers</b> has not been formally studied. Several hypotheses exist to explain their year-round space use patterns. I tested one hypothesis that Clark 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Nutcrackers</b> migrate altitudinally between summer and autumn in one population in the Cascade Range, Washington. In 2006 and 2007, I compared seasonal differences in summer and autumn space use by 26 radio tagged <b>nutcrackers.</b> Five <b>nutcrackers</b> remained as year-round residents on their home ranges and 21 emigrated from the study area in summer. Among residents I found summer and autumn ranges overlapped and summer ranges were contained within autumn ranges. Residents increased their use of low elevation habitats as autumn progressed but rather than migrating from summer ranges, they used low elevation forests only for seed harvesting. High elevation portions of the summer range were used for all other activities including seed storage even though this required residents to transport seeds from harvest trees up to 29 km in distance and 1007 m in elevation. I was unable to test hypotheses regarding space use by emigrants. However, my results suggest that emigrants in {{this study did not}} migrate altitudinally because they did not show a seasonal trend in movements either upslope or downslope...|$|R
