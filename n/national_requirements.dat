500|$|Since the 1870s, Cornell's {{system of}} fraternities and sororities grew {{to play a}} large role in student life, with many {{chapters}} becoming a part of national organizations. [...] As of 1952, 19 fraternities had national restrictions based on race, religion or national origin, and of the 32 fraternities without such <b>national</b> <b>requirements,</b> 19 did not have [...] "mixed" [...] memberships. [...] In response, the undergraduate Interfraternity Council passed a resolution condemning discrimination. In the 1960s, the Trustees established a Commission to examine the membership restrictions of those national organizations. [...] Cornell adopted a policy that required fraternities and sororities affiliated with nationals that discriminated based on religion or race to either amend their national charters or quit the national organizations. [...] As a result, a number of national Greek organizations dropped racial or religious barriers to their membership.|$|E

50|$|Cotton {{production}} expanded {{rapidly in}} the early and mid-1970s, reaching 24,000 tons in 1977, but it fell back to one-third of this figure in 1989. Since the reorganization of the Ghana Cotton Development Board into the Ghana Cotton Company, cotton production steadily increased from 4 percent of the country's <b>national</b> <b>requirement</b> to 50 percent in 1990. Between 1986 and 1989, Ghana saved US$6 million through local lint cotton production. The company expected that between 1991 and 1995, about 20,000 hectares of land would be put under cotton cultivation, enabling Ghana to produce 95 percent of the <b>national</b> <b>requirement.</b>|$|R
500|$|An RAAF team {{headed by}} the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Charles Read, {{was sent to the}} United States in May 1970 to {{negotiate}} the lease arrangements. After considering the proposed deal, Read recommended that it go ahead; according to RAAF historian Alan Stephens this decision [...] "delighted RAAF senior officers and aircrews". The Cabinet subsequently approved the lease of 24 Phantoms for two years at a total cost of $US 41.554 million (including training, spare parts and technical advice) and the formal agreement to do so was signed on 29June 1970. The USAF designated this project Peace Reef. The terms of the lease agreement allowed the Australian Government to purchase the Phantoms outright if the F-111C program was cancelled, but also allowed the USAF to demand the immediate return of the aircraft and their support equipment {{in the event of a}} national emergency. Laird provided Fraser with a written commitment that this option would not be exercised, and it was never publicised. Laird also promised that USAF tankers would be made available to support the Australian Phantoms during crises, subject to American <b>national</b> <b>requirements</b> and the terms of relevant agreements between the two countries.|$|E

2500|$|EMT {{training}} programs for certification vary greatly from course to course, provided that each course at least meets local and <b>national</b> <b>requirements.</b> In the United States, EMR's receive at least 40–80 hours of classroom training, EMTs receive at least 120–180 hours of classroom training. [...] AEMTs generally have 200–500 hours of training, and Paramedics are trained for 1,000–1,800 hours or more. In addition, a minimum number of continuing education (CE) hours are required to maintain certification. For example, to maintain NREMT certification, EMTs must obtain at least 48 hours of additional education and either complete a 24-hour refresher course or complete an additional 24 hours of CEs that would cover, on an hour by hour basis, the same topics as the refresher course would. Recertification for other levels follows a similar pattern.|$|E
