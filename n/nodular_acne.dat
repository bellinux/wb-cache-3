5|$|Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe <b>nodular</b> <b>acne,</b> and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4â€“6month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of patients require a second course.

Isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete.

40|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a common}} {{dermatosis}} affecting 80 % of the population. To date, different treatments haveAbstract been used to manage this condition. Antibacterials and retinoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for acne, but their success rate varies. Phototherapy is emerging as an alternative option to treat acne vulgaris. Studies examining the role of different wavelengths and methods of light treatment have shown that phototherapy with visible light, specifically blue light, has a marked effect on inflammatory acne lesions and seems sufficient {{for the treatment of}} acne. In addition, the combination of blue-red light radiation seems to be superior to blue light alone, with minimal adverse effects. Photodynamic therapy has also been used, even in <b>nodular</b> and cystic <b>acne,</b> and had excellent therapeutic outcomes, although with significant adverse effects. Recently, low energy pulsed dye laser therapy has been used, and seems to be a promising alternative that would allow the simultaneous treatment of active acne and acne scarring.

40|$|Isotretinoin is {{the drug}} of choice for the {{management}} of severe recalcitrant <b>nodular</b> <b>acne.</b> Nevertheless, some of its physical-chemical properties are still poorly known. Hence, the aim of our study consisted to comparatively evaluate the particle size distribution (PSD) and characterize the thermal behavior of the three encapsulated isotretinoin products in oil suspension (one reference and two generics) commercialized in Brazil. Here, we show that the PSD, estimated by laser diffraction and by polarized light microscopy, differed between the generics and the reference product. However, the thermal behavior of the three products, determined by thermogravimetry (TGA), differential thermal (DTA) analyses and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), displayed no significant changes and were more thermostable than the isotretinoin standard used as internal control. Thus, our study suggests that PSD analyses in isotretinoin lipid-based formulations should be routinely performed in order to improve their quality and bioavailability. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Purpose: Our aim in {{this study}} was to assess the ocular surface and tear film changes in acne vulgaris {{patients}} receiving systemic isotretinoin. Material and Method: Twenty-two eyes of 22 patients who received oral isotretinoin (roaccutaneÂ®, 0. 7 mg/kg/day) for <b>nodular</b> <b>acne</b> vulgaris were enrolled in this prospective study. Tear film break-up time (BUT), Schirmer 1 test scores with anesthesia, ocular surface disease index (OSDI) scores and conjunctival impression cytology scores were recorded before treatment and at 3 - and 6 -month visits following the beginning of treatment. Results: BUT values decreased and OSDI scores significantly increased at 3 months after treatment (p= 0. 007 and p= 0. 018, paired samples test). Schirmer scores did not significantly change by isotretinoin treatment. Of 9 eyes with impression cytology specimens, 4 revealed normal conjunctival findings before treatment. At the 3 rd month, there was an increase in the scores characterized by decrease of Goblet cells, and at 6 months of treatment, normal conjunctival findings did not exist in any of the patients (p= 0. 004, Friedman test).

Young, adult male mice received 13 -cis-RA (1 mg/kg) by daily intraperitoneal injection for 6 weeks. This treatment paradigm produced plasma levels of 13 -cis-RA that are comparable to those reported in human patients taking Accutane. In both the forced swim test and the tail suspension test, we found that 13 -cis-RA-treated mice spent significantly more time immobile compared to vehicle-treated controls. In the open field test, there was no change in anxiety-related behavior in 13 -cis-RA- treated mice. Furthermore, chronic administration of 13 -cis-RA did not impair locomotion in either the open field or the rotarod test.

40|$|Acne vulgaris is an {{inflammation}} in the sebaceous glands in the skin. It is multifactorial, but {{the pathogenesis}} {{can be divided}} into four main factors. They are Propionibacterium acnes, proinflammatory cytokines that get released by P. acnes, hyperkeratinization and excessive sebum production. The condition is often associated with puberty. Oral isotretinoin is a medication given to patients with severe recalcitrant <b>nodular</b> <b>acne,</b> which is, defined as several inflammatory lesions more than 5 mm in diameter, that is unresponsive to conventional therapy as topical and systemic antibiotics. Isotretinoin treatment gets started after both urine and blood samples are taken. The aim {{of this study is to}} review some of the side effects observed from isotretinoin use and figure out whether the risk of taking the medication weighs stronger than the effect. The chosen side effects are mucocutaneous side effects and hyperlipidemia, which have been thoroughly looked into. An additional goal is to review if these side effects are chronic and if not, how long they will persist before they disappear. The majority of the studies all agree that the side effects from isotretinoin use, fade away after the treatment is done. So far no patient has had any persistent mucocutaneous side effects or hyperlipidemia with fatal consequences. But more studies need to be done on this topic...|$|E
40|$|AIM: The {{purpose of}} the study was to analyze the {{potential}} capacity of a dietary supplement, based on gamma linolenic acid, vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-carotene, coenzyme Q 10 and Vitis Vitifera, to reduce side effects, in particular the dry skin, erythema and desquamation, due to treatment with oral isotretinoin, and evaluate the ability of the product to increase adherence to therapy in patients with acne. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with <b>nodular</b> <b>acne</b> (32 females and 16 males) were randomly divided into 2 groups: 24 receveid isotretinoin therapy (20 - 30 mg/day) for 6 months associated to dietary supplement (twice a day), while the other 24 patients received only isotretinoin (20 - 30 mg/day) for 6 months. For all patients the degree of acne severity, through GAGS (Global Acne Grading System), the sebum production by Sebutape, the hydration by Corneometer and the erythema by Mexameter, were measured. We have also evaluated the adherence to treatment, asking to patients how many days a week they follow the therapy. RERSULTS: Patients treated with dietary supplement had lower side effects, with a less degree of erythema and dryness, and greater degree of hydration; a greater adherence to therapy was also reported. CONCLUSION: Thanks to antioxidant and moisturizing properties, the dietary supplement containing gamma linolenic acid, vitamin E, vitamin C, betacarotene, coenzyme Q 10 and Vitis Vitifera, can be considered a useful supplement in the treatment and prevention of dry skin associated with the use of oral isotretinoin...|$|E

The clinical lesions are non-inflammatory open and closed comedones and or papules, pustules and nodules of varying degree of inflammation and depth. A lot of steroid, cosmetic and Ayurvedic products containing unlabeled depigmenting agent and steroids are available readily over the counter sale. The side effects of these products are not documented {{and can lead to}} adverse effects of continuous usage. This study was aimed to find out various offending depigmenting agents (topical unlabeled steroid containing cosmetics) for treatment of Acne and its side effects with type of offering persons. This study was conducted on 1110 OPD patient of which 1000 (90. 10 %) patients are using steroid and unlabeled steroid containing cosmetics and only 110 (9. 90 %) patient not using any topical application. Mostly affected common age group was 11 - 20 years (58 %) with slight female preponderance (M:F 0. 96). Urban patients were more affected than rural (74 % v/s 26 %). Unmarrieds (76 %) were more affected than married (24 %). Friends appeared as chief culprit or suggestions given to them (39 %) followed by family member(13. 5 %), self-application (12 %) influenced by advertisements, chemist(11. 5 %), general practitioner (9. 5 %), neighbor (4. 5 %), compounder(1. 5 %), parlor(2 %) and only 2 % by dermatologist.

In the MRN, the number of 5 -HT immunolabelled cells was 1815 Â± 194 in control, compared with 1954 Â± 111 in previous term 13 -cisnext term-RA treated tissues. The number of 5 -HT immunolabelled cells was much higher in the DRN, with 7148 Â± 377 cells in the control, compared with 7578 Â± 424 in the previous term 13 -cisnext term-RA treated group. Further analysis of the DRN revealed that there were no changes in the number of 5 -HT neurons within distinct subregions of the DRN. Similarly, changes in the density of serotoninergic neurons or in the volume of the MRN or DRN were not observed in previous term 13 -cisnext term-RA treated animals.
