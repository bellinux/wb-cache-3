40|$|Concern {{over the}} {{interference}} of stray radiofrequency (RF) emissions with key aircraft avionics is evident during takeoff and landing of every commercial flight when {{the flight attendant}} requests that all portable electronics be switched off.

40|$|Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) is a {{surveillance}} system onboard aircraft that periodically transmits its state vector estimates.

40|$|The {{demand for}} fuel {{efficient}} flight paths which include shorter routes and routes {{adapted to the}} prevailing terrain {{as well as the}} aim to reduce the perceived noise {{on the ground in the}} terminal area of airports lead to the development of curved approach procedures. To be able to conduct curved approach procedures, an aircraft is on the one hand required to be able to determine its position very precisely. On the other hand, it is required to be able to follow the required flight path very accurately. The first is usually archived with satellite navigation or a combination of different <b>navigation</b> systems <b>and</b> the latter can be achieved by an autopilot which has to be rather sophisticated when intending to follow a curved approach path. This indicates that an aircraft has to be highly equipped with <b>navigation</b> <b>and</b> guidance <b>avionics</b> systems. To fully exploit the advantages of curved approach procedures, it is desired that the majority of aircraft are able to conduct curved approach procedures even with a less sophisticated degree of equipage. A key enabler for curved approach procedures is a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS). It broadcasts pseudorange corrections for all satellites in view to enable airspace users to augment their own position. In addition, it broadcasts desired flight paths. Next to standard “straight-in” Final Approach Segments (FAS), GBAS messages are defined in the RTCA standard DO- 246 D that provide the possibility to broadcast curved precision approach paths. This Terminal Area Path (TAP) functionality in combination with the augmentation of the user’s position can be used as a sole means to conduct a curved approach. The advantage of this setup is that a high accuracy and a high integrity in the lateral as well as in the vertical position domain can be achieved and the aircraft does not have to be equipped with a current database for the published approach procedures. Different ways to present flight path data were investigated and flight tested in this work. ...|$|R
40|$|Small {{satellites}} {{are becoming}} ever {{more capable of}} performing valuable missions for both government and commercial customers. However, currently these satellites can be launched affordably only as secondary payloads. This {{makes it difficult for}} the small satellite mission to launch when needed, to the desired orbit, and with acceptable risk. What is needed is a class of low-cost launchers, so that launch costs to low-Earth orbit (LEO) are commensurate with payload costs. Several private and government-sponsored launch vehicle developers are working toward just that-the ability to affordably insert small payloads into LEO. But until now, cost of the complex avionics remained disproportionately high. AVA (Affordable Vehicle Avionics) solves this problem. Significant contributors to the cost of launching nanosatellites to orbit are the <b>avionics</b> <b>and</b> software systems that steer and control the launch vehicles, sequence stage separation, deploy payloads, and telemeter data. The high costs of these guidance, <b>navigation</b> <b>and</b> control (GNC) <b>avionics</b> systems are {{due in part to the}} current practice of developing unique, single-use hardware and software for each launch. High-performance, high-reliability inertial sensors components with heritage from legacy launchers also contribute to costs-but can low-cost commercial inertial sensors work just as well? NASA Ames Research Center has developed and tested a prototype low-cost avionics package for space launch vehicles that provides complete GNC functionality in a package smaller than a tissue box (100 millimeters by 120 millimeters by 69 millimeters; 4 inches by 4. 7 inches by 2. 7 inches), with a mass of less than 0. 84 kilogram (2 pounds. AVA takes advantage of commercially available, low-cost, mass-produced, miniaturized sensors, filtering their more noisy inertial data with real-time GPS (Global Positioning Satellite) data.

40|$|Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is a {{surveillance}} system placed in aircraft that periodically transmits state vector estimates {{and other information}} to air traffic control centers and other nearby aircraft (and may also receive traffic and weather information from various entities).

A systematic and comprehensive performance monitoring system is required to ensure the safe use of ADS-B data for air traffic control operations. It is vital that such monitoring systems are in place before a global ADS-B implementation date is mandated by the International Civil Aviation Organization.
