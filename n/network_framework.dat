The system runs on Amazon EC2, and only requires a cluster of 5 GPU instances to handle daily image uploads onto Pinterest. By using reverse image search, Pinterest is able to extract visual features from fashion objects (e.g. shoes, dress, glasses, bag, watch, pants, shorts, bikini, earrings) and offer product recommendations that look similar.|$|E

As more and more practical applications employing the framework are being developed, it becomes apparent that the framework lacks with regard to explicit means for exerting control over reasoning. In this paper, we extend the belief <b>network</b> <b>framework</b> with a method for selective gathering of evidence for diagnostic applications. To this end, a belief network architecture is developed consisting of two layers: a probabilistic layer specifying a belief network and its associated algorithms, and a control layer providing the method for evidence gathering. 1 Introduction Halfway through the 1980 s, the theory of belief networks was introduced for reasoning with uncertainty in knowledge-based systems.
