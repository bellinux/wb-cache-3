40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis shows that failure of some financial institutions can cause other banks to fail and ultimately cause {{damage to the}} financial system worldwide. Eurozone banks that experienced either liquidity or solvency problems during the finan- cial markets turmoil were bailed out by their national governments with the financial support and supervision of the European Union. This paper applies the boosted classification tree methodology to predict failure in the banking sector and identifies four key scor- ecard variables that are worth tracking closely in order to anticipate and prevent bank financial distress. The data {{used in this study}} comprises 2006 - 2012 annual series of 25 financial ratios of 155 banks in the Eurozone. The findings indicate that the greater the size and the higher the income from non-operating items and <b>net</b> <b>loans</b> to <b>deposits,</b> the more likely is bank failure; conversely, the higher the Interbank ratio the lower the chances of bank financial distress. For the sake of their own financial soundness, banks should fund lending activities through clients' deposits and should avoid relying excessively on non-recurring sources of income...|$|R
40|$|The banking {{sector is}} viewed as an {{important}} source of financing for many businesses. In order to appraise and weigh up the soundness and reliability of banking industry, the information on the risk and how the fluctuations are managed are important to consider. Among the financial risks liquidity {{is one of the most}} crucial to consider. Appalling financial condition of the banks has led to incessant decrease in the banks value of assets. The study examined the impact of risk components on the banks performance in Nigeria. Data was source from a ten years annual reports and financial statements of fourteen listed banks at the Nigerian stock exchange and a panel data estimation technique adopted. The result showed that the credit risk indicators of ratio of total equity to total asset and ratio of equity to depositors to short-term funding has positive and negative effect respectively on return on asset (ROA). Also the liquidity risk indicator of ratio of <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> to total asset and <b>net</b> <b>loans</b> to <b>deposit</b> and short-term funding has negative and positive effect respectively on ROA. In view of this, the study recommended setting up credit policy that will not negatively affects profitability and liquidity model which predicts the liquidity requirements of banks should be designed so that they can fix up any liquidity risk and its problems within a reasonable tolerance...|$|R

The paper studies the effect of bank capital structure and financial indicators in Middle Eastern commercial banks associated with high and low ratings issued by Capital Intelligence (CI). The authors also investigate how bank capital structure and financial indicators can be differentiated between banks with high and low ratings, using the multinomial logit technique. A sample of 65 rated commercial banks from eleven countries is used. The article focuses on commercial banks {{in order to avoid}} comparison problems between various types of banks. The data is taken from the Bankscope database and covers the period of 1994 - 2007. The results reveal that the financial indicators of the highly-rated banks are associated with decreases in the ratio of impaired loans to gross loans, the ratio of loan loss reserve to gross loans, the ratio of non-interest expenses to total assets, the ratio of <b>net</b> <b>loans</b> to <b>deposits</b> and short-term funding and the ratio of <b>net</b> <b>loans</b> to total assets. In contrast, these financial indicators are allied to an increase in the ratio of non-operating income to net income, the gap ratio, the interbank ratio and the equity ratio. The robustness of the results is quite obvious since the financial indicators associated with highly-rated banks are the opposite of those associated with low-rated banks. In view of the findings, some policy implications can be drawn that may be useful for bank management and policymakers in the Middle East region...|$|R

Since the beginning of the new century, <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> default has caused P 2 P companies to break up funds and operate without continuity, which has become an important factor affecting the healthy development of the industry. Therefore, starting from the actual management situation of P 2 P <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> platform, the default risk of <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> was studied based on Spark technology in wireless network environment.

30|$|The latest {{model of}} the Internet {{innovation}} finance P 2 P <b>net</b> <b>loan,</b> although it was born less than 10  years, subversive changes to the global financial lending model has been brought. In the P 2 P platform, the <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> business is welcomed and loved by the ordinary consumers because {{of the advantages of}} flexible borrowing methods, fast money to account, and so on, which is also the most important market competition ability of the P 2 P platform [7]. In the survey of the development data {{of a large number of}} P 2 P companies in China, it is found that the main factors that cannot effectively control the credit risk of the network directly affect the health business development of the P 2 P <b>net</b> <b>loan,</b> which is how to control the risk of the <b>net</b> <b>loan.</b> The risk of <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> default brings serious consequences to the P 2 P platform, such as slow return of capital, fragmentation of capital chain, bankruptcy, and liquidation of enterprises. These consequences bring about economic losses that P 2 P companies and investors cannot recover and also cast a shadow on the healthy and sustainable development of the entire P 2 P industry [8]. In the analysis of P 2 P network credit management, it is seen that the risk nature of the credit risk in the network loan platform and the traditional bank lending is the same, because the borrower is unable to achieve the initial repayment agreement under various factors, making the interest of the <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> company damaged. Or the <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> company is unable to repay the agreed interest rate. There are differences between investors’ actual interests and contractual agreements, and personal economic interests are infringed [9]. The advantage of fast loan in network lending is also a great potential risk. For borrowers, information audit time is too short and information collection is limited, which may bring about credit default such as default and non-repayment [10]. Using a decision tree algorithm to study credit default risk of P 2 P <b>net</b> <b>loan</b> has a good theoretical foundation. Mathematical models can be used to analyze the impact of risk more effectively and quantitatively determined the consequences that may be caused by different factors. In view of different risk factors, this paper puts forward specific control measures to curb default risk from the source.|$|R

From the controlling theory point of view, bank was presented as an object, that can be controlled by pricing and which is affected by random lags in loans returning. Pricing influences money flows from bank?s <b>loan</b> and <b>deposit</b> activity via function of demand on loans and function of supply of deposits, and these flows influence bank profit and capital. Volumes of <b>loan</b> and <b>deposit</b> activities depend on bank capital, therefore there is a dynamics in the model.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5, {{at the end}} of June 2017, the largest {{fraction}} of <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> granted by Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem were loans to Households, followed by bank-to-bank <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> and <b>loans</b> to Non-Financial Corporations, amounting to around 5.49, 4.48, and 4.32 trillion euros, respectively. More specifically, from the macro-network analysis of the financial exposures via <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits,</b> we can notice that, despite the fact that a large fraction of <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> granted by Monetary and Financial Institutions is intra-financial (7.53 trillion euros), the most relevant portion is granted by the private banking sector to the real sector (9.81 trillion euros), followed by <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> to the Rest of the World and public sector (amounting to 2.65 and 1.05 trillion euros, respectively). Unfortunately, available data on the institutional sector Rest of the World do not allow us to discriminate between real sector and financial sector of non-euro area countries receiving the aforementioned amount of <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> by the euro area private banking system. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that, the disaggregation of Monetary Financial Institutions in Eurosystem and Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem, not only {{from the point of view}} of the sector granting the <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits,</b> such as in Perillo and Battiston (2017), but also from the perspective of the institutional sector receiving them, allows us to discriminate among bank-to-bank <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> (4.48 trillion euros), <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> granted by the private banking system to the Eurosystem (1.72 trillion euros), and <b>loans</b> and <b>deposits</b> granted and received within the Eurosystem (2.27 trillion euros). The latter category belongs to the so-called TARGET balances, i.e., intra-Eurosystem assets and liabilities of central banks’ balance sheet resulting from net cross-border payments in the form of central bank reserves, via the Eurosystem real-time payment system, which settles continuously euro-denominated payments on an individual transaction-by-transaction basis without netting (called TARGET 2)(Eisenschmidt et al. 2017).|$|R
