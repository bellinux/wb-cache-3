25|$|Patricia de Lille, current {{mayor of}} Cape Town {{and founder of}} the now-defunct Independent Democrats, does not use the label Coloured but many {{observers}} would consider her as Coloured by visible appearance. The Independent Democrats party sought the Coloured vote and gained significant ground in the municipal and local elections in 2006, particularly in districts in the Western Cape with high proportions of Coloured residents. The firebrand Peter Marais (formerly a provincial leader of the New National Party) has sought to portray his <b>New</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> as the political voice for Coloured people.|$|E
2500|$|Almost immediately, the <b>new</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> became {{involved}} in the acrimonious debate about conscription, which arose during World War I – the Labour Party strongly opposed conscription, several leaders were jailed and expelled from Parliament for their stand against the war: Peter Fraser, [...] Harry Holland, Bob Semple and Paddy Webb. The loss of leadership threatened to seriously destabilise the party, but the party survived. Fraser, Semple and Webb later supported conscription in World War II.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{expansion}} of the line was suggested by Director Garstad in 1933, but {{was rejected by the}} board. The [...] proposal would have expanded the line to add an additional station, Asbjørnsens gate, at the intersection of Tyholtveien, Asbjørnsens gate and Henrik Mathisens vei. The costs were estimated at NOK65,000, and calculations showed a positive net present value. Despite that the city chief of administration was opposed to the proposal, the city council passed the {{expansion of}} 28 March 1935. This was in part based on the <b>new</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> majority, who wanted to create more jobs. As part of the suggestion, the tram company had to advance the costs of rebuilding the road to the city road department. The expansion was opened on 29 September, allowing ridership to increase by 11.2 percent to 1.6 million.|$|E

2500|$|Through campaigning {{within the}} Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Young Socialists, a <b>new</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> youth movement, the Socialist Review Group {{was able to}} recruit among a new {{generation}} of activists and by 1964 had a membership of 200. In 1959, the first edition of Cliff's book on Rosa Luxemburg was published. In this Cliff asserts:"Rosa Luxemburg's conception {{of the structure of the}} revolutionary organisation – that they should be built from below up, on a consistently democratic basis – fits the needs of the workers' movement in the advanced countries much more closely than Lenin's conception of 1902−4, which was copied and given an added bureaucratic twist by Stalinists the world over." [...] Cliff wrote in 1960 that Trotsky's insight in 1904 about Lenin's substitutionism, was a strong warning of the serious flaws [...] "inherent in Lenin’s conception of party organisation" [...] sustained by events since 1917.|$|E
60|$|Then came {{a period}} when one was going about {{receiving}} and giving congratulations and watching the other men arrive, very like a boy who has returned to school with the first batch after the holidays. The London world reeked with the General Election; it had invaded the nurseries. All the children of one's friends had got big maps of England cut up into squares to represent constituencies and were busy sticking gummed blue labels over the conquered red of Unionism that had hitherto submerged the country. And there were also orange labels, if I remember rightly, to represent the <b>new</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>party,</b> and green for the Irish. I engaged myself to speak at one or two London meetings, and lunched at the Reform, which was fairly tepid, and dined and spent one or two tumultuous evenings at the National Liberal Club, which was in active eruption. The National Liberal became feverishly congested towards midnight as {{the results of the}} counting came dropping in. A big green-baize screen had been fixed up {{at one end of the}} large smoking-room with the names of the constituencies that were voting that day, and directly the figures came to hand, up they went, amidst cheers that at last lost their energy through sheer repetition, whenever there was record of a Liberal gain. I don't remember what happened when there was a Liberal loss; I don't think that any were announced while I was there.|$|E
6000|$|With the {{majority}} of Americans, however, the word [...] "labour" [...] as designating a party arouses suspicion and distrust. By nature and tradition we are inclined to deplore and oppose any tendency toward the stratification of class antagonisms--the result of industrial discontent--into political groups. The British tradition is likewise hostile to such a tendency. But in Britain the industrial ferment has gone much further than with us, and such a result was inevitable. By {{taking advantage of the}} British experience, of the closer ties now being knit between the two democracies, we may in America be spared a stage which in Britain was necessary. Indeed, the program of the new British Labour Party seems to point to a distinctly American solution, one in harmony with the steady growth of Anglo-Saxon democracy. For it is now announced that the word [...] "labour," [...] as applied to the new party, does not mean manual labour alone, but also mental labour. The British unions have gradually developed and placed in power leaders educated in social science, who have now come into touch with the intellectual leaders of the United Kingdom, with the sociologists, economists, and social scientists. The surprising and encouraging result of such association is the announcement that the <b>new</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> is today publicly thrown open to all workers, both by hand and by brain, with the object of securing for these the full fruits of their industry. This means the inclusion of physicians, professors, writers, architects, engineers, and inventors, of lawyers who no longer regard their profession as a bulwark of the status quo; of clerks, of administrators of the type evolved by the war, who indeed have gained their skill under the old order but who now in a social spirit are dedicating their gifts to the common weal, organizing and directing vast enterprises for their governments. In short, all useful citizens who make worthy contributions--as distinguished from parasites, profiteers, and drones, are invited to be members; there is no class distinction here. The fortunes of such a party are, of course, dependent upon the military success of the allied armies and navies. But it has defined the kind of democracy the Allies are fighting for, and thus has brought about an unqualified endorsement of the war by those elements of the population which hitherto have felt the issue to be imperialistic and vague rather than democratic and clear cut. President Wilson's international program is approved of and elaborated.|$|E
40|$|This article {{draws from}} the fields of {{political}} science and of organisational studies to explore the short-term and longterm impact of <b>New</b> <b>Labour’s</b> <b>party</b> management {{on the quality of}} party processes as well as on party reputation. It is based on the long-term ethnographic participant observation of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> at local and regional levels, as well as national events such as annual conferences. The article starts by identifying the distinctive features of <b>New</b> <b>Labour’s</b> <b>party</b> management. It then examines the “unintended consequences” of this brand of party management, showing this model to be mainly self-defeating. The final section provides a general assessment of the impact of <b>New</b> <b>Labour’s</b> <b>party</b> management from the perspective of organisational learning and innovation. Overall the article stresses the long-term poisonous effects of this brand of leadership and management on political organisations and on politics in general. (author's abstract...|$|R
