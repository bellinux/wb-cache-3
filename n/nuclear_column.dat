40|$|Kiloparsec-scale binary active galactic nuclei (AGNs) signal active {{supermassive black}} hole (SMBH) pairs in merging galaxies. Despite their significance, {{unambiguously}} confirmed cases remain scarce {{and most have}} been discovered serendipitously. In a previous systematic search, we optically identified four kpc-scale binary AGNs from candidates selected with double-peaked narrow emission lines at redshifts of 0. 1 [...] 0. 2. Here we present Chandra and Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC 3) imaging of these four systems. We critically examine and confirm the binary-AGN scenario {{for two of the}} four targets, by combining high angular resolution X-ray imaging spectroscopy with Chandra ACIS-S, better nuclear position constraints from WFC 3 F 105 W imaging, and direct starburst estimates from WFC 3 F 336 W imaging; for the other two targets, the existing data are still consistent with the binary-AGN scenario, but we cannot rule out the possibility of only one AGN ionizing gas in both merging galaxies. We find tentative evidence for a systematically smaller X-ray-to-[O III] luminosity ratio and/or higher Compton-thick fraction in optically selected kpc-scale binary AGNs than in single AGNs, possibly caused by a higher <b>nuclear</b> gas <b>column</b> due to mergers and/or a viewing angle bias related to the double-peak narrow line selection. While our result lends some further support to the general approach of optically identifying kpc-scale binary AGNs, it also highlights the challenge and ambiguity of X-ray confirmation.

Flattening below a rest frame energy of 5 keV can be accounted for by absorption from an equivalent column density of (cold) gas with N_H ~ 8 x 10 ^ 22 cm^- 2. Below 2 keV a (variable) excess of a factor ~ 20 above the extrapolated absorbed spectrum is also detected. These findings are consistent with and extend to higher redshifts the correlation between increasing soft X-ray flattening and increasing z, previously pointed out for large samples of radio-loud quasars.

HEM varieties were shown to produce less than one-third of canolol compared to rapeseed at similar roasting conditions. This observation was linked to a lower free sinapic acid content together with a lower loss of sinapic acid derivatives in the HEM varieties compared to rapeseed. Around 50 % of the canolol formed in the roasted seed was shown to be extracted in the oil.

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{dealt with the}} {{increasing}} occurrence of emerging pollutants (e. g. hormones, pharmaceuticals) that trigger adverse effects in river systems. Thus, strategies for their identification are needed. Effect directed analysis (EDA) approach aims at identifying such adverse chemicals. Its current use is the most often restricted to dioxin (AhR), estrogen (ER) or androgen (AR) receptors pathways while recent evidences suggested that others signalling pathways (e. g. PXR) involved in endocrine regulation can be disrupted. Hence identifying environmental active pollutants on these other pathways will enhance risk knowledge on endocrine disruption in situ. We report here {{the use of a}} battery of in vitro reporter gene bioassays including classical and emerging pathways to characterize the contamination of both sediment and surface water (polar organic integrative sampler (POCIS) and semi permeable membrane device (SPMD)). This allowed to integrate a wide range of active chemicals and to assess their distribution between river compartments. To isolate and identify these chemicals, a two-step fractionation was then used. This overall approach was applied to a river site under mixed anthropogenic pressure where fish are impacted. The bioassay profiling revealed estrogenic, anti-androgenic, dioxin-like and PXR-like activities in sediment while very strong estrogenic and PXR-like activities were measured in POCIS as regard to what reported scientific litterature. Bioanalysis of SPMD extracts is under progress. A first fractionation of sediment extract led to 4 fractions. F 3 (polar) exerted only strong estrogenic and PXR-like activity while dioxin-like was mainly detected in F 1 and F 2. This demonstrated the occurrence of semi-polar to polar ligands of ER and PXR in sediments. Then F 3 was hyperfractionated, estrogenic activity was mainly detected at the same elution time as BPA and 17 beta-E 2 while PXR-like activity was mainly detected in less polar fractions. In summary, this study demonstrates the usefullness of an EDA approach based on a multireceptors/ muti-compartment approach to assess and identify a diversity of EDCs and to study their distribution between water compartment The active fractions will be investigated using accurate mass spectrometric techniques while further fractionation strategies will be adressed on POCIS extracts.

These data show both broad (FWHM = 231 ± 21 km s- 1) and narrow (FWHM 104 cm- 3 and total column density in the range 1023 - 1024 cm- 2. Models in which the H i absorption is primarily from an atomic or a molecular gas phase can both fit our data. Modelling {{taking into account the}} effective beam shows that the broad H i absorbing gas component does not cover the radio core in Cygnus A and therefore does not contribute to the gas column that blocks our view of the hidden quasar nucleus.

The second narrow H i absorption component is significantly redshifted (by 186 km s- 1) with respect to the systemic velocity and probably traces infalling gas which will ultimately fuel the source.

40|$|We report {{results from}} multi-epoch (2006 - 2013) X-ray {{observations}} of the polar-scattered Seyfert 1 galaxy ESO 323 -G 77. The source exhibits remarkable spectral variability from months to years timescales. The observed spectral variability is entirely due to variations of the column density of a neutral absorber towards the intrinsic <b>nuclear</b> continuum. The <b>column</b> density is generally Compton-thin ranging from a few times 10 (22) cm(- 2) to a few times 10 (23) cm(- 2). However, one observation reveals a Compton-thick state with column density {{of the order of}} 1. 5 x 10 (24) cm(- 2). The observed variability offers a rare opportunity to study the properties of the X-ray absorber(s) in an active galaxy. We identify variable X-ray absorption from two different components, namely (i) a clumpy torus whose individual clumps have a density of <= 1. 7 x 10 (8) cm(- 3) and an average column density of similar to 4 x 10 (22) cm(- 2), and (ii) the broad-line region (BLR), comprising individual clouds with density of 0. 1 - 8 x 10 (9) cm(- 3) and column density of 10 (23) - 10 (24) cm(- 2). The derived properties of the clumpy torus {{can also be used to}} estimate the torus half-opening angle, which is of the order of 47 degrees. We also confirm the previously reported detection of two highly ionized warm absorbers with outflow velocities of 1000 - 4000 km s(- 1). The observed outflow velocities are consistent with the Keplerian/escape velocity at the BLR. Hence, the warm absorbers may be tentatively identified with the warm/hot intercloud medium which ensures that the BLR clouds are in pressure equilibrium with their surroundings. The BLR line-emitting clouds may well be the cold, dense clumps of this outflow, whose warm/hot phase is likely more homogeneous, as suggested by the lack of strong variability of the warm absorber(s) properties during our monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Liquid films falling {{under the}} {{influence}} of gravity are widely encountered in a variety of industrial two-phase flow applications (distillation <b>columns,</b> <b>nuclear</b> reactor cores, wetted walls and packed towers, heat pipes, vertical condensers etc.). The falling annular film represents a fundamental limiting case of the annular flow regime of two-phase gas-liquid flows. The maximum flow rates of gas and liquid phases which flow in opposite-directions (counter-current flow) are limited by a phenomenon known as a Counter-Current Flow Limitation (CCFL or flooding). In other words, flooding phenomenon is defined as the transition of part of liquid to a climbing film on increasing gas velocity. The calculation of pressure drop in nuclear fuel bundles across its different components is very complex and is not discussed vastly in the literature. In general, spacers of various configurations like wire wrapped, honey comb, grid type are used in the fuel rod bundles to provide support to the fuel pins as well as facilitates in effective cooling of the fuel pins, but the pressure drop across it is appreciable. This dissertation investigates the film thickness model in gas liquid two phase annular flow as well as pressure drop estimation in annular geometry such as fuel bundles and spacers. A mathematical model for the estimation of film thickness has been derived by the application of fundamental momentum equation and a numerical iterative technique with programming in MatLab has been adopted to estimate the film thickness in free falling film, a limiting case of gas liquid annular flow. An experimental test facility has been proposed to study and visualize the gas liquid interactions, flooding phenomenon and measurement of film thickness. Spacer loss coefficient and subsequently, pressure drop in D 5 fuel cluster have been estimated with the help of developed correlations based on flow area ratio. As this flow area ratio increases the spacer loss coefficient decrease & vice-versa for a given length of the spacer, but it increases with increase in the spacer length. Pressure drop across spacer is noticeable and amounts to an appreciable percentage of the total pressure drop in the fuel cluster. ...|$|R
40|$|Liquid films falling {{under the}} {{influence}} of gravity are widely encountered in a variety of industrial two-phase flow applications (distillation <b>columns,</b> <b>nuclear</b> reactor cores, etc.). In addition, the falling annular film represents a fundamental limiting case of the annular flow regime of two-phase gas-liquid flows. The literature on annular falling films is dominated by studies concerning the average film thickness. Information on more detailed characteristics of the film thickness variations and information on the velocity profile within the film and wall shear stress are much less common. The statistical description of the film thickness is {{complicated by the fact that}} practically all flows of interest occur in the turbulent regime. Due to the complex and unsteady nature of the turbulent annular falling film, no complete theories or models have yet been developed on the subject. Experimental studies are needed to gain insight into the basic mechanisms that govern this complex flow. The primary purpose of this thesis research was to characterise the film thickness of falling annular films at high and very high Reynolds numbers using non-intrusive imaging techniques. Another objective was to develop ray-tracing techniques to reduce optical distortion and obtain high-quality experimental data. Instantaneous film thickness measurements of falling annular films were extracted at five different Reynolds numbers in the range Re = 1000 ~ 6000 for the fully developed turbulent regime using an automated optical measurement technique. From visual observation of the images obtained it was found that waves were not axisymmetric, i. e., there was substantial azimuthal variation in film thickness. The turbulent waves appeared to be similar in appearance to very large breaking ocean waves driven by strong winds. The random nature of these falling annular films was subjected to statistical analysis. Statistical characteristics of film thickness were studied at Reynolds numbers in the range Re = 1000 ~ 6000. A correlation for dimensionless mean film thickness was obtained in the turbulent flow regime. The dimensionless mean film thickness obtained here was found to be in reasonable agreement with the other established experimental and theoretical studies. It was shown that the Reynolds number influences the statistical characteristics of film thickness such as standard deviation and coefficient of variation. The additional data obtained here shows that the standard deviation continues to increase in proportion to the mean film thickness in the turbulent regime. In other words, in the lower turbulent zones the films are thin and less wavy, whereas in the higher turbulent zones the films are thicker and extremely wavy in nature. The probability density distributions were also obtained. It was found that the measured probability density distributions were asymmetric. They all had a maximum peak and were skewed to the right hand side with a long tail that stretched to over six times the peak value. The maximum peak could be considered to represent the modal value of the film thickness or the substrate film thickness. The increase in skewness and the decrease in the height of the peak with liquid Reynolds number could be attributed to the presence of large disturbance waves which ride on the substrate film. This enhances the waviness of the film. A common problem in imaging flows in cylindrical tubes is the optical distortion caused by the wall curvature. To minimize this problem the cylindrical tube was surrounded by an optical correction box with flat walls filled with water. In addition, an advanced ray tracing model was employed to reduce optical distortion effects in the cylindrical tube. This technique increased the accuracy of the imaging technique and enabled quantitative measurements of film thickness to be made...|$|R

Indeed, detailed studies of luminous water masers, typically associated with the nuclear activity, allow us to investigate the innermost regions of AGN, with {{an impact on the}} still debated Unified Model for this class of objects. We have recently entertained a search for maser emission in a well-defined sample of Compton-thick AGN aimed at investigating, on firm statistical bases, the aforementioned relationship. While the survey is still ongoing, and is matter of a forthcoming publication, a new luminous water maser has been detected in the lenticular (field) S 0 galaxy IRAS 15480 - 0344, whose origin, associated with an accretion disc or a nuclear outflow/jet, needs to be assessed. Multi-epoch single-dish observations and VLBI measurements were performed to investigate the distribution, spatial extension, and variability of the maser emission in order to infer the main characteristics of the water megamaser. The new detection in IRAS 15480 - 0344 is reported: a megamaser with a total single-dish isotropic luminosity of ~ 200 Lsun and a profile composed of two main features, a broad line with a full width to half maximum (FWHM) linewidth of ~ 90 km/s and a narrow (FWHM< 1 km/s) one. We performed a follow-up to the detection with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and confidently detected only the narrow component, which is coincident with the nuclear radio continuum emission detected with the Very Large Array at 8. 4 GHz. A weak narrow feature has also been detected in the velocity range of the broad feature and is located 15 pc to the north-west with respect to the stronger component. Neither maser spot is associated with the compact radio continuum sources derived from the same VLBA dataset. [Abridged]Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|E

However, members of this mosquito complex do not act as natural vectors for Brugian LF caused by Brugia malayi, or for the cat parasite B. pahangi, despite their presence in South Asia where these parasites are endemic. Previous work with the Iowa strain of Culex pipiens pipiens demonstrates that it is equally susceptible to W. bancrofti as is the natural Cx. p. pipiens vector in the Nile Delta, however it is refractory to infection with Brugia spp. Here we report that the infectivity barrier for Brugia spp. in Cx. p. pipiens is the mosquito midgut, which inflicts internal and lethal damage to ingested microfilariae. Following per os Brugia exposures, the prevalence of infection is significantly lower in Cx. p. pipiens compared to susceptible mosquito controls, and differs between parasite species with < 50 % and < 5 % of Cx. p. pipiens becoming infected with B. pahangi and B. malayi, respectively. When Brugia spp. mf were inoculated intrathoracically to bypass the midgut, larvae developed equally well as in controls, indicating that, beyond the midgut, Cx. p. pipiens is physiologically compatible with Brugia spp. Mf isolated from Cx. p. pipiens midguts exhibited compromised motility, and unlike mf derived from blood or isolated from the midguts of Ae. aegypti, failed to develop when inoculated intrathoracically into susceptible mosquitoes. Together these data strongly support {{the role of the}} midgut as the primary infection barrier for Brugia spp. in Cx. p. pipiens.

40|$|The nucleus tractus solitarius, a <b>nuclear</b> <b>column</b> in the medulla oblongata, {{plays an}} {{important}} role in cardiovascular regulation. In particular, the subnuclei nucleus commissuralis (NC) and nucleus medialis (NM) have been implicated to be the sites of this regulation. The ontogeny of the metabolic requirements in these subnuclei studied in the postnatal Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY) using the ³H- 2 -deoxy-o-glucose (³H- 2 DG) autoradiography technique. The metabolic development of the same subnuclei was then studied in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) in which a state of elevated blood pressure is genetically triggered to determine if the metabolic requirements within the NC and NM are altered during the development of hypertension. [...] It was found that the metabolic requirements in the NC and NM of the WKY were not constant between 2 and 12 weeks of age. A high level of metabolic activity at 2 and 8 weeks was contrasted by a lower level at 4 and 12 weeks. The same trends of metabolic requirements found in the normotensive rats were found in the SHRs; however, the relative metabolic activity in the NC of 2 and 4 week SHRs was significantly higher than in the normotensive rat. [...] To extend the developmental studies and to examine the possibility that structural differences in the NC and NM between the two strains were responsible for the differences observed in the metabolic requirements in the NC of young hypertensive rats, the exchange vessel densities and neuronal densities in the two subnuclei were quantitated. [...] No differences in exchange vessel densities were found in the NC and NM between 4 - and 12 -week-old rats, between the NC and NM at either age, or between WKYs and SHRs. [...] Neuronal densities in the NM were generally higher than in the NC of both WKYs and SHRs. Densities in the two subnuclei of WKYs decreased linearly as the rats matured. In the SHRs as compared to the WKYs, the densities of neurons were significantly higher in the NM and NC, beg inning at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. [...] Therefore it has been found that the metabolic activity in the NC and NM of WKYs and SHRs is not constant between 2 and 12 weeks of age. Significantly higher energy requirements were found in the NC of prehypertensive SHRs which were not related to differences in exchange vessel or neuronal densities...|$|E
