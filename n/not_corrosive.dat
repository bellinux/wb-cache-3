However, in Mayberry’s eyes a modern platonically inspired doctrine that holds that say, proper classes, objectively exist is as much a departure from good sense and probable truthfulness as, say, the early 19th century formalistically inspired doctrine, Peacock’s “Principle of the equivalence of Permanent Forms”.|$|E
5000|$|Monosodium methyl arsenate (MSMA) is an arsenic-based herbicide. It is an organo-arsenate; less toxic {{than the}} {{inorganic}} form of arsenates. It {{is one of}} the most common and cost effective herbicides used against weeds in agriculture. MSMA products are unique in that they combine selectivity, low weed-resistance, and cost-efficiency.MSMA is an herbicide used to control a wide spectrum of hard to control grass and broad-leaf weeds including some weeds that are resistant to the herbicide Glyphosate.MSMA products are effective, cost efficient and selective. Weed-resistance to herbicides is on the rise due to both the repeated use of the herbicides and the introduction of genetically modified crops. These crops are endowed with natural resistance to certain herbicides, a resistance which they may impart to non-crops through cross pollination. There are very few, if any, new herbicides capable of economically combating the resistance problem. With the exception of isolated cases of common cocklebur Xanthium strumarium, no resistance build-up has occurred with the weeds that MSMA controls.MSMA provide post-emergent selective annual grass and yellow nutsedge control, in cool season [...] MSMA is an effective treatment to control Convolvulaceae (morning glory) and Cyperus rotundus (nutgrass).

The upper boundary was measured when the coupling potential of the MAS probe was raised to a value at which all electrodes are likely to be anodic. Under such raised coupling potential, possible internal electron flows within the most anodic electrode were stopped and their effects on the measured corrosion rate were eliminated...|$|R

30|$|The TEM {{image of}} the as-received SWCNTs shows that there are large {{portions}} of carbonaceous and metallic impurities (Fig. 1 c). On the other hand, the PPA treated SWCNTs show that most of carbonaceous impurities have been removed, but some entrapped metallic particles are still present in stable spherical crystalline phases (Fig. 1 d, arrows). Since PPA is <b>not</b> as <b>corrosive</b> as superacids, the entrapped metallic particles could not be removed without causing the sidewall opening and breaking of the stable crystalline carbon particles. This implies that PPA can selectively destroy the amorphous carbons. Unlike SWCNTs treated in hydrochloric acid and nitric acid/sulfuric acid treatments [20 – 22], there were no broken SWCNTs in bundles observed in this study. On {{the basis of these}} observations, PPA is indeed a mild and much less destructive medium for the purification of commercial grade SWCNTs and thus, SWCNTs could preserve their structural integrity.|$|R

Available data and practical experience indicated that these substances are corrosive to the skin. The substances tested are cationic surfactants which dermal effects are characterized by a delayed severe inflammatory reaction. The mechanism is thought to be related to disruption of the cellular membrane following diffusion of the long apolar tails of the molecules into the lipid bilayers. However, unexpectedly almost all obtained study results indicated that these substances are <b>NOT</b> <b>corrosive</b> in these in vitro RhE test systems. Since these results did not align with the experiences on such substances, limited in vivo rabbit studies were employed additionally.
