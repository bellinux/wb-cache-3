50|$|LTP can {{be thought}} of as the {{prolonged}} strengthening of synaptic transmission, and is known to produce increases in the neurotransmitter production and receptor sensitivity, lasting minutes to even days. The process of LTP is regarded as a contributing factor to synaptic plasticity and in the growth of synaptic strength, which are suggested to underlie memory formation. LTP is also considered to be an important mechanism in terms of maintaining memories within brain regions, and therefore is thought to be involved in learning. There is compelling evidence that LTP is critical for Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats suggesting that it mediates learning and memory in mammals. Specifically, <b>NMDA-receptor</b> antagonists appear to block the induction of both LTP and fear conditioning and that fear conditioning increases amygdaloidal synaptic transmission that would result in LTP.|$|E
50|$|Detecting visual contours, edges, or {{boundaries}} is {{an important}} function in human and computer vision which facilitates figure-ground segmentation and object recognition. Contour integration depends on a subject’s ability to link representations of separate visual stimuli into a coherent percept.

In these experiments, subjects often viewed stimuli that could be connected to form a coherent perception of a line, like a simplified connect the dots puzzle. It is worth noting that in general, the magnitude of visual processing abnormalities (such as abnormal contour detection performance) in schizophrenia are fairly small. Therefore, {{it may be necessary to}} examine experimental data from a large number of subjects in order to observe difference between healthy adults and those with schizophrenia using statistical methods.It has been proposed that weaker lateral excitation due to deficient <b>NMDA-receptor</b> functioning could disrupt neural processing, and that this might underlie problems with contour integration in schizophrenia. This idea is consistent with the Glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, as dysfunction in this neurotransmitter system may explain symptoms observed in this disorder.|$|E

Therefore, they are often synonymously referred to as 'ApoE receptors'. ApoE occurs in 3 common isoforms (E2, E3, E4) in the human population. ApoE4 is the primary genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. This strong genetic association {{has led to the}} proposal that ApoE receptors {{play a central role in}} the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease. [...] According to one study, reelin expression and glycosylation patterns are altered in Alzheimer's disease. In the cortex of the patients, reelin levels were 40% higher compared with controls, but the cerebellar levels of the protein remain normal in the same patients. This finding is in agreement with an earlier study showing the presence of Reelin associated with amyloid plaques in a transgenic AD mouse model. A large genetic study of 2008 showed that RELN gene variation is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in women. The number of reelin-producing Cajal-Retzius cells is significantly decreased in the first cortical layer of patients. Reelin has been shown to interact with amyloid precursor protein, and, according to one in-vitro study, is able to counteract the Aβ-induced dampening of <b>NMDA-receptor</b> activity.

PrPC is enriched in post-synaptic densities, and Aβ/PrPC interaction leads to Fyn kinase activation. Soluble Aβ assemblies derived from human AD brain interact with PrPC to activate Fyn. Aβ engagement of PrPC/Fyn signaling yields phosphorylation of the NR 2 B subunit of <b>NMDA-receptors,</b> which is coupled to an initial increase and then loss of surface <b>NMDA-receptors.</b> Aβ-induced LDH release and dendritic spine loss require both PrPC and Fyn, and human familial AD transgene-induced convulsive seizures do not occur in mice lacking PrPC.

Here we show that acute perfusion of hippocampal slice cultures with oligomeric Ab depresses synaptic transmission within 20 minutes.

40|$|The {{present study}} reveals that layer II/III {{pyramidal}} cells, firing {{in a high}} oscillatory regime in the gamma-frequency range (20 Hz and 40 Hz) are able to discriminate between presynaptic cells oscillating in phase and presynaptic cells oscillating out of phase. Synaptic connections between cells oscillating in phase tend to be strengthened, whereas connections between out of phase oscillating cells get depressed. The time windows for this differential synaptic regulation are defined by the precise phase relation of incoming inputs to the oscillatory Vm modulation. The phase angle sensitivity of Hebbian modifications depends on the activation of <b>NMDA-receptors</b> and is dramatically affected by neuromodulation. The activation of cholinergic receptors {{is a prerequisite for}} the bidirectional regulation of synaptic inputs, coincident activity leading to synaptic potentiation and phase-lagged activity to synaptic depression.

A classification scheme for the stability problem is formulated, and it is shown that the two approaches yield the same predictions, except for one notable exception. The narrow pair is generically unstable, while the broad pair is stable for small and moderate values of the relative inhibition time. At a critical relative inhibition time the broad pair is typically converted to stable breathers through a Hopf bifurcation.

40|$|Several {{neurodegenerative}} disorders {{are associated with}} impaired cholesterol homeostasis in the nervous system where cholesterol is known {{to play a role}} in modulating synaptic activity and stabilizing membrane microdomains. In the present report, we investigated the effects of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin-induced cholesterol depletion on synaptic transmission and on the expression of 1) paired-pulse facilitation (PPF); 2) paired-pulse inhibition (PPI) and 3) long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA 1 hippocampal region.
