2500|$|During the 2016 Republican National Convention, Giuliani {{announced}} that Trump had made unspecified [...] "anonymous" [...] donations after the Sep 11 attacks, although such donations {{have not been}} identified. Giuliani also said, in support of Trump's candidacy, [...] "Every time New York City suffered a tragedy Donald Trump was there to help,.... He's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> my telling you this {{but he did it}} anonymously.” ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{because of}} Eiseley's intense and poetic writing style and {{his focus on}} nature and cosmology, he was not {{accepted}} or understood by most of his colleagues. [...] "You," [...] a friend told him, [...] "are a freak, you know. A God-damned freak, and life {{is never going to}} be easy for you. You like scholarship, but the scholars, some of them, anyhow, are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> you because you don’t stay in the hole where God supposedly put you. You keep sticking your head out and looking around. In a university that’s inadvisable." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the topic}} of the sound of the {{comeback}} album, Dane said, [...] "This record is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sound <b>like</b> the other two. It might sound very similar to the second one ('Into The Mirror Black'). It's definitely <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sound <b>like</b> the first one, because we're all a little bit older and I can't come up with a c-clamp for a scrotum and a helium tank [...] [...] [...] It's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sound <b>like</b> the old ones... it's 2011. It's still gonna be that good, I think, and there's gonna be high-pitched screaming. I'm making sure of that. With NEVERMORE, high-pitched screaming was never really called for. You know, with SANCTUARY... of course it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|Harper clenched one hand. “You hear them!” he said. “Well, they’ll {{get their}} answer by and by, and they’re <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> feel <b>like</b> {{shouting}} when we’re through with them.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In Ireland, Midday first {{aired in}} 2008 on TV3. Midday has been {{described}} as an Irish Loose Women but a TV3 representative said [...] "Were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>like</b> Loose Women though, they seem {{to do a lot of}} men bashing and talking about their sex lives, we certainly wont be doing that" ...|$|R
2500|$|For the {{recording}} of their next studio album, the Replacements {{decided to return to}} Blackberry Way Studios in late 1983. The band considered R.E.M.'s guitarist Peter Buck as producer, but when they met him in Athens, Georgia, they did not have enough material to begin recording. Instead, Jesperson and Steve Fjelstad co-produced the album. By this time, the Replacements had grown tired of playing loud and fast exclusively; Westerberg stated, [...] "Now we're softening a little where we can do something that's a little more sincere without being afraid that someone's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> it or the punks aren't {{going to be able to}} dance to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Over 131 years, 404 {{men have}} been accorded to the honour of wearing the baggy green cap, arguably the most {{significant}} and recognizable symbol in Australian team sport," [...] wrote Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) Glenn Mitchell. [...] "Many today would have hung their head in sadness while others would have turned and in their grave. What happened today in Nagpur was at odds with team sport is all about. May it never be allowed to happen again." [...] The barrage of Ponting's decision continued, with then Australian leading Test run-scorer (since overtaken by Ponting) saying on Fox Sports, [...] "I don't {{know what to make}} of this. They go into the tea break on a high and come out worrying about over-rates. I am glad Ricky can't read my mind right now because he is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> it." [...] Ponting later admitted that Border's comment was the one that hurt him the most, despite News Limited reporter Jon Pierik describing his captaincy as a [...] "joke", while Malcolm Conn from The Australian wrote it was his [...] "worst day as national captain". Indian newspapers also continued with the criticism, with some suggesting Ponting put himself before the team. Ponting angrily responded to such comments at the post-Test media conference.|$|E

5000|$|According to The Boot, Aldean's {{publicist}} teased {{about the}} song, suggesting Aldean listened to [...] "a little Snoop Dogg in his time"; regarding the song, Aldean {{said he did}} not consider [...] "Dirt Road Anthem" [...] a rap song. He continued by saying, [...] "...if I was <b>to</b> do anything <b>like</b> that, it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>like</b> Kanye West-style or anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope, my dear, you are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>like</b> your mother," [...] said Mr. Burke, gently. [...] "My poor cousin Nora {{was subject}} to a strange lapse of memory at times," [...] he remarked to Louise. [...] "She always {{recovered}} in time, but for days she could remember nothing of her former life--not even her own name. Are you ever affected that way Eliza?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hide you, <b>like</b> that good-for-nothing, finicky, sneery gentleman. You {{shall be}} my pride and my chum. Isn't {{that better than}} rotting on an island for the {{pleasure}} of a gentleman, till he gives you the chuck?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Lucy {{was rather}} alarmed; she thought Stephen and Maggie were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> each other. She had always feared lest Maggie should appear {{too old and}} clever to please that {{critical}} gentleman. [...] "Why, dear Maggie," [...] she interposed, [...] "you have always pretended that you are too fond of being admired; and now, I think, you are angry because some one ventures to admire you." ...|$|E
60|$|And it did, at {{one in the}} afternoon, after I {{had been}} {{compelled}} to wait and freeze for four mortal hours. During this time I fully {{made up my mind}} that I was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> this Captain West. Although I had never met him, his treatment of me from the outset had been, to say the least, cavalier. When the Elsinore lay in Erie Basin, just arrived from California with a cargo of barley, I had crossed over from New York to inspect what was to be my home for many months. I had been delighted with the ship and the cabin accommodation. Even the stateroom selected for me was satisfactory and far more spacious than I had expected. But when I peeped into the captain's room I was amazed at its comfort. When I say that it opened directly into a bath-room, and that, among other things, it was furnished with a big brass bed such as one would never suspect to find at sea, I have said enough.|$|E
5000|$|Srijana Mitra Das of The Times of India gave 2.5 out 5 {{and said}} [...] " [...] It has rather modest {{production}} values but some great lines. It retains the traditional love-story (to its detriment) but goes {{out on a}} limb satirizing the political. It's commenting on what's currently happening but in ways <b>not</b> everyone's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like.</b> It's a cheeky little film - but you may find the laughter a challenge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is nearly}} five hundred ounces to the ton," [...] Harry said, [...] "but {{of course it}} is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> run <b>like</b> that. I reckon it is a rich pocket; there may be a ton of the stuff, and there may be fifty. Now let's go up and have a quiet look for the lode, {{and see if we can}} trace it. We ought to see it on the rock the other side." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to the repression, the St. Augustine movement practiced armed self-defense in addition to nonviolent direct action. In June 1963, Dr. Hayling publicly stated that [...] "I and the others have armed. We will shoot first and answer questions later. We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die <b>like</b> Medgar Evers." [...] The comment made national headlines. When Klan nightriders terrorized black neighborhoods in St. Augustine, Hayling's NAACP members often drove them off with gunfire, and in October, a Klansman was killed.|$|R

50|$|During an {{interview}} with Ed Tech magazine he told this anecdote. I remember Annabelle, who came into my class her freshman year and appeared to {{just want to get}} by. School {{did not seem to be}} a priority for her, and I remember saying to myself, “Annabelle is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> this class.” I said this because the Flipped-Mastery course really expects all students to deeply learn and not just try and get by. As the year started, Annabelle was frustrated because she constantly took shortcuts to learning.|$|E
60|$|CRAVEN. Silence, Charteris. (To Julia, unanswerably.) The {{test of a}} man or woman's {{breeding}} is {{how they}} behave in a quarrel.

But if you are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> behave <b>like</b> a lady when Mrs. Tranfield comes into this room, you've got <b>to</b> behave <b>like</b> a gentleman; or fond as I am of you, I'll cut you dead exactly as I would if you were my son.|$|R
500|$|For the {{performance}} of [...] "Paparazzi", Gaga had collaborated with her Haus of Gaga creative partner Matthew [...] "Matty Dada" [...] Williams. She had a different vision {{for it in the}} beginning. Dada thought that Gaga should wear her hair braided, which Gaga had never done before. Dada's explanation for the concept was the look of Rapunzel, the fairy-tale character. He felt that [...] "it's something people deeply understand. And when you're wearing sunglasses on a scaffolding piece with a giant alien dancing behind you, I promised [...] it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> look <b>like</b> Rapunzel.'" ...|$|R

To operate this you simply pull the gun up as high as possible, where it locks into the fitting, then you step out of the nacelle and stand with a foot on each side. From this position, you have nothing to worry about except being blown out of the ship or being tossed out if the pilot makes a wrong move. This gun, I know, I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> very much.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{faithfulness}} {{to the original}} NES title, producer Robb Alvey explained [...] "(it's about) the original spirit {{of the game and}} creating something for this generation of gamers.
