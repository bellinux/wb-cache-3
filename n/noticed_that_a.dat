5|$|Most {{traditional}} {{or historical}} first-aid treatments for redback spider bites are either useless or dangerous. These include making incisions and promoting bleeding, using ligatures, applying alkaline solutions, providing warmth, and sucking the venom out. In modern first aid, incising, sucking, applying bandages and tourniqueting are strongly discouraged. In 1893, the Camperdown Chronicle {{reported that a}} doctor <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> severely ill benumbed victim got much better overnight following treatment using injections of strychnine and cocaine; strychnine had been popular as a snake bite antidote, {{but it was not}} effective. As of 2011, administration of magnesium sulphate was reported to have had some benefit though evidence of effectiveness is weak.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Planck, Einstein {{entertained the}} {{possibility}} that there might be actual physical quanta of light—what we now call photons. He <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the ultraviolet catastrophe, and the photoelectric effect. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E
5|$|Midshipman David Casey was an {{experienced}} junior {{officer who had}} distinguished himself to Captain Pigot during the previous months, but his disrating {{was one of the}} primary triggers to the mutiny. About a week before the mutiny, Casey was at his station on the main top, and the captain <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> gasket, one of the ties that held the sail securely, had not been tied by one of the sailors under his supervision. Casey was brought before the captain, and apologised for the oversight and took responsibility for it. The captain demanded that Casey apologise on his knees, a completely unacceptable and debasing demand for a gentleman. Casey refused to be humiliated in such a way. Pigot offered him one more opportunity and when Casey once more refused, the captain ordered that Casey receive 12 lashes (more commonly a sailor's punishment than that of a junior officer), and he was disrated, which would effectively end his career as a naval officer. Casey was a popular officer amongst the crew and they felt that he was punished unfairly. The topmen began to plot mutiny.|$|E

25|$|During the 16th century, Western European {{scholars}} – both Catholic and Protestant – {{sought to}} recover the most correct Greek text of the New Testament, {{rather than relying on}} the Vulgate Latin translation. At this time, it was <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> number of early manuscripts containing John's Gospel lacked John 7:53–8:11 inclusive; and also that some manuscripts containing the verses marked them with critical signs, usually a lemniscus or asterisk. It was also noted that, in the lectionary of the Greek church, the Gospel-reading for Pentecost runs from John 7:37 to 8:12, but skips over the twelve verses of this pericope.|$|E

David Bolinsky, creator of the video, wrote that Dembski was warned about using the video without permission.|$|E
25|$|With all {{survivors}} {{floating on}} the water with no life vests, co-pilot Carlton suddenly <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Mrs Thorburn was hanging on to a raft still in its case. Fearing the bright yellow rubber raft might {{attract the attention of}} PLAAF fighters, it took Carlton twenty minutes to finally inflate the rubber dinghy and lift all nine passengers in. Once all were on the dinghy, concern remained that the attacking planes might return; some of the dazed, injured passengers, with their clothes in shreds, hid under a plastic sunshade covering the edges of the dinghy. Although Blown and passenger Peter Thacher kept watch, the attacking planes never returned.|$|E

25|$|Desalination {{has been}} known to history for millennia as both a concept, and later practice, though in a limited form. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle {{observed}} in his work Meteorology that “salt water, when it turns into vapour, becomes sweet and the vapour does not form salt water again when it condenses,” and also <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> fine wax vessel would hold potable water after being submerged long enough in seawater, having acted as a membrane to filter the salt. There are numerous other examples of experimentation in desalination throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages, but desalination was never feasible on a large scale until the modern era.|$|E
25|$|The MythBusters episode {{also pointed}} out another complication: it would be {{necessary}} to insert the item into one's mouth (for example, eat an onion, rinse with mouthwash, conceal a battery), take the breath test, and then possibly remove the item — all of which would have to be accomplished discreetly enough to avoid alerting the police officers administering the test (who would obviously become very suspicious if they <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> person was inserting items into their mouth prior to taking a breath test). It would likely be very difficult, especially for someone in an intoxicated state, to be able to accomplish such a feat.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the siege}} began, the Thebans fought desperately, fearing for their homes, wives and children. The battle {{went on for}} some time, {{and it was in}} doubt. However, Alexander sent in his {{reserves}} and the situation started to improve. Despite the Theban's valiant struggle, however, Alexander <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> unit of their guard had abandoned one of the gates. It is here that he sent Perdiccas troops to enter and penetrate into the city itself. At this point, realizing that the fight for the city walls was a lost cause, the Thebans retreated and began their final battle within the city itself. It was around this time that Philotas and his garrison broke out of the citadel and began fighting in the battle as well.|$|E

However, the state failed to prosecute erring doctors, {{private and public}} hospitals, and public officials. AFP Medical Center, St. Luke’s Hospital, Philippine Orthopedic Hospital, University of Sto. Tomas Hospital, East Avenue Medical Center, Cardinal Santos Medical Center, Medical City, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, General Santos Doctors Hospital (GSDH) were investigated for health insurance fraud. In Iloilo, eye-doctor claims for 2, 071 operations in 2006 amounting to PHP16 million in professional fees were also investigated. A hospital in Davao City also <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> janitor, not a PhilHealth member, had been lying in bed to claim benefits as a PhilHealth-accredited patient.

25|$|About {{the same}} time, Professor Alice Kober studied Linear B {{and managed to}} {{construct}} grids, linking similar symbols in groups of threes. Kober <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> number of Linear B words had common roots and suffixes. This led her to believe that Linear B represented an inflected language, with nouns changing their endings depending on their case. However, some characters {{in the middle of}} the words seemed to correspond with neither a root nor a suffix. Because this effect was found in other known languages, Kober surmised that the odd characters were bridging syllables, with the beginning of the syllable belonging to the root and the end belonging to the suffix. This was a reasonable assumption, since Linear B had far too many characters to be considered alphabetic and too few to be logographic; therefore, each character should represent a syllable.|$|E
25|$|All four aspects may drive SA processes. Being {{aware of}} the status of {{particular}} objects (cues), one might infer that particular situations are on-going, and frame the objects accordingly. The cues then drive re-framing of situations. Having a particular frame, or pre-conception of a situation, this may drive the perception of objects. E.g. having <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> landing is about to occur, an Air Traffic Controller will usually look for specific objects in the environment and update the awareness of their status. Further, having realized the implications of objects of their status, this drives the process of what to attend to next. E.g. knowing that a vehicle is approaching a runway where a landing is about to take place, an Air Traffic Controller may monitor its progress. Event horizon awareness may also guide SA, e.g. if one plans to stop the car at a gas station, one may look for gas station signs.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} day of killings, in one of the barracks at Poniatowa Jews staged a revolt. To stamp it out the SS {{surrounded}} the building by a tight cordon, and set it on fire. The smoke triggered the arrival at the gate of a fire brigade from the village because gendarmes were not informed. According to witness, more than one structure was burning at the camp. The firemen were ordered by the screaming SS to leave immediately, but inadvertently <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Jew running from the flames was bludgeoned with rifle butts, and thrown back into the burning building. The area was covered with bodies of women. The next morning (4November 1943), mass killings at Poniatowa went on as planned and continued {{for the rest of the}} day. In total, on 3–4 November 1943 some 43,000 male and female prisoners were shot over a long line of fake anti-aircraft trenches. The camps were closed. Commandant Gottlieb Hering then joined fellow SS-men from the Operation Reinhard staff at Risiera di San Sabba in Trieste, Italy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1807, Attentives boats cut out two doggers, from the small port of La Trinité, Martinique. There was an English negro on board one who offered to pilot the British in to take an {{unprotected}} sloop with a cargo of sugar that was lying a few miles to the windward. That night, twelve men in two jolly boats set out to capture the sloop. Adverse tides made for slow going {{and it was only}} at dawn {{that they were able to}} enter the harbour. After one of the boats went in chase of a small craft, Lieutenant Cox, the overall commander of the cutting out party, suddenly <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> guarda costa was anchored between him and the sloop. The garda costas crew lined her sides and fired small arms at the British, but apparently did not fire the two 6-pounder guns that were pointing at their attackers. Cox and his five men nevertheless pushed forward and within minutes captured her. Cox then set sail and was able to rejoin Attentive within two hours. He had had only one man wounded in the attack.|$|E
25|$|Many Anglo-Saxon {{people needed}} to learn Norman French to {{communicate}} with their rulers, {{but it is clear}} that among themselves they kept speaking Old English, which meant that England was in an interesting tri-lingual situation: Anglo-Saxon for the common people, Latin for the Church, and Norman French for the administrators, the nobility, and the law courts. In this time, and due to the cultural shock of the Conquest, Anglo-Saxon began to change very rapidly, and by 1200 or so, it was no longer Anglo-Saxon English, but what scholars call early Middle English. But this language had deep roots in Anglo-Saxon, which was being spoken a lot later than 1066. Research in the early twentieth century, and still continuing today, has shown that a form of Anglo-Saxon was still being spoken, and not merely among uneducated peasants, into the thirteenth century in the West Midlands. This was J.R.R. Tolkien's major scholarly discovery when he studied a group of texts written in early Middle English called the Katherine Group, because they include the Life of St. Katherine (also, the Life of St. Margaret, the Life and the Passion of St. Juliana, Ancrene Wisse, and Hali Meithhad—these last two teaching how to be a good anchoress and arguing for the goodness of virginity). Tolkien <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> subtle distinction preserved in these texts indicated that Old English had continued to be spoken far longer than anyone had supposed. In Old English there is a distinction between two different kinds of verbs.|$|E
