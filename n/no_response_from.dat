5|$|In {{addition}} to the Dartmouth College case (supra), there are other reports of certificates of division that were issued but never decided by the Supreme Court. After the indictment of Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy, for treason, William Wirt Henry reports that a certificate of division was issued on Davis's motion to dismiss the indictment {{on the grounds that}} he owed no allegiance to the United States after the secession of his state. Reportedly, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase sided with Davis, while District Judge John Curtiss Underwood sided with the government. <b>No</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the Supreme Court to that certificate is reported, but Davis's bail was eventually absolved, and he was released.|$|E
5|$|In Chittagong, about 115km (70mi) {{north of}} where Akash moved ashore, surface {{stations}} reported peak winds of 37km/h (23mph) and a pressure of 996.8vhPa. Near its landfall location, Akash produced high tides that flooded coastal areas {{with up to}} 1.5m (5ft) of water, destroying at least 30businesses. The cyclone destroyed 205houses and left an additional 845 damaged. Akash caused moderate crop damage near the coast, including 2ha (4.9acres) of destroyed lands of shrimp farms. Heavy precipitation was reported, with one station reporting a total of 53mm (2.12in); the rainfall caused flooding in inland areas. The heavy rains, caused by outer bands of the cyclone before it made landfall, limited play in Chittagong in the third One Day International cricket match between India and Bangladesh, before the match was abandoned. Strong winds caused power outages throughout Cox's Bazar District, and downed about 200 trees on St. Martin's Island. The cyclone left a total of 10boats unaccounted for, with about 50fishermen missing. In total, three fisherman were confirmed killed, all on St. Martin's Island, with two people left hospitalized. The passage of Cyclone Akash left many people homeless. Initially there was <b>no</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> the government. In all, 14 people were killed by Akash and damages amounted to US$982million.|$|E
5|$|The film {{began its}} {{publicity}} campaign in February2011 {{with the goal}} of releasing the film during the period of the 2011 Tamil Nadu legislative assembly elections to raise support of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Party, led by the film's writer, M. Karunanidhi. Criticism mounted against Karunanidhi for being more involved in his artistic pursuits than in his Chief Ministerial duties as the elections approached. Prior to release, the film also drew criticism from the Kongu Nadu Munnetra Kazhagam (KMK) Party claiming that the film portrayed the traditional deities of the gounder community in a bad light, showing them dancing with semi-nude women. Leading figures from the party wrote to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to ban the film, holding the promotional material used for the movie as evidence. When they received <b>no</b> <b>response</b> <b>from</b> CBFC, a petition was filed at Madras High Court, seeking its ban under Article 226 of the Indian constitution. The petition was dismissed, given that Article 226 can only be used by a court on a body that falls within its jurisdiction.|$|E

Furthermore, lots of patients are precluded from preoperative dentofacial orthopedics due to poor socio-economic environments.

30|$|Segments for {{reasoning}} episodes {{begin with}} a statement concerning a particular topic or concept that conveys useful information for others. The episode was extended when additional statements from the same person or others served to supplement the initial statement. The segment could end in three ways: (1) <b>no</b> <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> others regarding the topic before a new topic is initiated, (2) general agreement among team members, or (3) with a conflicting statement rather than supplementing statement (which begins a “conflict episode”). The reasoning episodes include three categories as observational, calculation, and procedural. The observational category refers to the statements that are inferred from given text, information, or data. The calculation category refers to the statements that include calculation procedures initiated and completed by team members by using given information or data. And the procedural category refers to the statements that indicate propositions about the course of action through reasoning or hypotheses.|$|R
40|$|The {{promoter}} of nrdA gene which is related with DNA synthesis {{was used to}} construct a DNA damage sensitive biosensor. A recombinant bioluminescent E. coli strain, BBTNrdA, harboring a plasmid with the nrdA promoter fused to the luxCDABE operon, was successfully constructed. Its response to various chemicals including genotoxic chemicals substantiates it as a DNA damage biosensor. In characterization, three different classes of toxicants were used: DNA damaging chemicals, oxidative stress chemicals, and phenolics. BBTNrdA only responded strongly to DNA damaging chemicals, such as nalidixic acid (NDA), mitomycin C (MMC), 1 -methyl- 1 -nitroso-N-methylguanidine (MNNG), and 4 -nitroquinoline N-oxide (4 -NQO). In contrast, there were <b>no</b> <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> the oxidative stress chemicals and phenolics, except from hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) which is known to cause DNA damage indirectly. Therefore, {{the results of the}} study demonstrate that BBTNrdA can be used as a DNA damage biosensor...|$|R
