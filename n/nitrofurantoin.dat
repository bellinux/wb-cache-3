5|$|Uncomplicated infections can be {{diagnosed}} and treated based on symptoms alone. Antibiotics taken by mouth such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), <b>nitrofurantoin,</b> or fosfomycin are typically first line. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a fluoroquinolone {{may also be}} used. However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacterial that cause urinary infections has been increasing. The FDA recommends {{against the use of}} fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects. These medications substantially shorten the time to recovery with all being equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually sufficient, whereas <b>nitrofurantoin</b> requires 5–7days. Fosfomycin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy.|$|E
5|$|For {{those with}} {{recurrent}} infections, taking a short course of antibiotics when each infection occurs {{is associated with}} the lowest antibiotic use. A prolonged course of daily antibiotics is also effective. Medications frequently used include <b>nitrofurantoin</b> and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Methenamine is another agent used for this purpose as in the bladder where the acidity is low it produces formaldehyde to which resistance does not develop. Some recommend against prolonged use due to concerns of antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of antibiotics such as <b>nitrofurantoin</b> or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, further diagnostic testing may be needed. Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or <b>nitrofurantoin</b> are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrofurantoin</b> is also {{contraindicated}} in babies {{up to the}} age of one month, as {{they have}} immature enzyme systems in their red blood cells (glutathione instability), so <b>nitrofurantoin</b> must not be used because it can cause haemolytic anaemia. For the same reason, <b>nitrofurantoin</b> should not be given to pregnant women after 38 weeks of pregnancy. <b>Nitrofurantoin</b> is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency because of risk of intravascular hemolysis resulting in anemia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrofurantoin</b> and its {{metabolites}} are excreted {{mainly by}} the kidneys. In renal impairment, the concentration achieved in urine may be subtherapeutic. <b>Nitrofurantoin</b> {{should not be}} used in patients with a creatinine clearance of 60 ml/min or less. However, a retrospective chart review may suggest <b>nitrofurantoin</b> is not contraindicated in this population.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{are said}} to be {{susceptible}} to <b>nitrofurantoin</b> if their minimum inhibitory concentration is 32 /ml or less. The peak blood concentration of <b>nitrofurantoin</b> following an oral dose of <b>nitrofurantoin</b> 100nbsp&mg, is less than 1 μg/ml and may be undetectable. Its bioavailability is about 90% and the urinary excretion is 40% tissue penetration is negligible; the drug is well concentrated in the urine: 75% of the dose is rapidly metabolised by the liver, but 25% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged, reliably achieving levels of 200 μg/ml or more. In studies of dogs, the majority of urinary excretion is through glomerular filtration with some tubular secretion. There is also tubular absorption which is increased with urine acidification. However the activity of <b>nitrofurantoin</b> is also pH dependent and mean inhibitory concentration rises sharply with increased pH above 6. <b>Nitrofurantoin</b> cannot be used to treat infections other than simple cystitis.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{bacterial}} {{antibiotic resistance}} to other commonly used agents, such as fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, {{has led to}} increased interest in using <b>nitrofurantoin.</b> Several trials comparing <b>nitrofurantoin</b> to other commonly used agents have shown this drug results in similar cure rates for uncomplicated UTIs. The efficacy of <b>nitrofurantoin</b> in treating UTIs combined with a low rate of bacterial resistance to this agent makes {{it one of the}} first-line agents for treating uncomplicated UTIs as recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrofurantoin</b> is marketed under {{many names}} in {{countries}} worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{antibiotics}} like rifapentine, rifampicin, rifabutine, isoniazid, <b>nitrofurantoin</b> and, possibly, metronidazole.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{should be}} {{informed}} that <b>nitrofurantoin</b> colours urine brown; this is completely harmless.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrofurantoin</b> {{has been}} {{available}} {{for the treatment of}} lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) since 1953.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of action is unique and complex. The drug works by damaging bacterial DNA, since its reduced form is highly reactive. This is {{made possible by the}} rapid reduction of <b>nitrofurantoin</b> inside the bacterial cell by flavoproteins (nitrofuran reductase) to multiple reactive intermediates that attack ribosomal proteins, DNA, respiration, pyruvate metabolism and other macromolecules within the cell. <b>Nitrofurantoin</b> exerts greater effects on bacterial cells than mammalian cells because bacterial cells activate the drug more rapidly. It is not known which of the actions of <b>nitrofurantoin</b> is primarily responsible for its bactericidal activity. The broad {{mechanism of}} action for this drug likely is responsible for the low development of resistance to its effects, as the drug affects many different processes important to the bacterial cell.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{pulmonary}} reactions {{caused by}} <b>nitrofurantoin</b> include diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or both. This uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting {{the drug and}} is usually related to its total lifetime dose. This reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath. It {{is important to recognize}} <b>nitrofurantoin</b> as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of pulmonary side effects arises as it can be reversible if the drug is stopped early.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the more}} serious but rare side effects of <b>nitrofurantoin</b> have been a cause of concern. These include {{pulmonary}} reactions, hepatotoxicity, and neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrofurantoin</b> is not {{recommended}} {{for the treatment of}} pyelonephritis, prostatitis and intra-abdominal abscess, because of extremely poor tissue penetration and low blood levels.|$|E
25|$|At the {{concentrations}} achieved in urine (>100 μg/ml), <b>nitrofurantoin</b> is a bactericide. It is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms at concentrations less than 32 μg/ml.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrofurantoin</b> and the {{quinolone}} antibiotics {{are mutually}} antagonistic in vitro. It {{is not known}} whether this is of clinical significance, but the combination should be avoided.|$|E
25|$|Neuropathy {{is a rare}} {{side effect}} of taking <b>nitrofurantoin.</b> Patients may {{experience}} numbness and tingling in a stocking-glove pattern, {{which may or may}} not improve upon discontinuation of the drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrofurantoin,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Macrobid among others, is an {{antibiotic}} {{used to treat}} bladder infections. It is not effective for kidney infections. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrofurantoin</b> is {{concentrated}} in the urine, leading to higher and more effective levels in the urinary tract than in other tissues or compartments. With a 100mg oral dose, plasma levels are typically less than 1 µg/ml while in the urine it reaches 200µg/ml.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrofurantoin</b> {{was first}} sold in 1953. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 0.005 and 0.46 USD a dose. In the United States it is about 60 USD for 10 days of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Medications, {{substance}} abuse, {{and environmental}} exposures may all trigger eosinophil dysfunction. Medications such as NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), <b>nitrofurantoin,</b> phenytoin, L-tryptophan, daptomycin and ampicillin and drugs of abuse such as inhaled heroin and cocaine may trigger an allergic response {{which results in}} EP. Chemicals such as sulfites, aluminum silicate, and cigarette smoke can cause EP when inhaled. A New York City firefighter developed EP after inhalation of dust from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.|$|E
25|$|Hepatic reactions, {{including}} hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, {{chronic active hepatitis}}, and hepatic necrosis, occur rarely. The {{onset of}} chronic active hepatitis may be insidious, and patients should be monitored periodically for changes in biochemical tests that would indicate liver injury. These reactions usually occur after exposure to the drug for more than 6 weeks. If signs of liver failure are observed in a patient taking <b>nitrofurantoin,</b> the drug should be discontinued. Re-challenge with the drug {{at a later date}} is not recommended, as the reaction may have a hypersensitivity component and recur when the drug is resumed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrofurantoin</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with decreased renal function (CrCl < 60 ml/min) due to systemic accumulation and subtherapeutic levels reached in the urinary tract. However, a retrospective chart review suggests {{the data for this}} cutoff are slim and a cutoff of CrCl < 40 ml/min would be more appropriate. Many of the severe side effects of this drug are more common in the elderly and those with renal impairment, as this causes the drug to be retained in the body and reach higher systemic levels. Thus, the drug is not recommended for the elderly population according to 2012 AGS Beers criteria.|$|E
25|$|Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} is {{a chronic}} disease {{caused by an}} abnormal immune response against liver cells. The disease {{is thought to have}} a genetic predisposition as it is associated with certain human leukocyte antigens involved in the immune response. As in other autoimmune diseases, circulating auto-antibodies may be present and are helpful in diagnosis. Auto-antibodies found in patients with autoimmune hepatitis include the sensitive but less specific anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA). Other autoantibodies that are less common but more specific to autoimmune hepatitis are the antibodies against liver kidney microsome 1 (LKM1) and soluble liver antigen (SLA). Autoimmune hepatitis can also be triggered by drugs (such as <b>nitrofurantoin,</b> hydralazine, and methyldopa), after liver transplant, or by viruses (such as hepatitis A, Epstein-Barr virus, or measles).|$|E
25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include primaquine, pamaquine, and chloroquine. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as phenazopyridine and acetanilide) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (nalidixic acid, <b>nitrofurantoin,</b> isoniazid, dapsone, and furazolidone). Henna has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E
2500|$|Several trials on {{the safety}} and {{teratogenicity}} of <b>nitrofurantoin</b> in pregnancy have shown mixed results. A retrospective study in 2009 claimed that several birth defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, ophthalmic malformations, cleft lip and cleft palate, and atrial septal defect, were more common in neonates exposed to <b>nitrofurantoin</b> during pregnancy. A meta analysis of four out of twenty-two available studies {{on the safety}} of <b>nitrofurantoin</b> found no increased risk. A case-control study in 1998 found {{an increased risk of}} craniosynostosis after exposure to [...] "nitrosatable" [...] drugs. A more recent 2013 population-based cohort study which used women registered in the Norwegian Prescription Database and linked the subjects to a birth outcomes database, however, found no increased risk of major malformations in neonates born to women who took <b>nitrofurantoin</b> in early pregnancy. Many of the studies showing increased risk of <b>nitrofurantoin</b> had limitations and relied on patients' recall of the antibiotics they took during pregnancy rather than objective data, which may have led to recall bias. Nevertheless, in light of these conflicting data, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends using antibiotics only for appropriate indications and for the shortest effective duration.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pulmonary}} toxicity {{caused by}} <b>nitrofurantoin</b> {{can be categorized}} into acute, subacute, and chronic pulmonary reactions. The acute and subacute reactions {{are thought to be}} due to a hypersensitivity reaction and often resolve when the drug is discontinued. Acute reactions have been estimated to occur in about one in 5000 women who take the drug. These reactions usually develop 3–8 days after the first dose of <b>nitrofurantoin,</b> but may occur from a few hours to a few weeks after starting the drug. Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, chills, cough, pleuritic chest pain, headache, back pain, and epigastric pain. [...] Chest radiograph will often show unilateral or bilateral infiltrates similar to pulmonary edema. Treatment includes discontinuation of the <b>nitrofurantoin,</b> which should result in symptom improvement within 24 hours.|$|E
2500|$|Resistance to <b>nitrofurantoin</b> may be {{chromosomal}} or plasmid-mediated {{and involves}} inhibition of nitrofuran reductase. [...] Acquired resistance in E. coli {{continues to be}} rare.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} side effects with <b>nitrofurantoin</b> are nausea, headache, and flatulence. Less common adverse events (occurring {{in less than}} 1% of those taking the drug) include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Bacterial {{infections are}} usually treated with {{antibiotic}}s. However, the antibiotic sensitivities of different strains of E. coli vary widely. As gram-negative organisms, E. coli {{are resistant to}} many antibiotics that are effective against gram-positive organisms. Antibiotics which {{may be used to}} treat E. coli infection include amoxicillin, as well as other semisynthetic penicillins, many cephalosporins, carbapenems, aztreonam, [...] trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, <b>nitrofurantoin</b> and the aminoglycosides.|$|E
2500|$|While ESBL-producing organisms were {{previously}} associated with hospitals and institutional care, these organisms are now increasingly {{found in the}} community. [...] CTX-M-15-positive E. coli are a cause of community-acquired urinary infections in the UK, and tend to be resistant to all oral β-lactam antibiotics, as well as quinolones and sulfonamides. [...] Treatment options may include <b>nitrofurantoin,</b> fosfomycin, mecillinam and chloramphenicol. [...] In desperation, once-daily ertapenem or gentamicin injections may also be used.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{types of}} drugs can cause liver injury, {{including}} the analgesic paracetamol; antibiotics such as isoniazid, <b>nitrofurantoin,</b> amoxicillin-clavulanate, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; anticonvulsants such as valproate and phenytoin; cholesterol-lowering statins; steroids such as oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids; and highly active anti-retroviral therapy {{used in the}} treatment of HIV/AIDS. Of these, amoxicillin-clavulanate is {{the most common cause of}} drug-induced liver injury, and paracetamol toxicity [...] the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States and Europe.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nitrofurantoin</b> is {{pregnancy}} category B. It {{is one of}} the few drugs {{commonly used}} in pregnancy to treat UTIs. Other drugs used for UTIs in pregnancy include cephalexin, amoxicillin, and pivmecillinam. The drug should not be given to women in late pregnancy due to the potential risk of hemolytic anemia in the newborn, as the newborn has not yet developed the enzymatic pathways necessary for glutathione metabolism and the drug may cause oxidative damage to the red blood cells. [...] Newborns of women given this drug late in pregnancy had a higher risk of developing neonatal jaundice.|$|E
2500|$|Residues {{from the}} {{breakdown}} of nitrofuran veterinary antibiotics, including <b>nitrofurantoin,</b> {{have been found in}} chicken in Vietnam, China, Brazil, and Thailand. The European Union banned the use of nitrofurans in food producing animals by classifying it in ANNEX IV (list of pharmacologically active substances for which no maximum residue limits can be fixed) of the Council Regulation 2377/90. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States has prohibited furaltadone since February 1985 and withdrew the approval for the other nitrofuran drugs (except some topical uses) in January 1992. The topical use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone was prohibited in 2002. Australia prohibited the use of nitrofurans in food production in 1992. Japan did not allocate MRLs for nitrofurans leading to the implementation of a [...] "zero tolerance or no residue standard". In Thailand, the Ministry of Health issued in 2001 Proclamation No. 231 MRL of veterinary drug in food which did not allocate MRL for nitrofurans. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives had already prohibited importation and use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone in animal feed in 1999 which was extended to all nitrofurans in 2002. Several metabolites of nitrofurans, such as furazolidone, furaltadone and nitrofurazone cause cancer or genetic damage in rats.|$|E
