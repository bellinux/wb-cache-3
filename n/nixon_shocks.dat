40|$|In {{the second}} full year of {{operation}} of the international trading model built {{under the auspices of}} Project LINK we encountered {{the first of a series}} of world scale shocks, NEP (President Nixon’s New Economic Policy) with the closing of the gold window, surcharging of automobile imports, and a host of domestic economic restrictions. This phase, known in Japan as <b>Nixon</b> <b>shocks,</b> led to the Smithsonian agreement on exchange rates and later dollar devaluation in 1973. This was only the beginning of a tumultuous period with many other shocks of a comparable magnitude. The specific episodes or scenarios that I shall consider in this paper are the following: (i) <b>Nixon</b> <b>shocks</b> and the Smithsonian agreement (ii) Soviet grain purchases, rising food prices, rising raw material prices (iii) Oil embargo and quadrupling of OPEC price...|$|E

25|$|Between 1968 and 1975, {{a variety}} of pegs to gold were put in place, {{eventually}} culminating in a sudden end, on August 15, 1971, to the convertibility of dollars to gold later dubbed the <b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock.</b> The last peg was $42.22 per ounce before the U.S. dollar was let to freely float on currency markets.|$|R

50|$|Among {{the causes}} were the 1973 oil {{crisis and the}} fall of the Bretton Woods system after the <b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock.</b> The {{emergence}} of newly industrialized countries increased competition in the metal industry, triggering a steel crisis, where industrial core areas in North America and Europe were forced to re-structure.

5000|$|The <b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock</b> {{has been}} widely {{considered}} to be a political success, but an economic mixed bag in bringing on the stagflation of the 1970s and leading to the instability of floating currencies. The dollar plunged by a third during the '70s. According to the World Trade Review's report [...] "The <b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock</b> After Forty Years: The Import Surcharge Revisited", Douglas Irwin reports that for several months, U.S officials could not get other countries to agree to a formal revaluation of their currencies. The German mark appreciated significantly after it was allowed to float in May 1971. Further, the <b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock</b> unleashed enormous speculation against the dollar. It forced Japan’s central bank to intervene significantly in the foreign exchange market to prevent the yen from increasing in value. Within two days August 16-17, 1971, Japan’s central bank had to buy $1.3 billion to support the dollar and keep the yen at the old rate of 360 Yen to the dollar. Japan’s foreign exchange reserves rapidly increased: $2.7 billion (30%) a week later and $4 billion the following week. Still, this large-scale intervention by Japan’s central bank could not prevent the depreciation of US dollar against the yen. France also was willing to allow the dollar to depreciate against the franc, but not allow the franc to appreciate against gold (Page 14 Douglas). Even much later, in 2011, Paul Volcker expressed regret over the abandonment of Bretton Woods: [...] "Nobody's in charge," [...] Volcker said. [...] "The Europeans couldn't live with the uncertainty and made their own currency and now that's in trouble." ...|$|R
50|$|Triffin {{predicted}} that the system {{would not be able}} to maintain both liquidity and confidence, a theory later to be known as the Triffin dilemma. His idea was largely ignored until 1971, when his hypothesis became reality, forcing US President Richard Nixon to halt convertibility of the United States dollar into gold, an initiative known colloquially as the <b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock),</b> which effectively ended the Bretton Woods System.|$|R
2500|$|On 15 August 1971, the United States {{unilaterally}} terminated convertibility of the US {{dollar to}} gold, effectively bringing the Bretton Woods system {{to an end}} and rendering the dollar a fiat currency. This action, referred to as the <b>Nixon</b> <b>shock,</b> [...] created the situation in which the US dollar became a reserve currency used by many states. At the same time, many fixed currencies (such as the pound sterling, for example) also became free-floating.|$|R
50|$|Although {{generally}} regarded as a conservative, President Richard Nixon adopted many liberal positions, especially regarding health care, welfare spending, environmentalism {{and support for the}} arts and humanities. He maintained the high taxes and strong economic regulations of the New Deal era. He intervened aggressively in the economy. In August 1971, he took the nation off the gold standard of the Bretton Woods system and imposed (for a while) price and wage controls (<b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock).</b>|$|R
50|$|The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 made gold clauses unenforceable, {{and changed}} the value of gold from $20.67 to $35 per ounce, thereby devaluing the U.S. dollar, as the dollar was gold-based. This price {{remained}} in effect until August 15, 1971, when President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would no longer convert dollars to gold at a fixed value, thus abandoning {{the gold standard for}} foreign exchange (see <b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock).</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Death of Money is a 1993 book (and {{an article}} {{with the same}} title) by Joel Kurtzman, a former editor of Harvard Business Review. Kurtzman uses the [...] "death of money" [...] {{to refer to a}} change in the {{economic}} nature of money in the United States following Richard Nixon's removal of US dollar from the gold standard (as in the Bretton Woods system), informally referred to as the <b>Nixon</b> <b>shock.</b>|$|R
50|$|The United States {{was eager}} to restore {{positive}} relations with France after de Gaulle's departure from office. New US President Richard Nixon and his top advisor Henry Kissinger admired Pompidou; the politicians were in agreement on most major policy issues. The United States offered to help the French nuclear program. Economic difficulties, however, arose following the <b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock</b> and the 1973-75 recession, particularly {{over the role of}} the American dollar as the medium for world trade.|$|R
50|$|During the <b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock</b> and the 1973 oil crisis, {{economic}} growth {{in the rest of the}} world plummeted but the Soviet hard currency earnings grew as a result of oil exports. Following the crisis, overall economic activity decreased markedly in the Soviet Union, the Western Bloc and Japan, but in the Soviet Union it was much more pronounced. Kotz and Weir argued that ultimately, economic stagnation in the Soviet Union could only have been caused by internal problems rather than external.|$|R
50|$|The US dollar (USD) {{has been}} {{considered}} a strong currency for much of its history. Despite the <b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock</b> of 1971, and the United States' growing fiscal and trade deficits, most of the world's monetary systems have been tied to the US dollar due to the Bretton Woods System and dollarization. Countries have thus been compelled to purchase dollars for their foreign exchange reserves, denominate their commodities in dollars for foreign trade, or even use dollars domestically, thus buoying the currency's value.|$|R
25|$|By observing how the Canadian dollar behaves {{against the}} U.S. dollar, foreign {{exchange}} economists can indirectly observe internal behaviours and {{patterns in the}} U.S. economy {{that could not be}} seen by direct observation. The Canadian dollar fully evolved into a global reserve currency only since the 1970s, when it was floated against all other world currencies. Some economists have attributed the rise of importance of the Canadian dollar to the long-term effects of the <b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock</b> that effectively ended the Bretton Woods system of global finance.|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, Shultz's {{attention}} was increasingly diverted from the domestic economy {{to the international}} arena.

During this period Shultz co-founded the [...] "Library Group," [...] which became the G7. Shultz resigned shortly before Nixon to return to private life.|$|R

50|$|Initially, the Singaporean dollar was pegged to the British pound {{sterling}} {{at a rate}} of S$60 = £7. This peg lasted until the demise of the Sterling Area due to the <b>Nixon</b> <b>Shock</b> in the early 1970s, after which the Singaporean dollar was linked to the US dollar for a short time. As Singapore's economy grew and its trade links diversified to many other countries and regions, Singapore moved towards pegging its currency against a fixed and undisclosed trade-weighted basket of currencies from 1973 to 1985.|$|R
