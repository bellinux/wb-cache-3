40|$|Abstract. The (recent, Bayesian) {{cognitive}} science {{literature on the}} Wason Task (WT) has been modeled largely after the (not-so-recent, Bayesian) philosophy of science literature on the Paradox <b>of</b> <b>Confirmation</b> (POC). In this paper, we apply some insights from more recent Bayesian approaches to the (POC) to analogous models of (WT). This involves, first, retracing {{the history of the}} (POC), and, then, re-examining the (WT) with these historico-philosophical insights in mind. 1. The Paradox <b>of</b> <b>Confirmation</b> Before getting into the recent (Bayesian) {{cognitive science}} literature on the Wason Task, we will re-trace the historical (and philosophical) background of the Paradox <b>of</b> <b>Confirmation.</b> In this section, we will tell a revised and extended version of a story about (the history and philosophy of) The Paradox that that we have (partially) told elsewhere [6, 8, 7].

40|$|Abstract. A Bayesian {{account of}} {{independent}} evidential support is outlined. This account is partly {{inspired by the}} work of C. S. Peirce. I show that a large class of quantitative Bayesian measures <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> satisfy some basic desiderata suggested by Peirce for adequate accounts of independent evidence. I argue that, by considering further natural constraints on a probabilistic account of independent evidence, all but a very small class of Bayesian measures <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> can be ruled out. In closing, another application of my account to the problemof evidential diversity is also discussed. 1 Terminology, Notation & Basic Assumptions The present paper is concerned with the degree <b>of</b> incremental <b>confirmation</b> provided by evidential propositions E for hypotheses under test H, givenbackground evidence K, according to relevance measures <b>of</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> c.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} and {{interprets the}} practice of the sacrament <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> in the context of one Roman Catholic parish in Newfoundland. This sacrament affords a researcher unique opportunities to explore folk-official dynamics in Catholicism. Confirmation often brings the highest official in a diocese, a bishop, into contact with adolescents. As a sacrament <b>of</b> initiation, <b>confirmation</b> draws together persons who are accustomed to "practicing" Catholicism in different ways. [...] Historically, Christian bishops in the Western Rite toured extensive areas to bless previously baptized candidates, anoint them with holy oil, and lay hands upon them. Through these actions, candidates were recognized to have received the Holy Spirit and its gifts, as fully initiated Christians. In 1991, 114 candidates were confirmed at St. Cecilia's, a Roman Catholic parish in the Archdiocese of St. John's. [...] Unlike theology or sacramental history, more common approaches to this topic, this study approaches the meaning <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> from the perspectives of adolescent candidates, their families, and parish leaders. Like recent studies <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> by Scandinavian ethnologists, this investigation draws upon oral accounts <b>of</b> <b>confirmations</b> and other data collected through participant observation and interviewing. References to written sources such as city newspaper accounts, local church histories, and archdiocesan reports help portray the significance <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> in the context of Newfoundland history. Local beliefs and practices are presented and analyzed to critique theological representations of this Roman Catholic sacrament. Special attention is paid to adolescents' conformative and non-conforrnative play at a preparatory retreat, and to the structure and function <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> costume...|$|R
40|$|The {{attempt to}} explicate the {{intuitive}} notions <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> and inductive support {{through use of}} the formal calculus of probability received its canonical formulation in Carnap's The Logical Foundations of Probability. It is {{a central part of}} modern Bayesianism as developed recently, for instance, by Paul Horwich and John Earman. Carnap places much emphasis on the identification <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> with the notion of probabilistic favorable relevance. Notoriously, the notion <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> as probabilistic favorable relevance violates the intuitive transmittability condition that if e confirms h and h' is part of the content of h then e confirms h'. This suggests that, pace Carnap, it cannot capture our intuitive notions <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> and inductive support. Without transmittability <b>confirmation</b> losses much <b>of</b> its intrinsic interest. If e, say a report of past observations, can confirm h, say a law-like generalization, without that confirmation being transmitted to those parts of h dealing with the as yet unobserved, then it is not clear why we should be interested in whether h is confirmed or not. The following paper rehearses these difficulties and then proposes a new probabilistic account <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> that does not violate the transmittability condition...|$|R
