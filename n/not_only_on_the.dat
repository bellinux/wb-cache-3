5|$|International {{emergency}} medicine is a subspecialty of {{emergency medicine}} that focuses <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> global practice of emergency medicine {{but also on}} efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations {{and other aspects of}} prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From this point of view, international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E
5|$|Rodgers {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} a musical comedy about the cast and crew {{backstage}} at a theatre. After Rodgers and Hammerstein had another hit with The King and I in 1951, Rodgers proposed the backstage project to his partner. Hammerstein was unenthusiastic, thinking the subject matter trivial, but agreed to do the project. The play required complex machinery, designed by Jo Mielziner, so that the audience could view action <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage of the theatre where the show-within-the-show (also named Me and Juliet) takes place, but in the wings and on the light bridge (high above the stage, from which the lighting technicians train spotlights) as well.|$|E
5|$|Several hundred frog {{species in}} {{adaptive}} radiations (e.g., Eleutherodactylus, the Pacific Platymantis, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, {{and many other}} tropical frogs), however, do not need any water for breeding in the wild. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the tadpole stage within the egg. Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.|$|E

5|$|Despite their advances, the Bone Wars {{also had}} a {{negative}} impact <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two scientists but also on their peers and the entire field. The public animosity between Cope and Marsh harmed the reputation of American paleontology in Europe for decades. Furthermore, the reported use of dynamite and sabotage by employees of both men may have destroyed or buried hundreds of potentially critical fossil remains. Joseph Leidy abandoned his more methodical excavations in the West, finding he could {{not keep up with}} Cope's and Marsh's reckless searching for bones. Leidy also grew tired of the constant squabbling between the two men, with the result that his withdrawal from the field marginalized his own legacy; after his death, Osborn found not a single mention of the man in either of the rivals' works. In their haste to outdo each other, Cope and Marsh haphazardly assembled the bones of their own discoveries. Their descriptions of new species, based on their reconstructions, led to confusion and misconceptions that lasted for decades after their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental rights {{primarily}} protect {{individuals from}} any arbitrary state actions, but some rights are enforceable against individuals. For instance, the Constitution abolishes untouchability and also prohibits begar. These provisions {{act as a}} check both on state action {{as well as the}} action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of general welfare. They can also be selectively curtailed. The Supreme Court has ruled that all provisions of the Constitution, including fundamental rights can be amended. However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. Since the fundamental rights can be altered only by a constitutional amendment, their inclusion is a check <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> executive branch but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.|$|E

5|$|In a draft {{resolution}} for the IAU definition of planet, both Pluto and Charon {{would have been}} considered dwarf planets in a binary system, given that they both satisfied the mass and shape requirements for dwarf planets and revolved around a common center of mass located between the two bodies (rather than within one of the bodies). The IAU currently states that Charon is not considered to be a dwarf planet and is just a satellite of Pluto, although the idea that Charon might qualify to be a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date. The location of the barycenter depends <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relative masses of the bodies, but also on the distance between them; the barycenter of the SunâJupiter orbit, for example, lies outside the Sun.|$|E

The academy is composed of eleven youth selections, ranging from U7 to U19. Totally, there are over 210 youth players in the system who are trained by professional staff within the club. The vision of the club and its youth system is not only to produce new players but also to prepare young children for the future and life without football. Therefore, each child {{who wants to be a}} member of the academy must also be successful <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> football field, but also in the field of education. The club has also spread the football school activities to primary schools in the city of Maribor and the surrounding area, where around 500 of the youngest footballers train as part of the Children's Football School.|$|E

5|$|Sir Nigel Gresley's {{independent}} {{report on}} the Kand K1classes during the mainline stability trials stated that they were well designed, mechanically reliable and capable of hauling expresses at high speeds on well-maintained track, which meant {{that they could have}} been useful additions to the Southern Railway's suburban commuter fleet. However, they were undoubtedly prone to rough riding and instability, and <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> poorest quality tracks. The restricted water capacity also limited their use outside the Southern Railway's Central section. The impending electrification of the Brighton Main Line, scheduled for 1932 also meant that fewer duties suitable for heavy passenger tank locomotives would be available in the 1930s. The lack of a suitable role for both classes was considered when {{the decision was made to}} rebuild them as U/U1 tender engines following the Sevenoaks disaster. In rebuilt form they continued to operate until the 1960s, and were capable of attaining speeds in excess of 70mph (110km/h) with a greater degree of stability.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} {{appearance}} of each coral colony depends <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> species, {{but also on}} its location, depth, {{the amount of water}} movement and other factors. Many shallow-water corals contain symbiont unicellular organisms known as zooxanthellae within their tissues. These give their colour to the coral which thus may vary in hue depending on what species of symbiont it contains. Stony corals are closely related to sea anemones, and like them are armed with stinging cells known as cnidocytes. Corals reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most species release gametes into the sea where fertilisation takes place, and the planula larvae drift as part of the plankton, but a few species brood their eggs. Asexual reproduction is mostly by fragmentation, when part of a colony becomes detached and reattaches elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse's {{treatment}} of quarterback Doug Williams caused resentment <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team, {{but in the}} entire Bay Area community. Williams led the Buccaneers to the playoffs in three of his five years with the team, and {{was considered to be}} their single most important player. However, he was only paid $120,000 a year, which ranked 42nd among NFL quarterbacks, was less than what some teams' third-string quarterbacks made, and was lower than the salary of Terdell Middleton, a running back who had two total carries in his two years in Tampa Bay. After the 1982 season, Williams asked for a $600,000 contract that would pay him among the league's top quarterbacks. Culverhouse refused to budge from his initial offer of $400,000, which he said would make Williams one of the five highest-paid quarterbacks in the league. Williams' agent disputed this, saying that Culverhouse's offer was substantially less than what several other quarterbacks made. With negotiations at a standstill, the Buccaneers traded the following season's first-round draft pick to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Jack Thompson, a backup quarterback who had been unable to unseat Ken Anderson, as an insurance policy should Williams prove impossible to sign, or have trouble recovering from offseason knee surgery. Williams interpreted this as a sign that the team did not want him, and instead signed a contract with the Oklahoma Outlaws of the United States Football League.|$|E
