The matched finished 2–2 after extra time and as so was decided in a penalty shoot-out; the first in Stockport's history. Stockport went on to lose 3–0 on penalties. The introduction of automatic promotion and relegation between the Football League and the Conference was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sign</b> for Stockport, and in 1986–87 they had just six points from 13 games and faced a real prospect of non-League football, exemplified by being eliminated from the FA Cup by Caernarfon Town. Colin Murphy was brought in for his second spell as manager. Stockport gained 45 points from their final 31 games and survived, although Murphy left shortly {{after the end of}} the season.|$|E
500|$|The duet of [...] "I Gotta Be Me" [...] by Finn and Mike was {{considered}} to be [...] "shockingly adorable" [...] by Berk, who gave it four stars out of five. Slezak was less impressed: [...] "The jazz band arrangement and the Mike-teaches-Finn-some-moves choreography was cute, I guess, but it's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sign</b> that I spent half the number focusing on Mike's matching green t-shirt and shoe laces." [...] He went on to question the song's inclusion—"In an episode about confronting one's greatest teenage insecurities, I wonder if {{there might have been a}} better choice for a solo than the popular football player with the cheerleader girlfriend lamenting his inability to dance"—and ultimately gave the performance a [...] "B−". Futterman also commented on the song's selection, though from a slightly different angle: [...] "In theory it's charming—and there are definitely moments of the 'I can dance/You can't dance' exchange that were enjoyable—but we couldn't ever imagine this song as something Finn would have voluntarily picked." ...|$|E

Puram, New Delhi, Yadav took a keen interest in the sport of cricket and became captain of the school team. He has been criticised by the opposition leaders for becoming Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar despite being a school dropout; <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sign</b> for a state with lowest literacy rate in the country.|$|E
5000|$|The {{current ratio}} is an {{indication}} of a firm's liquidity. Acceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry. [...] In many cases a creditor would consider a high current ratio to be better than a low current ratio, because a high current ratio indicates that the company is more likely to pay the creditor back. Large current ratios are <b>not</b> always <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sign</b> for investors. If the company's current ratio is too high it may indicate that the company is not efficiently using its current assets or its short-term financing facilities.|$|R

In this study, {{the results of}} hysterosalpingograms and laparascopy of all patients were evaluated. The goal of this study was: whether polypoid alterations and endometrial hypertrophy were a cornerstone sign for endometriosis. Among 32 patients who showed endometrial hypertrophy or polypoid hypertrophy only 3 has had endometriosis in laparascopy which were proved by histopathology, while 22 out of 168 with normal hysterosalpingograms revealed endometriosis.

50|$|Total Addressable Market {{shows the}} {{potential}} {{scale of the}} market. Estimating TAM {{is the first step}} for entrepreneurs to start up their business. It is important to estimate TAM objectively instead of exaggerating or underestimating this value with subjective attitudes, as it is vital to allocate a suitable market with potential growing capacity. Investors often tend to look for markets with high TAM values, showing confidence in such markets with great potential to increase demand for their products and services. This is a reasonable deduction, while on the other hand, high value of TAM is <b>not</b> necessarily <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sign,</b> as total available market does not mean the high degree of demand obtained. Some other factors such as competition level in the market, accessibility of resources, etc. would also affect the performance of the company. Hence SAM and SOM are also important indicators to measure if the market is worth investing.|$|R

6000|$|At last, however, {{it seemed}} clear that Cupid {{had found a}} sharper arrow than usual, and that Mr. Freely's heart was pierced. It was the general talk among the young people at Grimworth. But was it really love, and not rather ambition? Miss Fullilove, the timber-merchant's daughter, was quite sure that if she were Miss Penny Palfrey, she would be cautious; it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sign</b> when men looked so much above {{themselves}} for a wife. For it was no less a person than Miss Penelope Palfrey, second daughter of the Mr. Palfrey who farmed his own land, that had attracted Mr. Freely's peculiar regard, and conquered his fastidiousness; and no wonder, for the Ideal, as exhibited in the finest waxwork, was perhaps never so closely approached by the Real as {{in the person of}} the pretty Penelope. Her yellowish flaxen hair did not curl naturally, I admit, but its bright crisp ringlets were such smooth, perfect miniature tubes, that you would have longed to pass your little finger through them, and feel their soft elasticity. She wore them in a crop, for in those days, when society was in a healthier state, young ladies wore crops long after they were twenty, and Penelope was not yet nineteen. Like the waxen ideal, she had round blue eyes, and round nostrils in her little nose, and teeth such as the ideal would be seen to have, if it ever showed them. Altogether, she was a small, round thing, as neat as a pink and white double daisy, and as guileless; for I hope it does not argue guile in a pretty damsel of nineteen, to think that she should like to have a beau and be [...] "engaged," [...] when her elder sister had already been in that position a year and a half. To be sure, there was young Towers always coming to the house; but Penny felt convinced he only came to see her brother, for he never had anything to say to her, and never offered her his arm, and was as awkward and silent as possible.|$|E

50|$|We are {{concerned}} that Goss left, or was eased out, for reasons of greater policy significance. And {{if this is the}} case, Goss's leaving is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sign.</b> Goss is a political conservative and an institutional reformer. He is pro-Bush Doctrine and pro-shaking-up-the-CIA.John Negroponte, so far as we can tell, shares none of these sympathies. Negroponte is therefore more in tune with large swaths of the intelligence community and the State Department. If Negroponte forced Goss out and is allowed to pick Goss's successor—if Goss isn't replaced with a reformer committed to fighting and winning the war on terror, broadly and rightly understood—then Goss's departure will prove to have been a weakening moment in an administration increasingly susceptible to moments of weakness.|$|E

IGN awarded it a score of 7.6 out of 10, stating: [...] "Bloody, elegant combat and an otherworldly vibe make Shadow of the Beast a {{successful}} reboot of the Amiga classic." [...] David Jenkins, writing for Metros GameCentral, described the game as taking the inspiration from the art and concept of the somewhat flawed original and marrying this with influences from modern action games, such as Bayonetta, to create something greater than its own legacy. GameSpot awarded it a more negative review of 5.0 out of 10, saying [...] "For a remake, it's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sign</b> that {{the best part about}} the modern Shadow of the Beast is revisiting the game that inspired it." ...|$|E
