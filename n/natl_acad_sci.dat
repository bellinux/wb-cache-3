Anion channels have several major functions in controlling stomatal closing: (a) They allow release of anions, such as chloride and malate from guard cells, which is needed for stomatal closing. (b) Anion channels are activated by signals that cause stomatal closing, for example by intracellular calcium and ABA. The resulting release of negatively charged anions from guard cells results in an electrical shift of the membrane to more positive voltages (depolarization) at the intracellular surface of the guard cell plasma membrane. This electrical depolarization of guard cells leads to activation of the outward potassium channels {{and the release of}} potassium through these channels. At least two major types of anion channels have been characterized in the plasma membrane: S-type anion channels and R-type anion channels.|$|E

40|$|The Pro-FEIBA study {{reported}} health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) improved following 6 -month of Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA) prophylaxis. This study investigates whether 12 -month of FEIBA prophylaxis improved HRQoL in haemophilia patients with inhibitors. Thirty-six subjects in a 1 -year prospective, randomized, open-label, parallel-design study were randomized to prophylaxis (85 +/- 15 Ukg- 1 every other day) or on-demand treatment. HRQoL was assessed at screening, 6 and 12 -month termination using the EQ- 5 D, Haem-A-QoL, Haemo-QoL and a general pain visual analog scale (VAS). To evaluate changes, paired t-tests and criteria for minimally important differences were applied. Repeated measures regression tested the association between annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and physical HRQoL. At 6 and 12 months, prophylaxis subjects reported clinically meaningful improvement in EQ- 5 D index (mean improvement, 0. 10 and 0. 08, respectively) and both clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in EQ-VAS scores (16. 9 and 15. 7, respectively; P< 0. 05) vs. baseline. General pain was significantly reduced during prophylaxis at each follow-up (mean improvement, 20. 3 and 23. 2, respectively; both P< 0. 05). At 12 months, prophylaxis subjects achieved significant improvements in Haem-A-QoL Total Score and in four domains: Physical Health, Feeling, View, and Work and School (all P< 0. 05). No statistically significant changes, except for Haem-A-QoL Physical Health at 6 months, were observed with on-demand treatment. ABR was decreased by 72. 5 % with prophylaxis vs. on-demand treatment (P= 0. 0003) and reduced ABR was associated with better physical HRQoL (P< 0. 05). FEIBA prophylaxis significantly reduced ABR and improved HRQoL in inhibitor patients. Subjects with lower ABR reported better physical HRQoL.

40|$|Factor {{replacement}} therapy {{for the treatment}} of moderate to severe haemophilia A and B can be complicated by the production of inhibitory alloantibodies to factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX. Treatment with the nanofiltered anti-inhibitor coagulant complex, Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA NF), is a key therapeutic option for controlling acute haemorrhages in patients with high-titre inhibitors or low-titre inhibitors refractory to {{replacement therapy}}. Given the high risk for morbidity and mortality in haemophilia patients with inhibitors to FVIII or FIX, we conducted this Phase 3 prospective study to evaluate whether prophylaxis with FEIBA NF is a safe and effective treatment option. Over a 1 -year period, 17 subjects were treated prophylactically (85 +/- 15 Ukg(- 1) every other day) while 19 subjects were treated on demand. the median (IQR) annualized bleeding rate (ABR) during prophylaxis was 7. 9 (8. 1), compared to 28. 7 (32. 3) during on-demand treatment, which amounts to a 72. 5 % reduction and a statistically significant difference in ABRs between arms (P= 0. 0003). Three (17. 6 %) subjects (ITT) on prophylaxis experienced no bleeding episodes, whereas none treated on demand were bleeding episode-free. Total utilization of FEIBA NF {{for the treatment of}} bleeding episodes was significantly higher during on-demand therapy than prophylaxis (P= 0. 0067). There were no differences in the rates of related adverse events between arms. This study demonstrates that FEIBA prophylaxis significantly reduces all types of bleeding compared with on-demand treatment, and the safety of prophylaxis is comparable to that of on-demand treatment.
