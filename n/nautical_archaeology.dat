Turkish sponge divers were often consulted by the Institute of <b>Nautical</b> <b>Archaeology's</b> (INA) survey team on how to identify ancient wrecks while diving for sponges. Çakir’s findings urged Oğuz Alpözen, Director of the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology, to send out an inspection team of the Museum and INA archaeologists to locate the wreck site. The inspection team was able to locate several amounts of copper ingots just 50 metres from the shore of Uluburun.|$|R

25|$|A 9th-century wreck {{known as}} Tantura B, most likely an Arab trading vessel, was {{discovered}} in shallow water off the Tantura coast.

The Tantura B hull was found resting on top of another shipwreck dating to the Roman period. Excavations at Tel Dor in 1986 unearthed an intact purple dye manufacturing installation, based on dye extracted from murex marine snails.|$|E
25|$|The Institute of <b>Nautical</b> <b>Archaeology</b> (INA) began {{excavating}} in July 1984 {{under the}} direction of its founder, George F. Bass, and was then turned over to INA’s Vice President for Turkey, Cemal Pulak, who directed the excavation from 1985 to 1994. The wreck lay between 44 and 52 meters deep on a steep, rocky slope riddled with sand pockets. Half of the staff members who aided in the excavation lived in a camp built into the southeastern face of the promontory, which the ship most likely hit, while the other half lived aboard the Virazon, INA’s research vessel at the time. The excavation site utilized an underwater telephone booth and air-lifts. The mapping of the site was done by triangulation. Meter tapes and metal squares were used as an orientation aid for excavators. Since the completion of the excavation in September 1994, all efforts have been concentrated on full-time conservation, study, and sampling for analysis in the conservation laboratory of the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology in Turkey.|$|E
25|$|The Phoenician port of Beirut {{was located}} between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby {{on the north}} coast. The port or harbor was {{excavated}} and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city. Another suggested port or dry dock was {{claimed to have been}} discovered ~ to the west, in 2011 by a team of Lebanese archaeologists from the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanese University. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorization was given by Lebanese Minister of Culture Gaby Layoun for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500 million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an expert report by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of <b>Nautical</b> <b>Archaeology</b> and now teaching at Marburg in Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may now never be discovered, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.|$|E

In 1975, a team from the Institute of <b>Nautical</b> crographics. <b>Archaeology</b> excavated a pottery assemblage lying at a depth of approximately 30 meters in the bay of keyman Derek (Devil Creek), on the Aegean coast of Turkey east of Bodrum. Despite the absence of ship timbers, the location of the site, the uniform fabric of most of the items, and their distribution on the seabed indicated that the assemblage represented a shipwreck. The potted, comprising exclusively coarseware utilitarian vessels, may have served as merchandise containers and/or constituted trade items, while some may have held the crew' s food and drink supply. After conservation and preliminary study of the material, project director George Bass dated the wreck to the late Middle Bronze Age pointing to Middle Minoan as well as Amatolian influences on the pottery. While it is true that none of the Bronze Age analogues constitutes an exact parallel of any of the Sextan Deresi ceramics, later periods do not provide any closer counterparts. Recent excavations have brought to light material that supports a Middle Bronze Age dating and strengthens the case for the possibly Minoan or Minonmizing nature of the pottery. Additionally, recent work ill Eastern Aegean islands substantiates the tradition of colonization and intensive maritime activity by Minors in the region. Tile pottery from keyman Deresi may have been made in a Minoan settlement of the Eastern Aegean islands or a site on the Anatolian coast where Minors lived and/or traded...|$|R
25|$|In the 1960s and 70s the Mary Rose Committee {{collaborated with}} museum representatives, diving clubs and archaeologists to {{campaign}} for legal protection of shipwrecks as vital to the national historical heritage. The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 stipulated that any wreck that was unclaimed and was salvaged had {{to be sold to}} pay for the expenses of the salvers. This meant that any shipwreck old enough to fall under the sway of the Act was threatened by commercial exploitation. Instead of being carefully excavated and recorded by maritime archaeologists, historically invaluable wrecks risked being destroyed by unscrupulous salvers and treasure hunters. The joint organisation Committee for <b>Nautical</b> <b>Archaeology,</b> of which the Mary Rose Committee was a member, successfully lobbied to grant the wreck legal protection under the Protection of Wrecks Act of 1973, with the Mary Rose being among the first to receive legal protection. However, the risk of having salvaged artefacts confiscated was still a very real risk under UK salvage law, and a confrontation had to be averted by continuous negotiations with the Receiver of Wreck, a division of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The Mary Rose, along with a few other historic wrecks, was a vital example during the lobbying for the new shipping act as well as the gradual change in implementation of UK salvage law.|$|E
25|$|On 9 September 2007, Australian and Turkish naval {{authorities}} {{began an}} undersea investigation {{to determine if}} AE2 could be raised and restored. Such a plan would see the submarine transferred to a viewing tank at Çanakkale. As part of the inspection, a drop camera was inserted through the submarine's open hatch and into the control room. The survey team discovered that the wreck of AE2 had suffered further damage since the 1998 inspection dives. The bow portion of the external hull casing had been destroyed and {{the rear of the}} conning tower now showed significant damage. Following an April 2008 workshop by the Turkish Institute of <b>Nautical</b> <b>Archaeology</b> and the Submarine Institute of Australia, the recommendation was made against raising the wreck. Moving the submarine to a viewing tank, or alternately relocating the wreck to shallower water, were advised against because of the AU$80–100 million cost of such projects. Moving AE2 would also pose high risk to both the submarine and any vessels involved in the relocation; as well as potentially damaging the wreck, there is still an unexploded torpedo aboard. Instead, the workshop advised that the submarine be preserved through the use of sacrificial anodes to reduce corrosion, along with buoys and a surveillance system to mark the wreck and detect unauthorised access and potential damage.|$|E

40|$|Marine archaeology, {{also known}} as maritime, <b>nautical</b> or {{underwater}} <b>archaeology</b> deals with the 'scientific study of the material remains of man and his past activities on the sea'. Marine archaeol-ogy has made tremendous progress in India. Over the years, the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa, in collaboration with other Government agencies has undertaken the exploration and excava-tion of submerged ports and shipwrecks at Dwarka, Bet Dwarka, Somnath, Vijaydurg, Goa and Lakshadweep on the west coast; and Poompuhar and Mahabalipuram {{on the east coast}} of India. Further, onshore explorations have also been carried out at various places along both coasts of India to locate ports, trading centres and structures related to maritime activities. These findings from various sites in India, confirm her rich submerged cultural heritage, conservation of which is a prime necessity. A modest beginning has been made in this direction and more thrust is required before this submerged heritage is destroyed owing to intense activity along the coast, resulting from globalisation and rapid industrialisation. This article provides an overview of developments in Indian marine archaeology, and describes a few important sites and their archaeological significance.

40|$|This thesis depicts {{aspects of}} {{maritime}} life {{along the coast}} of central Vietnam, Cochinchina, between the 16 th and the 19 th centuries. The aim of the thesis is to provide a general understanding of the traditional use of boats, and in doing so, the thesis examines from several vantage points maritime routes, the characteristics of the South China Sea and its navigation, various maritime activities, Cochinchinese seafaring and seamanship, and finally, the boats themselves. Between the 16 th and the 19 th centuries, maritime activity {{along the coast of}} Cochinchina was bustling. Boats were central {{to the development of the}} region under the reign of the Nguyễn Lords (1558 - 1776) up to the early years of the Nguyễn Dynasty (1802 - 1945), for defence and expansion, for trade, and for sustaining daily life. Concurrently, Europeans in the age of sail followed the traditional maritime route to China that hugged the coast of Cochinchina, and often sailed into its harbours. In this thesis, the maritime aspect is the component that links these various topics together. As such, it uses a framework initiated by the Annales School, and deepened by the New Thalassology. Within that framework, the sea is considered as a fundamental force that shaped life along the coast, and the South China Sea is thus central to this thesis. At the same time, the methodology relies on a multi-disciplinary approach that draws upon a range of sources, in order to address a particular region of Vietnam over the longue durée. The thesis therefore draws upon archival documents, including travellers’ accounts, missionaries’ letters, and embassies’ reports from the French, the Spanish, the Portuguese, the Dutch and the English, to reconstruct a sense of the navigation conditions on the South China Sea, along the coast of central Vietnam, and to shed light on the boats and mariners that sailed there. It also draws upon ethnography, from the 19 th century to the present, to address the continuity of navigation, boat use, and Cochinchinese specific boatbuilding features over time. As such, this thesis illuminates the maritime past of Cochinchina from a maritime perspective, and by making the multi-disciplinary study of boat use its centrepiece, it stands at the cross-roads of maritime <b>archaeology,</b> <b>nautical</b> technology and maritime history...|$|R
500|$|Whiting was {{abandoned}} {{over the next}} few days and the crew salvaged whatever they could. The officer in charge, Lieutenant John Jackson, lost one year's seniority for negligence, and three crewmen were given [...] "50 lashes with nine tails" [...] for desertion. The wreck was sold to salvors and, despite correspondence requesting salvage eleven years later, the navy took no further interest. The Royal Navy attempted to survey the wreck in June 1830, by which time the sandbank had covered most of it. In May 2010 a marine research and exploration group, ProMare, and the <b>Nautical</b> <b>Archaeology</b> Society, with the help of Padstow Primary School, mounted a search for the ship. The groups searched four sites on the Doom Bar, but have so far been unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|The modern {{search for}} the Mary Rose was {{initiated}} by the Southsea branch of the British Sub-Aqua Club in 1965 {{as part of a}} project to locate shipwrecks in the Solent. The project was under the leadership of historian, journalist and amateur diver Alexander McKee. Another group led by Lieutenant-Commander Alan Bax of the Royal Navy, sponsored by the Committee for <b>Nautical</b> <b>Archaeology</b> in London, also formed a search team. Initially the two teams had differing views on where to find the wreck, but eventually joined forces. In February 1966 a chart from 1841 was found that marked the positions of the Mary Rose and several other wrecks. The charted position coincided with a trench (one of the scour pits) that had already been located by McKee's team, and a definite location was finally established at a position 3km (1.9mi) south of the entrance to Portsmouth Harbour (...) in water with a depth of [...] (36feet) at low tide. Diving on the site began in 1966 and a sonar scan by Harold Edgerton in 1967–68 revealed some type of buried feature. In 1970 a loose timber was located and on [...] 1971, the first structural details of the buried hull were identified after they were partially uncovered by winter storms.|$|E

[...] It was not until 2002 that the first designations came into force. [...] The announcement stated that there would be sixteen controlled sites (in waters under UK control), and five designated protected places (five UK wrecks in international waters and one German U-boat in UK waters), with four of the Falkland wrecks HMS Ardent, HMS Antelope, HMS Coventry and HMS Sheffield listed as controlled sites. [...] The order only covered eleven controlled sites, which did not include the Falkland wrecks. [...] HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse (the ships of Force Z) as well as HMS Hampshire were included in the designations. [...] However, HMS Ardent and HMS Antelope were already protected (as prohibited sites because they were considered dangerous) by an order passed in 1983 under the Falkland Islands Protection of Wrecks Ordinance 1977.

2500|$|Because of the {{increasing}} popularity and higher risk of wreck diving, many diver training organizations such as Scuba Diving International and the Professional Association of Diving Instructors provide specialist wreck diver training courses, which divers are advised to take before wreck diving.

[...] Most recreational diving organizations teach divers only to penetrate to at most the limit of the [...] "light zone" [...] or a maximum aggregate surface distance (depth and penetration) of 100 feet. [...] Other technical diving organizations, such as IANTD, TDI and ANDI teach advanced wreck courses that emphasize a higher level of training, experience and equipment and prepare divers for deeper levels of wreck penetration. The <b>Nautical</b> <b>Archaeology</b> Society in the UK, teaches awareness of underwater cultural heritage issues as well as practical diver and archaeological skills.

2500|$|Maritime {{archaeology}} (also {{known as}} marine archaeology) is a discipline within archaeology {{as a whole}} [...] that specifically studies human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers through the study of [...] associated physical remains, be they [...] vessels, shore side facilities, port-related structures, cargoes, human remains and submerged landscapes. [...] A specialty within maritime archaeology is <b>nautical</b> <b>archaeology,</b> which studies vessel construction and use. As with archaeology as a whole, maritime archaeology can be practised within the historical, industrial, or prehistoric periods. [...] An associated discipline, and again one that lies within archaeology itself, is [...] underwater archaeology, which studies the past through any submerged remains be they of maritime interest or not. An example from the prehistoric era [...] would be [...] the remains of submerged settlements or deposits now lying under water despite having been dry land when sea levels were lower. The study of submerged aircraft lost in lakes, rivers or in the sea is an example from the historical, industrial or modern era. [...] Many specialist sub-disciplines within the broader maritime and [...] underwater archaeological categories have emerged in recent years.|$|E
2500|$|Wrecks are {{designated}} {{by name and}} can be designated as protected places even if {{the location of the}} site is not known. [...] Thus, the wreckage of a UK military aircraft is automatically a protected place even if the physical remains have not been previously discovered or identified. [...] Shipwrecks need to be specifically designated, and designation as a protected place applies only to vessels that sank after 4 August 1914 (the date of the United Kingdom's entry into the First World War). [...] The Act makes it an offence to interfere with a protected place, to disturb the site or to remove anything from the site. [...] Divers may visit the site but the rule is look, don't touch and don't penetrate. [...] The law concerning protected places applies anywhere in the world, but in practice, outside the UK, the sanctions can only be enforced against UK citizens, UK flagged ships, or vessels landing in the UK, unless backed by local legislation. [...] The first and only license granted in respect of a vessel designated a protected place was granted to Mike Williams of the <b>Nautical</b> <b>Archaeology</b> Society, for a project to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the loss of the M2 submarine including the placing of a white ensign underwater.|$|E
