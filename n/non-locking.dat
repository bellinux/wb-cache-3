25|$|NEMA <b>non-locking</b> {{connectors}} all use {{blades of}} various flat and folded shapes (except for the round pins used on grounding connectors). The plugs can be {{detached from the}} receptacles by pulling back on the plug body. These connector families have been designed so that connectors of differing types cannot be accidentally intermated.|$|E
25|$|An open (<b>non-locking</b> or {{otherwise}} traction-aided) differential always supplies close to equal torque to each side. To illustrate how this can limit torque {{applied to the}} driving wheels, imagine a simple rear-wheel drive vehicle, with one rear roadwheel on asphalt with good grip, {{and the other on}} a patch of slippery ice. It takes very little torque to spin the side on slippery ice, and because a differential splits torque equally to each side, the torque that is applied to the side that is on asphalt is limited to this amount.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{hood of the}} DeLorean had grooves {{running down}} both sides. It included a gas flap to simplify fuel filling. The gas flap was built so that the trunk could {{be added to the}} total cargo area of the DeLorean. These cars typically had a locking gas cap to prevent siphoning. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases stayed). This style was retained well into 1982. Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking gas caps was exhausted, the company switched to a <b>non-locking</b> version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no gas flap, but with locking gas caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of gas flap hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanationâ€”Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the gas flap design.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two basic}} classifications of NEMA connectors: {{straight-blade}} and locking. The metal conductive blades are often informally called [...] "prongs" [...] (as in [...] "3-prong plug"). Numbers prefixed by 'L' are curved-blade, twist-locking connectors; others without a leading 'L' are straight blade and <b>non-locking.</b> Twist-locking types are used for heavy industrial and commercial equipment, where increased protection against accidental disconnection is required.|$|E
2500|$|Emerson Knives {{primarily}} manufactures tactical folding knives {{utilizing the}} Walker linerlock. [...] EKI most commonly machines blades of Crucible's 154CM steel {{by using the}} stock-removal method. [...] Small runs of knives have been produced utilizing steels such as CPM S30V steel, CPM S35VN, and Titanium with a carbide edge. [...] The handles are constructed with titanium liners, G10 fiberglass scales, and a G10 backspacer. [...] Since 2009 EKI has been using a stainless steel liner on the <b>non-locking</b> side {{in order to keep}} costs down.|$|E
2500|$|Twist-locking {{connectors}} {{were first}} invented by Harvey Hubbell III in 1938 and [...] "Twist-Lock" [...] remains a registered trademark of Hubbell Incorporated, although {{the term is}} used generically to refer to NEMA locking connectors manufactured by any company. Locking connectors use curved blades. Once pushed into the receptacle, the plug is twisted and its now-rotated blades latch into the receptacle. To unlatch the plug, the rotation is reversed. The locking coupling makes for a more reliable connection in commercial and industrial settings, where vibration or incidental impact could disconnect a <b>non-locking</b> connector.|$|E
2500|$|The 30A {{plug and}} {{receptacle}} look {{similar to the}} 15A one but larger. The higher-current versions are rare, with twist-locking plugs such as L6-30 or direct wiring more common. Generally 6-series <b>non-locking</b> plugs are used for such appliances as large room air conditioners, commercial kitchen equipment, and the occasional home arc welder. Single-phase 6-50 is commonly used on farms for silo unloaders, and is used with a 6-gauge flexible power cord up to [...] long. Some manufacturers of electric vehicle charging stations equip their 30-40A Level 2 EVSEs with a 6-50 plug on a short cord, though it is becoming less common, with manufacturers now favoring the more common 14-50 plug.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, US {{curbside}} mailboxes {{are classified}} as (T) Traditional, (C) Contemporary, or (L) Locking. Traditional or Contemporary <b>non-locking</b> curbside mailboxes are approved in three sizes - No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3, measured by minimum interior dimensions. The largest acceptable curbside mailbox is the No. 3, which measures 22.81inches long, 11inches wide, and 15inches in height (58cm x 28cm x 38cm) at the peak. Locking mailbox designs that provide security for the recipient's incoming mail have fewer restrictions on shape and size, though designs with a slot for incoming mail {{must be at least}} 1.75inches high by 10inches wide. Residential locking mailboxes cannot require the postal carrier to have a key, by USPS Specifications. [...] Therefore, no USPS approved residential locking mailbox has secure outgoing mail. Installation requirements vary from standard unlocked mailboxes: with locking mailboxes, the incoming mail slot must be 41"-45" [...] above the roadside surface, and the front of the mailbox must be 6"-8" [...] back from the curb. [...] USPS specifications for all mailboxes mandate the same, except the placement of the 'incoming mail area' varies with a locking mailbox.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1950s, {{large numbers}} of folding switchblade or {{automatic}} opening knives with locking blades were imported from Italy to the United States. Most of these switchblades were side-opening designs, though some employed a telescoping blade. [...] These Italian switchblades were commonly and popularly referred to as stilettos, since most incorporated a long, slender blade tapering to a needle-like point, together with a slim-profile handle and vestigial cross-guard. [...] The majority of these Italian stiletto switchblade knives used a now-iconic bayonet-style blade with a single sabre-grind edge (often unsharpened) and a long opposing false edge. [...] As with the medieval stiletto, the stiletto switchblade was designed primarily as an offensive weapon, optimized for thrusting rather than cutting. [...] Most of these knives were designed with a locking device which locked the blade in the open position, and this lock, combined with the stiletto blade profile, enabled the knife {{to be used as}} an effective thrusting or stabbing weapon (unlike most U.S. switchblade designs of the day). [...] Though most switchblade stilettos used a single-edge blade equipped with a long false edge, many variations exist. [...] The stiletto switchblade is produced to this day in Italy and many other countries, and now includes many derivative folding knife designs that incorporate the same basic 'stiletto' or bayonet-style blade profile, including spring-assist, <b>non-locking,</b> and lock blade variants.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Non-locking</b> (or vintage) tremolos are {{the bridges}} found on guitars {{manufactured}} {{prior to the}} advent of the Floyd Rose locking tremolo in the late 1970s and many (typically cheaper) guitars manufactured thereafter. For many playing styles, vintage tremolos are a good choice because they are easy to use and maintain and have very few parts. Some people feel that they can also provide a better degree of sound transfer, especially with tailpiece type tremolos such as the Bigsby. However, the [...] "Synchronized Tremolo" [...] type found on the Fender Stratocaster is balanced against a set of screws in much the same manner as a locking tremolo. Given that this type of tremolo is installed on solid body guitars the degree to which sound transfer affects the sound that the instrument produces is minimal. Also, keeping a guitar with a <b>non-locking</b> tremolo in tune can be difficult. The most common types of <b>non-locking</b> tremolos are the [...] "Synchronized Tremolo" [...] type and an almost endless stream of copies. The Bigsby vibrato tailpiece is another option.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of forceps: <b>non-locking</b> (often called 'thumb forceps' or 'pick-ups') and locking, though these two types come in dozens of {{specialized}} forms for various uses. <b>Non-locking</b> forceps also come in two basic forms: hinged at one end, away from the grasping end (colloquially such forceps are called tweezers) and hinged in the middle, rather like scissors. Locking forceps are almost always hinged in the middle, though some forms place the hinge {{very close to the}} grasping end. Locking forceps use various means to lock the grasping surfaces in a closed position to facilitate manipulation or to independently clamp, grasp or hold an object.|$|E
5000|$|Carabiners {{exist in}} various forms; {{the shape of}} the {{carabiner}} and the type of gate varies according to the use for which it is intended. There are two major varieties: locking and <b>non-locking</b> carabiners. Locking carabiners offer a method of preventing the gate from opening when in use. Locking carabiners are used for important connections, such as at the anchor point or a belay device. There are several different types of locking carabiners, including a twist-lock and a thread-lock. Twist-lock carabiners are commonly referred to as [...] "auto-locking carabiners" [...] due to their spring-loaded locking mechanism. <b>Non-locking</b> carabiners are commonly found as a component of quickdraws.|$|E
