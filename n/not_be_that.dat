2500|$|Stevi Jackson, {{a scholar}} of gender and sexuality, begins an {{analysis}} of forced seduction (in [...] "The Social Context of Rape", first published 1978) with the [...] "sexual scripts" [...] that culture male and female sexuality, which for the male posit [...] "supposedly uncontrollable sexual aggression". [...] "Conventional sexual scripts" [...] also dictate that [...] "a woman's satisfaction {{is assumed to be}} dependent on male activity" [...] and that [...] "women need some degree of persuasion" [...] before they will engage in sex. Once this obstacle (dictated by inhibitions and propriety) is overcome, they gladly surrender themselves: [...] "the masterful male and yielding female form a common motif of our popular culture", lending credibility to not a female but rather a male rape fantasy. Jackson's generalizing comment on seduction from this article is cited in at least two legal and ethical studies: [...] "It may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> rape is forced seduction but that seduction is a subtler form of rape".|$|E
2500|$|In September 1940 Maffey {{approached}} the Irish External Affairs Secretary, Joseph Walshe, to inform him ‘of the intended increase of light naval craft’ in Lough Foyle. The Royal Navy increased {{its use of}} Lough Foyle {{in the early months}} of 1941. The Royal Navy remained concerned {{that there might be a}} challenge to its use of the Foyle on the grounds that ships navigating the river to Lisahally and Londonderry might be infringing Irish neutrality. If the border followed the median line of Lough Foyle then the channel might be in Irish waters as it [...] "lies near to the Eire shore". In mid-November 1941, legal opinions of solicitors to The Honourable The Irish Society were presented to the Royal Navy. The Hon. The Irish Society's view was that the whole of Lough Foyle was part of County Londonderry and accordingly the border could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of the median line of Lough Foyle. The Royal Navy continued to use its new base on the Foyle until 1970.|$|E
2500|$|Reid {{discusses}} {{the possibility that}} Sydney Valpy Radley-Walters' A Squadron of the Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment, 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade, positioned on the left flank of the advancing German tanks, was responsible instead. Situated {{on the grounds of}} a chateau at Gaumesnil, the unit had created firing holes in the property’s walls and, based on verbal testimony, engaged the advancing German tanks, including Tigers. The British tanks were between [...] and [...] away from the German line of advance, whereas the Canadian squadron was around [...] away. Reid argues that due to the Canadians' proximity to the Germans, and the firing angle, their troops more than likely can be credited with the destruction of Wittmann's tank. Reid also relies on H. Holfinger's account of the engagement to support his thesis Holfinger was in a Tiger approximately 250 meters behind Wittmann and he indicates that Wittmann's Tiger was destroyed at 12h55. Ekin's crew was credited with the destruction of 3 Tigers, at 12h40, 12h47 and 12h52, Wittmann's tank being probably the one destroyed at 12h47. Considering Holfinger's account, Reid concludes that the Tiger destroyed at 12h47 could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of Wittmann; he also notes that the circumstances surrounding the fate of the Tiger destroyed at 12h52 exclude the possibility {{that it could have been}} Wittmann's [...]|$|E

2500|$|Researchers have posed a few core {{explanations}} for the overrepresentation of LGBT youth in the general United States homeless youth population. LGBT youth {{are more likely to}} be homeless because they run away or are evicted due to family conflict surrounding their sexual orientation or behavior. This explanation is supported by a 2011 survey study of a representative Massachusetts high school sample that found that LGBT youth were no more likely to be homeless and living with their parents than non-LGBT youth. Therefore, according to the study's authors, it may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> LGBT youth {{are more likely to be}} part of a homeless family, but rather that their higher rate of homelessness is caused by being more likely to be evicted or run away. A 2008 study using in-person interviews found that among youth who experienced homelessness for more than six months, lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth were more likely than heterosexual youth to report being verbally or physically harassed by family. In addition, LGBT youth are more likely to be homeless due to physical or sexual abuse experienced at home. [...] The Hetrick-Martin Institute showed that among homeless queer girls aged 13–15 in New York City, that 50% of them were homeless because they were fleeing familial corrective rape. [...] In the background of both these explanations is the fact that, since the family conflicts associated with LGBT youth occur relatively late in a youth's development, LGBT youth are much less likely to be placed in foster care. Those who are placed in a foster home find an unwelcoming or hostile environment, and a study on the New York City Child Welfare System reported 78% of LGBTQ youth were kicked out, or ran away from their foster home as a result. Finally, a number of other factors that lead to increased risk of homelessness in adolescents disproportionately affect LGBT youth, such as experiencing conflict at school.|$|E
