5|$|In 1996, the Southern Management Company, a firm {{responsible}} for managing residential apartments complexes, {{filed a lawsuit}} against the sheriff and the county government, with the plaintiffs alleging that they lost revenue due to the sheriff's office inability to evict tenants who were <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> their rent costs.|$|E

McMahon announced a match {{between the two}} the next night on Raw. The third contest was between Kenny Dykstra and Ric Flair. The end of the match saw Dykstra executing an illegal low blow, when the referee was <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> attention and rolled Flair up with a small package to secure the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson played pubs with Shots on {{a regular}} basis to small audiences. One {{particular}} night, Dickinson suddenly stopped {{in the middle of a}} song and started interviewing a man in the audience, heckling for <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> enough attention. He got such a good response he started doing it every night until it became a regular routine used to catch the audience's attention. Dickinson states that this experience taught him how to be a frontman.|$|E
5|$|Producers in the Indies {{would often}} handle {{multiple}} roles, such as director and cinematographer. When these positions were filled separately, the producer retained creative control. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that works produced {{during this time}} were emphatically commercial, <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> attention to nationalistic or aesthetic values. However, the film scholars Thomas Barker and Charlotte Setijadi-Dunn suggest that the Chinese-produced films from the Indies offered {{the possibility of a}} heterogeneous national identity.|$|E

5|$|After marrying {{his niece}} Martina and being crowned by the Patriarch, the 35-year-old Heraclius {{set out to}} perform his work as emperor. Phocas' brother, Comentiolus, {{commanded}} a sizable force in central Anatolia but was assassinated by the Armenian commander Justin, removing {{a major threat to}} Heraclius' reign. Still, transfer of the forces commanded by Comentiolus had been delayed, allowing the Persians to advance further in Anatolia. Trying to increase revenues and reduce costs, Heraclius limited the number of state-sponsored personnel of the Church in Constantinople by <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> new staff from the imperial fisc. He used ceremonies to legitimize his dynasty, and he secured a reputation for justice to strengthen his grip on power.|$|E

He went through a growth spurt before his sophomore year and added speed to his fastball. He also raised his GPA {{and was able to}} get back on the team, where he had a 9–3 record with a 1.18 earned run average (ERA) as a sophomore, tossing three no-hitters.|$|E

A lot of people don’t seem to understand that we can’t keep producing records if you keep <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as much support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will not get a chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E

Bubblegum tells Finn and Jake about the dream, {{and the three of}} them journey to the tree at the top of Bubblegum's palace where the block of amber is hidden; Bubblegum also places magical jewels on Finn and Jake's heads that will prevent the Lich from exerting mind-control on them. While examining the amber, a snail is placed under the Lich's spell and helps break him out while Finn and Jake are <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> attention. The Lich then blasts out of the kingdom, leaving a wave of destruction in his path.|$|E
5|$|Although the British were victorious {{over the}} French in the war, King George III's {{government}} {{felt that the}} North American colonies were <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> their way, since little direct tax revenue from the colonies was received. The Sugar Act of 1764 had its greatest effect in New England and did not cause widespread objection. The Stamp Act the following year affected all 13 colonies, as it required revenue stamps to be used on papers required in trade and in the law. When word of passage of the Stamp Act reached Williamsburg, the House of Burgesses passed the Virginia Resolves, asserting that Virginians had {{the same rights as}} if they resided in Britain, and that they could only be taxed by themselves or their elected representatives. The Resolves were mostly written by a fiery-spoken new member for Louisa County, Patrick Henry.|$|E
5|$|Broad Channel is a {{small island}} with fewer than 3,000 residents, and as a result, it has {{historically}} {{been one of the}} least-used stations in the system. In 1985, the station had only 224 paying daily riders on a typical weekday not counting farebeaters (people <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> their fare) {{making it one of the}} least used stations in the system. The station has the second-lowest ridership in the subway system as of 2015, with 91,766 annual riders, or 310 riders per weekday. In terms of annual ridership, it was only trailed by Cortlandt Street, a station that is closed to be rebuilt as a result of damage from the September 11 attacks. Overall, Broad Channel is the least used of any fully operating subway station in the city, although on weekdays it has on average 5 more riders than the Beach 105th Street station. However, it is the only transfer point between the A train and the Rockaway Park Shuttle, and some 2,700 daily riders use it in this capacity. As a result, the platforms are sometimes packed.|$|E

5|$|In October 2009, Mike Ashley {{announced}} {{that he planned to}} lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium. This name was only supposed to be used {{until the end of the}} 2009–10 season, but lasted until November 2011. On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this will most likely be an interim name, as it is only being used to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium. The company, owned by Ashley, were <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> anything for the deal. However, if another company purchases the naming rights, they will be expected to pay between £8 million and £10 million. Many fans voiced their anger at the renaming, but Managing Director Derek Llambias has said that it was necessary to give Newcastle extra money so that they compete with the bigger clubs in the league.|$|E
5|$|Martin Varno's {{dissatisfaction with}} the Cormans {{eventually}} led him to take them into formal arbitration proceedings. Although Varno was {{not a member of}} the Writers Guild of America when he wrote the Blood Beast script, he was encouraged by actor Jay Jostyn to discuss the matter with them. According to Varno, Jostyn claimed several actors and writers had similar problems with the Cormans in the past, but were not taking action because the Cormans provided them continued work in their films. After meeting with the Writers Guild, Varno became a member and filed arbitration papers against the Cormans for <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> him enough. Roger Corman was in the process of editing the film when he received the arbitration notice, and he became so angry he started screaming and throwing things in the cutting room. Varno claims one of the film crew members approached him (Varno) and promised that the Cormans would hire Varno to work on many of their future films if he dropped the matter, but Varno refused.|$|E
5|$|Gui {{returned}} to China in 1999 {{and started a}} daughter company in Ningbo for a Swedish company known in Chinese as Tangyou (唐友), offering air purification products. Gui {{was involved in a}} drink-driving incident in Ningbo in December 2003 in which a 23-year-old girl was killed while crossing the road. The victim's mother disagreed with the police investigation report that her daughter should bear secondary responsibility for <b>not</b> <b>paying</b> attention to traffic, since she had heard from witnesses that the car had been speeding, so she risked her life to experiment on herself {{with the help of her}} son and a driver for 10 days, demonstrating that the driving speed had to exceed 110 km/h for the accident to occur. She appealed to the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, which upon reexamination concluded that Gui should bear full responsibility for the incident in May 2004. Her experiment was widely reported in the Chinese media. The victim's parents later filed a civil lawsuit against Gui for compensation. The Ningbo Municipal Intermediate People's Court ruled the following August that Gui had committed a crime, for which Gui received a two-year suspended jail term. He then departed for Germany, thus violated his probation terms. In 2004, after leaving China, he worked for a German affiliate of Nordpool Consulting.|$|E
