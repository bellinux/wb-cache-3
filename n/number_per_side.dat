In an unlimited, timed or declaration match, the main aim of the bowling attack will be to take wickets, so attacking bowling and fielding strategies will be used.

Once the danger has passed, that player (the [...] "rush goalie") returns to normal outfield play.

5|$|Over {{the thirty}} years from 1880 onwards, rule changes were {{incrementally}} {{introduced into the}} game, including {{the adoption of the}} line of scrimmage, scoring that began to resemble the modern version, and the down and yardage structure. Popular personalities of the era included player-coach Joe Wright Sr., one of the best all around Canadian athletes {{at the turn of the}} century. One major outstanding issue within the CRU at the time was the role of professional versus amateur players; this dispute caused the Argonauts to withdraw from the league in 1903 and eventually led to the establishment of a new league, The Big Four or Interprovincial Rugby Football League. Alongside the professionalism dispute, there was serious disagreement over the adoption of the Burnside rules, with Ontario, Quebec, and the intercollegiate league often not in alignment. Amongst other critical innovations, the Burnside rules reduced the <b>number</b> of men <b>per</b> <b>side</b> to 12 and introduced the ten yards in three downs structure that is central to the modern game.|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) can form 1 1 molar {{complexes}} with alkyloxy discotic compounds, thereby enhancing their mesomorphic properties. In particular, when hexaalkyloxytriphenylenes (THEn) (n being the <b>number</b> of carbons <b>per</b> <b>side</b> chain) are crystallized from, or mixed with, TFA, complexes are formed which exhibit the Dho(Colho) mesophase, {{as do the}} neat THEn's, but with {{a broader range of}} thermal stability and a higher degree of order. The mesophases of these complexes are completely miscible with those of the neat compounds. Likewise, 1 1 mixtures of hexa-alkyloxytribenzocyclononene (TBCEn) and TFA yield complexes showing enhanced mesomorphic properties for the mesogenic homologues of this series and induced mesomorphism for the lower homologues, which in the neat form are not mesogenic. The mesomorphic properties of these TFA complexes with THEn (n= 3 - 6) and with TBCEn (n= 4 - 6) are investigated by means of optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. It is suggested that the enhancement of the mesomorphic properties is due to formation of oxonium ion complexes...|$|R

40|$|A new {{homologous}} series of compounds, nonaalkanoyloxy tribenzocyclononene (TBCN-n, where n is the <b>number</b> of carbons <b>per</b> <b>side</b> chain) with n= 2 to 14 was synthesized. The compounds exist in two isomeric forms, crown and saddle. For sufficiently long side chains (n S 4 for {{the saddle and}} n S 5 for the crown) the homologues of both series are mesogenic, exhibiting columnar hexagonal mesophases. The mesomorphic properties of the compounds were studied by differential scanning calorimetry, optical polarizing microscopy, X-ray diffraction and carbon- 13 solid state NMR spectroscopy. No interconversion between the crown and saddle isomers is observed in the solid and mesophases (except very slow saddle to crown transformation, close to the clearing points of the mesophase), but isomerization is fast in the melt. This leads to peculiar phase diagrams which {{are discussed in the}} text. Analysis of the carbon- 13 NMR spectra indicates that in the crown mesophases there is rapid reorientation of the molecules about the columnar axes, while no such motion is found in the mesophases of the saddle isomers. The latter appear, however, to undergo thermally activated high-amplitude librations, which freeze out on cooling to room temperature and below...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new algorithm, IRECS (Iterative REduction of Conformational Space), for identifying ensembles of most probable side-chain conformations for homology modeling. On {{the basis of a}} given rotamer library, IRECS ranks all side-chain rotamers of a protein according to the probability with which each side chain adopts the respective rotamer conformation. This ranking enables the user to select small rotamer sets that are most likely to contain a near-native rotamer for each side chain. IRECS can therefore act as a fast heuristic alternative to the Dead-End-Elimination algorithm (DEE). In contrast to DEE, IRECS allows for the selection of rotamer subsets of arbitrary size, thus being able to define structure ensembles for a protein. We show that the selection of more than one rotamer <b>per</b> <b>side</b> chain is generally meaningful, since the selected rotamers represent the conformational space of flexible side chains. A knowledge-based statistical potential ROTA was constructed for the IRECS algorithm. The potential was optimized to discriminate between side-chain conformations of native and rotameric decoys of protein structures. By restricting the <b>number</b> of rotamers <b>per</b> <b>side</b> chain to one, IRECS can optimize side chains for a single conformation model. The average accuracy of IRECS for the χ 1 and χ 1 + 2 dihedral angles amounts to 84. 7 % and 71. 6 %, respectively, using a 40 ° cutoff. When we compared IRECS with SCWRL and SCAP, the performance of IRECS was comparable to that of both methods. IRECS and the ROTA potential are available for download from the URL [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Two {{methods for}} restricting plant height (CCC {{application}} and excision {{of the main}} shoot apex) were applied to okra cv. ‘Boyiatiou’ {{with the aim of}} assisting crop management and optimizing yield. Apex excision 26 or 40 days after transplantation (DAT) effectively restricted plant height, but either had no effect (40 DAT) or reduced the <b>number</b> of <b>side</b> shoots <b>per</b> plant (26 DAT). Moreover, although the length of side shoots increased after apex excision, the <b>number</b> of nodes <b>per</b> <b>side</b> shoot was not affected. Hence pod number and weight was less than in the control (untreated). CCC application (500 and 2000 ppm) reduced plant height due to a reduction in internode length; however, when applied at the time of transplantation (0 DAT) (both concentrations) or 26 DAT (2000 ppm) it also caused a reduction in node number on the main stem. CCC did not affect the number of side shoots or the <b>number</b> of nodes <b>per</b> shoot, and <b>side</b> shoot length decreased due to shorter internode lengths. The number and weight of pods per plant was reduced by 2000 ppm CCC irrespective of the time of application, but was not affected by 500 ppm CCC at 0 DAT (pod number) or 40 DAT (pod weight and number). We conclude that the application of 500 ppm CCC at 40 DAT may aid okra cultivation since it reduces overall plant size (height and diameter) without adversely affecting yield, and may thus assist crop management (e. g. easier hand-harvesting) and permit an increase in plant density...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To assess {{treatment}} {{effectiveness and}} safety of bilateral same-session ureterorenoscopy (BSSU) {{for the management of}} stone disease involving the entire urinary system. Patients and methods: We reviewed the records of 64 patients who underwent BSSU for the treatment of bilateral ureteric and/or kidney stones. Size, <b>number,</b> location <b>per</b> <b>side,</b> and the total burden of stones were recorded. Data on stenting, lithotripsy, and stone retrieval, and details of hospital stay and operation times were investigated. Treatment results were assessed using intraoperative findings and postoperative imaging. The outcome was considered successful in patients who were completely stone-free or who had only residual fragments of â¤ 2 â¯mm. Results: The outcome was successful in 82. 8 % of the patients who received BSSU (54. 7 % stone-free and 28. 1 % insignificant residual fragments). The success rate per renal unit was 89. 8 %. There were no adverse events in 73. 4 % of the patients. The most common intraoperative complication was mucosal injury (36 %). The complications were ClavienâDindo Grade I in 9. 4 % and Grade II in 7. 8 %. Grade IIIa and IIIb (9. 4 %) complications required re-treatments. Statistical evaluation showed no association between complication grades and stone, patient, or operation features. Stone burden had no negative impact on BSSU results. The presence of impacted proximal ureteric stones was significantly related to unsuccessful outcomes. Conclusion: BSSU is safe and effective for the management of bilateral urolithiasis. BSSU can prevent recurrent surgeries, reduce overall hospital stay, and achieve a stone-free status and complication rates that are comparable to those of unilateral or staged bilateral procedures.
