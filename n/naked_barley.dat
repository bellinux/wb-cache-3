Archaeobotanical analyses were applied to 130, 578 seeds/fruits, residue analyses involved 87 samples from cooking and storing vessels, whereas analyses of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes included 63 human bone samples and 26 animal specimens. The results indicate that from the mid-eighth century AD, crop production was of high quality similar, to that of the Roman Age. The main cultivations were <b>naked</b> wheats, <b>barley</b> and horse bean, a diversity that attests the technological skills reached by Tuscan peasants during the whole Middle Ages. Different cereals and pulse abundantly supplemented the diet. This strategy not only ensured peasants’ subsistence in the mid-eighth century AD, minimizing the risks of environmental adversities, but it also increased crop production – from the mid-ninth century AD on, for the revived markets and trade. Between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries AD, C 4 plants had a dominant role in the peasants’ diet, when the wheat production was strictly collected first by the landlords and then by the cities for their own needs. Crop production was integrated by swine farming; animal meat consumption is well documented in rural and urban populations from the ninth century AD. Wine and olive oil, considered important elements of diet in Medieval Tuscany, have a very scarce presence, but they are recorded for later periods, mainly in urban areas and in higher social classes, such as the religious and aristocratic ones. In fact, only between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries AD was the great expansion of olive groves and vineyards recorded, when cities and urban populations claim to have access to these luxury foods...|$|R
40|$|Most cereal crops have hulless grains (naked caryopses) with a free-threshing trait, {{whereas the}} {{majority}} of barley cultivars show hulled (covered) caryopses. The <b>naked</b> caryopsis in <b>barley</b> is genetically controlled by a single locus, nod. The Nud gene (the covered caryopsis allele) encodes an ethylene response factor (ERF) family transcription factor that regulates a lipid biosynthetic pathway. For functional analysis of the barley Nud gene, we produced transgenic rice expressing Nod in the developing caryopses. All transgenic lines had caryopses that were easily dehulled at maturity, indicating that the naked caryopsis phenotype remained in spite of expression of the Nod transgene. Histochemical and lipid analyses of the transgenic rice caryopses did not show increased lipid accumulation {{on the surface of}} developing caryopses, suggesting that the Nud-mediated lipid pathway may not function in rice caryopses. The predicted rice ortholog of Nod, Os 06 ERF was expressed specifically in the developing caryopses. However, expression of Os 06 ERF ceased at an earlier developmental stage than that of the native Nod gene in barley caryopses, which was also the case for expression of the Nod transgene. This raises the alternative hypothesis that the timing of Nod expression may be critical for activating the pathway for hull-caryopsis adhesion...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{influence}} of enzyme supplementation on the bioavailable energy (AMEn) and apparent digestibilities of lipid (ALD) and protein (APD) in young broiler chicks was examined for diets containing either wheat, hulled or hulless <b>barley,</b> <b>naked</b> oats, or spring rye. Dietary AMEn, APD, and ALD values were depressed (P <. 01) for all test grains (except hulled Bedford barley) as the inclusion {{rate of the}} grain replacing wheat increased. The antinutritives, (3 -glucans (barley and oats) and pentosans (rye), had the most pronounced effect on ALD. The decreases in ALD were 43, 77, and 67 % for chicks fed diets containing 70 % Scout barley (hulless), Terra oats, and Gazelle rye, respectively, compared with those fed the control wheat diet. Enzyme supplementation increased (P <. 01) AMEn, APD, and ALD for all test cereals. The corresponding increases in the AMEn, of the enzyme-supplemented diets containing 70 % HY 320 wheat, Bedford barley, Scout barley, Terra oats, and Gazelle rye diets were 4, 7, 42, 33, and 14 %, respectively, compared with their unsupplemented counterparts. Enzyme treatment also improved (P <. 01) weight gains and feed conversion efficiencies of chicks fed diets containing each of the cereals.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of inter-disciplinary work drawing on archaeobotanical and archaeometric studies to trace the agroforestry landscape and the supply economy at the vicus of Thamusida in north-west Morocco at the border of the Roman Empire. The available data indicate the self-sufficiency of the settlement in both forestry and agricultural products throughout the period investigated {{from the end of the}} 1 st century BC to the beginning of the 4 th century AD. Charcoal data testify to the presence of a Quercus suber forest in the close surroundings of the site and its exploitation for a variety of forestry products such as timber, fuelwood, cork, and probably also leaves and acorns to feed livestock. The overwhelming presence of Q. suber in the archaeological layer investigated clearly indicates that this forest was under human influence prior to Roman occupation and was already partially degraded. Charred seed and fruit remains suggest that the diet of both troops and civilians was mainly based on locally grown products and that all the inhabitants of the site had access to good cereals such as <b>barley,</b> <b>naked</b> wheats and pulses with large seeds such as horse bean and pea; quality fruits, such as olive and grape, were also produced locally for fresh consumption. Organic residue analyses of the contents of ceramic vessels and plastered vats allowed archaeobotanical data to be complemented, thereby shedding light on some of the imports at Thamusida.

In Exp. 1, the effect of 24 cereals vs. a common reference diet containing white rice on feed preference in pigs was studied. Pigs were offered free choice between the reference diet and a diet with the cereal under study for 4 d. Barley, corn (2 sources), wheat, cassava meal, biscuit meal, rye, sorghum, and 1 source of oats were tested at inclusion rates of 300 and 600 g-kg- 1. Shortgrain rice (whole, brown, or extruded white), long-grain white rice (raw and cooked), extruded barley, extruded corn, extruded wheat, oats (2 sources), thick rolled oats, cooked oats, and naked oats (raw, extruded, or micronized) were tested at inclusion rates of 150, 300, and 600 g-kg- 1. Relative preference of cereals (% of total feed intake) was affected by type of cereal and by rate of inclusion. The diets containing extruded rice (150 g·kg- 1), extruded naked oats (150, 300, and 600 g·kg- 1), or naked oats (150 and 300 g·kg- 1) were preferred (P < 0. 05) by pigs to the reference diet. However, the reference diet was preferred (P < 0. 05) to the diets containing 150, 300, and 600 g·kg- 1 of cooked long-grain rice, oats, or cooked oats, 300 and 600 g·kg- 1 of extruded wheat, wheat, corn, sorghum, or unhulled short-grain rice, and 600 g·kg- 1 of thick rolled oats, extruded corn, rye, extruded <b>barley,</b> micronized <b>naked</b> oats, <b>barley,</b> cassava, or biscuit meal.

Additionally, direct 2 -way choices were also performed between oats and barley diets and between diets presented in mash and pelleted forms. Pigs preferred barley to oats, and preferred diets presented in pelleted form to those presented in mash form.

This is mainly because of need for lower variable costs caused by disease control, liming and fertilisation. Two thirds of Finnish oat production is directly consumed on farms as livestock feed. In the feed use of grain, the value is based on energy values, nutritional values and digestibility. In terms of energy yield, wheat and <b>naked</b> oat exceed <b>barley.</b> But the hectare-based energy yield of dehulled conventional oat is {{lower than that of}} barley aswell owing to the significant loss during dehulling (20 %). In terms of nutritive value, naked oat is a competitive cereal even if the yield was moderate. An economic study accommodating the feed values and yield levels of naked oat proves that naked oat is a competitive alternative for oat, dehulled oat and barley. For pigs and poultry, naked oat is also more economical than wheat in the Finnish conditions. When comparing conventional oat with naked oat, it is necessary to consider the higher processing costs caused by the hulls of conventional oat in various phases of production.

40|$|Antisense {{oligodeoxynucleotide}} (ODN) inhibition {{emerges as}} an effective means for probing gene function in plant cells. Employing this method we have established {{the importance of the}} SUSIBA 2 transcription factor for regulation of starch synthesis in barley endosperm, and arrived at a model for the role of the SUSIBAs in sugar signaling and source-sink commutation during cereal endosperm development. In this addendum we provide additional data demonstrating the suitability of the antisense ODN technology in studies on starch branching enzyme activities in barley leaves. We also comment on the mechanism for ODN uptake in plant cells. Antisense ODNs are short (12 - 25 nt-long) stretches of single-stranded ODNs that hybridize to the cognate mRNA in a sequence-specific manner, thereby inhibiting gene expression. They are naturally occurring in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes where they partake in gene regulation and defense against viral infection. The mechanisms for antisense ODN inhibition are not fully understood but it is generally considered that the ODN either sterically interferes with translation or promotes transcript degradation by RNase H activation. The earliest indication of the usefulness of antisense ODN technology for the purposes of molecular biology and medical therapy was the demonstration in 1978 that synthetic ODNs complementary to Raos sarcoma virus could inhibit virus replication in tissue cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts. Since then the antisense ODN technology has been widely used in animal sciences and as an important emerging therapeutic approach in clinical medicine. However, antisense ODN inhibition has been an under-exploited strategy for plant tissues, although the prospects for plant cells in suspension cultures to take up single-stranded ODNs was reported over a decade ago. In 2001, two reports from Malho and coworker demonstrated the use of cationic-complexed antisense ODNs to suppress expression of genes encoding pollen-signaling proteins in pollen tubes from the lilly Agapanthus umbellatus. For the uptake of DNA pollen tubes represent a unique system since the growing tip is surrounded by a loose matrix of hemicellulose and pectins, exposing the plasma membrane 7 and the first uptake of ODNs by pollen tubes was reported as early as 1994. A breakthrough in the employment of antisense ODN inhibition as a powerful approach in plant biology was recently presented through our work on intact barley leaves. As was illustrated by confocal microscopy and fluorescently labeled ODNs, naked ODNs were taken up through the leaf petiole and efficiently imported into the plant cell and the nucleus. The work portrayed in that study demonstrate the applicability of antisense ODN inhibition in plant biology, e. g. as a rapid antecedent to time-consuming transgenic studies, and that it operates through RNase H degradation. We employed the antisense ODN strategy to demonstrate the importance of the SUSIBA 2 transcription factor in regulation of starch synthesis, and to depict a possible mechanism for sugar signaling in plants and how it might confer endosperm-specific gene expression during seed development. We also described the employment of the antisense ODN strategy for studies on in vitro spike cultures of barley. Here we present further evidence as to the value of the antisense ODN approach in plant biology by following the effects on starch branching enzyme (SBE) accumulation in barley leaves after suppression of individual SBE genes. In agreement with transcript analyses of SBE expression in barley leaves, a zymogram assay (Fig. 1) revealed that sucrose treatment of barley leaves increased the number of SBE activity bands as compared to sorbitol treatment. In the presence of antisense SBEI or SBEIIA ODNs, zymograms of sucrose-treated leaves displayed only a subset of these activities with bands in the top portion of the zymogram gel missing or diminished. With antisense SBEIIB ODN, all activity bands in the top portion of the gel as well as the lowest band were absent. Based on these data we provide a tentative annotation for the various SBE activity bands. In animal experiments, naked ODNs are usually not taken up by the cells since both the ODNs and the outside of the plasma membrane carry a net negative charge. Thus the uptake of <b>naked</b> ODNs into <b>barley</b> leaf cells was surprising and called for an explanation. As demonstrated in our subsequent paper, the answer seems to be that the ODNs slip into the cells through sugar translocators as they are activated {{in the presence of the}} appropriate sugar (Fig. 2). Whether it is the structural resemblance between the sugar (deoxyribose) backbone of the ODNs and the transported sugars that allows for the ODNs to be transferred, or if other mechanisms are involved, remains to be elucidated...|$|R
