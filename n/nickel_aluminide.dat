40|$|The hot {{corrosion}} {{behavior of the}} B 2 <b>nickel</b> <b>aluminides</b> was studied to determine the inherent {{hot corrosion}} resistance of the beta <b>nickel</b> <b>aluminides</b> {{and to develop a}} mechanism for the hot corrosion of the beta <b>nickel</b> <b>aluminides.</b> The effects of the prior processing of the material, small additions of zirconium, stoichiometry of the materials, and preoxidation of the samples were also examined. Additions of 2, 5, and 15 w/o chromium were used to determine the effect of chromium on the hot corrosion of the beta <b>nickel</b> <b>aluminides</b> and the minimum amount of chromium necessary for good hot corrosion resistance. The results indicate that the beta <b>nickel</b> <b>aluminides</b> have inferior inherent hot corrosion resistance despite their excellent oxidation resistance. Prior processing and zirconium additions had no discernible effect on the hot corrosion resistance of the alloys. Preoxidation extended the incubation period of the alloys only a few hours and was not considered to be an effective means of stopping hot corrosion. Stoichiometry was a major factor in determining the hot corrosion resistance of the alloys with the higher aluminum alloys having a definitely superior hot corrosion resistance. The addition of chromium to the alloys stopped the hot corrosion attack in the alloys tested. From a variety of experimental results, a complex hot corrosion mechanism was proposed. During {{the early stages of the}} hot corrosion of these alloys the corrosion is dominated by a local sulphidation/oxidation form of attack. During the intermediate stages of the hot corrosion, the aluminum depletion at the surface leads to a change in the oxidation mechanism from a protective external alumina layer to a mixed nickel-aluminum spinel and nickel oxide that can occur both externally and internally.

Nominally, these coatings have a matrix composed of a Ni-Al based B 2 -type phase (commonly denoted as Β).

40|$|This Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) report {{deals with}} the {{development}} of <b>nickel</b> <b>aluminide</b> alloy for improved longer life heat-resistant fixture assemblies for batch and continuous pusher carburizing furnaces. The <b>nickel</b> <b>aluminide</b> development was compared in both coupon and component testing with the currently used Fe-Ni-Cr heat-resisting alloy known as HU. The specific goals of the CRADA were: (1) casting process development, (2) characterization and possible modification of the alloy composition to optimize its manufacturing ability and performance under typical furnace operating conditions, and (3) testing and evaluation of specimens and prototype fixtures. In support of the CRADA objectives, coupons of <b>nickel</b> <b>aluminide</b> and the HU alloy were installed in both batch and pusher furnaces. The coupons were taken from two silicon levels and contained welds made with two different filler compositions (IC- 221 LA and IC- 221 W). Both nickel-aluminide and HU coupons were removed from the batch and pusher carburizing furnace at time intervals ranging from one month to one year. The exposed coupons were cut and mounted for metallographic, hardness, and microprobe analysis. The results of the microstructural analysis have been transmitted to General Motors Corporation, Saginaw Division (Delphi Saginaw) through reports that were presented at periodic CRADA review meetings. Based on coupon testing and verification of the coupon results with the testing of trays, Delphi Saginaw moved forward with the use of six additional trays in a batch furnace and two assemblies in a pusher furnace. Fifty percent of the trays and fixtures are in the as-cast condition and the remaining trays and fixtures are in the preoxidized condition. The successful operating experience of two assemblies in the pusher furnace for nearly a year formed the basis for a production run of 63 more assemblies. The production run required melting of 94 heats weighing 500 lb. each. Twenty-six of the 94 heats were from virgin stock, and 68 were from the revert that used 50 % virgin and 50 % revert. Detailed chemical analysis of the 94 heats reflected that the <b>nickel</b> <b>aluminide</b> can be cast into heat-treat fixtures under production conditions.
