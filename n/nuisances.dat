The campaign cinematics, created by Blur Studio, were lauded for their outstanding animation quality.

Several <b>nuisances</b> present in the game's keyboard and mouse controls left some critics disappointed, however, enhancements made to the gamepad control scheme from the first Halo Wars were praised. Post-release, the game has been supported with additional content and updates such as support for cross-platform play. A campaign expansion, titled Awakening the Nightmare, was released in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, Barfi and Shruti meet by chance. Shruti is {{unhappy with}} her {{marriage}} {{and she and}} Barfi rekindle their friendship, much {{to the chagrin of}} the lovestruck Jhilmil, who then goes missing. Shruti files a missing person report for Jhilmil. The Darjeeling police learn about the report, resume their pursuit of Barfi and arrest him. As he is being interrogated, another ransom demand for Jhilmil is made and she is apparently killed in the process of the exchange, though her body is never found. In order to conclude the case, the police try to frame Barfi for Jhilmil's murder. Policeman Sudhanshu Dutta, who grew fond of Barfi after investigating him for his <b>nuisances,</b> asks Shruti to take him away, offering him a second chance at life. She agrees and hopes that now Jhilmil is gone, she can finally be with Barfi.|$|E

40|$|Throughout the world, mass {{development}} of native and non-native submerged macrophytes leads to <b>nuisance</b> problems for humans. However, often neither {{the type of}} <b>nuisance</b> nor the characteristics of <b>nuisance</b> vegetation have been uniformly quantified, leaving <b>nuisance</b> vegetation as a largely unsubstantiated qualification. The lack of a consensus about when submerged plants cause <b>nuisance</b> hampers comparative research on the environmental conditions leading to <b>nuisance.</b> Furthermore, defining and evaluating management goals to reduce <b>nuisance</b> caused by submerged plants are not possible when characteristics of the <b>nuisance</b> vegetation remain unquantified. In this study, we performed a literature review and gathered stakeholder information to identify (1) which problems are caused by <b>nuisance</b> submerged macrophytes, (2) which plant characteristics underlie `nuisance' and (3) and which species cause <b>nuisance.</b> We (4) synthesised this information into a framework to classify submerged vegetation as either `nuisance' or `non-nuisance' using a case study to illustrate the principles. We found that most <b>nuisance</b> problems that affect human use of the ecosystem can be grouped into problems for boat traffic, swimming, fishing and hydrological functioning of the system. Additionally, a multitude of ecological effects have also been reported, but these were outside {{of the scope of}} this study. Vegetation cover and canopy depth below the water surface are the main determinant characters for <b>nuisance.</b> Therefore, both invasive and native eutrophilic species with a vertical growth strategy are particularly problematic, but other species can also cause <b>nuisance...</b>|$|R
5|$|There is {{a general}} rule that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not liable for <b>nuisances</b> created after the occupier takes control of the land.

The state, according to Ziebold and Hagelin's attorney, was using the <b>nuisance</b> provision out of order; instead of trying and convicting the defendants first, and then subsequently declaring the property a <b>nuisance</b> on the fact of their conviction and enabling authorities to destroy the liquors, the state was instead using the <b>nuisance</b> statutes to convict the defendants without trial.

25|$|The species Lucilia cuprina, {{formerly}} named Phaenicia cuprina, is {{more commonly}} known as the Australian sheep blowfly. It belongs to the blow-fly family Calliphoridae, and while some authorities combine the blow flies (Calliphoridae) and the flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) together into the Metopiidae family, distinguishable characteristics allow for the separation. Lucilia cuprina {{is a member of the}} order Diptera, has a pair of short but very strong membranous wings and a pair of hindwings reduced and modified to clublike balancers known as halteres. This adaptation distinguishes the true flies (Diptera) from the other orders with “fly” in their name, and serves as a sensory aid that acts as tiny gyroscopes or inertial navigation system. The mesothorax is much enlarged while the prothorax and metathorax are reduced. Blow flies are about the size of a house fly or a little larger, and though considered to be <b>nuisances</b> indoors are essential agents in the breakdown of organic matter. Most are metallic blue or green, and often have black gena, mostly white calypteres and orange yellow anterior thoracic spiracles.|$|E

John Murphy, Professor of Common Law at the University of Manchester, agrees with Nolan, and makes the additional point that <b>nuisance</b> is focused on a loss of enjoyment to land, not physical damage as Rylands is.
