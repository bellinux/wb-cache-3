The Minahasan and Bolaang Mongondow are spread almost throughout the region of <b>North</b> <b>Sulawesi</b> mainland., while the Sangihe, Talaud and Siau mostly inhabit the Sangihe Islands, Talaud Island, and Lembeh Island, especially in coastal areas north, east and west of mainland <b>North</b> <b>Sulawesi.</b> The Bajau people are seafaring nomads who has migrated from the Sulu ArchipelagoÂ in theÂ Philippines, due to theÂ conflict in Mindanao.

50|$|All {{members of}} the genus were {{considered}} part of a single species until recently, the babirusa or pig-deer, B. babyrussa, but following the split into several species, this scientific name is restricted to the Buru babirusa from Buru and the Sula Islands, whereas the best-known species, the <b>north</b> <b>Sulawesi</b> <b>babirusa,</b> is named B. celebensis. The split, which uses the phylogenetic species concept, is based on differences in size, amount of hair on body and tail-tuft, and measurements of the skull and teeth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>north</b> <b>Sulawesi</b> <b>babirusa</b> has a head-and-body {{length of}} 85 - 110 cm and weighs up to 100 kg. It is {{virtually}} hairless (easily revealing its greyish skin), and the tail-tuft is also nearly hairless. In males, the relatively long and thick upper canines are strongly curved. They emerge {{through the roof}} of the snout, while the long lower canines emerge through the side of the mouth. The upper canines can grow backwards in a curve until they penetrate the skull of the male babirusa.|$|E
50|$|Its {{habitat is}} the {{underbrush}} of tropical forests and canebrakes, and {{the shores of}} rivers and lakes.

The <b>North</b> <b>Sulawesi</b> <b>Babirusa</b> is known for its two pairs of tusks; both its upper and its lower pairs of canine teeth are greatly enlarged, and curve up and back towards the head. The upper canines of the male are so curved and enlarged that they emerge through the flesh, by way of holes, to pass through the top of the snout.|$|E

50|$|Babirusa are {{notable for}} the long upper canines in the males. The upper canines of male {{babirusa}} emerge vertically from the alveolar process, penetrating though the skin and curving backward over {{the front of the}} face and towards the forehead. The lower canines also grow upwards. The canines of the female are either reduced or absent. The structure of the maleâs canines vary by species. In the golden babirusa, the upper canines are short and slender with the alveolar rotated forward to allow the lower canines to cross the lateral view. The Togian babirusa also has the same characteristics and the upper canines always converge. The <b>North</b> <b>Sulawesi</b> <b>babirusa</b> has long and thick upper canines with a vertically implanted alveolar. This caused the upper canines to emerge vertically and not cross with the lower canines. Babirusa also vary by species in other characteristics. The golden babirusa has a long, thick pelage that is white, creamy gold, black or gold overall and black at the rump. The pelage of the Togian babirusa is also long but not as that of the golden babirusa. The Togian babirusa has a tawny, brown or black pelage that is darker on the upper parts than in the lower parts. The <b>North</b> <b>Sulawesi</b> <b>babirusa</b> has very short hair and appears bald. The female babirusa has only one pair of teats.|$|E

Endemic Sulawesi birds found in Lore Lindu include the maleo (Macrocephalon maleo), purple-bearded bee-eater (Meropogon forsteni), geomalia (Geomalia heinrichi), and many others. Reptiles and amphibians include the gold snake (Elaphe erythrura and E. janseni) and Sulawesian toad (Ingerophrynus celebensis).

5000|$|The babirusas, {{also called}} babushkas or deer-pigs (babirusa) are a genus, Babyrousa, in the pig family (Suidae) found in Wallacea, or {{specifically}} the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi, Togian, Sula and Buru. All {{members of this}} genus were considered part of a single species until 2002, the babirusa, B. babyrussa, but following the split into several species, this scientific name is restricted to the Buru babirusa from Buru and Sula, whereas the best-known species, the <b>north</b> <b>Sulawesi</b> <b>babirusa,</b> is named B. celebensis. The remarkable [...] "prehistoric" [...] appearance of these mammals {{is largely due to}} the prominent upwards incurving canine tusks of the males, which actually pierce the flesh in the snout. If a babirusa does not grind its tusks (achievable through regular activity), they can eventually keep growing so as to penetrate the animal's own skull.|$|E
