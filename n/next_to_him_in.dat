25|$|Van Ronk refused {{for many}} years to fly and never learned to drive (he would use trains or buses or, when possible, recruit a girlfriend or young {{musician}} as his driver), and he declined to ever move from Greenwich Village for any extended period of time (having stayed in California for a short time in the 1960s). Van Ronk's trademark stoneware jug of Tullamore Dew was frequently seen on stage <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> his early days.|$|E
25|$|It is said by {{some that}} Zia-Junejo rift was {{encouraged}} by late Mahboob-ul-Haq and Junejo's insistence on signing Geneva pact without deciding the composition of next government of Afghanistan before Soviet withdrawal. Junejo also gave Benazir a seat <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> parleys before that. Junejo did not strengthen the Islamization drive and rather weakened it. His era led to serious disturbances in Karachi and ultimately Karachi went into the secular control of MQM from the clutches of Sunnis Jamaat-e-Islami.|$|E

25|$|Ernest Thomas {{was born}} in Tampa, Florida, the son of Ernest and Martha Thomas. When he was a child, {{his family moved to}} Monticello, Florida. He {{graduated}} from high school in Monticello and was attending Tri-State University in Angola, Indiana, studying aeronautical engineering, when he decided to enlist in the Marine Corps at Orlando, Florida. Being color blind, in order to pass the medical test allowing him to enlist, he memorized the patterns provided by a man sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the testing station.|$|E
25|$|In 1025, Conrad II {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of the Christian Western world's largest church in Speyer which was also supposed to be his last resting place. Construction began 1030 on the site of a former basilica which stood on an elevated plateau right by the Rhine but safe from high water. Along with Santiago de Compostela (begun 1075), Cluny Abbey (Cluny III, begun 1085), and Durham Cathedral (begun 1093), it was the most ambitious project of the time. The red sandstone for the building came from the mountains of the Palatine Forest and is thought to have been shipped down the channelled Speyerbach, a stream running from the mountains into the Rhine at Speyer. Neither Conrad II, nor his son Henry III, were to see the cathedral completed. Conrad II died in 1039 and was buried in the cathedral while it was still under construction; Henry III was laid <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> 1056. The graves were placed in the central aisle in front of the altar.|$|E
500|$|Once the {{legislature}} convened in 1922, the inexperience of the Premier and his caucus was further laid bare. [...] Greenfield, {{devastated by the}} sudden death of his wife, turned in a poor performance. Faced with an aggressive attack by new Liberal leader John R. Boyle, Greenfield relied heavily on Attorney General John Brownlee, who sat <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the Legislature, to provide the defense. [...] The session got off to an inauspicious start: Greenfield nominated the government's preferred candidate for speaker, Oran McPherson, only to have one of his backbenchers, Alex Moore, nominate Independent Conservative John Smith Stewart; Stewart spared the government embarrassment by declining the nomination.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the show}} mostly {{focuses on the}} three couples, their children's stories are {{followed}} too, particularly Laurie, who is attracted to her summer school philosophy teacher (Michael Rady).

500|$|On {{his first}} timed run in Q3, Hamilton failed {{to improve on}} his lap time from Q2, but was still well ahead of his teammate. However, his time was {{disallowed}} for not respecting track limits, meaning {{that he had to}} set another fast lap. Even though he slowed down in the middle sector of the lap to avoid making the same mistake again, he recorded a time just short of his earlier effort to achieve the 55th pole position of his career. Verstappen slotted into third on the grid, almost a second down on Hamilton, with his teammate Ricciardo <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> fourth. The Red Bull pair was followed by the Ferrari cars of Räikkönen and Vettel, though Vettel's grid penalty meant that he would start 11th. Carlos Sainz Jr. was eighth on the grid ahead of Hülkenberg and Alonso. Both had originally set times faster than Sainz's, but those were disallowed due to them exceeding the track limits. Following qualifying, the paddock was split in its opinion over the strict interpretation of the track limit rules. Hamilton and Hülkenberg, who both fell victim to erased lap times, supported the stewards' decision, as did Jenson Button. However, Jolyon Palmer was angered by what he called [...] "a mess" [...] and [...] "rubbish for the fans", saying that having times changed {{after the end of the}} session, as it happened in Hülkenberg's case, was [...] "confusing for fans and less enjoyable".|$|E

2500|$|He has a {{slightly}} more amicable relationship with his subordinate, the Minister's Principal Private Secretary, Bernard Woolley. He frequently lectures the naïve Woolley in the realities of political matters. When Woolley's loyalty to the Minister is inconvenient to Sir Humphrey's plans, he readily makes oblique threats about Woolley's job prospects should he defy Sir Humphrey. However, he is equally quick to defend Woolley from outsiders. His closest on-screen friendships are with Sir Arnold Robinson, Cabinet Secretary during Yes Minister; Sir Frederick [...] "Jumbo" [...] Stewart, Permanent Secretary of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; and the banker Sir Desmond Glazebrook. He is married, although his wife plays virtually no role in either series and is only seen once: <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> bed in the Series One episode [...] "Big Brother".|$|E

5|$|Z. Marcas is a novelette by French author Honoré de Balzac first {{published}} in 1840.

Destitute and forgotten, he befriends a pair of students who live <b>next</b> door <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a boarding-house. The story follows their many discussions about the political situation in France.|$|R

Mr. Boncassen, who was <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> asked, <b>in</b> irony probably rather than in ignorance, whether the victory was to be achieved by mathematical or classical proficiency. Gerald turned and looked at him. [...] "Do you mean to say that you have never heard of the University boat-races?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Edward died at Westminster Palace and {{is buried}} at Canterbury Cathedral. He {{requested}} {{to be buried}} in the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral rather than next to the shrine, and a chapel was prepared there as a chantry for him and his wife Joan, Countess of Kent (this is now the French Protestant Chapel; it contains ceiling bosses of her face and of their coats of arms). However, his wishes were over-ruled after his death, and he was buried {{on the south side of}} the shrine of Thomas Becket, behind the quire. Further, the expectation that his wife Joan would be buried <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity of the chantry, was also belied; she chose in her will to be buried beside her first husband, and was interred accordingly at Greyfriars (the site of the present hospital) in Stamford, Lincolnshire.|$|E
2500|$|A {{tradition}} {{recorded in}} 1693 is that Hathaway [...] "greatly desired" [...] {{to be buried}} with her husband. In fact she was interred in a separate grave <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon. The inscription states, [...] "Here lyeth the body of Anne wife of William Shakespeare who departed this life the 6th day of August 1623 being {{of the age of}} 67 years." [...] A Latin inscription followed which translates as [...] "Breasts, O mother, milk and life thou didst give. Woe is me– for how great a boon shall I give stones? How much rather would I pray that the good angel should move the stone so that, like Christ's body, thine image might come forth! But my prayers are unavailing. Come quickly, Christ, that my mother, though shut within this tomb may rise again and reach the stars." [...] The inscription may have been written by John Hall on behalf of his wife, Anne's daughter, Susanna.|$|E

He accepted this as an omen, and determined that to Madeira he would go.

60|$|I will do Mr. Hastings {{the justice}} to say, that, {{if he had}} known there was another man more {{accomplished}} in all iniquity than Gunga Govind Sing, {{he would not have}} given him the first place in his confidence.

Very awkwardly, Nicosia sits down at his place {{at the dinner table}} near a very naked Count Dragalescu and his bevy of naked women.
