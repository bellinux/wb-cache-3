5|$|In 2012, {{researchers}} announced {{findings that}} sublethal exposure to imidacloprid rendered honey bees significantly {{more susceptible to}} infection by the fungus <b>Nosema,</b> thereby suggesting a potential link to CCD, given that <b>Nosema</b> is increasingly considered to contribute to CCD.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees are {{parasitised}} by tracheal mites, Locustacarus buchneri; protozoans including Crithidia bombi and Apicystis bombi; and microsporidians including <b>Nosema</b> bombi and <b>Nosema</b> ceranae. The tree bumblebee B. hypnorum {{has spread}} into the United Kingdom despite hosting {{high levels of}} a nematode that normally interferes with queen bees' attempts to establish colonies. Deformed wing virus {{has been found to}} affect 11% of bumblebees in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Some have {{suggested}} the syndrome {{may be an}} inability by beekeepers to correctly identify known diseases such as European foulbrood or the microsporidian fungus <b>Nosema</b> apis. The testing and diagnosis of samples from affected colonies (already performed) makes this highly unlikely, as the symptoms are fairly well known and differ from what is classified as CCD. A high rate of <b>Nosema</b> infection was reported in samples of bees from Pennsylvania, but this pattern was not reported from samples elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, {{scientists}} from the University of Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture found {{that a combination of}} pesticides has been contaminating the pollen bees use to feed their hives. When researchers collected pollen from hives on the east coast, they discovered that it was contaminated (on average) with 9 different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different agricultural chemicals in one sample of pollen. Eight ag chemicals were identified to be associated with increased risk of infection by <b>Nosema</b> ceranae.|$|E
5|$|N. ceranae {{has been}} {{detected}} in honey bees from several states using PCR of the 16S gene. In New York, N. ceranae was detected in 49 counties, {{and of the}} 1,200 honey bee samples collected, 528 (44%) were positive for <b>Nosema,</b> from which, PCR analysis of 371 spore positive samples revealed 96% were N. ceranae, 3% had both N. ceranae and N. apis, and 1% had N. apis only.|$|E
5|$|The fungal {{pathogen}} Metarhizium acridum {{is found}} in Africa, Australia and Brazil where it has caused epizootics in grasshoppers. It is being investigated for possible use as a microbial insecticide for locust control. The microsporidian fungus <b>Nosema</b> locustae, once {{considered to be a}} protozoan, can be lethal to grasshoppers. It has to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a bait-based commercial microbial pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.|$|E
5|$|Contract {{pollination}} has overtaken {{the role}} of honey production for beekeepers in many countries. From 1972 to 2006, feral honey bees declined dramatically in the US, and they are now almost absent. The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through urbanization, systematic pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as colony collapse disorder. In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus <b>Nosema</b> ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination. Winter losses increased to about 1/3. Varroa mites {{were thought to be}} responsible for about half the losses.|$|E
5|$|The first {{silkworm}} diseases {{began to}} appear in 1845, creating an epidemic. Among them are pébrine, caused by the microsporidia <b>Nosema</b> bombycis, grasserie, caused by a virus, flacherie, caused by eating infected mulberry leaves or white muscardine disease, caused by the fungus Beauveria bassiana. The epidemic grew to a massive scale, and after having attacked the silkworms, other viruses began to infect the mulberry trees. The chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, French minister of agriculture, was charged with stopping the epidemic. In face of sericulturers' call for help, he asked Louis Pasteur to study the disease, starting in 1865. For many years, Pasteur thought that pébrine was not a contagious disease. In 1870 he changed his view, and measures were enacted that caused the disease to decline.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nosema</b> {{disease is}} treated by {{increasing}} the ventilation through the hive. Some beekeepers treat hives with antibiotics such as fumagillin.|$|E
25|$|Black {{queen cell}} virus causes the queen larva to turn black and die. It {{is thought to}} be {{associated}} with <b>Nosema.</b>|$|E
500|$|When healthy {{bees are}} fed pollen filled with fungicides, {{insecticides}} and other agriculture chemicals, {{they are more}} likely to be infected by <b>Nosema</b> ceranae, a parasitic microsporidian fungus associated with widespread death of honey bees. [...] Hives of western honey bees infected with <b>Nosema</b> ceranae are wiped out within eight days indicating that CCD may be caused by N. ceranae. A research team claim to have ruled out many other potential causes, however, a 2009 survey of US CCD-affected bee populations found only about half of the colonies sampled, both in CCD and control populations, were infected with N. ceranae.|$|E
500|$|The WSU {{work also}} {{focused on the}} impact of the microsporidian {{pathogen}} <b>Nosema</b> ceranae, the build-up of which was high in the majority of the bees tested, even after large doses of the antibiotic fumagillin. Penn State's Dr. Maryann Frazier said, [...] "Pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of CCD. We believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors, possibly including mites, viruses and pesticides." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, N. ceranae was {{reported}} in a few hives in California. [...] The researcher did not, however, believe this was conclusive evidence of a link to CCD; [...] "We don't want to give anybody the impression that this thing has been solved". A USDA bee scientist has similarly stated, [...] "while the parasite <b>Nosema</b> ceranae may be a factor, it cannot be the sole cause. The fungus has been seen before, sometimes in colonies that were healthy".|$|E
500|$|The primary {{antifungal}} agent used against <b>Nosema</b> is fumagillin, {{which has been}} used in a German research project to reduce the microsporidian's impact, and is mentioned as a possible remedy by the CCDWG. Higes also claims to have successfully cured colonies with fumagillin. A review of these results described these results as promising, but cautioned [...] "N. ceranae may not be to blame for all cases of colony collapse". Various areas in Europe have reported this fungus, but no direct link to CCD has yet been established.|$|E
500|$|The {{second annual}} Steering Committee report was {{released}} in November 2010. The group reported that although many associations—including pesticides, parasites, and pathogens—had been identified {{throughout the course of}} research, [...] "it is becoming increasingly clear that no single factor alone is responsible for [...] ". Their findings indicated an absence of damaging levels of the parasite <b>Nosema</b> or parasitic Varroa mites at the time of collapse. They did find an association of sublethal effects of some pesticides with CCD, including two common miticides in particular, coumaphos and fluvalinate, which are pesticides registered for use by beekeepers to control varroa mites. Studies also identified sublethal effects of neonicotinoids and fungicides, pesticides that may impair the bees' immune systems and may leave them more susceptible to bee viruses.|$|E
500|$|In 2008 {{high levels}} of the {{pesticides}} fluvalinate and coumaphos were found in samples of wax from hives, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides. These chemicals {{have been used to}} try to eradicate varroa mites, a bee pest that itself has been thought to be a cause of CCD. A 2009 study confirmed {{high levels of}} pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between the pesticide and reduced bee longevity. <b>Nosema</b> ceranae, was found in high concentrations in the majority of the bees tested, even after administering large doses of the antibiotic fumagillin. Maryann Frazier commented, [...] "Pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of CCD. We believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors, possibly including mites, viruses and pesticides." ...|$|E
500|$|Grasshoppers {{can best}} be {{prevented}} from becoming pests by manipulating their environment. Shade provided by trees will discourage them {{and they may be}} prevented from moving onto developing crops by removing coarse vegetation from fallow land and field margins and discouraging luxurious growth beside ditches and on roadside verges. With increasing numbers of grasshoppers, predator numbers may increase, but this seldom happens sufficiently rapidly to have much effect on populations. Biological control is being investigated, and spores of the protozoan parasite <b>Nosema</b> locustae can be used mixed with bait to control grasshoppers, being more effective with immature insects. [...] On a small scale, neem products can be effective as a feeding deterrent and as a disruptor of nymphal development. Insecticides can be used, but adult grasshoppers are difficult to kill, and as they move into fields from surrounding rank growth, crops may soon become reinfested.|$|E
500|$|A University of Montana and Montana State University team of {{scientists}} headed by Jerry Bromenshenk {{and working with the}} US Army's Edgewood Chemical Biological Center published a paper in October 2010 saying that a new DNA virus, invertebrate iridescent virus type 6 (IIV-6), and the fungus <b>Nosema</b> ceranae [...] were found in every killed colony the group studied. In their study, they found neither agent alone seemed deadly, but a combination of the virus and N. ceranae was always 100% fatal. Information about the study was released to the public in a front page article in The New York Times. A few days later, an article was published in Fortune Magazine with the title, [...] "What a scientist didn't tell the New York Times about his study on bee deaths". Professor of entomology at Penn State University James Frazier, who was researching the sublethal impact of pesticides on bees, said that while Bromenshenk's study generated some useful data, Bromenshenk has a conflict of interest as CEO of a company developing scanners to diagnose bee diseases. A few months later, the methods used to interpret the mass spectrometry data in the Bromenshenk study were called into question, raising doubts as to whether IIV-6 was ever correctly identified in any of the samples examined.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nosema</b> apis is a microsporidian that invades the {{intestinal}} tracts of adult bees and causes <b>nosema</b> disease, {{also known as}} nosemosis. [...] <b>Nosema</b> infection is also associated with black queen cell virus. [...] It is normally only a problem when the bees cannot leave the hive to eliminate waste (for example, during an extended cold spell in winter or when the hives are enclosed in a wintering barn). [...] When the bees are unable to void (cleansing flights), they can develop dysentery.|$|E
2500|$|... and genetically {{modified}} crops with pest-control characteristics. In 2010, US researchers announced they had identified a co-infection of invertebrate iridescent virus type 6 (IIV-6) and <b>Nosema</b> ceranae in all CCD colonies sampled.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, {{a similar}} type of {{organism}} to N. apis was discovered on the Asian honey bee Apis cerana and subsequently named <b>Nosema</b> ceranae. [...] This parasite apparently also infects the western honey bee.|$|E
2500|$|Exposure to corn pollen {{containing}} {{genes for}} Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) production may weaken the bees' defense against <b>Nosema.</b> In relation to feeding {{a group of}} bees with Bt corn pollen and a control group with non-Bt corn pollen: ...|$|E
2500|$|Pebrine is {{a disease}} caused by a {{parasitic}} microsporidian, <b>Nosema</b> bombycis Nageli. Diseased larvae show slow growth, [...] undersized, pale and flaccid bodies, and poor appetite. Tiny black spots appear on larval integument. Additionally, dead larvae remain rubbery and do not undergo putrefaction after death.|$|E
2500|$|Applying proteomics-based {{pathogen}} screening {{tools in}} 2010, researchers announced they had identified a co-infection of an iridovirus; specifically invertebrate iridescent virus type 6 (IIV-6) and <b>Nosema</b> ceranae in all CCD colonies sampled. On {{the basis of}} this research, the New York Times reported the colony collapse mystery solved, quoting researcher Dr. Bromenshenk, a co-author of the study, [...] " [...] are both present in all these collapsed colonies." [...] Evidence for this association, however, remains minimal [...] and several authors have disputed the original methodology used to associate CCD with IIV-6.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933 the Nazi regime {{passed the}} Civil Service Law, {{requiring}} all public servants to provide proof of Aryan ancestry. Frisch {{was unable to}} account for the ancestry of one of his grandparents, and was therefore classified as a mischling of 1/8th Jewish ancestry, but formally allowed to keep his job. However groups of students and lecturers worked to have him dismissed from the university, preferring a committed National Socialist. Frisch also attracted negative attention for employing Jewish assistants, including many women, and for practicing [...] "Jewish science". Eventually Frisch was forced into retirement, but the decision was reversed due to advances in his research on combating <b>nosema</b> infections in bees and his forced retirement was postponed until after the war. Frisch also worked actively to help Polish scientists who had been singled out for internment by the Gestapo.|$|E
