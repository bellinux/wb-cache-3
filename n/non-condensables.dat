Deaeration can be {{accomplished}} by using deaerators heaters, vacuum deaerators, mechanical pumps, and steam-jet ejectors. In deaerating heaters steam sprays incoming feed water and carries away the dissolved gases. The deaerators also store hot feed water which is ready {{to be used in the}} boiler. This means of mechanical deaeration is also used with chemical oxygen scavenging agents to increase efficiency. (Sendelbach, p. 129) Deaerating heaters can be classified in to two groups. The two deaerating heaters are spray types and tray types. With tray type deaerating heaters the incoming water is sprayed into steam atmosphere in order to reach saturation temperature. When the saturation temperature is reached most of the oxygen and non-condensable gases are released. There are seals that prevent the recontamination of the water in the spray section. The water then falls to the storage tank below. The <b>non-condensables</b> and oxygen are then vented to the atmosphere. The components of the tray type deaerating heater are a shell, spray nozzles, direct contact vent condenser, tray stacks, and protective interchamber walls. The spray type deaerater is very similar to the tray type deaerater. The water is sprayed into a steam atmosphere and most of the oxygen and <b>non-condensables</b> are released to the steam. The water then falls to the steam scrubber where the slight pressure loss causes the water to flash a little bit which also helps with the removal of oxygen and <b>non-condensables.</b> The water then overflows to the storage tank. The gases are then vented to the atmosphere. With vacuum deaeration a vacuum is applied to the system and water is then brought to its saturation temperature. The water is sprayed in to the tank just like the spray and tray deaeraters. The oxygen and <b>non-condensables</b> are vented to the atmosphere.(Sendelbach, p. 130) ...|$|E

The two main devices that are used to eliminate the non-condensable gases with a cycle operating with sub-atmospheric fluids are steam jet air ejectors (SJAE) and liquid ring vacuum pumps.

The performance of the heat pipe is investigated at three different amounts of both heat input and mass of <b>non-condensable</b> gas (air). The wall temperatures distribution along the heat pipe using the water-based CuO nanofluid is lower than that of the heat pipe using DI water.

A series of developmental thermosyphons were operated at nominal operating temperature with accelerated gamma irradiation exposures on the same order of magnitude that is expected in eight years of heat rejection system operation. Temperature data were obtained during exposure at three locations on each thermosyphon; evaporator, condenser, and condenser end cap.

40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons of the {{discrepancies}} between theoretical predictions made by models of absorbers of H 2 O-LiBr absorption chillers when they are compared with experimental results under real conditions is the presence of <b>non-condensables</b> gases. These <b>non-condensables</b> gases are inside the shell of the absorption chiller mainly for two reasons: i) air leakages (Oxygen-Nitrogen); ii) gases produced by corrosion (Hydrogen). A mathematical model of falling film absorption of H 2 O by LiBr aqueous solutions which considers the influence of non-condensable gases has been implemented. The model is semi-empirical, based on Navier Stokes equations together with energy and mass species simplified under the boundary layer hypotheses. Under such conditions, the differential system of equations in partial derivatives, becomes parabolic and could be solved by means of finite difference method in a step by step procedure. Detailed heat and mass transfer balances are applied at the interface to specify the boundary conditions between liquid and gas phases. In order to calculate gradient of air at the interface, the penetration theory is applied in order to avoid a detailed calculation of the gas phase.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{presence}} of <b>non-condensable</b> gases inside a compression vapour refrigerating circuit introduces an additional thermal resistance at the condenser, which can significantly decrease the energy efficiency of the system. However, this problem so far has been investigated mainly for shell and tube condensers of large capacity and limited information is available on small systems, as is the case for household appliances where the internal volumes are extremely reduced and therefore a very small amount of <b>non-condensable</b> gas has large effect. Moreover, <b>non-condensable</b> gas behaves differently when condensation takes place outside tubes (shell and tube condensers) or inside tubes (condensers of small appliances); in the first case all heat transfer area is wrapped by a gas layer, whereas in the second case <b>non-condensable</b> gas is collected {{at the end of the}} tube.

In this work, a high quality bio-oil has been produced using a novel approach where flash pyrolysis, catalysis and fractionation of pyrolysis vapors using two stage condensation are combined in a single process unit. A bench scale unit of 1 kg/h feedstock capacity is used for catalytic pyrolysis in an entrained down-flow reactor system equipped with two-staged condensation of the pyrolysis vapor. Zeolite-based catalysts are investigated to study the effect of varying acidities of faujasite Y zeolites, zeolite structures (ZSM 5), different catalyst to biomass ratios and different catalytic pyrolysis temperatures. Low catalyst/biomass ratios did not show any significant improvements in the bio-oil quality, while high catalyst/biomass ratios showed an effective deoxygenation of the bio-oil. The application of zeolites decreased the organic liquid yield due to the increased production of <b>non-condensables,</b> primarily hydrocarbons. The catalytically produced bio-oil was less viscous and zeolites were effective at cracking heavy molecular weight compounds in the bio-oil. Acidic zeolites, H-Y and H-ZSM 5, increased the desirable chemical compounds in the bio-oil such as phenols, furans and hydrocarbon, and reduced the undesired compounds such as acids. On the other hand reducing the acidity of zeolites reduced some of the undesired compounds in the bio-oil such as ketones and aldehydes.

The sugarcane bagasse was torrefied in TGA and in a custom designed thermogravimetric reactor {{for the evaluation of}} big particles in the temperature ranges of 200 - 300 °C. With TGA tests, kinetic parameters representative of the material decomposition were obtained, and with large particles tests, the degradation was compared when the amount and particle size of material increases. The products of all torrefied tests were characterized and compared. Poplar wood was torrefied in a custom thermogravimetric reactor in order to determine its kinetic parameters and in a two-stage rotary reactor by varying the operating parameters. These experimental tests with poplar were carried out in the circulating fluidized bed laboratory of Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada. In the rotary reacctor, the biomass is dried in the first stage, and then torrefied in the second. Torrefaction process is carried out under volatiles atmosphere generated during the process, without inlet of inert gases. Fine particles, between 0. 5 and 1 mm in diameter were used in this study, and characterized before and after torrefaction. A characterization of the biomass being torrefied was performed using two novel scooper devices for sample capture from inside reactor, specially designed for this research. These two devices allow to capture biomass samples being torrefied and measuring their temperatures in different axial positions of the reactor. Two phenomenological models were constructed: a two-dimensional model for torrefaction of a biomass particle and a two-stage rotary reactor model. Both were duly validated and great information was obtained from them. A kinetic scheme involving secondary reactions to the interior of the biomass particle was used and validated with experimental information. Four phases were considered in the model: Biomass, water, char and gases, and for each of them it was possible to obtain distributions of their volumetric fractions {{at any time in the}} process. In addition, temperature distributions, velocities of volatiles generated and pressures can be obtained. A vertical reactor was designed and built in order to evaluate the behavior of large particles in torrefaction process. With this reactor, it is possible to follow the mass and temperature of the particle during the process. In addition, it is possible to capture volatiles and separate them into condensables and <b>non-condensables</b> throught a condensation unit which operates at - 15 °C and capture the condensable portion of the volatiles stream. With this reactor, it is possible to perform a complete characterization of all torrefation products such as liquid, gas and solid. This reactor was designed and built by the TAYEA group, specifically for the realization of this research work...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is part of an overall effort to develop an evaluator of fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) tools of vapor compression systems (Yuill and Braun, 2012). The evaluator needs a large database of performance data of systems under both faulted and non-faulted conditions. The types of faults include non-standard charging, heat exchanger fouling, compressor flow fault, liquid line restriction and presence of non-condensable. However, conducting experiments to build the database is expensive and time-consuming. Empirical modeling may induce data outside the applicability domain of the model in the database. Forward modeling of vapor compression systems requires many details of the systems that may be unavailable. It may also require multiple tuning methods with experimental data for accuracy. Consequently, inverse modeling, where parameters of models are trained from experimental data directly without detailed knowledge of systems, is chosen to construct the models and to generate the database in this project. ^ Although models have been developed for simulating faulted impacts on vapor compression systems, they are not quick enough to generate the database and do not cover all faults studied by the evaluator (Rossi, 1997; Harms, 2002; Shen, 2006). These models also require detailed specification of the systems in addition to the tuning of heat transfer coefficients and other models for accurate simulation. However, inverse modeling approaches need less knowledge of the system than the empirical approach and fewer tuning procedures and less time to build than the forward approach. It is also capable to simulate all the faults investigated by the evaluator and satisfies the needs of the evaluator. ^ Data from eleven cooling systems tested by different parties were collected. These systems were tested under various types of faults such as non-standard charging, heat exchanger fouling, compressor flow fault, liquid line restriction and presence of <b>non-condensables.</b> Semi-empirical component models were developed with data filtering to avoid predicting unrealistic outcomes. Weighted parameter estimation was carried out during the training process to reduce the effect of imbalanced test matrices on the coefficients. The leverage of the parameter estimation result and the range of training data were also studied to define the applicability domain of the models. Component models were joined together to form a system model. A quasi-Newton method and a constrained optimization algorithm were used to solve the system model with good speed and robustness. An existing charge tuning method was modified to increase the accuracy of charge inventory estimation. The final simulation results were validated with experimental data by comparing estimated performance variables with the experimental data and predicted changes of performance with the measured changes of performance with fault level. The validated simulation was used to study the impacts of different faults on different types of sample systems (an fixed orifice (FXO) system, an FXO system with an accumulator and a thermostatic expansion valve (TXV) system) by plotting the change of coefficient of performance, evaporator heat transfer rate, compressor power consumption and SHR with increasing fault level. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{modelling}} of condensation {{in presence}} of <b>non-condensable</b> gases {{is of relevance}} {{for the design of}} passive containment cooling condenser of the third generation of Passive Nuclear Power Plants.

In this model we take into account the influence of the <b>non-condensable</b> gases over the liquid side heat transfer without any iteration to calculate the liquid-steam interfacial temperature. The trick is to perform a set of Taylor expansions for the main physical magnitudes as viscosity, steam mass fraction and so on. We also consider the interfacial shear stress exerted by the steam-non-condensable mixture flow over the condensate layer thickness. The calculation of the condensate layer thickness can be performed {{with the help of the}} mass, energy and momentum conservation equations and can be achieved without any iteration following the method of Munoz-Cobo et al [1, 2]. The new proposed mechanistic model solves explicitly the real interfacial temperature by means of a cubic or a quartic equation depending on the degree of approximation that has been chosen.
