25|$|The {{majority}} of Ghanaian women deliver {{at home with}} a traditional birth attendant and are referred to the hospital in cases of complicated labor. Although most deliveries are attended by a traditional birth attendant, most women prefer to deliver with a health professional. Barriers to obtaining professional health care include high costs, inadequate transportation, long distances to health care facilities, and poor road conditions. Some women were also too embarrassed to go to a hospital because they did not have <b>nice</b> <b>clothes</b> and preferred to deliver at home where no one could see that they were poor.|$|E
500|$|When first {{presenting}} the original {{story to the}} rest of his team, Shinkai learned that Yukari had unintentionally come across as selfish. To remedy this, he gave her character nervous traits and personality flaws, such as letting her emotions spill over during mildly upsetting events. [...] Shinkai later realized that some of these personality quirks and temporary professional challenges seen in Yukari were present in a former girlfriend, for whom he had written his short film She and Her Cat. In addition to making Yukari's character more convincing, these character flaws also made it more difficult to plan since she had to be both flawed and attractive to a young boy. One aspect of her character that Shinkai focused on was her appearance. He felt that she had to be dressed in <b>nice</b> <b>clothes,</b> and particularly nice shoes. In order to balance realism with fashion, he researched shoemaking, worked with a clothing coordinator and stylist, and held weekly fashion meetings with his staff.|$|E
6000|$|Alton, who {{appeared}} a trifle perturbed, sat down, {{and glanced at}} the partly finished meal upon the table disgustedly. [...] "Tell them to take those things away, and bring me something a man can eat. Then I want my long boots and the <b>nicest</b> <b>clothes</b> I have." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{young fellow}} laughed. [...] "Oh yes, you do," [...] he said, not unamiably, and he added, [...] "and you've {{got the right}} to. We're not fit to {{associate}} with you, and you know it, and we know it. You've got more money, and you've got <b>nicer</b> <b>clothes,</b> and you've got prettier manners. You talk about things that most natives never heard of, and you care for things they never saw. I know it's the custom to pretend differently, but I'm not going to pretend differently." ...|$|R
50|$|Third attempt: The man {{catches the}} {{newspaper}} and gets dressed faster and into <b>nicer</b> <b>clothes</b> than on his previous attempts. He also takes his wallet and an umbrella with him. Rather than trying to {{put his arm around}} his date, he keeps his hands to himself until she grabs his hand to get closer to him. When the food is thrown at the club, he uses his umbrella to block it and save her. When he takes her {{home at the end of}} the night, she pulls him into her house.|$|R
2500|$|Burns went to England {{to visit}} his friend Barry Gibb. Gibb, with his male assistant, picked up Burns at the airport. Burns recalled, [...] "Barry always {{impressed}} me.

2500|$|Chester Alan Arthur II was {{the second}} son of Ellen Lewis Herndon and Chester A. Arthur. Ellen was the {{daughter}} of explorer William Lewis Herndon. He was born on July 25, 1864 in New York City. His elder brother William Lewis Herndon Arthur, was born in December 1860, named after Ellen's father, and died in July 1863 from convulsions or swelling of the brain. It was particularly difficult for Nell, her husband wrote, [...] "Nell is broken hearted. I fear for her health." [...] Feeling as if they had [...] "taxed" [...] William's brain with [...] "intellectual demands", they pampered their second son, who [...] "led a life that closely resembled that of European royalty." [...] He wore <b>nice</b> <b>clothes,</b> learned to sail and ride, and was taught charm and vanity. His parents had somewhat of a laissez-faire attitude about his academics.|$|E
5000|$|Horne's grandson, the English writer Robert Farrar, {{describes}} Horne as [...] "school-of-Moliere, a pleaser, {{an artist}} of the depression and the war years whose brief was to make an audience feel safe and loved. You could put on your <b>nicest</b> <b>clothes,</b> turn up at the theatre and know beyond {{a shadow of a}} doubt that you were going to have good time." [...] At age 15, after reading his grandfather's stageplays, Farrar wrote and produced his first stage play, Drawing-Room Tragedy; the performance, at Farrar's school, was shortly after Horne's death.|$|R
50|$|A closet by {{definition}} {{is a small}} space used to store things. In a bedroom, a closet is most commonly used for clothes and other small personal items that one may have. Walk in closets are more popular today and vary in size. However, in the past wardrobes {{have been the most}} prominent. A wardrobe is a tall rectangular shaped cabinet that clothes can be stored or hung in. Clothes are also kept in a dresser. Typically <b>nicer</b> <b>clothes</b> are kept in the closet because they can be hung up while leisure clothing and undergarments are stored in the dresser.|$|R
500|$|Mary Ashford, a {{young woman}} of about 20years of age, worked as a general servant and {{housekeeper}} to her uncle, a farmer at Langley Heath, Warwickshire, between Birmingham and Sutton Coldfield. Her father was a gardener near Erdington. She worked as usual on 26 May 1817, and planned to attend a party that evening at The Three Tuns, a public house more {{commonly known as the}} Tyburn House. The party was an [...] "annual club-feast and dance", which attracted a large attendance. She met her friend, Hannah Cox, left her work clothes at Cox's house in Erdington (after having obtained <b>nicer</b> <b>clothes</b> from her mother's house in the same village) and journeyed to the Tyburn House, arriving there at 7:30 to find the dancing already begun.|$|R
2500|$|Outhwaite has {{suggested}} that the wardrobe department struggled {{to come up with a}} static identity for Melanie at first; however, this she felt turned out to be a good thing: [...] "What I really liked about it was, when we started looking for costumes , the wardrobe department couldn't quite fit where I was going. I'd wear Army pants and trainers some days and then jeans some other days and then I'd be all suited and booted at other times. I said, 'That's what girls do! That's how I am. Some days I'm in scruffs and some days I'm really dressed up. It would be really nice to have a character who's not so predictable.'" [...] Rosalind Powell, head of the EastEnders wardrobe design team in 2000, said that Mel had [...] "colourful and stylish" [...] wardrobe from retailers such as Kookai and Oasis. Powell added, [...] "Although she's a barmaid, she can still afford to wear <b>nice</b> <b>clothes,</b> she just doesn't have a very big wardrobe." ...|$|E

5000|$|Junior tennis was {{the first}} of several {{obstacles}} Casals faced during her tennis career. At five-feet-two-inches tall, {{she was one of the}} shortest players on the court. Another disadvantage for her was class distinction. Traditionally, tennis was a sport practiced in expensive country clubs by the white upper class. Casals's ethnic heritage and poor background immediately set her apart from most of the other players. [...] "The other kids had <b>nice</b> tennis <b>clothes,</b> <b>nice</b> rackets, nice white shoes, and came in Cadillacs," [...] Casals told a reporter for People. [...] "I felt stigmatized because we were poor." ...|$|R
5000|$|The word Izikhothane is a slang {{word that}} {{originates}} from the Zulu word [...] "Osikhotheni". Osikhotheni means {{people who live}} in the bushes/bundus, and that is derived from the Zulu word [...] "Isikhotha" [...] that means [...] "bush". The singular form of this Zulu word is called [...] "usikhotheni". This term is township slang for hustlers who live a lavish life style (<b>nice</b> expensive <b>clothes,</b> <b>nice</b> cars, etc) without having a job or owning a business. You can call them modernised beggars who live by using illegal ways to satisfy their hunger for their lavish life styles.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the rice}} season, villagers {{celebrate}} by marching in a procession to the pagoda. This is a chance for everyone to relax after the long labor of the harvest season. As well, it provides an opportunity to have fun and bond with the community. All the villagers wear their <b>nicest</b> <b>clothes,</b> musicians sing and dance, and men take the opportunity to court young women. Upon arrival, believers circle the temple three times and then proceed to present gifts such as clothing, dishes, furniture, and food. These donations, named Kathen by Buddha, provide help for bonzis, who in turn give blessings. This act of donation is essential in accumulating good karma for reincarnation, so eventually to reach Nirvana, or ultimate salvation, as well as for future harvests.|$|R

50|$|Sumire is an {{aspiring}} writer who survives {{on a family}} stipend and the creative input of her only friend, the novel's male narrator and protagonist, known in the text only as 'K'. K is an elementary school teacher, 25 years old, and in love with Sumire, though she does not quite share his feelings. At a wedding, Sumire meets an ethnic Korean woman, Miu, who is 17 years her senior. The two strike up a conversation, and Sumire finds herself attracted to the older woman. This {{is the first time}} she has ever been sexually drawn to anybody. Miu soon asks Sumire to come work for her. This meeting and the ensuing relationship between the women leads to Sumire changing: she starts wearing <b>nicer</b> <b>clothes,</b> gets a better apartment, and quits smoking; however, she also develops a writer's block.|$|R
50|$|A {{woman named}} Betty (Fannie Ward) {{is simple and}} plain, her husband finds that boring and doesn't invite her out. She decides she needs to wear <b>nicer</b> <b>clothes</b> to get the {{attention}} of her husband.

50|$|Charlie, who is {{steadily}} growing to like Rusty {{as compared to}} their grandmother (she seems much more pleasant), does not like his father and believes that 'Uncle Harvey' (whom we never meet, but was Peggy's 'friend' during the War; there are doubts from Rusty whether her Mother was only just his friend at certain points of the book) is his real father {{as he was told}} his real father would play with him, which Roger does not. One day, when Peggy is called away because a friend from Devon has problems, Rusty is left looking after Charlie. Rusty's grandmother asks her if she would like to get dressed in <b>nicer</b> <b>clothes</b> than her jeans and have tea with her and her friend. Rusty agrees but, coming down, she is curious where Charlie is, and is told he was taken for a treat by their Father. Rusty is a bit uncertain as she spots his teddy on the floor and Charlie never goes anywhere without it.|$|R
60|$|Bessy {{had been}} tempted to run the arduous race, partly from mere hedonish gaiety, {{partly because of the}} prize.

But {{since the war}} come on, I tell you, I ain't kicking, I {{can go to a}} movie or the theatre once in a while, and buy <b>nice</b> <b>clothes,</b> and I don't get so tired as I used to.

500|$|Pollin largely {{agrees with}} Todd, speculating that Imlay saw Percy Shelley in Bath and he [...] "somehow failed her", {{causing her to}} commit suicide. Seymour and others {{speculate}} that Shelley's only failure was {{to live up to}} his financial promises to Godwin and it was this that helped push Imlay over the edge; she was convinced, like her father, [...] "that the worthy have an absolute right to be supported by those who have the worth to give". Todd, on the other hand, agrees with Pollin and speculates that Imlay went to see Mary Godwin and Shelley. Todd argues that Imlay had affection for Shelley and felt that his home was her only haven. Relying on scraps of poetry that Shelley may have written after Imlay's death, Todd concludes that Shelley saw her in Bath and rejected her pleas because he needed to protect Claire's reputation as well as his own at this time. Todd also notes that Imlay had worn her mother's stays, which were embroidered with the initials [...] "M.W.", and the <b>nicest</b> <b>clothes</b> she owned. She had adorned herself with a Swiss gold watch sent to her from Geneva by the Shelleys and a necklace, in order to make a good impression. After Shelley rejected her, Todd concludes, Imlay decided to commit suicide.|$|R

I would ask you, however, to consider my appearance I have been obliged to conclude the last few miles of my journey in somewhat ignominious fashion.

60|$|Uncle Tom {{felt that}} he was indeed very {{fortunate}} to have found such a kind master and so good a home. He had <b>nice</b> <b>clothes,</b> plenty of food, and a comfortable room to sleep in. He had no hard, disagreeable work to do. His chief duties were to drive Mrs. St. Clare's carriage when she wanted to go out, and to attend on Eva when she wanted him. He soon grew to love his little mistress very, very much indeed.|$|E

Fred was ranting mad--said he wanted a boy--when the truth is he didn't want it at all. If {{it had been a}} boy he'd have ranted because it wasn't a girl. They had four girls and three boys before, so I can't see that it made much difference what this one was, but of course he'd have to be cantankerous, just like a man. The baby is real pretty, dressed up in its <b>nice</b> little <b>clothes.</b> It has black eyes and the dearest, tiny hands." ...|$|R
