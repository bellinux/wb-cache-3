25|$|The {{sequence}} of events that eventually resulted in Bristol Rovers leaving the city and playing their home games in Bath during the 1980s began in 1932, when Rovers agreed a lease of Eastville Stadium to the Bristol Greyhound Racing Association that included a clause stating that if Rovers were to sell the stadium then the greyhound association would have first refusal, and that the price would not exceed £13,000. In 1934 the lease was amended to allow the Bristol Greyhound Racing Association to buy the stadium whenever they wished to purchase it, providing that they gave two months <b>notice</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> to the football club. The purchase price was guaranteed to be not less than £8,000 and not more than £13,000. In 1939, Rovers wrote to the greyhound company informing {{them that they were}} prepared to sell the stadium, the greyhound company replying with an offer of £20,000 for the freehold.|$|E

2500|$|Svyret opposed {{proposals}} for the Limited Liability Partnerships (Jersey) Law 1997, which {{was sponsored by}} two UK accountants firms. During the debate, Syvret stated [...] "Senator Jeune has, {{in his capacity as}} President of the Policy and Resources Committee, used his influence to speed up the Law Drafting process and get this matter brought through. He has spoken on this matter in the House and at Committee meetings, even though he has a financial interest in this matter". Reginald Jeune was a founding partner in one of Jersey's largest law firms Mourant, du Feu & Jeune. [...] That firm was engaged by two accounting firms from the UK to assist them in getting this controversial law on the Statute book. Reginald Jeune had stood down as a partner for the law firm several years previously. It was not disputed that he was engaged as a Consultant by the law firm, and continued to have an office and secretary in the firms headquarters. He claimed {{that he did not know}} that his law firm was acting for Price Waterhouse, that his position in the law firm was an honorary one, and that his office and secretarial support from that law firm were to assist him in his States work. These claims were never investigated. The Bailiff Sir Philip Bailhache, as presiding officer of the States assembly, subsequently wrote to Syvret, referring to the standing order which stated [...] "No Member shall impute improper motives to any other Member", saying [...] "you have not provided me with any evidence to justify those imputations", inviting Syvret to discuss the matter, and giving notice that matter would be put to the States assembly after the summer recess. At the States assembly on 3 September 1996, Syvret refused to withdraw his statement, and was not allowed to speak. Members voted by 36 to 3 (with 4 abstentions) in favour of the proposition [...] "That Mr. Syvret be suspended from the service of the States until he has withdrawn, by <b>notice</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> to the Greffier, his imputations of improper motives against Senator Jeune". In an interview shortly afterwards, Syvret told The Observer, [...] "I was not allowed to defend myself. This is like something out of George Orwell's 1984.... I was not allowed to defend myself, to speak on my behalf". UK MP Austin Mitchell described the States of Jersey's conduct in the matter as that of a [...] "legislature for hire" [...] and he sponsored an Early Day Motion in the UK Parliament critical of Syvret's suspension. The States of Jersey subsequently agreed to set up a committee of inquiry into procedural matters relating to the drafting of the legislation. On 4 March 1997, Svyret returned to address the States assembly and stated that he alleged only that Senator Jeune had breached Standing Orders 43 and 44 of the States of Jersey. As Syvret had not alleged improper motives against Senator Jeune he therefore could not withdraw an allegation which he had not made; Syvret left the States meeting and the States then resolved to censure him but to lift his suspension. In April 1998, Michael Beloff QC, sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court, struck out legal proceedings brought by Syvret challenging the legality of his suspension from the States assembly on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction over the legislature's internal procedures.|$|E
6000|$|Padre Giacomo, to whose great {{kindness}} I am indebted for a biographic {{and critical}} <b>notice</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> of Father Pakraduni, considers the epic poem by that scholar {{a far greater}} work {{than any of his}} philological treatises, profound and thorough as they are. When nearly completed, this poem perished in the same conflagration which consumed the Pindar and the Rhetoric; but the poet patiently began his work anew, and after eight years gave his epic of twenty books and twenty-two thousand verses to the press. The hero of the poem is Haïk, the first Armenian patriarch after the flood, and the founder of a kingly dynasty. Nimrod, the great hunter, drunk with his victories, declares himself a god, and ordains his own worship throughout the Orient. Haïk refuses to obey the commands of the tyrant, takes up arms against him, and finally kills him in battle. [...] "In the style of this poem," [...] writes Padre Giacomo, [...] "it is hard to tell whether to admire most its richness, its energy, its sweetness, its melancholy, its freedom, its dignity, or its harmony, for it has all these virtues in turn. The descriptive parts are depicted with the faithfulest pencil: the battle scenes can only be matched in the Iliad." ...|$|E

In it he states that Napoleon may have abdicated but he will continue the war while any member of Napoleon's family sits on the French throne, that if Paris is attacked there will be immense destruction [...] "for you know what liberties the exasperated soldiers would take, should your capital be carried by storm", but if he is allowed into Paris he will [...] "protect the respectable inhabitants against the mob, by whom they are threatened with pillage".|$|R
