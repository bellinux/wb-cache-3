40|$|Dinitrogen pentoxide (N₂O₅), {{a primary}} <b>nocturnal</b> <b>reservoir</b> for NOx (NOx [equivalence] NO + NO₂), readily {{undergoes}} heterogeneous reaction on aqueous interfaces. These reactions potentially alter the chemical, physical, and hygroscopic properties of ambient particles, and ultimately their climate impact. Upon reacting with aqueous chloride-containing surfaces, such as sea spray, nitryl chloride (ClNO₂) is produced. ClNO₂ {{is capable of}} extending the lifetime of NOx and inducing ozone production in high NOx environments via chlorine radical creation. The extent to which N₂O₅ reactivity impacts atmospheric oxidant loadings depends on the heterogeneous reaction rate of N₂O₅ with a given surface. This, in turn, is directly influenced by interfacial chemical composition, morphology, and phase state. In this dissertation, I describe advances {{in the understanding of}} how organic and inorganic constituents at atmospheric interfaces regulate N₂O₅ reactivity. First, I developed an observation-based framework for assessing the aerosol particle mixing state role on N₂O₅ heterogeneous reaction kinetics using simultaneous measurements of the N₂O₅ reactive uptake coefficient to ambient aerosol with direct measurements of aerosol mixing state before and after reaction. Second, as part of the NSF Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment, I extended the use of a novel Marine Aerosol Reference Tank (MART) capable of generating nascent sea-spray aerosol, to determine heterogeneous reaction kinetics. Here, the MART was doped with ocean organic mimics to assess how organics present in the sea surface microlayer (SSML), and subsequently ejected into sea-spray, impact N₂O₅ reaction kinetics. Third, I conducted laboratory studies to investigate suppressed ClNO₂ production rates at the ocean surface, using ambient seawater from various locations and under varied biological conditions, along with model sea salt solutions with proxy organics. This study was designed to determine the role of unsaturated organics and surface-enhanced inorganic ions in the SSML in altering ClNO₂ production rate...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen oxides are {{ubiquitous}} {{throughout the}} lower atmosphere and significantly affect {{the chemistry of}} the atmosphere, air quality, and climate. A data-set obtained using {{differential optical absorption spectroscopy}} (DOAS) was analyzed in order to quantify the NO 3, HONO and NO 2 concentrations at Saturna Island, and concentrations of N 2 O 5 were calculated. Nocturnal measurements of NO 3, NO 2 and HONO were also performed using active-DOAS at York University. A method for calculating the lifetimes of NO 3 without assuming a steady-state approximation was determined and non steady-state lifetimes of NO 3 were calculated for both studies. The direct (via NO 3) and indirect (via N 2 O 5) rate loss constants of NO 3 from the combined <b>nocturnal</b> <b>reservoir</b> (NO 3 +N 2 O 5) were determined as a function of time of night. Measurements of HONO over the polluted open ocean were performed for the first time. Rapidly established steady-states of HONO were observed, persisting throughout the night until sunrise. During the steady-state period (d[HONO]/dt≈ 0), HONO was independent of the air mass source and NO 2, leading to a zero-order HONO formation with respect to NO 2, contrary to expectations. Potential reservoirs of HONO were explored and a conceptual model for HONO formation over aqueous surfaces was hypothesized. Subsequently, nocturnal measurements of HONO in the urban area were made at York University for a total of 242 nights. This urban data-set showed two types of HONO behavior. Firstly, a steady-state behavior was clearly observed for a subset of the data-set, similar to that observed in the aqueous environment at Saturna. Secondly, HONO concentrations were observed to highly correlate with NO 2 for another subset of the data-set (d([HONO]/[NO 2]) /dt≈ 0), showing evidence of first-order behavior as expected for the accepted heterogeneous NO 2 hydrolysis mechanism of HONO formation (2 NO 2 + H 2 O → HONO + HNO 3). Steady-states of HONO were observed during atmospherically unstable nights, while HONO was strongly correlated with NO 2 during stable nights. It was discovered that the main parameters distinguishing these two types of behavior were atmospheric stability and NO 2 concentration...|$|E
40|$|Schistosoma japonicum, a multi-host parasite, remains highly endemic in China and has {{recently}} re-emerged in previously controlled regions. One reason may be, {{given the current}} human- and bovine-based control policy, due to {{a serious lack of}} knowledge of the potential role for other species of mammals, including dogs, cats and small rodents, in the transmission. This thesis aims to contribute to our understanding of transmission dynamics of S. japonicum by investigating the implications of different reservoirs in the transmission across two contrasting geographical regions/settings: the marshland with the disease persistence versus the hilly region where the disease was once controlled. Longitudinal characterization of S. japonicum infection at both definitive host and intermediate host levels was performed throughout 2006 - 2007, with the highest prevalence and infection intensity observed in rodents in the hilly region and in the agriculturally important domestic animals (cattle and goats) in the marshland. Three chronobiological trials of cercarial emergence were performed to identify any host (with nocturnal vs diurnal activity) -associated biological traits of the parasite. A late afternoon shedding pattern was observed in the hilly region, compatible with a <b>nocturnal</b> rodent <b>reservoir,</b> and a morning-afternoon dual shedding pattern within marshland areas, consistent with a diurnal bovine major reservoir. Characterization of the parasite population genetic diversity, using microsatellite markers, at both larval stages, also indicated cattle to be the main definitive host reservoir species in the marshland, which was further confirmed by sibling relationship analyses. In the hilly regions, however, epidemiological, biological and molecular data indicated that, in addition to the role of rodents as the main reservoirs to maintain the disease, dogs, with their higher mobility, may also {{play a significant role in}} S. japonicum transmission in these areas. The implications of these results, in terms of parasite strain sub-structuring and targeted disease control, were discussed.

40|$|Continuous {{automatic}} {{data recording}} and periodic water sampling {{were carried out}} in dual purpose reservoirs (fish farming and crop irrigation). The study {{was carried out in}} the Israeli coastal area and in the Jordan Valley, at two sites in each reservoir - windward (west) and leeward (east) - and at several depths per site. Shallow reservoirs (about 3 - 4 m deep) developed a daily pattern of thermal and oxygen stratification with full <b>nocturnal</b> mixing. Deep <b>reservoirs</b> (5 - 8 m deep) developed, in addition to the daily pattern at the upper layers (2 - 3 m), a seasonal stratification. This {{led to the formation of}} an anoxic hypolimnion which lasted until midseason when the water level decreased to about 5 m due to irrigation. The daily wind (west sea breeze) induced movement of the upper oxygenated layer eastward. This layer downwelled in the east of the reservoir and the subsurface layer upwelled in the west, leading to a horizontal oxygen gradient in which the dissolved oxygen concentration in the east was higher and reached a greater depth than in the west. Differences in weather between the geographic locations led to stronger stratification in the Jordan Valley. Implications for reservoir management and differences from other types of water bodies are discussed...|$|R
