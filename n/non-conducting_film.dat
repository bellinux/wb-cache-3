40|$|The first {{successful}} production of fluorine electrolytically {{was carried out}} by H. Moissan (1). He electrolysed anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, to which potassium hydrogen fluoride had been added to render it conducting. A platinum U-tube was used as a container, the openings being closed with fluorite stoppers in which platinum-iridium electrodes were set. Later he found a copper container to be satisfactory, but platinum electrodes were necessary, copper electrodes being unsuitable due to the formation of a <b>non-conducting</b> <b>film</b> of copper fluoride. He cooled the container with chloromethane to prevent excessive loss of hydrogen fluoride due to the heat generated by the passage of the electrolytic current. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} of the electrical properties of the systems based on polyethylene glycol and carbon nano-tubes near-by the percolation threshold is done using the method of impedance spectroscopy. It is estab-lished that the percolation threshold for these systems is 0, 5 %, and critical index t  1, 17. It is discovered that <b>non-conducting</b> polymeric <b>film</b> appears between separate nanotubes. The thickness of the film which is 7 - 8 Å and its contact resistance which is 3 • 105 Ohm were derived using theoretical models. This explains a difference in conductivity of pure nanotubes and probed system after the percolation threshold...|$|R

40|$|Polyaniline (PANI) {{belongs to}} a group of {{conducting}} polymers that show numerous properties useful in biomedical applications. Although PANT has long been studied in terms of interaction with human tissue, the published studies are mostly focused on composites of polyaniline with other polymers, not allowing for generalization of the obtained results. The present study is focused on the adhesion of human liver cells to a conducting and <b>non-conducting</b> polyaniline <b>films.</b> The ability of human liver cells to attach to both types of the tested surfaces was confirmed. Cell proliferation on the PANI surfaces was monitored in relation to material biocompatibility and to its practical applications. The results showed statistically significant differences in cell proliferation {{depending on the type of}} PANT film. The study thus points out the need to test materials in their neat forms, which allow for better generalization of the test results leading to their broader applications...|$|R
40|$|A glucose biosensor, {{based on}} glucose oxidase immobilized in a <b>non-conducting</b> (overoxidised) {{polypyrrole}} <b>film,</b> is described which proved practically immune from faradaic interference arising from endogeneous (ascorbate, urate, cysteine) and exogeneous (acetaminophen) electroactive interferents. The bias {{introduced in the}} measurement of 5 mM glucose by the given interferents at their maximum physiological levels never exceeded 2 % which is, by far, the lowest value ever reported. The biosensor {{has been used for}} continuous subcutaneous monitoring of glucose in a rabbit implanted with a microdialysis probe. The potential and limits of this approach are discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Non-conducting</b> {{polymeric}} <b>films</b> synthesised by the electrooxidation of o-aminophenol on a platinum electrode in acetate or {{phosphate buffer}} displayed an interesting permselective behaviour, which proved valuable in minimising the electrochemical interferences from ascorbate, acetaminophen, cysteine and urate sample molecules in amperometric detection mode. The electrosynthesis of poly(o-aminophenol) film showed also useful as permselective membrane for enzyme immobilization {{as demonstrated by}} the production of an interference-free glucose oxidase biosensor. In this respect, the glucose response time, t 0. 95, evaluated in batch addition experiments, was lower than 5 s while the calibration curve was linear up to 10 mM of glucose with a sensitivity of 69. 7 nA/mM. Both the permselective behaviour and the enzyme-entrapping property of the film were critically compared with the relevant studies until now reported. With respect to the sophisticated but complex approaches described elsewhere, this study shows that simply a proper optimization of p(oAP) electrosynthesis and its permselective behaviour is the key to improve significantly the selectivity of the resulting analytical devices...|$|R
40|$|Electrodeposition is {{an enzyme}} {{immobilization}} method {{based on the}} well-known electrophoretic phenomena of proteins {{under the influence of}} an electrical field. In the original method, the enzyme is mixed to a collagen dispersion at a pH value different from their isoelectric points to form macromolecular complexes which migrate to, and deposit on, an electrode surface held at an appropriate electric potential. In spite of the interest of such a method, quite similar to the enzyme entrapment in electrosynthesized polymers, the so-called "electrochemical immobilization", up to now few papers have been devoted on this subject. These studies do not deal with the understanding of both chemical and electrochemical processes involved in protein electrodeposition, which are particularly significant for the proper development of biosensors. For example, a study of a suitable electrochemical technique, able to control the protein deposition while minimizing the undesirable but collateral faradaic processes (i. e. O 2 evolution), cannot be found in the relevant literature. More important, the realization of an useful biosensor, free of interference and fouling problems (which arise in real matrices analysis) has not yet been achieved with this approach. The electrodeposition method, herewith called "electrophoretic protein deposition" (EPD), has been investigated in our laboratory with the aim to develop a novel approach in amperometric biosensor realization. The influence of some chemical and electrochemical parameters on the protein deposition has been studied with several electrochemical methodologies. Galvanodynamic and potentiodynamic techniques have been compared in terms of membrane quality, thickness and spatial control of protein deposition. An electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance study permitted further insights about the growth of proteic deposit on the electrode surface. The enzyme electrodes so obtained have been further characterized to realize the feasibility of EPD procedure for the development of an useful biosensor. In this respect, the realization of amperometric biosensors using the hybrid approach has been drawn out to this novel enzyme immobilization procedure. In particular, EPD of co-crosslinked bovine serum albumin/glucose oxidase membranes coupled with electrosynthesized <b>non-conducting</b> <b>films</b> of poly- 2 -naphthol or poly-o-aminophenol permitted the realization of glucose biosensors with anti-interference and anti-fouling performances so interesting to assure a future employment for real sample analysis...|$|R
40|$|The electrooxidation of 2 -naphthol in {{phosphate}} buffer at pH 7 {{leads to the}} formation of a non-conducting polymer of poly(2 -naphthol) on a platinum electrode. Such a resulting thin film displays an interesting permselective behaviour, which proved useful in minimising the interference of ascorbate, acetaminophen, cysteine and urate sample molecules. Electrochemical detection in flowing streams was used to investigate the relevance of permselectivity for sensor development. <b>Non-conducting</b> poly(2 -naphthol) <b>film</b> demonstrated useful also as a novel permselective membrane for glucose oxidase immobilization.

40|$|The {{commercial}} {{development of a}} disposable aqueous chlorine sensor based on a novel microelectrode array fabrication process is described. <b>Non-conducting</b> poly(o-phenylenediamine) <b>films</b> are firstly used to passivate conductive surfaces. Ultrasonic ablation of passivated electrode assemblies then results {{in the formation of}} a plurality of wells to expose the underlying conductive substrate, thereby forming a microelectrode array. Microelectrode arrays produced in this manner can be exploited within many electrochemical sensing applications; however, portable aqueous chlorine detection has been selected by Microarray Limited (the industrial sponsors of this project) as a primary vehicle for launching its generic production technology. The scale of microelectrode array production has been extended from that of individual gold sputtercoated glass slide electrodes - to the simultaneous production of hundreds of low-cost screen printed carbon-ink based sensors. A focus has been directed at all stages towards permitting the cost-effective large-scale mass production of sensors with a view to challenging existing portable aqueous chlorine measurement technologies both in terms of performance and unit cost. Based on volume batches of 250, 000, it has been calculated that Microarray Limited sensors can be manufactured for a unit cost of approximately 2. 5 pence, sufficiently low to provide scope for a competitive yet profitable sale price. The Microarray Limited aqueous chlorine detection system has improved the limit of detection from 0. 01 ppm to 0. 005 ppm total chlorine without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, this novel approach to aqueous chlorine detection offers numerous key benefits to the customer including reduced testing time, a more straightforward operation and the elimination of harmful reagents. Product development has been described from an initial concept through to a pre-production phase. The development of an innovative generic sensor packaging technology is also described.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis, carried out at the Analytical Group of the Faculty of Industrial Chemistry in Bologna, {{is to develop a}} new {{electrochemical}} method for the determination of the Antioxidant Capacity (AOC). The approach is based on the deposition of a <b>non-conducting</b> polymeric <b>film</b> on the working electrode surface and the following exposition to the radicals OH· produced by H 2 O 2 photolysis. The strongly oxidant action of hydroxyl radicals degrades, causing an increase of the Faradic current, relevant to the redox couple [Ru(NH 3) 6] 2 +/ 3 + monitored by cyclic voltammetry(CV); the presence of an antioxidant compound in solution slows down the radical action, thus protecting the polymeric film and blocking the charge transfer. The parameter adopted for the quantification of the AOC, was the induction time, called also lag phase, which is the time when the degradation of the film starts. Five pure compounds, among most commonly antioxidant, were investigated : Trolox®(an analogue water-soluble of vitamin E), (L) -ascorbic acid, gallic acid, pyrogallol and (-) - epicatechin. The AOC of each antioxidant was expressed by TEAC index (Trolox® Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity), calculated from the ratio between the slope of the calibration curve of the target compound and the slope of the calibration curve of Trolox®. The results from the electrochemical method, have been compared with those obtained from some other standardized methods, widely employed. The assays used for the comparison, have been: ORAC, a spectrofluorimetric method based on the decrease of fluorescein emission after the attack of alkylperoxide radicals, ABTS and DPPH that exploit the decoloration of stable nitrogen radicals when they are reduced in presence of an antioxidant compound and, finally, a potentiometric method based on the response of the redox couple [Fe(CN) 6] 3 -/ [Fe(CN) 6] 4 -. From the results obtained from pure compounds, it has been found that ORAC is the methodology showing the best correlation with the developed electrochemical method, maybe since similar radical species are involved. The comparison between the considered assays, was also extended to the analysis of a real sample of fruit juice. In such a case the TEAC value resulting from the electrochemical method is higher than those from standardized assays...|$|R
