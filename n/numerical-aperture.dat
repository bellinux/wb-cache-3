40|$|We report on, in this letter, a {{phenomenon}} that the central zerointensity point of a doughnut beam, caused by phase singularity, disappears in the focus, when such a beam is focused by a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective in free space. In addition, the focal shape of the doughnut beam of a given topological charge exhibits the increased ring intensity in the direction orthogonal to the incident polarization state and an elongation in the polarization direction. These phenomena are caused by the effect of depolarization, associated with a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective, and become pronounced {{by the use of}} a central obstruction in the objective aperture...|$|E
40|$|In modern optical microscopy, a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> {{objective}} {{plays an}} important rule for high-resolution imaging and laser trapping. However, a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective results in a depolarisation process [1]. As a result, a linear polarised beam is depolarised into three components of the electromagnetic wave in the focal region. One of the components is along {{the direction of the}} beam propagation, i. e. along the axial direction. The contribution of the longitudinal component can be enhanced if the incident illumination over the lens aperture is centrally obstructed. As a result, the focal spot in free space is split into two peaks with a separation determined {{by the size of the}} obstruction [2]. Another feature caused by the longitudinal component is that the recently predicted spectral splitting phenomenon near phase singularities of focused waves [G. Gbur, T. D. Visser and E. Wolf, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 013901 (2002) ] disappears when the numerical aperture is higher than critical values that are different between the incident polarization direction and the axial direction [3]. If the phase of the field over the lens aperture is also apodised, the focal shape of a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective becomes more complicated. For example, when the phase over the lens aperture possesses a helical structure, i. e. when the illumination on the lens has a screw optical singularity, the doughnut focal shape, which occurs for a low <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective, does not necessarily exist when the numerical aperture is large [4]. In this presentation, the new features mentioned above will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in laser direct writing with a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective is the severe axial focal elongation and the pronounced effect of the refractive-index mismatch aberration. We present the simultaneous compensation for the refractive-index mismatch aberration and the focal elongation in three-dimensional laser nanofabrication by a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective. By the use of circularly polarized beam illumination and a spatial light modulator, a complex and dynamic slit pupil aperture can be produced to engineer the focal spot. Such a beam shaping method can result in circularly symmetric fabrication along the lateral directions {{as well as the}} dynamic compensation for the refractive-index mismatch aberration even when the laser beam is focused into the material of a refractive index up to 2. 35.

40|$|Reported in {{this letter}} is a {{phenomenon}} that the focal spot of a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective in free space can split into two spots if a ring beam is used for illumination. Diffraction by a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective results in a depolarization such that the diffracted field in the focal region includes not only a component with the same polarization as the incident beam, but also orthogonal and longitudinal components. The use of a ring beam enhances the relative contribution from the longitudinal component. As a result, a single focal spot splits into two spots along the incident polarization direction. It is revealed theoretically that for an objective of given numerical aperture there is a threshold of the central obstruction size of a ring beam for {{the appearance of a}} two-peak focus...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{trapping}} {{is based}} on the radiation pressure on a small particle in the focal region of a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective. Currently, the focal spot of a trapping beam is elongated along the longitudinal direction and thus the axial size of the trapping volume is approximately three times larger than that in the transverse direction. We report on a laser trapping technique under focused evanescent wave illumination. Therefore laser trapping of micro/nano-objects can be achieved in the near-field region with an axial trapping size of approximately 60 nm, which is reduced by approximately one order of magnitude. Hence, this technique is of significant importance in nanometry including single molecule detection and manipulation...|$|E
40|$|Diffraction-limited non-Airy {{multifocal}} arrays {{are created}} by focusing a phase-modulated vortex beam through a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective. The modulated phase at the back aperture of the objective resulting from the superposition of two concentric phase-modulated vortex beams allows for the generation of a multifocal array of cylindrically polarized non-Airy patterns. Furthermore, we shift the spatial positions of the phase vortices to manipulate the intensity distribution at each focal spot, leading {{to the creation of}} a multifocal array of split-ring patterns. Our method is experimentally validated by generating the predicted phase modulation through a spatial light modulator. Consequently, the spatially shifted circularly polarized vortex beam adopted in a dynamic laser direct writing system facilitates the fabrication of a split-ring microstructure array in a polymer material by a single exposure of a femtosecond laser beam...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} {{three-dimensional}} optical trapping of metallic Mie particles using an obstructed laser beam.

The axial trapping force of {{the three types of}} metallic particles is maximized in the near-infrared wavelength region. The maximum axial trapping efficiency increases with the size of the center obstruction and the aperture angle of an objective. Axial trapping force on Mie metallic particles is enhanced by a factor of two if an obstructed doughnut (TEM-mode) beam is employed.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new type of total {{internal}} reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) called scanning TIRFM (STIRFM) that uses a focused ring-beam illumination and a high-numerical-aperture objective (NA = 1. 65). The evanescent field produced by the STIRFM is focused laterally, producing a small excitation volume that can induce a nonlinear effect such as two-photon absorption. Experimental images of CdSe quantum dot nanocrystals and Rhodamine 6 G-doped microbeads show that good lateral and axial resolutions are achieved with the current setup. The theoretical simulation of the focal spot produced in STIRFM geometry shows that the focused evanescent field is split into two peaks because of the depolarization effect of a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective lens. However, the point-spread function analysis of both one-photon and two-photon excitation cases shows that the detection of the focus-splitting effect is dependent on the detection pinhole size.

Here, two-photon polymerization is extended to the fabrication of macroscopic structures by making use of medium <b>numerical-aperture</b> microscope objectives. By introducing a substrate holder movable in the axial direction {{it is possible to}} keep the focusing conditions constant and to fabricate very large structures with heights that are not limited by the working distance of the objective. Moreover, the constant focusing conditions enable us to quantify spherical aberrations by experimental mapping of the optical point-spread function, which manifests itself in the shape of singe photo-polymerized voxels. By monitoring such shapes it is possible to minimize aberrations.

However, the first approach requires the use of elaborate collection optics, while the latter is based on accurate positioning of the quantum emitter near complex nanoscale architectures; hence, sophisticated fabrication and experimental capabilities are needed. Here, we present a theoretical and experimental demonstration of a planar optical antenna that beams light emitted by a single molecule, which results in increased collection efficiency at small angles without stringent requirements on the emitter position.

40|$|We studied both {{theoretically}} and experimentally {{the intensity}} distribution of a Gaussian laser beam {{when it was}} focussed by an objective lens with its <b>numerical-aperture</b> (NA) up to 0. 95. Approximate formulae for full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of the intensity distribution at focus were derived for very large and very small initial beam waists {{with respect to the}} entrance pupil radius of the objective lens. In experiments the energy flux through a 0. 5 micron pinhole was measured for various pinhole positions. We found that the FWHM's at focus in the transverse and the longitudinal directions do not increase much from the ultimate FWHM's until the input beam waist is reduced below the half of the entrance pupil radius. In addition, we observed significance of the spatial distribution of the input beam against a true Gaussian beam profile in the case of small initial beam waist. For high NA with resulting focal beam waists comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of the laser, the interaction between the electric field and the conducting surface of the pinhole caused the transverse FWHM to be measured slightly smaller than FWHM of the unperturbed intensity distribution convoluted with the pinhole opening.

Here we develop the first reflection-mode submicron-resolution PAM system with a new compact design.

This socalled "quantum size effect" {{can be understood}} with the energy level structures of the quantum dots, and the multiphoton spectroscopy has already {{proven to be a}} powerful technique for probing energy levels of quantum dots [1]. The research at the Centre for Micro-Photonics (CMP) has been focusing on the multiphoton imaging and spectroscopy of individual nanocrystal under near-field and far-field illuminations. Recently, the CMP has developed a novel near-field scanning fluorescence microscopy called scanning total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (STIRFM), which utilizes a focused ring-beam illumination and a high <b>numerical-aperture</b> objective (NA = 1. 65) to produce highly confined evanescent focus. The high-level confinement of the evanescent field could induce nonlinear processes such as multiphoton excitation.

The two-photon and three-photon excitation cross sections of nanocrystals are also measured, which reveal the energy level structure of nanocrystals. In this talk, we will present the recent research results of multiphoton excitation of nanocrystals at the CMP.

In theory, x-ray microscopes can image unsectioned hydrated cells with nanometer resolution. In practice, however, the resolution of x-ray microscopes is limited to approximately 20 nm due to difficulties {{in the construction of}} high <b>numerical-aperture</b> (NA) x-ray focusing optics. This thesis represents a step on a new path to nanometer resolution in x-ray microscopy by proposing and demonstrating scanning standing-wave illumination (SWI) microscopy. In scanning SWI microscopy, lensless focusing is achieved with the interference of large numbers of phase-aligned planar wavefronts. Resolution is determined primarily by the NA synthesized by the planar wavefronts, circumventing the need for high-NA optical components. Both theoretical and experimental work conducted at visible wavelengths is presented. An electromagnetic theory of image formation in scanning SWI fluorescence microscopy is developed. The point spread function is remarkably well-suited to Fourier analysis and can be analyzed using graphical techniques. Phase alignment is accomplished by maximizing the intensity of light scattered or fluoresced by a point-like particle using an iterative algorithm that is guaranteed to converge monotonically. A prototype scanning SWI microscope with 15 phase-modulated linearly-polarized laser beams arranged in a 0. 95 -NA radially-polarized circular cone and a 0. 25 -NA objective lens is presented.

40|$|Three {{applications}} of Smith's model of magneto-optical effects in stratified magnetic media are presented. Each application involves the incident-angle dependence of magneto-optical effects which Smith's model treats explicitly. In addition. the three applications address current issues in magnetic and magneto-optical recording. The first problem considered {{is that of}} nonmagnetic surface layers which form on magnetic recording heads. The second is a theoretical treatment of effects which arise in magneto-optical recording when high <b>numerical-aperture</b> optical systems are combined with media exhibiting interference-enhanced optical properties. The final application is a novel technique for determining the entire dielectric tensor of materials used for magneto-optical recording. The incident-angle dependence of the longitudinal Kerr effect is employed to study nonmagnetic surface layers which form on ferrite recording heads. Calculations based on the Smith model show a correlation between the inert-layer thickness and the incident-angle dependence of the longitudinal Kerr effect. Experimental results confirm the shift in the angular position of the signal peak. {{in agreement with the}} theory for finite inert-layer thickness. An unambiguous determination of the inert-layer thickness for ferrite materials is prevented because of a periodic dependence of the peak angle on the inert-layer thickness. Jones-matrix algebra is used with the Smith model to quantitatively determine the effects of obliquely-incident rays on the reflectance and magneto-optical readout signals for various magneto-optical media structures. The most antireflective structure is found to be very sensitive to incident-angle effects. Structures with moderate reflectance (> 10 %). however. are not significantly affected by incident-angle effects. Finally. a technique for the determination of the optical and magneto-optical constants from multiple incident-angle measurements of reflectance and Kerr rotation is presented. The experimental system employs a Helium-Neon laser and a rotating differential detection system. The technique is used to investigate the optical properties of a series of Cu/Co multilayers and a comparison with a model based on the bulk optical. constants of Cu and Co is made.
