25|$|Senior vice {{president}} Gary Schultz and Athletic Director Tim Curley {{were found to}} be <b>not</b> <b>credible</b> by the grand jury.

25|$|Both {{groups were}} met with heavy legal {{opposition}} from the Australian government, with Commonwealth representatives contending that those making claims were opportunistically trying to blame a single incident {{for a range of}} life problems and had fabricated or embellished their symptoms, or were otherwise making <b>not</b> <b>credible</b> claims. By May 2008, 35 cases were still ongoing, two from dependants of Voyager sailors killed in the collision, the remainder from Melbourne sailors. A further 50 cases had been closed in 2007 following mediation. The final of 214 compensation cases related to the incident was closed in July 2009. Some cases had been open for more than ten years, costing the government {{millions of dollars a year}} in legal costs.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{official}} version released by the Spanish government, the withdrawal was due to bad weather, an excuse <b>not</b> <b>credible,</b> given that the weather conditions in the Mediterraneanare favorable to navigation in the summer. Among the measures used to present the bombing as a success, the most significant was that of numerous promotions among the participants. The Spanish 'victory' was sung by numerous poems, most of them exaggerated and of bad taste, but in fact nothing had been achieved. Two months later, five Algerian privateers captured two Spanish merchant vessels near Palamós {{as a gesture of}} defiance, and a new, far bigger expedition had to be assembled to attack Algiers again the following year.|$|E

25|$|At 2123 Jellicoe {{was passed}} a {{position}} report from 2100 of the rearmost {{section of the}} German fleet, on course due south. The position was wrong due to German navigation errors, although the course had been correct at that time. The position was <b>not</b> <b>credible</b> as it placed the German ship south of his own position {{at the time he}} received the intercept, contrary to reports from his own ships of German positions, and the result was to increase his distrust in such intercepts. Jellicoe stated afterwards that he would always trust a report from one of his own ships rather than an intercept, although other analysis later demonstrated that these reports too contained errors or could be misleading.|$|E
25|$|Falk et al. (2007) offered further {{evidence}} that the claims of a microcephalic H.sapiens were <b>not</b> <b>credible.</b> Virtual endocasts of an additional nine microcephalic brains and ten normal human brains were examined, and {{it was found that}} the floresiensis skulls are similar in shape to normal human brains, yet have unique features which are consistent with what one would expect in a new species. The frontal and temporal lobes of the floresiensis brain were found to be highly developed, in strong contrast to the microcephalic brain, and advanced in ways different from modern human brains. This finding also answered past criticisms that the floresiensis brain was simply too small to be capable of the intelligence required for the members of H.floresiensis to create the tools found in their proximity. Falk et al. (2007) conclude that the onus is now upon the critics that continue to claim microcephaly to produce a brain of a microcephalic that bears resemblance to the floresiensis brain.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{relations}} between Noriega and the United States began to deteriorate. In 1986, U.S. President Ronald Reagan opened negotiations with General Noriega, requesting that the Panamanian leader step down {{after he was}} publicly exposed in The New York Times by Seymour Hersh, and later exposed in the Iran-Contra Scandal. Reagan pressured him with several drug-related indictments in U.S. courts; however, since extradition laws between Panama and the U.S. were weak, Noriega deemed this threat <b>not</b> <b>credible</b> and did not submit to Reagan's demands. In 1988, Elliot Abrams {{and others in the}} Pentagon began pushing for a U.S. invasion, but Reagan refused, due to Bush's ties to Noriega through his previous positions in the CIA and the Task Force on Drugs, and their potentially negative impact on Bush's presidential campaign. Later negotiations involved dropping the drug-trafficking indictments. In March 1988, Noriega's forces resisted an attempted coup against the government of Panama. As relations continued to deteriorate, Noriega appeared to shift his Cold War allegiance towards the Soviet bloc, soliciting and receiving military aid from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Libya. American military planners began preparing contingency plans to invade Panama.|$|E

500|$|Dr. William Boone, {{political}} science professor at Clark Atlanta University, said drug influence should not have been cause for prosecutors to dismiss the threat, and that drugs have historically caused criminals to follow through with such crimes and schemes. Boone said, [...] "The whole idea of just dismissing it as <b>not</b> <b>credible</b> is incredible. ... It’s surprising given the whole history of crime and drug use in the United States." ...|$|E
500|$|No {{specific}} {{details of the}} workings of the claimed technology were made public. McCarthy stated in a 2006 RTÉ radio interview, [...] "What we have developed is a way to construct magnetic fields so that when you travel round the magnetic fields, starting and stopping at the same position, you have gained energy". In 2011, Steorn's website was updated to suggest that the Orbo is based on magnetic fields which vary over time. Barry Williams of the Australian Skeptics has pointed out that Steorn is [...] "not the first company to claim they have suddenly discovered the miraculous property of magnetism that allows you to get free energy" [...] while Martin Fleischmann says that it is <b>not</b> <b>credible</b> that positioning of magnetic fields could create energy.|$|E
500|$|Allegations {{regarding}} {{the treatment of}} Afghan detainees resurfaced in November 2009 via parliamentary testimony by Richard Colvin, the second highest-ranked member of Canada’s diplomatic service in Afghanistan from 2006 to 2007. Colvin claimed that many detainees were probably tortured, {{and it was a}} standard operating procedure for Afghan interrogators. This would be consistent with special reports by the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the US Department of State. Colvin also said the torture involved beatings, whipping with power cables, the use of electricity, knives, open flames and rape. The Canadian government dismissed opposition calls for a public inquiry the next day. [...] "There has not been a single, solitary proven allegation of abuse involving a transferred Taliban prisoner by Canadian forces", Defence Minister Peter MacKay said in the House of Commons, with his parliamentary secretary suggesting Colvin was <b>not</b> <b>credible.</b>|$|E

500|$|According to legend, Achaius, King of Scots (possibly {{coming to}} the aid of Óengus mac Fergusa, King of the Picts), while engaged in battle at Athelstaneford with the Saxon King Æthelstan of East Anglia, saw in the heavens the cross of St Andrew. After he won the battle, Achaius is said to have {{established}} the Order of the Thistle, dedicating it to the saint, in 786. The tale is <b>not</b> <b>credible,</b> because the two individuals purported to have fought each other did not even live in the same century. Another story states that Achaius founded the Order in 809 to commemorate an alliance with the Emperor Charlemagne. [...] There is some credibility to this story given the fact that Charlemagne did employ Scottish bodyguards. There is, in addition, a tradition that the order was instituted, or re-instituted, on the battlefield by Robert the Bruce at Bannockburn.|$|E
500|$|Today many {{mainstream}} historians concur {{that this}} estimate is exaggerated. The figure was originally {{based on the}} verdict of the Nanking War Crimes Tribunal which added the burial records of 155,300 bodies with 72,291 destroyed corpses {{to arrive at a}} total of 279,586, though there was an apparent adding mistake in this calculation. Furthermore, this estimate includes an accusation that the Japanese Army murdered 57,418 Chinese POWs at Mufushan, though the latest research indicates that between 4,000 and 20,000 were massacred, and it also includes the 112,266 corpses allegedly buried by the Chongshantang, though today many historians agree that the Chongshantang's records were at least exaggerated if not entirely fabricated. Bob Wakabayashi concludes from this that estimates over 200,000 are <b>not</b> <b>credible.</b> Ikuhiko Hata considers the number of 300,000 to be a [...] "symbolic figure" [...] representative of China's wartime suffering and not a figure to be taken literally.|$|E
