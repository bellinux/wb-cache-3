Controlling for banks' risk factors and credit demand, the first round of VLTROs in December 2011 is not found to have been successful in offsetting the decline in credit supply to Households and <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporates.</b> In contrast, the VLTROs in February 2012 are found to have mitigated the effect of the European sovereign debt crisis on credit supply.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the current {{macroeconomic}} environment there is an expectation of an increase in South African non-financial corporate failure, where advance prediction thereof will become even more important. A number of South African non-financial corporate failures have occurred following the financial crisis. In addition, South Africa experienced a watershed moment with the first default on a non-financial corporate bond in 2013. At the same time, with the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) framework there have been significant advances in the quality of financial information which should improve its usage in predicting corporate failure. This study used the latest sample to date of listed South African <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporates</b> that met the definition of failure but limited the universe of financial information to that which was prepared under IFRS. At the same time, adjustments were made to the financial data based upon pre-selection of independent credit statistic variables most commonly used in ranking relative credit risk for <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporates.</b> Additionally, equity market price data was introduced into the model to add a forward-looking information consideration. This resulted in an eleven variable model where differentiation of corporate failure was facilitated through the use of multiple discriminant analysis...|$|E

Notes for a presentation to IMF-FSB Users Conference on Data Gaps, 8 – 9 July 2009 Luci Ellis, Head of Financial Stability Department, Reserve Bank of Australia The current crisis provides {{the context for}} new {{thinking about how to}} measure vulnerabilities in the non-financial sectors that might feed back onto the financial system. Unlike previous banking crises in industrialised countries, this one was triggered by a household sector and its home mortgage obligations. Normally, imbalances build up in the business sector, for example in commercial property markets or leveraged buyouts. The household sector reacts much later: mortgage arrears rates typically only start to rise (and housing prices fall) significantly once a recession is underway and unemployment is rising rapidly. That is the reverse of the pattern seen in the current US housing crash. The rise in US mortgage arrears has also been unusually severe relative to labour market developments and to past US experience. These contrasts raise the questions of why the United States was different this time, and whether any data existed that would have signalled this unusual vulnerability...|$|E

40|$|Although {{states and}} localities collect a {{substantial}} amount of revenue from corporate profits taxes and property taxes on corporate capital, these taxes have been inadequately reflected in previous calculations of the effective corporate tax rate and the pretax rate of return to corporate capital. The present study focuses on non-financial corporations and begins by estimating the profits taxes and property taxes which these corporations pay to state and local governments. These estimates are then used to calculate the pretax rate of return on <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> capital; the results suggest that the conventional omission of state-local property taxes leads to an understatement of this rate of return by about one percentage point. The effective tax rate on <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> profits is also computed, taking account of state-local taxes. These taxes amount to approximately sixteen percent of the pretax profits of non-financial corporations. The total effective tax rate on these corporations is shown to have risen substantially during the past two decades; it averaged more than seventy percent in the most recent five-year period. The series for the rate of return and effective tax rate are used to compute the real after-tax rate of return on <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> capital. The calculations show that this number has declined recently, reaching 2. 3 percent in 1979. This is to be contrasted with after-tax returns of over five percent which prevailed during the mid- 1960 s. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{mainly focused}} on {{defining}} and determining {{the appropriateness of}} noncorporate governance principles for Local Government. The target, local government organisation, which was chosen for this study, was the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipal (CTMM). The principles, which were identified {{to be the most}} appropriate for this study, were accountability, integrity and disclosure as defined by the King II Report. These principles were separately measured and based on the underlying sub components, which defines these principles. The appropriateness and level of understanding of accountability was measured through the use of sub components, which focussed on a manager’s responsibility, as well as delegations received, guided by the code of conduct of the CTMM. Integrity was measured by fairness, respect for others in the organisation, by showing adequate compassion and by being an honest person. Disclosure on the other hand was measured by the status of information, which can and should be disclosed, whistle blowing policy and protection of whistle blowers, the openness of the CTMM towards their management and workforce and finally the handling of fraud by management. The method followed with this study was to approach managers and deputy managers from the CTMM in order to obtain first hand experience regarding <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> governance principles within the CTMM by means of a qualitative survey. Results from the questionnaire and the subsequent empirical analysis indicate that the CTMM do currently apply some of these principles to specific levels of satisfaction. The viewpoint of managers and deputy managers within the CTMM reflected by the Weaver “best combination” analysis that the appropriateness and the interaction of the sub components are related and important in measuring <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> governance at Local Government.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the popular Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (BGG) model {{is used to}} explore links between the {{financial}} health of the <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> sector and bank lending behaviour on the one hand, {{and the effectiveness of}} monetary policy on the other. The model's microeconomic contracting framework is used to generate specific financial scenarios, defined in terms of steady-state credit spreads, bank lending policies and corporate sector financial health. These scenarios are embedded in the macroeconomic BGG model, and an investigation carried out into how they affect dynamic responses of the real economy to monetary and real shocks. The simulations show that {{in the context of the}} BGG model, the balance sheet positions of the financial and <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> sectors can affect the monetary transmission mechanism. It is illustrated that in certain financial scenarios in the model the financial accelerator mechanism is very potent, whereas in others it has little incremental impact. This implies that, for a given shock, monetary policy can be less or more proactive, respectively. In addition, the model simulation results suggest that certain parameters may merit particular attention. For example, the sensitivity of bank lending policy to news about corporate financial health has an especially marked impact in the model's dynamics. And as illustrated in previous work, corporate leverage also plays an important role in amplifying and propagating shocks. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Considering the sectoral balance {{approach}} of Godley, and focusing {{only on the}} two main components {{of the private sector}} balance for the U. S. economy (household and <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> balance), we investigate the relationship between these two sectors, the financial variables, and economic cycle. In particular, we consider all these relationships endogenously. Design/methodology/approach – We estimate a structural VAR model between household and (<b>non-financial)</b> <b>corporate</b> financial balances, financial markets, and economic cycle and we perform an impulse response analysis. All the variables are expressed as cyclical components applying the Hodrick-Prescott filter. Findings - The main result is that: (1) household and corporate balances react to financial markets in the way we expected and discussed; (2) the economic cycle influences the two financial balances; (3) the corporate balance has a positive impact on the cycle; (4) the economic cycle and financial balances influence the financial variables. In particular, point (3) shows that the corporate balance is a leading component of the cycle as suggested by Casadio and Paradiso (2009) and accords with Minsky’s theory of financial instability. Research limitations/implications – The analysis does not include the foreign sector (current-account balance). Originality/value – Our contribution is an important step forward with respect to the two main contributions in literature which use this approach: the Levy Institute macroeconomic team and Goldman Sachs. Methodologically their models are based on some assumptions (such as exogeneity or market clearing price mechanism for the financial markets) which we overcome considering all the relationships studied in an endogenous manner. ...|$|R

Using data from a sample of non-financial corporations from 1973 to 2003, I find a negative relationship between real investment and financialisation. Two channels can help explain this negative relationship: first, increased financial investment and increased financial profit opportunities may have crowded out real investment by changing the incentives of firm managers and directing funds away from real investment. Second, increased payments to the financial markets may have impeded real investment by decreasing available internal funds, shortening the planning horizons of the firm management and increasing uncertainty...|$|R

In contrast, the price evolution of small loans with short rate fixation periods is still affected by country-specific dynamic factors. There are few signs that bank loan rates are becoming more uniform with time. ...|$|R
