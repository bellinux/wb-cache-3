5|$|The work {{ends with}} the {{following}} words: Fichte and the powerful men who have inherited his ideals, when they see children, think: 'Here is material that I can manipulate'... All this, to any person with <b>natural</b> <b>affection</b> for the young, is horrible; just as we teach children to avoid being destroyed by motor cars if they can, so we should teach them to avoid being destroyed by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E
25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing <b>natural</b> <b>affection</b> and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E
500|$|The passion {{which he}} has taken as his subject is that which strikes its root deepest into the human heart [...] This depth of nature, this force of passion, this tug and war of the {{elements}} of our being, this firm faith in filial piety, and the giddy anarchy and whirling tumult of the thoughts at finding this prop failing it, the contrast between the fixed, immovable basis of <b>natural</b> <b>affection,</b> and the rapid, irregular starts of imagination, suddenly wrenched from all its accustomed holds and resting-places in the soul, this is what Shakespear has given, and what nobody else but he could give.|$|E
50|$|Albert the Great, in his {{commentary}} on Aristotle's Politics also {{refers to a}} monograph on <b>natural</b> <b>affections</b> (Libellus de naturalibus passionibus), as written by Aspasius.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{there comes}} a moment in life when one reverts, irresistibly, to one's natural ties--to one's <b>natural</b> <b>affections.</b> You must have found that!" [...] said Eugenia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Admit him instantly," [...] {{said the}} Archbishop--"my mind {{tells me he}} brings us joyful tidings.--Never knew I such humble penitence,-- such willing {{resignation}} of <b>natural</b> <b>affections</b> and desires to the doing of Heaven's service, but it was rewarded with a guerdon either temporal or spiritual." ...|$|R
2500|$|Between the 19th and mid-20th centuries, some Mormons held racist views, and {{exclusion}} from priesthood {{was not the}} only discrimination practiced toward black people. With Joseph Smith as the mayor of Nauvoo, blacks were prohibited from holding office or joining the Nauvoo Legion. Brigham Young taught that equality efforts were misguided, claiming that those who fought for equality among blacks were trying to elevate them [...] "to an equality with those whom Nature and Nature's God has indicated to be their masters, their superiors", but that instead they should [...] "observe the law of <b>natural</b> <b>affection</b> for our kind." ...|$|E
2500|$|The LDS Church teaches {{its members}} to obey what it calls the law of chastity, which is a code of {{morality}} and modesty. Under this code, all members are taught to be [...] "morally clean in their thoughts, words, and actions" [...] and to abstain from pornography. Violations of this code include [...] "adultery, being without <b>natural</b> <b>affection,</b> lustfulness, infidelity, incontinence, filthy communications, impurity, inordinate affection, fornication. They included all sexual relations outside marriage—petting, sex perversion, and preoccupation with sex in one’s thoughts and talking." [...] Sexual transgressions are considered second only to murder in seriousness.|$|E
2500|$|In her own life, {{there had}} never been any {{conflict}} between Sullivan's home and public life. She was characterized as a perfect wife. No one was closer to her than Mother Angela Gillespie. The <b>natural</b> <b>affection</b> which she bore the directress was increased by the deep respect which she felt for her both as a woman and as an educator. In her “Study of a Soul,” a tribute which she wrote to the memory of Mother Angela, Sullivan said, “Nor was there any shallowness or affectation in Mother Angela's idea of education for girls... Mere bluestockingism she would have laughed at... She looked upon partial development as fully as dangerous as no development at all.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wentworth {{had been}} told the day before by Felix that Eugenia was very clever, very brilliant, and the {{information}} had held him in some suspense. This was the cleverness, he supposed; the brilliancy was beginning. [...] "Yes, the <b>natural</b> <b>affections</b> are very strong," [...] he murmured.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe it}} is so, indeed, Nanny--nay, I am quite certain it is so," [...] Eve answered, the colour {{deepening}} on her cheek, as she gave this opinion to her old nurse, with the inward consciousness that she had just experienced some of the happiest moments of her life, through the admission of a passion that thus overshadowed all the <b>natural</b> <b>affections.</b> [...] "It is, truly? as you say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mothers are {{the best}} lovers in the world, but I don't mind {{whispering}} to Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds. It's very curious, but the more I try to satisfy myself {{with all sorts of}} <b>natural</b> <b>affections,</b> the more I seem to want. I'd no idea hearts could take in so many. Mine is so elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite contented with my family. I don't understand it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only my humble {{trust that}} a priest may be blessed in his appeal to duty even where a father's appeal to <b>natural</b> <b>affection</b> has been disregarded." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly; {{she will}} expect that, should her eyes even be white, and her cheeks black. <b>Natural</b> <b>affection</b> expects this much {{even among the}} least enlightened of the human race." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Mart. Time {{enough for}} that, forsooth, father; but I {{have such a}} <b>natural</b> <b>affection</b> for my sister, that, methinks, I could live and die with her: Give me thy hand, sweet sister.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} what you are, sir,' pursued the Squire. 'You're a Benthamite. I disown you. Your mother would have died for shame; there was no modern cant about your mother; she thought - she said to me, sir - I'm glad she's in her grave, Dick Naseby. Misinformed! Misinformed, sir? Have you no loyalty, no spring, no <b>natural</b> <b>affections?</b> Are you clockwork, hey? Away! This is no place for you. Away!' (waving his hands in the air). 'Go away! Leave me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll {{pull him}} through,' the Squire said grimly, {{as though he}} meant to pull him through a threshing-mill; 'I'll save him from this gang; God help him with the next! He has a taste for low company, and no <b>natural</b> <b>affections</b> to steady him. His father was no society for him; he must go fuddling with a Dutchman, Nance, and now he's caught. Let us pray he'll take the lesson,' he added more gravely, 'but youth is here to make troubles, and age to pull them out again.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was sitting}} {{where he had}} first placed himself, motionless. It struck her {{suddenly}} how frail and white he looked. In the shadowy light of her drawing-room, he {{was almost like a}} spirit sitting there in his grey tweed--silvery from head to foot. Her conscience smote her. It is written of the very old that they shall pass, by virtue of their long travel, out of the country of the understanding of the young, till the <b>natural</b> <b>affections</b> are blurred by creeping mists such as steal across the moors when the sun is going down.|$|R
6000|$|She {{regarded}} her father {{that night with}} a want of <b>natural</b> <b>affection</b> terrible to record. Why had he come just when he had, just as he had? Why had he been so violent, so impossible? ...|$|E
60|$|The nuptials of Ludlow and Alida were {{touched with}} a shade of melancholy. <b>Natural</b> <b>affection</b> in one, and {{professional}} sympathy in the other, {{had given them}} a deep and lasting interest in {{the fate of the}} adventurers.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I throw off,' said Mr Chester, 'the {{restraint}} which <b>natural</b> <b>affection</b> {{would impose}} on some men, and reject all bonds {{but those of}} truth and duty. Miss Haredale, you are deceived; you are deceived by your unworthy lover, and my unworthy son.' ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{approached}} the boundary line Woola ran anxiously before me, and thrust his body against my legs. His expression was pleading rather than ferocious, {{nor did he}} bare his great tusks or utter his fearful guttural warnings. Denied the friendship and companionship of my kind, I had developed considerable affection for Woola and Sola, for the normal earthly man must have some outlet for his <b>natural</b> <b>affections,</b> and so I decided upon an appeal to a like instinct in this great brute, sure that I would not be disappointed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{pull him}} through," [...] the Squire said grimly, {{as though he}} meant to pull him through a threshing-mill; [...] "I'll save him from this gang; God help him with the next!

6000|$|... 'That is a {{suggestion}} {{which should have}} come from me, sir,' roared the father. 'It is out of place upon your lips. It is not {{the thought of a}} loyal son. Why, sir, if my father had been plunged in such deplorable circumstances, I should have thrashed the editor of that vile sheet within an inch of his life. I should have thrashed the man, sir. It would have been the action of an ass; but it would have shown that I had the blood and the <b>natural</b> <b>affections</b> of a man. Son? You are no son, no son of mine, sir!' ...|$|R
60|$|LADY BRITOMART [resignedly] You {{mean that}} I must ask him. Very well, Stephen: It shall be as you wish. You {{will be glad}} to know that your {{grandfather}} concurs. But he thinks I ought to ask Andrew to come here and see the girls. After all, he must have some <b>natural</b> <b>affection</b> for them.|$|E
60|$|So saying, {{she held}} out her hand to her brother, who grasped it with a fondness of {{pressure}} very different from the manner in which they first clasped hands that morning. There was a moment's pause, while the hearts of both were overflowing with a feeling of <b>natural</b> <b>affection,</b> to which circumstances had hitherto rendered them strangers.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, {{the child}} {{exercised}} very considerable and ever-increasing influence over her father; for, although stiff, the knight {{was by no}} means destitute of <b>natural</b> <b>affection,</b> and sometimes observed, with moist eyes, strong traces of resemblance to his lost wife in the beautiful child. Indeed, as years advanced, he became a more and more obedient father, and was obviously on the high road to abject slavery.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{step that}} you're taking, Miss Mullins, I need not tell you, {{is one of}} great gravity," [...] said Judge Thompson, with a certain {{paternal}} seriousness of manner, in which, however, we were glad to detect a glaring affectation; [...] "and I trust {{that you and your}} affianced have fully weighed it. Far be it from me to interfere with or question the <b>natural</b> <b>affections</b> of two young people, but may I ask you what you know of the--er--young gentleman for whom you are sacrificing so much, and, perhaps, imperiling your whole future? For instance, have you known him long?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a {{suggestion}} {{which should have}} come from me, sir," [...] roared the father. [...] "It is out of place upon your lips. It is not {{the thought of a}} loyal son.

6000|$|... "Amen," [...] {{said the}} Grand Master, with solemnity, [...] "but we must deserve his aid. I tell thee, Conrade, {{that neither the}} powers in Heaven, nor the powers on earth, will longer endure the wickedness of this generation--My {{intelligence}} is sure--the ground on which our fabric is reared is already undermined, and each addition we make {{to the structure of}} our greatness will only sink it the sooner in the abyss. We must retrace our steps, and show ourselves the faithful Champions of the Cross, sacrificing to our calling, not alone our blood and our lives--not alone our lusts and our vices--but our ease, our comforts, and our <b>natural</b> <b>affections,</b> and act as men convinced that many a pleasure which may be lawful to others, is forbidden to the vowed soldier of the Temple." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My own fault!' {{beginning}} to whimper. 'The parent I {{have been to}} you, Edith: making you a companion from your cradle! And when you neglect me, and have no more <b>natural</b> <b>affection</b> for me than if I was a stranger--not a twentieth part of the affection that you have for Florence--but I am only your mother, and should corrupt her in a day!--you reproach me with its being my own fault.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am engaged, Ma," [...] sobbed Caddy, [...] "to young Mr. Turveydrop, at the academy; and old Mr. Turveydrop (who {{is a very}} gentlemanly man indeed) {{has given}} his consent, and I beg and pray you'll give us yours, Ma, because I never could be happy without it. I never, never could!" [...] sobbed Caddy, quite forgetful of her general complainings and of {{everything}} but her <b>natural</b> <b>affection.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Really it {{was quite}} touching, {{in spite of its}} being ludicrous, {{the way in which the}} poor fellow poured forth his joy like a very child,--which he was in {{everything}} except years; and Harold could not help remembering, and recalling to Disco's memory, Yoosoof's observations touching the hardness of negroes' hearts, and their want of <b>natural</b> <b>affection,</b> on the morning when his dhow was captured by the boat of the [...] "Firefly." ...|$|E
60|$|And if, {{bearing in}} mind the many Poets {{distinguished}} by this prime quality, whose names I omit to mention; yet justified by recollection of the insults which the ignorant, the incapable and the presumptuous, have heaped upon these and my other writings, I may be permitted to anticipate the judgment of posterity upon myself, I shall declare (censurable, I grant, if the notoriety of the fact above stated does not justify me) that I have given in these unfavourable times, evidence of exertions of this faculty upon its worthiest objects, the external universe, the moral and religious sentiments of Man, his <b>natural</b> <b>affections,</b> and his acquired passions; which have the same ennobling tendency as the productions of men, in this kind, worthy to be holden in undying remembrance.|$|R
5000|$|The poem {{includes}} character {{sketches of}} [...] "Atticus" [...] (Joseph Addison) and [...] "Sporus" [...] (John Hervey). Addison {{is presented as}} having great talent that is diminished by fear and jealousy; Hervey is sexually perverse, malicious, and both absurd and dangerous. Pope marks the virulence of the [...] "Sporus" [...] attack by having Arbuthnot exclaim [...] "Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?" [...] {{in reference to the}} form of torture called the breaking wheel. By emphasizing friendship, Pope counters his image as [...] "an envious and malicious monster" [...] whose [...] "satire springs from a being devoid of all <b>natural</b> <b>affections</b> and lacking a heart." [...] It was an [...] "efficient and authoritative revenge": in this poem and others of the 1730s, Pope presents himself as writing satire not out of ego or misanthropy, but to serve impersonal virtue.|$|R
25|$|April – In another conference address apostle Kimball {{called the}} {{decriminalization}} of consensual same-sex sexual activity a damnable heresy, {{and the voices}} speaking in favor of churches accepting homosexuals as ugly and loud. He additionally referred to homosexual people as millions of perverts without <b>natural</b> family <b>affection</b> whose practice was spreading like wildfire and changing the world.|$|R
