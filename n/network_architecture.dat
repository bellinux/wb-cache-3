The project uses statistical simulation methodology that is a paradigm shift from traditional computing methods.

Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Currently, the design, {{deployment}} {{and refinement}} of new <b>network</b> <b>architectures</b> is a manual, ad-hoc and time-consuming process. We present the design, implementation {{and evaluation of}} the Genesis Kernel, a programming system that automates the life cycle process for the creation, deployment, management, and architecting of <b>network</b> <b>architectures.</b> We discuss our experiences in building a spawning network {{that is capable of}} creating distinct virtual <b>network</b> <b>architectures</b> on-demand. The Genesis Kernel is based on a methodology that allows a child virtual network to operate on top of a subset of its parent’s network resources and in isolation from other spawned virtual networks. We show through experimentation how a number of diverse <b>network</b> <b>architectures</b> can be spawned and architecturally refined. These spawned <b>network</b> <b>architectures</b> include a parent network that supports IP forwarding, and interior and exterior routing. We discuss how two child networks based on Cellular IP and Mobiware architectures can be spawned on the parent network to support wireless access to data and continuous media services, respectively.

25|$|As the Earth’s {{most common}} organic material, {{cellulose}} {{can be classified}} into plant cellulose and bacterial cellulose, {{both of which are}} naturally occurring. Plant cellulose, which makes up the cell walls of most plants, is a tough, mesh-like bulkwork in which cellulose fibrils are the primary architectural elements. While bacterial cellulose has the same molecular formula as plant cellulose, it has significantly different macromolecular properties and characteristics. In general, microbial cellulose is more chemically pure, containing no hemicellulose or lignin, has a higher water holding capacity and hydrophilicity, greater tensile strength resulting from a larger amount of polymerization, ultrafine <b>network</b> <b>architecture.</b> Furthermore, bacterial cellulose can be produced on a variety of substrates and can be grown to virtually any shape due to the high moldability during formation. Additionally, bacterial cellulose has a more crystalline structure compared to plant cellulose and forms characteristic ribbon-like microfibrils. A hallmark of microbial cellulose, these thin microfibrils are significantly smaller than those in plant cellulose, making bacterial cellulose much more porous.|$|E

All hosts on a subnetwork have the same network prefix. This routing prefix occupies the most-significant bits of the address. The number of bits allocated within a network to the internal routing prefix may vary between subnets, depending on the <b>network</b> <b>architecture.</b> [...] While in IPv6 the prefix must consist of a set of contiguous 1-bits, in IPv4 this is not enforced, though there is no advantage to using non-contiguous 1-bits. The host part is a unique local identification and is either a host number on the local network or an interface identifier.|$|E
