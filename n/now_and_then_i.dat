The name James R. Flynn {{is by far the}} first that comes to mind. His book, Race, IQ and Jensen (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.|$|E

The liner notes read: [...] "My arrangements of [...] Three Gymnopédies comprise ALL the notes of the original piano versions: a most complex process since all the piano sounds must fit comfortably, or uncomfortably, onto the six strings of the guitar." [...] He continues to say: [...] "The present recording is done {{as it is in}} concert, on one classical guitar, without overdubbing. My tempo is a little quicker than when the pieces are played on the piano, due to the shorter resonance time of notes played on the Spanish guitar. <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> use a 'vibrato' and slides, which, of course, can't be done on the piano but which add warmth of expression to this undeniably charming, exotic and mystic music." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'So it is, to staid old fogies {{like you}} and me,' said Felix, kissing her; 'but the young ones want a lark <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> confess I should be immensely {{disappointed}} if this fun didn't come off. No, no, W. W., I can't have you an old cat; you are much too young and pretty.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Chudleigh {{gave him}} a gracious smile. [...] "I've lost my enthusiasm for dancing and need a rest <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> Besides, <b>I</b> like a talk with {{interesting}} people." ...|$|R
2500|$|Alternate identities {{presented}} include [...] "Damita Jo", {{an aggressive}} persona mentioned during the album's title track and [...] "Sexhibition", and [...] "Strawberry", a lascivious performer who emerges on [...] "Strawberry Bounce". Speaking about the personae, Jackson said [...] "She's {{another way to}} express and expose a deeper part of me." [...] "Damita Jo" [...] is [...] "a lot harsher, and quick {{to put you in}} your place. She doesn't sit and ponder about stuff, where I'll go, 'Should I or shouldn't I?' She's tougher than I am. Then there's Strawberry. She's the most sexual of them all, the wildest." [...] Blender magazine commented the latter identity represents [...] "a time when she doesn't need to be the polite, professional Janet, and can turn into raw, unrestrained Strawberry." [...] Jackson added [...] "It's not an everyday indulgence. Not even every week. But every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> like playing around in that mode." [...] Jackson said the characters [...] "absolutely" [...] live inside of her, exclaiming [...] "it feels wonderful" [...] to release them. The concept is further explored in [...] "Looking for Love", in which Jackson says every individual is composed of [...] "many people rolled into one," [...] unified by a similar motive of seeking love, companionship, or identity. Jackson previously desired to record an album which was a [...] "complete departure" [...] from what she is known for and title it after her middle name, but was convinced to use the title for the album by producer Dallas Austin. The title was initially used as self-acceptance; saying [...] "My mother made up [...] "Damita." [...] I presumed [...] "Jo" [...] was for Joseph, my father, even though I later learned it wasn't. Because he was emotionally withdrawn, I was never comfortable using it. For years I didn't. Now I love being called Jo. I've come to the point where I'm trying to accept - even embrace - everything that has happened to me. I believe that without acceptance there's no serenity." ...|$|E

6000|$|Dane smiled curiously. [...] "Then I {{think it}} is enough for me, and you will {{overlook}} my presumption. Courthorne, <b>I</b> wonder <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>I</b> shall altogether understand you!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "if you're {{short of}} capital, I think some could be got. Sound {{investments}} don't pay much, and <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> feel I'd like a venture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mortimer is a stick," [...] Barbara agreed. [...] "He and Grace have a calm superiority {{that makes}} one savage <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> like human people, who {{sometimes}} let themselves go--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Secretive chaps, you sailors," [...] he observed. [...] "Never mind, I have a pal in the Admiralty {{who gives}} me a few hints <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> shall go and pump him." ...|$|E

6000|$|A twinkle {{crept into}} Wyllard's eyes. [...] "It {{seems to me}} a good one as far as it goes; anyway, I've been driven rather hard myself <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he knew {{me quite}} well. When I was at Hope {{he used to}} do errands for me <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> tipped him quite liberally, so he remembered me," [...] {{answered}} Dora.|$|R
6000|$|Tony {{endeavored}} to slip his arm about her. “I know I’m a bad‐tempered beast <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> {{can only tell}} you that you are ever so much too good for me again.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is my name, sir," [...] Peter Ruff admitted, pleasantly [...] "Yours I believe, is Dory. We {{are likely}} to come across one another <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> suppose. Glad to know you." ...|$|E
6000|$|She turned towards Urmston with {{a little}} laugh. [...] "You haven't got it, Reggie, though <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> almost fancy that Carrie has. I don't {{think you would have}} made a good moss-trooper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Hetty, with {{a twinkle}} in her eyes, [...] "I felt I had to do {{something}} a little out of the usual, and it was really safe enough. Everybody feels that way <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't well work it off by quarrelling with you, or going out and talking to the boys as my father does. I don't know a better cure than a gallop or a switchback in a sleigh." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{great deal}} better, my dear. But I didn't {{know that you}} {{regarded}} my work as self-indulgence altogether. I have flattered myself <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> that <b>I</b> was doing it for you, too." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes; {{it claims}} all my thought, though <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> deny the claim. The sea pulls and a boat's a {{fascinating}} toy; but a time comes when one must put one's toys away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] said John Squire. [...] "Very {{good and}} godly: but still I du like a merry catch <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> du. Wouldn't you let a body sing 'Rumbelow'--even when he's heaving of the anchor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I don't {{know any}} reason why I shouldn't, and <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> get the hack-saw and cut one or two across. When I go {{shooting}} it's a deer I want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you met the Miss Merril Jimmy mentioned?" [...] she asked. [...] "I almost fancy she is {{the girl}} I used to see <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>I</b> was in Toronto. What is she like?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know Bill," [...] he answered. [...] "He's over in {{the offices}} at San Antonio mostly, but he {{occasionally}} comes out here on business for Mr. Watson. I must say I don't like him very much, and I don't think the other men do either. He's a fellow who likes to drink <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> understand he often gambles. That is, when he has the money. He's usually strapped long before pay-day comes around." ...|$|R
6000|$|Campbell, cheerfully: [...] "Oh, I'll stay by, Roberts; you needn't be afraid. There's nothing {{mean about}} me, and you'll want {{somebody}} to pull you together, <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{know just what}} to do; I've been through {{this kind of thing}} with lots of fellows in California.

[...] Roberts has come back from his dressing-room and is staring vacantly at Campbell.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Wannop; [...] "I {{want to be}} fair. I don't think Andrew Allinson {{would wish}} any undue {{pressure}} put on his tenants either. As we talk over things <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> know his views." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Kate; [...] "our father {{purchased}} {{him just}} a week before your arrival, thinking that you would likely want a charger <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> have only been on him once before.--Would he make a good buffalo-runner, Jacques?" ...|$|E
