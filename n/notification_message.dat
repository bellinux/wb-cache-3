40|$|Workflow {{interoperability}} {{is receiving}} increasing {{attention from the}} distributed computing community. Different standards and levels have been set to achieve interoperability among workflow system, for example, by the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC). WS-based <b>notification</b> <b>messaging</b> systems provide a mechanism for decoupling and enabling asynchronous messaging among different applications in the distributed computing environment. In this paper a generic approach to achieving interoperability among workflow systems, based on a WS-based <b>notification</b> <b>messaging</b> system, is proposed. This approach exposes an API called Publish/Subscribe Scientific Workflow Interoperability Framework (PS-SWIF) that can be implemented in multiple workflow systems to provide run time interoperability. The PS-SWIF application is based on Web Services that enable scientists to apply a Publish/Subscribe mechanism to publish a topic using a workflow system, and enables different workflow systems to subscribe to this topic and receive <b>notification</b> <b>messages</b> when an event is executed...|$|R

50|$|There is no {{out-of-the-box}} {{ability for}} a client to kick or redirect another client from a hub. The hub, however, can kick and redirect arbitrarily. The hub can also require that all other clients in the hub must terminate their transfers with the kicked/redirected client. If a client is redirected to another hub, the redirecting client must use a referrer, similar to the HTTP referrer. The kicked/redirected client {{is not required to}} receive a <b>notification</b> <b>message.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} kick or move (redirect) a user to another hub is {{supported}} by the protocol. If a user is kicked, the hub is not required to give that user a specific reason, and there is no restriction on where a user can be redirected to. However, if another client in power instructs the hub to kick, that client may send out a <b>notification</b> <b>message</b> before doing so. Redirecting a user must be accompanied by a reason. There is no HTTP referer equivalent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{application}} of this pattern is dependent upon the existence of underlying platform extensions, which if not already present, would incur extra cost and therefore would impact the IT budget. It {{should also be noted}} that the publisher-subscriber model is based on [...] messaging, so the transmission of a message from the event manager can take place at any time, which could mean that if the event manager broadcasts an event <b>notification</b> <b>message</b> then it's not necessary that the service consumer would be online to receive it. Therefore, the {{application of}} this design pattern does not solve the unavailability problems. However, this could be addressed by further applying the Asynchronous Queuing and the Reliable Messaging design patterns that guarantee that a transmitted message is always received by the intended receiver along with acknowledgment messages.|$|E

5000|$|An event can {{be defined}} as [...] "a {{significant}} change in state". [...] For example, when a consumer purchases a car, the car's state changes from [...] "for sale" [...] to [...] "sold". A car dealer's system architecture may treat this state change as an event whose occurrence can be made known to other applications within the architecture. From a formal perspective, what is produced, published, propagated, detected or consumed is a (typically asynchronous) message called the event notification, and not the event itself, which is the state change that triggered the message emission. Events do not travel, they just occur. However, the term event is often used metonymically to denote the <b>notification</b> <b>message</b> itself, which may lead to some confusion. This is due to Event-Driven architectures often being design atop message-driven architectures, where such communication pattern requires one of the inputs to be text-only, the message, to differentiate how each communication should be handled.|$|E

Asynchronous <b>notification</b> <b>messages</b> and asynchronous request messages are the sole basis for inter-component communication. A key aspect of the style is that components are not built with any dependencies on what typically would be considered lower-level components, such as user interface toolkits. Indeed, all components are oblivious to the existence of any components to which <b>notification</b> <b>messages</b> are sent. While our focus has been on applications involving graphical user interfaces, the style has the potential for broader applicability.
