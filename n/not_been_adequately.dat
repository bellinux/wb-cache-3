5|$|As {{early as}} June 1775, Colonel Joseph Goreham {{had been ordered}} by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia {{for the defense of}} the {{province}} against Patriot activity. Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776, Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of the RFA did what they could to restore the premises to a defensible condition. But Goreham had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>adequately</b> provisioned and his men lacked everything from victuals to uniforms. Furthermore, the locals were generally sympathetic to the Patriot cause, and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort, even trying to induce members of the garrison to defect.|$|E
5|$|At 05:37 {{an enemy}} contact report was made, and course {{was changed to}} {{starboard}} to close range. Neither ship was in good fighting trim. Hood, designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate decking armour {{and would have to}} close the range quickly, as she would become progressively less vulnerable to plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>adequately</b> retrained. Prince of Wales, with thicker armour, was less vulnerable to 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, but they had made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their aft turrets could not fire. Prinz Eugen, with Bismarck , had Prince of Wales and Hood slightly forward of the beam, and both ships could deliver full broadsides.|$|E
5|$|Two Australian CH-47Ds were {{destroyed}} in Afghanistan. On 30 May 2011, A15-102 crashed in Zabul Province, {{resulting in the}} death of an Army unmanned aerial vehicle pilot who was travelling on board as a passenger. As it was impractical to recover the helicopter, it was destroyed by Coalition forces. The official inquiry into the crash found that it was caused by a known issue in which Chinooks suffered uncommanded pitch oscillations while flying through dense altitudes, and that the aircrew had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>adequately</b> trained to prevent such incidents. A15-103 was written off following a hard landing in Kandahar Province on 22 June 2012, resulting in minor injuries to one of its aircrew. Both of the Chinooks at Kandahar International Airport in April 2013 also suffered significant damage when the airport was struck by a severe hail storm. Two ex-US Army CH-47Ds were purchased in December 2011 to replace A15-102, and arrived in Australia in January 2012.|$|E

5|$|A deep {{stop was}} {{originally}} an extra stop introduced by divers during ascent, at a greater depth than the deepest stop required by their computer algorithm or tables. This practice {{is based on}} empirical observations by technical divers such as Richard Pyle, who found that they were less fatigued if they made some additional stops for short periods at depths considerably deeper than those calculated with the currently published decompression algorithms. More recently computer algorithms that are claimed to use deep stops have become available, but these algorithms {{and the practice of}} deep stops have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>adequately</b> validated. Deep stops are likely to be made at depths where ingassing continues for some slow tissues, so the addition of deep stops of any kind can only be included in the dive profile when the decompression schedule has been computed to include them, so that such ingassing of slower tissues can be taken into account. Nevertheless, deep stops may be added on a dive that relies on a personal dive computer with real-time computation, as the PDC will track the effect of the stop on its decompression schedule. Deep stops are otherwise similar to any other staged decompression, but are unlikely to use a dedicated decompression gas, as they are usually not more than two to three minutes long.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{construction}} {{continued on}} {{the western part of}} the US 80 freeway. On August 27, 1951, the final link in the new freeway between Point Loma and La Mesa was dedicated. The next year, planning continued for the possibility of a freeway bypass of El Cajon that would connect to the existing US 80 freeway. However, many El Cajon Boulevard motel owners raised objections over the reassigning of the US 80 designation to the new freeway, as it would potentially harm business. In response, the Highway Development Association proposed designating El Cajon Boulevard as a business route. But in order to obtain funding for the construction, the new route would have to be added to the state highway system by the California State Legislature, or be designated as US 80. Later, a Freeway 80 Association was formed to encourage public support for the construction of the bypass of El Cajon, and the conversion of the Alvarado Canyon and Mission Valley roads into a freeway. Following the city of San Diego council and county approval, the California State Assembly transportation committee heard complaints from citizens claiming that they had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>adequately</b> notified about the plans for US 80 or SR 94, or given enough time to provide input.|$|E

25|$|Although {{members of}} the HIV/AIDS denialist {{community}} are united by their disagreement with the scientific finding that HIV {{is the cause of}} AIDS, the specific positions taken by various groups differ.

Suggested alternative causes of AIDS include recreational drugs, malnutrition, and the very antiretroviral drugs used to treat the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Fructose {{is absorbed}} in the small {{intestine}} without help of digestive enzymes. Even in healthy persons, however, only about 25â€“50g of fructose per sitting can be properly absorbed. People with fructose malabsorption absorb less than 25g per sitting. Simultaneous ingestion of fructose and sorbitol seems to increase malabsorption of fructose. Fructose that has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>adequately</b> absorbed is fermented by intestinal bacteria producing hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and short-chain fatty acids.

Serologic tests for Lyme disease are of limited use in people lacking objective signs of Lyme disease because of false positive results and cost.|$|E
