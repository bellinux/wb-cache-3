It is proposed that competition for resources, such as the host tissues with exudate-rich infection sites and the organic residue in the potting mix, is the principal factor influencing the interactions between P. u. sporangiiferum and BNR. It is also suggested that BNR isolates employ at least three strategies to exert competitive advantage over P. U. sporangiiferum.

Granite powder was blended with two composts of different origins and properties: one elaborated from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW), and another from pine bark. Since all materials presented pH values over 8, which are excessive for growing most vegetal species, the use of iron sulphate to acidify them has been assessed. Three doses of iron sulphate (14, 69, and 97 g kg(- 1), equivalent to 0. 1, 0. 5, and 0. 7 meq H+ g(- 1)) {{were added to the}} granitic powder and mixtures with 25 or 75 % (v/v) of each compost, which were incubated in the laboratory during 30 days.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a photostable formulation of methoprene and two photostable juvenoids, fenoxycarb and pyriproxyfen, and their residual activity in inhibiting {{the emergence of}} adult cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche), was studied in topsoil. <b>Nursery</b> <b>pots</b> composed of clay, peat, and plastic, and wooden flats were used to hold soil samples.

Methoprene was as effective as fenoxycarb and pyriproxyfen against cat fleas for up to 42 d in clay, peat, and plastic pots at a concentration of 64. 56 mg (AI) /m(2) (6 mg [AI] /ft(2)), but its activity declined significantly thereafter. In contrast, fenoxycarb and pyriproxyfen showed strong residual activity for the entire 63 d.

40|$|Plantation {{forestry}} {{with exotic}} trees in south China needs compatible symbionts {{to improve the}} growth of seedlings in nurseries and to enhance establishment and growth in the field. Scleroderma, a potentially suitable symbiont for inoculation, is not being used in containerized nurseries in the region due to poor knowledge of its host range. The ability of 15 collections of Scleroderma, nine from Australia and six from Asia, to colonize and promote growth of four important exotic plantation trees (Eucalyptus globulus Labill., Eucalyptus urophylla ST Blake, Pinus elliottii Engl., and Pinus radiata D. Don) was examined in a <b>nursery</b> <b>potting</b> mix. There was generally low host specificity of Scleroderma between tree genera. At 12 weeks after inoculation, 13 to 14 of the 15 spore collections formed ectomycorrhizas on seedlings of eucalypts or pines. The extent of colonization differed between spore treatments with two or four collections forming abundant mycorrhizas (> 50 % fine roots colonized) on E. globulus or E. urophylla, respectively, and three or five on P. radiata or P. elliottii, respectively. Three collections from Australia strongly colonized all hosts resulting in 26 to 100 % of short roots being colonized. Chinese Scleroderma collections resulted in fewer mycorrhizas on eucalypts than on pines. Inoculation stimulated the growth (shoot height and dry weight) of eucalypt and pine seedlings by up to 105 % where Scleroderma mycorrhizas developed. The results {{suggest that there is}} a need to source Scleroderma from outside China for inoculating eucalypts in Chinese nurseries whereas Chinese collections of Scleroderma could be used in pine nurseries.

40|$|The horticultural crops {{considered}} {{in this chapter}} are characterised {{by the fact that}} the plants are grown in a restricted volume, like pots, containers, plastic trays or compressed peat blocks. In the market these crops are recognized as potted plants, bedding plants and container grown nursery stock, mostly for ornamental purposes. Another group is the raising of young vegetable and cut flower plants, due to production holdings. Although extremely diverse, all these plants are grown as single units and this makes the water supply of the plants complicated. Trickle irrigation is generally unsuitable because it is laborious, due to rapid changing crops and plant densities and besides expensive because of the large number of units per area. Exceptions are the plants grown in large containers, like balcony and patio plants, some nursery stock and subtropical trees with a long growing period and a low plant density. Overhead sprinklers induce excessive losses of irrigation water and nutrients, since a considerable amount of the irrigated water falls alongside the pots or drips from the leaf canopy mostly also alongside the pots. Moreover, the water supplied is absorbed per individual plant or plant batch, which strongly enhances the variation in the water and nutrient status of such units. To avoid these problems, potted plants already have been grown for many years on concrete floors or on container benches with sub-irrigation. Nowadays, in all modern greenhouses this is the common growing system. In contrast with vegetable and cut flower <b>nurseries,</b> <b>potted</b> plant <b>nurseries</b> are not always specialised in one crop, but in different plant species.

40|$|ABSTRACT Nursery {{trees of}} stone fruits (Prunus spp.) are {{traditionally}} produced by union of two distinct genotypes - the rootstock and the scion - which, by grafting, form a composite plant {{that will be}} maintained throughout of all plant life.

Carob trees enter slowly into production phase. Where in areas with good growing conditions, the cropping starts 3-4 years after budding, the nonbearing period can take up to 8 years in regions with marginal soils. Full bearing of the trees occurs mostly at a tree-age of 20-25 years where the yield stabilizes. The orchards are traditionally planted in low densities around 25-45 trees/hectare. Hermaphrodite plants or male trees, which produce no or fewer pods, respectively, are usually planted in lower densities in the orchards as pollenizers.|$|R
