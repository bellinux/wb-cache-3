The primary results are as follows. Firstly, we reaffirmthat it is important for people to value prey as well as predators in order to maintain aviable population. Secondly, as the willingness to pay for the prey increases relative tothe price of the prey, the amount of the resource will be prioritized over the amount of theharvest. Thirdly, the minimum/maximum price may be required for resource conservationand conservation rather than protection is required even if the willingness to pay for theprey increases.

We also sought to identify how they prioritize between these use and <b>non-use</b> <b>values.</b> Use values are derived from productivity considerations; <b>non-use</b> <b>values</b> are derived from the wellbeing of the animals, independent of the present or future use the farmer may make of the animal. In particular, we examined the empirical content {{and structure of the}} economic value dairy farmers associate with animal welfare of dairy cows. Based on a best-worst scaling approach and data from 123 Swedish dairy farmers, we suggest that the economic value those farmers associate with animal welfare of dairy cows covers aspects of both use and non-use type, with <b>non-use</b> <b>values</b> appearing more important. Using principal component factor analysis, we were able to check unidimensionality of the economic value construct. These findings are useful for understanding why dairy farmers may be interested in considering dairy cow welfare. Such understanding is essential for improving agricultural policy and advice aimed at encouraging dairy farmers to improve animal welfare; communicating to consumers the values under which dairy products are produced; and providing a basis for more realistic assumptions when developing economic models about dairy farmers’ behavior...|$|R

40|$|Livestock perform several vital {{roles in}} rural {{livelihoods}} in Africa, providing food (meat, milk, eggs), draught power and transport, {{as well as}} income from sales of animals and animal products. However, the implications for animal welfare are not always considered. Theory suggests that animal welfare follows an ‘n-curve’ in relation to productivity. It tends to be low in smallholder farming and pastoral systems (due to inadequate feed, water and veterinary care), to rise with semi-commercial livestock production (increasing the use-value of animals requires investment), and to fall again with full commercialisation (exploitation for profit maximisation overrides welfare considerations). This paper argues that livestock keepers invest in animal welfare {{to the extent that}} this increases their productivity, but they might also derive <b>non-use</b> <b>value</b> from treating their animals well. If the economic returns plus <b>non-use</b> <b>value</b> are not sufficient, regulations to protect livestock must be introduced and compliance must be enforced, to ensure that an adequate investment in animal welfare is achieved and to achieve a better balance between human and animal welfare...|$|E

However, it has been difficult to tease apart these values at the behavioral level. Using an innovative fishing game, we study an important tradeoff between one kind of use value (monetary value) and one kind of <b>non-use</b> <b>value</b> (existence value) of the endangered Steller sea lion. In the fishing game, players make repeated decisions on how much pollock to harvest for profit in each period in a dynamic ecosystem. The population of the endangered sea lion depends on the population of pollock, which in turn depends on the harvesting behavior of humans. The data show that in general, people responded to the financial value (as a tourist resource), but not the existence value, of the sea lion by cutting down commercial fish harvesting to keep more sea lions in the ecosystem. However, not all people behaved the same regarding the existence value. Females displayed a higher existence value than males, as did people who reported stronger pro-environmental attitudes than those with weaker pro-environmental attitudes. Our findings have multiple implications on public opinion elicitation and public policy design...|$|E

30|$|Economic {{valuation}} {{of natural and}} environmental resources includes two categories, i.e., use <b>values</b> and <b>non-use</b> <b>values</b> (Pearce and Pearce 2001; Molaei 2009). Use values {{are associated with the}} consumption of products, while <b>non-use</b> <b>values</b> are related to enhancement of their utility to people without direct consumption of the products. <b>Non-use</b> <b>values</b> which reflect the concept of conservation consist of existence values, bequest values and option values. Existence value refers to the intrinsic value of a resource, even if people have never seen or used the resource (Torras 2000). Bequest value or future generation value is the desirability resulting from knowledge in preserving natural resources for future generations (Pearce and Pearce 2001). Option value measures the preference of individuals to preserve natural resources for possible future use (Lee and Han 2002). Alternatively, existence value can be considered the willingness of a society to pay for the conservation of natural resources, bequest value may be understood as the willingness to pay (WTP) for conservation of resources for the benefit of future generations, while option value can be defined as the willingness of society to pay for the conservation of resources for possible future use (Lee and Han 2002).|$|R

We find that the major proportion of the respondents’ willingness to pay (WTP) for conservation of wild elephants is attributable to the <b>non-use</b> <b>values</b> of the elephant. However, differences in the relative importance of these values exist between those who visit national parks and those who do not. Differences in respondents’ WTP for conservation of elephants are found to be largely influenced by attitudinal and behavioural factors rather than socio-economic ones. We conclude that policymakers must recognise and take account of the importance of <b>non-use</b> <b>values</b> of the Asian elephant, if this endangered species is to survive in the long run. Nevertheless, the non-consumptive use value of elephants in Sri Lanka is also found to be substantial.

40|$|In this paper, we use {{a unique}} {{combination}} of questionnaire data and real market purchase data on organic food to examine whether stated values can predict purchase behaviour. Our data cover around 2000 households during 1997 - 2001 and it is combined with a survey administered on the same panel in 2001. We distinguish between use values (health, taste and freshness attributes) and <b>non-use</b> <b>values</b> (environmental and animal welfare attributes). <b>Non-use</b> <b>values</b> are on average valued much more than use values according to consumers’ own statements. However, combining these consumer statements with their actual market behaviour, it becomes evident that the propensity to purchase organic increases significantly with the weight assigned to use values. We test this empirically by estimating simple logit and multinomial logit models of consumer choice dependent on stated values and individual characteristics. Stated use values increase the probability of being an organic user to a significant extent. The effect of stated <b>non-use</b> <b>values</b> is lower, but not always significant depending on food product group. Whether we consider stated willingness to pay extra taxes to finance a subsidy for organic farming or observed willingness to pay for organic products on the real market, the majority of consumers are only willing to pay if they hold both types of value. That is, acknowledgement of <b>non-use</b> <b>values</b> can explain part of actual purchasing behaviour, but the contribution from use values is much larger. Thus, we can conclude that even though households assign the highest <b>values</b> to the <b>non-use</b> attributes when surveyed, it is the valued use attributes that make them buy organic foods. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{exploitation}} and conversion of rangeland ecosystems is often explained by economists {{as being the}} result of an undervaluation of the goods and services provided by the rangelands. Undervaluation of rangelands may contribute to their mismanagement or their transformation to monoculture, such as livestock or gathering. Similarly, this may lead to inappropriate policy recommendations and prescriptions. This study undertakes a valuation exercise in an effort to address causes of undervaluation. The objective of the study is to estimate the annual direct, indirect and <b>non-use</b> <b>values</b> per household of communal rangelands in the Eastern Cape Province, based on both primary and secondary data. The exercise incorporates the two major direct uses, both marketed and non-marketed, of rangelands - livestock and gathering. Contingent valuation method based on stated preferences by individual household was used to value the indirect and <b>non-use</b> <b>values</b> of the communal rangelands (e. g. erosion protection and burial sites). Data was collected using PRAs, structured questionnaires and interviews by trained enumerators. The study shows that half of the households owned livestock, which is the main economic use of the rangelands and gathering of natural resources also made an economic contribution. Every household was involved in collection of range resources such as fuel wood, wild fruits, thatch grass, building poles, hunting, fishing make a significant contribution to the direct use values: in the case of gathering it shows that there is “hidden harvest” of many of the natural resources from the rangelands.
