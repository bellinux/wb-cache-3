5|$|A metal-surfaced {{road from}} US 20 in Rushville to {{north of the}} Niobrara River was {{constructed}} between 1940 and 1948. It was extended south to north of Cravath Lake by 1953. The road {{was removed from the}} highway system map in 1957, and was re-added in 1960, as N-250. A <b>narrow</b> <b>road</b> was extended from N-250 to N-2 around 1981–82, but it was not part of N-250 until 1996. The routing has not changed significantly since.|$|E

A link-boy blows on the flame of his torch, street-urchins are playing with the fire, and one of their fireworks is falling in at the coach window.|$|E

5|$|The Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge, {{the first}} bridge {{to connect the}} two towns, had become {{functionally}} obsolete. Its <b>narrow</b> <b>road</b> had only two lanes with no shoulders. Because of its location near a sharp bend in the Mississippi River, the bridge had become a hazard to river traffic; barges and towboats frequently collided with it. In 1994, a study concluded that a new bridge was needed and the old one should be torn down. Construction was begun in 2001 and the new bridge opened in 2010. In 2011, the process of removing the old bridge began.|$|E

25|$|On September 14, 1897 Rüedi {{and some}} other {{residents}} of Arosa established a commission {{with the objective of}} broadening the <b>narrow</b> <b>road</b> from Chur to Arosa. In 1900 (or shortly before) Carl Rüedi and the Graubünden Landammann (governor) Hans Brunold of Peist (1861 – 1941) submitted petitions to the Great Council (the parliament of Graubünden) and the Federal Assembly of Switzerland for the erection of an electric railway between Chur and Arosa.|$|E
25|$|In the Pre-modern or Edo period (1602–1869) {{some new}} styles of poetry developed. One of {{greatest}} and most influential styles was renku, (also known as haikai no renga, or haikai), emerging from renga {{in the medieval}} period. Matsuo Bashō was a great haikai master and had a wide influence on his contemporaries and later generations. Bashō was also a prominent writer of haibun, a combination of prose and haiku, one famous example being his Oku no Hosomichi (or, The <b>Narrow</b> <b>Road</b> to the Interior).|$|E

25|$|Most of the climbs {{are located}} in a {{relatively}} small area, causing the roads to turn constantly and often abruptly, which explains the winding and irregular trajectory of the finale. The Oude Kwaremont is the longest climb at 2.2km: an atypical hill {{because it is not}} very steep, but {{considered one of the most}} arduous climbs in Flanders because of its length and cobbled surface. The steepest of all is the fully cobbled Koppenberg, 600meters in length with grueling stretches of 22% over a poorly paved <b>narrow</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
25|$|The British prevailed at the Battle of Krabbendam near Alkmaar on 10 September, {{where the}} Batavians and French were routed. This defeat was {{partly due to}} sloppy staffwork that {{allocated}} one <b>narrow</b> <b>road</b> to the columns of both Batavian divisions {{that were supposed to}} converge on the hamlet of Krabbendam. This hamlet sat astride one of the few entry roads to the Zijpe polder in which Abercromby had set up an armed camp. The polder formed a natural redoubt with its dike acting as a rampart and its circular drainage canal as a moat. The straight and <b>narrow</b> <b>road</b> through Krabbendam formed one of the few easy entries, but it was easily defensible also. The original plan had this entry point attacked by both Batavian divisions, but because Daendels' division was forced to take a more easterly route, only the division of Dumonceau was brought to bear. This division could not be fully deployed {{due to the nature of}} the terrain and the Batavian forces were therefore again fed piecemeal into the battle. They were unable to prevail over the valiant defence of the British 20th Foot. Elsewhere, the French division of General Vandamme was likewise unable to overcome the obstacles of the canal and the dike behind it, that protected the British troops. Vandamme therefore failed to turn Abercromby's right flank as planned.|$|E
25|$|The {{road to the}} Black Spring is near city Dehloran {{and leads}} to the Abgarm natural {{protected}} area. A sign guides visitors to the spring via a <b>narrow</b> <b>road.</b> The last few hundred meters of the road is not suitable for vehicles and requires a short walk to reach to the spring. Visitors will notice the smell of tar as they approach. The spring’s diameter is about 9 meters and hot water full of liquid tar particles flows out of it. There is a fence to protect animals from going nearby and get trapped in the tar.|$|E

25|$|On 1 March 1811, Muhammad Ali invited all of {{the leading}} Mamluks to his palace to {{celebrate}} the declaration of war against the Wahhabis in Arabia. Between 600 and 700 Mamluks paraded for this purpose in Cairo. Muhammad Ali's forces killed almost {{all of the}}se near the Al-Azab gates in a <b>narrow</b> <b>road</b> down from Mukatam Hill. This ambush {{came to be known}} as the Massacre of the Citadel. According to contemporary reports, only one Mamluk, whose name is given variously as Amim (also Amyn), or Heshjukur (a Besleney), survived when he forced his horse to leap from the walls of the citadel.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, the National Park Service {{began using}} the Munson Valley complex year-around. This had a {{tremendous}} impact on the historic landscape. Many landscape features including curbing, planting beds, and walkways had to be removed in order to widen <b>narrow</b> <b>road</b> to accommodate snow plows. Some porches had to be removed and snow tunnels were added to buildings for winter access. In 1954, all of the planters, lawns, and walks around the employee cottages were removed to facilitate snow removal. The traffic island near the upper group of cottages was also removed along with several utility buildings in the maintenance area to allow space for snow plows to turn around.|$|E
25|$|William B. Taliaferro's fresh Confederate brigade {{arrived from}} Port Republic {{and pressed the}} {{retreating}} Federals for several miles north along the Luray Road, taking several hundred prisoners. The Confederate army was left in possession of the field. Shortly after noon, Frémont's army began to deploy {{on the west bank}} of the South Fork, too late to aid Tyler's defeated command, and watched helplessly from across the rain-swollen river. Frémont deployed artillery on the high bluffs to harass the Confederate forces. Jackson gradually withdrew along a <b>narrow</b> <b>road</b> through the woods and concentrated his army in the vicinity of Mt. Vernon Furnace. Jackson expected Frémont to cross the river and attack him on the following day, but during the night Frémont withdrew toward Harrisonburg.|$|E

25|$|The {{rescue effort}} was {{hampered}} by the weather, terrain, and other problems. Emergency vehicles could not approach due to a fuel pipeline destroyed by the crash and blocking the <b>narrow</b> <b>road.</b> United States Navy Seabees of NMCB133 {{were some of the}} first on the scene as they utilized their earth moving equipment to clear roadways and timber from the crash site approach. The Seabees used backhoes to crack open the still-burning plane to rescue survivors and erected mortuary tents for first responders. There was confusion over the administration of the effort; the crash occurred on land owned by the United States Navy but civil authorities initially claimed authority. The hull had disintegrated, and jet fuel in the wing tanks had sparked a fire which was still burning eight hours after impact.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Bendix's 7th New York Volunteer Infantry {{had opened}} fire on Colonel Frederick Townsend's 3rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, who were coming up the <b>narrow</b> <b>road</b> from the {{direction}} of Hampton to the south. The 3rd New York Infantry was being led down the road by General Peirce and his staff on horseback without an advance guard. Bendix knew that no cavalry was with the Union force and mistook the 3rd New York for a Confederate cavalry regiment. More importantly, the 3rd New York Infantry wore gray uniforms, with white bands on their arms such as had been seen previously on the hats, at least, of Confederates. Bendix, who had not been given the watchword or the instructions on armbands, thought the Confederates were behind his regiment as well as in front and ordered his men to fire upon Townsend's men.|$|E
25|$|The slow {{withdrawal}} and narrow roads kept {{the last of}} the Confederate force from reaching Five Forks until midmorning. When the Confederates reached Five Forks, they began to improve the trenches and fortifications, including establishing a return or refusal of the line running north of the left or eastern side of their trenches. While attention was given to improving the refused left flank, Pickett did not have the earthwork line that had been initially constructed when his men had reached Five Forks much improved when his men returned from Dinwiddie Court House. Not only did the line consist only of slim pine logs with a shallow ditch in front but Pickett's disposition of forces was poor. The cavalry in particular were placed in wooded areas inundated by heavy streams so that they could only move to the front by a <b>narrow</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
