60|$|Until now, {{the subject}} of these mirthful attacks had listened like one too {{confident}} of his established reputation to feel concern; but {{at the sound of}} the last speaker's voice, he grasped the bushy covering of one entire cheek in his hand, and turning a reproachful and irritated glance at the already half-repentant eye of Faith Ring, all his <b>natural</b> <b>spirit</b> returned.|$|E
6000|$|At six, I said, he was {{a charming}} child, [...] At twelve {{he was a}} fine, but quiet boy; [...] Although in infancy a little wild, [...] They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy [...] His <b>natural</b> <b>spirit</b> not in vain they toil'd, [...] At least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy [...] Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady, [...] Her young philosopher was grown already.|$|E

"Nay, in truth," [...] {{said the}} father, [...] "she has strange {{influence}} over those who approach her; the Highland lad, Conachar, with whom I have been troubled {{for these two}} or three years, although you may see he has the <b>natural</b> <b>spirit</b> of his people, obeys the least sign which Catharine makes him, and, indeed, will hardly be ruled by any {{one else in the}} house. She takes much pains with him to bring him from his rude Highland habits." ...|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "dear old one" [...] was fain to journey {{like the}} rest on horseback, {{but she was so}} well {{accustomed}} to that mode of locomotion that she suffered much less than might have been expected. Besides, her son had taken care to secure for her the quietest, meekest, and most easy-going horse belonging to the tribe--a creature whose <b>natural</b> <b>spirit</b> had been reduced by hardship and age to absolute quiescence, and whose gait had been trained down to something like a hobby-horse amble.|$|E
60|$|The {{answer was}} in the affirmative, and {{the eyes of the}} whole party turned towards the subject of this remark. The young lady in {{question}} was about twenty, rather tall for an American woman, not conspicuously handsome, but like most around her of delicate features and frame, and with such a physique, as, under proper training, would have rendered her the beau idéal of feminine delicacy and gentleness. She had <b>natural</b> <b>spirit,</b> likewise, as appeared in her clear blue eye, and moreover she had the spirit to be a belle.|$|E
50|$|Kimpurusha Kingdom {{refers to}} the {{territory}} of a tribe called Kimpurushas who were one among the Exotic Tribes of Ancient India. These exotic tribes lived in inaccessible regions like the Himalaya mountains and had limited interaction with the Vedic civilization of ancient India.

50|$|Alternatively a cruder, but {{sometimes}} more powerful, form of magic can be harnessed by using or capturing <b>natural</b> <b>spirits</b> of the land, elements, people or animals.

60|$|Pip swore a frightful {{oath that}} {{he was sure of}} it already; and the anecdote, being told, was {{received}} with loud applause, as an incontestable proof of Mr Jonas's greatness. Pip, in a <b>natural</b> <b>spirit</b> of emulation, then related some instances of his own depth; and Wolf not to be left behind-hand, recited the leading points of one or two vastly humorous articles he was then preparing. These lucubrations being of what he called 'a warm complexion,' were highly approved; and all the company agreed that they were full of point.|$|E

[...] "We follow the pursuit, Captain Ludlow, in which accident has cast our fortunes. You serve a Queen you never saw, and a nation who will use you in her need and despise you in her prosperity; and I serve myself. Let reason decide between us." ...|$|E
60|$|Vivian's first {{thoughts}} {{were for the}} Baroness; and turning his head from Beckendorff, he looked with the eye of anxious love to his companion. But, instead of fainting, instead of being overwhelmed by this terrible interruption, she seemed, on the contrary, to have suddenly regained her <b>natural</b> <b>spirit</b> and self-possession. The blood had returned to her hitherto pale cheek, and the fire to an eye before dull with weeping. She extricated herself immediately from Vivian's encircling arm, and by so doing enabled him to have struggled, had it been necessary, more equally with the powerful grasp of his assailant.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is {{of a very}} affectionate disposition. She is frank, outspoken, and natural--qualities {{that are}} wonderful, {{considering}} the years she has passed as a slave in the harem. Now {{that she has been}} with us for a fortnight, and has recovered from the fatigue of her flight, and is beginning to feel at home, she has regained her <b>natural</b> <b>spirits,</b> after their long repression.|$|R

6000|$|... "And that is true,"--said Sir Mungo; [...] "yet, were I {{ten years}} younger, I would {{be tempted to}} stand by you, and gie them the meeting. But at threescore and upward, men's courage turns cauldrife; and they that canna win a living, must not endanger the small {{sustenance}} of their age. I wish you weel through, my lord, {{but it is an}} unequal fight." [...] So saying, he turned and limped away; often looking back, however, as if his <b>natural</b> <b>spirit,</b> even in its present subdued state, aided by his love of contradiction and of debate, rendered him unwilling to adopt the course necessary for his own security.|$|E
6000|$|How terrible {{was this}} {{statement}} {{as to the}} affairs of the firm, coming, as it did, from the senior partner, who not more than twelve months since entered the business with a sum of four thousand pounds in hard cash! Robinson, whose <b>natural</b> <b>spirit</b> in such matters was sanguine and buoyant, felt that even he was depressed. Had four thousand pounds gone, and was there no profit? He knew well that the stock on hand would not even pay the debts that were due. The shop had always been full, and the men and women at the counter had always been busy. The books had nominally been kept by himself; but who can keep the books of a concern, if he be left in ignorance as to the outgoings and incomings? ...|$|E
60|$|It was his father's plan, and not his own, that {{he should}} marry Queen Mary. His father was at this time the most wealthy and {{powerful}} monarch in Europe. His name was Charles. He is commonly called in history Charles V. of Spain. He was not only King of Spain, but Emperor of Germany. He resided sometimes at Madrid, and sometimes at Brussels in Flanders. His son Philip had been married to a Portuguese princess, but his wife had died, and thus Philip was a widower. Still, he was only twenty-seven years of age, but he was as stern, severe, and repulsive in his manners as Mary. His personal appearance, too, corresponded with his character. He was a very decided Catholic also, and in his <b>natural</b> <b>spirit,</b> haughty, ambitious, and domineering.|$|E

The Mystics summon <b>natural</b> <b>spirits</b> called [...] "Origin". They were created by the Source Forge, the world's {{creation}} located inside Demiurge Tower, along with three magical stones (Aqualith, Pyrolith and Aerolith). In the town of Kravia, mystics went on a rampage, leaving the crater as a trace. Under the castle sewers of Darakin connects to the underground cave of Kabel, the abandoned kingdom.|$|R
60|$|As {{he glanced}} round, {{with a look}} which he had endeavoured to compose to haughty indifference, his eye {{encountered}} mine, and, I thought, at the first glance sank beneath it. But he instantly rallied his <b>natural</b> <b>spirit,</b> and returned me one of those extraordinary looks, by which he could contort so strangely the wrinkles on his forehead. I started; but, angry at myself for my pusillanimity, I answered him by a look of the same kind, and catching the reflection of my countenance in a large antique mirror which stood before me, I started again at the real or imaginary resemblance which my countenance, at that moment, bore to that of Herries. Surely my fate is somehow strangely interwoven with that of this mysterious individual. I had no time at present to speculate upon the subject, for the subsequent conversation demanded all my attention.|$|E
6000|$|I was {{the eldest}} of the three, [...] And to uphold and cheer the rest [...] 70 [...] I ought to do--and did my best-- [...] And each did well in his degree.

60|$|Although Joe {{gave himself}} up {{completely}} to {{his love for}} his bride, he did not forget that Kate was {{in the power of}} the renegade, and that he must rescue her. Knowing Girty had the unfortunate girls somewhere near the Delaware encampment, he resolved to find the place. Plans of all kinds he resolved in his mind. The best one he believed lay through Whispering Winds. First to find the whereabouts of Girty; kill him if possible, or at least free Kate, and then get away with her and his Indian bride. Sanguine as he invariably was, he could not but realize the peril of this undertaking. If Whispering Winds betrayed her people, it meant death to her as well as to him. He would far rather spend the remaining days of his life in the Indian village, than doom the maiden whose love had saved him. Yet he thought he might succeed in getting away with her, and planned to that end. His <b>natural</b> <b>spirit,</b> daring, reckless, had gained while he was associated with Wetzel.|$|E

50|$|Buddhism in Thailand is {{strongly}} influenced by traditional beliefs regarding ancestral and <b>natural</b> <b>spirits,</b> which have been incorporated into Buddhist cosmology.

These spirit houses can be found in public places and on the streets of Thailand, where the public make offerings.|$|R
