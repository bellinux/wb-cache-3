The novel feature in this scheme is that an SME element should be preliminary given the uniaxial pseudoplastic tensile straining. This operation promotes the martensite twins formation along the stretching axis and results in the maximal longitudinal deformation of SME element. Such scheme provides a well-controlled high reversible bending deformation of the composite, though only one-way SME of the material is used.

This however, represents a huge challenge for dental technicians who have to regard many key features of technical casting, {{especially when it comes to}} aspects of fluidity and casting capacity. In order to analyze the impact of the process parameters preheating – and casting temperature on the outflow characteristics of three EMF – alloys for partial dentures (WIRONIT, WIRONIT LA, WIRONIUM PLUS; BEGO company) as well as of three PFM alloys (WIROBOND C, WIROBOND LFC, WIRON 99; BEGO company) this work applied a test specimen according to HÄßELBARTH (modified wax retention grid). In the context of the casting experiments with the <b>non</b> precious <b>alloys</b> mentioned above, a series of experiments has been conducted with a set of 6 test – specimen to produce a total of 180 testing meshes. During theses tests the heating muffles have been preheated on the one hand intensely at + 100 °C and on the other hand lowly at - 100 °C. Furthermore, the casting temperature has been risen to + 100 °C as well as lowered to a minimum of - 100 °C. The tests conducted were compared to results that were made according to manufacturer instructions. Concluding the analysis of the results: - The reference block according to HÄßELBARTH allows the quantitative comparison of the used <b>non</b> precious <b>alloys</b> with varying process parameters such as preheating – and casting temperatures. Within the experiments intermediate form – filling rates between 16 % – 86 % have been achieved. No test mesh poured out to either 0 % or 100 %! - The experiments revealed a typical grouping of the alloys according to their formation. At a temperature of + 100 °C the EMF – alloys for partial dentures WIRONIT, WIRONIT LA, WIRONIUM PLUS showed significantly higher form – filling rates than the analyzed PFM alloys. - The configuration of the casting temperature is by far more important to the form filling process than the variation of the muffle temperature. This can be proven mathematically by the formula for the calculation of the cooling time. The results gained from this work show that the construction materials used in the EMF – alloys have a huge potential that can be further exploited in terms of better form fillings through the optimization of preheating and casting temperatures during the casting process. That is why dental precision castings can be improved dramatically. However, other factors that affect the quality of the component parts such as the mechanical characteristic hardness or elastic limit of 0, 2 % should not be neglected. The question remains open whether there is a way to estimate the optimal marginal value or proportion that manages to avoid affecting the texture and degrading mechanical parameters of the component parts while casting and preheating temperatures are changed. First and foremost the here gathered information confirm and imply that dental technicians should always stick to the specifications of manufacturers...|$|R

40|$|This review {{deals with}} the kinetic and {{thermodynamic}} fragility of bulk metallic glass forming liquids. The experimental methods to determine the kinetic fragility, relaxation behavior and thermodynamic functions of undercooled metallic liquids are introduced. Existing data are assessed and discussed using the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation and in the frameworks of the Adam-Gibbs {{as well as the}} Cohen-Turnbull free volume approach. In contrast to pure metals and most <b>non</b> glass forming <b>alloys,</b> bulk glass formers are moderately strong liquids. In general the fragility parameter $D^{*} $ increases with the complexity of the alloy with differences between the alloy families, e. g. noble-metal based alloys being more fragile than Zr-based alloys. At least some bulk metallic glass forming liquids, such as Vitreloy 1, undergo transitions from a fragile state at high temperatures to a strong state at low temperatures with indications that in Zr-based alloys this behavior is a common phenomenon. Comment: This paper was presented at the Symposium on Fragility, Bangalore, 2014, dedicated to Austen Angell for his 80 th birthday and published in a special volume on Fragility of Glass-forming Liquids, ed. A. L. Greer, K. F. Kelton, and S. Sastry (Hindustan Book Agency, New Delhi, 2014...|$|R
40|$|The phase {{transformations in}} a {{stoichiometric}} and <b>non</b> stoichiometric NiAl <b>alloy</b> under irradiation are theoretically investigated by molecular dynamics MD simulation technique with many body interatomic potentials. The kinetics {{of the transition}} of an initially B 2 or bcc lattice structure is modelled under thermal conditions and {{under the influence of}} a thermal heat spike originating from the slowing down of a swift ion. The results are discussed with respect to lattice changes by projection of the lattice position and with respect to the order disorder changes by means of a radial distribution function. It is shown that the spike in duced a liquid like structure. For the non stoichiometric Ni 62 Al 38 alloy the B 2 L 10 martensitic transition could be verified. The equilibrium martensitic L 10 phase cannot be reached in ion tracks on the first stage, when diffusion in a solid does not play a role. Sine like lattice oscillations are transformed into a sequence of kink like excitations soliton lattice. The character of formed domain structure and the kinetics of the transition depends on the presence of a trac...|$|R
