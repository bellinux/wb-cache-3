5|$|Some {{forms of}} goitre are {{associated}} with pain, whereas many do not cause any symptoms. Enlarged goitres may extend beyond the <b>normal</b> <b>position</b> of the thyroid gland to below the sternum, around the airway or esophagus. Goitres {{may be associated with}} hyperthyoidism or hypothyroidism, relating to the underlying cause of the goitre. Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre. The underlying cause of the goitre may be treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are simply monitored.|$|E
5|$|During El Niño events, {{increased}} precipitation {{is expected}} in California due to a more southerly, zonal, storm track. During the Niño portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal, and more southerly, polar jet stream. Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season. The subtropical jet stream across the deep tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is normal, and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward, or north, of its <b>normal</b> <b>position,</b> which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its <b>normal</b> <b>position</b> and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTooth {{transposition}} is a positional interchange of two adjacent teeth. Transposition {{most often}} occurs at maxillary canine. Moving transposed teeth to their <b>normal</b> <b>positions</b> is challenging because this requires bodily movement and translation of one tooth to pass another. This procedure may cause {{damage to the}} teeth or supporting structures. We report a case of complete transposition of maxillary canine and lateral incisor. Transposed teeth were successfully moved orthodontically to their <b>normal</b> <b>positions.</b> Multiple mechanics were meticulously applied to achieve complete correction of the tooth positions and to minimize root resorption and/or periodontal defects of canine and lateral incisors. Factors concerning treatment planning for transposed teeth are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Catalog of 5,268 Standard Stars Based on the Normal System N30 is the 1952 {{auxiliary}} {{star catalogue}} created by Herbert Rollo Morgan to address proper motion inaccuracies in 19th century observations by converting contemporary catalogues from a mean epoch around 1900 (±0.1 yr) to epoch and equinox 1950.0. However, the positions {{were derived from}} more than 70 recent catalogs with epochs of observation between 1917 and 1949. The N30 system is independent from any other astrometric system. Independent proper motions were determined by comparing the 1930 <b>normal</b> <b>positions</b> with the <b>normal</b> <b>positions</b> at the mean epoch, 30 years earlier, in the Albany General Catalogue, corrected by Morgan in 1948. Its primary use is the incorporation of 19th century astronomical data into modern research, and includes Harvard photometric magnitude, Henry Draper (HD) spectral type, and proper motion.|$|R

We reconstruct rotationally symmetric objects by rotating these reference points. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} radiologic {{findings}} of <b>normal</b> <b>positioning,</b> malpositioning, and complications {{related to the}} more commonly used thoracic venous catheters. These include central venous catheters, long-term central venous access catheters, and pulmonary artery catheters. The radiologist {{plays an important role}} in the early recognition of the complications of these catheters. The daily practice of chest radiology is intimately related to the evaluation of the integrity and correct placement of thoracic venous catheters. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to review radiologic findings of <b>normal</b> <b>positioning,</b> malpositioning, and complications related to the more common devices used, including central venous catheters, long-term central venous access catheters, and pulmonary artery catheters. Many of the complications described are serious and may remain unrecognized for a long time; this may cause incorrect diagnosis and delayed treatment. The radiologist {{plays an important role in}} the early recognition of these complications. Malpositioning and complications often are more easily diagnosed with contrast-enhanced studies and computed tomography...|$|R
25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus (bloat) is {{a common}} condition in dogs in which the stomach fills with gas, and can become torsed. This requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent necrosis of the stomach wall and death of the dog. During surgery, the stomach is deflated and put back into its <b>normal</b> <b>position.</b> A gastropexy may be performed, whereby the stomach {{is attached to the}} body wall to prevent this condition from recurring. A splenectomy or partial gastrectomy may also be required.|$|E
25|$|The pubic {{symphysis}} widens slightly {{when the}} legs are stretched far apart. In sports where these movements are often performed, {{the risk of}} a pubic symphysis blockage is high, in which case, after completion of the movement, the bones at the symphysis do not realign correctly and can get jammed in a dislocated position. The resulting pain can be severe, especially when further strain is put upon the affected joint. In most cases, the joint can only be successfully reduced into its <b>normal</b> <b>position</b> by a trained medical professional.|$|E
25|$|Aboutrika's {{efforts with}} Ahly led to {{attention}} from the Egyptian national team, and he started the game against Trinidad and Tobago in a friendly match before the World Cup 2006 qualifiers on 31 March 2004 in Arab Contractors Stadium.

He started as an attacker, but was found to play better when he played his <b>normal</b> <b>position</b> behind the attackers in the midfield position. Aboutrika scored his first national goal in this game. He scored 5 goals in his first 6 appearances with Egypt in 2004 and 2005.|$|E
40|$|Time {{sequence}} {{signals of}} instantaneous longitudinal and normal velocity components at different longitudinal and <b>normal</b> <b>positions</b> in a {{turbulent boundary layer}} have been finely measured simultaneously by IFA 300 constant temperature anemometer and double-sensor hot-wire probe with sampling resolution higher than the frequency that corresponds to the smallest time scale of Kolmogorov dissipation scale before/after introducing artificial periodic blow/suction perturbation. The period-phase-average technique is applied to extract the periodic waveforms of artificial perturbation from instantaneous time sequence signals of longitudinal and normal turbulence background. Experimental investigation is carried out on the attenuation characteristics of periodic perturbation wave with different frequency along longitudinal direction and normal direction in a turbulent boundary layer. The amplitude distributions of longitudinal and normal disturbing velocity component for different perturbation frequencies are measured at different downstream and <b>normal</b> <b>positions</b> in turbulent boundary layer. The amplitude growth rate of artificial periodic perturbation wave is calculated according to flow instability theory. The experimental results are compared and in consistent with the theoretical and numerical results...|$|R

The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, the firing pin springs back to the <b>normal</b> <b>position.</b> The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} palaeontological {{indications}} of the grazing. In general, the <b>normal</b> <b>position</b> {{of the head}} can {{be determined by the}} angle between a vertical plane coinciding with the occiput of the cranium, which is always vertical, and a plane through the base of the cranium. A right or acute angle would indicate a head held high for browsing leaves at various heights. Elasmotherium had the most obtuse angle of the Rhinocerotids. It could only reach the lowest levels and therefore must have grazed habitually. This morphological feature favours the identification of the one-horned beast depicted in Rouffignac Cave (shown in this article) as Elasmotherium and lends some validity to the bison-like restorations based on it.|$|E
25|$|A {{technical}} {{concern is}} that the 14 MeV neutrons produced by the fusion reactions will damage the materials from which the reactor is built. Research is in progress to determine whether and how reactor walls can be designed to last long enough to make a commercial power station economically viable {{in the presence of the}} intense neutron bombardment. The damage is primarily caused by high energy neutrons knocking atoms out of their <b>normal</b> <b>position</b> in the crystal lattice. A related problem for a future commercial fusion power station is that the neutron bombardment will induce radioactivity in the reactor material itself. Maintaining and decommissioning a commercial reactor may thus be difficult and expensive. Another problem is that superconducting magnets are damaged by neutron fluxes. A new special research facility, IFMIF, is planned to investigate this problem.|$|E
