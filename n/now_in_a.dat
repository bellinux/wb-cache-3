5|$|After Watson's death, {{the hotel}} lost its {{popularity}} to the rival Taj Hotel. In the 1960s {{the hotel was}} closed. Sometime after this, it was subdivided and partitioned into small cubicles with independent access and let out on rent. Over the years, apathy toward the building by the residents has resulted the building decaying, and it is <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dilapidated state. The atrium was subsequently used as a dumping ground and has several illegal constructions. , building had 53 families and 97 commercial establishments.

The Turks were <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to observe and bring fire down on Monash Valley. However, from another section of the post Private Albert Jacka led a small group of men in a counter-attack on the Turks. Jacka shot five of the Turks, bayoneted another two, and chased the rest out of the post. For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1815, Bute had his Glamorgan estates fully surveyed, which {{highlighted}} that the estates had been neglected {{for many years}} and were <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor condition. Edward Richards became the senior official in charge of the estates by 1824 and represented Bute on both estate and political affairs across the region. Despite this, Bute retained the final authority over even quite minor issues on the estates, including making decisions on the buttons to be used on local school uniforms or the reuse of a broken flag pole, for example, which could result in considerable delays as letters were sent between South Wales and Scotland. As the complexity of the Glamorgan estates grew, more officials were appointed to help manage the docks, farms and mineral interests, but these all reported separately to Bute, putting increasing pressure on the marquess.|$|E
5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor condition and {{that as a result}} he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Henry's burial at Reading Abbey {{is marked}} by a local cross, but Reading Abbey was slowly {{demolished}} during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century.

5|$|Nagumo was <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> quandary. Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, leading Carrier Division 2 (Hiryū and Sōryū), {{recommended}} that Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand: 18 Aichi D3A1 dive bombers each on Sōryū and Hiryū, {{and half the}} ready cover patrol aircraft. Nagumo's opportunity to hit the American ships was now limited by the imminent return of his Midway strike force. The returning strike force needed to land promptly or {{it would have to}} ditch into the sea. Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese never had an opportunity to position ("spot") their reserve planes on the flight deck for launch.|$|E
5|$|Scully is {{approached}} by the Dark Figure, who is {{revealed to be}} a Seraph, an angel who descended from the heavens and fathered four children with a mortal woman. God sent the Seraph to return the girls to Heaven {{in order to keep}} the Devil from claiming them as his own. Scully and Starkey find the fourth girl, Roberta Dyer (Perkins) at Gregory's church. However, Scully sees Starkey's horned shadow, revealing his true origins. Scully tries to help Roberta escape, but the women are confronted by the Seraph. She reluctantly lets go of Roberta's hand, after seeing Emily in place of Roberta, and lets her enter Heaven. Later, Scully tells Mulder they should have been protecting the girls from Starkey, not Gregory. She also believes that they are <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> place where they were meant to be.|$|E

5|$|The Royalists, while losing fewer soldiers, were <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{precarious}} position, since reinforcements from Chester {{were needed}} {{to follow up on}} the success and defeat Poyntz's force. As such, Langdale sent Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Shakerley to report to Charles, requesting reinforcements. Shakerley arrived in Chester and delivered his message after 15 minutes, but no orders were issued for a further six hours after that. Barratt speculates that one reason could have been the fatigue of the Royalist troops, and another the rivalries amongst the Royalist commanders: Gerard and Digby opposed each other, with other commanders disliking Langdale; and Charles not being strong enough to stop the disputes. The Parliamentarians, however, did send support: at approximately 2:00pm, the Chester forces dispatched 350 horse and 400 musketeers under Colonels Michael Jones and John Booth to reinforce Poyntz.|$|E
5|$|The film's set {{designers}} Eugène Lourié and Max Douy built one of {{the most}} expensive sets in French film history at the Joinville Studio. According to Douy they were based on the script and were not reproductions of the interior of Chateau de la Ferté-Saint-Aubin, where exterior scenes were shot. The music boxes used in the film were borrowed from several sources and some are <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> museum in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Renoir thought the musical organ scene and Dalio's performance in it was the best scene he had ever filmed. He shot the scene several times before he was satisfied with it. The costumes for the film were designed by Coco Chanel.|$|E
