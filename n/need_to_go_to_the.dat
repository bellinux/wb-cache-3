25|$|Kỳ {{then decided}} to allow Thi to return to Da Nang, the largest city {{in the region and}} the second largest in the country on March 16, ostensibly to restore order. Kỳ claimed that he allowed Thi to return to his old area of command as a {{goodwill}} gesture, to keep central Vietnamese happy, and because he promised Thi a farewell visit before going into exile. Given Thi's popularity, Kỳ's gesture was regarded as a political gamble. In any case, Thi made a tongue-in-cheek speech, filled with sarcastic references about his <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US for healthcare.|$|E

According to Kalefa Sanneh of The New York Times, [...] "Drama" [...] sets her [...] "rapid-fire monologue atop a sublime, head-nodding hip-hop beat." [...] On [...] "Tuya Soy", (I'm Yours) she explains [...] "the story of woman who suspects her husband of infidelity", a controversial theme which has been prominent in Queen's lyrical content. [...] "Bésame", (Kiss Me) is an evocative theme, expressing the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dance floor with the guy she like. [...] "Me Acostumbré" [...] (I Got Accustomed) and [...] "Dile Que Ya" [...] (Tell Him Okay) are [...] "hip-hop ballads".

During the tongue-in-cheek speech, he made sarcastic references about his <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US for health treatment. He told a journalist that he would accept [...] "any position which is useful for the country", leading some {{to think that he}} wanted Kỳ or Thiệu's job. According to Time magazine, Thi's speeches showed he [...] "was obviously torn between a desire to rally support for a comeback and his soldier's distaste for adding to dissension".

500|$|An {{effect of}} the Civil War and {{resulting}} Commonwealth of England, particularly the [...] "liberal" [...] values and feelings it stirred up, was the continuous modernisation and improvement of the common law courts, something that reduced the interference of the Lord Chancellor in common law matters, except in areas where they had wildly divergent principles and law. Under Charles II, for the first time, there was a type of common law appeal where {{the nature of the}} evidence in the initial trial was taken into account, which reduced the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Court of Chancery. As a result, the nature of the Court of Chancery changed; rather than being a major corrective system for the common law, it became primarily concerned with the administration and protection of rights, as opposed to the common law courts, which were mainly concerned with the remedy and retribution of problems. This was further enforced by the Statute of Frauds, which confirmed Chancery principles across the board, allowing people to receive the same treatment in the common law courts {{as they did in the}} Chancery.|$|E

[...] He ended up winning the gold medal, coming first. He did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hospital but did require medical treatment for 25 minutes after he finished.

2500|$|An {{example of}} how {{foreseeability}} {{does not apply to}} the extent of an injury is the eggshell skull rule. [...] If Neal punched Matt in the jaw, it is foreseeable that Matt will suffer a bodily injury that he will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hospital for. [...] However, if his jaw is very weak, and his jaw comes completely off from my punch, then the doctor bills, which would have been about $5,000 for wiring his jaw shut had now become $100,000 for a full-blown jaw re-attachment. [...] Neal would still be liable for the entire $100,000, even though $95,000 of those damages were not reasonably foreseeable.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{children}} {{no longer}} wear diapers when past {{two to four}} years of age, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child's personality. [...] However, it is becoming increasingly common for children as old as five to still be wearing diapers because of their parents' neglect or the child's opposition to toilet training. [...] This can pose a number of problems if the child is sent to school wearing diapers, including teasing from classmates and health issues resulting from soiled diapers. [...] Teachers' groups—who are attributing the epidemic to an increase in full-time day care use—are requesting that diapered children be banned from the classroom. [...] The disposable diaper industry has been accused of encouraging this trend by manufacturing diapers in increasingly larger sizes. [...] "uper-comfortable diapers" [...] have also been criticized; the advanced technology in modern diapers wick wetness away from skin, leaving the child oblivious to their accident and when they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> toilet. [...] Paediatric nurse June Rogers claims that the attitude of parents {{plays a major role in}} the problem, and that toilet training is simply not a priority for many of them.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s Bunin, having become {{interested}} in the new Soviet literature, in particular the works of Aleksandr Tvardovsky and Konstantin Paustovsky, entertained plans of returning to the Soviet Union, as Aleksandr Kuprin had done in the 1930s. In 1946, speaking to his Communist counterparts in Paris, Bunin praised the Supreme Soviet's decision to return Soviet citizenship to Russian exiles in France, still stopping short of saying [...] "yes" [...] to the continuous urging from the Soviet side for him to return. [...] "It is hard for an old man {{to go back to}} places where he's pranced goat-like in better times. Friends and relatives are all buried... That for me would be a graveyard trip," [...] he reportedly said to Zhukov, promising though, to [...] "think more of it." [...] Financial difficulties and the French reading public's relative indifference to the publication of Dark Avenues figured high among his motives. [...] "Would you mind asking the Union of Writers to send me {{at least some of the}} money for books that've been published and re-issued in Moscow in the 1920s and 1930s? I am weak, I am short of breath, I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South but am too skinny to even dream of it," [...] Bunin wrote to Nikolay Teleshov in a 19 November 1946, letter.|$|E
6000|$|November 12.--Went to sit to Sir T.L. {{to finish}} the picture for his Majesty, which every one says is a very fine one. I think so myself; and wonder how Sir Thomas has made so much out of an old weather-beaten block. But I believe the hard {{features}} of old Dons like myself are more within the compass of the artist's skill than the lovely face and delicate complexion of females. Came home after a heavy shower. I had a long conversation about ------ with Lockhart. All that was whispered is true--a sign how much better our domestics are acquainted with the private affairs of our neighbours than we are. A dreadful tale of incest and seduction, and nearly of blood also--horrible beyond expression in its complications and events--"And yet the end is not;"--and this man was amiable, and seemed the soul of honour--laughed, too, and was the soul of society. It is a mercy our own thoughts are concealed from each other. Oh! if, at our social table, we could see what passes in each bosom around, we would seek dens and caverns to shun human society! To see the projector trembling for his falling speculations; the voluptuary rueing the event of his debauchery; the miser wearing out his soul {{for the loss of}} a guinea--all--all bent upon vain hopes and vainer regrets--we should not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall of the Caliph Vathek to see men's hearts broiling under their black veils.[402] Lord keep us from all temptation, for we cannot be our own shepherd! ...|$|E

60|$|Dale {{had gotten}} the hound as a pup from a Mexican sheep-herder who claimed he was part California bloodhound. He grew up, {{becoming}} attached to Dale. In his younger days {{he did not get}} along well with Dale's other pets and Dale gave him to a rancher down in the valley. Pedro was back in Dale's camp next day. From that day Dale began to care more for the hound, but {{he did not want to}} keep him, for various reasons, chief of which was the fact that Pedro was too fine a dog to be left alone half the time to shift for himself. That fall Dale had <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farthest village, Snowdrop, where he left Pedro with a friend. Then Dale rode to Show Down and Pine, and the camp of the Beemans' and with them he trailed some wild horses for a hundred miles, over into New Mexico. The snow was flying when Dale got back to his camp in the mountains. And there was Pedro, gaunt and worn, overjoyed to welcome him home. Roy Beeman visited Dale that October and told that Dale's friend in Snowdrop had not been able to keep Pedro. He broke a chain and scaled a ten-foot fence to escape. He trailed Dale to Show Down, where one of Dale's friends, recognizing the hound, caught him, and meant to keep him until Dale's return. But Pedro refused to eat. It happened that a freighter was going out to the Beeman camp, and Dale's friend boxed Pedro up and put him on the wagon. Pedro broke out of the box, returned to Show Down, took up Dale's trail to Pine, and then on to the Beeman camp. That was as far as Roy could trace the movements of the hound. But he believed, and so did Dale, that Pedro had trailed them out on the wild-horse hunt. The following spring Dale learned more from the herder of a sheepman at whose camp he and the Beemans; had rested on the way into New Mexico. It appeared that after Dale had left this camp Pedro had arrived, and another Mexican herder had stolen the hound. But Pedro got away.|$|E
