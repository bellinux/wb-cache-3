5|$|In May 1948, {{while he}} was holding church {{meetings}} throughout Navajo and Apache communities in Arizona, Kimball suffered severe chest pain from a myocardial infarction, {{also known as a}} heart attack, after he had spent an afternoon struggling to lift an automobile out of deep sand. Kimball was physically sluggish {{throughout the rest of the}} trip, and after he had returned to Salt Lake City and undergone an electrocardiogram, his physician prescribed one month of rest from his church duties. Kimball was only 53 and had considered himself to be generally healthy and fit; he persuaded his physician not to tell the other apostles or the First Presidency. However, on his next assignment, in Rigby, Idaho, Kimball again experienced chest pains, which escalated into another heart attack several days after his return. During the early episodes, Kimball passed the time by discussing his wishes regarding the family's finances and investments with his wife in case he did not survive the infarctions. After receiving a priesthood blessing from church president George Albert Smith, Kimball spent two months on bed rest followed by two weeks resting on the <b>Navajo</b> <b>Nation.</b> At his physician's urging, he spent several additional weeks recuperating with his wife near the seashore in Long Beach, California. A cardiologist that Kimball consulted in California believed that his heart had been weakened by an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever during childhood and instructed Kimball to avoid overwork and gaining unnecessary weight.|$|E

50|$|Various {{examples}} of affirmative racial gerrymandering have emerged. When {{the state legislature}} considered representation for Arizona's Native American reservations, they thought each needed their own House member, because of historic conflicts between the Hopi and <b>Navajo</b> <b>nations.</b> Since the Hopi reservation is completely surrounded by the Navajo reservation, the legislature created an unusual district configuration for the 2nd congressional district that featured a fine filament along a river course several hundred miles in length to attach the Hopi reservation {{to the rest of}} the district; the arrangement lasted until 2013. The California state legislature created a congressional district (2003-2013) that extended over a narrow coastal strip for several miles. It ensured that a common community of interest will be represented, rather than having portions of the coastal areas be split up into districts extending into the interior, with domination by inland concerns.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, the Hopi filmmaker and {{photographer}} Victor Masayesva Jr. has played an influential role in Native American multimedia {{production in the}} United States. This article examines Masayesva's film Paatuwaqatsi: Water, Land and Life (2007), which documents a 1, 650 -mile run made by Hopis from their home villages in Northern Arizona to Mexico City in early 2006. The run marked {{the closure of the}} Mohave Generating Station in southern Nevada and the Black Mesa coal mine which fuelled the power plant. It also celebrated the shutting down of the controversial coal slurry pipeline between the plant and mine that required for its operation the pumping of 1. 2 billion gallons of pristine water annually from the Navajo Aquifer, which lies under the homelands of the Hopi and <b>Navajo</b> <b>nations.</b> The article explains how Hopis' affective relationship with place is put into action through the acts of running, prayer and personal sacrifice. It reviews Masayesva?s filmmaking career to date and considers his core idea of the indigenous aesthetic, a set of principles that has guided the practical decisions and artistic choices he has made in the course of over thirty years' working as an independent media producer. After a close analysis of selected scenes in Paatuwaqatsi, the article concludes by noting, first, how the film negotiates internal divisions within Hopi society over development and environmental issues and, second, how it engages the impact of continuing drought and ongoing climate change on the American Southwest.

25|$|The {{swastika}} motif {{is found}} in some traditional Native American art and iconography. Historically, the design {{has been found in}} excavations of Mississippian-era sites in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, and on objects associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (S.E.C.C.). It is also widely used by a number of southwestern tribes, most notably the <b>Navajo,</b> and plains <b>nations</b> such as the Dakota. Among various tribes, the swastika carries different meanings. To the Hopi it represents the wandering Hopi clan; to the Navajo it is one symbol for the whirling log (tsil no'oli), a sacred image representing a legend that is used in healing rituals. A brightly colored First Nations saddle featuring swastika designs is on display at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Canada.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{many areas}} of the world, only 30 to 50 % of dogs are vaccinated against rabies. On some US Indian Reservations, {{vaccination}} rates may be as low as 5 to 20 %. In 2003 and 2004, we evaluated the effectiveness of commercially available baits to deliver oral rabies vaccine to feral and free-ranging dogs on the <b>Navajo</b> and Hopi <b>Nations.</b> Dogs were offered one of the following baits containing a plastic packet filled with placebo vaccine: vegetable shortening-based Ontario slim baits (Artemis Technologies, Inc.), fish-meal-crumble coated sachets (Merial, Ltd.), dog food polymer baits (Bait-Tek, Inc.), or fish meal polymer baits (Bait-Tek, Inc.). One bait was offered to each animal and its behaviour toward the bait was recorded. Behaviours included: bait ignored, bait swallowed whole, bait chewed and discarded (sachet intact), bait chewed and discarded (sachet punctured), or bait chewed and consumed (sachet punctured). Bait acceptance ranged from 30. 7 % to 77. 8 % with the fish-meal-crumble coated sachets having the highest acceptance rate of the tested baits...|$|R
5000|$|The ACCIP was {{especially}} important {{as an advocate}} for California’s terminated and unacknowledged tribes in receiving federal acknowledgment. In 1978, the Secretary of the Interior established the Federal Acknowledgment Process (FAP) to consider the extension of federal recognition to previously unrecognized Indian groups. Among other things, the Federal Acknowledgment regulations required that the group petitioning for a federally recognized tribal status live in a distinct community, be identified as an Indian entity on a continuous basis, and prove its political influence over its members through its history and into the present day. The UCLA American Indian Studies Center compiled a report for the ACCIP in 1996 which argued that the historical conditions of California Indians rendered the FAP regulations inapplicable to them. The Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria made the same argument:This standard may reflect the historical realities of many tribes outside of California such as the <b>Navajo</b> or Sioux <b>Nations</b> and is therefore arguably a reasonable benchmark to apply to currently unrecognized Indian tribes seeking recognition [...] [...] [...] Such a requirement is not, however, a realistic standard for California tribes because of California’s unique and tragic history toward its Native population. As California tribes were split apart, survival, not governance, became {{the primary goal of}} the Coast Miwok, the Southern Pomo, and others [...] [...] [...]The UCLA American Indian Studies Center explains that before the United States acquired California in aftermath of the Mexican-American War, “the mission system significantly disrupted tribal living patterns and populations in California.” After California became a state, the United States concluded a total of eighteen treaties with the tribal groups of California in which a total of 8500000 acre of land was to be set aside for them. The treaties were never ratified, however, and many Indians were resettled onto small reservations or rancherias, while others continued to live on their ancestral homelands without federal protection.|$|R

25|$|Despite efforts made in {{cleaning}} up uranium sites, significant problems {{stemming from the}} legacy of uranium development still exist today on the <b>Navajo</b> <b>Nation</b> and in the states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. Hundreds of abandoned mines have not been cleaned up and present environmental and health risks in many communities. At {{the request of the}} U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in October 2007, and in consultation with the <b>Navajo</b> <b>Nation,</b> the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), along with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Indian Health Service (IHS), developed a coordinated Five-Year Plan to address uranium contamination.

25|$|However, data {{collected}} in 1980 showed that 85 percent of Navajo first-graders were bilingual, compared to 62 percent of Navajo of all ages– early {{evidence of a}} resurgence of use of their traditional language among younger people. In 1984, to counteract the language's historical decline, the <b>Navajo</b> <b>Nation</b> Council decreed that the Navajo language would be available and comprehensive for students of all grade levels in schools of the <b>Navajo</b> <b>Nation.</b> This effort was aided by the fact that, {{largely due to the}} work of Young and Morgan, Navajo is one of the best-documented Native American languages. In 1980 they published a monumental expansion of their work on the language, organized by word (first initial of vowel or consonant) in the pattern of English dictionaries, as requested by Navajo students. The Navajo Language: A Grammar and Colloquial Dictionary also included a 400-page grammar, making it invaluable for both native speakers and students of the language. Particularly in its organization of verbs, it was oriented to Navajo speakers. They expanded this work again in 1987, with several significant additions, and this edition continues to be used as an important text.|$|E
