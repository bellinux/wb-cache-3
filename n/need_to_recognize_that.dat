At a Christian Science Monitor breakfast in June 2012, Barbour suggested that the Republican Party should take a more moderate approach to certain elements of its platform. He suggested barring corporations and unions from making direct campaign contributions, expressed satisfaction with Mitt Romney's moderate brand of Republicanism, and suggested that the party should soften its stance on illegal immigration and reach out to Latino voters: [...] "We need a secure border for lots of reasons, and then we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> we're not going to deport 12 million people and we shouldn't." ...|$|E

50|$|The report observes that, {{faced with}} a moribund economy, some governments have been tempted to divert public {{resources}} towards commercial applications, {{to the detriment of}} basic research and public good science. They <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> ‘science powers commerce - but not only,’ advises one of the report’s authors. It is a question of balance. A sustained public investment in basic and high-risk research makes economic sense, since neglecting these areas leads to a smaller pool of new knowledge, which, in turn, means that there will be less science to commercialize in the years to come. Switzerland, for example, is a global innovation leader but also devotes about 30% of research expenditure to basic research.|$|E

40|$|International audienceRural village {{communities}} in England are commonly portrayed as being neighbourly and close-knit, with villagers perceived {{as having a}} deep-seated sense of local identity complemented by strong feelings of belonging. This narrow view obscures, and marginalizes, the experiences of minority ethnic residents who can often feel excluded from village life. This article assesses whether the process of ‘othering' that works to ostracize minority ethnic households {{is similar to that}} experienced by all ‘outsiders' who are newcomers to rural living. It is argued that the conflation of rurality with notions of Englishness and ‘whiteness' serves to reinforce this marginalization. Indeed, the scattered distribution of minority ethnic populations in the rural means that any understanding of these ‘communities' <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> they are not ‘communities of place' but instead are ‘communities of shared risk', as it is the risk of racist harassment that provides commonality, kinship and shared experience amongst these diverse populations...|$|R
50|$|A global {{supply chain}} manager <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> {{supplier}} performance is a crucial component of their business' success. A manager must recognize all the key components to building and maintaining a successful relationship which are: trust, communication, human asset specificity, and personal relationships. Trust {{is the basis of}} all business-supplier relationships and must be built over time. In order for the business and it's supplier to run successfully, there must be a mutual trust as success is dependent on both the business and the supplier. Communication is also a critical success factor. The flow of information between business and supplier is key in building a relationship and being successful. Businesses who implement the human asset specificity between themselves and their supplier have the benefits of higher levels of trust, better cost, quality and delivery performance. The human asset specificity is the communication and interaction of specific human assets within the business and the supplier. This means opening up communication between individuals in both the business and supplier who are link minded (e.g. engineer to engineer)7.|$|R

The double challenge is to eliminate the constraints on having children in the first place, and to ensure that the children we have are ensured optimal opportunities.

And like no other epoch in the past, the societal gains are mounting all-the-while that families’ ability to produce these social gains is weakening. In the following 1 analyze the twin challenges of fertility and child development. I then examine which kind of policy mix will ensure both the socially desired level of fertility and investment in our children?
