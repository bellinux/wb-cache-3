40|$|The {{processing}} of damaged DNA was altered in a mitomycin C-sensitive mutant (mtcA) of Micrococcus radiodurans. Even though the mutant retained resistance to 254 -nm UV radiation, it did not, {{in contrast to}} the wild-type strain, show any excessive DNA degradation or cell death when incubated with chloramphenicol after sublethal doses of either UV light or mitomycin C. The results suggest the constitutive synthesis of an enzyme system responsible for wild-type proficiency in the repair of mitomycin C-induced damage. An alternative system able to repair damage caused by mitomycin C was demonstrated in the mtcA background. In this strain, additional damage inflicted upon the cellular DNA effected a massive rescue of cells previously inactivated by mitomycin C. Rescue was provoked by ionizing radiation, by UV light, or by simple alkylating agents. Cells treated with psoralen plus <b>near-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> could be rescued only when inactivation was due primarily to psoralen-DNA interstrand cross-links rather than to monoadducts. The rescue of inactivated cells was prevented in the presence of chloramphenicol.

Escherichia coli exonuclease III permitted or improved long PCR amplification with DNA samples submitted to different in vitro treatments known to induce DNA strand breaks and/or apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, including high temperature (99 °C), depurination at low pH and <b>near-UV</b> <b>radiation.</b> Exonuclease III also permitted or improved amplification with DNA samples that had been isolated several years ago by the phenol/chloroform method. Amelioration of long PCR amplification was achieved for PCR products ranging in size from 5 to 15. 4 kb and with DNA target sequences located either within mitochondrial DNA or the nuclear genome. Exonuclease III increased the amplification of damaged templates using either rTth DNA polymerase alone or rTth plus Vent DNA polymerases or Taq plus Pwo DNA polymerases. However, exonuclease III could not improve PCR amplification from extensively damaged DNA samples.

The observed DNA damage profiles, i. e. the ratios of single-strand breaks, sites of base loss (AP sites) and base modifications sensitive to fonnamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (FPG protein) and endonuclease m, are similar to the DNA damage profile produced by hydroxyl radicals generated by lonizing radiation or by xanthine and xanthine oxidase in the presence of Fe(III) -EDTA. No such damage is observed with the corresponding furocoumarin alcohols or in the absence of <b>near-UV</b> <b>radiation.</b> The damage caused by the photo-excited hydroperoxides is not influenced by superoxide dismutase (SOD) or catalase or by D 2 O as solvent.

The cytotoxicity caused by one of the hydroperoxides in L 5178 Y mome lymphoma cells is found to be dependent on the near-UV irradiation and to be much higher than that of the corresponding alcohol.

40|$|In {{the search}} for life on Earth-like planets around other stars, the first (and likely only) {{information}} {{will come from the}} spectroscopic characterization of the planet's atmosphere. Of the countless number of chemical species terrestrial life produces, only a few have the distinct spectral features and the necessary atmospheric abundance to be detectable. The easiest of these species to observe in Earth's atmosphere is O_ 2 (and its photochemical byproduct, O_ 3). But O_ 2 can also be produced abiotically by photolysis of CO_ 2, followed by recombination of O atoms with each other. CO is produced in stoichiometric proportions. Whether O_ 2 and CO can accumulate to appreciable concentrations depends on the ratio of far-UV to <b>near-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> coming from the planet's parent star and on what happens to these gases when they dissolve in a planet's oceans. Using a one-dimensional photochemical model, we demonstrate that O_ 2 derived from CO_ 2 photolysis should not accumulate to measurable concentrations on planets around F- and G-type stars. K-star, and especially M-star planets, however, may build up O_ 2 because of the low near-UV flux from their parent stars, in agreement with some previous studies. On such planets, a 'false positive' for life is possible if recombination of dissolved CO and O_ 2 in the oceans is slow and if other O_ 2 sinks (e. g., reduced volcanic gases or dissolved ferrous iron) are small.

The extract was analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography {{and some of the}} adsorbed species were provisionally Identified by retention time matching. The adsorption of reactants on the catalyst surface was studied explicitly, particularly with respect to the effect of <b>near-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> on adsorption processes. Maximum and steady-state rates of the surface reactions are reported here as functions of the operating conditions. Deactivation of the catalyst surface is characterized and methods of regeneration of catalyst activity are explored. This established research methodology provides the framework for a broader outline of research into enhancement of indoor air quality via photocatalytlc oxidation. The results of investigations are discussed that pertain to a variety of classes of compounds representative of indoor air pollutants. IMPLICATIONS Photocatalytlc oxidation {{has the potential to be}} an effective process for removing and destroying low-level pollutants in air. A photocatalytic reactor traps and chemically oxidizes volatile organic compounds. converting them primarily to carbon dioxide and water. Photocatalytic reactors are also modular and may be scaled to suit a wide variety of indoor air quality applications. They operate at room temperature and with negligible pressure drop. and therefore may be readily integrated into new and existing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems...|$|E
40|$|We use new Herschel {{multiband}} imaging of the Andromeda galaxy {{to analyse}} how dust heating {{occurs in the}} central regions of galaxy spheroids that are essentially devoid of young stars. We construct a dust temperature map of M 31 through fitting modified blackbodies to the Herschel data, and find that the temperature within 2 &# 8201;kpc rises strongly from the mean value in the disc of 17 &# 0177; 1 to &# 8764; 35 &# 8201;K at the centre. Ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (IR) imaging of the central few kpc shows directly the absence of young stellar populations, delineates the radial profile of the stellar density and demonstrates that even the near-UV dust extinction is optically thin in M 31 's bulge. This allows the direct calculation of the stellar radiation heating in the bulge, U*(r), {{as a function of}} radius. The increasing temperature profile in the centre matches that expected from the stellar heating, i. e. that the dust heating and cooling rates track each other over nearly two orders of magnitude in U*. The modelled dust heating is in excess of the observed dust temperatures, suggesting that it is more than sufficient to explain the observed IR emission. Together with the wavelength-dependent absorption cross-section of the dust, this demonstrates directly that it is the optical, not UV, radiation that sets the heating rate. This analysis shows that neither young stellar populations nor stellar <b>near-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> is necessary to heat dust to warm temperatures in galaxy spheroids. Rather, it is the high densities of Gyr-old stellar populations that provide a sufficiently strong diffuse radiation field to heat the dust. To the extent which these results pertain to the tenuous dust found in the centres of early-type galaxies remains yet to be explored...|$|E
40|$|Planetary climate can be {{affected}} by the interaction of the host star spectral energy distribution with the wavelength-dependent reflectivity of ice and snow. Here we explore this effect using a one dimensional (1 -D), line-by-line, radiative-transfer model to calculate broadband planetary albedos as input to a seasonally varying, 1 -D energy-balance climate model. A three-dimensional general circulation model is also used to explore the atmosphere's response to changes in incoming stellar radiation, or instellation, and surface albedo. Using this hierarchy of models we simulate planets covered by ocean, land, and water ice of varying grain size, with incident radiation from stars of different spectral types. Terrestrial planets orbiting stars with higher <b>near-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> exhibit a stronger ice-albedo feedback. We find that ice-covered conditions occur on an F-dwarf planet with only a 2 % reduction in instellation relative to the present instellation on Earth, assuming fixed CO 2 (present atmospheric level on Earth). A similar planet orbiting the Sun at an equivalent flux distance requires an 8 % reduction in instellation, while a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star requires an additional 19 % reduction in instellation to become ice-covered, equivalent to 73 % of the modern solar constant. The surface ice-albedo feedback effect becomes less important at {{the outer edge of the}} habitable zone, where atmospheric CO 2 can be expected to be high in order to maintain clement conditions for surface liquid water. We show that 3 - 10 bars of CO 2 will entirely mask the climatic effect of ice and snow, leaving the outer limits of the habitable zone unaffected by the spectral dependence of water ice and snow albedo. However, less CO 2 is needed to maintain open water for a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star, than would be the case for hotter main-sequence stars.

40|$|Chinese hamster ovary {{cells were}} {{used to compare the}} {{cytotoxicity}} and mutagenicity of far-UV radiation emitted by a low-pressure mercury, germicidal lamp (wavelength predominantly 254 nm) with that of <b>near-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> emitted by a fluorescent lamp with a continuous spectrum (Westinghouse 'Sun Lamp'), of which only the radiation with wavelengths greater than 290 nm or greater than 310 nm was transmitted to the cells. The radiation effects were compared on the basis of an equal number of pyrimidine dimers, the predominant lesion induced in DNA by far-UV, for the induction of which much more energy is needed with near-UV than with 254 -nm radiation. The numbers of dimers induced were determined by a biochemical method detecting UV-endonuclease-susceptible sites. The equivalence of these sites with pyrimidine dimers was established, qualitatively and quantitatively, in studies with enzymic photoreactivation in vitro and chromatographic analysis of dimers. On the basis of induced dimers, more cells were killed by > 310 -nm UV than by > 290 -nm UV; both forms of radiation were more cytotoxic than 254 -nm UV when equal numbers of dimers were induced. Moreover, 5 - 6 times as many mutants were induced per dimer by > 310 -nm UV than by > 290 -nm UV; the latter appeared approximately as mutagenic as 254 -nm UV. The differences in lethality and mutagenicity were not caused by differences in repair of dimers: cells with an equal number of dimers induced by either 254 -nm or near-UV showed the same removal of sites susceptible to a UV endonuclease specific for dimers, as well as an identical amount of repair replication. The results indicate that near-UV induces, besides pyrimidine dimers, other lesions that appear to be of high biological significance.

40|$|Styler, Sarah A. Brigante, Marcello D'Anna, Barbara George, Christian Donaldson, D. J. This work {{presents}} the results of two complementary studies of the heterogeneous reaction of gas-phase ozone with solid pyrene films. In the first study, ozone uptake by the pyrene film was determined using a coated-wall flow tube system. In the second, pyrene loss within the film upon exposure to ozone was monitored using a laser-induced fluorescence technique. The dependence of the reactive loss rate on ozone concentration observed in both methods suggests that the reaction proceeds via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type surface mechanism. At a mixing ratio of 50 ppb, the steady-state reactive uptake coefficient of ozone by pyrene films increased from 5. 0 x 10 (- 6) in the dark to 3. 7 x 10 (- 5) upon exposure to <b>near-UV</b> <b>radiation</b> (300 - 420 nm). The uptake coefficient increased linearly as a function of UV-A spectral irradiance and decreased markedly with increasing relative humidity. The loss of surface pyrene upon exposure to ozone also displayed a light enhancement: analysis of Langmuir-Hinshelwood plots for the light and dark reactions revealed a small increase in the two-dimensional reaction rate in the presence of light (lambda 愦灭;gt;= 295 nm). This modest enhancement, however, was less significant than the corresponding enhancement in the loss of gas-phase ozone. In order to explain these observations, we present an integrated mechanism whereby the light-enhanced ozone uptake arises from the reaction of ozone with O- 2 ((1) Sigma(+) (g)) formed via energy transfer from excited-state pyrene and the enhanced pyrene loss occurs via the formation of a charge-transfer complex between excited-state pyrene and adsorbed ozone. The disparity between surface-and gas-phase results underscores the important role that multifaceted strategies can play in elucidating the mechanisms of heterogeneous atmospheric reactions...|$|E
