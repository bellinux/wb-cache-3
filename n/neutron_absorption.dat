Among those, 247Cm and 248Cm are popular in scientific research because of their long half-lives. However, the production rate of 247Cm in thermal neutron reactors is relatively low because of it is prone to undergo fission induced by thermal neutrons. Synthesis of 250Cm via <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption</b> is also rather unlikely because of the short half-life of the intermediate product 249Cm (64 min), which converts by β− decay to the berkelium isotope 249Bk.|$|E

Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption</b> cross-section in making control rods in nuclear reactors, for its high magnetic susceptibility in data storage applications, and as a component of Terfenol-D (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.|$|E

The resulting product was designated AGOT graphite ("Acheson Graphite Ordinary Temperature") by National Carbon. With a <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption</b> cross section of 4.97 mbarns, the AGOT graphite is considered as the first true nuclear-grade graphite.

Pure sodium metal also has many applications, including use in sodium-vapour lamps, which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting, and can help smooth the surface of other metals. Being a strong reducing agent, it {{is often used to}} reduce many other metals, such as titanium and zirconium, from their chlorides. Furthermore, it is very useful as a heat-exchange liquid in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point, viscosity, and cross-section towards <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption.</b>|$|E

40|$|Shielding {{neutrons}} involve {{three steps}} that are slowing <b>neutrons,</b> <b>absorption</b> of <b>neutrons,</b> and impregnation of gamma rays. Neutrons slow down with thermal energy by hydrogen, water, paraffin, plastic. Hydrogenated materials {{are also very}} effective for the <b>absorption</b> of <b>neutrons.</b> Gamma rays are produced by neutron (radiation) retention on the neutron shield, inelastic scattering, and degradation of activation products. If a source emits gamma rays at various energies, high-energy gamma rays sometimes specify shielding requirements. Multipurpose Materials for Neutron Shields; Concrete, especially with barium mixed in, can slow and absorb the neutrons, and shield the gamma rays.

5|$|The Sun is a Population I, or heavy-element-rich, star. The {{formation}} of the Sun may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae. This is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the Solar System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called Population II, heavy-element-poor, stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by transmutation through <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption</b> within a massive second-generation star.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactors}} {{were used}} to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption</b> cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Wu was {{contacted}} by the Manhattan District Engineer, Colonel Kenneth Nichols. The newly commissioned B Reactor at the Hanford Site had run into an unexpected problem, starting up and shutting down at regular intervals. John Archibald Wheeler suspected that a fission product, xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.4 hours, was the culprit, and might be a neutron poison. Segrè then remembered the work that Wu had done at Berkeley on the radioactive isotopes of xenon. The paper on the subject was still unpublished, but Wu and Nichols went to her dorm room, and collected the typewritten draft prepared for the Physical Review. Xenon-135 was indeed the culprit; {{it turned out to}} have an unexpectedly large <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption</b> cross-section.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{suggested}} for producing a new positron (e+) emitting isotope {{in a nuclear}} reactor with application to slow e+ beams. The initial radiated sample is 124 Xe which is transformed to 126 I by two <b>neutron</b> <b>absorptions</b> and an intermediate decay. Over 25 Ci of positrons with a specific activity of 25 Ci/gm can be produced by this technique, allowing the generation of a slow e+ beam of over 4 x 107 e+/cm 2 -s. As discussed in the conclusion, specific activities approaching 200 Ci/gm should be for activation cells are presented, one with Xe in the gas phase, the other with solid Xe.

50|$|The {{discovery}} and synthesis of new chemical elements by nuclear transmutation, and their {{production in the}} necessary quantities to allow the studying of their properties, {{was carried out in}} nuclear explosive device testing. For example, the discovery of the short lived einsteinium and fermium, both created under the intense neutron flux environment within thermonuclear explosions, followed the first Teller-Ulam thermonuclear device test - Ivy Mike. The rapid capture of so many neutrons required in the synthesis of einsteinium would provide the needed direct experimental confirmation of the so-called r-process, the multiple <b>neutron</b> <b>absorptions</b> needed to explain the cosmic nucleosynthesis (production) of all heavy chemical elements heavier than nickel on the periodic table, in supernova explosions, before beta decay, with the r-process explaining the existence of many stable elements in the universe.|$|R
50|$|Plutonium-242 has a {{particularly}} low cross section for thermal neutron capture; {{and it takes}} four <b>neutron</b> <b>absorptions</b> to become another fissile isotope (either curium-245 or plutonium-241) and undergo fission. Even then, {{there is a chance}} either of those two fissile isotopes will fail to fission but instead absorb the fourth neutron, becoming curium-246 (on the way to even heavier actinides like californium, which is a neutron emitter by spontaneous fission and difficult to handle) or becoming 242Pu again; so the mean number of neutrons absorbed before fission is even higher than 4. Therefore, Pu-242 is particularly unsuited to recycling in a thermal reactor and would be better used in a fast reactor where it can be fissioned directly. However, 242Pu's low cross section means that relatively little of it will be transmuted during one cycle in a thermal reactor.|$|R
5|$|In the universe, thorium {{is among}} the rarest of the {{primordial}} elements, because {{it is one of}} the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process, and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are uranium, also produced only by the r-process, and thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption,</b> reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|E
25|$|LiH, {{especially}} lithium-7 deuteride, {{is a good}} moderator {{for nuclear}} reactors, because deuterium has a lower <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption</b> cross-section than aneutronic hydrogen, decreasing <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption</b> in a reactor. Lithium-7 is preferred for a moderator {{because it has a}} lower neutron cross-section and also forms less tritium under neutron bombardment.|$|E
25|$|PWRs are {{designed}} to be maintained in an undermoderated state, meaning that there is room for increased water volume or density to further increase moderation, because if moderation were near saturation, then a reduction in density of the moderator/coolant could reduce <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption</b> significantly while reducing moderation only slightly, making the void coefficient positive. Also, light water is actually a somewhat stronger moderator of neutrons than heavy water, though heavy water's <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption</b> is much lower. Because of these two facts, light water reactors have a relatively small moderator volume and therefore have compact cores. One next generation design, the supercritical water reactor, is even less moderated. A less moderated neutron energy spectrum does worsen the capture/fission ratio for 235U and especially 239Pu, meaning that more fissile nuclei fail to fission on <b>neutron</b> <b>absorption</b> and instead capture the neutron to become a heavier nonfissile isotope, wasting one or more neutrons and increasing accumulation of heavy transuranic actinides, some of which have long half-lives.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMonte Carlo {{computer}} simulations confirmed that {{an increase in}} density has a minor effect on the weakening of neutron transport and, therefore, the optimum composition of a shielding concrete against gamma radiation is different than the one against neutron radiation. Neutron radiation shielding is a two-step process: slowing down of fast <b>neutrons</b> and <b>absorption</b> of thermal ones. Both result from the atomic composition of the barrier but their dependence on specified atomic compositions and moisture content is different. The aim of the presented research {{is to develop a}} high density concrete the composition of which would also assure good efficiency of neutron shielding. Neutron transport through standard cement mortar, PCC mortar, normal-weight concrete and magnetite heavy-weight concrete has been analyzed in the paper. The goal in research was to find an influence of the cement type, polymer addition, density and moisture content on the shielding properties against neutron. The research based on convergent results of MC {{computer simulations}} and real experiments confirmed the influence of the cement type on fast neutron attenuation. It was also found that each 1 % of moisture content makes 10 % increase of fast neutron thermalization effectiveness, what is a little less than it was estimated for cement based mortars. It was also proved that heavy-weight concrete is not proper solution for shielding against fast neutrons, but its efficiency is visible in the case of thermal <b>neutrons</b> <b>absorption,</b> probably due to increase of Fe content at the expense of Si and O in the atomic composition as well as water retained by magnetite aggregate...|$|R
40|$|The {{decomposition}} analysis of void reactivity coefficient for innovative BWR assemblies {{is presented in}} this paper. The innovative assemblies were loaded with high enrichment UO 2 and MOX fuels. Additionally {{the impact of the}} moderation enhancement on the void reactivity coefficient through a full fuel burnup discharge interval was investigated for the innovative assembly with MOX fuel. For the numerical analysis the TRITON functional module of SCALE code with ENDF/B-VI cross section library was applied. The obtained results indicate the influence of the most important isotopes to the void reactivity behaviour over a fuel burnup interval of 70 [*]GWd/t for both UO 2 and MOX fuels. From the neutronic safety concern positive void reactivity coefficient values are observed for MOX fuel {{at the beginning of the}} fuel irradiation cycle. For extra-moderated assembly designs, implementing 8 and 12 water holes, the neutron spectrum softening is achieved and consequently the lower void reactivity values.
