Computations were performed with the recursive centered T-matrix algorithm (RCTMA), a previously established method for solving the multiple scattering equation of light from finite clusters of isotropic dielectric objects.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} a general {{approach to the}} solution of the problem of nonisothermal Stokes flow relative to a heat-conducting particle having the shape of a slightly deformed sphere, taking account of Maxwell’s [J.

The results, which are of interest in connection with the phenomenon of thermophoresis, have potential applications in aerosol technology, and in the nonisothermal transport and processing of particulate matter. For the specific case of thermally nonconducting particles, the results obtained herein accord with Morrison’s [F. A. Morrison, J. Colloid Interface Sci., 34 (1970), pp. 210 – 214] proof in the comparable electrophoretic case that the phoretic velocity of a nonconducting, force- and torque-free, <b>nonspherical</b> <b>particle</b> undergoing electrophoresis in a fluid that is otherwise at rest is independent of the size, shape and orientation of the particle, and is identical to that of a sphere...|$|E

The shape of pores became complicated and pores tended to have fractal nature as the matrix content increased. It was proposed that the change of pore shape {{was caused by the}} increase in the amount of the matrix and its reaction with MgO grains. Both mean pore diameter and permeability showed a maximum at a matrix content, 10 wt% and 15 %, respectively. On the other hand, the fractal dimension of pore shape changed from 1. 39 at 5 wt% to 1. 65 at 20 wt% of matrix. The fractal dimension changed sharply between 10 - 15 wt%.

40|$|Higher-order {{terms of}} dielectrophoretic (DEP) force are {{commonly}} ignored by invoking the simplifying dipole approximation. Concurrently, the trend towards micro- and nano-electrode structures in DEP design is bringing about {{an increasing number}} of instances where the approximation is expected to lose reliability. The case is severe for <b>nonspherical</b> <b>particles</b> (the shape of many biological particles) due to the shape-dependent nature of dielectric polarization. However, {{there is a lack of}} analytical means to determine multipole moments of <b>nonspherical</b> <b>particles,</b> numerical calculations of the same are regarded as unreliable, and there is a prevalence for higher-order force considerations to be ignored. As a result, the dipole approximation is used and/or <b>nonspherical</b> <b>particles</b> are approximated as spheres. This work proves the inefficacy of current qualitative criteria for the reliability of the dipole approximation and presents a quantitative substitute, with verified accuracy, that enables precise determination of the extent to which the dipole approximation would be reliable, and if found unreliable, corrects the approximation by adding second- and third-order terms of the DEP force. The effects of field nonuniformity, electrode design, and particle shape and aspect ratio on the significance of higher-order DEP forces is quantitatively analyzed. The results show that higher-order DEP forces are indeed of substantially increased significance for nonspherical particles; in the cases examined in this work, multipolar terms are seen to constitute more than 40 % of the total force on ellipsoidal and cylindrical particles. It is further shown that approximating <b>nonspherical</b> <b>particles</b> as spheres of similar dimensions is subject to substantial error.

The depolarization lidar registered 13 dust events, {{most of which}} occurred in the spring (5 events) and winter (6 events). The dust layers occurred at heights of approximately 1. 4 – 3. 5 [*]km. The horizontal ranges of the dust plumes were approximately 750 – 2400 [*]km, based on the CALIPSO data.

The dust layers observed in the winter occurred at a lower height and had larger mean extinction and AOD, and smaller mean δ and δp than the spring dust layers. These wintertime features may result from a lower troposphere temperature inversion, the mixing of local aerosols, and hygroscopic growth under suitable relative humidity conditions.

The minimum detectable signal can be increased, for a given radar and ash plume scenario, by decreasing the observation range and increasing the operational frequency and also by exploiting possible polarimetric capabilities.

Here, we investigate the separation behaviors of nonspherical and spherical particles∕cells in the hydrodynamic filtration (HDF) scheme, which was previously developed for continuous size-dependent particle∕cell separation. <b>Nonspherical</b> <b>particle</b> models were prepared by coating the hemisphere of spherical polymer particles with a thin Au layer and by bonding the Janus particles to form twins and triplets resembling dividing and aggregating cells, respectively. High-speed imaging revealed {{a difference in the}} separation behaviors of spherical and nonspherical particles at a branch point; nonspherical particles showed rotation behavior and did not enter the branch channel even when their minor axis was smaller than the virtual width of the flow region entering the branch channel, w 1. The confocal-laser high-speed particle intensity velocimetry system visualized the flow profile inside the HDF microchannel, demonstrating that the steep flow-velocity distribution at the branch point is the main factor causing the rotation behavior of nonspherical particles.

To generate highly accurate force- and torque-balanced packings of circulo-lines and -polygons, we developed an interparticle potential that gives continuous forces and torques {{as a function of the}} particle coordinates. We show that the packing fraction and coordination number at jamming onset obey a master-like form for all of the <b>nonspherical</b> <b>particle</b> packings we studied when plotted versus the particle asphericity A, which is proportional to the ratio of the squared perimeter to the area of the particle. Further, the eigenvalue spectra of the dynamical matrix for packings of different particle shapes collapse when plotted at the same A. For hypostatic packings of nonspherical particles, we verify that the number of "quartic" modes along which the potential energy increases as the fourth power of the perturbation amplitude matches the number of missing contacts relative to the isostatic value. In addition, we calculate the principal curvatures of the inequality constraints for each contact in circulo-line packings and identify specific types of contacts with inequality constraints that possess convex curvature. These contacts can constrain multiple degrees of freedom and allow hypostatic packings of nonspherical particles to be mechanically stable. Comment: 17 pages, 22 figure...|$|E
