5|$|Emulating {{the style}} of Cirque du Soleil, Circus Juventas's first show was at Saint Paul's Highland Fest in 1995. From there, the school's {{enrollment}} quickly expanded and the organization initiated a campaign to fund a $2.1 million permanent big top facility, which opened in 2001 on Saint Paul parkland in the Highland Park <b>neighborhood.</b> <b>That</b> year, it began to produce annual summer performances showcasing the work of its most advanced students, each with a distinct theme.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, {{much of the}} {{southern}} part of the <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> had previously contained warehouses and empty lots has undergone development, including the River East Center east of Columbus Drive.

5|$|In 1999, {{the nonprofit}} {{organization}} Friends of the High Line {{was formed by}} Joshua David and Robert Hammond, residents of the <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> the line ran through. They advocated for the line's preservation and reuse as public open space, {{so that it would}} become an elevated park or greenway, similar to the Promenade Plantée in Paris. The organization was initially formed as a small community group to advocate for the High Line’s preservation and transformation {{at a time when the}} historic structure was under the threat of demolition during Rudy Giuliani’s second mayoral term.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1921 and spurred {{a new wave}} of {{development}} in South Jacksonville. New subdivisions were platted in Oklahoma and Villa Alexandria, including South Shores, Alexandria Place, River Oaks, and the original San Marco development, while the old Red Bank plantation became South Riverside and Colonial Manor. The 1857 the Red Bank Plantation House became a residence in the Colonial Manor <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> grew around it; it is Jacksonville's second oldest residential building still in use. The bridge triggered economic development in South Jacksonville as well, though it greatly reduced the ferry business, which disappeared entirely within twenty years.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{construction}} {{began on}} a 60-home upscale development called Arlington Heights, and {{a grant from}} the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development allowed for the demolition of Westlake Terrace, a sprawling and dilapidated public housing project. Today, the site features a blend of senior housing, rental townhouses and for-sale single-family homes. Low real-estate prices and the efforts of the Youngstown Central Area Improvement Corporation (CIC) have contributed to the purchase of several long-abandoned downtown buildings (many by out-of-town investors) and their restoration and conversion into specialty shops, restaurants, and eventually condominiums. Further, a nonprofit organization called Wick Neighbors is planning a $250 million New Urbanist revitalization of Smoky Hollow, a former ethnic <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> borders the downtown and university campus. The neighborhood will eventually comprise about 400 residential units, university student housing, retail space, and a central park. Construction for the project began in 2006.|$|E

Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.|$|E
5|$|The tower sits at 401 North Wabash Avenue in the River North Gallery District, {{part of the}} Near North Side {{community}} area of Chicago. The building {{occupies the}} site vacated by the Chicago Sun-Times, one of the city's two major newspapers, and its location within the River North Gallery District places it in a <b>neighborhood</b> <b>that</b> has had {{a high concentration of}} art galleries since the 1980s. The site, at the foot of Rush Street, is {{on the north side of}} the Chicago River just west of the Wrigley Building and the Michigan Avenue Bridge, and just east of Marina City and 330 North Wabash.

In each neighborhood he supervised the purchase and construction of homes and assisted home buyers in acquiring loans.
