6000|$|The guide {{showed us}} a colossal statue of Jupiter, in the Vatican, {{which he said}} looked so damaged and rusty--so like the God of the Vagabonds --because it had but {{recently}} been dug up in the Campagna. He asked how much we supposed this Jupiter was worth? I replied, with intelligent promptness, that he was probably worth about four dollars--may be four and a half. [...] "A hundred thousand dollars!" [...] Ferguson said. Ferguson said, further, that the Pope permits no ancient work of this kind to leave his dominions. He appoints a commission to examine discoveries like this and report upon the value; then the Pope pays the discoverer one-half of that assessed value and takes the statue. He said this Jupiter was dug from a field which had just been bought for thirty-six thousand dollars, so the first crop {{was a good one}} for the <b>new</b> <b>farmer.</b> I do not know whether Ferguson always tells the truth or not, but I suppose he does. I know that an exorbitant export duty is exacted upon all pictures painted by the old masters, in order to discourage the sale of those in the private collections. I am satisfied, also, that genuine old masters hardly exist at all, in America, because the cheapest and most insignificant of them are valued at the price of a fine farm. I proposed to buy a small trifle of a Raphael, myself, but the price of it was eighty thousand dollars, the export duty would have made it considerably over a hundred, and so I studied on it awhile and concluded not to take it.|$|E
6000|$|What {{has been}} done so far, and what more can be done? A bounty on corn has been introduced. I suppose nobody, {{certainly}} not its promoter, is enamoured of this. But {{it does not seem}} to have occurred to every one that you cannot eat nuts without breaking their shells, or get out of evil courses without a transition period of extreme annoyance to yourself. [...] "Bounty" [...] is, in many quarters, looked on as a piece of petting to an interest already pampered. Well--while we look on the land as an [...] "interest" [...] in competition with other [...] "interests" [...] and not as the vital interest of the country, underlying every other, so long shall we continue to be [...] "in the soup." [...] The land needs fostering, and again fostering, because the whole vicious tendency of the country's life has brought farming to its present pass and farmers to their attitude of mistrust. Doctrinaire objections are now ridiculous. An economic basis must be re-established, or we may as well cry [...] "Kamerad" [...] at once and hold up our hands to Fate. The greater the arable acreage in this country, the less will be the necessity for a bounty on corn. Unlike most stimulants, it is one which gradually stimulates away the need for it. With every year and every million acres broken up, not only will the need for bounty diminish, but the present mistrustful breed of farmer will be a step nearer to extinction. Shrewd, naturally conservative, and somewhat intolerant of anything so dreamy as a national point of view, they will not live for ever. The up-growing farmer will not be like them, and about the time the need for bounty is vanishing the <b>new</b> <b>farmer</b> will be in possession. But in the meantime land must be broken up until 8,000,000 acres at least are conquered; and bounty is the only lever. It will not be lever enough without constant urging. In Mr. Prothero's history of English farming occur these words: [...] "A Norfolk farmer migrated to Devonshire in 1780, where he drilled and hoed his roots; though his crops were far superior to those of other farmers in the district, yet at the close of the century no neighbour had followed his example." ...|$|E

Firstly, the <b>new</b> <b>farmers</b> have insight into villages, with strong motive of constructing new village, which make them become the qualified main body in new village construction, secondly, the <b>new</b> <b>farmers</b> are the most basic factor of constructing <b>new</b> village; <b>new</b> <b>farmers</b> have close relationship with other factors, with prominent inseparability; the <b>new</b> <b>farmers</b> have strong ability to replace other factors, and the farmers can shatter capital bottleneck and policy restriction {{in order to promote}} raid rural development to some extent; the <b>new</b> <b>farmers</b> with strong mobility, can migrate between city and village or change vocation among different jobs, which breaks through the regional limitation of factors; there are myriad farmers in China, and we can transform tradition <b>farmers</b> into <b>new</b> <b>farmers</b> by fostering, which breaks through the limitation of quantity of factors, so it can guarantee the incessant factor supply for new village construction. Thirdly, the <b>new</b> <b>farmers</b> are the internal motive force for new village construction, because the literate farmers are equipped with technique skills and good at management, and they are the excellent talents among rural groups; the <b>new</b> <b>farmers</b> fathom the characteristics of rural areas, with active consciousness, intense motive and strong ability to construct new village; they pay close attention to new village construction with passion and participate in new village construction actively.

I argue that the socialist peasants are in the transformation into neoliberal <b>new</b> <b>farmers.</b> I define the "new farmers" as a dispositive agricultural population that embodies neoliberal ideologies and practices.

6000|$|There is {{something}} mysterious in loch-fishing, in the tastes and {{habits of the}} fish which inhabit the innumerable lakes and tarns of Scotland. It {{is not always easy}} to account either for their presence or their absence, for their numbers or scarcity, their eagerness to take or their [...] "dourness." [...] For example, there is Loch Borlan, close to the well-known little inn of Alt-na-geal-gach in Sutherland. Unless that piece of water is greatly changed, it is simply full of fish of {{about a quarter of a}} pound, which will rise at almost any time to almost any fly. There is not much pleasure in catching such tiny and eager trout, but in the season complacent anglers capture and boast of their many dozens. On the other hand, a year or two ago, a beginner took a four-pound trout there with the fly. If such trout exist in Borlan, it is hard to explain the presence of the innumerable fry. One would expect the giants of the deep to keep down their population. Not far off is another small lake, Loch Awe, which has invisible advantages over Loch Borlan, yet there the trout are, or were, [...] "fat and fair of flesh," [...] like Tamlane in the ballad. Wherefore are the trout in Loch Tummell so big and strong, from one to five pounds, and so scarce, while those in Loch Awe are numerous and small? One occasionally sees examples of how quickly trout will increase in weight, and what curious habits they will adopt. In a county of south- western Scotland there is a large village, populated by a keenly devoted set of anglers, who miss no opportunity. Within a quarter of a mile of the village is a small tarn, very picturesquely situated among low hills, and provided with the very tiniest feeder and outflow. There is a sluice at the outflow, and, for some reason, the farmer used to let most of the water out, in the summer of every year. In winter the tarn is used by the curling club. It is not deep, has rather a marshy bottom, and many ducks, snipe, and wild-fowl generally dwell among the reeds and marish plants of its sides. Nobody ever dreamed of fishing here, but one day a rustic, [...] "glowering" [...] idly over the wall of the adjacent road, saw fish rising. He mentioned his discovery to an angler, who is said to have caught some large trout, but tradition varies about everything, except that the fish are very [...] "dour." [...] One evening in August, a warm, still evening, I happened to visit the tarn. As soon as the sun fell below the hills, it was literally alive with large trout rising. As far as one could estimate from the brief view of heads and shoulders, they were sometimes two or three pounds in weight. I got my rod, of course, as did a rural friend. Mine was a small cane rod, his a salmon-rod. I fished with one Test-fly; he with three large loch-flies. The fish were rising actually at our feet, but they seemed to move about very much, never, or seldom, rising twice exactly at the same place. The hypothesis was started that there were but few of them, and that they ran round and round, like a stage army, to give an appearance of multitude. But this appears improbable. What is certain was our utter inability ever to get a rise from the provoking creatures. The dry fly is difficult to use on a loch, as there is no stream to move it, and however gently you draw it it makes a [...] "wake"--a trail behind it. Wet or dry, or [...] "twixt wet and dry," [...] like the convivial person in the song, we could none of us raise them. I did catch a small but beautifully proportioned and pink-fleshed trout with the alder, but everything else, silver sedge and all, everything from midge to May-fly, in the late twilight, was offered to them in vain. In windy or cloudy weather it was just as useless; indeed, I never saw them rise, except in a warm summer stillness, at and after sunset. Probably they would have taken a small red worm, pitched into the ripple of a rise; but we did not try that. After a few evenings, they seemed to give up rising altogether. I don't feel certain that they had not been netted: yet no trout seemed to be on sale in the village. Their presence in the water may perhaps be accounted for thus: they may have come into the loch from the river, by way of the tiny feeder; but the river-trout are both scarce and small. A <b>new</b> <b>farmer</b> had given up letting the water off, and probably there must have been very rich feeding, water-shrimps or snails, which might partly account for the refusal to rise at the artificial fly. Or they may have been ottered by the villagers, though that would rather have made them rise short than not rise at all.|$|E
