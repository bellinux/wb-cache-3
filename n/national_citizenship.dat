5|$|For {{much of the}} country's history, {{voluntary}} acquisition {{or exercise}} of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of <b>national</b> <b>citizenship.</b> This concept was enshrined {{in a series of}} treaties between the United States and other countries (the Bancroft Treaties). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), as well as Vance v. Terrazas (1980), holding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred the Congress from revoking citizenship. However, Congress can revoke citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of the Dutch Republic, the seventeen provinces of the Netherlands had urban and not <b>national</b> <b>citizenship.</b> No inclusive citizenship status existed for the population of the Low Countries. Citizenship was a legal status available to all inhabitants of a particular city. There were certain obligation and privileges applied to all those that were burghers (citizens). These rights were never formally written down in legal documents, rather existed as a set of practices or city rights varying in every territory.|$|E

25|$|One cannot {{overestimate}} {{the importance of}} human rights discourse in shaping public opinion. What are the rights and obligations of human beings trapped in conflicts?

These rights can be equated with the rise of global citizenship as normative associations, indicating a <b>national</b> <b>citizenship</b> model that is more closed and a global citizenship one that is more flexible and inclusive. If true, this places a strain in the relationship between national and global citizenship.|$|E
25|$|The Commonwealth of Nations' {{heads of}} {{government}} decided in 1948 {{to embark on}} a major change in the law of nationality throughout the Commonwealth. It was decided at the conference that the United Kingdom and the self-governing dominions would each adopt separate <b>national</b> <b>citizenship,</b> but retain the common imperial status of British subject. The British Nationality Act, 1948 provided for a new status of Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC), consisting of British subjects who had a close relationship (either through birth or descent) with the United Kingdom and its remaining colonies. The Act also provided that British subjects could be known by the alternative title Commonwealth citizen.|$|E

Filipinos of mixed ethnic origins are still referred to today as mestizos. However, in common parlance, mestizos are only used to refer to Filipinos mixed with Spanish or any other European ancestry. Filipinos mixed with any other foreign ethnicities are named depending on the non-Filipino part.|$|E

25|$|The 1948 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting {{decided to}} make major changes in {{nationality}} laws throughout the Commonwealth, following Canada's decision to enact its Canadian citizenship law, effective January 1, 1947. Until then all Commonwealth countries, {{with the exception of}} the Irish Free State, had a single nationality status of British subject. It was decided at that conference that the United Kingdom and the self-governing dominions would each adopt a separate <b>national</b> <b>citizenship,</b> while retaining the common status of British subject. The Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948, which came into force on 26 January 1949, gave effect to that arrangement and created the concept of Australian nationality while continuing to be British subjects. However, the status of other (non-Australian) British subjects in Australia differed from the status of those who were not British subjects. Aborigines became Australian citizens under the 1948 Act in the same way as other Australians (though Aborigines were not counted in the Australian population until after a 1967 referendum). The same applied to Torres Strait Islanders and the indigenous population of the Territory of Papua (then a part of Australia).|$|E
25|$|The year 1795 {{marked the}} {{downfall}} of the Dutch Republic and gave birth to the Batavian Republic. At the beginning of the 19th century, the first codification of Dutch <b>national</b> <b>citizenship</b> appeared in the Napoleonic Code for the Kingdom of Holland effective from 1801–1811, originating from the French code of civil rights, the Code Civil. In 1813, after the proclamation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Code Civil continued to remain in effect even though a new Dutch constitution was drawn in 1815. The new constitution de facto became the first Dutch codification of Dutch citizenship, where it was stated that, starting from 1815, only residents had the freedom to occupy positions in public offices. This was a significant change from the citizenship laws of the preceding centuries. The Dutch civil code stipulated that residents were only those people who were born to parents officially residing on Dutch territory. Due to the colonial ambitions of the Netherlands, all those people who traveled abroad in official service of the country were considered to live in the Netherlands and were to be counted as residents. The new Dutch civil law was the building block for the implementation of jus sanguinis. On the other hand, even though descent remained very important for the acquisition of citizenship, the emphasis on the significance of residency, was evidence of the French influence of jus soli.|$|E

500|$|Senator James Rood Doolittle of Wisconsin {{asserted}} that all Native Americans {{were subject to}} United States jurisdiction, so that the phrase [...] "Indians not taxed" [...] would be preferable, but Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lyman Trumbull and Howard disputed this, arguing {{that the federal government}} did not have full jurisdiction over Native American tribes, which govern themselves and make treaties with the United States. In Elk v. Wilkins (1884), the clause's meaning was tested regarding whether birth in the United States automatically extended <b>national</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The Supreme Court held that Native Americans who voluntarily quit their tribes did not automatically gain <b>national</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The issue was resolved {{with the passage of the}} Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, which granted full U.S. citizenship to indigenous peoples.|$|E
500|$|The Privileges or Immunities Clause, {{which protects}} the {{privileges}} and immunities of <b>national</b> <b>citizenship</b> from interference by the states, was patterned after the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, which protects the {{privileges and immunities}} of state citizenship from interference by other states. In the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), the Supreme Court concluded that the Constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship—"national citizenship" [...] and [...] "state citizenship"—and the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits states from interfering only with privileges and immunities possessed by virtue of <b>national</b> <b>citizenship.</b> The Court concluded that the privileges and immunities of <b>national</b> <b>citizenship</b> included only those rights that [...] "owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws." [...] The Court recognized few such rights, including access to seaports and navigable waterways, the right to run for federal office, {{the protection of the}} federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the right to travel to the seat of government, the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the right to participate in the government's administration. This decision has not been overruled and has been specifically reaffirmed several times. Largely {{as a result of the}} narrowness of the Slaughter-House opinion, this clause subsequently lay dormant for well over a century.|$|E

500|$|The {{right of}} {{assembly}} was originally {{distinguished from the}} right to petition. In United States v. Cruikshank (1875), the Supreme Court held that [...] "the {{right of the people}} peaceably to assemble for the purpose of petitioning Congress for a redress of grievances, or for anything else connected with the powers or duties of the National Government, is an attribute of <b>national</b> <b>citizenship,</b> and, as such, under protection of, and guaranteed by, the United States. The very idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances." [...] Justice Morrison Waite's opinion for the Court carefully distinguished the right to peaceably assemble as a secondary right, while the right to petition was labeled to be a primary right. Later cases, however, paid less attention to these distinctions.|$|E
500|$|In 1917, Macmillan {{spoke out}} against the {{practice}} of assigning a woman's <b>national</b> <b>citizenship</b> depending on whom she married. From 1905, this had been the vocal position of Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair, known as Lady Aberdeen, but Macmillan saw the issue {{in a new light}} during the war. Women who were married to foreigners were, upon declaration of war, faced suddenly with status as enemy nationals within the land of their birth. From the same legal basis, a number of British women were enjoying full citizenship in enemy territories. Macmillan was in favour of women retaining their existing citizenship through marriage. To that end, she wrote a piece entitled [...] "The Nationality of Married Women" [...] that was published twice in Jus Suffragii, once in July 1917 and again with updated statistics in June 1918. However, no new laws were passed about it, and a woman's citizenship remained tied to that of her husband.|$|E

2500|$|Global {{citizenship}} {{consists of}} voluntary practices oriented to human rights, social justice, and environmentalism at the local, regional, and global level. Unlike <b>national</b> <b>citizenship,</b> global citizenship does not denote any legal status [...] or allegiance to an actual form of government. [...] The emergence of regional economic blocs, supra-national political {{institutions such as}} the European Union, and the advancement of ICTs, has caused governments to try to prepare national populations to be competitive in the global jobs market. This has led to the introduction of global citizenship education [...] programs at primary, secondary, and tertiary level, but also at independent NGOs, grass roots organizations, and other large scale educational organizations, such as the International Baccalaureate Organization and UNESCO.|$|E
2500|$|Global civics {{suggests}} that civics can be understood, {{in a global}} sense, as a social contract between global citizens {{in the age of}} interdependence and interaction.

World citizen has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional geopolitical divisions derived from <b>national</b> <b>citizenship.</b> An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in Socrates, whom Plutarch quoted as saying: [...] "I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world." [...] In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and nuclear proliferation.|$|E
