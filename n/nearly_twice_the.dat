However, the new sandwich was introduced while the company was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers, Hudson Foods, and had to deal with accusations that the introduction was designed to distract the public and media from the recall. The sandwich was initially introduced in the United States at a 99¢ (USD) price point, which helped propel sales to <b>nearly</b> <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> estimated volume and causing many locations to sell out of the burger patties used to produce the sandwich.|$|E

5|$|The {{previous}} {{members of}} group 8 have relatively high melting points (Fe, 1538°C; Ru, 2334°C; Os, 3033°C). Much like them, hassium {{is predicted to}} be a solid at room temperature, although the melting point of hassium has not been precisely calculated. Hassium should crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed structure (c/a=1.59), similarly to its lighter congener osmium. Pure metallic hassium is calculated to have a bulk modulus (resistance to uniform compression) {{comparable to that of}} diamond (442GPa). Hassium is expected to have a bulk density of 40.7g/cm3, the highest of any of the 118 known elements and <b>nearly</b> <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> density of osmium, the most dense measured element, at 22.61g/cm3. This results from hassium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough hassium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. Osmium is the densest element of the first 6 periods, and its heavier congener hassium {{is expected to be the}} densest element of the first 7 periods.|$|E
