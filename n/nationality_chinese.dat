40|$|In this study, {{we sought}} to clarify the effects of users' {{cultural}} background and cultural context on human-robot team collaboration by investigating attitudes toward {{and the extent to}} which people changed their decisions based on the recommendations of a robot collaborator. We report the results of a 2 × 2 experiment with <b>nationality</b> (<b>Chinese</b> vs. US) and communication style (implicit vs. explicit) as dimensions. The results confirm expectations that when robots behave in more culturally normative ways, subjects are more likely to heed their recommendations. Specifically, subjects with a Chinese vs. a US cultural background changed their decisions more when collaborating with robots that communicated implicitly vs. explicitly. We also found evidence that Chinese subjects were more negative in their attitude to robots and, as a result, relied less on the robot's advice. These findings suggest that cultural values affect responses to robots in collaborative situations and reinforce the importance of culturally sensitive design in HRI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Whereas {{the concept}} of {{usability}} is predominantly defined analytically, people relate to systems through personal usability constructs. Based on 48 repertory-grid interviews, this study investigates how such personal constructs are affected by two factors crucial to the international development and uptake of systems: <b>nationality</b> (<b>Chinese,</b> Danish, or Indian) and stakeholder group (developer or user). We find no significant overall difference across nationalities, but further analyses suggest that conventional usability aspects such as ease of use and simplicity are prominent for Chinese and Danish but not Indian participants and that a distinction between work and leisure-related communication is central to Chinese and Indian but not Danish participants. For stakeholder groups, we find a significant overall difference between developers and users. Unlike developers, users associate ease of use with leisure and, conversely, difficulty in use with workrelatedness. Further, users perceive usefulness as related to frustration and separate from ease of use, while developers construe usefulness, fun, {{and ease of use}} as related. In construing usability, participants make use o...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the quality of}} care for a hospital based-cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from East China according to the current practice guidelines. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted, involving 177 patients with IBD admitted to Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University between June 2000 and June 2006. Data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics as well as medical therapy including use of oral aminosalicylates, topical therapy, corticosteroid agents, immunomodulatory agents (such as azathioprine) at admission and outpatient clinic visit were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 177 eligible patients were evaluated in this study, including 71 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 106 with ulcerative colitis (UC). All were the Han <b>nationality</b> <b>Chinese</b> with active disease at baseline. All the 106 patients with ulcerative colitis received optimal doses of aminosalicylate while 27 of 68 (39. 7 %) patients with ileal or colonic CD received the suboptimal doses of aminosalicylate. The incidence of suboptimal dose of aminosalicylate was significantly higher in CD patients with small intestine involvement only (52. 8 % vs 25. 0 %, P = 0. 019). Thirty-one (54. 4 %) patients with active distal or left-sided ulcerative colitis received topical therapy, and 27. 8 % of patients suffering from severe inflammatory bowel disease did not receive oral or intravenous steroid therapy. Among the 51 patients for whom thiopurine was indicated, only 10 (19. 6 %) received immunomodulatory agents, {{and more than half of}} the 8 patients received a suboptimal dose of azathiopurine with no attempt to increase its dosage. CONCLUSION: The quality of care for IBD patients can be further improved. A suboptimal dose of aminosalicylate is used in treatment of patients with CD, especially in those with small intestine involved only. Topical mesalazine is inadequately used in patients with distal or left-sided colitis. Oral or intravenous steroid therapy is not used in some patients with severe IBD. Use of immunomodulatory medication is limited. Larger prospective studies are needed to {{investigate the}} quality of care for patients with IBD to establish our own evidence-based guidelines...|$|E
50|$|British {{citizens}} and BN(O)s who are of full or partial Chinese descent are also Chinese nationals under Chinese law {{unless they have}} renounced their <b>Chinese</b> <b>nationality</b> with the Hong Kong SAR Government. As China does not recognise multiple nationality, those persons are considered by China as solely Chinese nationals {{before and after the}} handover of Hong Kong and hence are not eligible for consular protection when on Chinese soil. Although holding the same <b>nationality</b> under the <b>Chinese</b> <b>nationality</b> law, <b>Chinese</b> nationals with a connection to Hong Kong or Macau have been categorised differently from Chinese nationals domiciled in Mainland China.|$|R
5000|$|In theory, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>Nationality</b> Law is de jure {{applicable}} to Chinese nationals residing {{in all three}} constituents of the People's Republic of China, namely Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, and Macau SAR. Due to the complex history of Hong Kong and Macau SARs, however, special [...] "explanations" [...] of the Nationality Law were made {{in place by the}} National People's Congress before the Handover of Hong Kong and Macau. These interpretations, applicable only to permanent residents of Hong Kong or Macau, have created a separate class of <b>Chinese</b> <b>nationality</b> unique to those two SARs, which differs vastly, especially with the acquisition and loss of <b>nationality,</b> from the <b>Chinese</b> <b>nationality</b> of Mainland <b>Chinese</b> residents with hukou.|$|R

50|$|The {{nationality}} law {{states that}} China {{does not recognize}} dual nationality with any other country (Article 3), although the clause can be interpreted differently based on the residency of a Chinese national. For residents of Mainland China with hukou, Article 3 and Article 9 have set forth the grounds for de jure loss of <b>Chinese</b> <b>nationality.</b> In reality, however, the actual loss of <b>Chinese</b> <b>nationality</b> for Mainland residents is difficult to enforce due to technical difficulties, such as lacking in record-sharing agreements with other countries. It is worth mentioning that unlike Indian <b>nationality</b> law, <b>Chinese</b> <b>nationality</b> law {{does not have any}} provisions restricting Chinese nationals from holding foreign passports.|$|R
50|$|Before the handover, some pro-democracy Hong Kong politicians, such as Margaret Ng, Emily Lau and Christine Loh {{attempted}} {{to use their}} British citizen passports to enter Mainland China because they were denied a Home Return Permit, hence denied from entering Mainland China.

Instead, the Visa Centers directed them to the Chinese consulate who then instructed them to apply for Chinese Travel Documents on the ground that they still have <b>Chinese</b> <b>nationality.</b> The <b>Chinese</b> consulate in Toronto clarified that the criteria of issuing Chinese visas to [...] "Hong Kong residents" [...] has not been changed.
