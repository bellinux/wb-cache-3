To protect them, the system of state preservation care has been established, the part of which are the Czech Ministry of culture, the Regional Councils' and Municipalities' with extended scope of authority Branches of Historical Sights Care and the <b>National</b> <b>Historical</b> Sights <b>Institute.</b> Nevertheless, the problem is that despite existing extensive system of state historical sights care there are cases of protection failure and progressive devastation and extinction of many cultural sights. The similar failures occur in Poland and Slovakia as well. The objective of this diploma thesis is to find out whether the present system of the sights care in the Czech Republic and comparable systems in the neighbouring countries - Poland and Slovakia secure the sufficient care of the cultural heritage, or if there are alternatives in organization of this area of the state administration. Subsequently, according to the available information it will be considered which of the systems of the state sights care seems to be the most suitable and effective for the defined role {{and at the same time}} the potential risks that can be caused by the particular systems will be identified. The following methods are used in my diploma thesis: Comparing - [...] ...|$|R
