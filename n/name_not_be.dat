5|$|Reich {{responded with}} a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein's mind. To rule out the {{influence}} of convection he told Einstein {{that he had taken}} certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the accumulator, wrapping it in a blanket, hanging it from the ceiling, burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that in all these circumstances the temperature difference remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air. Einstein did not respond to this or to Reich's future correspondence– Reich would write regularly reporting the results of his experiments– until Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and asked that his <b>name</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein's change of heart was part of a conspiracy of some kind, perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as The Einstein Affair.|$|E
