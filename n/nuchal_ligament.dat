5|$|Originally, Borsuk-Białynicka {{assumed that}} in {{standard}} position the neck was horizontal or slanted slightly downward. This {{was based on}} the reconstruction of the <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligament,</b> which runs atop of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae and serves to support the weight of the head and neck. Although an S-curved, swan-like ascending neck was envisaged in several subsequent reconstructions following similar depictions of better known sauropods, recent studies argue that sauropod necks were relatively straight and were carried more horizontally.|$|E
5|$|Later, diplodocids {{were often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to graze from tall trees. Studies using computer models have shown that neutral posture of the neck was horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level. A <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligament</b> may have held the neck in this position. A 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. One of the sauropod models in this study was Diplodocus, which they found would have held its neck at about a 45° angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} ligaments {{involved in the}} holding together of the vertebrae in the column, and in the column's movement.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Nuchal</b> <b>ligaments</b> from midwestern U. S. horses {{infected}} with adult Onchocerca sp. were studied. The prevalence of Onchocerca sp. infection in horses increased with age. Ten percent of horses {{less than one}} year old were infected, 28 % of horses one to five years old, 48 % of horses six to 15 years old, and 90 % of horses over 16 years old. Lesions in Onchocerca sp. -infected <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligaments</b> varied with age of the horse. Horses less than five years old had few or no lesions, whereas most horses six to 15 years old had focal mineralization and granuloma formation around adult worms. In infected <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligaments</b> of horses over 16 years old, mineralization was much greater and fewer normal parasites were found. Our data suggest that infection by viable parasites is terminated naturally. Equine onchocerciasis is a parasitic infection of horses, with world-wide distribu-tion, caused by a filiarial worm of the genus Onchocerca. The adults of Onchocerca cervicalis, Railliet and Henry 1910, are found in the ligamentous tissue adjacent to the nuchal attachment of the thoracic vertebral spinous processes and in and around the supraspinous bursa. With one exception, the prevalence of Onchocerca sp. infections in U. S. horses ha...|$|R

500|$|No {{complete}} set of vertebrae and ribs of Paraceratherium have yet been found and the tail is completely unknown. The atlas and axis vertebrae of the neck are wider than in most modern rhinoceroses, with space for strong ligaments and muscles that {{would be needed to}} hold up the large head. The rest of the vertebrae were also very wide, and had large zygapophyses with much room for muscles, tendons, ligaments, and nerves, to support the head, neck, and spine. The neural spines were long and formed a long [...] "hump" [...] along the back, where neck muscles and <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligaments</b> for holding up the skull were attached. The ribs were similar to those of modern rhinoceroses, but the ribcage would have looked smaller in proportion to the long legs and large bodies, because modern rhinoceroses are comparatively short-limbed. The last vertebra of the lower back was fused to the sacrum, a feature found in advanced rhinoceroses. Like sauropod dinosaurs, Paraceratherium had pleurocoel-like openings (hollow parts of the bone) in their pre-sacral vertebrae, which may have helped to lighten the skeleton.|$|R
25|$|The {{spine of}} a horse's back is {{supported}} by muscles, three ligaments, and abdominal muscles. The Spinalis Dorsi originates on the fourth cervical vertebra and inserts beneath the thoracic section of the Trapezius. The Longissimus dorsi originates from the last four cervical vertebrae, and courses along the spine, inserting eventually into the ilium and sacrum. This muscle contracts the spine and also raises and supports the head and neck, and is the main muscle used for rearing, kicking, jumping, and turning. It is the longest and strongest muscle in the body, and is the muscle the rider sits on. The Intercostal muscles begin at the spaces between the ribs and aid in breathing. The external and internal abdominal obliques {{are attached to the}} ribs and pelvic bones, and support the internal organs. The Supraspinous ligament begins at the poll and ends at the croup (sacral vertebrae). It supports the head and neck, and its traction force aids in supporting the weaker thoracic and lumbar areas. It spreads out and attaches to the spines of the cervical vertebrae. In the wither and neck area, it is called the <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligament.</b>|$|E
500|$|The giraffe has an {{extremely}} elongated neck, {{which can be}} up to [...] in length, accounting {{for much of the}} animal's vertical height. The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebrae, not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each cervical vertebra is over [...] long. They comprise 52–54 per cent of the length of the giraffe's vertebral column, compared with the 27–33 percent typical of similar large ungulates, including the giraffe’s closest living relative, the okapi. This elongation largely takes place after birth, perhaps because giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults. The giraffe's head and neck are held up by large muscles and a strengthened <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligament,</b> which are anchored by long dorsal spines on the anterior thoracic vertebrae, giving the animal a hump.|$|E
500|$|The {{skull and}} neck are not preserved, but the {{reconstruction}} of the <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligament</b> indicates the possession of a neck of medium length of roughly [...] As in other titanosaurs, the back was quite flexible {{due to the lack of}} accessory vertebral joints (hyposphene-hypantrum articulations), while the pelvic region was strengthened by an additional sixth hip vertebra. The anterior vertebrae of the tail were opisthocoelous, which means they were convex on their anterior sides and concave on their back sides, forming ball-and-socket joints. These opisthocoelous tail vertebrae lend Opisthocoelicaudia its name and serve to distinguish the genus from all other titanosaurs. Other titanosaurs were usually characterised by strongly procoelous anterior tail vertebrae, which were concave on their anterior sides and convex on their back sides. Another unique feature can be found in the back vertebrae, which show bifurcated spinous processes, resulting in a double row of bony projections along the top of the spine. While unique in titanosaurs, this feature can be found in several other unrelated sauropods, including Diplodocus and Euhelopus, where it evolved independently.|$|E
40|$|In the {{cervical}} region the fibres of the interspinous and <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligaments</b> pass in an anteroc ranial direction: {{they act}} against diminishing of the cervical lordosis. In the thoracic region, longitudinal bundles of fibres connect {{the tops of}} the spinous processes; they act against an augmentation of the thoracal kyphosis. Between thoracal kyphosis and lumbal lordosis there is no exact course of the fibres of the interspinous ligts. ("thorakolumbaler "Übergangsbereich"). In the lumbar spine the fibres of the interspinous ligts., being very strong, pass in a posterocranial direction. They have the function of limitation the range of flexion ventrally and of limiting backwards - shifting of the cranial vertebra in dorsal-flexion. In the lumbosacral segment additional fibres, arising {{from the top of the}} 5 th lumbar spinous process, pass in a posterocaudal direction and interlace with the thoracolumbar fascia, whose fibres form — below the 4 th lumbarvertebra — ascissor - latticed structure.

The occipital condyle was very wide and Paraceratherium appears to have had large, strong neck muscles, which allowed it to sweep its head strongly downwards while foraging from branches. One skull of P. transouralicum has a domed forehead, whereas others have flat foreheads, possibly because of sexual dimorphism. A brain endocast of P. transouralicum shows it was only 8 percent of the skull length, while the brain of the Indian rhinoceros is 17.7 percent of its skull length.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{highly unusual}} {{collagen}} was secreted by fibroblasts cultured from 150 - and 270 -d-old fetal calf <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligaments.</b> Purification revealed that this protein (which may be synthesized {{in a higher}} molecular weight form) was precipitated at unusually high concentrations of ammonium sulfate and was also eluted from DEAE-cellulose at greater salt concentrations than were types I and III procollagens. On SDS PAGE, the collagenous protein exhibited an M r of approximately 12, 750 that was not altered {{in the presence of}} reducing agent. The low molecular weight collagen (FCL- 1) was sensitive to bacterial collagenase and had a [3 H]glycine content comparable to that found in type I procollagen, although the [3 H]Hyp to [3 H]Pro ratio was 0. 43. FCL- 1 was not cleaved by human skin collagenase, mast cell protease, trypsin, Staphylococcal V 8 protease, or proteinase K at 37 °C. The collagen was susceptible to trypsin, but not to V 8 protease, only after heating at 80 *C for 30 min. Preliminary structural studies indicate that FCL- 1 was resistant to cleavage by CNBr but exhibited limited proteolysis with pepsin. Both 150 - and 270 -d-old fibroblasts produced comparable levels of interstitial (types I and III) procollagens, which comprised- 70 % of the total protein secreted into the culture medium.

40|$|Degenerative {{suspensory}} ligament desmitis (DSLD) is a chronic, debilitating disease occurring primarily in Peruvian Pasos and Peruvian Paso crosses. However, many other breeds are afflicted as well. DSLD {{is characterized by}} a slowly progressing bilateral or quadrilateral lameness. Typically, the owner does not recall any trauma or performance related injury. Fetlock effusion, static and dynamic hyperextension and degenerative joint disease are hallmarks on physical examination. Ultrasonography of affected ligaments reveals diffuse loss of echogenicity, and an irregular fiber pattern. Though until recently DSLD was considered a collagen disorder strictly limited to {{suspensory ligament}}s (SLs), our data show that it is a systemic disease involving tissues with high content of collagen. We have identified abnormal accumulations of proteoglycans not only in the SLs, but also in the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons, patellar and <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligaments,</b> aorta, coronary arteries and sclerae of DSLD-affected horses. Our most recent data point to the presence of an abnormal form of decorin in these proteoglycan deposits. This decorin also exhibited altered biological activity. Treatment for DSLD-affected horses is empirical and directed at minimizing musculoskeletal pain and providing support for the suspensory apparatus. Restricted exercise, supportive bandages and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provide some, but usually only temporary relief. Unfortunately, unrelenting pain, severe lameness and suffering require all too often humane euthanasia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Degenerative {{suspensory}} ligament desmitis (DSLD) is a debilitating disorder {{thought to be}} limited to {{suspensory ligament}}s of Peruvian Pasos, Peruvian Paso crosses, Arabians, American Saddlebreds, American Quarter Horses, Thoroughbreds, and some European breeds. It frequently leads to persistent, incurable lameness and need to euthanize affected horses. The pathogenesis remains unclear, though the disease appears to run in families. Treatment and prevention are empirical and supportive, and not effective in halting the progression of the disease. Presently, the presumptive diagnosis of DSLD is obtained from patient signalment and history, clinical examination, and ultrasonographic examination of clinically affected horses, and is confirmed at post mortem examination. Presently, there are no reliable methods of diagnosing DSLD in asymptomatic horses. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize and define the disorder in terms of tissue involvement at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Results We examined tissues and organs from 28 affected horses (22 Peruvian Pasos, 6 horses of other breeds) and from 8 control horses. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of excessive amounts of proteoglycans in the following tissues removed from DSLD-affected horses: suspensory ligaments, superficial and deep digital flexor tendons, patellar and <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligaments,</b> cardiovascular system, and sclerae. Electron microscopy demonstrated changes in diameters of collagen fibrils in the tendon, and in smooth muscle cells of the media of the aorta compatible with increased cell permeability in DSLD-affected cells. Separation of tendon extracts by gel chromatography revealed the presence of additional proteoglycan(s) in extracts from affected, but not control extracts. Conclusion This study demonstrates for the first time that DSLD, a disease process previously thought {{to be limited to}} the suspensory ligaments of the distal limbs of affected horses, is in fact a systemic disorder involving tissues and organs with significant connective tissue component. Abnormal accumulation of proteoglycans between collagen and elastic fibers rather than specific collagen fibril abnormalities is the most prominent histological feature of DSLD. Because of this observation and because of the involvement of many other tendons and ligaments beside the suspensory ligament, and of non-ligamentous tissue we, therefore, propose that equine systemic proteoglycan accumulation or ESPA rather than DSLD is a more appropriate name for this condition. </p...|$|R

50|$|Nuchal ligament: Because {{the head}} is {{decoupled}} from the shoulders, early Homo needed a way to stabilize the head. The <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligament</b> is an important evolved feature in head stabilization. It starts at the midline of the occiput and connects to the upper trapezius.

5000|$|Paraceratherium {{is one of}} {{the largest}} known land mammals that have ever existed, but its exact size is unclear because of the lack of {{complete}} specimens. Early estimates of 30 tonnes lb are now considered exaggerated; it may have been in the range of 15 to 20 tonnes lb at maximum, and as low as 11 tonnes lb on average. Calculations have mainly been based on fossils of P. transouralicum because this species is known from the most complete remains. Estimates have been based on skull, teeth, and limb bone measurements, but the known bone elements are represented by individuals of different sizes, so all skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations, resulting in several weight ranges. Its total body length was estimated as 8.7 m from front to back by Granger and Gregory in 1936, and 7.4 m by Vera Gromova in 1959, but the former estimate is now considered exaggerated. The weight of Paraceratherium was similar to that of some extinct proboscideans, with the largest complete skeleton known belonging to the steppe mammoth (Mammuthus trogontherii). In spite of the roughly equivalent mass, Paraceratherium may have been taller than any proboscidean. Its shoulder height was estimated as 5.25 m at the shoulders by Granger and Gregory, but 4.8 m by Gregory S. Paul in 1997. The neck was estimated at 2 to 2.5 m long by Michael P. Taylor and Mathew J. Wedel in 2013. The teeth of P. orgosensis (from which that species is mainly known) are 25 percent larger than those of P. transouralicum, making it the largest known indricothere.No complete set of vertebrae and ribs of Paraceratherium have yet been found and the tail is completely unknown. The atlas and axis vertebrae of the neck are wider than in most modern rhinoceroses, with space for strong ligaments and muscles that would be needed to hold up the large head. The rest of the vertebrae were also very wide, and had large zygapophyses with much room for muscles, tendons, ligaments, and nerves, to support the head, neck, and spine. The neural spines were long and formed a long [...] "hump" [...] along the back, where neck muscles and <b>nuchal</b> <b>ligaments</b> for holding up the skull were attached. The ribs were similar to those of modern rhinoceroses, but the ribcage would have looked smaller in proportion to the long legs and large bodies, because modern rhinoceroses are comparatively short-limbed. The last vertebra of the lower back was fused to the sacrum, a feature found in advanced rhinoceroses. Like sauropod dinosaurs, Paraceratherium had pleurocoel-like openings (hollow parts of the bone) in their pre-sacral vertebrae, which may have helped to lighten the skeleton.The limbs were large and robust to support the animal's large weight, and were in some ways similar to and convergent with those of elephants and sauropod dinosaurs with their likewise graviportal (heavy and slow moving) builds. Unlike such animals, which tend to lengthen the upper limb bones while shortening, fusing and compressing the lower limb, hand, and foot bones, Paraceratherium had short upper limb bones and long hand and foot bonesexcept for the disc-shaped phalangessimilar to the running rhinoceroses from which they descended. Some foot bones were almost 50 cm long. The thigh bones typically measured 1.5 m, a size only exceeded by those of some elephants and dinosaurs. The thigh bones were pillar-like and much thicker and more robust than those of other rhinoceroses, and the three trochanters on the sides were much reduced, as this robustness diminished their importance. The limbs were held in a column-like posture instead of bent, as in smaller animals, which reduced the need for large limb muscles. The front limbs had three toes.Due to the fragmentary nature of known Paraceratherium fossils, the animal has been reconstructed in several different ways since its discovery. In 1923, W. D. Matthew supervised an artist to draw a reconstruction of the skeleton based on the even less complete P. transouralicum specimens known by then, using the proportions of a modern rhinoceros as a guide. The result was too squat and compact, and Osborn had a more slender version drawn later the same year. Some later life restorations have made the animal too slender, with little regard to the underlying skeleton. Gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959, based on the P. transouralicum skeleton from the Aral Formation, but this also lacked several neck vertebrae.|$|R
