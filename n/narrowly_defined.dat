5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more <b>narrowly</b> <b>defined</b> Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more <b>narrowly</b> <b>defined</b> Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|E
5|$|Disagreement {{exists as}} to whether Attalea should be {{considered}} a single genus, or a group of related genera. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas, Andrew Henderson, Gloria Galeano and Rodrigo Bernal combined all the species in the subtribe Attaleinae (as it was then defined) into a single genus, Attalea. In his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe Attaleinae, American botanist Sidney F. Glassman divided the group into five genera—a more <b>narrowly</b> <b>defined</b> Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana, Scheelea and Ynesa. Rafäel Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms, and Jean-Christophe Pintaud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Since {{these first}} {{landmark}} GWA studies, {{there have been}} two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller odds ratios and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more <b>narrowly</b> <b>defined</b> phenotypes, such as blood lipids, proinsulin or similar biomarkers. These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into biomarkers. A variation of GWAS uses participants that are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of study has been named genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX).|$|E

These areas are in Rimutaka Forest Park near Wellington, and Saint Arnaud in the {{northern}} part of the South Island. These locations are relatively far away from each other and isolated, which, together with its absence in the rest of New Zealand, makes it unlikely that the species is a recent import. It is more likely that the species is native to New Zealand and has been overlooked in earlier surveys due to its rarity.|$|E
5|$|Savage {{performed}} his Army tasks but {{was unhappy}} with the <b>narrowly</b> <b>defined</b> role. He tendered his resignation on December 31, 1870. Through President Grant, he went to Marseilles and Rome as an American vice-consul. In 1871, Savage traveled to Egypt to act with the rank of captain for one year as secretary to Charles Pomeroy Stone, a former American general in the Egyptian Army, serving under Khedive Isma'il Pasha. Following an honorable discharge from the Egyptian Army, Savage returned to the U.S. and was tasked by Grant to serve as one of three commissioners investigating a series of border incidents between the U.S. and Mexico 1872–74. At the same time, he worked with Richard King and the nascent Corpus Christi & Rio Grande Railroad as chief surveyor for the route to Laredo.|$|E

5000|$|Composting {{of waste}} is an aerobic (in the {{presence}} of air) method of decomposing solid wastes. The process involves decomposition of organic waste into humus known as compost {{which is a good}} fertilizer for plants. However, the term [...] "composting" [...] is used worldwide with differing meanings. Some composting textbooks <b>narrowly</b> <b>define</b> composting as being an aerobic form of decomposition, primarily by aerobic or facultative microbes. [...] An alternative form of organic decomposition to composting is [...] "anaerobic digestion".|$|R
5000|$|The {{continental}} shelf of Russia (also called the Russian {{continental shelf}} or the Arctic {{shelf in the}} Arctic region) is a continental shelf adjacent to Russia. Geologically, {{the extent of the}} shelf is defined as the entirety of the continental shelves adjacent to Russia's coast. In international law, however, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea more <b>narrowly</b> <b>defines</b> the extent of the shelf as the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas over which a state exercises sovereign rights.|$|R

The presentation will alternate between the Machame as a confederation of Chagga states West of river Weruweru (by the 1860s), Machame as <b>narrowly</b> <b>defining</b> the Machame-Masama state by the end of the 1880s, and Machame as a location that bears that name (i.e. pre-1800 identity).|$|R

If an employee invokes the Garrity rule (sometimes called the Garrity Warning or Garrity Rights) before answering the questions, then the answers cannot be used in criminal prosecution of the employee. This principle was developed in Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967). The rule is most commonly applied to public employees such as police officers.|$|E
25|$|Scholarly {{peer review}} (also known as refereeing) {{is the process}} of {{subjecting}} an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal or as a book. The peer review helps the publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief or the editorial board) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. Peer review requires a community of experts in a given (and often <b>narrowly</b> <b>defined)</b> field, who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less <b>narrowly</b> <b>defined</b> or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish, and the significance (good or bad) of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scientific journals, but it does by no means prevent publication of all invalid research. Traditionally, peer reviewers have been anonymous, but there is currently a significant amount of open peer review, where the comments are visible to readers, generally with the identities of the peer reviewers disclosed as well.|$|E

Most of this early work on hand grips had a pragmatic basis as it was intended to <b>narrowly</b> <b>define</b> compensable injuries to the hand, which required an understanding of the anatomical basis of hand movement. Napier proposed two primary prehensile grips: the precision grip and the power grip. The precision and power grip are defined by the position of the thumb and fingers where: ...|$|R

He fears the administration's policy will put American prisoners at risk of torture, summary executions and other atrocities by chipping away at Geneva Conventions. He argues that his rival bill to Bush’s plan gives defendants access to classified evidence being used to convict them and will set tight limits on use of testimony obtained by coercion. Furthermore it offers CIA interrogators some legal protections from charges of abuse, but rejects the administration’s plan to more <b>narrowly</b> <b>define</b> the Geneva Conventions’ standards for humane treatment of prisoners.

25|$|Jim Voytilla of the Ramsey County, Minnesota, Human Services Department created EA {{groups for}} intellectually {{disabled}} substance abusers in 1979. Voytilla noted when this particular demographic of substance abusers attended AA {{meetings in the}} surrounding community, they felt uncomfortable and made others attending the meetings uncomfortable. Voytilla's EA meetings were created to avoid these problems, and address the illnesses of his clients other than substance abuse. Since then, four articles have <b>narrowly</b> <b>defined</b> EA as a program specifically for mentally retarded or intellectually disabled substance abusers. In a similar way, EA has also been incorrectly described as an organization either specifically or primarily {{for those who have}} been discharged from psychiatric hospitals.|$|E
25|$|If {{ripening}} is {{broadly defined}} as the development of wine grapes, then {{it could be said}} that ripening is happening throughout the continuous annual cycle of the grapevine. More <b>narrowly</b> <b>defined,</b> ripening begins at the inception of veraison. At this point (which is normally 40–60 days after fruit set though it may be longer in cooler climates), the grapes are hard and green with low sugar levels and very high levels of mostly malic acids. During veraison, which may last from 30–70 days depending on the climate and other factors, the grapes go through several changes which impact their sugar, acid, tannin and mineral composition. The concentration of phenolic compounds in the skin, most notably anthocyanins for red wine grapes, replace the green color of chlorophyll as the grape berries themselves change color.|$|E
5000|$|A {{problem that}} may result from <b>narrowly</b> <b>defining</b> the {{knowledge}} stocks to be measured is that of reification and institutionalisation of such stock. Identifying a set of importance may over-emphasise the real strategic value of the set, especially in times of strategical change. When knowledge stocks are identified and attention given to them their importance may be rectified by those within the firm and results {{in the development of}} core rigidities, or strategic commitment, which may stagnate potentially revitalising innovation. Leonard-Barton identified knowledge {{as one of the most}} difficult to change. When it is past success and attention, it creates core rigidities.

It was in the 19th century that the terms [...] "Buddhism", [...] "Hinduism", [...] "Taoism", and [...] "Confucianism" [...] first emerged. In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (scientia) and religion (religio) were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.|$|R
25|$|O'Connor did, however, {{state that}} the Court accepts certain forms of {{categorical}} presumptions of confidentiality. But these categorical presumptions {{are a lot more}} <b>narrowly</b> <b>defined</b> than what the FBI had previously used. Justice O'Connor gave the scenario of a paid informant as an example of an accepted categorical presumption of confidentiality. She stated that a paid informant can expect that his/her cooperation with the FBI will be kept secret, and that this makes documents related to a paid informant subject to being withheld or redacted in accordance with Exemption 7(D). She also stated that, in murder cases like this one, informants may also expect to have their interactions with the FBI be confidential. Justice O'Connor said that the Court would accept the FBI's presumption of the confidentiality of any documents related to an informant for a murder case.|$|E
25|$|Earthquake {{engineering}} is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with earthquakes in mind. Its overall {{goal is to}} make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake {{engineering is}} the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been <b>narrowly</b> <b>defined</b> as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance.|$|E

Given the minor role of the market in the household economy, should we expect the farmer to behave as a merchant would? Rather than <b>narrowly</b> <b>defining</b> farmers as either market, or subsistence oriented, we should see where they fall on the scale between the two, and ask what social dynamics emerge from the often contradictory demands which result.

The most recent paradigm to gain wide acceptance {{in the field is}} often referred to as the zigzag model, which reconciles the previously formulated gene-for-gene hypothesis with the recognition of general elicitors in a single model. This review focuses on the limitations of the current paradigm of molecular plant-microbe interactions and how it too <b>narrowly</b> <b>defines</b> the plant immune system. As such, we discuss an alternative view of plant innate immunity as a system that evolves to detect invasion. This view accommodates the range from mutualistic to parasitic symbioses that plants form with diverse organisms, as well as the spectrum of ligands that the plant immune system perceives. Finally, how this view can contribute to the current practice of resistance breeding is discussed...|$|R
