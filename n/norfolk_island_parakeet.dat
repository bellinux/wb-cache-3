50|$|Norfolk Island National Park is a {{protected}} area of 6.50 km2 established in 1984 and {{managed by the}} Commonwealth of Australia. It comprises two sections, the Mount Pitt section on Norfolk Island in the South Pacific Ocean with an area of 4.60 km2 and the neighbouring 1.90 km2 Phillip Island, {{as well as the}} much smaller Nepean Island. The Norfolk Island group is an Australian territory and the park is managed by Parks Australia. It is {{the only place in the}} world where the <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>parakeet</b> and the white-chested white-eye occur.|$|E
50|$|R. baueri reaches 10 m {{or more in}} height. The pinnate {{leaves are}} 3 to 4 m long, on a stout, erect petiole (leafstem) {{approximately}} 20 cm long. The crownshaft is 50-60 cm long. The inflorescence is 30 50 cm long and has from 50 to 60 fairly stout branches. The fruits are green at first, turning a bright red when ripe, and are a favorite food of the endangered <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>parakeet.</b> The growing tip of the palm was used by early settlers as a vegetable and {{is said to have}} tasted like a nut when raw and like an artichoke bottom when boiled.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1910, a {{small number}} of crimson rosellas were {{released}} off the Otago heads, New Zealand, along with eastern rosellas. These interbred and by the 1950s no pure crimson rosellas remained. This mixed population has remained there ever since. Crimson rosellas were also present in Wellington City from 1963 through the early 1990s as an introduced species. Two crimson rosellas were also recorded from the Tararua foothills in 1971. It is now thought to be extinct in the wild in New Zealand. They have also been introduced to Norfolk Island, where they are often known as [...] "red parrots", to distinguish them from the native <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> <b>parakeet</b> or [...] "green parrots".|$|E
50|$|The Norfolk parakeet (Cyanoramphus cookii), {{also called}} Tasman <b>parakeet,</b> <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> green parrot or <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> red-crowned <b>parakeet,</b> is {{a species of}} parrot in the family Psittaculidae. It is endemic to <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island</b> (located between Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia in the Tasman Sea). The species was once {{considered}} a subspecies of the red-fronted parakeet of New Zealand. The name Tasman parakeet is used by Christidis and Boles on the argument that this species and the Lord Howe red-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae subflavescens) are probably a single species for which they use biogeographical arguments. Tasman is used for other species with the same distribution and they propose that name for that reason. However, the latter subspecies {{was not included in}} the genus-wide phylogenetic reconstruction using DNA sequences, and the lumping of the species should be considered tentative.|$|R
5000|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{analysis}} {{has indicated that}} the orange-fronted parakeet is a separate species {{and not just a}} colour variation of the yellow-crowned parakeet. The orange-fronted parakeet is highly endangered, with less than 200 individuals remaining in the North Canterbury region of the South Island. Furthermore, Chatham <b>Island's</b> yellow-crowned <b>parakeet</b> and the red-crowned populations of New Caledonia, <b>Norfolk</b> <b>Island,</b> and the subantarctic islands have been determined to be distinct species.|$|R
