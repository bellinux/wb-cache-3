50|$|UV inks do not blend during application, {{as normal}} inks do. Additionally their {{consistency}} is thinner.

40|$|AIM: To {{conduct a}} {{preliminary}} {{study on the}} effect of flexible spectral imaging color enhancement (FICE) used in combination with ultraslim endoscopy by focusing on the enhanced contrast between tumor and non-tumor lesions. METHODS: We examined 50 lesions of 40 patients with epithelial tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract before endoscopic submucosal dissection using ultraslim endoscopy with conventional natural color imaging and with FICE imaging. We retrospectively investigated the effect of the use of FICE on endoscopic diagnosis in comparison with <b>normal</b> <b>light.</b> RESULTS: Visibility of the epithelial tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract with FICE was superior to <b>normal</b> <b>light</b> in 54 % of the observations and comparable to <b>normal</b> <b>light</b> in 46 % of the observations. There was no lesion for which visibility with FICE was inferior to that with <b>normal</b> <b>light.</b> FICE visualized 69. 6 % of hyperemic lesions and 58. 8 % of discolored lesions better than conventional endoscopy with natural color imaging. FICE significantly improved the visibility of lesions with hyperemia or discoloration compared with normocolored lesions. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the use of FICE would improve the ability of ultraslim endoscopy to detect epithelial tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract...|$|R

50|$|Fluorescent dyes are dyes which fluoresce under {{ultraviolet}} light or other unusual lighting.

50|$|Crackle tubes appear white {{when viewed}} in their off state under <b>normal</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions. Their luminosity, or light intensity, depends on several factors, but {{generally}} crackle tubes {{are not very}} bright when compared to a fluorescent light or incandescent lamp. Still, they are quite bright compared to similar devices. However, they are best viewed in darkness. Their transformers can also be linked to an acoustic modulator, allowing the tubes to 'respond' to music or ambient noise.|$|E

40|$|Heterocyst {{differentiation}} in the cyanobacterium Anabaena cylindrica is {{initiated by}} the removal of fixed nitrogen from the medium. These specialized cells occur singly at regular intervals within filaments of vegetative cells. Incubation of cultures for periods of up to 12 h immediately prior to or following removal of fixed nitrogen, at a light intensity (500 /iEinsteins cm~ 2 s" 1) approximately 10 -fold higher than that required for optimum growth, resulted in the differentiation of pairs of adjacent (double) heterocysts. The frequency of double heterocysts was proportional {{to the length of}} the period of high light intensity. During growth at <b>normal</b> <b>light</b> intensity approximately 5 % of cell divisions were symmetrical, but this increased more than 3 -fold during 10 -h incubation at high light intensity. The frequency of dividing cells remained constant during this period, but increased rapidly on return to <b>normal</b> <b>light.</b> The frequency of double heterocysts was reduced if a period of incubation at <b>normal</b> <b>light</b> intensity was interposed between the 12 -h period at high light intensity and transfer to nitrogen-free medium. A period of 8 h <b>normal</b> <b>light</b> was required to reduce the frequency of double heterocysts to control values, and this corresponded to the length of time needed for the frequency of symmetrical divisions to return to control levels following 12 h at high light intensity.

40|$|The {{unicellular}} green alga Dunaliella bardawil exhibits typical {{responses to}} excessive light when starved for sulfate under <b>normal</b> <b>light</b> (60 [mu]E m- 2 s- 1) but not under low light (14 [mu]E m- 2 s- 1). Algae were analyzed during {{several days of}} sulfate starvation for nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence in the absence or presence of the uncouplers SF- 6847 (SF) or carbonyl cyanide p- trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone. Parallel analyses followed two light-stress responses: (a) violaxanthin conversion to zeaxanthin and (b) accumulation of Cbr, a protein analogous to plant early-light-induced proteins and implicated in zeaxanthin binding. In cells starved under <b>normal</b> <b>light</b> SF inhibited nonphotochemical quenching during the first 24 h, but not from 40 h onward. In cells starved under low light SF inhibited nonphotochemical quenching throughout the starvation period. Under <b>normal</b> <b>light</b> accumulation of zeaxanthin was nearly maximal by 24 h, but Cbr was fully induced only by 40 h. Under low light zeaxanthin accumulated slowly but no Cbr was evident. These results suggest that during exposure to excessive light, the initial pH gradient-dependent, Cbr-independent mode of nonphotochemical quenching is modified to become less dependent on pH gradient and requires Cbr...|$|R
50|$|As a {{color of}} low intensity, brown is a {{tertiary}} color: {{a mix of}} the three subtractive primary colors is brown if the cyan content is low. Brown exists as a color perception only {{in the presence of}} a brighter color contrast. Yellow, orange, red, or rose objects are still perceived as such if the general illumination level is low, despite reflecting the same amount of red or orange light as a brown object would in <b>normal</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{transportation}} of all-trans-retinal back to RPE cells is not 100% efficient, {{and a small}} amount of all-trans-retinal can escape. This condenses with membrane-bound ethanolamine to form a Schiff's base. A second molecule of all-trans-retinal reacts with the Schiff's base and forms A2E. The formation of A2E is largely associated with the rod photoreceptor cells. These cells account for approximately 95% of human photoreceptors, and turn over cis to trans retinol constantly under <b>normal</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{stems of}} Dendrobium officinale Kimura et Migo, named Tie-pi-shi-hu, {{is one of}} the most {{endangered}} and precious species in China. Because of its various pharmacodynamic effects, D. officinale is widely recognized as a high-quality health food in China and other countries in south and south-east Asia. With the rising interest of D. officinale, its products have a high price due to a limited supply. This high price has led to the proliferation of adulterants in the market. To ensure the safe use of D. officinale, a fast and convenient method combining normal and fluorescence microscopy was applied in the present study to distinguish D. officinale from three commonly used adulterants including Zi-pi-shi-hu (D. devonianum), Shui-cao-shi-hu (D. aphyllum), Guang-jie-shi-hu (D. gratiosissimum). The result demonstrated that D. officinale could be identified by the characteristic “two hat-shaped” vascular bundle sheath observed under the fluorescence microscopy and the distribution of raphides under <b>normal</b> <b>light</b> microscopy. The other three adulterants could be discriminated by the vascular bundle differences and the distribution of raphides under <b>normal</b> <b>light</b> microscopy. This work indicated that combination of <b>normal</b> <b>light</b> and fluorescence microscopy is a fast and efficient technique to scientifically distinguish D. officinale from the commonly confused species...|$|R
