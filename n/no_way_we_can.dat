2500|$|Although Team USA {{would win}} all eight {{games in the}} 1996 Olympics, with the closest game being a 15-point victory over Japan, VanDerveer was not certain of victory, even as the team was {{en route to a}} 52–0 pre-Olympic record against college and {{national}} teams. After beating the Cuban national team on May 26, 1996, in Townsville, Australia, the team record reached 44–0. In their next game against the Ukraine national team, played in Adelaide on May 14, the USA team won again, but VanDerveer was not happy. Ukraine, at full strength, was not {{the best team in the}} world, and was not seen to be as strong as Russia or Brazil. Moreover, Ukraine was expected to add better players before the Olympics, yet the USA team won by only 11 points, 62–51. VanDerveer recalled worrying at the time: [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> play like this and win a gold medal." ...|$|E

The game made its first public appearance at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, starting on June 10, 2014, where four new characters were revealed, apart from the two already revealed by the trailer. With over eleven million views, it was the third-highest viewed trailer on YouTube {{in the second quarter}} of 2014. NetherRealm Studios said they are only working on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game. The game, which runs at 1080p screen resolution and 60FPS, has been said to feature the most brutal finishing moves in the series.

2500|$|Cruyff's footballing {{principles}} {{have significantly}} influenced the football career of many players and managers, including Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, two devoted disciples and successors of the Cruyffian (Barça-Ajax) school of football. Without Cruyff operating {{behind the scenes}} as the spiritual father of Barça, {{there could be no}} Joan Laporta presidency, and Rijkaard and Guardiola, two largely unproven managers, could never have been appointed. Guardiola, a typical product (graduate) of Cruyffian school, who was the manager of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, stated: [...] "Throughout my career I've simply tried to instil what I learned from Johan Cruyff. He has had the biggest influence on football out of anyone in the world, first as a player and then as a coach. He taught me a lot {{and you can see that}} in the fact that so many of his former players are now coaches". Guardiola added, [...] "Johan Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] In regards to how the football world will remember Cruyff's posthumous legacy, he said, [...] "As a player and as a manager he won a lot of titles, but that's not his legacy. The titles only help. Johan has changed two clubs. Not only did he change Ajax, but also Barcelona – and then the Dutch and Spanish national teams, too. Forget the titles. I've won more titles than him. Messi, for example, is someone runs less and in that he's the best of Cruyff's alumni. (...) I would not have been capable of doing what he did at Barcelona. He changed everything. He did it all. What Cruyff's done for football cannot be compared. The statue thing is superficial. He has made us love this sport so openly that there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> forget him." [...] Jürgen Klinsmann, the head coach of the United States national team, said about Cruyff's overall impact on contemporary football, [...] "More than an athlete, Cruyff was also a great thinker, someone who reinvented the sport... Cruyff has left us now, but his vision and philosophy will hopefully live forever. You can see it in the way Barcelona—one of two clubs Cruyff revolutionized, along with Ajax—still plays every week. It's a style that has admirers around the world. I think a lot of people share that [...] with him. You want to see this type of game, where you set the tone, you control the game, you make it fast, you make it attractive and attacking. He's always been famous for his version of the 4–3–3 with the wide wingers, all technically highly gifted and fast. This is his mark." ...|$|E

And go now the whole of you,' she said, 'and see can you bring her away from the poet's talk.' But Oona would not listen to any of them, but only moved her hand as if to send them away.

40|$|Abstract: Contrary {{from what}} seems to be the {{received}} wisdom in political theory, there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> affect future people, at least not people who live several generations later than we do and who are not taken care of by our standard concern for our close descendants. This is good news for the all affected principle. The fact that we cannot involve future people in our present decision-making does not mean, then, that we have to depart from the requirements of the all affected principle. And this principle is natural to adopt if we conceive of democracy as a way of aggregating interests. So the principle remains a live option in that sphere of democratic theory. However, its role is limited by the fact that we have to make moral decisions about the future. Here an epistemic notion of democracy is more to the point than the idea of a method of aggregating interests...|$|R

We are then left with the questions of whether or not a treatment works and, if so, how well...|$|R

5000|$|SALVATION - The Bible says, [...] "all have sinned {{and fall}} short of the glory of God" [...] (Romans 3:23). Also, the Bible says, [...] "the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" [...] (Romans 6:23). Sin {{separates}} us from God, and there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{get rid of all}} the sin in our life. There is nothing that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do in order to overcome this terrible plight. Fortunately, God loves us, and He sent Jesus into the world in order to solve our sin problem for us. Because of His love for us, Jesus died on a cross, as a perfect sacrifice for our sins. The Bible tells how Jesus took our sins upon Himself; He took the punishment for our sins. Therefore, salvation (forgiveness of sin and a personal relationship with God) is a gift provided for everyone by God. However, we must receive that gift by placing our faith in Christ and surrendering to Jesus as Lord. Salvation is purely a gift of God's grace which we receive by faith. Then, we are reconciled with God and will live in heaven with Jesus for all eternity. Also, He will live with us in this life through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.|$|R
