After Fortune suggested that her own organisation could serve as a feeder group to Mathers's Alpha et Omega, Mathers expelled her from the order, claiming that this was <b>necessitated</b> <b>by</b> Fortune having the wrong signs in her aura.

5|$|The McLaughlin Planetarium {{was closed}} on November 5, 1995. The {{president}} of the ROM stated that {{the closure of the}} planetarium was due to a combination of falling attendance and a declining interest in space, and that the closure was <b>necessitated</b> <b>by</b> provincial budget cuts. The decision came as a surprise to many, as attendance had rebounded in recent years, and the planetarium was one of few in North America at the time that was turning a profit. The closure meant that 40 people lost their jobs.|$|E

However, the situation was quickly turned around. Thanks in part to the SG-1000's steadier stream of releases (21 SG-1000 games by the end of 1983, as compared to only 9 Famicom games), and in part to a recall on Famicom units <b>necessitated</b> <b>by</b> a faulty circuit, the SG-1000 chalked up 160,000 units in sales in 1983, far exceeding Sega's projection of 50,000 units.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each metric ton of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel pickling, glass etching and alkane cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is <b>necessitated</b> <b>by</b> their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23kg (51lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt, nickel, and ammonium.|$|E

In the European context, the limits relating to the maximum levels allowed for these metabolites in foodstuffs, <b>necessitate</b> <b>by</b> companies involved in cultivation and in the subsequent stages of storage and processing, to bear costs and investments to get finished products conform to that regulation. The aim of this work has been assessing the economic sustainability of interventions based on particular techniques of grain processing {{and the use of}} innovative plants by elevators and processors {{in order to reduce the}} level of mycotoxin contamination. The firms examined are a storage center and a mill, located in Northern Italy, which orient their processes in order to achieve production of high food quality and health. The determination of costs and revenues to obtain grain products for human food use, has highlighted that a focused approach on the quality productions permit to obtain broader margin gains and food safety for the consumer. ...|$|R
5|$|Because male-female {{relationships}} are inherently unequal in her society, Wollstonecraft endeavours {{to formulate a}} new kind of friendship in The Wrongs of Woman: motherhood and sisterhood. It is Maria's pathetic story regarding the kidnapping of her child that first interests Jemima in her plight. The novel fragments also suggest that the tale might not end with a marriage, but rather with the creation of {{a new kind of}} family, one constituted by two mothers for Maria's child. With Jemima's rescue of Maria, Wollstonecraft appears to reject the traditional romantic plot and invent a new one, <b>necessitated</b> <b>by</b> the failure of society to grant women their natural rights.|$|E
5|$|Between 1710 and 1713 {{a further}} {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was <b>necessitated</b> <b>by</b> the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the lunettes.|$|E
5|$|Construction on Graf Zeppelin {{began on}} 28 December 1936, when her keel was laid {{down at the}} Deutsche Werke {{shipyard}} in Kiel. Named in honor of Graf (Count) Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the ship was launched on 8 December 1938, and was 85% complete by the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Graf Zeppelin was not completed and was never operational due to shifting construction priorities <b>necessitated</b> <b>by</b> the war. She remained in the Baltic {{for the duration of}} the war; with Germany's defeat imminent, the ship's custodian crew scuttled her just outside Stettin in March 1945. The Soviet Union raised the ship in March 1946, and she was ultimately sunk in weapons tests north of Poland 17 months later. The wreck was discovered by a Polish survey ship in July 2006.|$|E

His only first team appearance of the season was also the last Football League game of his career; it came on 6 February 1965, just after his 50th birthday, and was <b>necessitated</b> <b>by</b> injuries to both Peter Dobing and Gerry Bridgwood.

5|$|In early 1942, the {{two ships}} made a {{daylight}} dash up the English Channel from occupied France to Germany. After reaching Kiel in early February, the ship went into drydock.

The repairs <b>necessitated</b> <b>by</b> the damage were so time-consuming that it was determined to rebuild the ship to accommodate the 38cm guns as originally intended. The 28cm guns were removed and used as shore batteries. In 1943, Hitler ordered the cessation of conversion work, and on 27 March 1945, she was sunk as a blockship in Gotenhafen (Gdynia) in German-occupied Poland. She was eventually broken up for scrap in 1951.|$|E
5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was <b>necessitated</b> <b>by</b> counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering which would make it possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using a collar, into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E
5|$|In {{their efforts}} to monitor the French, Cochrane's {{squadron}} had become divided, so that Neptune and Pompee were the only ships within reach of Troude's squadron when they passed through the channel. Neither ship was well placed to fight the larger French force and both were taken by surprise, only alerted to the French escape by the brig HMS Hazard under Captain Hugh Cameron shortly before 22:00. Pompee was closest to the French, and Captain William Charles Fahie managed to fire two broadsides into the rearmost ship, Hautpoult before Troude's squadron pulled away from her. Neptune, Pompee and the small brig HMS Recruit took up the chase, the fast Recruit annoying the French with persistent minor attacks, while Neptune came too close to Hautpoult and was fired on, losing one man killed and four wounded. The French escape, while <b>necessitated</b> <b>by</b> the British battery, was actually a feint: the frigates Félicité and Furieuse had remained hidden off the Saintes during the night and at 09:00 on 15 April, with the main combat continuing to the west, slipped away into Basse-Terre on Guadeloupe, chased in vain by HMS Intrepid under Captain Warwick Lake. French batteries drove off the British pursuit and the frigates were anchored in harbour and their stores successfully unloaded.|$|E
