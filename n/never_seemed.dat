The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr remembered that the travelling <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain with one of the group in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.|$|E
5|$|Flowing from Auerbach's {{emphasis}} on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams {{was that they}} <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> to have a dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would {{go a step further}} in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history.|$|E

He <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> to take his cricket all that seriously, in that country way. Numbers didn't mean much to him. In a lot of respects he had that 'Hookesy' outlook. Why would you get eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent and I guess that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E
25|$|Adamson was {{replaced}} by former Leeds and England star Allan Clarke. Clarke shored up the defence, ensuring that Leeds survived the 1980–81 season, but {{in the first game}} of the 1981–82 season Leeds lost 5–1 to Swansea City, and the team <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> to recover. The previously watertight defense started to ship goals, and the team seemed unable to score. Clarke spent freely in the transfer market, notably purchasing Peter Barnes, but his impact was slight – between 12 December 1981 and 6 April 1982, the team scored just five goals in fourteen league games. Leeds were relegated at the end of the 1981–82 season; Clarke was sacked and replaced by former teammate Eddie Gray.|$|E
25|$|Maximilian {{was always}} troubled by {{financial}} shortcomings; his income <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to be enough}} to sustain his large-scale goals and policies. For this reason he was forced to take substantial credits from Upper German banker families, especially from the Baumgarten, Fugger and Welser families. Jörg Baumgarten even served as Maximilian's financial advisor. The Fuggers, who dominated the copper and silver mining business in Tyrol, provided a credit of almost 1 million gulden for the purpose of bribing the prince-electors to choose Maximilian's grandson Charles V as the new Emperor. At the end of Maximilian's rule, the Habsburgs' mountain of debt totalled six million gulden, corresponding to a decade's worth of tax revenues from their inherited lands. It took {{until the end of the}} 16th century to repay this debt.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, when {{an offer}} to assume the Presidency of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was made, it was quickly accepted. This company {{operated}} a railroad between Baltimore and Washington, but its ambition was built a route to the Ohio River, and move commerce from the west through the City of Baltimore. In 1837 the western tracks went {{only as far as}} Harpers Ferry, Virginia and McLane’s great accomplishment was seeing to the extension of the “main line” as far as Cumberland, Maryland. This brought the route into proximity with enough coalfields to provide a regular profit. The profits were not substantial, however, and McLane was consumed with financing rearrangements and negotiations with Pennsylvania and Virginia over possible routes west. Ultimately Wheeling and an all Virginia route was decided upon, but it was left to McLane’s immediate successor to see the goal realized. McLane <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> to appreciate the value of this work and ultimately retired on September 13, 1848.|$|E
25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E
25|$|Series 8 and 9 {{featured}} Bodger and Badger {{running a}} Bed & Breakfast {{hotel in the}} fictional seaside town of Puddleford (location filming for series 8 and 9 took place around Brighton). Various guests stayed at the hotel {{over the course of}} the two series and again Bodger kept Badger's presence a secret from all of them. Guests included two Spanish flamenco dancers, Miss Peake (a bad-tempered school teacher), Mr Tucknott (a dim-witted bank manager), the bubbly Mrs Bobbins, Miss Piper (a mad old woman) and Mr Wilson (a pathetic trainee bank manager). In Series 8 the characters of Millie the Milkwoman and China the dog were introduced, who featured in the show until the very end. Millie was friends with Bodger and knew about Badger, as he was friends with her dog, China. Series 8 also featured the return of Mr Smart, as he ran the B next door to Bodger's. Smart <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> to have any guests staying at his hotel and was always trying to steal Bodger's. This was the first series to utilise the 1997 BBC logo and the last series to use the pink background for its title card and end credits.|$|E

One account described Dunlap's throwing prowess as follows: [...] "ndless practice made him adept as a monkey at grabbing a sizzling ground ball in either hand and firing it off from the very spot he seized it.

Stan James of The Advertiser wrote that Warner was wasted in his role and most characters lacked any [...] "drive and motivation". In comparison, Luckinbill's Sybok received praise from critics such as USA Todays Mike Clark, who wrote that [...] "he has the voice and stature of the golden screen's most scintillating intellectual villains", although {{he felt that he}} <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> threatening or suspenseful.

500|$|Frank's Cock won several awards at {{domestic}} and international film festivals. At the 1994 TIFF it won the NFB–John Spotton Award, given for the best Canadian short film. The jury cited Frank's Cock for its [...] "evocative images,... impeccable writing and mise-en-scène,... moving depiction of the universal human experiences of love and loss {{in the age of}} AIDS, and especially for its success in shaking our preconceptions". The selection included C$2,500 in prize money and a further C$2,500 worth of film processing. When accepting the award, Hoolboom quipped [...] "Frank's Cock has <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> so large"; Waugh, however, suggests that the title [...] "caused more embarrassment than mirth" [...] when it was read during the citation. Special citations were also read for Andrew Munger's Make Some Noise and Philip Hoffman's Technilogic Ordering.|$|E

[...] The island had some distinctively eccentric characters: Donald Banks, the island's coffin-maker, was known for quarrelling with his neighbours (telling one family, [...] "I'll no bury any more o' ye!") and combining poetry with coffin-making, as in the order he placed with a mainland supplier: ...|$|E
500|$|Farrell next {{appeared}} in Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream, which premiered in 2007 and was {{distributed in the}} US in early 2008. Reviews were mixed, with Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide writing that Allen's work was [...] "shallow and unconvincing from beginning to end" [...] and Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle saying that although [...] "it's {{not as good as}} Match Point or Crimes and Misdemeanors...taken on its own, it's a fairly impressive piece, a directorially vigorous, well-acted, tightly constructed movie". LaSalle praised Farrell: [...] "Allen is notorious for not giving his actors explicit instructions, and yet somehow this worked wonders for Farrell, who has <b>never</b> <b>seemed</b> so naked, so clear and so unencumbered as he does here." [...] Manohla Dargis concurred in the New York Times, adding that she thought Farrell was well-matched with co-star Ewan McGregor.|$|E
