40|$|Cationic liposome-mediated gene {{transfection}} is {{a promising}} method for gene therapy. In this study, the transfection efficiency and histological patterns were evaluated in rat lung after intravenous administration via femoral vein of <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA,</b> <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> with pretreatment of DOTAP, and DOTAP-cholesterol-plasmid DNA complex. Plasmid DNA encoding bacterial LacZ gene was used. For quantification of LacZ gene expression, beta-galactosidase assay was performed. For histologic examination, X-gal staining and immunohistochemical staining for transfected gene products were performed. Pretreatment of DOTAP {{prior to the}} infusion of <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> increased transfection efficiency up to a level comparable to DOTAP-cholesterol-plasmid DNA complex injection. Transfected genes were mainly expressed in type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages in all animals. We conclude that the high transfection efficiency is achievable by intravenous administration of <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> with pretreatment of DOTAP, to a level comparable to DOTAP-cholesterol-plasmid DNA complex. In this regard, <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> administration with pretreatment of DOTAP could be a more feasible option for intravenous gene transfer than DOTAP-cholesterol-plasmid DNA complex, in that the former is technically easier and more cost-effective than the latter with a comparable efficacy, in terms of intravenous gene delivery to the lung...|$|R

Transient expression of <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> {{could be used}} as a local treatment of various skin lesions where the corresponding gene product (protein) has therapeutic or immunization potential. We analyzed the time course, magnitude, and histologic expression of the indicator plasmid DNA (pCMV:β-Gal) in mucosal epithelium and papilloma lesions. Upon direct injection of <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> (20 μg) into oral mucosa, expression occurred at high local concentrations, up to 35 -fold higher than in comparable injections into the epidermis. Due to the accelerated turnover of mucosal epithelium β-galactosidase positive epithelial cells were detected in the basal and suprabasal layers as early as 3 h after injection, whereas only the most superficial mucosal layers demonstrated β-galactosidase staining at 24 h post-injection. These biologic characteristics need to be taken into consideration when clinical applications of expressing <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> in epithelial tissues are considered...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} an in vitro system in which higher-order chromatin structures are assembled around <b>naked</b> <b>DNAs</b> in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Membrane-free soluble extracts specific to interphase and mitotic states were prepared from Xenopus eggs. When high molecular weight DNA is incubated with interphase extracts, fluffy chromatin-like structures are assembled. In contrast, mitotic extracts produce highly condensed chromosome-like structures. Immunofluorescence studies show that a monoclonal antibody MPM- 2, which recognizes a class of mitosis-specific phosphoproteins, stains the "core " or "axis " of condensed mitotic chromatin but not interphase chromatin. By adding mitotic extracts, interphase chromatin structures are synchronously converted into the condense...|$|R

40|$|Although {{wild-type}} polyoma virus {{does not}} productively infect murine embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, {{a number of}} mutants (PyEC mutants) that do infect undifferentiated EC cells have been isolated. All PyEC mutants have DNA sequence alterations within the enhancer region of the viral genome. This report describes an activity present in nuclear extracts of F 9 EC cells which, by "footprint" analyses, binds specifically to a small region of about 20 base pairs (nucleotides 5180 - 5200) within the subregion of the polyoma enhancer designated as the B or beta element. While no difference in binding of factor was detected between wild-type polyoma enhancer and the enhancers of the PyEC mutants, PyF 111 and PyF 441, which had been selected for productive infection of F 9 cells, definite differences between wild-type and mutants were observed in the digestion patterns of their <b>naked</b> <b>DNAs</b> with either DNAase I or exonuclease III.

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen that is angiogenic in vitro and in vivo. Several studies report on gene {{transfer}} of VEGF 121 to promote angiogenesis in the ischemic myocardium {{of animals and}} patients. We hypothesized that intramyocardial administration of <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> encoding VEGF 121 could improve myocardial perfusion and function in a porcine model of myocardial ischemia. Yorkshire swine underwent thoracotomy and placement of an ameroid constrictor on the circumflex coronary artery. Four weeks later, pVEGF 121 plasmid was administered into the ischemic myocardium. Four weeks after gene transfer, SPECT imaging demonstrated significant reduction in the ischemic area in pVEGF 121 -treated animals compared with controls. In the pVEGF 121 group, most of the animals evolved from light ischemia to a normal perfusion. In contrast, control animals exhibited similar or impaired ischemic conditions. Our results indicate that intramyocardial gene transfer of VEGF 121 as <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> results in significant improvement in myocardial perfusion and function...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{transfer}} to the lung can be achieved via either the airway or the pulmonary vasculature. We evaluated gene transfer and expression by intravascular and endobronchial routes, using DNA complexed with G 9 PAMAM dendrimer or <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA.</b> Intravascular tail vein delivery of dendrimer-complexed pCF 1 CAT plasmid resulted in high levels of transgene expression in the lung at 12 and 24 hr, followed by a second peak of expression 3 to 5 days after administration. After intravenous administration of the complexes, CAT expression was never observed in organs other than the lung. There were only minimal levels of CAT protein expressed in the lung after intravenous administration of <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA.</b> Repeated intravascular doses of the dendrimer-complexed plasmid, administered four times at 4 -day intervals, maintained expression at 15 - 25 % of peak concentrations achieved after the initial dose. Endobronchial delivery of naked pCF 1 CAT plasmid produced significant amounts of CAT protein in the lung. Comparison of intratracheal and intranasal routes resulted in similar expression levels of CAT in the lung and trachea. However, in juxtaposition to vascular delivery, intranasal delivery of dendrimer-complexed plasmid DNA gave lower levels of CAT expression than that observed with <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA.</b> In situ localization of CAT enzymatic activity suggested that vascular administration seemed to achieve expression in the lung parenchyma, mainly within the alveoli, while endobronchial administration primarily targeted bronchial epithelium. Our results show that intravenously administered G 9 dendrimer is an effective vector for pulmonary gene transfer and that transgene expression can be prolonged by repeated administration of dendrimer-complexed DNA...|$|R

50|$|The {{techniques}} above {{have been}} used by scientist, but the most popularized techniques are <b>Naked</b> <b>DNA</b> and DNA complexes.

This form of delivery is sometimes used as a natural compound, but the United States has been making large waves of synthetic compounds for gene delivery. The other form, which is DNA Complexes, has been used when a compound is crossed with a chemical mix in order to produce the desired compound. There are other studies that are currently underway that have been referred to as the hybrid method because there is a combination of two or more gene therapy techniques used. This can instill the idea that the desired gene will stick during the delivery, transfer, and implant.|$|E

Plasmid DNA showed fast elimination kinetics with more than 99 % of the plasmid disappearing within 36 hours. IFN-g expression increased quickly after IL- 12 plasmid injection, but varied between individual horses.

40|$|Conditions {{that favor}} the {{complete}} coating of single-stranded DNA by RecA protein promote {{the association of}} these presynaptic filaments with <b>naked</b> double-stranded <b>DNA</b> to form large nucleoprotein networks before homologous pairing occurs. These RecA nucleoprotein networks sequester {{virtually all of the}} DNA in the reaction mixture. Conditions that are suboptimal for the formation of the RecA presynaptic filament rendered both the formation of RecA-DNA networks and the subsequent formation of joint molecules sensitive to inhibition by excess ATP or by pyrophosphate when these were added during synapsis. The rate of homologous pairing was directly related to the degree of inhibition of network formation. Various multivalent cations added during synapsis restored both the formation of networks and the pairing of homologous molecules. These observations support the view that the nucleoprotein network is a synaptic intermediate by means of which RecA protein facilitates the conjunction of DNA molecules and the subsequent processive search for homology. Inhibition by multivalent anions and restoration by multivalent cations suggests in addition, that negative charge repulsion inhibits the binding of <b>naked</b> duplex <b>DNA</b> to presynaptic filaments...|$|R

40|$|Hydrodynamic tail vein (HTV) {{delivery}} {{is a simple}} and rapid tail vein injection method of a high volume of <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> resulting in high levels of foreign gene expression in organs, especially the liver.

After being bitten by malaria-infected mosquitoes, malaria parasites transiently infect the host liver and form the liver stages. The liver stages are known to be the key target for CD 8 + T cells that mediate protective anti-malaria immunity in an animal model. Therefore, in this study, we utilized the HTV delivery technique as a tool to determine the in vivo cytotoxic effect of malaria antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells. Two weeks after mice were immunized with recombinant adenoviruses expressing malarial antigens, the immunized mice as well as naïve mice were challenged by HTV delivery of <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> co-encoding respective antigen together with luciferase using dual promoters.

40|$|Collagen/calcium {{phosphate}} scaffolds {{have been}} used for bone reconstruction due to their inherent similarities to the bone extracellular matrix. Calcium phosphate alone has also been used as a non-viral vector for gene delivery. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the capability of a collagen/calcium phosphate scaffold to deliver <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> and mediate transfection in vivo. The second goal of the study was to deliver a plasmid encoding vascular endothelial growth factor(165) (pVEGF(165)) to promote angiogenesis, and hence bone formation, in a mouse intra-femoral model. The delivery of <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> resulted in a 7. 6 -fold increase in mRNA levels of beta-Galactosidase compared to the delivery of plasmid DNA complexed with a partially degraded PAMAM dendrimer (dPAMAM) in a subcutaneous murine model. When implanted in a muirne intra-femoral model, the delivery of pVEGF(165) resulted in a 2 -fold increase in bone volume at the defect site relative to control scaffolds without pVEGF(165). It was concluded that a collagen/calcium phosphate scaffold can mediate transfection without the use of additional transfection vectors and can promote bone formation in a mouse model via the delivery of pVEGF(165) ...|$|R

Simple instillation of <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> onto the gastric serosal surface in mice resulted in effective but transient transgene expression. Here, {{we developed a}} simple method to improve not only the transfection efficiency but also the duration of transgene expression. Rubbing the gastric serosal surface using a medical spoon immediately after instillation of <b>naked</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> onto the gastric serosal surface resulted in 59 -fold higher transgene expression 24 h after administration in rats. Without rubbing, transgene expression decreased under the detection limit 7 d after administration. On the other hand, rubbing the gastric serosal surface with a medical spoon after instillation of plasmid DNA prolonged transgene expression for one month. Mechanistic study in mice revealed that improved transfection should not be due to stimulation of cell function such as macropinocytosis by rubbing because rubbing before instillation of plasmid DNA did not improve transfection. Plasmid DNA should enter effectively into cells during rubbing. These findings are valuable to develop an effective method of in vivo gene transfer into peritoneal organs...|$|R

In addition, vaccination stimulated specific CD 8 + T cell responses against these three BTV proteins. Importantly, the vaccine combination expressing NS 1, VP 2 and VP 7 proteins of BTV- 4, elicited sterile protection against a lethal dose of homologous BTV- 4 infection. Remarkably, the vaccine induced cross-protection against lethal doses of heterologous BTV- 8 and BTV- 1 suggesting that the DNA/rMVA-VP 2,-VP 7,-NS 1 marker vaccine is a promising multiserotype vaccine against BTV...|$|R
