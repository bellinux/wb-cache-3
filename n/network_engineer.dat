40|$|Network {{engineering}} {{is a dynamic}} profession that consists of designing, implementing, and maintaining different aspects of network connectivity in a secure manner. As Information Technology (IT) changes and new security threats strike enterprise <b>networks,</b> <b>network</b> <b>engineers</b> strive to provide solutions to defend their networks from such threats. In addition to the demanding job responsibilities and challenges, <b>network</b> <b>engineers</b> are often managed in a fashion that drives them to job dissatisfaction and leads them to pursue other job opportunities.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, an {{executive}} report {{has been presented}} on our experiences in developing a software tool for IP/MPLS NGN traffic engineering computations. The developed NGN software consists of three main modules. Firstly, the NGN design module {{can be used to}} help <b>network</b> <b>engineers</b> find the minimum link capacity needed for NGN unicast service provision (e. g. VoIP service) while maintaining the resultant QoS at a specified target level. Secondly, the NGN performance analysis module is based on a discrete-event simulation of sequential routing and trunk reservation CAC. This module can be used to help <b>network</b> <b>engineers</b> analyse the performance of NGN. It {{can also be used to}} predict the effect of link failure, traffic surge and new routing plan implementation. Finally, both the NGN design and performance analysis modules can be executed via the developed NGN GUI module. With GUI, <b>network</b> <b>engineers</b> can visualise the status of network components. Further, GUI permits both entering and editing all relevant network parameters efficiently. It is therefore very convenient for our developed NGN software to be utilised in practice and should be an indispensable traffic engineering tool for improving the NGN planning and operational tasks.
