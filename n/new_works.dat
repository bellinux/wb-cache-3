5|$|Barbirolli's {{interest}} in new music waned in post-war years, {{but he and}} the Hallé appeared regularly at the Cheltenham Festival, where he premiered <b>new</b> <b>works</b> of a mostly traditional style by William Alwyn, Richard Arnell, Arthur Benjamin, Peter Racine Fricker, Gordon Jacob, Alan Rawsthorne, Kenneth Leighton and others. For its hundredth anniversary in 1958 the Hallé commissioned several <b>new</b> <b>works,</b> including Walton's virtuosic divertimento Partita. Increasingly, Barbirolli concentrated on his core repertory of the standard symphonic classics, the works of English composers, and late-romantic music, particularly that of Mahler. In the 1960s he {{made a series of}} international tours with the Philharmonia (Latin America, 1963), BBC Symphony Orchestra (Czechoslovakia, Poland and the USSR, 1967) and the Hallé (Latin America and West Indies, 1968). It was a lasting disappointment to him that it never proved possible to take the Hallé {{on a tour of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, the Birth of a Museum exhibition, {{featuring}} works {{shown in}} Abu Dhabi {{and a number}} of new acquisitions opened at the Louvre in Paris.

5|$|On 2 March 1714 Bach was {{appointed}} concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. As concertmaster, he assumed the principal responsibility for composing <b>new</b> <b>works,</b> specifically cantatas for the Schlosskirche (palace church), {{on a monthly}} schedule. He wrote this cantata for the fourth Sunday in Advent, dating it himself.|$|E
50|$|Inherent in our {{understanding}} of appropriation is the concept that the <b>new</b> <b>work</b> recontextualizes whatever it borrows to create the <b>new</b> <b>work.</b> In most cases the original 'thing' remains accessible as the original, without change.|$|R

5|$|Szigeti {{was an avid}} {{champion}} of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote <b>new</b> <b>works</b> for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{plans to}} {{complete}} the Northern Heights project were reviewed but no work was carried out. Maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds. Funds for <b>new</b> <b>works</b> were severely limited and priority {{was given to the}} completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault. Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project.|$|E
5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination. Because he had destroyed all his output {{of the last three}} years, he {{had little choice but to}} present <b>new</b> <b>works.</b> He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{raising the}} orchestra's profile and helping it return to prosperity, Solti {{considerably}} expanded its repertoire. Under him the Chicago Symphony gave its first cycles of the symphonies of Bruckner and Mahler. He introduced <b>new</b> <b>works</b> commissioned for the orchestra, such as Lutosławski's Third Symphony, and Tippett's Fourth Symphony which {{was dedicated to}} Solti. Another new work was Tippett's Byzantium, an orchestral song-cycle, premiered by Solti and the orchestra with the soprano Faye Robinson. Solti frequently programmed works by American composers, including Charles Ives and Elliott Carter.|$|E

5|$|Finding its {{locomotive}} {{works at}} Kittybrewster cramped and inadequate, the Great North began construction on a <b>new</b> <b>works</b> at Inverurie in 1898, electric lighting being {{provided in the}} buildings. The carriage and wagon department moved in 1901, the locomotive department in 1902, the offices the following year and the permanent way department in 1905; the buildings still stand and are listed Category B. Inverurie station was rebuilt nearer the works in 1902, and is similarly a Category B building. The Great North built houses nearby for its staff, lit by electricity generated at the works, and the Inverurie Loco Works Football Club was formed by staff in 1902.|$|E
5|$|From the 1920s until 1960, Szigeti {{performed}} regularly {{around the}} world and recorded extensively. He also distinguished himself as a strong advocate of new music, and was the dedicatee of many <b>new</b> <b>works</b> by contemporary composers. Among the more notable pieces written for him are Ernest Bloch's Violin Concerto, Bartók's Rhapsody No. 1, and Eugène Ysaÿe's Solo Sonata No. 1. After retiring from the concert stage in 1960, he worked at teaching and writing until his death in 1973, at the age of 80.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 {{the line}} to Upminster was {{electrified}} and new vehicles were purchased. After the District Railway became part of London Underground, similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935–40 <b>New</b> <b>Works</b> Programme fitted electro-pneumatic brakes and air-operated doors {{to most of the}} District line stock and allowed the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor cars were not suitable for conversion and so some trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957.|$|E

5|$|One of the LPTB's first acts {{in charge}} of the Bakerloo line was the opening of a new station at South Kenton on 3 July 1933.
