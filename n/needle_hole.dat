Distribution of elongation within the zone was the same when estimated by displacement of <b>needle</b> <b>holes</b> or ink marks placed on the epidermis of the elongation zone after surrounding tissue had been removed. Making holes at different locations within the elongation zone did not differentially affect the relative contribution of the damaged or undamaged parts to leaf elongation. These findings demonstrate that <b>needle</b> <b>holes</b> or ink marks in paired leaves can be used to estimate the relative distribution of growth in the elongation zone of undamaged tall fescue leaf blades...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundOver {{the past}} one hundred years, the {{development}} of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) has always involved the struggle against pancreatic leakage. Until now, leakage of the pancreatic anastomosis has remained a common and serious complication after PD. Various methods {{of dealing with the}} pancreatic stump for prevention of pancreatic anastomotic leakage have been described. No matter which method is used, however, pancreatic anastomotic leakage is still most likely to occur when anastomosis involves a normal and soft pancreas. MethodsTo perform a safe and reliable pancreaticoenteric anastomosis, we investigated the risk factors and potential mechanisms of occurrence of pancreatic leakage, including leakage from the <b>needle</b> <b>hole</b> and from the seam between two anastomosed structures, blood supply to the anastomosis and tension at the anastomosis. Based on these findings, we established a new pancreaticoenteric anastomosis procedure – binding pancreaticojejunostomy. The unique aspects of this procedure are as follows. The sero‐muscular sheath of jejunum is bound to the invaginated pancreatic stump, so as to seal the gap between them; mucosa of the segment of jejunum that would eventually be in contact with the pancreatic stump is destroyed either chemically or by electric coagulation to promote healing. There is no <b>needle</b> <b>hole</b> on the jejunal surface of the anastomotic site. ResultsFrom 1996 to 2003, a total of 227 consecutive patients were treated with this type of pancreaticojejunostomy in this institution.

5000|$|The {{advantages}} of the AV fistula use are lower infection rates, because no foreign material is involved in their formation, higher blood flow rates (which translates to more effective dialysis), and a lower incidence of thrombosis. The complications are fewer than with other access methods. If a fistula has a very high blood flow and the vasculature that supplies {{the rest of the}} limb is poor, a steal syndrome can occur, where blood entering the limb is drawn into the fistula and returned to the general circulation without entering the limb's capillaries. This results in cold extremities of that limb, cramping pains, and, if severe, tissue damage. One long-term complication of an AV fistula can be the development of an aneurysm, a bulging in the wall of the vein where it is weakened by the repeated insertion of needles over time. To a large extent the risk of developing an aneurysm can be reduced by carefully rotating needle sites over the entire fistula, or using the [...] "buttonhole" [...] (constant site) technique. Aneurysms may necessitate corrective surgery and may shorten the useful life of a fistula. Fistulas can also become blocked due to blood clotting or infected if sterile precautions are not followed during needle insertion at the start of dialysis. Because of the high volume of blood flowing through the fistula, excessive bleeding can also occur. This is most common soon after a dialysis treatment. Pressure must be applied to the <b>needle</b> <b>holes</b> to induce clotting. If that pressure is removed prematurely or a patient engages in physical activity too soon after dialysis, the <b>needle</b> <b>holes</b> can open up.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPrimary leiomyosarcoma of the {{inferior}} vena cava (IVC) {{is a rare}} disease with fewer than 220 cases reported in the literature. Symptoms usually develop late {{in the course of}} the disease delaying the diagnosis and worsening the prognosis.

40|$|Abstract Background Radioisotope (RI) cisternography is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} examination for the final diagnosis of intracranial hypotension, typically indicating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage as RI parathecal activity. Early bladder filling (EBF) of RI is another important finding. However, whether EBF without parathecal activity represents real CSF leakage due to intracranial hypotension or only an epiphenomenon of lumbar puncture causing CSF leak through a <b>needle</b> <b>hole</b> has been questioned. Methods To address this issue, we performed quantitative analysis of RI cisternography on 171 patients with suspected intracranial hypotension using different needle sizes (22 G, 23 G and 25 G) and compared RI residual activity in the CSF at different time points after injection. We also analyzed occurrence of early bladder filling and post-lumbar puncture headache. Results No significant difference in RI residual activity was identified between the 22 G, 23 G and 25 G groups. The incidence of parathecal activity and early bladder filling was not significantly different between groups. The 22 G and 23 G groups had a higher but non-significant incidence of post lumbar headache. Conclusion The results suggest that needle size, at least for 22 – 25 G, does not affect the results of RI cisternographic diagnostic tests for CSF leakage and bladder filling in intracranial hypotension. </p...|$|E

OBJECTIVE:To examine the feasibility of gelatin sealing sheets using a canine aterial hemorrhage mode 1. METHODS:In vivo degradation of gelatin sealing sheets was examined by implanting subcutaneously in rats. For the hemostatic and anti-adhesion efficacy investigations, femoral arteries of dogs were pricked with syringe needle to make as mall hole, and a gelatin(i. e. experimental group) or fibrin glue sealing sheet (i. e. control group) was applied on the hole to stop bleeding (n= 8). After discontinuation of the bleeding, the skin incisions were closed and re-examined 4 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS:From the degradation study, 4 h thermally treated gelatin sheet which degraded within 3 weeks in vivo was chosen for the further hemostatic study. In all cases of gelatin and fibrin glue sealing sheets, bleeding from the <b>needle</b> <b>hole</b> on canine femoral arteries was effectively stopped. Postoperative adhesions and inflammation at the site {{in the experimental group}} were significantly less than those in the control group (P< 0. 01 for adhesion scores).

A tiny pin source {{of light from the}} aiming beam emerged from the <b>needle</b> <b>hole</b> in the sheath. Using laser protection protocol, the generator was fired for one minute at 14 Watts (W) continuous wave. The sheath and fibre were then examined. In a control experiment, we were unable manually to break a fibre where the coating had been damaged prior to the laser being fired. ResultsThe aiming beam was noted to be concentrated {{at the side of the}} catheter at the point of needle damage rather than at the fibre tip. When the fibre was removed from the sheath the distal length, from the point of damage to the tip, was retained within the sheath. Longer firing with the sheath surrounded by a wet towel or a pork loin resulted in complete severance of the sheath and fibre. ConclusionThere are no firm manufacturer's guidelines on whether Tumescent Anaesthesia should be delivered before or after the laser fibre has been inserted into the patient. Some units performing EVLA prefer to do this with the laser fibre in situ as it is easier to image on ultrasound than the sheath alone. The results of this in-vitro experiment would suggest it is possible to cause sufficient needle damage to fracture a laser fibre when fired. In the interests of safety we would recommend administration of tumescent anaesthesia should always be carried out before introduction of the laser fibre...|$|E

40|$|Needle wells are {{conventional}} well-bores {{that contain}} several hundreds of laterals, called <b>needle</b> <b>holes.</b> The reservoir contact area is increased by these holes, which enables enhanced hydrocarbon production. The <b>needle</b> <b>holes</b> {{are created by}} dedicated pipes that are equipped with nozzles. These pipes are mounted in a special liner that is lowered downhole. By pumping fluid-abrasive particle mixtures through the nozzles, the formation is eroded away and causes the needle to propagate into the reservoir. The transport of fluid-particle mixtures in the narrow annulus of a needle geometry might result in challenges with regards to hole cleaning. Also, pressure losses for these mixtures are challenging to predict. The {{purpose of this study}} was to experimentally investigate the effects of flow rate variations, needle inclinations and needle eccentricity on pressures and hole cleaning in the annulus between a <b>needle</b> and the <b>hole</b> that it creates. From a literature study was determined that the combination of water with 4 vol. % steel particles might be a good mixture for the purpose of needle jetting. Due to strong acceleration of the mixture in the nozzles of the needle, the impact of the particles cause the formation to break and the water subsequently can enter the cracks to remove the rock cuttings. Typical pressures that have to be applied over the nozzles are in the order of 350 bar. The material properties for steel particles and water were used as input for a needle system design calculation. The needle diameter was set at 10 mm and from pressure loss calculations, and the aim to apply maximum pressure drop over the nozzle, the annulus outer diameter was defined to be 16 mm. Typical flow rates needed per needle are in the order of 30 L/min. Steel particle sizes for this system were calculated to be ~ 0. 2 mm. A program of experiments was defined wherein flow rates were varied between 10 - 30 L/min in steps of 10 L/min. Steel particle concentrations were set at 4 vol. % and particle sizes ranged from 0. 2 - 0. 3 mm. These experiments were run in a specially designed setup, wherein the annulus eccentricity and inclinations can be varied over their full range. Experiments were conducted for a concentric annulus in horizontal, vertical and 45 degree critical angle setting. For a fully eccentric annulus, the transport in horizontal and critical angle setting were investigated. In the vertical and critical angle experiments, the flow-direction was set against the force of gravity. Over a small length in the annulus, movies of the particle distributions were recorded by high speed camera. Stationary beds, moving beds and an asymmetric suspension of particles only occurred at 10 L/min & 20 L/min for horizontal eccentric setting and at 10 L/min for critical angle eccentric setting. The pressure losses for water-steel particle mixtures in concentric annuli were all higher than the losses for water flow. However, for increasing flow rates, this difference decreased. During water-steel particle experiments at 10 L/min in horizontal concentric setting, the annulus plugged. This resulted in rapid particle buildup in the annulus and should therefore be avoided. When flowing at 10 L/min in vertical concentric setting, the pressure losses were lower than for flowing at 10 L/min at horizontal and critical angle concentric settings. A pressure loss model for homogeneously suspended particles matched within 10 % accuracy with the results from vertical concentric setting. Furthermore, it was expected that at the critical angle, particle beds would slide back into the hole. This was not observed during the experiments.

40|$|Needle heating due to {{friction}} {{with the}} material and sewing, has negative effects on sewing process. Relatively low thermal conductivity of fabrics will cause thermal degradative effects concentrating on a limited area, placed around the <b>needle</b> <b>holes.</b> Thermal degradation leads to a decrease sewing thread strength, after which follows the melting and his rupture. The main factors that influence needle warming can be grouped as follows:Factors that depend on the material, they are: fiber content, thickness and number of layers, the physical density, structure, finishing treatment, thermophysical properties, etc. Factors that depend sewing: fiber content, fineness, structure and type of wire, twisting, finishing, all the dependence of the material being sewn. Factors that depend on the sewing machine: speed drive needle stitching structure, step size, depth of penetration of the needle into the fabric, yarn tension force, pressure foot on materials, the <b>hole</b> in the <b>needle</b> plate. Factors that depend on the needle: the geometry of the needle diameter {{and the length of}} the lower rod, the length and cross-sectional dimensions of the grooves, the hole shape, the length and shape of the tip and ends of their, the manner of finishing of the surface of the needle through use of the various special plating processes. Working conditions: The length of time sewing and stops, standard microclimate conditions; existence needle cooling systems, provided they do not affect the user...|$|R
40|$|Needle {{punching}} {{of cellulose}} fibre structures was studied, {{in order to}} explore the possibility for a new method for bonding {{to be used in}} the paperboard industry. The interest in such subject was based on the need for stronger fibre-to-fibre bonding in the thickness direction of paperboard. The studied samples were prepared with a laboratory handsheet former, and the sheets were then couched to a three-ply paperboard. The middle layers were needled with and high (60 stitches/cm 2) and low (40 stitches/cm 2) needle stitch density at different needling depths, the different needling depths enabled the use of 0 to 3 barbs of the needle. The needling performed changed both the fibre orientation and the density of the fibre structure locally, i. e. close to the <b>needled</b> <b>holes.</b> For samples <b>needled</b> with two barbs, there were also some fibres tilted in the thickness direction. The local density was estimated to increase around 25 % compared to the surrounding regions. Due to the needling, the peak bending moment was found to increase 8 % and the peak bending angle increased 19 %, measured on three-ply paperboard samples having a middle layer needled with two barbs and the higher stitch density. The bending stiffness and the tensile and compression strength in the thickness direction were also measured, indicating no significant changes by the needling of the middle layer...|$|R
5000|$|The {{identification}} of Harold II of England in the vignette depicting his death is disputed. Some recent historians {{disagree with the}} traditional view that Harold is the figure struck in the eye with an arrow. The view that it is Harold {{is supported by the}} fact that the words Harold Rex (King Harold) appear right above the figure's head. However, the arrow is a later addition following a period of repair, as can be seen by comparison with Bernard de Montfaucon's engravings of the tapestry as it was in 1729, in which the arrow is absent (see illustration above). However, <b>needle</b> <b>holes</b> in the linen do suggest that something had originally been in the place of the arrow, though it may have been a lance rather than an arrow. A figure is slain with a sword in the subsequent plate, and the phrase above the figure refers to Harold's death (interfectus est, [...] "he is slain"). This would appear to be more consistent with the labeling used elsewhere in the work. It was common medieval iconography that a perjurer was to die with a weapon through the eye. Therefore, the tapestry might be said to emphasize William's rightful claim to the throne by depicting Harold as an oath breaker. Whether he actually died in this way remains a mystery and is much debated.|$|R
