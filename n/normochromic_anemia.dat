40|$|Introduction: The {{association}} of anemia with primary hypothyroidism has been common knowledge for many years. However; its pathogenesis {{is far from}} clear in many cases. Often the causes of anemia are manifold. Aims and objectives: In this study, we evaluated the causes of anemia in patients with primary hypothyroidism. Materials and Methods : Sixty adult nonpregnant untreated primary hypothyroid patients with anemia without any obvious cause were included. All patients were subjected to full medical history, clinical examination, biochemical and imaging studies. Serum iron profile, vitamin B 12, folic acid, anti parietal cell antibody, anti TPO antibody, bone marrow study, and stool for occult blood, Coomb′s test, HPLC for hemoglobinopathies and complete hemogram with reticulocyte count were done and analyzed. Results: Normocytic, <b>normochromic</b> <b>anemia</b> was present in 31 patients (51. 6 %) followed by microcytic anemia in 26 patients (43. 3 %). Six patients (10 %) had megaloblastic anemia with vitamin B 12 deficiency including 3 cases of pernicious anemia. Two patients had combined deficiency of iron and vitamin B 12.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{examine the}} type, frequency, severity, and {{predictors}} of anemia {{and its relationship}} with co-morbid conditions among institutionalized people with intellectual and/or motor disability. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study at a public facility for people with intellectual and/or motor disability in Ibaraki prefecture, Japan. Health checkup data obtained in 2001 from 477 people with intellectual disability (male: 286, average age 40. 6 ± 12. 3; female: 191, average age 45. 1 ± 11. 6) were retrospectively reviewed. Results The prevalence of anemia among male participants was higher than in female participants for each disability category (intellectual disability, 41. 1 %, 4. 2 %; cerebral palsy, 37. 5 %, 4. 8 %; Down's syndrome, 15. 0 %, 0 %; severe motor and intellectual disabilities, 61. 9 %, 16. 7 %). Most participants with anemia (93. 8 – 100 %) showed a normocytic <b>normochromic</b> <b>anemia</b> pattern. Multivariate analysis revealed that factors related {{to an increase in}} frequency included sex (male), low body mass index (BMI), use of anticonvulsants or major tranquilizers, and a high zinc sulfate turbidity test (ZTT) value. No clinically diagnosed co-morbid condition was found {{to be related to the}} presence of anemia. Conclusion A high frequency of mild normocytic <b>normochromic</b> <b>anemia</b> in institutionalized people with intellectual and/or motor disability was observed, particularly among males.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Aztreonam is a synthetic, monobactam {{antibiotic}} structurally {{related to}} the beta-lactam class of drugs. It has inhibitory activity against many aerobic gram-negative bacteria, although it does not inhibit gram-positive or anaerobic bacteria.

This untoward effect primarily was manifested as neutropenia, although <b>normochromic,</b> normocytic <b>anemia</b> and thrombocytopenia were noted as well. One week after aztreonam was discontinued, the patient's bone marrow suppression resolved spontaneously.

40|$|Introduction. Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is a multisystemic {{autosomal recessive}} disease most frequently recognized by characteristic respiratory and/or digestive manifestations. Exceptionally rare, {{as is the}} case with the infant we are presenting, the initial sign of the disease can be nutritional deficiency dermatitis (NDD). Case Outline. A three-month-old male infant of young and healthy non-consanguineous parents, born at term after the first uneventful pregnancy, was hospitalized due to atopic dermatitis (AD) -like skin changes, failure to thrive and <b>normochromic</b> <b>anemia</b> (Hb 60 g/L). As exclusively breast-fed, failure to thrive was attributed to hypogalactia and skin changes to nutritional allergy, so that, besides exclusion of cow’s milk protein and other highly allergenic foods in mother’s diet, hypoallergenic milk formula was added to the child’s diet. However, dietetic measures were without effect, and the child was re-hospitalized at age 4. 5 months, this time in the condition of severe malnutrition with hypoproteinemic edemas, extensive dermatitis, moderate hepatosplenomegaly and recurrent <b>normochromic</b> <b>anemia</b> (Hb 57 g/L). After plasma-free erythrocyte transfusion, correction of hypoalbuminemia and two-week parenteral and semi-elementary nutrition resulted in gradual recovery of the child, also including the resolution of skin changes. Having in mind the clinical course of the disease, as well as the response to applied therapeutic measures, CF was suspected as the cause of the child’s problems, which was also confirmed by a high level of sweat chlorine (92 mmol/L) and DNA analysis (∆F 508 /∆F 508).

40|$|Background: Cognitive {{dysfunction}} {{has been}} increasingly recognized in {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) patients. Senile plaques are important pathophysiological characteristic of cognitive dysfunction. The major component of plaques is the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide released from proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Plasma Aβ has been a focus of the growing literature on blood based biomarkers for cognitive dysfunction. Oxidative stress is prevalent in CKD and it {{plays an important role}} in cognitive dysfunction. Increased oxidative stress leads to cause cleavage of APP and Aβ production. The aim of this study is to assess the antioxidant status and Aβ 42 levels in plasma of CKD patients with cognitive dysfunction compared to CKD without cognitive dysfunction. Methods: A total of 60 subjects divided into 30 CKD without cognitive dysfunction and 30 CKD with cognitive dysfunction based on neuropsychological assessment tests. To compare antioxidant status and Aβ 42 levels in plasma, the following groups such as healthy subjects (n =  30), normocytic <b>normochromic</b> <b>anemia</b> (n =  30) and Alzheimer's disease (AD, n =  10) patients were also maintained. Plasma Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were determined by spectrophotometrically. Aβ level was determined by immunoblotting method. The parameters were statistically compared with healthy, normocytic <b>normochromic</b> <b>anemia</b> and AD subjects. Results: Like AD subjects, significantly increased Aβ and LPO level while decreased SOD, CAT, GPx and GSH levels were observed in plasma of CKD patients with cognitive dysfunction when compared to healthy, CKD without cognitive dysfunction and normocytic normochromic anemic subjects. Conclusion: Results suggest that elevated plasma oxidative stress and Aβ were seen in CKD patients with cognitive dysfunction may be attributed to pathological changes within the brain...|$|E

In the present study, markers of iron storage were examined in 27 patients with <b>normochromic,</b> normocytic <b>anemia</b> undergoing acute rHuEPO (150 to 300 U/kg t. i. w.) treatment for anemia. We calculated projected iron needed for new hemoglobin synthesis from the difference between initial and target hemoglobin concentrations, initial iron reserves available from initial serum ferritin levels, and net projected surplus or deficit from the difference between needs and reserves. Of 22 patients predicted to develop iron deficiency (mean projected deficit 268 ± 70 mg), 20 developed evidence of exhausted iron stores (transferrin %sat< 16 or ferritin < 30 µg/liter) before reaching target hemoglobin; two predicted to become deficient (projected deficit < 100 mg) did not; and all five predicted to avoid iron deficiency (mean projected surplus 177 ± 20 mg) remained iron replete. During acute rHuEPO therapy net body iron balance remained neutral in patients receiving no iron supplements and increased 5 mg/kg in patients prescribed oral ferrous sulfate.
