5|$|Various {{antibodies}} {{directed at}} nerve cells {{have been reported}} in Guillain–Barré syndrome. In the axonal subtype, these antibodies have been shown to bind to gangliosides, a group of substances found in peripheral nerves. A ganglioside is a molecule consisting of ceramide bound to a small group of hexose-type sugars and containing various numbers of <b>N-acetylneuraminic</b> <b>acid</b> groups. The key four gangliosides against which antibodies have been described are GM1, GD1a, GT1a, and GQ1b, with different anti-ganglioside antibodies being associated with particular features; for instance, GQ1b antibodies have been linked with Miller Fisher variant GBS and related forms including Bickerstaff encephalitis. The production of these antibodies after an infection is probably the result of molecular mimicry, where the immune system is reacting to microbial substances but the resultant antibodies also react with substances occurring naturally in the body. After a Campylobacter infection, the body produces antibodies of the IgA class; only a small proportion of people also produce IgG antibodies against bacterial substance cell wall substances (e.g. lipooligosaccharides) that crossreact with human nerve cell gangliosides. It is not currently known how this process escapes central tolerance to gangliosides, which is meant to suppress the production of antibodies against the body's own substances. Not all antiganglioside antibodies cause disease, and it has recently been suggested that some antibodies bind to more than one type of epitope simultaneously (heterodimeric binding) and that this determines the response. Furthermore, the development of pathogenic antibodies may depend on the presence of other strains of bacteria in the bowel.|$|E

The preference of animal rotaviruses for these natural N-acylneuraminic acids has not been comprehensively established, and detailed structural information regarding the interactions of different rotaviruses with N-glycolylneuraminic acids is lacking. In this study, distinct specificities of VP 8 * for N-acetyl- and N-glycolylneuraminic acids were revealed using biophysical techniques. VP 8 * protein from the porcine rotavirus CRW- 8 and the bovine rotavirus Nebraska calf diarrhea virus (NCDV) showed a preference for N-glycolyl- over <b>N-acetylneuraminic</b> <b>acids,</b> in contrast to results obtained with rhesus rotavirus (RRV). Crystallographic structures of VP 8 * from CRW- 8 and RRV with bound methyl-N-glycolylneuraminide revealed the atomic details of their interactions. We examined the influence of amino acid type at position 157, which is proximal to the ligand's N-acetyl or N-glycolyl moiety and can mutate upon cell culture adaptation. A structure-based hypothesis derived from these results could account for rotavirus discrimination between the N-acylneuraminic acid forms. Infectivity blockade experiments demonstrated that the determined carbohydrate specificities of these VP 8 * domains directly correlate {{with those of the}} corresponding infectious virus. This includes an association between CRW- 8 adaption to cell culture, decreased competition by N-glycolylneuraminic acid for CRW- 8 infectivity, and a Pro 157 -to-Ser 157 mutation in VP 8 * that reduces binding affinity for N-glycolylneuraminic acid.

Here, we present site-specific glycosylation analysis of IgE from three different sources: IgE from the serum of a hyperimmune donor, from the pooled serum of multiple nondiseased donors, and from the pooled serum of 2 patients with IgE myeloma. The heavy chains were isolated and digested with either trypsin, proteinase K, or chymotrypsin, which permitted coverage of all seven potential N-glycosylation sites. The resulting (glyco-) peptides were analyzed by nano-reversed-phase-LC- MS/MS and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS/MS. Site Asn 264 was shown to be unoccupied.

Our microarray analysis and promoter-lacZ fusion studies showed that the transcriptional regulator NanR, acts as a transcriptional activator of nan operon-I and the nanA gene {{in the presence of}} sialic acid. The putative regulatory site of NanR in the promoter region of nan operon-I is predicted and confirmed by promoter truncation experiments. Furthermore, the role of CcpA in the regulation of the nan gene cluster is demonstrated through microarray analysis and promoter-lacZ fusion studies, suggesting that in the presence of sialic acid and glucose, CcpA represses the expression of nan operon-I while the expression of the nanA gene is CcpA-independent...|$|R
40|$|Sialic acids are {{not only}} the most {{interesting}} molecules in the world, but also the most important”, said by Eric Sixmister set the exhilarating theme {{of the field of}} sialoglycobiology and challenges encountered by glycobiologists working with this molecule (Vimr, 1994). Sialic acids (Sias) are nine carbon acidic sugars typically found as the terminal residue of cell surface sugar chains as well as on secreted glycoproteins and in the extracellular matrix (Varki et al., 2009). The monosaccharide sialic acid is metabolically derived from two „primary‟ Sias; Nacetylneuraminic acid and 2 -keto- 3 - deoxynomonic <b>acid.</b> <b>N-acetylneuraminic</b> acid(Neu 5 Ac) is the most common sialic acid in humans. The molecular structure is shown in Figure 1 - 1. In other mammals Nglycolylneuraminic acid (Neu 5 Gc) which is resulted due to hydroxylation of Neu 5 Ac, is also abundant. The enzyme that mediates the hydroxylation reaction contains a specific mutation in humans, which results in the lack of Neu 5 Gc in normal healthy individuals...|$|R
