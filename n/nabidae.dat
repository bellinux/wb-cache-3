50|$|The insect family <b>Nabidae</b> {{contains}} the damsel bugs. There are over 500 species in 20 genera. They are soft-bodied, elongate, winged terrestrial predators. Many damsel bugs catch and hold prey with their forelegs, similar to mantids. They are considered helpful species in agriculture {{because of their}} predation on many types of crop pests.|$|E
50|$|Members of the {{families}} Reduviidae, Phymatidae and <b>Nabidae</b> are obligate predators. Some predatory species are used in biological pest control; these include various nabids, and even some members of families that are primarily phytophagous, such as the genus Geocoris in the family Lygaeidae. Other hemipterans are omnivores, alternating between a plant-based and an animal-based diet. For example, Dicyphus hesperus is used to control whitefly on tomatoes but also sucks sap, and if deprived of plant tissues will die even if {{in the presence of}} whiteflies.|$|E

These include {{members of the}} families Phytoseiidae, Coccinellidae, Syrphidae, Anthocoridae, <b>Nabidae,</b> and Miridae, Chrysopidae and Coniopterygidae. There are currently four species that are commercially available; they include Delphastus pusillus, Macrolophus caliginosus, Chrysoperla carnea, and C. rufilabris. D. pusillus are a small, shiny, black beetle species that suck out {{the contents of the}} silverleaf whitefly by piercing its shell. Adult and larval stages of this beetle feed at all life stages of the pest. C. rufilabris is only able to feed on the immature stages or the larval stages of B. tabaci.|$|E
5000|$|Himacerus major [...] is {{a species}} damsel bug {{in the family}} <b>Nabidae.</b> It {{is found in the}} Holarctic.The range is from South Scandinavia and the South of the British Isles over West Europe {{including}} the Western Mediterranean , Central Europe and Eastern Europe and in the Caucasus. It is also found in North America. [...] Himacerus major occurs in many different habitats with grass, regardless of the level of humidity. The species occurs on very dry dune habitats, and nutrient-poor grasslands,as well as wet shores of waters without woody vegetation and salt places inland. The species occurs in very large numbers near the coast of the Northern Baltic Sea. Itis absent from woodland.|$|E
50|$|These species overwinters as an adult, {{emerging}} in late spring. There is one generation {{in the northern}} part of their range and two in the south. The adults and nymphs are consumers of a wide range of cruciferous plants(Brassicaceae), feeding mainly on the flowering parts. Among cultivated crops the bugs damage cabbage, radish, turnip, rutabaga, horseradish and rape. They can also develop on many species of wild cruciferous plants and on nasturtiums. Natural enemies include a number of species of parasitoid wasps in the family Scelionidae, some species of predatory bugs in the family <b>Nabidae,</b> a rare parasitic fly Clytiomya continua, some spiders and ants. They can be controlled by crop rotation, the destruction of cruciferous weeds and the use of insecticides.|$|E

40|$|As an {{extension}} of the ongoing cytogenetic studies of the bug family <b>Nabidae</b> (Heteroptera: Cimicomorpha), the first evidence for the tribe Arachnocorini (the subfamily Nabinae), with reference to the Trinidad endemic, Arachnocoris trinitatus Bergroth, is provided. This is an attempt to gain a better insight into the evolution, systematics and within-family relationships of the family <b>Nabidae.</b> The studies were conducted using a number of cytogenetic techniques. The male karyotype (chromosome number and size; sex chromosome system; NOR location; C-heterochromatin amount, distribution and characterization in terms of the presence of AT-rich and GC-rich DNA), and male meiosis with particular emphasis on the behavior of the sex chromosomes in metaphase II are described. Also investigated are the male and female internal reproductive organs with special reference to the number of follicles in a testis and the number of ovarioles in an ovary. A. trinitatus was found to display a number of characters differentiating it from all hitherto studied nabid species placed in the tribe Nabini of the subfamily Nabinae, and in the tribe Prostemmatini of the subfamily Prostemmatinae.

40|$|Background: <b>Nabidae,</b> {{a family}} of predatory heteropterans, {{includes}} two subfamilies and five tribes. We previously reported the complete mitogenome of Alloeorhynchus bakeri, {{a representative of the}} tribe Prostemmatini in the subfamily Prostemmatinae. To {{gain a better understanding of}} architecture and evolution of mitogenome in <b>Nabidae,</b> mitogenomes of five species representing two tribes (Gorpini and Nabini) in the subfamily Nabinae were sequenced, and a comparative mitogenomic analysis of three nabid tribes in two subfamilies was carried out. Methodology/Principal Findings: Nabid mitogenomes share a similar nucleotide composition and base bias, except for the control region, where differences are observed at the subfamily level. In addition, the pattern of codon usage is influenced by the GC content and consistent with the standard invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code and the preference for A+T-rich codons. The comparison among orthologous protein-coding genes shows that different genes have been subject to different rates of molecular evolution correlated with the GC content. The stems and anticodon loops of tRNAs are extremely conserved, and the nucleotide substitutions are largely restricted to TyC and DHU loops and extra arms, with insertion-deletion polymorphisms. Comparative analysis shows similar rates of substitution between the two rRNAs. Long non-coding regions are observed in most Gorpini and Nabini mtDNAs in-between trnI-trnQ and/or trnS 2 -nad 1. The lone exception, Nabis apicalis, however, has lost three tRNAs. Overall, phylogenetic analysis using mitogenomic data is consisten...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} occurrence {{and seasonal}} abundance of aphidophagous predators (Insecta and Arachnida) were determined in alfalfa fields at two {{locations in the}} northeast Iberian Peninsula, using D-Vac and sweep-net sampling techniques. Among the insects, Heteroptera, Dermaptera, Neuroptera, Coleoptera and Diptera were found. The relative abundance of predators was similar at the two locations. Polyphagous predators were much more abundant than aphid specific species. Heteroptera were the most abundant order of insect predators: members of the <b>Nabidae,</b> Anthocoridae and Miridae were very common. Coleoptera were also abundant, represented mainly by the family Staphylinidae. Coccinellidae were less abundant and their occurrence coincided with maximum aphid presence. There was a low occurrence of other aphid-specific predators, i. e. Diptera: Syrphidae and Neuroptera: Chrysopidae. Arachnida varied between localities (from 35 % to 65 %). Over a five-year period, numerical responses by Orius spp., Nabis provencalis and Coccinellidae to aphids were found using polynomial regression models; however the abundance of predators was weakly explained by aphid abundance. Alfalfa, maize and winter cereals share similar aphid predator groups and these crops partially coincide in time, enabling the movement of predators among crops. The persistence of several predatory groups (Anthocoridae, <b>Nabidae,</b> Staphylinidae, Araneae) {{during most of the}} season suggests that alfalfa plays a major role as a reservoir of aphid predators.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{sequence of}} the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the damsel bug, Alloeorhynchus bakeri, has been completed and annotated in this study. It represents the first sequenced mitochondrial genome of heteropteran family <b>Nabidae.</b> The circular genome is 15, 851 bp in length with an A+T content of 73. 5 %, contains the typical 37 genes that are arranged {{in the same order}} as that of the putative ancestor of hexapods. Nucleotide composition and codon usage are similar to other known heteropteran mitochondrial genomes. All protein-coding genes (PCGs) use standard initiation codons (methionine and isoleucine), except COI, which started with TTG. Canonical TAA and TAG termination codons are found in eight protein-coding genes, the remaining five (COI, COII, COIII, ND 5, ND 1) have incomplete termination codons (T or TA). PCGs of two strands present opposite CG skew which is also reflected by the nucleotide composition and codon usage. All tRNAs have the typical clover-leaf structure, except the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm of tRNA Ser (AGN) which forms a simple loop as known in many other metazoa. Secondary structure models of the ribosomal RNA genes of A. bakeri are presented, similar to those proposed for other insect orders. There are six domains and 45 helices and three domains and 27 helices in the secondary structures of rrnL and rrnS, respectively. The major non-coding region (also called control region) between the small ribosomal subunit and the tRNA Ile gene includes two special regions. The first region includes four 133 bp tandem repeat units plus a partial copy of the repeat (28 bp of the beginning), and the second region at the end of control region contains 4 potential stem-loop structures.

More than 90 % of all spiders collected were from eight species of spiders, representing six families. Two theridiids (Theridion dilutum and T. melanurum) were the most abundant, followed by a miturgid (Cheiracanthium inclusum) and an agelinid (Hololena nedra). Predaceous insects comprised 1. 6 % of all predators collected, and were represented by six genera in five families.

Chrysoperla carnea, Chrysoperla comanche and Chrysopa oculata (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae) and Hippodamia convergens (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) were most abundant early in the season. The dominance of spiders may be due to their more stable position in the vineyard predator community compared to predaceous insects.

The MAb reacts with all life stages of C. rubiginosa, shows no cross-reactions outside the genus Cassida (31 herbivorous insect species and 12 potential predators of C. rubiginosa were tested), and is less reactive with other Cassida species than with C. rubiginosa. Specificity tests were conducted using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blot analysis following SDS–PAGE showed that the MAb reacts with a single protein of molecular weight 32 kDa. The immunoblot of a native PAGE showed a reaction with three bands, the monomer of 32 kDa and two bands with approximate molecular weights of 60 and 90 kDa.

Predation preference by N. kinbergii was also investigated. The number of P. xylostella and Myzus persicae killed by female N. kinbergii was not significantly different, but males killed significantly more P. xylostella than M. persicae. Both eggs and larvae of P. xylostella were killed in significantly greater number than those of Pieris rapae in the same feeding arena. Jun Ma, You-Zhi Li, Michael Keller, Shun-Xiang Re...|$|E
40|$|In the {{collection}} of the Leiden Museum there is preserved the holotype of Scotomedes ater Stål. I was much surprised to discover that Velocipeda biguttula Reut. is a synonym of it. Distant described another Scotomedes-species in his "Fauna of British India" under the name: Godefridus alienus, bringing it to the Reduviidae, subfam. Apiomerinae. This was a reason for derision by Reuter, who cited it as an instance of Distant's less trustworthy scientific performances (Reuter, 1905). However, though it seems to have been "bon ton" to ridiculize Distant's views, we are not accustomed to neglect Stål's, and I was much interested to know why Stål had placed Scotomedes without hesitation into the <b>Nabidae,</b> as other authors have been of a so much different opinion. The next author after Stål, studying a Scotomedes-species, was Bergroth, when he described Velocipeda prisca. He brings the species to the Saldidae, to form a separate subfamily of that group. His arguments are rather feeble, as he writes: "The nervature of the membrane, however, has no resemblance to that of a Saldid, only because of the greater part of the other characters of the anatomy, i. e. by the long legs, the large eyes, the structure of the rostrum and of the pronotum, the animal is closely related to the genus Salda, so that the systematic position cannot be doubtful". I need not give instances of long legs and large eyes occurring in almost any family of the Heteroptera. A three-jointed rostrum occurs, except in the Saldidae, also in the Anthocoridae, Cimicidae, Reduviidae, and Macrocephalinae. Interesting in this connection is also Reuter's statement: "As a very instructive instance, in connection with the development of...|$|E
