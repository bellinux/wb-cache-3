40|$|Objective: Librarians are {{not just}} using open {{research}} tools, they are contributing to, even leading, initiatives that develop these tools. SHARE is one such initiative and is creating a new access and discovery tool which addresses the need to maximize research impact. Most access and discovery tools stifle innovation by keeping information about research behind paywalls or in environments that discourage reuse. SHARE is developing SHARE <b>Notify,</b> an open access and discovery tool that is free and encourages use, reuse, and repurposing. SHARE <b>Notify</b> is a dataset of metadata about research events such as articles, datasets, presentations, grant awards, etc. This poster addresses the purpose of SHARE and the development SHARE <b>Notify.</b> Methods: SHARE is funded by Sloan and IMLS; led by ARL and COS; and co-sponsored by the AAU and APLU. SHARE <b>Notify</b> is being developed collaboratively by participants representing libraries, repositories, university administrations, publishers, and non-profit organizations. Results: In 2015, SHARE released a beta version of SHARE <b>Notify</b> ([URL] SHARE <b>Notify</b> harvests metadata from more than 100 content providers including data, institutional, and disciplinary repositories and databases such as CrossRef and PubMed Central. SHARE <b>Notify’s</b> code is freely available on the Open Science Framework ([URL] Anyone is free to participate in and build upon SHARE <b>Notify.</b> During Phase Two (2015 - 2017) SHARE is enhancing the SHARE <b>Notify</b> dataset by harvesting from more sources, adding more identifiers, working with similar international initiatives on interoperability, and promoting SHARE. Conclusions: SHARE welcomes your involvement in ensuring that SHARE <b>Notify</b> reaches its full potential...|$|R
