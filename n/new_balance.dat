5|$|Preceded by the {{publication}} of the re-mastered editions of their first four albums, Girlschool released the studio album Believe in July 2004. The wish to explore new territories is obvious in some tracks of the album, which is the first one entirely composed by the new line-up at Chambers’ home studio. The changed line-up brought a <b>new</b> <b>balance</b> in the band, with Chambers involved in the composition of all songs. Moreover, the chance to use again two lead singers led to improvements in the vocal and choral parts. Unfortunately, the album was poorly distributed and remained unknown to large parts of its potential audience. In 2005, the band re-released Believe in a new package with a DVD containing footage taken from concerts of the 2000s and sold it through their official website. A US and European tour followed Believe first release, but the project for releasing in 2004 a live DVD tentatively titled Girlschool Live at the Garage never materialised. In June 2005, Girlschool did a UK tour with Vixen and another one in November–December with old pals Motörhead, celebrating Lemmy's band 30th anniversary. During the same year, they were also on stage at summer festivals in the Netherlands and England and opened for Alice Cooper in Spain.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the RSK led the Bosnian Serbs to realise that a {{settlement}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be negotiated as soon as possible, and reversed the tide of {{the war against the}} Serbs, giving US diplomacy a strong boost. The success of Operation Storm also represented a strategic victory in the Bosnian War as it lifted the siege of Bihać, and allowed the Croatian and Bosnian leadership to plan a full-scale military intervention in the VRS-held Banja Luka areaone aimed at creating a <b>new</b> <b>balance</b> of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a buffer zone along the Croatian border, and contributing to the resolution of the war. The intervention materialized as Operation Mistral 2 in September 1995. Combined with a NATO air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it led to the start of peace talks that would result in the Dayton Agreement a few months later. The development also led to the restoration of the remaining Serb-held areas in eastern Slavonia and Baranja to Croatian control through the Erdut Agreement, ending the Croatian War of Independence in November.|$|E
5|$|The {{financial}} services industry {{is important to}} Boston, especially involving mutual funds and insurance. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Boston was ranked as having the ninth most competitive financial center {{in the world and}} the fourth most competitive in the United States. Boston-based Fidelity Investments helped popularize the mutual fund in the 1980s and has made Boston one of the top financial centers in the United States. The city is home to the headquarters of Santander Bank, and Boston is a center for venture capital firms. State Street Corporation, which specializes in asset management and custody services, is based in the city. Boston is a printing and publishing center—Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is headquartered within the city, along with Bedford-St. Martin's Press and Beacon Press. Pearson PLC publishing units also employ several hundred people in Boston. The city is home to three major convention centers—the Hynes Convention Center in the Back Bay, and the Seaport World Trade Center and Boston Convention and Exhibition Center on the South Boston waterfront. The General Electric Corporation announced in January 2016 its decision to move the company's global headquarters to the Seaport District in Boston, from Fairfield, Connecticut, citing factors including Boston's preeminence in the realm of higher education. Boston is home to the headquarters of several major athletic and footwear companies including Converse, <b>New</b> <b>Balance,</b> and Reebok. Rockport, PUMA and Wolverine World Wide, Inc. headquarters or regional offices are located just outside the city.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} the direct application of balancing techniques to unstable periodic systems by extending the balancing concepts to arbitrary periodic systems. We extend first the balancing concepts to unstable discrete-time systems by defining the reachability and observability grammians from appropriate {{right and left}} coprime factorizations with inner denominators. Further, we extend this <b>new</b> <b>balancing</b> method to unstable linear time-varying discrete-time systems with periodically varying coefficient matrices. The <b>new</b> <b>balancing</b> approach serves as basis to develop balancing related order reduction methods for unstable periodic systems using accuracy enhancing square-root and balancing-free algorithms...|$|R

There may also be other, non-mixture, variables (process variables) to consider. Here, designs are considered for two types of second-order models in mixture and process variables, including certain mixture/process interactions. Several <b>new</b> <b>balanced</b> D-optimal (or nearly D-optimal) designs are proposed and are compared with quasi D-optimal designs and other balanced designs previously suggested. The properties of these <b>new</b> <b>balanced</b> designs are examined for the extended model with linear mixture by second-order process variable interactions; the designs are either D-optimal or nearly D-optimal and have diagonally partitioned information matrices, simplifying the model building process. An example from the bread industry illustrates the value of such designs...|$|R

25|$|W+K's {{strategy}} for Nike had consistently been to eschew targeting specific target markets, favouring advertisements and sponsorships of athletes with wide general appeal.

However, Reebok had just launched an aggressive new campaign for their new RBK line of shoes, backed by celebrities such as Allen Iverson, Jadakiss, R. Kelly, and Missy Elliott.
