5|$|A further <b>non-invasive</b> {{survey was}} carried out in 1997, as part of the Wessex Hillforts Project, using a magnetometer.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of {{rumination}} {{syndrome is}} <b>non-invasive</b> {{and based on}} {{a history of the}} individual. Treatment is promising, with upwards of 85% of individuals responding positively to treatment, including infants and the mentally handicapped.|$|E
5|$|In addition, in at-risk pregnancies {{due to an}} {{affected}} male partner, <b>non-invasive</b> {{prenatal diagnosis}} can be performed by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA in a blood sample taken from the mother (via venipuncture) between six and twelve weeks of pregnancy. It has no procedure-related risk of miscarriage (excepting via needle contamination).|$|E
5|$|Refinement {{which refers}} to methods that {{alleviate}} or minimize potential pain, suffering or distress, and enhance animal welfare for the animals used. These methods include <b>non-invasive</b> techniques.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} methods {{that can be}} used to deliver breast brachytherapy: Interstitial breast brachytherapy, Intracavitary breast brachytherapy, Intraoperative {{radiation}} therapy, Permanent Breast Seed Implantation and <b>non-invasive</b> breast brachytherapy using mammography for target localization and an HDR source.|$|E
5|$|With {{technological}} {{advances in the}} late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated <b>non-invasive</b> techniques such as {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and electrophysiology to study language processing in individuals without impairments.|$|E
5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} <b>non-invasive</b> technology, which works by {{analyzing}} an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal {{in the belly}} of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E
5|$|Anatomy can {{be studied}} using both {{invasive}} and <b>non-invasive</b> methods {{with the goal of}} obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems. Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Medaka and {{zebrafish}} {{are used}} as research models for studies in genetics and developmental biology. The zebrafish is {{the most commonly used}} laboratory vertebrate, offering the advantages of genetic similarity to mammals, small size, simple environmental needs, transparent larvae permitting <b>non-invasive</b> imaging, plentiful offspring, rapid growth, and the ability to absorb mutagens added to their water.|$|E
5|$|Medical procedures, {{such as the}} {{insertion}} of a central venous catheter {{into one of the}} chest veins or the taking of biopsy samples from lung tissue, may lead to pneumothorax. The administration of positive pressure ventilation, either mechanical ventilation or <b>non-invasive</b> ventilation, can result in barotrauma (pressure-related injury) leading to a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|Romney was {{diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis in 1998 and has credited a mixture of mainstream and alternative treatments with giving her a lifestyle mostly without limitations. In one activity, equestrianism, she has consequently received recognition in dressage as an adult amateur {{at the national level}} and competed professionally in Grand Prix as well. In 2008, she was also diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, a <b>non-invasive</b> type of breast cancer. She underwent a lumpectomy in December of the same year and has since been cancer-free.|$|E
5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a <b>non-invasive</b> finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, <b>non-invasive</b> ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.|$|E
5|$|Captive lemur {{populations are}} {{maintained}} locally {{and outside of}} Madagascar in many zoos, although the diversity of species is limited. Sikafas, for instance, do not survive well in captivity, so few facilities have them. The largest captive lemur population {{can be found at}} the Duke Lemur Center (DLC), whose mission includes <b>non-invasive</b> research, conservation (e.g. captive breeding), and public education. Another large lemur colony the Myakka City Lemur Reserve run by the Lemur Conservation Foundation (LCF), which also hosts lemur research. In Madagascar, Lemurs' Park is a free-range, private facility southwest of Antananarivo that exhibits lemurs for the public while also rehabilitating captive-born lemurs for reintroduction into the wild.|$|E
5|$|Neither the Jewish {{religious}} leaders in Poland nor the authorities allowed archaeological excavations {{at the camp}} {{out of respect for}} the dead. Approval for a limited archaeological study was issued {{for the first time in}} 2010 to a British team from Staffordshire University using <b>non-invasive</b> technology and Lidar remote sensing. The soil resistance was analysed at the site with ground-penetrating radar. Features that appeared to be structural were found, two of which were thought to be the remains of the gas chambers, and the study was allowed to continue.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservation}} {{was carried}} out between 1974 and 1986, wherever possible using <b>non-invasive</b> procedures such as washing with water and a solution of lime, filling gaps and damaged surfaces with soft mortar to prevent the ingress of water and stabilising statues that were fracturing because of the corrosion of metal dowels. The surfaces were finished by painting with a thin coat of mortar and silane to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.|$|E
25|$|Both {{invasive}} and <b>non-invasive</b> {{approaches are}} used. The {{reliability and validity}} of the <b>non-invasive</b> approach has gained some acceptance, although there is not complete agreement on this point. The clinical use of this approach in the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of a variety of diseases continues.|$|E
