In addition to examining the behaviow: of the chip-tool contact stresses, the paper considers the forces acting on the tool and distinguishes three areas: rake, nose, and flank. I t evaluates the rake forces from the photoelastic results directly, estimates the <b>nose</b> <b>forces</b> by making certain assumptions {{with regard to the}} distribution of stresses, and neglects the stresses on the flank. The sum of the forces so obtained is then compared with the measured resultant cutting force; there is good agreement. There is a particularly significant observation which, contrary to previously published results, shows that the frictional stresses vary linearly in the so-called sticking zone and tend towards a constant only at relatively high depths of cut. This is discussed in relation to the general concept of plastic friction and the variation of the coefficienrof friction on the rake face. The significance of the measured resultant coefficient of friction is also considered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the suitable depth of cut, spindle speed and feed rate {{that will be}} chosen during machining. If thus parameters are not considered, this can provoke abnormal tool behavior such as chatter. Chatter will limit the tool life which only can be use {{for just a few}} times. To predict the chatter occurs, the parameters will be use are spindle speed, depth of cut and feed rate. CNC machine will be use. This process will base on dynamic cutting force model for ball end milling. The selections of cutting tool are depends on the process that will done where the chatter can be observed during this machining process. Cold work tool steel (AISI-D 2) chosen as a material and its parameter is 100 x 100 x 25 mm. Cutter used was high speed steel 2 flute ball <b>nose.</b> <b>Force</b> dynamometer will be use to measure force and 27 tests will be done to observe the chatter occur.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mandibular {{advancing}} {{devices are}} proposed as nonsurgical treatment for certain patients with an obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Since they act {{by increasing the}} upper airway calibre, {{the aim of the}} present study was to investigate the changes in respiratory resistance (Rrs) resulting from mandibular advancement. Rrs was measured at the <b>nose</b> by the <b>forced</b> oscillation technique (4 ± 32 Hz). Ten normal subjects were studied under three conditions: resting mandibular position, passive mandibular advancement steadied by a wax bite, and voluntary advancement, in random order. Respiratory resistance was extrapolated to 0 Hz (R 0) and estimated at 16 Hz (R 16) by linear regression analysis of respiratory resistive impedance versus frequency. R 0 (meanSEM= 3. 50. 2 cmH 2 O. L- 1. s in the resting position) decreased significantly with passive advancement (2. 90. 2 cmH 2 O. L- 1. s, p< 0. 001), but remained unchanged with voluntary mandibular advancement (3. 60. 2 cmH 2 O. L- 1. s). Similar results were obtained for R 16. The results of this study demonstrate that the effects of mandibular advancement on upper airway resistance differ, depending on whether advancement is passive or active, and suggest that in order to simulate the actual effects of therapeutic devices, mandibular advancement should be passive...|$|R
50|$|The {{optic nerve}} can be damaged {{when exposed to}} direct or {{indirect}} injury. Direct optic nerve injuries are caused by trauma to the head or orbit that crosses normal tissue planes and disrupts the anatomy and function of the optic nerve; e.g., a bullet or forceps that physically injures the optic nerve. Indirect injuries, like blunt trauma to the forehead during a motor vehicle accident, transmit force to the optic nerve without transgressing tissue planes. This type of force causes the optic nerve to absorb excess energy {{at the time of}} impact. The most common site of injury of the optic nerve is the intracanalicular portion of the nerve. Deceleration injuries from motor vehicle or bicycle accidents account for 17 to 63 percent of cases. Falls are also a common cause, and optic neuropathy most commonly occurs when there is a loss of consciousness associated with multi-system trauma and serious brain injury. In less than three percent of patients, an orbital hemorrhage after an injection behind the eye (retrobulbar block) can cause injury to the optic nerve, but this is readily manageable if it does not involve direct optic nerve injury and is caught early. The role of high-dose steroids and orbital decompression in treating these patients is controversial and, if administered, must be done very soon after injury with minimal effects. In patients with an orbital fracture, vomiting or <b>nose</b> blowing can <b>force</b> air into the orbit and possibly compromise the integrity of the optic nerve.|$|R
