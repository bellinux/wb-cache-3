25|$|Other related Old Norse Tales {{are those}} such as King Hrolfr Kraki, where the main protagonist King Hrolfr of Denmark is tricked into marrying his own daughter. Yet the most {{striking}} similarity to Tolkien's work are the tales of swords such as Tyrfing, that appears in the Hervarar Saga. Svafrlami was the King of Gardariki, and a grandson of the god Odin. He caught the dwarves, Dvalin and Durin, and forced them to forge a sword with a golden hilt that would <b>never</b> <b>miss</b> a stroke, would never rust and would cut through stone and iron as easily as through clothes. The dwarves made the sword, and it shone and gleamed like fire. However, in revenge they cursed {{it so that it}} would kill a man every time it was used {{and that it would be}} the cause of three great evils. They also cursed it so that it would in the end, kill Svafrlami himself. Then there is Dáinsleif, a sword from the legend of the eternal battle Hjaðningavíg, made by the dwarf Dain. Like Tyrfing, Dainsleif gave wounds that never healed and once drawn it could not be sheathed again without killing a man.|$|E

For Camp, [...] "Mixing Beyoncé is a pleasure because she's a real singer and makes it easy. There is hardly an overdub on this project — it's 95 percent live Beyoncé." [...] He further talked about the collaboration with Beyoncé with Mix magazine, saying: [...] "In my 22 years of mixing, I've never come across anyone who could deliver like she does: vocally and her ability to do a show. I've seen this young woman run across a 60-foot stage, hit every note and <b>never</b> <b>miss</b> a thing. And that makes my job so much easier." ...|$|E
