5|$|By then, Brown had put {{his system}} into place: a strict, {{systematic}} approach to coaching combined with a well-organized recruitment network that drew promising young players from Massillon's junior high school football program. He paid <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> race, and brought several African-American players onto the team {{at a time when}} many northern schools excluded them.|$|E
5|$|It {{would be}} as great a farce of yesterday's {{election}} to designate it otherwise than a fraud. It {{was one of the}} worst ever yet perpetrated in the state. The city judges paid <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> any registration either old or new, but permitted everybody to vote, and in many instances without question. Men were marched from one ward to another and voted early and often.|$|E
5|$|Mary strived {{for peace}} in the Netherlands. Charles paid <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the {{problems}} she was facing as governor and often ignored her warnings. One such incident led to Charles's loss of the city of Metz to France. Mary was forced to wage war against France in 1537 and to deal with the Revolt of Ghent between 1538 and 1540. Mary's appointment as Governor of the Netherlands was renewed on 14 October 1540, after the revolt in Ghent had been subdued.|$|E

5|$|The film {{opens with}} Rover, a collie {{playing with a}} child {{in front of a}} fireplace. Later that day, the baby is taken out in a pram by her nurse. The nurse refuses to aid a beggar woman, and is then distracted upon meeting a soldier. While talking to the soldier, she pays <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the baby, and the beggar woman {{approaches}} from behind and snatches the sleeping child.|$|E
5|$|The French met the {{remnants}} of Conrad's army at Lopadion, and Conrad joined Louis' force. They followed Otto of Freising's route, moving closer to the Mediterranean coast, and they arrived at Ephesus in December, where they learned that the Turks were preparing to attack them. Manuel also sent ambassadors complaining about the pillaging and plundering that Louis had done along the way, {{and there was no}} guarantee that the Byzantines would assist them against the Turks. Meanwhile, Conrad fell sick and returned to Constantinople, where Manuel attended to him personally, and Louis, paying <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the warnings of a Turkish attack, marched out from Ephesus with the French and German survivors. The Turks were indeed waiting to attack, but in a small battle outside Ephesus, the French were victorious. The French fended off another Turkish ambush at the Meander River.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April 1999, Kouao and Victoria Climbié left France and {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom, {{where they}} settled in Ealing, west London. They had a reservation in a bed and breakfast at Twyford Crescent, Acton, where they lived until 1 May 1999, when they moved to Nicoll Road, Harlesden, in the London Borough of Brent. On 25 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited Esther Ackah, a distant relative of Kouao by marriage, and a midwife, counsellor and preacher. Ackah and her daughter noted that Climbié was wearing a wig and looked small and frail. On 26 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited the Homeless Persons' Unit of Ealing Council, where they were seen by Julie Winter, a homeless persons' officer. Together, Kouao and Winter completed a housing application form. Kouao explained that Climbié was wearing a wig because she had short hair, an explanation accepted by Winter. Although Winter was shown Climbié's passport (with a photograph of Anna), she paid <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> them, believing that Kouao's application was ineligible {{on the grounds of}} habitual residence. Winter confirmed her decision with her duty senior and told Kouao that she was not eligible for housing. She telephoned the referral across to Pamela Fortune, a social worker in Ealing's Acton referral and assessment team. She did not produce a written or electronic documentation of the referral, however, something which would have helped in double-checking the accounts that Kouao gave.|$|E

25|$|In childhood, Vātsyāyana says, {{a person}} should {{learn how to}} make a living; youth is the time for pleasure, and as years pass one should {{concentrate}} on living virtuously and hope to escape the cycle of rebirth. The Kama Sutra acknowledges that the senses can be dangerous: 'Just as a horse in full gallop, blinded by the energy of his own speed, pays <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> any post or hole or ditch on the path, so two lovers, blinded by passion, in the friction of sexual battle, are caught up in their fierce energy and pay <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> danger' (2.7.33).|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{regardless}} of Einstein's concerns about interpretation issues, Dirac and other quantum notables embraced the technical advances of the new theory while devoting little or <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> interpretational aspects.|$|E
25|$|A program uses syntax to {{manipulate}} symbols and pays <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the semantics of the symbols.

For the program, the symbols are just physical objects like any others.|$|E

He ordered {{the execution of}} Ziying and his family, {{as well as the}} destruction of the Epang Palace by fire. It was said that Xiang Yu would leave behind a trail of destruction in the places he passed by, and the people of Guanzhong were greatly disappointed with him.|$|E
25|$|One {{comes to}} {{manifest}} {{this sort of}} love after seeing beauty here on earth and being reminded of true beauty as it was seen beyond heaven. When reminded, the wings begin to grow back, but as they are not yet able to rise, the afflicted gaze aloft and pay <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> what goes on below, bringing on the charge of madness. This is the best form that possession by a god can take, for all those connected to it.|$|E
25|$|It later {{emerged that}} the {{timekeeper}} had {{believed that the}} first siren had been acknowledged {{when he saw the}} Fremantle players celebrating the win and the umpire calling for the ball. He then began to do paperwork, paying <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the continuing match, and was not made aware that play was continuing until a spectator got his attention by striking his window with an empty beer can. He then sounded the siren a second time, just after Baker's first kick for goal.|$|E

25|$|A running gag {{throughout}} {{the series is}} that Namiko is extremely clumsy, and will very often fall in holes, fall out of buildings (usually out of her classroom window), or off of cliffs. While the students in her class are initially concerned about her many falls, they become jaded by how often it occurs and pay <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> her potentially getting injured {{later on in the}} series. Namiko remains a tough individual though and always recovers after her falls no matter how severe they may be.|$|E
25|$|The {{journalist}} and vice-postulator for Luciani's cause of canonization, Stefania Falasca, published {{a new book}} in 2017 titled Pope Luciani, Chronicle of a Death, in which she revealed that John Paul I had complained of chest pains hours before his death, and the evening before, but paid <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> it and ordered that his doctor not be called to examine the pope. Falasca confirmed that, after interviewing the nuns who found him and documents from the Vatican Secret Archives, Luciani {{died of a heart}} attack in late evening hours of 28 September.|$|E
25|$|Owner {{and founder}} Frederic McLaughlin died in December 1944. His estate sold {{the team to}} a {{syndicate}} headed by longtime team president Bill Tobin. However, Tobin was only a puppet for James E. Norris, who owned the rival Red Wings. Norris had also been the Black Hawks' landlord since his 1936 purchase of Chicago Stadium. For the next eight years, the Norris-Tobin ownership, as a rule, paid almost <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Black Hawks. Nearly every trade made between Detroit and Chicago ended up being Red Wing heists. As a result, {{for the next several}} years, Chicago was the model of futility in the NHL. Between 1945 and 1958, they only made the playoffs twice.|$|E

25|$|On 25 January 2011, {{protests against}} Mubarak and his {{government}} erupted in Cairo and around Egypt calling for Mubarak's resignation. Mubarak stated in a speech {{that he would not}} leave, and would die on Egyptian soil. Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei paid <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Mubarak's remarks and labeled it as a trick designed to help Mubarak to stay in power. In a state televised broadcast on 1 February 2011, Mubarak announced that he would not seek re-election in September but would like to finish his current term and promised constitutional reform. This compromise was not acceptable for the protestors and violent demonstrations occurred in front of the Presidential Palace. On 11 February, then Vice President Omar Suleiman announced Mubarak had resigned and that power would {{be turned over to the}} Egyptian military.|$|E
25|$|Lanrezac warned on 31 July (just before mobilisation) {{that the}} Germans might come further west through Belgium, {{although}} he still thought Sedan their likely objective. His report of July 1914 warned {{that he had}} too few troops to advance into Belgium as planned, and cited a German wargame of 1911 which called for three German armies to march through Belgium. Lanrezac later claimed that Joffre paid <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> his report, but the report did not in fact reach Joffre until 1 August, and Joffre later wrote {{that it would have}} been “premature” to discuss things with Lanrezac while the strategic situation was still unfolding. A fellow officer described the letter, which was to become a key source in the recrimination after the war, as being like a professor’s critique of a B- thesis.|$|E
25|$|In 1606, a {{conflict}} between Venice and the Holy See began with the arrest of two clerics accused of petty crimes, and with a law restricting the Church's right to enjoy and acquire landed property. Pope Paul V held that these provisions were contrary to canon law, and demanded that they be repealed. When this was refused, he placed Venice under an interdict. The Republic paid <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the interdict or the act of excommunication, and ordered its priests {{to carry out their}} ministry. It was supported in its decisions by the Servite monk Paolo Sarpi, a sharp polemical writer who was nominated to be the Signoria's adviser on theology and canon law in 1606. The interdict was lifted after a year, when France intervened and proposed a formula of compromise. Venice was satisfied with reaffirming the principle that no citizen was superior to the normal processes of law.|$|E
