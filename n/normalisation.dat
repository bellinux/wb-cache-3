The Sino–Soviet split had chagrined Premier Alexei Kosygin a great deal, {{and for a}} while he refused to accept its irrevocability; he briefly visited Beijing in 1969 due to the {{increase}} of tension between the USSR and China. By the early 1980s, both the Chinese and the Soviets were issuing statements calling for a <b>normalisation</b> of relations between the two states. The conditions given to the Soviets by the Chinese were the reduction of Soviet military presence in the Sino–Soviet border and the withdrawal of Soviets troops in Afghanistan and the Mongolian People's Republic and to end their support for the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. Brezhnev responded in his March 1982 speech in Tashkent where he called for the <b>normalisation</b> of relations.

[Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]Objectives Peristalsis can lead to confusing FDG PET bowel uptake artefacts and potential for recording inaccurate mean standardised uptake value (SUV) measurements in PET-CT scans. Accordingly, we investigate the influence of different SUV <b>normalisations</b> on FDG PET uptake of the bowel and assess which one(s) have least dependence on body size factors in patients with and without the introduction of the anti-peristalsis agent N-butylscopolamine (Buscopan). Methods This study consisted of 92 prospective oncology patients, each having a whole body 18 F-FDG PET scan. Correlations were investigated between height, weight, glucose, body mass index (bmi), lean body mass (lbm) and body surface area (bsa) with maximum and mean SUV recorded for bowel normalised to weight (SUVw), lbm (SUVlbm), bsa (SUVbsa) and blood glucose corrected versions (SUVwg, SUVlbmg, SUVbsag). Results Standardised uptake value <b>normalisations</b> were significantly different between control and Buscopan groups with less variability experienced within individual SUV <b>normalisations</b> by the administration of Buscopan. Mean SUV <b>normalisations</b> accounted for 80 % of correlations in the control group and 100 % in the Buscopan group. Further, > 86 % of all correlations across both groups were dominated by mean SUV <b>normalisations</b> of which, about 69 % were accounted for by SUVbsa and SUVbsag. Conclusions We recommend avoiding mean SUVbsa and individual glucose <b>normalisations</b> especially, mean SUVbsag as these dominated albeit relatively weak correlations with body size factors in control and Buscopan groups. Mean and maximum SUVw and SUVlbm were shown to be independent of any body size parameters investigated in both groups and therefore considered suitable for monitoring FDG PET uptake in the normal bowel for our patient cohort...|$|R
5|$|On 11 May 2010 the FIFA Emergency Committee {{suspended}} the Salvadoran Football Federation (FESFUT) {{on account of}} government interference. This decision by FIFA {{was based on the}} fact that the statutes ratified by the FESFUT general assembly in August 2009 had not been formally entered in the country's official register, and that the government had failed to acknowledge the authority of the <b>Normalisation</b> Committee set up to represent FESFUT. Consequently, FIFA considered that it was not possible for FESFUT to organise the general assembly in line with the action plan that had been drawn up, and suspended FESFUT. For the suspension to be lifted, Salvadoran authorities needed to recognize the legitimacy of the <b>Normalisation</b> Committee of the Salvadoran Football Association. The suspension was lifted by May 28. By FIFA lifting the suspension, La Selecta was once again allowed to participate in international tournaments at both club and national levels. El Salvador's under-21 team qualified for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games (CAC) tournament in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. However, CONCACAF decided to suspend football at the 2010 CAC shortly thereafter. El Salvador was also able to participate in the qualifying tournament for the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} Cambodian {{conflict}} {{also brought}} an end the ASEAN-imposed trade and aid embargo which had been in place since 1979. In January 1990, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan publicly voiced his support for Vietnam, {{and the rest of}} Indochina, to gain admission into ASEAN. In the period between late 1991 and early 1992, Vietnam restored relations with several member nations of ASEAN. As a result, between 1991 and 1994, investments from ASEAN countries made up 15 percent of direct foreign investment in Vietnam. Aside from the obvious economic benefits, ASEAN also provided a peaceful environment that guaranteed Vietnam's national security against foreign threats in the post-Cold War era, when Soviet aid was no longer available. Thus, on 28 July 1995, Vietnam officially became the seventh member of ASEAN, after leading ASEAN officials invited Vietnam to join at the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok in 1994. Then, in August 1995, the U.S. Liaison Office in Hanoi was upgraded to Embassy status, after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced a formal <b>normalisation</b> of diplomatic relations with Vietnam on 11 July 1995, thereby ending Vietnam’s isolation from the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} occupation of Kampuchea had profound consequences for Vietnamese foreign policy. Since gaining independence in 1954, the Vietnamese communist perspective {{on foreign policy}} had been dominated {{by the need to}} maintain a world order of two camps, communist and non-communist. Indeed, the treaties of friendship that Vietnam signed with the Soviet Union, Laos and the People’s Republic of Kampuchea were consistent with that view. However, the ideological motivations of the Vietnamese communist leadership were proven to be limited and heavily flawed, as demonstrated by the 1979 condemnation of Vietnam after ousting the Khmer Rouge regime. In the years that followed, the Vietnamese Government was left isolated from the world and its efforts to rebuild the country were handicapped by the lack of aid from the capitalist Western nations. Furthermore, the presence of Vietnamese military forces in Cambodia became an obstacle which prevented the <b>normalisation</b> of diplomatic ties with China, the United States and the member nations of ASEAN.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn finitely cocomplete homological categories, co-smash {{products}} {{give rise}} to (possibly higher-order) commutators of subobjects. We use binary and ternary co-smash products and the associated commutators to give characterisations of internal crossed modules and internal categories, respectively. The ternary terms are redundant if the category has the Smith is Huq property, which means that two equivalence relations on a given object commute precisely when their <b>normalisations</b> do. In fact, we show {{that the difference between}} the Smith commutator of such relations and the Huq commutator of their <b>normalisations</b> is measured by a ternary commutator, so that the Smith is Huq property itself can be characterised by the relation between the latter two commutators. This allows us to show that the category of loops does not have the Smith is Huq property, which also implies that ternary commutators are generally not decomposable into nested binary ones. Thus, in contexts where Smith is Huq need not hold, we obtain a new description of internal categories, Beck modules and double central extensions, as well as a decomposition formula for the Smith commutator. The ternary commutator now also appears in the Hopf formula for the third homology with coefficients in the abelianisation functor...|$|R
