5|$|Commercial and {{recreational}} use of waterways can be limited significantly by wind direction and speed, wave periodicity and heights, tides, and precipitation. These factors can each influence {{the safety of}} marine transit. Consequently, a variety of codes have been established to efficiently transmit detailed marine weather forecasts to vessel pilots via radio, for example the MAFOR (marine forecast). Typical weather forecasts can be received at sea {{through the use of}} RTTY, <b>Navtex</b> and Radiofax.|$|E
25|$|The GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System) officer role {{consists}} of performing tests and maintenance, and ensuring the proper log-keeping on the ship's Global Maritime Distress Safety System equipment. Safety equipment includes Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacons, a <b>NAVTEX</b> unit, INMARSAT consoles, various radios, Search and Rescue Transponders, and Digital Selective Calling systems.|$|E
25|$|Telenor Maritim Radio is a {{division}} of Telenor which provides maritime telecommunication services {{along the coast of}} Norway. It operates the civilian network of marine VHF radio, medium frequency and <b>Navtex</b> transmitters and five coast radio stations: Tjøme Radio, Rogaland Radio, Florø Radio, Bodø Radio and Vardø Radio. The agency also issues licenses for ship radios, including callsigns and Maritime Mobile Service Identities, and issues recreational and commercial radio operator certificates. Telenor Maritim Radio is based in Bergen, has 100 employees and a revenue of NOK160 million Norwegian krone (NOK).|$|E
25|$|As of 2012 Telenor Maritim Radio {{operates}} 154 VHF {{stations and}} 32 MF stations. MF stations are operated out of Tjøme, Farsund, Sola, Bergen, Florø, Ålesund, Ørland, Sandnessjøen, Bodø, Andenes, Tromsø, Hammerfest, Berlevåg, Vardø, Jan Mayen, Bjørnøya and Longyearbyen. <b>Navtex</b> transmitters are located at Tjøme, Sola, Ørland, Bodø, Vardø and Svalbard. In {{addition to the}} coast, there is a VHF transmitter with coverage {{for most of the}} lake Mjøsa. VHF stations are also located on offshore installations. Telenor Maritim Radio offers VHF Data, a wireless Internet connection provided via the VHF channels and offers the same coverage as the VHF radio. The Norwegian Armed Forces have a military network of about 35 VHF stations along the coast.|$|E

50|$|<b>Navtex</b> is a {{component}} of the International Maritime Organization/International Hydrographic Organization Worldwide Navigation Warning Service (WWNWS). <b>Navtex</b> is also a major element of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS).

50|$|<b>Navtex</b> {{receivers}} {{which are}} approved for GMDSS contain an internal printer and/or a scrollable display, and cost between $800-$1500. A {{new generation of}} <b>navtex</b> receivers intended for non-GMDSS applications such as the recreational community is entering the marketplace. These receivers include features such as LCD screens and RS-232 output and have a purchase price in the $300-$500 range. In the UK they can be purchased for £115. There are also a number of <b>navtex</b> engines available {{that do not have}} any user interface, and just output decoded data in RS-232 format, either as a simple ASCII data stream, or using the NMEA <b>navtex</b> sentences, or their own proprietary protocol.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to equipment listed below, all GMDSS-regulated ships must carry a satellite EPIRB, a <b>NAVTEX</b> receiver (if they travel in any areas served by <b>NAVTEX),</b> an Inmarsat-C SafetyNET receiver (if they travel in any areas not served by <b>NAVTEX),</b> a DSC-equipped VHF radiotelephone, two (if between 300 {{and less than}} 500 GRT) or three VHF handhelds (if 500 GRT or more), and two 9 GHz search and rescue radar transponders (SART).|$|E
50|$|Other {{transmission}} modes (like MT63, or Olivia) {{with better}} error correction properties have emerged since <b>navtex</b> was made {{the standard for}} maritime information transmissions.

50|$|At 0000 UTC on August 3, the JMA {{placed the}} Moji and Yokohama <b>navtex</b> areas under a gale warning, six hours later they also placed the Naha <b>navtex</b> area under a gale warning. Later {{that day at}} 1800 UTC, the JMA {{canceled}} the gale warnings for the Yokohama <b>navtex</b> area however at 0600 UTC {{the next morning the}} gale warning for Yokohama was reissued. The JMA kept these warnings in force before they were upgraded to a typhoon warnings as Morakot intensified into a typhoon on August 5. Early the next day, US military installations on Okinawa raised their Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) from level 4 to level 3 which meant that winds exceeding 50 knots (93 km/h, 57 mph) were expected to affect Okinawa within 48 hours. This came as the JMA canceled the warning for Yokohama.|$|E

50|$|<b>Navtex</b> (Navigational Telex) is an {{international}} automated medium frequency direct-printing service for delivery of navigational and meteorological warnings and forecasts, as well as urgent maritime safety information to ships.|$|E
50|$|A {{ship-to-shore}} {{radio station}} {{was established in}} 1900, and Niton Radio (callsign GNI) was maintained as a coastal radio station known to yachtmasters. It was featured in a British Telecom International information film. It finally closed, {{along with the rest}} of the coastal radio network, in 1997. The <b>Navtex</b> transmitter at St. Catherine's Lighthouse is still in operation as of 2013 (<b>Navtex</b> is a shore-to-ship service). For the purpose of extended Shipping forecasts, the Met Office uses Niton as the name of the forecast area covering the Atlantic from FitzRoy, North to Irish Sea and East to Thames.|$|E
50|$|<b>Navtex</b> {{transmissions}} {{are also}} called narrow-band direct printing (NBDP). The transmissions are layered {{on top of}} SITOR collective B-mode. SITOR-B is a forward error correcting (FEC) broadcast that uses the CCIR 476 character set.|$|E
50|$|Satellite systems {{operated}} by the Inmarsat company, overseen by the International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO) are also important elements of the GMDSS. The types of Inmarsat ship earth station terminals recognized by the GMDSS are: Inmarsat B, C and F77. Inmarsat B and F77, {{an updated version of}} the now redundant Inmarsat A, provide ship/shore, ship/ship and shore/ship telephone, telex and high-speed data services, including a distress priority telephone and telex service to and from rescue coordination centers. Fleet 77 fully supports the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) and includes advanced features such as emergency call prioritisation. The Inmarsat C provides ship/shore, shore/ship and ship/ship store-and-forward data and email messaging, the capability for sending preformatted distress messages to a rescue coordination center, and the Inmarsat C SafetyNET service. The Inmarsat C SafetyNET service is a satellite-based worldwide maritime safety information broadcast service of high seas weather warnings, NAVAREA navigational warnings, radionavigation warnings, ice reports and warnings generated by the USCG-conducted International Ice Patrol, and other similar information not provided by <b>NAVTEX.</b> SafetyNET works similarly to <b>NAVTEX</b> in areas outside <b>NAVTEX</b> coverage.|$|E
