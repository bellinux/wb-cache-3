5|$|As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat {{a variety}} of {{different}} foods. A balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5–7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, and seeds that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency.</b>|$|E
5|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> in the world. When loss of iron is not adequately compensated by adequate dietary iron intake, a state of latent iron deficiency occurs, which over time leads to iron-deficiency anemia if left untreated, which is characterised by an insufficient number of red blood cells and an insufficient amount of hemoglobin. Children, pre-menopausal women (women of child-bearing age), and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease. Most cases of iron-deficiency anemia are mild, but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth in infants and children.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the studies}} {{conducted}} that observe alcoholic polyneuropathy in patients are often criticized for their criteria used to assess <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> in the subjects because {{they may not have}} completely ruled out the possibility of a <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> in the genesis of the polyneuropathy. Many researchers favor the nutritional origin of this disease, but the possibility of alcohol having a toxic effect on the peripheral nerves has not been completely ruled out.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPatients {{undergoing}} {{bariatric surgery}} are {{at increased risk}} of developing <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> from the limited intake and absorption of different nutrients. Thus, a systematic review on PubMed and ISI Web of Science was conducted, including articles from September 1983 to April 2010, to identify literature regarding <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> following bariatric surgery and how treatment is carried out. The keywords used individually or in combinations were: bariatric surgery, obesity, vitamin/mineral deficiencies, protein deficiency, nutrient absorption, and nutrient supplementation. The literature suggests the use of nutritional supplementation to prevent or treat <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> resulting from anatomical changes due to surgical techniques. The success of oral nutritional supplementation in correcting or preventing <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> depends on several factors. Thus, it is very important in clinical practice to understand how the nutrients can be administered.

25|$|Further {{research}} {{is looking at}} the effect an alcoholics’ consumption and choice of alcoholic beverage on their development of alcoholic polyneuropathy.

25|$|Cat food is {{food for}} {{consumption}} by cats. Cats have requirements for their specific dietary nutrients. Certain nutrients, including many vitamins and amino acids, are degraded by the temperatures, pressures and chemical treatments used during manufacture, and hence must be added after manufacture to avoid <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency.</b> The amino acid taurine, for example, which is found within meat, is degraded during processing, so synthetic taurine is normally added afterwards.

25|$|Frequently alcoholics have {{disrupted}} social {{links in}} their lives and have an irregular lifestyle. This may cause an alcoholic to change their eating habits including more missed meals and a poor dietary balance. Alcoholism may also result in loss of appetite, alcoholic gastritis, and vomiting, which decrease food intake. Alcohol abuse damages the lining of the gastrointestinal system and reduces absorption of nutrients that are taken in. The combination of all of them may result in a <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency</b> that is linked to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholic {{polyneuropathy}} (A.K.A alcohol leg) is {{a neurological}} disorder in which multiple peripheral nerves {{throughout the body}} malfunction simultaneously. It is defined by axonal degeneration in neurons of both the sensory and motor systems and initially occurs at the distal ends of the longest axons in the body. This nerve damage causes an individual to experience pain and motor weakness, first in the feet and hands and then progressing centrally. Alcoholic polyneuropathy is caused primarily by chronic alcoholism; however, vitamin deficiencies are also known to contribute to its development. This disease typically occurs in chronic alcoholics who {{have some sort of}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Treatment may involve nutritional supplementation, pain management, abstaining from alcohol.|$|E
