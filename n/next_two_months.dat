40|$|One {{of major}} {{difference}} {{of the characteristics}} between warrants and options in Taiwan is that the former are issued by the qualified securities firms, ruled by Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSEC), and the later offered by the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX), who actively list three (the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> quarterly <b>months)</b> or five (the spot <b>month</b> and the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> calendar <b>months)</b> in-the-money series and out-of-the-money ones, respectively. In other words, TAIFEX will regularly list options on TSEC index and others, such as TSEC electric or financial indexes and individual security options, when specific options are in maturity. In contrast, warrants issues could act with a phenomenon of hot issuing period viewed {{as a kind of}} herding effect, when the market atmosphere is favorable. Most important, it could be an information asymmetric problem between the warrant issuers and potential investors, since the formers issue the warrant in the beginnings and occupy the largest percentage of the warrants.
