5|$|Though usually {{opposing}} {{each other}} in their reporting of events, reporting by both the Epitaph and the <b>Nugget</b> initially supported the lawmen's version of events. Woods, the publisher of the pro-Cowboy <b>Nugget,</b> was out of town during the hearings, and an experienced reporter, Richard Rule, wrote the story. The <b>Nugget</b> staff had a close relationship with Sheriff Behan, but Rule's story, as printed in the <b>Nugget</b> the day after the shootout, backed up the Earps' version of events. This varied widely from Behan's and the Cowboys' later court testimony. Subsequent stories about the gunfight published in the <b>Nugget</b> after that day supported Behan's and the Cowboys' view of events. Other stories in the Epitaph countered the Nuggets later view entirely and supported the lawmen. In addition, Dr. George Goodfellow, who examined the Cowboys after their death, told the court that the angle of the wound in Billy Clanton's wrist indicated that his hands could not have been in the air, or holding his coats open by the lapels, as witnesses loyal to the Cowboys testified.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the quality of <b>nuggets</b> prepared from spent hen and duck meat. The cooked <b>nuggets</b> were analyzed for pH, thiobarbituric acid (TBA), tyrosine value (TV), moisture, fat, protein, total plate count (TPC) and sensory evaluations. <b>Nuggets</b> prepared from spent hen meat showed significantly higher (p< 0. 05) moisture content however pH, fat and protein content were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in duck <b>nuggets.</b> TBA values, TVs and (TPC) were highest in duck <b>nuggets</b> but were within the acceptable level up to 7 th day of refrigerated storage (4 ± 1 °C) in both types of <b>nuggets.</b> Both <b>nuggets</b> maintain their sensory quality up to 7 th day of refrigeration storage but spent hen <b>nuggets</b> were preferred by consumers compared to <b>nuggets</b> prepared from spent duck meat. Result of the study indicated that, despite the comparative differences among these <b>nuggets,</b> spent duck and hen meat could be used for preparation of nutritionally rich and acceptable <b>nuggets...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the remote}} Klondike, {{there was great}} demand for news and contact with the world outside. During {{the first months of}} the stampede in 1897, it was said that no news was too old to be read. In the lack of newspapers, some prospectors would read can labels until they knew them by heart. The {{following}} year, two teams fought their way over the passes to reach Dawson City first, complete with printing-presses, with the aim of gaining control of the newspaper market. Gene Kelly, the editor of the Klondike <b>Nugget</b> arrived first, but without his equipment, and it was the team behind the Midnight Sun who produced the first daily newspaper in Dawson. The Dawson Miner followed shortly after, bringing the number of daily newspapers in the town during the gold rush up to three. The <b>Nugget</b> sold for $24 ($680) as an annual subscription, and became well known for championing popular causes associated with miners and for its lucid coverage of scandals. Paper was often hard to find and during the winter of 1898–99, the <b>Nugget</b> had to be printed on butcher's wrapping paper. In the lack of paper, news could be told. In June, 1898, a prospector bought an edition of the Seattle Post-Intellinger at an auction and charged spectators a dollar each to have it read aloud in one of Dawson's halls.|$|E

5|$|The South Island's southernmost point, Slope Point, {{projects}} {{near the}} southwestern {{corner of the}} Catlins. To the west of this lies Waipapa Point, often considered the boundary of the Catlins region, beyond which lies the swampy land around {{the mouth of the}} Mataura River at the eastern end of Toetoes Bay. But various people place the western boundary of the Catlins region in different places, and some more stringent definitions exclude even Slope Point. A proposed boundary circulated in 2009 by the New Zealand Geographic Board ran roughly north from Slope Point, then inland around the Catlins Ranges and east to <b>Nugget</b> Point. Tourist organisations objected, asking that the boundary be moved further west to include Fortrose.|$|E
5|$|Starting at the easternmost Nevada exit of I-80, BL-80 heads south, {{concurrent}} with US93Alt. {{until it}} intersects with, and turns east onto, Wendover Boulevard.

40|$|Abstract. Osmium isotope {{ratios for}} {{two types of}} plati-num group mineral (PGM) <b>nuggets</b> of eluvial (residual) origin, {{associated}} with the Freetown Layered Gabbro Complex, were determined in-situ using an ion micro-probe. The values for erlichmanite <b>nuggets</b> are ~ 1. 08. Those for PGM inclusions in P t-Fe alloy <b>nuggets</b> are higher, ranging from 1. 2 to 2. 1. Ratios of 187 Os/ 186 Os vary between the <b>nuggets,</b> but they are consistent within individual <b>nuggets.</b> The data suggest early formation of the erlichmanite <b>nuggets,</b> prior to a postulated substan-tial contribution of crustal Os. The P t- Fe alloy <b>nuggets,</b> on the other hand, were formed later in a residual melt which was contaminated by crustal Os due to the assimi-lation (< 10 %) or the gaseous/fluid transport of Os from Archaean host rocks into the magma. The lack of sys-tematic mineralogical nd chemical changes of the Com-plex and extensive granulitization i the adjacent host rocks and xenoliths may favor the latter process. The lack of high Ia 7 Os/ZS 6 Os ratios, consistent ~ 87 Os/ 186 Os values within individual <b>nuggets</b> and their textures and mineralogy suggest hat the studied PGM <b>nuggets</b> were not formed during lateritization or in low-tempera-ture depositional environments...|$|R

5|$|Some of PETA's {{earliest}} {{forays into}} gaming include Flash-based games such as Make Fred Spew (2001) and Save the Chicks (2003), which were included {{as part of}} PETA's anti-dairy and Kentucky Fried Cruelty campaigns. These games received some coverage in academic and news sources, and PETA's head of online marketing, Joel Bartlett, identified their 2004 Revenge of the PETA Tomatoes and the Frogger parody, Lobster Liberation, {{as some of the}} organization's earliest released games. However it was not until 2007 that PETA began to attract wider attention within the gaming community with its release of Super Chick Sisters, a parody of Super Mario Bros. Controlling two female chicks named <b>Nugget</b> and Chickette, the player sets out to rescue vegetarian actress Pamela Anderson, who has publicly revealed animal cruelty endemic to KFC's food production, from KFC's mascot Colonel Sanders. In 2009, the game was met with a sequel, New Super Chick Sisters, a homage to New Super Mario Bros. In this game, McDonald's mascot Ronald McDonald kidnaps Anderson with the intent of using her as a Happy Meal ingredient, and the Chick Sisters must rescue her again.|$|E
5|$|The route {{passes to}} the west of the Golden <b>Nugget</b> casino and comes to a ramp that {{provides}} access from northbound Route 87 to both the Trump Marina and Harrah's Atlantic City casinos before passing under the northbound Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector again. Immediately after, the route has a ramp from the southbound direction that provides access to the connector and westbound U.S. Route 30. The northbound Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector parallels Route 87 to the east as it turns northeast and comes to a right-in/right-out in the southbound direction that serves both Harrah's and Borgata. From here, the route passes to the southeast of Harrah's. The northbound Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector merges onto northbound Route 87 before the route comes to a ramp that provides access to the northbound direction of the route from Harrah's. Past here, the route crosses over the Absecon Channel on the Justice Vincent S. Haneman Memorial Bridge and runs along the border of Atlantic City to the northwest and Brigantine to the southeast. After crossing the Absecon Channel, the route arrives on Brigantine Island and passes through wetlands, with U-turn ramps in both directions. A short distance later, Route 87 ends and County Route 638 continues along Brigantine Boulevard through Brigantine.|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{was seen}} {{much more in}} The Next Generation. She was the prime {{babysitter}} and target for roving males, particularly Wilson from the Commandos. In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but slipped and fell, injuring one of her front paws. The Whiskers moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, <b>Nugget</b> and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters {{decided to take the}} pups foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for bolt hole. Inside, Simon found a puff adder, but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited the pups with the Whiskers, but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had done to her, Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a Genet and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the Whiskers. She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, Pickle and Chips, and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the Whiskers to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the Whiskers and still retains that position today.|$|E
