25|$|The {{gap between}} rich and poor is {{enormous}} in a country that was once the most egalitarian nation in the world. In the youth movements, Zionism was seen as the Jewish way of achieving social justice that would encompass the whole world. That ideal has been shattered. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> pretension of being an open and attentive socialist welfare state, but in fact, that message only comes from a single direction. The system only responds to those who shout. Those who are silent remain on the outside. The basic human element has disappeared from the system.|$|E
2500|$|The album's release fueled {{a dispute}} between Trauma and Interscope Records over No Doubt's {{recording}} contract. Trauma sued for US$100 million for breach of contract, fraud, and extortion {{and sought to}} have its joint venture agreement ended, claiming that Interscope had reneged on its contract after the band had become more successful than expected. No Doubt had previously stated that it had switched to Trauma Records and that the transition was [...] "really great...because <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> attention and {{the focus of a}} small indie label." [...] The case was settled out of court with a $3 million payment.|$|E

2500|$|The Nation of Islam {{teaches that}} black people are the {{original}} people, and that all other people come from them. Farrakhan has stated, regarding spiritual ascension, [...] "If {{you look at the}} human family—now, I'm talking about black, brown, red, yellow and white—we all seem to be frozen on a subhuman level of existence. In Islam and, I believe, in Christian theology and Jewish theology as well, there are three stages of human development. The first stage is called the animalistic stage of development. But when we submit to animal passions, then we can do evil things to one another in that animalistic stage of development. But when moral consciousness comes and we have a self-accusing spirit, it is then that we become human beings. Right <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> potential for humanity, but we have not reached that potential, because we are functioning on the animalistic plane of existence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times {{commented on}} {{parallels}} drawn between the Visitors and President Barack Obama, insofar as: [...] "The instant adoration, the attractiveness and rhetorical skills of Anna, {{the idea that}} the Visitors will woo us with universal healthcare and then destroy us all seem a right-wingish take on the president's ascendancy." [...] She continued: [...] "Perhaps that is the creators' intent, but most successful science fiction contains an element of, if not outright humor, then the absurd. That the human race will be enslaved not through brainwashing or firepower but adequate healthcare is pretty hilarious in a dark and almost possible way. And Anna and her crew seem to embody more of a Wall Street deregulated/Bernie Madoff mentality—big returns for minimum investment. And we all know how that turns out." [...] Linda Stasi for The New York Post conversely compared the Visitors to extremist Muslims. Though in the original series the aliens were a metaphor for Nazis, Stasi commented: [...] "TV shows no longer have to rely on Nazis, because <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> hated extremist Muslims to make all bad-guy metaphors with", adding on the Visitors' appearance: [...] "Once you peel back the outer, good-looking shell, you've got your standard outer-space Nazi/Taliban lizard person lurking beneath." ...|$|E

His linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they?

The {{whole story}} told by Barker is a lie. But Barker's story is corroborated by Mrs. Douglas. Therefore she is lying also. They are both lying, and in a conspiracy. So <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> clear problem. Why are they lying, {{and what is the}} truth which they are trying so hard to conceal? Let us try, Watson, you and I, if we can get behind the lie and reconstruct the truth.|$|E
60|$|Calmly considered, she was preposterously thin, but men, at least, {{could not}} think merely of her thinness, unless, when walking with her, they became fascinated by its shadow on the ground. She was tall, and had a very clear, pale {{complexion}} and light-brown hair. Light brown, too, were her heavy eyelashes, which were famous for being black-tipped, as if a brush had touched them, though it had not. She made play with her eyelashes as with a fan, and sometimes {{the upper and lower}} seemed to entangle for a moment and be in difficulties, from which you wanted to extricate them in the tenderest manner. And the more you wanted to help her the more disdainfully she looked at you. Yet though she looked disdainful she also looked helpless. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> secret of her charm.|$|E

60|$|I {{am a man}} {{who looks}} now {{towards the end of}} life; fifty-one years have I {{scratched}} off from my calendar, another slips by, and I cannot tell how many more of the sparse remainder of possible years are really mine. I live in days of hardship and privation, when it seems more natural to feel ill than well; without holidays or rest or peace; friends and the sons of my friends have been killed; death seems to be feeling always now for those I most love; the newspapers that come in to my house tell mostly of blood and disaster, of drownings and slaughterings, of cruelties and base intrigues. Yet never have I been so sure that there is a divinity in man and that a great order of human life, a reign of justice and world-wide happiness, of plenty, power, hope, and gigantic creative effort, lies close at hand. Even <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> science and the ability available for a universal welfare, though it is scattered about the world like a handful of money dropped by a child; even now there exists all the knowledge that is needed to make mankind universally free and human life sweet and noble. We need but the faith for it, and it is at hand; we need but the courage to lay our hands upon it and in a little space of years it can be ours.|$|E
60|$|Co-operating with Hyndford, {{from the}} Vienna side, is Excellency Robinson; {{who has a}} still harder job of it there. Pity poor Robinson, O English reader, if you can for indignation at the {{business}} he is in. Saving the Liberties of Europe! thinks Robinson confidently: Founding the English National Debt, answers Fact; and doing Bottom the Weaver, with long ears, in the miserablest Pickleherring Tragedy that ever was!--This is the same Robinson who immortalized himself, nine or ten years ago, by the First Treaty of Vienna; thrice-salutary Treaty, which DISJOINED Austria from Bourbon-Spanish Alliances, and brought her {{into the arms of}} the grateful Sea-Powers again. Imminent Downfall of the Universe was thus, glory to Robinson, arrested for that time. And <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same Robinson instructed to sharpen all his faculties to the cutting pitch, and do the impossible for this new and reverse face of matters. What a change from 1731 to 1741! Bugbear of dreadful Austrian-Spanish Alliance dissolves now into sunlit clouds, encircling a beautiful Austrian Andromeda, about to be devoured for us; and the Downfall of the Universe is again imminent, from Spain and others joining AGAINST Austria. Oh, ye wigs, and eximious wig-blocks, called right-honorable! If a man, sovereign or other, were to stay well at home, and mind his own visible affairs, trusting a good deal that the Universe would shift for itself, might it not be better for him? Robinson, who writes rather a heavy style, but is full of inextinguishable heavy zeal withal, will have {{a great deal to do}} in these coming years. Ancestor of certain valuable Earls that now are; author of immeasurable quantities of the Diplomatic cobwebs that then were.|$|E
6000|$|... "I neither consented nor {{absolutely}} refused," [...] I answered. [...] "It was not {{a matter}} to be decided {{on the spur of}} the moment. But the more I think of it, the more I am puzzled. Madame Richard wants Isobel. She was not satisfied with our refusal to give her up. She sent that messenger of hers back with fresh offers, and when again we refused, the woman takes up her quarters here, always spying upon us, always accosting Isobel on any excuse. Madame Richard may be a very good woman, but I have seen and spoken with her, and I do not for one moment believe that her extraordinary persistence is for Isobel's sake alone. Then Lady Delahaye has never ceased from worrying us. She has tried threats, persuasions and entreaties. She has tried by every means in her power to induce us to give up the child to her. And <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Archduchess to deal with, and it seems to me that we are getting very near the heart of the matter. The Archduchess is a daughter of one of the Royal Houses of Europe, and Major Delahaye was once attaché at her father's Court. Then there is Grooten, the man who shot Delahaye. His interest in her is so strong that he risks his life and commits a crime to save her from a man whom he believes to be a source of danger to her. He sends her money every quarter, which, as you know, we have never touched--it stands in her name if ever she should require it. Grooten is a man into whose charge we could not possibly give her, and yet of all these people he is the only one whom I would trust--the only one whom I feel instinctively means well by her. Madame Richard wants her, Lady Delahaye wants her, and behind them both there is the Archduchess, who also wants her. I have thought this matter over, and, so far as I am concerned, I have decided----" ...|$|E
