60|$|As to that Fugitive Slave Law, {{it should}} be {{explained}} that the grievance has not arisen {{from the loss of}} slaves. I have heard it stated that South Carolina, up to the time of the secession, had never lost a slave in this way--that is, by Northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law; and that the total number of slaves escaping successfully into the Northern States, and there remaining through the <b>non-operation</b> of this law, did not amount to five in the year. It has not been a question of property, but of feeling. It has been a political point; and the South has conceived--and probably conceived truly--that this resolution on the part of Northern States to defy the law with reference to slaves, even though in itself it might not be immediately injurious to Southern property, was an insertion of the narrow end of the wedge. It was an action taken against slavery--an action taken by men of the North against their fellow-countrymen in the South. Under such circumstances, the sooner such countrymen should cease to be their fellows the better it would be for them. That, I take it, was the argument of the South, or at any rate that was its feeling.|$|E

Zeal320 operated Air New Zealand's trans-Tasman fleet of Airbus A320-200 aircraft under the Air New Zealand brand. On 31 July 2006, flights were re-numbered to the NZ700-999 series for trans-Tasman services, and NZ1000 series for domestic services. All of Air New Zealand's A320-200s were registered to Zeal320 until 26 November 2008, when ownership of the fleet was transferred back to Air New Zealand. However, staff that worked the A320-200 fleet were still employed by this subsidiary. This {{was a source of}} contention within the airline group in which these employees were paid at a lower scale than their mainline counterparts. Continued industrial action by staff employed in this subsidiary during 2009 permanently delayed a proposed low-cost carrier airline as a successor to Freedom Air that would have also employed the Airbus A320 on domestic routes to counter Jetstar Airways, also operating in New Zealand. As of mid-2014, a <b>non-operations</b> company named Zeal320 is registered as active with the New Zealand Companies Office, but this entity does not employ any crew.|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Patient {{experience}} {{data are}} often {{reported at the}} provider level rather than the patient level, meaning that providers receive an aggregate score of all patient experience scores across their service. This inflates positivity and {{makes it difficult for}} providers to use patient experience scores to tailor improvements for patients within specific sites, wards or pathways. Patients have different priorities for their urological cancer care experience, and improvement programmes should take these differences into account. A more granular understanding of different patterns of patient experience will allow health care providers to focus their improvement strategies differently based on the needs of the patient groups that utilise their services. Objective: This study examines what groups exist within the urological cancer patient population, and what are their respective priorities for patient experience improvement. Methods: Using urological cancers as a case study, this paper uses data from the UK National Cancer Patient Experience Survey to segment the patient population based on their scores for 14 domains of experience. TwoStep cluster analyses were carried out on two groups of survey respondents: those who had an operation and those who did not. These analyses identified previously unknown clusters within the two populations. Profiles were created for each cluster based on a series of demographic variables, and a regression analysis was conducted to assess the significance of each demographic variable in determining cluster membership. Results: The TwoStep analysis yielded three clusters for both the operations and <b>non-operations</b> groups based on how patients experienced care: Positive, Middling and Negative. Gender, age, cancer type and income significantly influenced cluster membership: women, younger and more deprived patients were more prevalent in the Negative experience cluster. Conclusion: This more nuanced understanding of the patient population and the variation in their priorities for patient experience improvement is the first step to more patient-centric improvement. It will allow services to make more meaningful and individualised changes based on the voices of patients. This is a proof of concept that can be applied broadly in health care to more effectively deliver on the patient-centred agenda...|$|R

50|$|However, {{thanks to}} the delayed neutrons, it is {{possible}} to leave the reactor in a subcritical state as far as only prompt neutrons are concerned: the delayed neutrons come a moment later, just in time to sustain the chain reaction when it is going to die out. In that regime, neutron production overall still grows exponentially, but on a time scale that is governed by the delayed neutron production, which is slow enough to be controlled (just as an otherwise unstable bicycle can be balanced because human reflexes are quick enough on the time scale of its instability). Thus, by widening the margins of <b>non-operation</b> and supercriticality and allowing more time to regulate the reactor, the delayed neutrons are essential to inherent reactor safety and even in reactors requiring active control.|$|E

40|$|Conference Theme: Building capapcity of a tobacco-free worldPoster Session: 102 - 340 BACKGROUND: Despite the {{effectiveness}} of smoking cessation interventions provided in the community, most youngsters would not seek assistance even {{if they want to}} quit. OBJECTIVE: To examine strategies which facilitate youth smokers to use telephone-based smoking cessation counseling. METHODS: A youth quitline was piloted in Hong Kong which targets to help youngsters aged 12 to 25 to quit smoking. Publicity strategies including press conference, newspaper articles, website, and distribution of publicity items to schools and community centers were applied to promote the quitline. The quitline operated from 4 – 10 pm per day, with an additional 1 – 4 pm session during Saturdays. Any calls during <b>non-operation</b> hours were recorded and handled by counselors in the next day. RESULTS: The project is ongoing. During the first 3 months, 407 calls were received, of which 185 calls were relevant and about two-fifths came from youth smokers. Most youth smokers obtained the quitline from the mass media (56 %), parents and friends (16 %), and through internet (15 %). Moreover, 30 % of relevant calls came from non-smokers who want to help teenagers quit smoking. Of 268 calls received during the <b>non-operation</b> hours, 27 % were retrieved successfully. CONCLUSION: While the mass media is the most effective means to promote Youth Quitline, youth smokers could be motivated to utilize the service from their family members and friends.

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the clinicopathologic findings of an endoscopic polypectomy for malignant polyps with subsequent surgery and to evaluate the appropriateness of the pathologic finding criterion of the resection margin as an indicator for surgery in cases of malignant colorectal polyps. Methods: We examined the clinicopathologic characteristics, complications and prognoses among the patients who underwent a colonoscopic polypectomy in both our hospitals and at other hospitals from April 2003 and April 2010. These patients were divided into two groups, the group (<b>non-operation</b> group) that only underwent a polypectomy (n = 37) and the group (operation group) that underwent a polypectomy with subsequent surgery (n = 33). Results: There were no differences between two groups in the ratios of the number of men to the number of women, the ages or the comorbidities. In terms of endoscopic findings, we found no {{differences between the two groups}} in the locations of the polyps, the sizes of the polyps, or the presence of stalks. However, ulceration of polyps was higher in the nonoperation group (51. 5 % vs. 21. 6 %; P = 0. 009), as was the case with submucosal invasion (75. 8 % vs. 16. 2 %; P < 0. 005). When an endoscopic polypectomy was performed, incomplete resection margins and specimens with margins involved occurred more frequently in the operation group (93. 9 % vs. 51. 4 %; P < 0. 005), but no residual tumor was detected in 31 of 33 (93. 9 %) patients in that group.

40|$|Abstract – To avoid {{undesirable}} disconnection {{of healthy}} wind generators (WGs) or a wind power plant, a WG protection relay should discriminate among faults, {{so that it}} can operate instantaneously for WG, connected feeder or connection bus faults, it can operate after a delay for inter-tie or grid faults, and it can avoid operating for parallel WG or adjacent feeder faults. A WG protection relay based on the positive- and negative-sequence fault components is proposed in the paper. At stage 1, the proposed relay uses the magnitude of the positive-sequence component in the fault current to distinguish faults requiring <b>non-operation</b> response from those requiring instantaneous or delayed operation responses. At stage 2, the fault type is first determined using the relationships between the positive- and negative-sequence fault components. Then, the relay differentiates between instantaneous operation and delayed operation based on the magnitude of the positive-sequence fault component. Various fault scenarios involving changes in position and type of fault and faulted phases are used to verify the performance of the relay. This paper concludes by implementing the relay on a hardware platform based on a digital signal processor. Results indicate that the relay can successfully distinguish the need for instantaneous, delayed, or <b>non-operation...</b>|$|E

Therefore, anastomosis was performed {{in a total of}} 23 sides. The postoperative clinical course was observed for more than 5 years after the STA-MCA anastomosis. Cerebral hemorrhage occurred after operation in 2 sides (8. 7 %) among the 23 sides that received STAMCA anastomosis. On the contrary, hemorrhage occurred during conservative therapy in 5 sides (13. 5 %) among 37 <b>non-operation</b> sides (no significance in χ 2 test).
