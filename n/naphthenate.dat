The use of fuel {{additive}} {{has been proposed}} as a cost-effective strategy for leading to improvement in the fuel efficiency and reduction in the emissions from diesel-powered engines.

The role of the light, intermediate, and heavy amphiphiles present in the crude oil on its emulsifying properties has been discussed by comparing the emulsion type and stability diagrams obtained for the different oil phases. It has been found that the type of emulsion is governed by the acidic amphiphiles contained in the intermediate fraction.

40|$|When first {{received}} by a refinery, the crude oil usually contains some water, mineral salts, and sediments. The salt appears in different forms, most often times it is dissolved {{in the formation}} water {{that comes with the}} crude i. e. in brine form, but it could also be present as solid crystals, water-insoluble particles of corrosion products or scale and metal-organic compounds such as prophyrins and <b>naphthenates.</b> The amount of salt in the crude can vary typically between 5 to 200 PTB depending on the crude source, API, viscosity and other properties of the crude. For the following reasons, it is of utmost importance {{to reduce the amount of}} salt in the crude before processing the crude in the Crude Distillation Unit and consequently downstream processing units of a refinery. 1. Salt causes corrosion in the equipment. 2. Salt fouls inside the equipment. The fouling problem not only negatively impacts the heat transfer rates in the exchangers and furnace tubes but also affects the hydraulics of the system by increasing the pressure drops and hence requiring more pumping power to the system. Salt also plugs the fractionator trays and causes reduced mass transfer i. e. reduced separation efficiency and therefore need for increased re-boiler/condenser duties. 3. The salt in the crude usually has a source of metallic compounds, which could cause poisoning of catalyst in hydrotreating and other refinery units. Until a few years ago, salt concentrations as high as 10 PTB (1 PTB = 1 lb salt per 1000 bbl crude) was acceptable for desalted crude; However, most of the refineries have adopted more stringent measures for salt content and recent specs only allow 1 PTB in the desalted crude. This would require many existing refineries to improve their desalting units to achieve the tighter salt spec. This study will focus on optimizing the salt removal efficiency of a desalting unit which currently has an existing single-stage desalter. By adding a second stage desalter, the required salt spec in the desalted crude will be met.

In this thesis, four related aspects of <b>naphthenate</b> deposits are studied, as follows: (i) Characterization of various field naphthenates samples from different parts of the world, involving naphthenic acid extraction method development and subsequent extract analysis using electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (APCI MS) techniques. It was observed that different naphthenic acid extraction and analysis methods affected the naphthenic acid identification and apparent composition; (ii) Geochemical studies have been carried out on various crude oils which form calcium <b>naphthenate</b> deposits, sodium carboxylate soaps and emulsions. Biomarker correlation analysis was employed on the aliphatic and aromatic fractions of the crude oil samples using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS); (iii) Thermodynamic modelling of <b>naphthenate</b> formation was carried out, and both a simple thermodynamic pH change <b>naphthenate</b> model and a full <b>naphthenate</b> precipitation model have been developed.

The program is funded by Statoil and conducted in close collaboration with The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. The goal of the main project is to establish new methods for both preventing formation and facilitating removal of the NA. The newly developed methods will be based on the application of functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (FMN) for extraction of NA before formation of the metal <b>naphthenates</b> as well as their removal. Commercial magnetic particles with silica cover (SiO 2 -MAG) were purchased, which could be used just as they are or be directly functionalized. The particles were characterized by digital video microscopy (DVM) to estimate the size of the particles. The diameter was found to be 3, 3 μm, and a specific surface area calculated to be 1, 4 m 2 /g. This area was too small for NA adsorption. Therefore, synthesis of new nanoparticles was required. Fe 3 O 4 MNP were obtained by co-precipitation, and coated with silica via a sol-gel approach. The synthesized MNP had magnetic properties, and were attracted when a magnetic field was applied. They were then characterized by gas adsorption analysis, which enabled the calculation of the specific surface area. The Fe 3 O 4 MNP and Fe 3 O 4 /SiO 2 MNP had a large specific surface area of approximately 100 m 2 /g, and the silica covered MNP were used for NA adsorption in octane. The size of the Fe 3 O 4 MNP was estimated to be 12 nm by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the analysis also confirmed a crystalline structure matching the theoretical Fe 3 O 4 structure. 4 -heptylbenzoic acid was used as a model NA and octane was used as model oil for adsorption experiments.

They are non-toxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible, making them ideal candidates for creating green materials for biological applications. In this thesis, we cover the synthesis of two novel materials from the biopolymers, chitosan and pectin. Chitosan is a biocompatible antibacterial polycation and pectin is an anti-inflammatory polyanion with a strong propensity for hydrogen-bonding. The two chitosan:pectin materials, particles and hydrogels, explore some of the structures that can be created by tuning the electrostatic interactions between chitosan and pectin. Chitosan can spontaneously form polyelectrolyte complexes when mixed with a polyanion in appropriate aqueous conditions. In the first study, chitosan:pectin nanoparticles were synthesized using an aqueous spontaneous ionic gelation method. A number of parameters, polymer concentration, addition order, mass ratio, and solution pH, were then explored and their effect on nanoparticle formation was determined. The synthesis of chitosan:pectin hydrogels have previously been limited by harsh acidic synthesis conditions, which restricted their use in biomedical applications. In the second study, a zero-acid hydrogel has been synthesized from a mixture of chitosan and pectin at biologically compatible conditions. We demonstrated that salt could be used to suppress long-range electrostatic interactions to generate a thermoreversible biopolymer hydrogel that has temperaturesensitive gelation. We then characterized the hydrogel system’s suitability for use as a wound dressing. iv An additional theme throughout this work includes using shear rheology as a powerful characterization tool to improve synthesized systems and collect important structural data for the creation of synthetic analogs. An electrospun emulsion system was tuned to maximize the amount of oil that could be spun into defect-free chitosan-based fibers. The Young’s modulus and complex viscosity of porcine bone marrow, porcine lung, porcine brain, and muscine brain were determined to enable the development of hydrogels that mimic these characteristics. We also explored the effects of using antifouling dopamine as a crosslinking agent for a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel system. Finally, with the goal of returning to green syntheses, we produced a simple selfassembling system for adding antibacterial activity to alkyd paints. Divalent metal <b>naphthenates</b> were used to catalyze oxidative crosslinking that form entrained metal nanoparticles as a byproduct. Overall, we have used a combination of rheology, knowledge of biopolymer interactions, and a desire to make syntheses cheaper and less hazardous to create an array of green biopolymer materials that are tailored for biological applications...|$|R
