5|$|Waste {{management}} is handled by Angus Council. There is a kerbside recycling scheme {{that has been}} in operation since May 2004. Cans, glass, paper and plastic bottles are collected on a weekly basis. Compostable material and <b>non-recyclable</b> material are collected on alternate weeks. Roughly two thirds of <b>non-recyclable</b> material is sent to landfill at Angus Council's site at Lochhead, Forfar and the remainder sent for incineration (with energy recovery) outside the council area.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{recovery}} from waste is {{the conversion of}} <b>non-recyclable</b> waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel {{through a variety of}} processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and landfill gas recovery. This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy {{recovery from}} waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert <b>non-recyclable</b> waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills. Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} actions along the {{recycling}} supply chain that can influence and affect the material quality of recyclate. It {{begins with the}} waste producers who place non-target and <b>non-recyclable</b> wastes in recycling collection. This can {{affect the quality of}} final recyclate streams or require further efforts to discard those materials at later stages in the recycling process. The different collection systems can result in different levels of contamination. Depending on which materials are collected together, extra effort is required to sort this material back into separate streams and can significantly reduce the quality of the final product. Transportation and the compaction of materials can {{make it more difficult to}} separate material back into separate waste streams. Sorting facilities are not one hundred per cent effective in separating materials, despite improvements in technology and quality recyclate which can see a loss in recyclate quality. The storage of materials outside where the product can become wet can cause problems for re-processors. Reprocessing facilities may require further sorting steps to further reduce the amount of non-target and <b>non-recyclable</b> material. Each action along the recycling path plays a part in the quality of recyclate.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Suppose a {{municipality}} optimally locates two recycling/sorting {{centers to}} minimize {{the sum of the}} transportation costs from i) households to the recycling centers and ii) recycling centers to the landfill. Assume that all household waste is taken to a recycling center, sorted, and the <b>non-recyclables</b> are subsequently transported to the landfill. The landfill location and the proportion of waste recycled are exogenous. The paper shows that the location of the recycling centers is chosen to equalize the marginal costs of the two transportation stages, unless an endpoint condition obtains, in which case one recycling center is located at the landfill. (R 1 : General Spatial Economics, H 7 : Publicly Provided Goods) This paper considers the locational aspects of the optimal design of a municipal waste management program with two recycling centers and a single existing landfill. As transportation costs are {{a significant part of the}} overall waste management costs, the paper will suppose that the locations of the recycling centers are chosen to minimize transportation costs. Specifically, it is assumed that all household waste is collected and taken to a recycling center where the recyclables are separated from the <b>non-recyclables...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{considers}} a municipality {{that has a}} landfill (fixed in location) and plans to optimally locate a “recycling center ” {{in order to minimize}} transportation costs. The transportation problem consists of two stages: the first stage is the transportation of waste from the households to the recycling center. Households are distributed (not necessarily uniformly) over the two-dimensional city. The second stage is the transportation of the <b>non-recyclables</b> from the recycling center to the landfill. A precise description of the optimal location of the recycling center is found which depends on the density function, the proportion of waste recycled, and the location of the landfill. JEL: R 1. Recycling has {{become a part of the}} waste management plans of many municipalities in the United States in the last ten years. While the exact configuration of these plans vary, transportation is always a major cost component, as indeed it is for waste management in general. The present paper {{considers a}} municipality which has a landfill (fixed in location) and plans to optimally locate a “recycling center. ” It is supposed that all waste generated by households is transported first to the recycling center, where the recyclables are sorted from the <b>non-recyclables.</b> The recyclables are taken away by a commercial recycler (and thus involve n...|$|R
25|$|Porto Alegre {{was one of}} {{the first}} cities in Brazil to develop a {{recycling}} program and has been acknowledged as having the best management practices in the country. The city produces about 1,600 tonnes of household waste per day. Since 1997, all <b>non-recyclable</b> waste has been disposed of in landfill sites. Infiltration into the soil is prevented by the double-walled construction of a clay layer and a high-density polythene geo-membrane, the lowering of the water table and the draining off and treatment of any effluent.|$|E

In January 1999, Elections Canada lost the tape. A report about the investigation stated that [...] "the tape had been deposited inadvertently into Elections Canada's <b>non-recyclable</b> waste"; before the investigation, there had been concern that the tape and its data had been stolen. It resulted in separate investigations by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada George Radwanski, the Office of the Manitoba Ombudsman, and an audit commissioned by Elections Canada conducted by a private security firm.

2500|$|The {{quality of}} recyclates is {{recognized}} as one of the principal challenges that needs to be addressed for the success of a long-term vision of a green economy and achieving zero waste. Recyclate quality is generally referring to how much of the raw material is made up of target material compared to the amount of non-target material and other <b>non-recyclable</b> material. Only target material is likely to be recycled, so a higher amount of non-target and <b>non-recyclable</b> material will reduce the quantity of recycling product. A high proportion of non-target and <b>non-recyclable</b> material can make it more difficult for re-processors to achieve [...] "high-quality" [...] recycling. If the recyclate is of poor quality, it is more likely to end up being down-cycled or, in more extreme cases, sent to other recovery options or landfilled. For example, to facilitate the re-manufacturing of clear glass products there are tight restrictions for colored glass going into the re-melt process.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of waste {{disposal}} service fees and household characteristics in determining recycling rates and waste generation. Using individual household data from Portland, Oregon, we model a multistage household decision process regarding waste generation and recycling effort under a block pricing system, including the choice of container size and reduced-form demand equations for recyclables, <b>non-recyclables,</b> and recycling rate. The choice of container size is not affected by the price of waste disposal services, but within a given container size, households respond to a price increase by increasing recycling to avoid charges for waste generation above contracted volumes. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of the YES project, which is an example of {{community}} participation in SWM, the study shows that each participating household is encouraged to separate both recyclables (either organic, plastics, metals) and <b>non-recyclables.</b> Generally, some of the recyclables (plastics, WEEE, and metals) are sold directly at the household level to prospective itinerant waste buyers who roam the community on daily basis, while the mixed waste and organic materials are collected by the trained community waste pickers for a fee. These service providers haul waste from registered household sources to the composting facility. This is effectively carried out by pre-collection services using the tricycles acquired through the YES project.|$|R

"Electronic waste" [...] or [...] "E-Waste" [...] may {{be defined}} as {{discarded}} computers, office electronic equipment, entertainment device electronics, mobile phones, television sets, and refrigerators.

2500|$|Kovel {{notes that}} [...] "events in nature are {{reciprocal}} and multi-determined" [...] and can therefore not be predictably [...] "fixed"; socially, technologies cannot solve social problems {{because they are}} not [...] "mechanical". He posits an analysis, developed from Marx, that patterns of production and social organisation are more important then the forms of technology used within a given configuration of society.

In the modern world, Kovel considers the supposed efficiency of new post-industrial commodities is a [...] "plain illusion", as miniaturized components involve many substances and are therefore <b>non-recyclable</b> (and, theoretically, only simple substances could be retrieved by burning out-of-date equipment, releasing more pollutants). He is quick to warn [...] "environmental liberals" [...] against over-selling the virtues of renewable energies that cannot meet the mass energy consumption of the era; although he would still support renewable energy projects, he believes it is more important to restructure societies to reduce energy use before relying on renewable energy technologies alone.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess food service environmental and food safety management systems according to two checklists based on ABNT ISO 22000 and 14001. METHODS: This exploratory and descriptive study investigated a-la-carte food services of the Federal District, Brazil. Two checklists were developed to investigate ISO 14001 and 22000 compliance. A total of 37 food services were selected from the list of the Brazilian Association of Bars and Restaurants by simple random sampling. Checklist results were analyzed according to ANVISA resolution nº 275 / 2002. RESULTS: Only five food services employed dietitians to supervise meal production. These establishments achieved the highest ISO compliance. However, no establishment had more than 50 % ISO 14001 or 22000 compliance. Restaurants showed little concern for the environment and disobeyed waste disposal laws by not separating recyclables from <b>non-recyclables.</b> CONCLUSION: The study food services do not have safe meal production systems, evidenced by non-conformity with the reference standards. Additionally, they do not attempt to reduce the environmental impact of their wastes. Food services supervised by dietitians are better prepared to produce safe foods...|$|R

In this context, a green building could be defined as one, which has been designed, constructed and operated, ensuring, minimal adverse impact on the environment. Most modern green buildings are able to satisfy the term “green”, in respect of construction materials, construction technologies, energy efficient building operations and maintenance procedures.
