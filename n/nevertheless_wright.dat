2500|$|Built in 1909 of {{wood and}} stucco the Gardener's Cottage is so modest in size that a boxy {{configuration}} {{appears to have been}} inevitable, contrary to Wright's ideal of opening up the confining [...] "box" [...] of traditional American houses. <b>Nevertheless,</b> <b>Wright</b> managed to create an illusion of the pier and cantilever principle that characterized the Martin House by placing tall rectangular panels at each corner of the building. The gardener was Reuben Polder who had to provide fresh flowers daily for every room in the Martin House, a task which he completed until Darwin Martin died in 1935.|$|E
500|$|Aside from Harrison, {{the musicians}} on the {{recording}} include Nicky Hopkins (piano), Klaus Voormann (bass) and Jim Keltner (drums). As {{can be heard}} in the outtake of [...] "Who Can See It" [...] available unofficially on the Living in the Alternate World bootleg, Gary Wright's original contribution was a prominent harmonium part, superseded by Barham's strings and brass on the released version. Leng <b>nevertheless</b> credits <b>Wright</b> with playing organ on the song.|$|R
2500|$|As governor, <b>Wright</b> <b>nevertheless</b> {{signed the}} arrest warrant for Methodist {{minister}} for Calvin Fairbank, who helped slaves escape from Kentucky on the Underground Railroad. [...] As {{a result of}} Wright's signature, Fairbank was kidnapped by Kentuckians in Jeffersonville, Indiana in 1851, dragged to Kentucky for trial, and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. [...] Fairbank reportedly received over 30,000 lashes in jail until he was pardoned in 1864.|$|R
50|$|Toole {{began to}} be troubled by gout in 1886. After his {{daughter}} died in 1888, followed by his wife in 1889, Toole was disconsolate, and his health deteriorated further. By this time, his acting was unfashionable: he {{began to be}} seen as the last of the line of old-fashioned low comic actors who had been popular earlier in the century, including Buckstone, John Liston and Edward Richard <b>Wright.</b> <b>Nevertheless,</b> he toured Australia and New Zealand in 1890. He published his reminiscences in 1888, and his stage appearances gradually became fewer. The gout left him sometimes unable to walk, and after an 1893 illness during Thoroughbred by Ralph Lumley, he retired from the London stage, although he made occasional appearances in the provinces until about 1896. His theatre was demolished in 1895 for an extension of Charing Cross Hospital, and he dissolved his theatre company after an 1896 tour.|$|R
5000|$|Reviewing the New York City premiere, Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times lauded the piece, {{calling it}} a [...] "restive, cosmic and formidably {{difficult}} new Cello Concerto." [...] David Wright of the New York Classical Review was more critical of the work, however, remarking, [...] "...at its New York unveiling, Salonen's new Cello Concerto, with Ma as soloist and the New York Philharmonic led by Alan Gilbert, seemed a work longer on novelty than expressionâ€”hardly what one would expect, given the famously passionate and ebullient performer it was composed for." [...] <b>Wright</b> <b>nevertheless</b> added, [...] "Whatever his objectives in a piece, the conductor-composer Salonen {{can be counted on}} to write for orchestra with exceptional imagination. This concerto continually surprised and delighted the ear with fresh sounds, from the chugging, twinkling orchestral 'chaos' of the opening pages (reminiscent of the concert's opening piece, John Adams's The Chairman Dances) to the third movement's cello-conga duet between Ma and the Philharmonic's principal percussionist Christopher S. Lamb." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Wrights {{tested the}} new {{aircraft}} at Huffman Prairie, a cow pasture outside of Dayton, Ohio, {{which is now}} part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park and also part of the present-day Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The owner of the land, banker Torrance Huffman, allowed them to use the land rent-free, his only requirement being that they were to shepherd the livestock to safety before experimenting. The Wrights began erecting a shed to house their aircraft during April {{and by the end of}} May were ready to begin trials, and an announcement was made to the press that trials would begin on Monday, May 23. A crowd of around forty people, made up of family and friends and a dozen reporters, assembled on the Monday but rain kept the aircraft in its shed all morning, and when the rain cleared the wind had died away. There was little chance of a successful takeoff from the 100 ft launching rail with no headwind: <b>nevertheless</b> the <b>Wright</b> decided to attempt a short flight to satisfy the press, but the motor was not developing its full power and the aircraft reached the end of the rail without taking off. Work on the engine and poor weather delayed further attempts until the Thursday afternoon, when despite ignition problems a takeoff was attempted, and a flight of around 25 ft was made, ending in a heavy landing which damaged the aircraft. The press reports were mixed, the Chicago Tribune ran its story under the headline [...] "Test of flying machine is judged a success", while The New York Times headline was [...] "Fall wrecks airship".|$|R
5000|$|In {{his second}} season at Scunthorpe United, Wright started his season when he scored his first goal for the club in a Football League Cup game against Manchester United on 22 September 2010. After the match, Wright says he is more than please to score his first goal because he cited as a [...] "long time coming". Wright started well for the club until his playing time minutes {{significantly}} decreased later in the season. In the January transfer window, Wright requested a transfer, during in which, he was offered a new contract and prepared for his exit from Scunthorpe United. This came after Reading were keen to sign him and was keen to move down to the south. However, his father stated that Wright will unlikely to the club in the January transfer window, but will leave in the summer. After failed transfer move in January transfer window, Wright expected {{to be back in}} the first team and earn playing time, as well as, withdrawing his transfer request. Unfortunately, his loss of form and a foot injury that kept him for the rest of 2010-11 season cost his first team place. Despite loss of form costing his first team place, <b>Wright,</b> <b>nevertheless,</b> made thirty-six appearance for the club.|$|R
5000|$|Judith [...] "Denny" [...] Denham: Ernest Wrights' {{secretary}} and Nancy Wrights' four-hand partner at {{playing the piano}} - secretly wants {{to be part of}} the Wright family. Although she describes herself as being [...] "fat" [...] and not at all beautiful, she never has any problems attracting men and has already had several affairs with married men. So, too, with Ernest <b>Wright.</b> <b>Nevertheless,</b> she comes over every Saturday to play the piano with Nancy, but in fact, she wants more. Despite Denny always claims that she does not want to marry as it is sufficient for her to have affairs with various married men, she collects every issue of [...] "Modern Bride".In the end, everything turns out well for Denny. She marries Ben Wright and therefore becomes part of the Wright family and even inherits the Wrights' house - which she has secretly longed for. Her inner wish to become a part of the Wright family, is quite understandable since she has never had a chance to experience a real family life: her father ran away and her mother died. This circumstance also explains why she so readily accepts Nancy's way of treating her, which is more like that of a mother than a friend.|$|R
