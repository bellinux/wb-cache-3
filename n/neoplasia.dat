40|$|Vulvar cancer {{represents}} an important medical problem worldwide whose incidence is increasing {{at an alarming}} rate in young females. Several factors have been linked to vulvar cancer development, but its exact pathogenesis remains to be determined. Vulvar tumorigenesis proceeds through intermediate dysplastic lesions, known as vulvar intraepithelial <b>neoplasias,</b> frequently associated with non-neoplastic epithelial disorders of the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus and squamous cell hyperplasia. In this study, the expression of the CDK inhibitor p 27 (Kip 1) and the extent of endogenous oxidative DNA damage were evaluated in vulvar specimens, including normal tissues, lichen sclerosus, squamous cell hyperplasia, vulvar intraepithelial <b>neoplasias</b> and invasive squamous cell carcinomas. We found that p 27 (Kip 1) was constantly expressed in normal vulvar epithelium cells while a progressive significant reduction in the percentage of p 27 (Kip 1) -positive cells was observed in vulvar intraepithelial <b>neoplasias</b> (77 %) and in invasive carcinomas (64 %). Mean percentage of positive cells in invasive carcinomas, but not in vulvar intraepithelial <b>neoplasias,</b> was also significantly lower than squamous cell hyperplasia lesions (78 %) while lichen sclerosus displayed a percentage of positive cells (45 %) significantly lower than both vulvar intraepithelial <b>neoplasias</b> and invasive carcinomas. 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) is considered a sensitive biomarker for oxidative stress. We observed a progressive significant increase in the levels of 8 -OHdG and in the percentage of positive cells from normal vulvar epithelium to vulvar intraepithelial <b>neoplasias</b> (25 %) and to invasive carcinomas (64 %). Squamous cell hyperplasia displayed an intermediate percentage of positive cells comparable to vulvar intraepithelial <b>neoplasias</b> 2 but significantly higher than vulvar intraepithelial <b>neoplasias</b> 1 and lower than invasive carcinomas. Lichen sclerosus staining was significantly lower than carcinomas but higher than vulvar intraepithelial <b>neoplasias</b> and squamous cell hyperplasia. These results demonstrate that expression of p 27 (Kip 1) is downregulated while oxidative DNA damage increases from early non-neoplastic epithelial alterations through vulvar intraepithelial <b>neoplasias</b> to invasive vulvar carcinomas. Thus, both parameters might {{play an important role in}} the development of this cancer and their study might contribute to our understanding of human vulvar carcinogenesis. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Development of an endometrial {{hyperplasia}} (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is {{a significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without {{the presence of a}} hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial <b>neoplasia.</b> Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{extent of}} {{association}} of human papilloma virus (HPV) in human conjunctival <b>neoplasias</b> has been debated in studies originating from {{different parts of}} the world, but no substantial evidence has been generated on Indian subjects. This prompted us to carry out a retrospective study on conjunctival <b>neoplasias</b> diagnosed over the past 12 years. Materials and Methods: Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of 65 specimens of ocular <b>neoplasias</b> and 30 normal controls diagnosed between 1991 and 2002 at a tertiary eye care hospital, was undertaken. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were reviewed for confirming histopathological diagnosis, presence of koilocytosis and changes related to actinic keratosis. Immunohistochemical analysis was done using HPV-specific monoclonal antibodies. Clinicopathological correlation and the association of HPV antigen with the histopathological features were performed. Results: Out of the 65 cases analyzed, 35 were papillomas and 30 were ocular surface squamous <b>neoplasias</b> (OSSN). The mean age was 48 years with a male preponderance. Histologically, koilocytosis was observed in 17. 1 &#x 0025; of papillomas and 36. 6 &#x 0025; of OSSN. Actinic keratosis was present in 33 &#x 0025; of OSSN. Immunohistochemically 17. 1 &#x 0025; conjunctival papillomas stained positive for HPV antigen, all cases of OSSN were negative for HPV. There was no correlation between koilocytosis or actinic keratosis and the detection of HPV antigen. Conclusions: The association between HPV and conjunctival <b>neoplasias</b> is variable in different geographical areas and also depends on the methods of detection used.

40|$|Considering {{that there}} are some studies with autopsies from AIDS {{describing}} only malignant <b>neoplasias</b> and that changes can occur after the introduction of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), our objectives were to analyze the frequency of benign and malignant neoplasms in AIDS patients in the periods of both pre- and post-HAART. This is a retrospective study with 261 autopsies of HIV-positive patients between 1989 and 2008 in Uberaba, Brazil. Sixty-six neoplasms were found (39 benign, 21 malignant and six premalignant) in 58 patients. The most frequent malignant neoplasms were lymphoid, in 2. 7 % (four Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, one Hodgkin, one multiple myeloma and one plasmablastic plasmacytoma), and Kaposi's Sarcoma, in 2. 3 % (six cases). The most frequent benign neoplasms were hepatic hemangiomas in 11 (4. 2 %) of 261 cases and uterine leiomyoma in 11 (15. 7 %) of 70 woman. In the pre-HAART period eight (9. 8 %) benign <b>neoplasias</b> and four (4. 9 %) malignant occurred in 82 patients; in the post-HAART period, 29 (16. 2 %) benign and 17 (9. 5 %) malignant were present; however, the differences were not significant. We conclude that the introduction of HAART in our region doesn't look to have modified the frequency of neoplasms occurring in patients with HIV.

Understanding the cellular origin of cancer {{can help to}} improve disease prevention and therapeutics. Human plasma cell <b>neoplasias</b> are thought to develop from either differentiated B cells or plasma cells. However, when the expression of Maf oncogenes (associated to human plasma cell <b>neoplasias)</b> is targeted to mouse B cells, the resulting animals fail to reproduce the human disease. Here, to explore early cellular changes that might {{take place in the}} development of plasma cell <b>neoplasias,</b> we engineered transgenic mice to express MafB in haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HS/PCs). Unexpectedly, we show that plasma cell <b>neoplasias</b> arise in the MafB-transgenic mice. Beyond their clinical resemblance to human disease, these <b>neoplasias</b> highly express genes that are known to be upregulated in human multiple myeloma. Moreover, gene expression profiling revealed that MafB-expressing HS/PCs were more similar to B cells and tumour plasma cells than to any other subset, including wild-type HS/PCs. Consistent with this, genome-scale DNA methylation profiling revealed that MafB imposes an epigenetic program in HS/PCs, and that this program is preserved in mature B cells of MafB-transgenic mice, demonstrating a novel molecular mechanism involved in tumour initiation. Our findings suggest that, mechanistically, the haematopoietic progenitor population can be the target for transformation in MafB-associated plasma cell <b>neoplasias.</b> © 2012 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.

In this research the histogenesis of neoplastic lesions found in bladder of bovines with enzootic hematuria from Caparaó microregion in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil was determined. To accomplish this objective, immunohistochemical analysis was performed with primary antibodies: anti-vimentin, anti-cytokeratin, anti-CD 31 and anti-uroplakin. Neoplasms found included urothelial carcinoma, in situ carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, hemangioma, myxoma e hemangiosarcoma. Immunohistochemical staining of cytokeratin in epithelial neoplasms and vimentin in mesenchymal neoplasms was significant (p 0. 05). Most neoplasms showed an atypical uroplakin staining on urothelium and, in the case of hemangiosarcomas there was no staining of the urothelium at all. The Spearman statistical analysis revealed a positive correlation (r= 0. 63, p= 0. 05) between CD 31 and vimentin and between cytokeratin and uroplakin (rs= – 0. 61, p= 0. 05). It was concluded that biomarkers anti-cytokeratin, anti-vimentin and anti-CD 31 are important for the diagnosis of neoplasms epithelial, mesenchymal and vascular mesenchymal, respectively. It is possible to use vimentin and CD 31 in association in vascular mesenchymal neoplasms and cytokeratin and uroplakin in epithelial neoplasms. The uroplakin is an effective marker, not only for tumor diagnosis, but also to evaluate the urothelial integrity.
