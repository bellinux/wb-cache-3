A year after the diagnosis of malignancy, she was seen in the local dermatology unit with a blistering eruption on her legs and oral mucosa, which was subsequently confirmed by skin biopsy and immunofluor-escence studies to be bullous pemphigoid. She developed muscle weakness due to myasthenia gravis 2 yrs later. There was no evidence of an associated thymoma. Both her muscle and skin disease were controlled with oral corticosteroids and azathioprine, along with pyridostigmine, for nearly 10 yrs. In April 2001, her skin disease was further evaluated because of persistent oral ulceration; a diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) was confirmed by presence of circulating antibodies to a variety of intra- and extracellular epidermal antigens, including bullous pemphigoid antigen (230 kD), envoplakin (210 kD) and periplakin (190 kD). Physical examination showed the presence of inspiratory crackles at lung bases; there was no cyanosis or clubbing. Serum autoantibodies were negative apart from those against skin.

40|$|<b>Non-Hodgkin</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphomas</b> {{have become}} more {{prevalent}} in the past 20 years. They constitute {{a diverse group of}} lymphoid tumors that have been understood and classified according to their clinical behaviour, anatomic location, morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and gene expression profile. Microarray profiling yields information about large number of genes, which can be involved in different functional pathways of importance for the biology of lymphomas. In this thesis, we started to look at major types of B-cell lymphomas by using the microarrays, with the aim to have a macroscopic view of the signaling pathways involved in their biology. Functional signatures such as cellcycle, apoptosis, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, T-cell receptor, B-cell receptor (BCR), cell adhesion, and NF-kappaB activation describe multiple dysregulated pathways in lymphomas. The BCR gene expression delineates distinct functional heterogeneity within each lymphoma. In CLL, the BCR genes were positively correlated to the expression of the pathways for CREB, MAPK/ERK 5, BCR Signaling and MET. In MCL, the BCR genes were additionally coregulated to GC T-helper cell, integrins, CXCR 4 and blood pan-B cell genes. In FL, BCR genes showed positive correlation to the mTOR-, GC B-cell-, Akt- and BCR Signaling-, blood pan B-cell- and ERK 5 - pathways while in DLBCL they were co-expressed with GC-B-cell, blood pan-B cell and c-myc targets. Interestingly, targets for BLIMP- 1, an important transcription factor, were positively correlated to the expression of BCR genes in all the four mentioned lymphomas (Paper I). During unsupervised clustering, we observed that BCR genes and TCL 1 oncogene were expressed in the same cluster. Variation in the level of gene array expression of TCL 1 A was significantly associated with gene signatures recognizing B-cell lymphoma biology, such as germinal center, BCR, NF-êB (and its target genes), death, MAP kinases, TNFR 1, TOLL, and IL 1 R. High expression of TCL 1 was related to poor prognosis in CLL and MCL in microarray and immunohistochemistry respectively. (Paper II). Thus, we found in these studies (Paper I and II) that BCR and TCL 1 are important to lymphoma biology, while they also define striking heterogeneity within known lymphoma types. The role of somatic hypermutation(SHM) of the B-cell receptor in the lymphoma biology was demonstrated (paperIII); we identified here surrogate markers or genes in the cell machinery that accompany the process. Markers of SHM (such as RAD 51 C and CDK 7) and ongoing SHM (TFDP 1 and POLA) are some of the genes involved in DNA repair and replication. CDK 7 and RCC 1, separately and together, showed prognostic value in Mantle Cell Lymphoma on immunohistochemistry (Paper III). In the end, we narrowed our attention to Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and the microenvironment. Using a uniqueapproach of flow cytometry and automated microscopy scoring in FL, we identified that the clinical outcome was independently predicted by different immune cells: CD 4 + T-cells and macrophages were associated with poorprognosis while cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and T-regulatory cells were associated with better prognosis (Paper IV). The results presented in the thesis provide insight and understanding of lymphoma biology that would facilitate discovery of markers of prognostic and hopefully therapeutic importance...|$|R

The main aim of this thesis was to develop and present a method to do dosimetric calculations on tumors in patients included in the study. Inhomogeneity of dose was investigated through dose rate maps and cumulative dose rate histograms. Method: Using imaging data from two SPECT/CT-sessions 4 and 7 days post-injection, activity in lesions was quantified. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were drawn by a nu- clear medicine specialist. VOIs were drawn with a margin around the imaged activity of the lesion, the novel VOISPECT -method. Cumulative activity was found through mono- exponential clearance of the activity. Patient specific masses from VOIs closely around the tumors were used. Absorbed dose was found by the proposed S-factor, S,resulting in mean dose to the tumors. The activity quantification method was verified through phantom measurements with hot spheres in attenuating material. The energy absorption factor was found using the dose calculation computer program OLINDA. Dose rate maps were generated {{through the use of}} convolution of activity distribution and a voxel s-value kernel retrieved from a database. Result: A total of 17 tumors in 6 patients grouped in three dose levels were ascribed a mean dose. Mean doses ranged from 86 to 794 cGy. Inter- and intra-patient differences were observed. The phantom experiment showed good accuracy, with relative errors in the order of 5 % compared to true activity. A constant factor S ̄ to calculate the cumulative energy was found sufficient as long as tumor volumes are in the range 1 mL to 300 mL. 16 dose rate maps and cumulative dose rate volume histograms were made, and D-values were found. Conclusion: The method presented was found to be successful in the calculation of mean tumor dose.

40|$|CONTEXT: Primary {{central nervous}} system lymphomas (PCNSL) are a rare {{subgroup}} of lymphomas generally associated with HIV and EBV. OBJECTIVE: To study ten autopsy cases of PCNSL, to describe the neuropathological findings, to characterize the phenotype of the neoplastic cells, to detect EBV in the lesion and to compare the findings with the clinical and laboratory data of the patients. METHOD: The clinical, histological and immunohistochemical data of ten cases of PCNSL, eight cases from patients with AIDS, identified among 265 autopsies of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Seven patients were males and the mean age was 40. 9 years. The most frequent symptomatology was focal neurologic deficit (70 %). Six patients presented with only one lesion. Histologically, densely cellular and polymorphous neoplasms with angiocentrism were observed, in 90 % of cases. An association with other diseases was observed in four cases. Most patients had diffuse large B cell <b>non-Hodgkin</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> EBV was detected by immunohistochemistry in only one case. The lack of detection of the virus might {{have been due to}} the long time of fixation of the brain which might have inactivate epitopes therefore compromising the testing. CONCLUSION: In the present series, PCNSL presented with focal symptoms, with unifocal or multifocal lesions, with a predominant B-cell CD 20 positive phenotype, rarely associated with EBV. CONTEXTO: Linfoma primário do sistema nervoso central (LP-SNC) é raro subgrupo de linfomas relacionado à AIDS, geralmente associado EBV. OBJETIVO: Identificar os achados clínico-patológicos dos pacientes com LP-SNC. MÉTODO: Foram analisados dados clínicos, histológicos e imuno-histoquímicos de dez necrópsias de LP-SNC, oito deles de pacientes com AIDS, identificados entre 265 autopsias destes. RESULTADOS: Sete pacientes foram masculinos e a idade média foi 40, 9 anos. A sintomatologia neurológica mais freqüente era focal (70 %). Seis exibiram lesão única. Histologicamente, eram neoplasias densamente celulares e polimorfas, com angiocentrismo em 90 % dos casos. Em quatro casos, houve associação com outras afecções. A maioria dos casos foi de linfoma não-Hodgkin difuso de grandes células B. A pesquisa para EBV foi positiva em um caso.

40|$|This thesis {{consider}} two exposures {{from the}} electromagnetic spectrum extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF MF) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. ELF MF are the lowest and UV radiation ranges among the highest frequencies of non-ionizing radiation. The exposure prevalence of these fields is high in the general population. Most people are exposed daily to either or both types and potential health effects are of great concern. The aim of the thesis was to study occupational exposure to ELF MF and UV radiation in relation to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases. A cohort with an increased prevalence of individuals highly exposed to ELF MF was created {{in order to be}} able to study exposure-response relations. In all, four cohort studies and one case-control study were performed. Exposure-response relationships were found for occupational ELF MF exposure and certain cancer diseases: malignant brain tumors among women, tumors of the pituitary gland among men. Welders were at an increased risk of tumors of the endocrine glands. The outcome might indicate an interaction with the hormonal system. A potential effect of occupational ELF MF exposure in cancer development cannot be rejected. In the study of neurodegenerative diseases, the risk of both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer s disease increased with increasing exposure to ELF MF. The results confirm previous findings of an association, and further epidemiological studies are needed, preferably based on morbidity data and taking into account potential confounding from e. g. electric shocks. For acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a low level increase in relative risk was found as well as an exposure-response relation. Joint occurrence of ELF MF exposure and a genetic susceptibility for AMI showed a synergistic effect on AMI mortality. Effect modification from e. g. genetic predisposition to the disease deserves to be further explored in studies of ELF MF and AMI. Swedish construction workers exposed to sunlight from outdoor work were at an increased risk of myeloid leukemia, lymphocytic leukemia or <b>non-Hodgkin</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and stomach cancer. These findings are possibly due to an effect of UV radiation on the immune system. Sunlight exposure was also associated with an increased risk of malignant melanoma of the eye. Extensive research has been carried out in relation to ELF MF. There is yet no evidence of any biological mechanisms that could explain how ELF MF might contribute to cause chronic diseases. Therefore, additional efforts to explore potential pathways are warranted. Also, the question of effect modification from individual sensitivity such as genetic predisposition and interactions with other environmental factors deserves to be further explored...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the association between endometriosis and malignancies also after controlling for parity, to investigate the impact of endometriosis on survival after a malignancy diagnosis and to investigate the association between treatment of endometriosis and ovarian cancer risk. In a population based cohort study on the association between endometriosis and malignancy, 64 492 women with a first time discharge diagnosis of endometriosis between 1969 and 2000, were included and 3 349 incident cases of a malignancy recorded. The total Swedish female population was used as control group and SIRs were used as estimates of relative risk (paper I). There were statistically significant increased risks for ovarian cancer (SIR 1. 43), endocrine tumors (SIR 1. 36), <b>non-Hodgkin</b> <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (SIR 1. 24) and brain tumors (SIR 1. 22). Endometriosis in the ovaries, younger age at endometriosis diagnosis and long-standing endometriosis were all factors contributing to an even higher risk for ovarian cancer. Women with endometriosis developed ovarian cancer earlier in life than other women and hysterectomy seemed to have a protective effect against ovarian cancer. The second population based cohort study included 63 630 women with a first time discharge diagnosis of endometriosis between 1969 and 2002 and who also had information on parity and age at first birth from the Multi Generation Register. The aim {{was to investigate the}} association between endometriosis and malignancy and control for parity. There were 3 822 incident cases of a malignancy recorded during follow up (paper II). The study showed a statistically significant increased risk of endocrine tumors (SIR 1. 38), ovarian cancer (SIR 1. 37), kidney cancer (SIR 1. 36), thyroid cancer (SIR 1. 33), brain tumors (SIR 1. 27), malignant melanoma (SIR 1. 23) and breast cancer (SIR 1. 08). There were no statistical difference in SIRs between nulliparous and parous women in any of the malignancies studied. The third study was a cohort study on the impact of endometriosis on survival after a malignancy diagnosis. The study included 4 278 women with endometriosis and a malignancy diagnosis (exposed women) and 41 831 women with a malignancy diagnosis only (unexposed women). The results showed a statistically significant improved survival for women with endometriosis for all malignancies combined (HR 0. 92), as well as for breast cancer (HR 0. 86) and for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer after the age of 54 (HR 0. 62). However, there was a worse prognosis after a diagnosis of malignant melanoma for women with endometriosis compared to other women (HR 1. 52). To study the impact of treatment of endometriosis and future ovarian cancer risk, medical records from 220 women with endometriosis and ovarian cancer (cases) and 416 controls were scrutinized (paper IV). The study showed strong reductions in risk for ovarian cancer after one-sided oophorectomy in both the univariate and multivariate analyses (OR 0. 42 and OR 0. 19, respectively) and when all visible endometriosis had been removed (OR 0. 37 and OR 0. 30, respectively). The only association between hormonal treatment and ovarian cancer was a borderline significance for months of danocrine use and ovarian cancer risk in the univariate analysis (OR 1. 06). This thesis shows that women with endometriosis have an increased risk of several types of malignancies, above all ovarian cancer. This increased risk is not related to parity. It is indicated that women with endometriosis have a better survival after a malignancy diagnosis than other women, especially for breast and ovarian cancer. However, the prognosis for malignant melanoma is worse for women with endometriosis. One-sided oophorectomy and removal of all visible endometriotic lesions strongly reduce the risk of ovarian cancer and the use of danocrine might be associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer...|$|E

40|$|Background:Fascin is an actin {{cross-linking}} protein, {{which is}} part of the cytoskeleton and involved in cell motility in several cell types. The differentiation of epithelial cells is greatly influenced by cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions, which play an important role in the normal organisation and stabilisation of epithelial cells and maintain the cells in a non-migratory state. The malignant conversion of epithelial cells results from a phenotypic switch to a migratory state, which allows tumour invasion beyond the basement membrane, as well as metastasis. Such a switch requires complex rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and is governed by multiple actin-binding proteins including fascin. In non-neoplastic lymphoid tissue, fascin expression is highly selective and is predominantly localised in dendritic cells, while lymphocytes, plasma cells, etc are uniformly non-reactive. However, all or nearly all Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants in all types of Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> express fascin and are strongly immunoreactive for fascin. Conclusion: Lymphomas (Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> and <b>non-Hodgkin</b> 2 ̆ 7 s) are among the commonest malignancies seen in our practice.

This leads to activation of caspase- 9, caspase- 3, and poly(ADP) -ribose polymerase cleavage leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis. In addition, curcumin treatment of Burkitt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cell lines also causes up-regulation of DR 5; however, this up-regulation does not result in apoptosis. Importantly, cotreatment with curcumin and TRAIL induces apoptosis in Bax-deficient cell lines. Taken together, {{our findings suggest that}} curcumin is able to induce apoptosis in Bax-positive cell lines, whereas combinations with TRAIL result in apoptosis in Bax-negative cell lines. These findings also raise the possibility that incorporation of curcumin in treatment regimens may provide a novel approach for the treatment of Burkitt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and provide the molecular basis for such future translational efforts...|$|R

40|$|The {{past ten}} years have seen a {{dramatic}} accumulation of insights into the biology, immunology and virology of EBV so {{that for the first}} time rational vaccine development can begin. Thus the targets molecules present on latency I, II and III diseases have been well defined and the relative importance of both the cellular and the humoral responses are understood at least in the broad sense. Several vaccine trials towards infectious mononucleosis (IM) and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) have been conducted and others are planned. While formulating vaccines for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (HL) are more speculative, there is good reason to believe that formulations encompassing cytotoxic T cell (CTL) epitopes encoded by LMP 1 and LMP 2 should have therapeutic benefit.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Strategies to {{circumvent}} or lessen the myelotoxicity associated with combination chemotherapy may improve the overall {{outcome of the}} management of patients particularly in resource poor settings. OBJECTIVES: To develop effective non-myelotoxic therapies for Burkitt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Lymphoma</b> (BL) and AIDS-related non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> DATA SOURCES: Publications, original and review articles, conference abstracts searched mainly on Pubmed indexed for medline. DATA EXTRACTION: A systematic review of the clinical problem of combination chemotherapy. Identification of clinical strategies that circumvent or lessen the myelotoxicity of combination cytotoxic chemotherapy. Length of survival, lack of clinically significant (3 ̆e grade 3) myelosuppression and weight loss were used as markers of myelotoxicity. DATA SYNTHESIS: Review of published experience {{with some of these}} strategies including dose-modification of multi-agent chemotherapy; rationale for targeted therapies, and the preclinical development of a mouse model exploring the role of metronomic scheduling substantiate pragmatism and feasibility of these approaches. CONCLUSION: Myelotoxic death rates using multi-agent induction chemotherapy approach 25...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of: Lin Y, Gustafson MP, Bulur PA, Gastineau DA, Witzig TE, Dietz AB: Immunosuppressive CD 14 (+) HLA-DRlow/- monocytes in B-cell non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Blood 117, 872 - 881 (2011). The {{mechanisms}} of systemic immunosuppression in B-cell non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (NHL) are poorly characterized. Lin and colleagues collected blood from 40 NHL patients prior to therapy. Monocytes from NHL patients suppressed T-cell proliferation, were unresponsive to Toll-like receptor stimulation by CpG and resistant to maturing into CD 83 (+) dendritic cells. This suppression was mediated {{in part through}} arginine metabolism, as exogenous arginine supplementation reversed this, and NHL patients had elevated arginase I in their plasma. These cells had decreased HLA-DR and TNF-alpha receptor II (CD 120 b) expression compared with controls. Patients with increased ratios of CD 14 (+) HLA-DRlow/- monocytes had more advanced disease and suppressed immune functions, indicating that CD 14 (+) HLA-DRlow/- monocytes are a pivotal and profoundly effective contributor to systemic immunosuppression in NHL...|$|R
