2500|$|Lend-Lease {{aid to the}} Soviet Union was <b>nominally</b> <b>managed</b> by Stettinius. Roosevelt's Soviet Protocol Committee was {{dominated}} by Harry Hopkins and General John York, who were totally sympathetic to the provision of [...] "unconditional aid".

2500|$|Heenan {{retired from}} {{managing}} in 1991 {{to become a}} full-time [...] "broadcast journalist". Nonetheless, Heenan crossed the line to managing sporadically. When the WWF signed Ric Flair, Heenan spent several weeks talking Flair up as [...] "The Real World's Heavyweight Champion", appearing onscreen with Flair's Big Gold Belt. He continued {{to act as an}} adviser to Flair during his WWF run from 1991 to 1993. Though he <b>nominally</b> <b>managed</b> Flair, Heenan's former protégé Mr. Perfect, who temporarily retired due to injury, would regularly accompany Flair to ringside as his [...] "Executive Consultant". At the 1993 Royal Rumble, he introduced Lex [...] "Narcissist" [...] Luger to the WWF to exact revenge on his former protégé, Mr. Perfect.|$|E

50|$|Perdew was 37 when {{participating}} in The Apprentice 2 {{and was the}} oldest candidate on the show. He was eventually chosen by Donald Trump to be his apprentice, <b>nominally</b> <b>managing</b> the construction of Trump Place located in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York but in reality promoting it. It was also revealed in The Apprentice 3 finale that Perdew was an executive vice-president for Trump's brand of bottled water, Trump Ice.|$|R

50|$|The chapel is a {{remaining}} {{structure of}} Engenho Poxim, a sugar cane plantation. A plaque above the portal {{of the church}} is dated 1751. According to records taken {{at the time of its}} inspection by IPHAN in 1943, the chapel was under the management of Edgar Rosemberg by the mid-20th century. The chapel was in reasonable condition during a survey in 1947, but had steadily deteriorated according to inspections in 1968 and 1971. It remains in a state of disrepair with few interior elements and is now <b>nominally</b> <b>managed</b> by IPHAN.|$|E
5000|$|As neck {{injuries}} {{prevented him}} from taking bumps {{the way he used}} to, Heenan retired from managing in 1991 to become a full-time [...] "broadcast journalist". Nonetheless, Heenan crossed the line to managing sporadically. When the WWF signed Ric Flair, Heenan spent several weeks talking Flair up as [...] "The Real World's Heavyweight Champion". He continued to act as an advisor to Flair during his 1991-93 WWF run (and coined the phrase, [...] "That's not fair to Flair" [...] and [...] "You got to be fair to Flair"). Though he <b>nominally</b> <b>managed</b> Flair, Heenan's former protégé Mr. Perfect, who temporarily retired due to injury, would regularly accompany Flair to ringside as his [...] "Executive Consultant". At the 1993 Royal Rumble, he introduced Lex [...] "Narcissist" [...] Luger to the WWF to exact revenge on his former protégé, Mr. Perfect.|$|E
40|$|Grassland {{management}} affects soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) storage {{and can be}} used to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, for a country to assess emission reductions due to grassland management, there must be an inventory method for estimating the change in SOC storage. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed a simple carbon accounting approach for this purpose, and here we derive new grassland management factors that represent the effect of changing management on carbon storage for this method. Our literature search identified 49 studies dealing with effects of management practices that either degraded or improved conditions relative to <b>nominally</b> <b>managed</b> grasslands. On average, degradation reduced SOC storage to 95 % +/- 0. 06 and 97 % +/- 0. 05 of carbon stored under nominal conditions in temperate and tropical regions, respectively. In contrast, improving grasslands with a single management activity enhanced SOC storage by 14 % 0. 06 and 17 % +/- 0. 05 in temperate and tropical regions, respectively, and with an additional improvement(s), storage increased by another 11 % +/- 0. 04. We applied the newly derived factor coefficients to analyze C sequestration potential for managed grasslands in the U. S., and found that over a 20 -year period changing management could sequester from 5 to 142 Tg C yr(- 1) or 0. 1 to 0. 9 Mg C ha(- 1) yr(- 1), depending on the level of change. This analysis provides revised factor coefficients for the IPCC method {{that can be used to}} estimate impacts of management; it also provides a methodological framework for countries to derive factor coefficients specific to conditions in their region...|$|E
