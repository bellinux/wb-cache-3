40|$|This {{randomised}} trial compared single gloves with {{combinations of}} double gloves {{to determine the}} subjective effects on comfort, sensitivity and dexterity in 32 surgeons. Glove perforation rates were also compared. Single gloves of the surgeon's normal size (method A) were used as control. Double gloves were worn in three different ways, selected randomly: normal gloves inside and gloves one-half size larger outside (method B); the larger gloves inside and the normal gloves outside (method C); and lastly, two pairs of gloves of normal size (method D). Double gloves by all three methods significantly protected against <b>needle</b> <b>perforation</b> of the inner gloves when compared with single gloves, but also significantly impaired comfort, sensitivity and dexterity. When {{the three types of}} double gloving were compared, there appeared to be advantages for method C for all modalities, but the differences did not reach statistical significance; also, more surgeons expressed a preference for method C. Perforation of the inner gloves was significantly less for double gloves than for single gloves. We conclude that double gloves often protect the surgeon against needle perforations, but are felt to impair comfort, sensitivity and dexterity...|$|E

30|$|All {{animal studies}} {{were carried out}} with the {{approval}} of the National University of Ireland Galway Animal Care Research Ethics Committee and under licence issued by the Public Health Division, Department of Health, Ireland. Specific pathogen-free adult male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Kent, UK), 250 to 300 g in body weight, were used for caecal ligation and perforation (CLP)-isolated heart experiments. Animals were randomised to control (n = 7) or CLP (n = 7) groups. The CLP procedure was carried out under general anaesthesia. Briefly, following midline laparotomy, the caecum was identified and ligated, following which <b>needle</b> <b>perforation</b> was carried out, and wound layers were closed. Animals were returned to housing in individually ventilated cages. At 48 h following operation, animals were harvested for isolated heart protocol using the Langendorff suspension. Animals were sacrificed by means of decapitation. The heart was then removed and suspended from a canula inserted into the aortic root facilitating perfusion with prewarmed Krebs Ringer at 37 °C, oxygenated by means of a gas mixture containing 5 % CO 2 and 95 % O 2, maintaining pH of solution at 7.4. Episodes of ventricular fibrillation were promptly treated with lignocaine bolus 200 mg, administered via a t-piece connected to the aortic canula such that it passes directly through the coronary arteries. Measurements of systolic and diastolic left ventricular (LV) functional characteristics were made with a saline-filled balloon placed in the left ventricle. This balloon was connected to a pressure transducer facilitating provision of a digital readout as a continuous waveform. Balloon volume was adjusted to achieve LVEDP 4 to 8 mmHg, following which the volume of the balloon was maintained constant, thus providing a pre-load-independent measure of contractility. Parameters measured were systolic and diastolic left ventricular pressure (LVP), developed (sys-dias) LVP, maximal and minimal derivatives of LVP (dp/dt LVPmax, dp/dt LVPmin) and heart rate. Global myocardial ischaemia was induced by means of clamping the inflow line for a period of 30 min, followed by 90 min reperfusion. Upon completion of the protocol, the hearts were stained with 1 % 2, 3, 5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), a dye taken up only by viable cells. Myocardial infarct size was determined by direct visualisation, dissection and separation of viable and infarcted heart tissue, which were then weighed and expressed as percentage of total heart weight.|$|E

Objetivo: {{investigar}} a injecao de Dioxido de Carbono (CO 2) na secrecao dos neuropeptideos Peptideo Relacionado ao Gene da Calcitonina (CGRP) e Substancia P (SP) em pele de ratos. Metodos: foram utilizados 56 ratos Wistar-EPM distribuidos em dois grupos, um para analise de CGRP e outro de SP. Cada grupo foi subdividido em 4 subgrupos: controle, controle agulha, injecao de CO 2 e injecao de ar atmosferico, contendo 7 animais respectivamente em cada subgrupo. As analises das amostras de pele parcial foram feitas por Western Blotting (WB). Resultados: No grupo SP houve uma diminuicao na quantidade de neuropeptideos no subgrupo 3 SP-CO 2 e no subgrupo 4 SP -ar; no grupo CGRP, houve uma diminuicao da quantidade de neuropeptideos pro-CGRP (15 kDa) no subgrupo 3 CGRP-CO 2 e no subgrupo 4 CGRP- ar; nao houve diminuicao da quantidade de CGRP (5 kDa).

On the literature there are studies {{that suggest that}} the gas promotes stimulus of the physiological effects, such as circulation improvement, tissue oxygenation, collagen and new elastic fibers formation. Effects that possibly occur after the <b>needle</b> <b>perforation,</b> generating an inflammatory response, aiming to destroy, dilute or block the aggressor agent once the Neurogenic Inflammation (NI) {{is one of the}} first cicatrization events that happen. In response to a skin nonciceptive stimulus, there is the release of proinflammatory cutaneous neuropeptides (NP’s), substances that are produced by the brain cells from dorsal root ganglia and secreted by the skin nervous terminations, and are launched on the inflammatory phase of the cicatrization. Objective: to investigate the Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) injection on the neuropeptides secretion of the Peptide related to the Calcitone (CGRP) and the P Substance (CSP) in rats skin. Method: there were used 56 Wistar-EPM rats divided into two groups, one for CGRP analysis and the other for SP. Each group was subdivided in 4 sub groups: control, needle control CO 2 injection and air injection, each group with 7 rats. The partial skin sample analysis was done by Western Blotting (WB). Results: regarding the presence of the neuropeptides on the rats skin, on the SP group there was a decrease on the amount of the neuropeptides on the subgroup 3 and on the subgroup 4, Air injection; on the CGRP subgroup, there was a decrease on the amount of neuropeptides pro-CGRP, CO 2 injection and also on the subgroup 4, Air injection; on the CGRP group, there was a decrease on the amount of neuropeptides there was proCGRP (15 kDa) on the subgroup 4, injection of CO 2. On the subgroup 4 there wasn’t any decrease on the amount of the effective GCRP (5 kDa).

40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the reliability of}} a newly developed method for pain assessment, {{which is based on}} perceptual matching by Pain Matcher�, Cefar Medical AB, Lund, Sweden, during minor gynecological surgery. In addition, the responsiveness to two different anesthetic methods—electro-acupuncture or a fastacting opiate, alfentanil, both in combination with a paracervical block—was estimated by using Pain Matcher and visual analog scale (VAS) assessments before and 2 h after surgery. Two hundred-twenty-three women (aged 22 – 38 yr) participated. The results show that Pain Matcher is a reliable method for pain assessments, with lack of random individual disagreement and with no statistical evidence of systematic disagreement in position or in concentration. The augmented Optimal pain relief and anesthesia during a minor gynecological surgery, such as transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte aspiration during in vitro fertilization (IVF), is an important goal. Transvaginal follicle puncture requires one or two <b>needle</b> <b>perforations</b> through the vaginal wall to puncture the follicles in the ovary, lasts for approximately 20 to 30 min, and may be the most painful component of IVF treatment. The perceived pain during oocyte aspiration varies to a large extent from one individual to another and is often described in similar terms as intensive menstrual pain (1). The visual analog scale (VAS) has traditionally been used as a method for evaluating the effectiveness of analgesia. The VAS is difficult to interpret, because two steps are involved: the patient’s pain rating and the clinician’s measurement of the patient’s line. Furthermore, the VAS is bounded by fixed end points and Supported by grants from Hjalmar Svensson’s Foundation and Wilhelm and Martina Lundgren’s Foundation. Accepted for publication March 5, 2002.

40|$|Background {{and study}} aims Esophageal {{endoscopic}} submucosal dissection (ESD) is technically {{difficult because of}} narrow working spaces and ease of perforation {{due to the lack}} of serosa. HybridKnife is a recently developed ESD device that is combined with the high pressure waterjet ERBEJET 2 system to lift mucosa. We hypothesized that this waterjet could make submucosal dissection safer and studied this in porcine esophagus. Materials and methods Water pressures of 30  –  70  bar were tested to determine the appropriate pressure for waterjet ESD with HybridKnife (WJ-ESD) in one pig. WJ-ESD safety and completion were compared with those of conventional ESD using DualKnife (C-ESD) as a reference. Each of three virtual esophageal lesions in two pigs were resected alternatively using both methods from the lower to upper esophagus. For WJ-ESD, the submucosa, apart from hard fibrous tissues, was dissected using water pressure alone. Results Using 50  bar of water pressure resulted in the best balance between proper dissection and view-disturbing water backflow. The dissection speeds for the lower, middle, and upper esophagus were 0. 2, 0. 9, and 0. 2  cm 2 /min in 50  bar WJ-ESD and 1. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0  cm 2 /min in C-ESD, respectively. Minor bleeding was frequent in WJ-ESD, but was easily stopped by electrocoagulation with the same <b>needle.</b> No <b>perforation</b> was observed in either procedure. Thermal damage to dissected tissues appeared mild, and the extent of muscle injury was lower for WJ-ESD (4, 6, and 8  %) compared with C-ESD (14, 16, and 7  %).

40|$|Abstract Background Corneal intrastromal {{injection}} is {{an important}} mode of gene-vector application to subepithelial layers. In a mouse model, this procedure is substantially complicated by the reduced corneal dimensions. Furthermore, {{it may be difficult}} to estimate the corneal area reached by the volume of a single injection. This study aimed to investigate intrastromal injections into the mouse cornea using different microneedles and to quantify the effect of injecting varying volumes. A reproducible injection technique is described. Methods Forty eyes of 20 129 [*]Sv/J mice were tested. India ink was intrastromally injected using 30 ° beveled 33 [*]G needles, tri-surface 25 ° beveled 35 [*]G needles, or hand-pulled and 25 ° beveled glass needles. Each eye received a single injection of a volume of 1 or 2 μL. Corneoscleral buttons were fixed and flat mounted for computer-assisted quantification of the affected corneal area. Histological assessment was performed to investigate the intrastromal location of the injected dye. Results A mean corneal area of 5. 0 ± 1. 4 [*]mm 2 (mean[*]±[*]SD) and 7. 7 ± 1. 4 [*]mm 2 was covered by intrastromal injections of 1 and 2 μL, respectively. The mean percentage of total corneal area reached ranged from 39 % to 53 % for 1 μL injections, and from 65 % to 81 % for 2 μL injections. Injections using the 33 [*]G needles tended to provide the highest distribution area. Perforation rates were 8 % for 30 ° beveled 33 [*]G needles and 44 % for tri-surface beveled 35 [*]G <b>needles.</b> No <b>perforation</b> was observed with glass needle; however, intrastromal breakage of needle tips was noted in 25 % of these cases. Conclusions Intracorneal injection using a 30 ° beveled 33 [*]G needle was safe and effective. The use of tri-surface beveled 35 [*]G needles substantially increased the number of corneal <b>perforations.</b> Glass <b>needles</b> may break inside the corneal stroma. Injections of 1 μL and 2 μL resulted in an overall mean of 49 % and 73 % respectively of total corneal area involved. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{an attempt}} to repair the {{perforated}} drum has become quite common. However, as regards the questions what histopathological finding could be observed in both the tympanic membrane and the transplanted graft, and whether such a graft would cover up the perforations to take place of the tympanic membrane, or the graft would play only a role aiding regeneration of the tympanic membrane, there are still no histopathological studies. In order to solve these questions central perforations in pars tensa of the tympanic membrane of rabbits were made with injection <b>needles</b> and these <b>perforations</b> were repaired by transplanting free skin or buccal mucous membrane graft from the same animals, and the following conclusion were obtained. 1. Of the 14 ears transplanted with free skin graft, in 7 cases (50 %) the transplantation was successful, namely, the free skin graft adhered to the tympanic membrane. Of 10 ears receiving the transplantation of buccal mucous membrane graft it was successful in two cases. (20 %). 2. By the fifth to sixth day after the transplantation, there could be observed no marked changes in the skin graft or in the buccal mucous membrane graft, and also no fibrous adhesion could be observed between the transplanted graft and the tympanic membrane. 3. On the seventh day {{it was observed that}} transplantation began to take hold of itself between the transplanted free skin graft or the buccal mucous membrane graft and the tympanic membrane. 4. In the case where the transplantation had come to take hold of itself, the epithelium of the mucous membrane of tympanic membrane, extending along the interior side of the transplanted graft, closed the perforation, and the submucous tissue of tympanic membrane adhered directly to the connective tissue of the skin graft or the buccal mucous membrane graft. 5. When the adhesion takes place, the grafted skin or the buccal mucous membrane loses their morphological characteristics. As the times go on, the structure of the grafted tissues is used to change metaplasically to the tissue which reminds us of the lamina propria of the tympanic membrane. In this instance the new tympanic membrane is quite thick at the beginning but it gradually becomes thinner...|$|R
