500|$|On July 11, 2015, Marvin Carr, {{better known}} by his stage name, Capo, a {{longtime}} member of Keef's Glo Gang label, {{was shot and}} killed in a drive-by shooting in Chicago. Upon killing Capo, the drivers of the vehicle reportedly struck a stroller with 13-month-old Dillan Harris in it, killing the baby instantly. Keef later announced via Twitter that he would be holding a free benefit concert to tribute Capo, as well as encourage concertgoers to donate to Harris' family. Additionally, Keef announced the formation of the Stop the Violence Now Foundation, in an attempt to decrease crime in Chicago. Due to outstanding warrants in Illinois, Keef was scheduled to attend the concert via hologram from a sound stage in Beverly Hills. The concert, organized by HologramUSA and FilmOn Music originally intended to be held in Chicago's Redmoon Theater, faced a series of delays after Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel's office claimed Keef was [...] "an unacceptable role model" [...] and that his music promoted violence. Keef's representatives then worked out an arrangement with promoters of the Craze Fest event, located in Hammond, Indiana, in an attempt to hold the concert there. Keef's hologram was able to plea for peace in Chicago, stating, [...] "Stop the violence, stop nonsense, stop the killing. Let the kids grow up," [...] before performing [...] "I Don't Like". Fearing that the concert was a threat to public safety, Hammond mayor Thomas McDermott, Jr. successfully organized for the city's police to shut down the generators powering Keef's hologram. McDermott was quoted saying, [...] "I know nothing about Chief Keef. All I’d heard was {{he has a lot of}} songs about gangs and shooting people — a history that’s anti-cop, pro-gang and pro-drug use. He’s been basically outlawed in Chicago, and we’re <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> circumvent Mayor Emanuel by going next door." [...] Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn criticized Emmanuel and Hammond for their decisions, claiming they infringed upon Keef's First Amendment rights.|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{was against}} {{reviving}} the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to devote {{some of their}} airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. [...] Romney said, [...] "I'd veto it if it ever got to my desk. And I would fight against it vehemently. The {{effort to try to}} impose the Fairness Doctrine on radio stations is, if you will, censorship Democrat style. It basically says we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> keep talking about the things {{you want to talk about}} and the market wants to hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|After these operas, Glass {{began working}} on a symphonic cycle, {{commissioned}} by the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, who told Glass at the time: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> [...] [...] [...] {{be one of those}} opera composers who never write a symphony". Glass responded with two 3-movement symphonies ("Low" [...] , and Symphony No. 2 [...] ); his first in an ongoing series of symphonies is a combination of the composer's own musical material with themes featured in prominent tracks of the David Bowie/Brian Eno album Low (1977), whereas Symphony No. 2 is described by Glass as a study in polytonality. He referred to the music of Honegger, Milhaud, and Villa-Lobos as possible models for his symphony. With the Concerto Grosso (1992), Symphony No. 3 (1995), a Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra (1995), written for the Rascher Quartet (all commissioned by conductor Dennis Russel Davies), and Echorus (1994/95), a more transparent, refined, and intimate chamber-orchestral style paralleled the excursions of his large-scale symphonic pieces. In the four movements of his Third Symphony, Glass treats a 19-piece string orchestra as an extended chamber ensemble. In the third movement, Glass re-uses the chaconne as a formal device; one commentator characterized Glass's symphony as one of the composer's [...] "most tautly unified works" [...] The third Symphony was closely followed by a fourth, subtitled Heroes (1996), commissioned the American Composers Orchestra. Its six movements are symphonic reworkings of themes by Glass, David Bowie, and Brian Eno (from their album [...] "Heroes", 1977); as in other works by the composer, it is also a hybrid work and exists in two versions: one for the concert hall, and another, shorter one for dance, choreographed by Twyla Tharp.|$|E
