5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, L'Enfant's {{vision of a}} grand {{national}} capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the <b>National</b> <b>Mall.</b> Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core. What {{became known as the}} McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the <b>National</b> <b>Mall,</b> clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service {{originally}} prohibited Capital Bikeshare stations on {{the property}} it manages, including large {{areas such as the}} <b>National</b> <b>Mall.</b> However, the agency later reversed itself and said that it would work to include new stations in future expansions. The first two of five approved Capital Bikeshare stations opened on the <b>National</b> <b>Mall</b> on March 16, 2012, shortly {{before the start of the}} 2012 National Cherry Blossom Festival.|$|E

At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.'s history.|$|E

Independence Day activities require Metro to adjust service to provide extra capacity {{to and from}} the <b>National</b> <b>Mall.</b> WMATA makes similar adjustments during other events, such as presidential inaugurations. Metro has altered service and used some stations as entrances or exits only to help manage congestion.|$|E

5000|$|The Governor’s {{offices were}} moved to their new {{facilities}} in La Alpujarra Administrative Center. When it stopped being the government headquarters, the building was renamed [...] "Rafael Uribe Uribe Palace of Culture" [...] in 1987, in honor of Colombian general Rafael Uribe Uribe who fought in the Thousand Days War. Some people suggested that the Palace became a commercial center, just as had happened with the Major Seminary (now Villanueva Commercial Center) and the National Palace (now known as the <b>National</b> Palace <b>Mall).</b> Others suggested demolishing the Palace {{to build a new}} building.|$|R

5|$|The museum's <b>National</b> <b>Mall</b> {{building}} construction began in mid-1983. The project, which also included the Sackler Gallery for the Smithsonian's Asian art, created 368,000 {{square feet of}} exhibition space {{at a cost of}} $73.2 million, half of which from the federal government. Almost all of this room was created underground so as not to affect the quadrangle's landmark Smithsonian Institution Building (the Castle), its greenery, or its view. The Smithsonian Castle hides the museum and South Quadrangle from the <b>National</b> <b>Mall,</b> which has contributed to the museum's lower attendance compared with other Mall attractions. The quadrangle project's design architect was Jean-Paul Carlhian of Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson & Abbott, based on a concept by Junzō Yoshimura. The two new museums had little involvement in the architectural designs, which were drawn in the 1970s prior to their arrival.|$|E
50|$|Also {{important}} to the local economy are Wawa, Comcast, Citizens Bank, Sunoco, and Lukoil. These companies all have many major sponsorships.

40|$|More than 100 years ago, the Japanese {{government}} presented flowering {{cherry trees}} {{as a gift}} to the U. S. government. Those wonderful living gifts have blossomed along the <b>National</b> <b>Mall’s</b> Tidal Basin, as well as at other locations around Washington, D. C., since then. In April 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced a gift of 3, 000 flowering dogwood trees to Japan to commemorate the 100 th anniversary of Japan’s gift of cherry trees to the United States. The job of finding the right dogwoods belongs to scientists at the U. S. National Arboretum, in Washington, D. C. Agricultural Research Service plant geneticist Richard Olsen has worked to determine the appropriate dogwood cultivars for the varied Japanese climate and to locate the planting material. “There are many things to consider, including temperature range and insect pests to which particular dogwood candidates may be susceptible,” says Olsen. The planning group—which includes the U. S. Department of State; the U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Forest Service, and ARS; and the U. S. /Japan Bridging Foundation, a nonprofit organization—sent the first batch of 150 trees to Japan, and they were planted in Tokyo in November 2012. Altogether, a total of 1, 000 will be planted in Tokyo, 1, 000 in the Tohoku region in honor of the tsunami victims, and the final 1, 000 will be distributed to schools and other organizations throughout the country. “We are evaluating the performance of dogwood germplasm at the arboretum as well as novel cultivars available in the American nursery industry to find those most suited to the Japanese clime,” says Olsen. The arboretum has, for decades, collected dogwood germplasm from across the United States—it is found from Florida to Michigan and as far west as Missouri and Texas...|$|R
50|$|Eid {{is known}} in Indonesia as Hari Raya Idul Fitri (or more popularly as Lebaran) and is a <b>national</b> holiday.

5000|$|This once-popular spot in Mesquite housed {{department}} stores, retail shops, {{an early}} form of arcade, {{and even a}} movie theater (which has since been demolished). Even after Town East Mall had long since become the new [...] "hotspot" [...] for local and <b>national</b> retailers, the <b>mall</b> stayed active for several years with privately owned shops targeting urban young. Montgomery Ward, the last remaining anchor store, was closed after going bankrupt in 2001, thus sealing the mall's eventual demise.|$|R
