5|$|The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis plays a {{key role}} in {{maintaining}} thyroid hormone levels within normal limits. Production of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated in turn by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), released from the hypothalamus. Production of TSH and TRH is decreased by thyroxine by a negative feedback process. <b>Not</b> <b>enough</b> TRH, which is uncommon, can lead to <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> TSH and thereby to <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> thyroid hormone production.|$|E

5000|$|Taylor {{has spent}} much of his career as an MS sufferer, and while he had never done public {{speaking}} prior to his diagnosis, he soon became an active public speaker. He has stated he loves it and enjoys the benefits others get from him, saying [...] "Frankly, most people don't have a disability as dramatic as MS. They see themselves as 'not enough' - <b>not</b> thin <b>enough,</b> <b>not</b> creative <b>enough,</b> <b>not</b> smart <b>enough,</b> <b>not</b> educated <b>enough</b> - whatever. And they become obsessed with their 'not enough-ness.' So life just continues to agree with them. It's a self-fulfilling prophesy, isn't it? Life is to be lived and I encourage people to live it." [...] His signature speech is titled The Domain of Opportunity - a Simple Shift of Focus.|$|R

5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} {{is the only}} source of thyroid hormone in the body; the process {{requires}} iodine and the amino acid tyrosine. Iodine in the bloodstream is taken up by the gland and incorporated into thyroglobulin molecules. The process is controlled by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin), which is secreted by the pituitary. <b>Not</b> <b>enough</b> iodine, or <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> TSH, can result in decreased production of thyroid hormones.|$|E

5|$|As Sylvester himself observed, Sylvester's {{sequence}} {{seems to}} be unique in having such quickly growing values, while simultaneously having a series of reciprocals that converges to a rational number. This sequence provides an example showing that double-exponential growth is <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to cause an integer sequence to be an irrationality sequence.|$|E
5|$|Croyle {{played the}} entire game at {{quarterback for the}} Chiefs' regular season opener against the Baltimore Ravens when Cassel was still unable to play.

5|$|In 1811, Bernard Courtois {{discovered}} iodine {{was present}} in seaweed, and iodine intake was linked with goiter size in 1820 by Jean-Francois Coindet.

5|$|Initial {{management}} with non–medication based treatments is recommended. NSAIDs {{are recommended}} {{if these are}} not sufficiently effective. Normal activity should be continued {{as much as the}} pain allows. Medications are recommended for the duration that they are helpful. A number of other options are available {{for those who do not}} improve with usual treatment. Opioids may be useful if simple pain medications are <b>not</b> <b>enough,</b> but they are not generally recommended due to side effects. Surgery may be beneficial for those with disc-related chronic pain and disability or spinal stenosis. No clear benefit has been found for other cases of non-specific low back pain. Low back pain often affects mood, which may be improved by counseling or antidepressants. Additionally, there are many alternative medicine therapies, including the Alexander technique and herbal remedies, but there is <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> evidence to recommend them confidently. The evidence for chiropractic care and spinal manipulation is mixed.|$|E
