From 1991 to 1993, the structures division of Sétra, directed by Michel Virlogeux, carried out preliminary studies, and examined the feasibility of a single structure spanning the valley. Taking into account technical, architectural, and financial issues, the Administration of Roads opened the question for competition among structural engineers and architects to widen the search for realistic designs.

METHODS: The guideline was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the pediatric literature. Recommendations were formulated by a <b>national</b> <b>multidisciplinary</b> committee involving all stakeholders in neonatal and pediatric intensive care and were based on research evidence from the literature and, in areas where the evidence was insufficient or lacking, on consensus after discussions in the committee. RESULTS: Because of the lack of evidence in neonates and children, trials conducted in adults were considered. We found several recent meta-analyses that show excess mortality in albumin-treated groups, compared with crystalloid-treated groups, and one recent large randomized controlled trial that found evidence of no mortality difference. We found no evidence that synthetic colloids are superior to crystalloid solutions.

The second step consisted to collected data on the drivers' trajectories on the field site during two periods: before the setting-up of the centerline rumble strips (CRS), and the second one after the setting-up.

METHODS: Analysis of three indicator set development procedures: the EPA Cardio project, which used international GP panels; the UniRap project, a Dutch GP indicator project; and the Vitale Vaten project, which used a <b>national</b> <b>multidisciplinary</b> health professional panel and a stakeholder panel. RESULTS: With respect to clinical indicators, consistency between procedures varied according to the origin of the indicators.

Considering organisational indicators, 27 indicators were rated in both EPA Cardio and Vitale Vaten. In the Vitale Vaten project 17 indicators (63 %) were validated, including eight of the nine indicators validated in EPA Cardio.

The panel received a summary of the literature pertaining to each measure and rated the measures by use of a modified Delphi approach for 6 dimensions of quality, including validity of evidence, feasibility, impact on outcomes, room for improvement, plausibility, and an overall rating (little reason to do, could do, should do, and must do). Results—Highly rated and agreed on performance measures for the overall rating include warfarin in atrial fibrillation, antithrombotics on hospital discharge, carotid imaging in appropriate patients, and use of stroke units.
