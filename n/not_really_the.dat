5|$|The {{historian}} Roger Just {{states the}} main {{principle of the}} epiklerate was that no man could become the guardian of the property without also becoming the husband of the epikleros. Just uses this principle to claim that any man adopted by the father of an epikleros was required to marry the epikleros. Just states that the forcible divorce and remarriage of an epikleros was based on this principle, arguing that if {{the father of the}} epikleros had not adopted the first husband, the husband was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> heir. Just sees the development of the epiklerate as flowing from Solon's desire to keep the number of Athenian households constant. According to Just, before Solon's legislation, the epikleros was just treated as part of the property, but that Solon's reforms transformed the epikleros into a transmitter of the property and her son the automatic heir to her father's estate.|$|E
25|$|It {{is tempting}} {{to think that the}} notion of {{function}} problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (a,b,c) such that the relation a×b=c holds. Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.|$|E

Both the Olympics and rugby union were officially amateur, {{but this was}} <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> case. For example, the Dinamo clubs were {{sponsored}} and financed by the KGB, {{but no one could}} say that openly that some athletes were full-time shamateurs, and received bonuses for winning including dollars. Masters of Sport were full time, and paid by their sports society. They received 180 rubles each year, plus 30-40 rubles if they were capped for the USSR team paid for by the USSR sports committee. There were frequently unofficial bonuses, and some people could be Masters of Sport for life, meaning that they would receive pay long after their retirement.|$|E

The many threads of the story became complicated, and after four months they found themselves lost in the process.

[...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> case that we were suffering from writer's block," [...] Joel said in a 1991 interview, [...] "but our working speed had slowed, and we were eager to get a certain distance from Miller's Crossing."

White criticized Deangelo Vickers, noting {{that she did not}} have a handle on the character and that he was too [...] "downright normal" [...] and [...] "practically boring". McNutt argued that, while Ferrell [...] "is <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> problem with the role" [...] of Deangelo Vickers, the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like [...] "hanging out to commemorate the former’s departure from a television show" [...] rather than the two playing believable characters. He also felt that Deangelo [...] "feels disruptive to the show’s narrative" [...] because his character {{gets in the way of}} the plot. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent [...] "so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do". He further noted that [...] "nobody has come up with a good reason for him being here other than that he's Will Ferrell." ...|$|E

Ebner stated that [...] "Hacking their site is <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> best way to go about taking them (the Church of Scientology) down. Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to be up there so that people who are interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting a thousand other opinions." [...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing they used to do when they really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing they actually have to figure out some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|Supporters of {{the series}} assert {{that it is a}} worthy {{interpretation}} of the book and that most of the changes were necessary. Many who worked on the series are fans of the book, including Christopher Lee, who (alone among the cast) had actually met Tolkien in person, and Boyens once noted that no matter what, it is simply their interpretation of the book. Jackson once said that to simply summarize the story on screen would be a mess, and in his own words, [...] "Sure, it's <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>The</b> Lord of the Rings... but it could still be a pretty damn cool movie." [...] Other fans also claim that, despite any changes, the films serve as a tribute to the book, appealing to those who have not yet read it, and even leading some to do so. The Movie Guide for The Encyclopedia of Arda (an online Tolkien encyclopedia) states that Jackson's films were exceptional since filming the whole story of The Lord of the Rings was probably impossible. This notion is partially supported by a review published in 2005 that otherwise criticized a lack of [...] "faithfulness to Tolkien's spirit and tone." ...|$|E

500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, and I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E
500|$|It {{may have}} been {{possible}} for the husband of an epikleros to allow the posthumous adoption of {{the son of an}} epikleros as the son of the epikleros' [...] father. This would prevent the inheritance of the newly adopted son of any property from his natural father, but it had the advantage of preserving the adoptee's oikos, commonly translated as [...] "household" [...] but incorporating ideas of kinship and property also. Although the preservation of the paternal oikos is usually felt to be the reason behind the whole practice of the epiklerate, the historian David Schaps argues that in fact, this was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> point of the practice. Instead, he argues, that it was the practice of adoption that allowed the preservation of an oikos. Schaps feels that the reason the epiklerate evolved was to ensure that orphaned daughters were married. Other historians, including Sarah Pomeroy, feel that the children of an epikleros were considered to transmit the paternal grandfather's oikos. The historian Cynthia Patterson agrees, arguing that adoption may have seemed unnecessary, especially if the epikleros and her husband gave their son the name of the maternal grandfather. She argues that too much {{attention has been paid to}} the patrilineal aspects of the oikos, and that there was probably less emphasis on this in actual Athenian practice and more on keeping a household together as a productive unit.|$|E
500|$|Multiple reviewers {{have called}} the Sci-Fi Dine-In more notable for being an {{attraction}} than a food destination. One reviewer from The Guardian compares the Sci-Fi Dine-In to Epcot's Coral Reef Restaurant, writing that both restaurants [...] "are great settings" [...] where [...] "eating is awful". Sehlinger and Testa consider the prices too high, and the food too simple, although they praise the Reuben sandwich and the ribs. Schultz writes that the food is simple {{and that some of}} the beers are decent. The book DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Walt Disney World Resort & Orlando also states that the food is more expensive than it is worth. Ed Bumgardner of the Winston-Salem Journal shared this opinion as well, specifically singling out the restaurant's roast beef sandwich as a ripoff, despite calling it delicious. Peggy Katalinich of the Tampa Bay Times writes that, although the food is mediocre, [...] "Who cares? Food is besides the point". She goes on to argue that the prices are low, particularly for sandwiches. In Frommer's Walt Disney World and Orlando 2012, Laura Lea Miller expresses disappointment that the menu no longer contains the playful item names it once did. She writes positively of the atmosphere, but considers the food mediocre. In the book Walt Disney World Resort: Also Includes Seaworld and Central Florida, Corey Sandler writes that the Sci-Fi Dine-In is [...] "a must-see eatery... for adults and adventurous kids" [...] and that [...] "the food is appropriate for a drive-in theater—very ordinary, but that's <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> reason you came".|$|E

2500|$|By now, Glazer was {{becoming}} {{skeptical of the}} War on Poverty and of Washington-based reform efforts in general.

2500|$|Some experts suspect (see, for example, [...] ) that {{triangulated}} {{categories are}} <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> [...] "correct" [...] concept. The essential {{reason is that}} the mapping cone of a morphism is unique only up to a non-unique isomorphism. In particular the mapping cone of a morphism does not in general depend functorially on the morphism (note the non-uniqueness in axiom (TR 3), for example). This non-uniqueness is a potential source of errors. The axioms do however seem to work adequately in practice, and {{there is a great deal}} of literature devoted to their study.|$|E

Kneale found the character [...] "a rather prissy sort of person, <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> sort of person I usually played at all." [...] A late change to the script was changing the sex of the biologist character, George Dawnay, to Madeline Dawnay; writing to Mary Morris offering her the part, Hayes said, [...] "don't be put off {{by the fact that the}} lady appears to smoke a pipe half way through and give vent to some rather strange utterances." ...|$|E
