He has no problem—and he's cashed plenty of checks—with our show making fun of Christians." [...] According to Stone, neither he nor Trey Parker had [...] "heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology.

[...] Stone commented that [...] "In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons and Jews. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show. To bring the civil rights struggle into this is just a non sequitur. Of course we will release Isaac from his contract and we wish him well." [...] According to a later commentary by Stone, prior to the episode's screening Hayes had asked the South Park creators to have Comedy Central pull the episode before it aired and not include it in the series DVD, which they refused.|$|E

5000|$|For several years, Bass {{has been}} {{predicting}} impending financial crisis for Japan, describing {{its approach to}} financing debt as a Ponzi scheme similar to Bernie Madoff's investment scam. Most experts have disagreed with his analysis. Cullen Roche criticized Bass's Japan analysis in August 2010, noting that Bass comparing Japan to the EU was an error, since their monetary systems are wildly different. Roche stated [...] "people still fail to understand that a nation with monetary sovereignty that is the supplier of currency in a floating exchange rate system <b>never</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> funding itself."
