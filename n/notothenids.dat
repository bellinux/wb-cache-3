40|$|Pseudochaenichthys georgianus is {{a member}} of the unique Channichthyidae family of fishes, which lack haemoglobin. The distribution, length-frequency and summer diet are {{described}} from 14 bottom trawl surveys undertaken in the summers between 1986 and 2006. Pseudochaenichthys georgianus (50 - 590 mm TL) were caught throughout the South Georgia shelf from depths of 76 - 370 m, but very few specimens (< 1 %) were caught on the Shag Rocks shelf. Multiple cohorts were present during each survey and length-frequency analysis of these cohorts suggests that growth is fast during the first 3 - 4 years. Stomach contents analysis (2005 & 2006) indicated that P. georgianus is a pelagic or semi pelagic predator, with the summer diet dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Fish (channichthyids and <b>notothenids)</b> were also taken, but were a relatively minor part of the diet...|$|E
40|$|The mesopelagic fish {{community}} of the northern Scotia Sea was investigated during the austral autumn using multi-frequency acoustics, opening and closing nets and pelagic trawls fished from the surface to 1, 000 m. The Family Myctophidae (15 species in 5 genera) dominated the ichthyofauna, with larval <b>notothenids</b> caught over the South Georgia shelf and bathylagids and stomiids abundant in deeper hauls. The biomass of myctophids {{was estimated to be}} 2. 93 g wet weight 1, 000 m- 3, with Electrona carlsbergi, E. antarctica, Protomyctophum bolini, P. choriodon, Gymnoscopelus braueri, G. fraseri, G. nicholsi and Krefftichthys anderssoni, being the most abundant species. Analysis of community structure indicated a high level of depth stratification within the myctophids, with evidence of diurnal vertical migration in some, but not all, species. Length-frequencies of G. braueri, G. nicholsi, E. antarctica and K. anderssoni were multimodal, suggesting that all life stages may be present in the northern Scotia Sea. In contrast, P. choriodon, P. bolini, G. fraseri and E. carlsbergi had unimodal distributions despite having multi-year lifecycles, indicating that they probably migrate into the region from warmer areas to the north...|$|E
40|$|Fatty acid {{signature}} analysis (FASA) {{makes use of}} specific fatty acids, as well as entire profiles, to study dietary relationships at different trophic levels. Previously, FASA {{has been used in}} marine ecosystems in which diet determination by more direct methods is difficult and sometimes misleading. This study examined fatty acid profiles in milk from 2 species of pinniped from the Southern Ocean that were expected to have highly contrasting diets. Milk samples were collected from Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella in 3 consecutive years, from 1991 to 1993 (n = 72), and from Southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina in 1988 (n = 53) at South Georgia. Lipids were extracted and fatty acid profiles determined by temperature-programmed gas chromatography. Possible prey species collected from waters around South Georgia were also analysed. Cluster analysis as well as classification and regression trees (CART) indicated that profiles from fur seals and elephant seals were significantly different. Southern elephant seal data could be distinguished from Antarctic fur seals by lower levels of the fatty acids 16 : 4 n 1, 18 : 2 n 6, 18 : 4 n 3, 18 : 4 n 1 and 20 : 5 n 3 and by higher levels of 18 : 0, 18 : 1 n 9 / n 11 (i. e. 18 : 1 n 9 co-eluting with 18 : 1 n 11) and 20 : 1 n 9. Fatty acid signatures from the milk of Antarctic fur seals were closest to krill and fish species that were also known to feed on krill. Southern elephant seal fatty acid profiles were closest to species that are not known as krill predators such as larger <b>notothenids</b> and myctophids. The fatty acid profiles of Antarctic fur seals showed considerable inter- and intra-annual variability, which was congruent with diet variability detected using scat analyses. Southern elephant seals showed little variation in profile through lactation. In contrast to previous diet analyses based on examination of stomach contents, the results from FASA were consistent with a fish-based diet for Southern elephant seals...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and diet of juvenile (< 750 mm) Patagonian toothfish are described from 4 annual trawl surveys (2003 - 06) {{around the island}} of South Georgia in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Recruitment of toothfish varies inter-annually, and a single large cohort dominated during the four years surveyed. Most juveniles were caught on the Shag Rocks shelf to the NW of South Georgia, with fish subsequently dispersing to deeper water around both the South Georgia and Shag Rocks shelves. Mean size of juvenile toothfish increased with depth of capture. Stomach contents analysis was conducted on 795 fish that contained food remains and revealed that juvenile toothfish are essentially piscivorous, with the diet dominated by <b>notothenid</b> fish. The yellow-finned notothen, Patagonotothen guntheri, was the dominant prey at Shag Rocks whilst at South Georgia, where P. guntheri is absent, the dominant prey were Antarctic krill and <b>notothenid</b> fish. The diet changed with size, {{with an increase in}} myctophid fish and krill as toothfish grow and disperse. The size of prey also increased with fish size, with a greater range of prey sizes consumed by larger fish...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the ecology and life history of the deepwater <b>notothenid,</b> Dissostichus eleginoides, on the Patagonian Shelf. Archival tagging revealed strong site fidelity of adult toothfish with the majority of fish remaining within 50 km of release. Furthermore depth data revealed three behavioural patterns showing feeding, seasonal and spawning activities. The trophic ecology of five notothenioids was studied, examining resource utilisation and niche separation on the Falklandâ€™s shelf. Spatial, ontogenic and seasonal variations in the parasite fauna for juvenile D. eleginoides are described and potential species for use as biological tags to study toothfish population structure are suggested. Validated age readings gave maximum estimated ages of 35 (L = 214. 3 cm) and 26 years (L = 126. 3 cm) for females and males respectively and reasons for this sexual dimorphism are discussed. Comparisons of otolith transition zones and growth rates from different regions shows toothfish have adapted their life history traits dependant on their environmental and hydrological surroundings, with populations in warmer areas growing quicker than those in cooler waters. Reproduction in toothfish is discontinuous and group synchronous and final spawning was found to occur in batches. Toothfish predominantly spawn only in one region around the Falklands, on the Burdwood Bank, mainly during July/August. Evidence of skipped spawning was identified indicating that not all fish spawn annually and this aspect is discussed in terms of body condition, periodic strong recruitment and the lack of large scale migrations of adult toothfish. Toothfish around the Falklands have a higher fecundity compared to other regions, a potential adaption to living north of the polar front. This new information on age, growth, reproduction and movements of toothfish, combined with its role in the Patagonian shelf and slope ecosystems, is vital for accurate stock assessment and hence sustainable fisheries management.
