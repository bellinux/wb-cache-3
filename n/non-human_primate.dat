The Stop Primate Experiments at Cambridge (SPEAC) campaign succeeded in persuading the university to abandon its plans in January 2004.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, SPEAC {{learned that}} Oxford University planned {{to build a}} new animal {{research}} laboratory, including a <b>non-human</b> <b>primate</b> lab, in the university's science area. The activists said that talks between Oxford and Cambridge had resulted in Oxford agreeing to conduct the brain experiments that were lost with the abandonment of Cambridge's plans. SPEAC became SPEAK, The Voice for the Animals, relaunching itself as a campaign to halt all animal testing in the UK, with its second target the new Oxford lab, which opened in November 2008.|$|E
25|$|As {{a dental}} anthropologist, Corruccini is most noted {{for his work}} on malocclusion, though his {{research}} is not limited to any particular aspect of human or <b>non-human</b> <b>primate</b> dentition or biology. Much of his early fieldwork in dentition and many of his 250-plus publications focused on twins, immigrants, Australian Aborigines, and on the Indian subcontinent, with this research being funded by the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Leakey Foundation. However, Corruccini's research into malocclusion led him to conduct broad and comprehensive studies among a diverse number of subjects, including an isolate population of European-Americans in rural Kentucky, the Pima Tribe, natives of Peru, hominoids, and modern Chinese.|$|E

25|$|A {{transplant}} {{of organs}} or tissue from one species to another. An example is porcine heart valve transplant, {{which is quite}} common and successful. Another example is attempted piscine-primate (fish to <b>non-human</b> <b>primate)</b> transplant of islet (i.e. pancreatic or insular tissue) tissue. The latter research study was intended {{to pave the way}} for potential human use if successful. However, xenotransplantion is often an extremely dangerous type of transplant because of the increased risk of non-compatibility, rejection, and disease carried in the tissue. In an opposite twist, Ganogen Research Institute CEO Eugene Gu is studying how to transplant human fetal hearts and kidneys into animals for future transplantation into human patients to address the shortage of donor organs.|$|E
25|$|There is {{converging}} {{evidence from}} cognitive neuroscientists {{around the world}} that age-induced cognitive deficits may not be due to neuronal loss or cell death, but rather {{may be the result of}} small region-specific changes to the morphology of neurons. Studies by Duan et al., have shown that dendritic arbors and dendritic spines of cortical pyramidal neurons decrease in size and/or number in specific regions and layers of human and <b>non-human</b> <b>primate</b> cortex as a result of age (Duan et al., 2003; morph). Interestingly, a 46% decrease in spine number and spine density has been reported in humans older than 50 compared with younger individuals. An electron microscopy study in monkeys reported a 50% loss in spines on the apical dendritic tufts of pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex of old animals (27–32 years old) compared with young ones (6–9 years old).|$|E
25|$|A {{handful of}} {{comparative}} psychologists {{have attempted to}} demonstrate quasi-economic reasoning in non-human animals. Early attempts along these lines focus {{on the behavior of}} rats and pigeons. These studies draw on the tenets of comparative psychology, where the main goal is to discover analogs to human behavior in experimentally-tractable non-human animals. They are also methodologically similar to the work of Ferster and Skinner. Methodological similarities aside, early researchers in non-human economics deviate from behaviorism in their terminology. Although such studies are set up primarily in an operant conditioning chamber using food rewards for pecking/bar-pressing behavior, the researchers describe pecking and bar-pressing not in terms of reinforcement and stimulus-response relationships but instead in terms of work, demand, budget, and labor. Recent studies have adopted a slightly different approach, taking a more evolutionary perspective, comparing economic behavior of humans to a species of <b>non-human</b> <b>primate,</b> the capuchin monkey.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. Research in <b>non-human</b> <b>primates</b> is an {{essential}} part of biomedical progress in the 21st century. Research in <b>non-human</b> <b>primates</b> has led to the development of crucial medical treatments, such as vaccines against poliomyelitis and hepatitis (jaundice), as well as to improved drug safety thanks to indispensable contributions to the basic principles of physiology, immunology, infectious diseases, genetics, pharmacology, reproduction biology and neuroscience. We predict an increased need for research using <b>non-human</b> <b>primates</b> in the future, e.g. for personalized medicine and neurodegenerative diseases in an aging society. This continuing need is also reflected in the EU Directive of 2010 (2010 /63/EU) on animals used for scientific purposes, in which it is recognized that research in <b>non-human</b> <b>primates</b> will remain irreplaceable in the foreseeable future.|$|R

25|$|Current {{research}} suggests that polyandry is the dominant social structure in the Callitrichidae subfamily of New World monkeys. The Callitrichidae family includes marmosets and tamarins, two groups of small New World monkeys found in South America. Wild groups usually consist of three to ten individuals, with one reproductively active female, one or more reproductive males, and several nonreproductive helpers that can be either male or female. Interestingly, cooperative polyandry {{is not the only}} mating system found in these primates. Polyandrous, monogamous, and polygynous groups can be found within the same population, and a group can even change mating systems, making it the most flexible mating system of any <b>non-human</b> <b>primate.</b> Unlike most primates who typically give birth to single young, twins are the average litter size for tamarins and marmosets. The entire group participates in raising the offspring, sharing the responsibilities of infant carrying, feeding, and grooming. The presence of nonreproductive helpers appears {{to be the most important}} factor in determining which mating system is used, as ecological and environmental variability have not been found to have a significant impact. Goldizen (1987) proposed the hypothesis that monogamy in Callitrichidae should develop only in groups with nonreproductive helpers to help raise the young, and in the absence of these helpers, both polyandrous males and females would have higher reproductive success than those in lone monogamous pairs. Indeed, in studies of Saguinus fuscicollis, common name saddle-back tamarin, no monogamous lone pairs have ever been seen to attempt a breeding cycle.|$|E

2500|$|Every lethal {{viral disease}} {{presents}} a paradox: killing its host is obviously of no {{benefit to the}} virus, so how and why did it evolve to do so? Today {{it is believed that}} most viruses are relatively benign in their natural hosts; some viral infection might even be beneficial to the host. The lethal viral diseases are believed to have resulted from an [...] "accidental" [...] jump of the virus from a species in which it is benign to a new one that is not accustomed to it (see zoonosis).

40|$|Malaria {{is caused}} by Plasmodium parasites which are {{transmitted}} by anopheline mosquitoes. Until recently, human malaria {{was considered to be}} caused by human-specific Plasmodia spp. Studies on the evolution of Plasmodium parasites in <b>non-human</b> <b>primates,</b> however, have indicated that Plasmodium species can switch hosts and may be transferred from <b>non-human</b> <b>primates</b> to humans and vice versa. The requirements for such a cross-species exchange and especially the role of mosquitoes are discussed. One of the most important vectors of human malaria is the mosquito Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto because it is highly anthropophilic and prefers to feed indoors. It is unknown which mosquito species would bite both humans and <b>non-human</b> <b>primates</b> and if so, whether humans and <b>non-human</b> <b>primates</b> share the same Plasmodium vectors. To understand the vector-host interactions that can lead to an increased Plasmodium transmission between species, studies are required that reveal the nature of these interactions. Studying the possible role of <b>non-human</b> <b>primates</b> as a Plasmodium reservoir will contribute to the ongoing efforts of human malaria elimination, and will help to focus on critical areas that should be considered in achieving this goal...|$|R
2500|$|Tomasello's 1999 {{review of}} the {{research}} contrasting human and <b>non-human</b> <b>primate</b> learning strategies confirms biological anthropologist Ralph Holloway's 1969 argument that a specific kind of sociality linked to symbolic cognition were the keys to human evolution, and constitute the nature of culture. According to Holloway, the key issue {{in the evolution of}} H. sapiens, and the key to understanding [...] "culture," [...] "is how man organizes his experience." [...] Culture is [...] "the imposition of arbitrary form upon the environment." [...] This fact, Holloway argued, is primary to and explains what is distinctive about human learning strategies, tool-use, and language. Human tool-making and language express [...] "similar, if not identical, cognitive processes" [...] and provide important evidence for how humankind evolved.|$|E
2500|$|Serial recall is {{the ability}} to recall items or events in the order in which they occurred.

2500|$|The {{studies were}} {{motivated}} by John Bowlby's World Health Organization-sponsored study and report, [...] "Maternal Care and Mental Health" [...] in 1950, in which Bowlby reviewed previous studies {{on the effects of}} institutionalization on child development, and the distress experienced by children when separated from their mothers, such as René Spitz's and his own surveys on children raised in a variety of settings. In 1953, his colleague, James Robertson, produced a short and controversial documentary film, titled A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital, demonstrating the almost-immediate effects of maternal separation. Bowlby's report, coupled with Robertson's film, demonstrated the importance of the primary caregiver in human and <b>non-human</b> <b>primate</b> development. Bowlby de-emphasized the mother's role in feeding as a basis {{for the development of a}} strong mother–child relationship, but his conclusions generated much debate. It was the debate concerning the reasons behind the demonstrated need for maternal care that Harlow addressed in his studies with surrogates. Physical contact with infants was considered harmful to their development, and this view led to sterile, contact-less nurseries across the country. Bowlby disagreed, claiming that the mother provides much more than food to the infant, including a unique bond that positively influences the child's development and mental health.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>non-human</b> <b>primate</b> {{models of}} AIDS, using HIV-2, SHIV, and SIV in macaques, {{have been used}} as a {{complement}} to ongoing research efforts against the virus. The drug tenofovir has had its efficacy and toxicology evaluated in macaques, and found longterm-highdose treatments had adverse effects not found using short term-high dose treatment followed by long term-low dose treatment. This finding in macaques was translated into human dosing regimens. Prophylactic treatment with anti-virals has been evaluated in macaques, because introduction of the virus can only be controlled in an animal model. The finding that prophylaxis can be effective at blocking infection has altered the treatment for occupational exposures, such as needle exposures. Such exposures are now followed rapidly with anti-HIV drugs, and this practice has resulted in measurable transient virus infection similar to the NHP model. Similarly, the mother-to-fetus transmission, and its fetal prophylaxis with antivirals such as tenofovir and AZT, has been evaluated in controlled testing in macaques not possible in humans, and this knowledge has guided antiviral treatment in pregnant mothers with HIV. [...] "The comparison and correlation of results obtained in monkey and human studies is leading to a growing validation and recognition of the relevance of the animal model. Although each animal model has its limitations, carefully designed drug studies in nonhuman primates can continue to advance our scientific knowledge and guide future clinical trials." ...|$|E
