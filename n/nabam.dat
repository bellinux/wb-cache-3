40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{action of}} tetramethylene diisothiocyanate (TMDI) and of disodium ethylene bisdithiocarbamate (<b>nabam)</b> on the spore germination of Penicillium italicum and of Aspergillus niger is strongly antagonized by the thiol compounds, thioglycollic acid and cysteine. This antagonism {{is supposed to}} be due to a chemical reaction between fungicide and -SH compound. The observation that the preformed reaction products of either of the fungicides with thioglycollic acid are almost non-toxic is strong evidence for this hypothesis. The observed reactivity of thiol compounds towards TMDI and <b>nabam</b> is an indication that the antifungal action of the latter compounds is due to their combination with cell constituents carrying essential -SH groups.
