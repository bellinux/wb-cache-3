40|$|The {{next century}} {{is likely to}} bring {{unforeseen}} genetic and biotechnological discoveries, with new benefits, risks and costs. This paper explores some of the problem areas that healthcare biotechnologies are likely to encounter. Biotechnological interventions may present particular difficulties when they promise a major breakthrough in therapy, since economic evaluation early {{in the development of}} such technologies is inherently uncertain. Given the structure of the biotechnology industry, the perception of the high cost of new products and unknown uncertainties, governments may need to be proactive to ensure that meaningful clinical and economic data are generated in the product research phase and to manage the introduction and diffusion stages with further evaluation and surveillance. Progress usually comes at a price: both governments and the industry should prepare for this rather than offering bland reassurances about safety. <b>Nebacumab,</b> Sepsis, Hepatitis-B, Hepatitis-B-vaccine, Biotechnology, Granulocyte-colony-stimulating-factors, Epoetin-alfa, Pharmacoeconomics, Economic-implications, Immunomodulators...|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) {{are currently}} being approved for marketing in Europe and the United States, {{as well as other}} countries, on a regular basis. As more mAbs become available to physicians and patients, keeping track of the number, types, production cell lines, antigenic targets, and dates and locations of approvals has become challenging. Data are presented here for 34 mAbs that were approved in either Europe or the United States (US) as of March 2012, and nimotuzumab, which is marketed outside Europe and the US. Of the 34 mAbs, 28 (abciximab, rituximab, basiliximab, palivizumab, infliximab, trastuzumab, alemtuzumab, adalimumab, tositumomab-I 131, cetuximab, ibrituximab tiuxetan, omalizumab, bevacizumab, natalizumab, ranibizumab, panitumumab, eculizumab, certolizumab pegol, golimumab, canakinumab, catumaxomab, ustekinumab, tocilizumab, ofatumumab, denosumab, belimumab, ipilimumab, brentuximab) are currently marketed in Europe or the US. Data for six therapeutic mAbs (muromonab-CD 3, <b>nebacumab,</b> edrecolomab, daclizumab, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, efalizumab) that were approved but have been withdrawn or discontinued from marketing in Europe or the US are also included...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Sepsis {{occurs in}} a {{heterogeneous}} population. A prospective nationwide surveillance study found that populations stratified by infection type had {{significant differences in the}} incidence of sepsis syndrome, rate of complications and mortality. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore whether successful identification of population-specific risk factors for disease-associated morbidity and mortality may allow for more accurate assessment of the cost effectiveness of treatment strategies. Design: A decision analytic model was developed using outcomes data on incidence and resolution of major complications in sepsis syndrome. Healthcare resource utilisation data were based on length of hospital stay, intensive care unit stay versus hospital ward stay, and cost of treating sepsis-related complications. Setting: This modelling study, conducted from the perspective of the healthcare institution, used actual outcomes data on 2 infection-specific patient populations. Patients and participants: The 2 populations studied were patients with nosocomial respiratory tract infection or community-acquired urinary tract infection who subsequently developed sepsis syndrome. Interventions: Treatment options modelled were standard therapy plus biotechnology therapy versus standard therapy alone in the treatment of gram-negative sepsis complications. Main outcome measures and results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios differed between the 2 study populations, due to differences in the incidence and rate of resolution of major sepsis-associated complications. The use of biotechnology therapy is always more cost effective in the respiratory tract infection population. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness results for a therapy may change when the epidemiology of the disease state is known and incorporated into the decision analytic model. An infection-specific approach is important in the treatment of sepsis.
