5|$|As other {{scenes of}} Carey in the latex mini {{and by the}} large red hone prop are interspersed, the club scene alters to a poker table, where Ealy reveals three of his card, '556', {{completing}} four of the seven digits of Carey phone number. The next scene finds Carey sitting on a large pink sofa in an empty room in the club, sporting only a white man's suit jacket and stilettos. As the song reaches the bridge, Carey is shown back in the club's main room dancing, as she leaves a number '4' on a <b>nearby</b> <b>table</b> for the man to find. As Carey once again {{is shown in the}} yellow latex dress, she walks down a small aisle, placing another card with the number '4' into Ealy's jacket pocket, before storming through the club by several followers. As the video ends, the number '555-6464' are shown lying on a small table, while Carey sits on the large pink sofa, and Ealy is seen on the other side gazing at her. The video concludes with Ealy slowly approaching Carey on the large sofa, as she winks and smiles to the camera.|$|E

Filming on location mostly took place across South Wales, with {{parts of the}} episode being shot on location in Dartmoor, even though the producers did not originally intend to do so. The first day took place at a cemetery. The producers {{were looking for a}} village in South Wales that was [...] "very English-looking." [...] Scenes of the fictional [...] "Cross Keys" [...] pub were filmed at the Bush Inn in St Hilary, Vale of Glamorgan. The production team donated £500 to the village after filming had finished. In one scene, after Sherlock first witnesses the hound, Sherlock makes deductions about a mother and son from a <b>nearby</b> <b>table.</b> In filming the scene, Cumberbatch has to recall multiple pages of monologue in front of camera, and had to talk faster than he was used to.|$|E

The website featured a public notice indicating that the ride's theme would be stagecoaches and the wild west. The teaser website also stated that an announcement would be made on August 9, 2012. As part of its teaser campaign leading to the announcement, the park released two clues; the first clue was a handwritten letter, while the second was {{a photo of the}} park's [...] attraction and the <b>nearby</b> <b>Table</b> Rock Lake. On August 9, 2012, Silver Dollar City officially announced that Outlaw Run would open {{in the second quarter of}} 2013. At its opening, the ride would be the only wooden roller coaster to feature inversions and would feature the steepest drop on a wooden roller coaster. At a cost of $10 million, the ride would be the most expensive Silver Dollar City attraction in more than a decade.|$|E
500|$|Although shy and {{insecure}} as a teenager, as {{an adult}} Chamberlain became well known for his womanizing. As his lawyer Seymour [...] "Sy" [...] Goldberg put it: [...] "Some people collect stamps, Wilt collected women." [...] Swedish Olympic high jumper Annette Tånnander, who met {{him when he was}} 40 and she 19, remembers him as a pick-up artist who was extremely confident yet respectful: [...] "I think Wilt hit on everything that moved... he never was bad or rude." [...] Many of Chamberlain's personal friends testified that he once had 23 women in 10 days, had no problems organizing a threesome (or more), and particularly enjoyed a TV skit on the television show In Living Color in which a mother and her daughter approach a Vietnam Wall-like list of women who slept with him, both of them pointing out that their names are on it, as well as a 1991 Saturday Night Live sketch where MC Hammer played Chamberlain in [...] "Remembrances of Love", where Chamberlain spoofs a soap opera with romances with women that are usually over in five minutes. [...] However, Los Angeles Times columnist David Shaw claimed that during a dinner with Shaw and his wife, Chamberlain was [...] "rude and sexist toward his own date, as he usually was", adding that at one point Chamberlain left the table to get the phone number of an attractive woman at a <b>nearby</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Columbus {{landed in}} Cuba {{in a place}} he named Porto Santo. It is {{generally}} assumed from his description that this was Baracoa, although there are also claims it was Gibara.

He wrote in his logbook [...] "the most beautiful {{place in the world}} ...I heard the birds sing that they will never ever leave this place...".

50|$|Taverns served {{multiple}} functions on the Southern colonial frontier. Society in Rowan County, North Carolina, {{was divided}} along lines of ethnicity, gender, race, and class, but in taverns the boundaries often overlapped, as diverse groups were brought together at <b>nearby</b> <b>tables.</b> Consumerism {{in the backcountry}} was limited not by ideology or culture but by distance from markets and poor transportation. The increasing variety of drinks served {{and the development of}} clubs indicates that genteel culture spread rapidly from London to the periphery of the English world.|$|R

Four master's degree hopefuls from MIT were seated at a <b>nearby</b> <b>table,</b> fretting at their inability to solve a complex problem which they had been assigned. Never breaking the thread of his own conversation, Ridley abruptly handed the students a notepad he had been scribbling on: [...] "Would this help you any?"

He hit 14-year-old Steven Curnow with a mortal wound to the neck. Harris then shot under the adjacent computer desk, injuring 17-year-old Kacey Ruegsegger with a shot which passed completely through her right shoulder and hand, also grazing her neck and severing a major artery. When she started gasping in pain, Harris tersely stated, [...] "Quit your bitching." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{other kind}} of event is the Oyster Roast. Sheet metal or a fine mesh grill is placed over hot coals. Oysters are piled onto the grill (after having the mud washed off their shells). Wet burlap sacks are draped over the shells and the oysters are half grilled and half steamed. A shovel is used to scoop them onto <b>nearby</b> <b>tables</b> (plywood sheets on {{sawhorses}} works as well as anything). The shells have popped open (and are still hot), but the oysters are attached and just need a little coaxing to come free. This is particularly popular in the winter (the 'R' months, being the months in which oysters may be harvested in South Carolina.) when the oysters are good and a hot fire keeps the coastal chill at bay.|$|R
2500|$|Mrs. Schneider was {{attacked}} {{in the early}} evening hours of August 5, 1918. [...] The 8 months pregnant, 28-year-old of Elmira Street, [...] awoke to find a dark figure standing over her, and was bashed in the face repeatedly. [...] Her scalp had been cut open, and her face was completely covered in blood. [...] Mrs. Schneider was discovered after midnight by her husband, Ed Schneider, who was returning late from work. Schneider claimed that she remembered nothing of the attack, and gave birth to a healthy baby girl two days after the incident. Her husband told police that nothing was stolen from the home, besides six or seven dollars that had been in his wallet. [...] The windows and doors of the apartment appear to have not been forced open, and authorities {{came to the conclusion that}} the woman was most likely attacked with a lamp that had been on a <b>nearby</b> <b>table.</b> James Gleason, who police said was an ex-convict, was arrested shortly after Schneider was found. [...] Gleason was later released due to a complete lack of evidence, and stated that he originally ran from authorities because he had so often been arrested. [...] Lead investigators began to publicly speculate that the attack was related to the previous incidents involving Besumer and Maggio.|$|E

He was Jesse Holmes from top to toe; he had the long, gray, ragged beard, the gray clothes of ancient cut, the executioner's look, and the dusty shoes of one who had been called from afar. His eyes were turned fixedly upon Kerner. I shuddered to think that I had invoked him from his assiduous southern duties. I thought of flying, and then I kept my seat, reflecting that many men had escaped his ministrations when it seemed that nothing short of an appointment as Ambassador to Spain could save them from him. I had called my brother Kerner a fool and {{was in danger of}} hell fire. That was nothing; but I would try to save him from Jesse Holmes.|$|E
5000|$|The term spoons {{was coined}} by Christine Miserandino in 2003 {{in her essay}} [...] "The Spoon Theory". The essay {{describes}} a conversation between Miserandino and a friend. The discussion was initiated by a question from the friend in which she asked about what having lupus feels like. The essay then describes the actions of Miserandino who took spoons from <b>nearby</b> <b>tables</b> {{to use as a}} visual aid. She handed her friend twelve spoons and asked her to describe the events of a typical day, taking a spoon away for each activity. In this way, she demonstrated that her spoons, or units of energy, must be rationed to avoid running out {{before the end of the}} day. Miserandino also asserted that it is possible to exceed one's daily limit, but that doing so means borrowing from the future and may result in not having enough spoons the next day. Miserandino suggested the spoon theory can describe the effects of mental illnesses as well.|$|R

50|$|Along {{with the}} Muskie Derby, is the Fort Kent Ploye Festival. One of the {{featured}} events is {{the making of}} the worlds largest ploye. This event attracts hundreds of spectators, making it the highlight of the Ploye Festival. The massive ploye, which thus far, measures 12 feet in diameter, can only be accomplished with the help of friends and family of Bouchard Family Farm, producers or the ploye mix. It requires approximately fifteen bags of charcoal to ready the metal pan to the accurate temperature in order for the ploye to be cooked to perfection. It also needs about fifty pounds of ploye mix, lots of water (which is than mixed in five gallon pails) and plenty of muscle for stirring the mix. Five people are required to transport the mix from the pails to the awaiting pre-heated pan and also four people to spread the mix out as fast as possible. The thin batter cooks quickly, so time is of the essence. Once cooked, the enormous pan is then removed from the coals, and the ploye is taken off with huge spatulas. Pieces of the giant ploye are then plopped onto large trays and brought to <b>nearby</b> <b>tables</b> where they can be buttered with brushes, and distributed to the eagerly awaiting crowd.|$|R
