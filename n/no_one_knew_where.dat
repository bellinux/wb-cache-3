5|$|The French army {{experienced}} {{a variety of}} command problems, especially in its early operations in southwestern Germany. After the defeat at Stockach, the army withdrew into the Black Forest. Jourdan relinquished command provisionally to Ernouf, who was a capable staff officer but had insufficient experience to hold together a varied and demoralized force. Jourdan retired to Strasbourg, where he was, or claimed he was, indisposed. By the time Masséna arrived to take command, organization and discipline was in shambles. Only four divisional generals had remained at their posts: Klein, Ferino, Souham, and Vandamme. Decaen was under arrest in Strasbourg, pending a Courts-martial, as was d'Hautpoul, for his failure to organize a timely cavalry attack at Stockach. The others had disappeared to {{different parts of the}} southwest or had gone to France. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> Bernadotte had gone, and Saint Cyr had retired to Mannheim. The latter was at least reachable. Lecourbe, who had been injured at Stockach, had withdrawn to Paris to recover; in a strategically astute move, he remained there until late November, when he was able to offer Napoleon direct assistance in his coup, and thus acquired Bonaparte's attention and gratitude.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this {{productive}} period of research, {{in the summer of}} 1934, prior to the eventual invention of nylon, that Carothers disappeared. He did not come into work, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> he was. He was found in a small psychiatric clinic, Pinel Clinic, near the famous Phipps Clinic associated with Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Apparently, he had become so depressed that he drove to Baltimore to consult a psychiatrist, who put him in the clinic.|$|E
500|$|In 1971 the Philadelphia Flyers {{were looking}} for a new coach, and general manager Keith Allen {{suggested}} Shero to owner Ed Snider. When asked if he knew Shero, Allen admitted to only knowing him by reputation. He knew Shero always had a winning record, plus he had a [...] "gut feeling" [...] he was the right man for the job. Snider agreed to bring in Shero because he trusted Allen's judgment. Thus Shero became the third coach in Flyers history; he had high hopes for the Season predicting that the Flyers would finish no worse than second in the West Division. The 1971–72 season was disappointing for Shero as the Flyers finished in 5th place in the West with a 26–38–14 record. The Flyers 66 points were actually a decrease of 7 points in the standings and they missed the playoffs {{for the second time in}} three years. Shero's [...] "Fog" [...] nickname was also re-established during the year following a game at the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta when he left the arena through a door with no re-entry and became locked outside prior to the post-game press conference. At the press conference <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> Shero was and reporters unsuccessfully searched the arena for him.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to several}} accounts, Captain Marr {{challenged}} the riders, asking something like [...] "What cavalry is that?" [...] These {{would have been}} his last words. Scattered shots were fired as the Union cavalry rode through and Captain Marr fell dead. Some other accounts say he was killed while scouting out a better position for his men a little distance away from their line and do not mention {{a challenge to the}} Union horsemen. Whether he had moved up to challenge the Union riders or to scout out a better position for his company as some accounts suggest, Marr was not in the immediate presence or line of sight of any of his men on the very dark night when he fell in the dense field. Soon, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> he was or what may have happened to him. His body was found in the clover field later in the morning.|$|E
