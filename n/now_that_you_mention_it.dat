She stated that for her, saying [...] "goodbye" [...] is sufficient because it expresses the same well-wishing farewell sentiment. Leil Lowndes {{wrote in her}} 2009book How to Instantly Connect with Anyone that if someone says [...] "have a nice day", the recipient should refrain from sarcastically responding [...] "Thanks, but I have other plans" [...] or [...] "Gee, I was planning on having a miserable one, but <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> I think I'll have a nice one."

"Why, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> it," [...] I answered, [...] "I {{have some}} vague {{impression}} that the mystery is connected with some incident which occurred in that country. I am sure, however, that your fears would vanish if you saw Ram Singh. He is the very personification of wisdom and benevolence. He was shocked {{at the idea of}} our killing a sheep, or even a fish for his benefit--said he would rather die than have a hand in taking the life of an animal." ...|$|R

"It is a pity she was out," [...] said Miss Panney, carelessly, [...] "and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have <b>mentioned</b> Miss Bannister, I {{would like}} to ask you something; why does not your sister return her visits? I saw Dora not very long ago, and found that her {{feelings}} had been a little hurt--not much, perhaps, but a little--by Miriam's apparent indifference to her. Dora is a very sensitive girl, and is slow to make friends among other girls. I never knew any friendship so quick and lively as that she showed for Miriam. <b>You</b> know <b>that</b> Dora is still young; it has not been long since she left school; there is not a girl in Thorbury that she cares anything about, and her life at home must necessarily be a lonely one. Her brother is busy, even in the evenings, and Mrs. Bannister is no companion for a lively young girl." ...|$|R

60|$|I hadn't that in mind, but <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> {{it seems}} to the point. That heart of yours isn't going to carry you much farther.

It was the servant who {{accompanied}} me whom I sent off, but, as de Tulle would have been notified of my arrival, and the man started from the baron's house, it would be deemed certain that he was either going to Pointdexter or my own estate, and that the message he carried was a somewhat urgent one. Well, {{all we can do}} is to hope that the fellow has not thought of our taking such a precaution, and that my messenger will arrive unmolested. Still, I acknowledge that the idea makes me anxious, and I fear that we shall not get through without serious trouble. There are so many disbanded soldiers, and other knaves, in the forests that de Tulle would have no difficulty in hiring any number of them, and carrying his scheme out without the assistance or knowledge of his own tenants. The heavy taxation necessary to keep up the expenses of the court has driven numbers of people to despair, and many hitherto law-abiding folk are being forced to leave their holdings, and to take to unlawful courses.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the release}} of the 2017 film Logan, Liev Schreiber {{confirmed}} via twitter that he had personally been invited back by Hugh Jackman for the project during the movie's development. Writer Scott Frank revealed that early versions of the script included the character, but that the element was removed from the final screenplay. Elaborating on the character's role, he stated [...] "There was a moment when we were thinking about, as I recall, Jim Mangold had an idea where when they were on the run, and they go to the gambling town, there may have been at that point they were going to see Sabretooth for help. He was {{going to be there for}} help. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it!</b> I wouldn't swear to it, but we thought that would have been an interesting thing to do. And then for whatever reason we didn't do it." [...] Director James Mangold explained the decision to cut certain characters from the screenplay, stating [...] "There were times early on in the story where I played with the idea of Hugh coming along, and I don't want to give away anything, but I played with there being an underground railroad where there were a couple of other mutants that he met on the journey. It always seemed to detract from the loneliness of the story though and became a kind of cameo." [...] Schreiber later elaborated [...] "There was an invitation early on from Hugh (and director James Mangold) and I would have loved to work on it. It was very difficult given Ray Donovan’s schedule, and I think they went a different direction as well with story." ...|$|E
40|$|Amber Whittaker {{went to see}} {{her family}} {{physician}} about a sore throat. Amber, 19, and her family have been patients of Dr Christine Nowak for 15 years. The Whittakers and Dr Nowak {{are members of the}} same evangelical church, Riverwood Community Church, and they have grown to be friends over the past few years. Dr Nowak examined Amber, performed a rapid strep test, which was positive, and informed her that she had a streptococcal pharyngitis. “Try not to kiss any boys this week, ” Dr Nowak said with a smile. “Actually, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> ” Amber said, “that’s something I wanted to ask you about. My boyfriend and I have been together {{for more than a year}} now, and we’ve been talking seriously about marriage. ” “That’s great! I’m glad to hear things are going well, ” Dr Nowak said. “Well, that’s not all: we feel we’re ready to start having sex, and I need to ask you to write me a prescription for birth control pills. ” Dr Nowak paused for a moment, then explained, “You know, Amber, I appreciate you sharing this with me, but I imagine you know how I feel about premarital sex. As your doctor, friend, and fellow Christian, I think this is an unwise decision, and I can’t in good conscience help you do something I think is wrong. ” “But doctor, we’ve both thought about it, and we love each other, so why put it off any longer?” “As a physician, ” Dr Nowak replied, “I’m committed to doing what’s in my patients’ best interest. And I believe, based on the Scriptures we both read and on our common understanding of God’s nature and purposes for us, that sex is the consummation of a spiritual union between husband and wife. Sex is created by God to be enjoyed in the context of marriage, and saving it for that moment makes it all the more special. I realize that’s difficult, and it’s not what our culture at large believes. But if we call ourselves Christians, we need to carry our beliefs into every aspect of our identity? including something as personal as our sexuality. ...|$|E
