40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} detecting multiple delaminations in composite laminates using <b>non-contact</b> phased arrays. The phased arrays are implemented with a <b>non-contact</b> scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (SLDV). The array imaging algorithm is performed in the frequency domain where both the guided wave dispersion effect and direction dependent wave properties are considered. By using the <b>non-contact</b> SLDV array with a frequency domain imaging algorithm, an intensity image of the composite plate can be generated for delamination detection. For the proof of concept, a laboratory test is performed using a <b>non-contact</b> phased array to detect two delaminations (created through quasi-static impact test) at different locations in a composite plate. Using the <b>non-contact</b> phased array and frequency domain imaging, the two impact-induced delaminations are successfully detected.

40|$|Background: Several authors {{believe it}} is {{necessary}} to randomise the order in which contact and <b>non-contact</b> tonometers are used in comparison studies. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of repeated applanation on the measured intraocular pressure. Methods: One set of measurements per session was made on each of three sessions (one session per day) with the Goldmann and two <b>non-contact</b> tonometers (Topcon CT 80 and Keeler Pulsair EasyEye), in a pre-determined order, on one randomly selected eye of 120 subjects randomised to one of two groups. For session one, only the <b>non-contact</b> tonometers were used to assess the intraocular pressure of both groups. For session two, either <b>non-contact</b> or Goldmann tonometry was performed first and this order was reversed for session 3. Average intraocular pressures were compared between sessions to determine {{the presence or absence of}} effects on the intraocular pressure caused by prior repeated applanation with the Goldmann or either one (or both) of the <b>non-contact</b> tonometers. Results: Prior applanation with a <b>non-contact</b> tonometer did not cause a significant (p > 0. 05) reduction of the mean pressure measured with either <b>non-contact</b> tonometer. The mean pressure was slightly but significantly (p 0. 05) between the pressures measured with the Goldmann tonometer prior to and subsequent to <b>non-contact</b> tonometry, in both subject groups.  Conclusion: A small but statistically significant reduction in the intraocular pressure was found following applanation with the Goldmann tonometer but not with either one of two <b>non-contact</b> tonometers...|$|R

40|$|In marine benthic communities, {{phenotypic}} {{responses to}} contact competition are well resolved, but {{the causes and}} consequences of <b>non-contact</b> competition remain unclear. Here, we used the arborescent bryozoan Bugula neritina to firstly identify whether colonies change their phenotype {{as a result of}} <b>non-contact</b> competition, and then understand the mechanism behind the changes. Secondly, we determined the phenotypes that change in response to <b>non-contact</b> competition, with focus on changes in the feeding structure, viz. the lophophore. Lastly, we used a reciprocal transplant design to test whether phenotypic responses to <b>non-contact</b> competition reduce its negative effects. We found that phenotypic responses to <b>non-contact</b> competition were mediated by the biological effects of conspecific neighbours, but were also determined by the physical effects associated with increased density. Further, we found that colonies grown in high conspecific density environments were smaller (though more elongated for their size) and had smaller lophophores than colonies from low conspecific density treatments. However, we found no evidence that such phenotypic responses constituted adaptive plasticity; instead, individuals that experienced <b>non-contact</b> competition always performed worse than individuals that had not, and the effects of exposure to <b>non-contact</b> competition were additive. Our study suggests that <b>non-contact</b> competition is an important and persistent process in benthic marine communities, but that phenotypic plasticity, though present, does not buffer individuals from the negative effects of this process...|$|R

50|$|Since the {{measuring}} cable may sag or be deflected by wind or gravity, the overall precision {{of a string}} potentiometer measurement is limited.

50|$|Around the 1970s {{the primary}} breaker points were largely {{replaced}} with a Hall effect sensor or optical sensor. As this is a <b>non-contacting</b> device and the ignition coil is controlled by solid state electronics, {{a great amount of}} maintenance in point adjustment and replacement was eliminated. This also eliminates any problem with breaker follower or cam wear, and by eliminating a side load it extends distributor shaft bearing life. The remaining secondary (high voltage) circuit stayed essentially the same, using an ignition coil and a rotary distributor.|$|E
50|$|Dry {{gas seals}} are <b>non-contacting,</b> dry-running {{mechanical}} face seals that {{consist of a}} mating (rotating) ring and a primary (stationary) ring. When operating, lifting geometry in the rotating ring generates a fluid-dynamic lifting force causing the stationary ring to separate and create {{a gap between the}} two rings. Dry gas seals are mechanical seals but use other chemicals and functions so that they do not contaminate a process. These seals are typically used in a harsh working environment such as oil exploration, extraction and refining, petrochemical industries, gas transmission and chemical processing.|$|E

50|$|A special case, called stereophotogrammetry, {{involves}} {{estimating the}} three-dimensional coordinates of points on an object employing measurements made {{in two or}} more photographic images taken from different positions (see stereoscopy). Common points are identified on each image. A line of sight (or ray) can be constructed from the camera location to the point on the object. It is the intersection of these rays (triangulation) that determines the three-dimensional location of the point. More sophisticated algorithms can exploit other information about the scene that is known a priori, for example symmetries, in some cases allowing reconstructions of 3-D coordinates from only one camera position. Stereophotogrammetry is emerging as a robust <b>non-contacting</b> measurement technique to determine dynamic characteristics and mode shapes of non-rotating and rotating structures.|$|E
50|$|Hall effect devices (when {{appropriately}} packaged) are {{immune to}} dust, dirt, mud, and water. These characteristics make Hall effect devices better for position sensing than alternative means such as optical and electromechanical sensing.When electrons flow through a conductor, {{a magnetic field}} is produced. Thus, {{it is possible to}} create a <b>non-contacting</b> current sensor. The device has three terminals.A sensor voltage is applied across two terminals and the third provides a voltage proportional to the current being sensed. This has several advantages; no additional resistance (a shunt, required for the most common current sensing method) need be inserted in the primary circuit. Also, the voltage present on the line to be sensed is not transmitted to the sensor, which enhances the safety of measuring equipment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Non-contact</b> mode AFM {{does not}} suffer from tip or sample {{degradation}} effects that are sometimes observed after taking numerous scans with contact AFM. This makes <b>non-contact</b> AFM preferable to contact AFM for measuring soft samples, e.g. biological samples and organic thin film. In {{the case of}} rigid samples, contact and <b>non-contact</b> images may look the same. However, if a few monolayers of adsorbed fluid are lying {{on the surface of}} a rigid sample, the images may look quite different. An AFM operating in contact mode will penetrate the liquid layer to image the underlying surface, whereas in <b>non-contact</b> mode an AFM will oscillate above the adsorbed fluid layer to image both the liquid and surface.|$|R
50|$|A Hydrostatic Seal is a <b>non-contacting</b> {{mechanical}} seal that operates under an equilibrium of forces. Unlike traditional hydrodynamic seals, Hydrostatic seals have two different pressure zones {{that are used}} to establish a balanced pressure zone between two seal faces. The two pressure system makes the seal unique because typical {{mechanical seal}}s have one pressure zone that created causes a buildup of pressure that will eventually cause the seal to malfunction. After pressure has come to an equilibrium at the seal face, an incompressible fluid is then released between the two seal faces. The fluid creates a film around the seal face that acts as a lubricant and as a medium for the substance flowing through the seal. Hydrostatic seals have been used in the aircraft industry; however they have seen very little commercial use because there is minimal research about the seals.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic {{generators}} {{can provide}} power {{at more than}} 4 times the conversion efficiency of RTGs. NASA and DOE have been developing a next-generation radioisotope-fueled power source called the Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG) that uses free-piston Stirling engines coupled to linear alternators to convert heat to electricity. SRG prototypes demonstrated an average efficiency of 23%. Greater efficiency {{can be achieved by}} increasing the temperature ratio between the hot and cold ends of the generator. The use of <b>non-contacting</b> moving parts, non-degrading flexural bearings, and a lubrication-free and hermetically sealed environment have, in test units, demonstrated no appreciable degradation over years of operation. Experimental results demonstrate that an SRG could continue running for decades without maintenance. Vibration can be eliminated as a concern by implementation of dynamic balancing or use of dual-opposed piston movement. Potential applications of a Stirling radioisotope power system include exploration and science missions to deep-space, Mars, and the Moon.|$|E
50|$|One simple {{solution}} is to put {{a gap between the}} commutator plates which is wider than the ends of the brushes. This increases the zero-torque range of angular positions but eliminates the shorting problem; if the motor is started spinning by an outside force it will continue spinning. With this modification, it can also be effectively turned off simply by stalling (stopping) it in a position in the zero-torque (i.e. commutator <b>non-contacting)</b> angle range. This design is sometimes seen in homebuilt hobby motors, e.g. for science fairs and such designs can be found in some published science project books. A clear downside of this {{simple solution}} is that the motor now coasts through a substantial arc of rotation twice per revolution and the torque is pulsed. This may work for electric fans or to keep a flywheel spinning but there are many applications, even where starting and stopping are not necessary, for which it is completely inadequate, such as driving the capstan of a tape transport, or any instance where to speed up and slow down often and quickly is a requirement. Another disadvantage is that, since the coils have a measure of self inductance, current flowing in them cannot suddenly stop. The current attempts to jump the opening gap between the commutator segment and the brush, causing arcing.|$|E
