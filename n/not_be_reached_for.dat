2500|$|In October 2010 the Hells Angels filed {{a lawsuit}} against Alexander McQueen for [...] "misusing its {{trademark}} winged death heads symbol" [...] in several items from its Autumn/Winter 2010 collection. The lawsuit is also aimed at Saks Fifth Avenue and Zappos.com, which stock the jacquard box dress and knuckle duster ring that bear the symbol, which has been used since at least 1948 and is protected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A handbag and scarf was also named in lawsuit. The lawyer representing Hells Angels claimed [...] "This isn't just about money, it's about membership. If you've got one of these rings on, a member might get really upset that you're an impostor." [...] Saks refused to comment, Zappos had no immediate comment and the company's parent company, PPR, could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> comment.

It was an epistle of considerable length, measuring five large square pages, and written at Philadelphia. It was an explanatory document, and it explained a great many things, chief among which were the considerations that had led the writer to take advantage of an urgent [...] "professional" [...] absence to try and banish from his mind the image of one whose path he had crossed only to scatter it with ruins. He ventured to expect but partial success in this attempt, but he could promise her that, whatever his failure, he would never again interpose between her generous heart and her brilliant prospects and filial duties. He closed with an intimation that his professional pursuits might compel him to travel for some months, and with the hope that when they should each have accommodated themselves to what was sternly involved in their respective positions--even should this result <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> years--they should meet as friends, as fellow-sufferers, as innocent but philosophic victims of a great social law. That her life should be peaceful and happy was the dearest wish of him who ventured still to subscribe himself her most obedient servant. The letter was beautifully written, and Catherine, who kept it for many years after this, was able, when her sense of the bitterness of its meaning and the hollowness of its tone had grown less acute, to admire its grace of expression. At present, {{for a long time after}} she received it, all she had to help her was the determination, daily more rigid, to make no appeal to the compassion of her father.|$|E

40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells with full ceramic anodes have {{recently}} attracted increasing attention, because the conventional Ni/YSZ cermet anodes may fail during practical operation {{due to their}} weak mechanical stability {{in the case of}} re-oxidation of the nickel. However, until now the reported fuel cells based on ceramic anodes have been fabricated only as small pellet-sized cells and electrochemical performance has been barely satisfactory, making it difficult to evaluate these attempts with respect to commercial feasibility.

These planar cells have outer dimensions of 50 x 50 mm(2), which has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> a ceramic anode-supported cell before.

Bacteria contaminant of in vitro plants were isolated directly from visibly contaminated plant culture on Tryptone soy agar medium and some drops of sugarcane cell suspension contaminated were inoculated on tubes with 3 ml of Tryptone Soy Broth (TSB). Isolated bacteria were examined microscopically (shape, motility) and some biochemical test (Gram´s stain (Hucker´s modification), oxidase, catalase, O/F (oxidation/fermentation), were performed. Additional tests, according to Bergey´s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, were performed. Identification was complemented by fatty acid analysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Electron {{beam melting}} (E-beam) {{is a new}} {{technology}} to produce 3 -dimensional surface topographies for cementless orthopedic implants. METHODS: The friction coefficients of two newly developed E-beam produced surface topographies were in vitro compared with sandblasted E-beam and titanium plasma sprayed controls. Bone ingrowth (direct bone-implant contact) was determined by implanting the samples in the femoral condyles of 6 goats {{for a period of}} 6 weeks. RESULTS: Friction coefficients of the new structures were comparable to the titanium plasma sprayed control. The direct bone-implant contact was 23. 9 and 24. 5 % for the new surface structures. Bone-implant contact of the sandblasted and titanium plasma sprayed control was 18. 2 and 25. 5 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The frictional and bone ingrowth properties of the E-beam produced surface structures are similar to the plasma-sprayed control. However, since the maximal bone ingrowth had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> the E-beam structures during the relatively short-term period, longer-term follow-up studies are needed to assess whether the E-beam structures lead to a better long-term performance than surfaces currently in use, such as titanium plasma spray coating...|$|R
