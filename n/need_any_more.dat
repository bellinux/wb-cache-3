25|$|For {{years the}} band consented to very few {{interviews}} and have only {{made a few}} music videos, citing {{the fact that it}} does not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> exposure and that people were exploiting the group. In recent years, Fat Mike has consented to more interviews, including six different interviews with Nardwuar between 2002 and 2011. The band has also refused permission for its music videos to be broadcast on MTV, VH1, and similar music channels, although its music has been played on Canada's Much Music. NOFX made a live appearance on NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the middle}} of this final section Rousseau reasons that the theatre does very little good for the poor, who cannot afford the taxes {{required}} to support a theatre. Geneva, which already has a large degree of inequality, does not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>more.</b> Rousseau continues to say that actors coming to the town of Geneva will be indifferent to the town's morality, and will quickly corrupt it. Even though there are other forms of entertainment in Geneva that exemplify bad manners, Rousseau claims that none of these areas are more destructive to the people's good taste than the theatre. The best alternative to theatres is open-air festivals, in nature, to provide a unifying, patriotic spirit.|$|E
25|$|Once in New York, Tallchief {{looked up}} Serge Denham. A {{secretary}} {{told her that}} the company did not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> dancers and she left crying. A few days later, she was told there was a place for her after all. Denham did not actually remember her, but she had something he needed– a passport. Many of his dancers were Russian émigrés who lacked passports and the troupe had a Canadian tour coming up. Based on a combination of her talent and her passport, Tallchief was taken on as an apprentice. Her first performance was in Gaîté Parisienne. After the Canadian tour, one of the dancers left the troupe due to pregnancy and Tallchief was offered the woman's place and a $40 per week salary.|$|E

500|$|The {{price of}} the album was just one dollar above what is paid for a regular single-disc CD, as Grohl thought the albums [...] "complemented each other in one package, and I don't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> money". The first 25,000 US copies were in a special edition DualDisc set {{containing}} a [...] "making of" [...] documentary in the first disc, and the second disc in 5.1 surround sound. RCA also issued limited 5,000 copies of a quadruple vinyl LP record. Distributor Sony BMG issued the album with the copy protection software MediaMax CD-3, which later lead to a scandal as its rootkit-like nature made [...] computers vulnerable to malware.|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, Tricky Stewart told MTV that he {{was back}} in the studio with Perry working on {{leftovers}} from their Teenage Dream sessions. He stated: [...] "Katy and I went into [...] just to address some issues with [...] records that we had done in the past that didn't end up going on , so {{we are in the process}} of just listening and freshening up things and getting ready for something special she has going on", hinting that Teenage Dream would have a re-release. Stewart also added: [...] "We always knew that the records we created were special [...] at the time it was more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> records, as you can tell by the success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. She has a very keen musical taste. It'll be really good".|$|E
500|$|Paul McCartney is {{credited}} as providing [...] "celery and carrot" [...] {{on the track}} [...] "Receptacle for the Respectable". McCartney {{is alleged to have}} performed a similar role over thirty years earlier, chewing celery to form the percussion track of The Beach Boys song [...] "Vegetables" [...] from the album Smiley Smile. The Super Furry Animals had met the ex-Beatle at the NME Awards when a drunk Ciaran persuaded him to let them remix some Beatles material, resulting in 2000's Liverpool Sound Collage album. The band asked him to [...] "return the favour" [...] and appear on Rings Around the World, recording his part over the phone. Huw Bunford has said of McCartney's contribution: [...] "He took it with good nature. You kind of see how far you can go sometimes ... we figured we already had a bass and singers so we really didn't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> musicians. So we figured he could crunch vegetables". [...] Former Velvet Underground member John Cale, a [...] "sort of childhood hero" [...] of Rhys's, also makes an appearance on the album, playing piano on the song [...] "Presidential Suite". The Super Furry Animals had met Cale in Cardiff when they acted as his backing band for a song which appeared on the film Beautiful Mistake. They originally asked him to arrange strings for [...] "Presidential Suite" [...] but Cale turned them down reasoning that he would simply do what the band do: hum a melody to someone who could write the music down for him.|$|E

50|$|A {{function}} {{in almost every}} city was drainage. Rainwater flowed through these city-canals. Usually they were also used as a sewer. Because these functions are not <b>needed</b> <b>any</b> <b>more,</b> many grachten have been filled in to give access to road traffic. However, these new streets have mostly retained {{the names of the}} grachts and singels they covered or replaced.|$|R

2500|$|In 1995, the Aboriginal Flag and the Torres Strait Islander Flag {{were also}} {{appointed}} flags of Australia. While mainly {{seen as a}} gesture of reconciliation, this recognition caused a small amount of controversy at the time, with then opposition leader John Howard describing it as divisive. Some indigenous people, such as the flag's designer Harold Thomas, felt that the government was appropriating their flag, saying it [...] "doesn't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> recognition".|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} in 1995 by Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags {{should be given}} the status of national flags was opposed by the Liberal Opposition at the time, Opposition Leader John Howard stating that [...] "any attempt to give the flags official status under the Flags Act would rightly be seen by many in the community not as an act of reconciliation but as a divisive gesture". Nonetheless, since Howard became Prime Minister in 1996 and under subsequent Labor governments, these flags have remained national flags. However, this decision was differently criticised by Thomas himself, who said that the Aboriginal flag [...] "doesn't <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> recognition".|$|E
2500|$|He also said, [...] "Victims of rape {{are victims}} of an {{extremely}} violent act, and mine is not a violent God. Do we <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> proof that Richard Mourdock is an extremist who’s {{out of touch with}} Hoosiers?" [...] The day after the debate, Mourdock issued a statement saying, [...] "God creates life, and that was my point. God does not want rape, and by no means was I suggesting that he does. Rape is a horrible thing, and for anyone to twist my words otherwise is absurd and sick." [...] He later said at a press conference, [...] "I believe God controls the universe. I don't believe biology works in an uncontrolled fashion." [...] The controversy likely contributed to Mourdock's loss to Representative Joe Donnelly, and Tom LoBianco of Associated Press' The Big Story commented upon the similarities to Akin's comments.|$|E

[...] She had not paid any {{business}} rates on the gallery for a year, and was expecting the arrival of bailiffs. The proceeds of Charles Saatchi's 2004 purchase of Vine's painting Hi Paul Can You Come Over went to the council bailiff. Islington London Borough Council gave Rosy Wilde an additional month's grace to pay the outstanding debts after they {{had heard of the}} Saatchi's purchase. Vine was [...] "bombarded" [...] with phone calls from galleries wanting to show her work and from art collectors seeking {{to cash in on the}} [...] "Saatchi effect"; within a week she had sold six paintings. Saatchi also bought more work from her. Vine said, [...] "I can paint and pay the bills. I don’t <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> than that." ...|$|E

50|$|Early {{aeroplane}} engines {{had little}} power and light weight was very important. Also, early aerofoil sections were very thin, {{and could not}} have strong frame installed within. So until the 1930s most wings were too light weight to have enough strength and external bracing struts and wires were added. When the available engine power increased during the 1920s and 1930s, wings could be made heavy and strong enough that bracing was not <b>needed</b> <b>any</b> <b>more.</b> This type of unbraced wing is called a cantilever wing.|$|R

I forgot to tell you that the old man had died, poor old feller, maybe six months before, so that now Andy was the real boss instead of just acting boss; and what's more, in the nature of things, he was, in a manner of speaking, Katie's guardian, with power to tell her what she could do and what she couldn't. And I felt that Katie wasn't going to have any smooth passage with this stage {{business}} which she was giving him. Andy didn't hold with the stage--not with any girl he was fond of being on it anyway. And when Andy didn't like a thing he said so.|$|E

No need now to stand up for twenty miles on a hot day; and more cars are building, and more engines; likewise some rates have been lowered.
