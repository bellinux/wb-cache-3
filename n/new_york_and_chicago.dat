5|$|Born in Bagheria, Sicily, {{to father}} Carlo Sr., Aiello {{was part of}} a large and impoverished family of at least nine other {{brothers}} and multiple cousins. His mother died when he was a child. In July 1907, at age 17, Aiello emigrated to the United States to join family members already residing there. After arriving in New York City by boat, he worked a series of menial jobs in Buffalo and Utica, New York, before connecting with his father, brothers and cousins in Chicago. The family set up several businesses in both <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chicago,</b> including the financially successful Aiello Brothers Bakery, and they become importers of such groceries as olive oil, cheeses and sugar.|$|E
5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chicago</b> this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special water-tight boxes called caissons were invented {{to deal with this}} problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> St. Louis Railway was the positive economic impact on cities that any new railroad went through at that time. During a newspaper war to attract the <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> St. Louis the Norwalk, Ohio Chronicle Newspaper referred to the <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> St. Louis as [...] "... double-track nickel-plated railroad." [...] The <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>and</b> St. Louis adopted the nickname and it became better known as the Nickel Plate Road.|$|R

5|$|In 1952, the Icelandic airline Loftleidir {{was granted}} the {{concession}} to fly from Keflavík Airport outside Reykjavík to <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chicago</b> in the United States, and to Oslo, Copenhagen and London. The company established a hub at Keflavík. Braathens SAFE and Loftleidir {{made an agreement}} where Braathens SAFE would lease personnel and mechanical services to Loftleidir, and the two would split profits from the joint venture evenly. This allowed the two airlines to have a continual route between Hong Kong and New York as long as Braathens SAFE's concession lasted. In 1954, another DC-4, LN-HHK, was bought. This aircraft was sold to Loftleidir the following year. In 1956, another DC-4, LN-SUP, was bought, and used for charter and by Loftleidir. In 1959 and 1960, Loftleidir received two new Douglas DC-6B aircraft, with a five-year mechanical agreement with Braathens SAFE. In 1960, the two companies agreed to terminate the cooperation from 1 January 1961.|$|E
5|$|Skyscrapers {{continued}} to spread both across the U.S. and internationally. <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chicago</b> remained {{the center of}} skyscraper development, but most major cities in the U.S. had built skyscrapers by 1929, frequently {{as a result of}} competition between rival cities for status and investment. Cincinnati built the Cincinnati Towers in 1914, followed by the Carew Tower Complex in 1930. In Detroit, the General Motors Building opened in 1920 and the Fisher Building in 1928. Cleveland acquired the Union Trust Building in 1923 and the Terminal Tower in 1929; the latter, built by the Van Sweringen brothers, was, for a short period, the second tallest building in the world. Seattle had built Smith Tower in 1914, and the Los Angeles local government granted itself an exemption from city planning restrictions in order to build the Los Angeles City Hall in 1928. In 1928, the Industrial Trust Tower was built in Providence.|$|E

25|$|Aside from steel, Pittsburgh has led in {{manufacturing}} of aluminum, glass, shipbuilding, petroleum, foods, sports, transportation, computing, autos, and electronics. For {{part of the}} 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chicago</b> in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita. America's 1980s deindustrialization laid off area blue-collar workers and thousands of downtown white-collar workers when the longtime Pittsburgh-based world headquarters moved out. This heritage left the area with renowned museums, medical centers, parks, research centers, libraries, a diverse cultural district and the most bars per capita in the U.S.|$|E

25|$|A {{small town}} in northwestern Pennsylvania, Cambridge Springs seems like an {{unlikely}} location to hold an international chess tournament. However, {{back in the early}} 1900s Cambridge Springs was a flourishing resort town due to a couple geographic oddities. The primary factor was location. At first glance nothing seems remarkable about the town, but in fact it is located on the Erie Railroad line, halfway between <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chicago,</b> which made it an ideal stopover location for railway patrons. The secondary factor was the local mineral springs which were visited by numerous people seeking to improve their health.|$|E
