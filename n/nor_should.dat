5|$|The work of Krafft-Ebing and Ellis {{was widely}} read, {{and helped to}} create public {{consciousness}} of female homosexuality. The sexologists' claims that homosexuality was a congenital anomaly were generally well-accepted by homosexual men; it indicated that their behavior was not inspired by <b>nor</b> <b>should</b> be considered a criminal vice, as was widely acknowledged. In {{the absence of any}} other material to describe their emotions, homosexuals accepted the designation of different or perverted, and used their outlaw status to form social circles in Paris and Berlin. Lesbian began to describe elements of a subculture.|$|E
5|$|These {{decisions}} give {{support to}} a current mistaken {{view of the}} Constitution and the constitutional function of this court. This view, in short, is that every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this court should {{take the lead in}} promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare <b>nor</b> <b>should</b> this court, ordained as a judicial body, {{be thought of as a}} general haven of reform movements.|$|E

25|$|White Merlot {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the grape variety Merlot blanc, which is a cross between Merlot and Folle blanche that was discovered in 1891, <b>nor</b> <b>should</b> it be confused with the white mutant variety of the Merlot grape.|$|E

25|$|He contrasted Durkheim with Weber's {{approach}} — interpretative sociology — {{focused on}} understanding agency and motives of individuals. Giddens {{is closer to}} Weber than Durkheim, but in his analysis he rejects both of those approaches, stating that while society is not a collective reality, <b>nor</b> <b>should</b> the individual be treated as the central unit of analysis.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{venlafaxine}} {{in children}} have not established its efficacy. Venlafaxine {{is not recommended}} in patients hypersensitive to it, <b>nor</b> <b>should</b> it be taken by anyone who is allergic to the inactive ingredients, which include gelatin, cellulose, ethylcellulose, iron oxide, titanium dioxide and hypromellose. It {{should not be used}} in conjunction with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), as it can cause potentially fatal serotonin syndrome.|$|E

25|$|The report {{stated that}} while some {{witnesses}} {{pointed out that the}} level of antisemitism experienced by Jews in Britain is lower than that faced by Jewish communities in some other parts of Europe and that the Jewish community is not the only minority community in Britain to experience prejudice and discrimination, that these arguments, provided no comfort to victims of hate and violence, <b>nor</b> <b>should</b> they be used as an excuse to ignore the problem.|$|E

25|$|<b>Nor</b> <b>should</b> the {{contribution}} of Swami Muktananda be overlooked. While himself not belonging to the direct lineage of Kashmir Shaivism, Muktananda felt a great affinity for the teachings which were validated by his own direct experience. He encouraged and endorsed Motilal Banarsidass to publish Jaideva Singh's translations of Shiva Sutras, Pratyabhijnahrdayam, Spanda Karikas and Vijnana Bhairava. He also introduced Kashmir Shaivism to a wide audience of western meditators through his writings and lectures on the subject.|$|E

25|$|Meteotsunami {{should not}} be {{confused}} with storm surges, which are local increases in sea level associated with the low barometric pressure of passing tropical cyclones, <b>nor</b> <b>should</b> they be confused with setup, the temporary local raising of sea level caused by strong on-shore winds. Storm surges and setup are also dangerous causes of coastal flooding in severe weather but their dynamics are completely unrelated to tsunami waves. They are unable to propagate beyond their sources, as waves do.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. and Pakistani {{government}}s did {{not agree}} as to Davis's legal status in Pakistan {{at the time of}} his arrest. The U.S. government claimed that Davis was a diplomat and should neither have been arrested <b>nor</b> <b>should</b> be prosecuted under Pakistani law because he had diplomatic immunity under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The Punjab authorities (the province in which Davis was arrested) claimed that Davis was not on a diplomatic visa but on an official business visa.|$|E

The flag {{is not to be}} placed or dropped on the ground, <b>nor</b> <b>should</b> it be used to cover an object in the lead-up to an unveiling ceremony, or to hide other material. Flags that have decayed or faded should not be displayed.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{theories}} of magic treat magic {{as a personal}} phenomenon intended to meet individual needs, {{as opposed to a}} social phenomenon serving a collective purpose. The explanatory power of magic should not be underestimated, however. Both in the past and in the modern world, magical belief systems can provide explanations for otherwise difficult or impossible to understand phenomena while providing a spiritual and metaphysical grounding for the individual. Furthermore, as both Brian Feltham and Scott E. Hendrix argue, magical beliefs need not represent a form of irrationality, <b>nor</b> <b>should</b> they be viewed as incompatible with modern views of the world.|$|E

While the men of 'D' Company received this honour, {{the role of the}} other 6 RAR men in this battle should not be understated, <b>nor</b> <b>should</b> the contributions of the various Australian, New Zealand and American artillery units, as well as the bravery of the RAAF helicopter crews that flew through weather that would normally have grounded them to resupply the infantry on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Five {{months after}} {{the demise of the}} daily, a new group of intellectuals started {{publishing}} Nor Haratch. The first issue of Nor Haratch was published on 27 October 2009.
