5|$|Two {{different}} kelly pool-based derivations for {{behind the}} eight ball {{are provided in}} diverse sources. As noted, in kelly pool each player is randomly assigned a specific ball of the fifteen ball rack, which must be made in <b>numerical</b> <b>order.</b> The game ends when any player makes his assigned ball. Based on these rules, one origin theory holds that when {{a large number of}} players are participating, players assigned balls numerically higher than 8that is, balls that are behind the 8 ball in orderhave little chance of winning. This {{is a result of the}} likelihood that random distribution will result in multiple players with assigned balls numbered lower than 8 having an opportunity to shoot first, and that with such large a number of players at least one will come to the table with the opportunity to shoot at his assigned ball.|$|E

25|$|The Dvorak Simplified Keyboard (DSK) layout, {{also known}} as the American Simplified Keyboard (ASK) layout, is the best-known {{alternative}} to QWERTY. It was named after its inventor, August Dvorak. There are also numerous adaptations for languages other than English, and single-handed variants. Dvorak's original layout had the numerals rearranged, but the present-day layout has them in <b>numerical</b> <b>order.</b> The Dvorak Simplified Keyboard has numerous properties designed to increase typing speed, decrease errors, and increase comfort. Research has found a modest 4% average advantage to the end user in typing speed.

An avid stamp collector, Roosevelt suggested a set of stamps that would {{pay tribute to the}} various past American presidents. In 1937, after much debate, a new definitive series was issued using Roosevelt's ideas.

25|$|Braille is in {{its origin}} a numeric code. Louis Braille applied the {{characters}} in <b>numerical</b> <b>order</b> to the French alphabet in alphabetical order. As braille spread to other languages, the numeric order was retained and applied to the local script. Therefore, where the alphabetical order differed from that of French, the new braille alphabet would be incompatible with French Braille. For example, French {{was based on a}} 25-letter alphabet without a w. When braille was adopted for English in the United States, the letters were applied directly to the English alphabet, so that braille letter of French x became English w, French y became English x, French z English y, and French ç English z. In the United Kingdom, however, French Braille was adopted without such reordering. Therefore, any English book published in braille needed to be typeset separately for the United States and the United Kingdom. Similarly, the letters Egyptian Arabic Braille were assigned their forms based on their nearest French equivalents, so that for example Arabic d had the same braille letters as French d. For Algerian Arabic Braille, however, the braille characters were assigned to the Arabic alphabet according to the Arabic alphabetical order, so that Algerian d was the same character as Egyptian h. Thus an Arabic book published in Algeria was utterly unintelligible to blind Egyptians and vice versa.|$|E
