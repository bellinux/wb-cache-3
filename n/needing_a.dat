5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} for the project were scrutinized and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E
5|$|Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based {{gameplay}} is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so {{that players}} {{can go for}} longer periods without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> manual input while an enemy is targeted. Each action uses up a stamina bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold is reached, automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), {{and the number of}} abilities available to them.|$|E
5|$|In 1326 Provost Adam de Brome was {{appointed}} warden of St Bartholomew's; a leper hospital in Cowley Marsh, {{the hospital was}} later granted to the college by Edward III, along with the payments it had been receiving from the fee farm. It was increasingly used as a rest house for sick members of the college <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> change of air. In 1649 the college rebuilt the main hospital range north of the chapel, destroyed in the Civil War, as a row of four almshouses, called Bartlemas House. Bartlemas Chapel and two farm cottages are the other extant buildings.|$|E

Battle of the Decades, a tournament {{conducted}} by the producers of Jeopardy! to celebrate its thirtieth season in syndication. Both men advanced to the two-day tournament final with Roger Craig filling the third position. <b>Needing</b> <b>a</b> win to reclaim his record, Rutter took the top prize in the tournament after Jennings, who needed to answer the second day's Final Jeopardy clue correctly to win (after making a sufficient wager), failed to do so. Rutter won the top prize of $1,000,000 while Jennings won the $100,000 second prize.|$|E
5|$|In {{their regular}} season finale, the Ravens took on their {{division}} rivals, the Cleveland Browns, <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> win and a Chargers loss {{to get into}} the playoffs. Trailing 10-6 in the final quarter, Smith caught a deep pass from Flacco, and on the very next play, a 16-yard touchdown to give Baltimore the lead. Smith finished the game with four receptions for 83 yards, including two decisive fourth quarter plays. Baltimore won and San Diego lost.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> license {{to perform their}} occupation and the poor requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the working environment of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to address these issues.|$|E

5|$|Oil-fired {{propulsion}} {{had many}} advantages for naval architects and officers at sea alike. It reduced smoke, making ships less visible. It could be fed into boilers automatically, rather than <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> complement of stokers {{to do it}} by hand. Oil has roughly twice the thermal content of coal. This meant that the boilers themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired ship would have much greater range.|$|E

She attended University of New South Wales and Sydney University, where she took classes in Cognitive Science, English, and Philosophy.

UT's Brian Robison recovered the fumble at the 30and advanced it nine yards before being tackled by Vernon Gholston at the Ohio State 21.|$|E
5|$|This was {{virtually}} {{the only part}} of the Western Front, during the Phoney War, where there was significant aerial activity in the early months of the war, as RAF bombers flew unescorted raids on the German naval bases. So it did not take long for Specht to score his first victories: two Handley Page Hampden medium bombers in a squadron conducting an armed reconnaissance operation near Heligoland, shot down on 29 September. <b>Needing</b> <b>a</b> long-range fighter to better intercept the British bombers at distance, I./ZG 26 was thus the next Gruppe selected for re-equipping onto the Bf 110.|$|E

You <b>need</b> <b>a</b> core set of courses. You <b>need</b> <b>a</b> minimum of four courses - a minimum - taught by permanent faculty. You <b>need</b> <b>an</b> environmental law survey class. You <b>need</b> <b>a</b> distinct natural resources law survey class. You <b>need</b> <b>a</b> distinct international environmental law class.

5|$|When Johnny Carson, {{a fan of}} jazz music, was {{preparing}} to take over as the permanent host of The Tonight Show starting in October 1962, he recognized that he would need a theme song.

5|$|After the Kansas kickoff, Virginia Tech {{took over}} at its 33-yard line. <b>Needing</b> <b>a</b> score, the Hokies {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty before quarterback Sean Glennon was sacked by Kansas' Mike Rivera. The two plays pushed the Virginia Tech offense back, {{preventing them from}} gaining a first down. Forced to punt the ball away, Virginia Tech had to play defense as Kansas took over at its 28-yard line. Secure in their lead, Kansas elected to run the ball {{in an effort to}} keep the clock moving and bring the game to an end more quickly. Brandon McAnderson broke free for 28yards on the first play of the drive, and Jake Sharp contributed another first down on the ground before the Hokie defense stopped Kansas on an attempt to earn a first down on a fourth-and-two deep inside Virginia Tech territory.|$|E
5|$|In {{qualification}} for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Chamakh {{scored three}} goals. One of his goals during qualification occurred on 8 October 2010 against Tunisia. With Morocco <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> win {{to qualify for}} the World Cup, Chamakh opened the scoring in the third minute. However, the match finished 2–2, which resulted in the team failing {{to qualify for the}} competition. However, the draw did allow Morocco qualification for the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations. In the tournament, Morocco were eliminated in the group stage and departed the tournament without scoring a goal. In 2008, Chamakh was selected to participate in his third consecutive Africa Cup of Nations and was held scoreless in the competition as Morocco were again eliminated in the group stage. In 2009–2010, Chamakh appeared in only four matches and scored no goals as Morocco failed to qualify for both the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.|$|E
