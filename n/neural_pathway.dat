5|$|Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates {{and each}} zooid has {{a pair of}} {{luminescent}} organs {{on either side of}} the inlet siphon. When stimulated by light, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic flashing. No <b>neural</b> <b>pathway</b> runs between the zooids, but each responds to the light produced by other individuals, and even to light from other nearby colonies. Communication by light emission between the zooids enables coordination of colony effort, for example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the propulsive force.|$|E
5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This <b>neural</b> <b>pathway</b> differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to neural mappings neural pathways can connect neural maps which are far apart (e.g. in different cortical lobes, see cerebral cortex). From the functional or modeling viewpoint, neural pathways mainly forward information without processing this information. A <b>neural</b> <b>pathway</b> {{in comparison to}} a neural mapping need much less neural connections. A <b>neural</b> <b>pathway</b> can be modelled by using a one-to-one connection of the neurons of both neural maps (see topographic mapping and see somatotopic arrangement).|$|E

Double arrows indicate neuronal mappings. Neural mappings connect neural maps, which are not far apart from each other (see above).

25|$|Spine {{plasticity}} is {{implicated in}} motivation, learning, and memory.

25|$|Stuttering {{can also}} have its roots in development. Many {{toddlers}} and preschool age children stutter as they are learning to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech as they get older. Since most of these children do not stutter as adults, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as pseudo-stuttering or as a normal disfluency. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Children with a normal disfluency usually have brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words, however, the stuttering usually comes and goes and is most noticeable {{when a child is}} excited, stressed or overly tired. Stuttering is also believed to be caused by neurophysiology. Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the <b>neural</b> <b>pathway</b> regions.|$|E

2500|$|Fear of {{the unknown}} or irrational fear is caused by {{negative}} thinking (worry) which arises from anxiety accompanied with a subjective sense of apprehension or dread. Irrational fear like any other fears share common <b>neural</b> <b>pathway</b> that engages to mobilize bodily resources {{in the face of}} threat. Many people are scared of the [...] "unknown". The irrational fear can branch out to many areas such as the hereafter, the next ten years, or even tomorrow. Chronic irrational fear has deleterious effects since the elicitor stimulus is commonly absent or perceived from delusions. In these cases specialists use False Evidence Appearing Real as a definition. Such fear can create comorbidity with the anxiety disorder umbrella. Being scared may cause people to experience anticipatory fear of what may lie ahead rather than planning and evaluating for the same. E.g. Continuation of scholarly education, most educators perceive this as a risk that may cause them fear and stress and they would rather teach things they've been taught than go and do research, this can lead to habits such as laziness and procrastination. The ambiguity of a situations that tend to be uncertain and unpredictable can cause anxiety, other psychological and physical problems in some populations; especially those who engage it constantly. E.g. War-ridden or Conflict places, Terrorism, Abuse ...etc. Poor parenting that instills fear can also debilitate children's psyche development or personality. E.g. Parents tell their children not to talk to strangers in order to protect them. In school they would be motivated to not show fear in talking with strangers, but to be assertive and also aware of the risks and the environment that it takes place. Ambiguous and mixed messages like this can affect their self-esteem and self-confidence. Researchers say talking to strangers isn't something to be thwarted but allowed in a parent's presence if required. Developing [...] a sense of equanimity to handle various situations is often advocated as an antidote to irrational fear and essential skill by a number of ancient philosophies.|$|E
