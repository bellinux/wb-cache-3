6000|$|Many {{impressions}} of fingers are found on ancient pottery, as on Roman tiles; indeed the Latin word palmatus {{is said to}} mean an impression in soft clay, such as a mark upon a wall, stamped by a blow with the palm. Nail-marks are used ornamentally by potters of various nations. They exist on Assyrian bricks as signatures; for instance, in the Assyrian room of the British Museum, {{on the west side}} of the case C 43, one of these bricks contains a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> and is prefaced by words that were translated for me thus: [...] "Nail-mark of Nabu-sum-usur, the seller of the field, (used) like his seal." [...] A somewhat amusing incident affected the design of the Chinese money during the great Tang dynasty, about 618 A.D. A new and important issue of coinage was to be introduced, and the Secretary of the Censors himself moulded the design in wax, and humbly submitted it to the Empress Wen-teh for approval. She, through maladroitness, dug the end of her enormously long finger-nail into its face, marking it deeply as with a carpenter's gouge. The poor Secretary of the Censors, Ngeu-yang-siun, who deserves honour from professional courtiers, suppressing such sentiments as he must have felt when his work was mauled, accepted the nail-mark of the Empress as an interesting supplement to the design; he changed it into a crescent in relief, and the new coins were stamped accordingly. (See Coins and Medals, edited by Stanley Lane Poole, 1885, p. 221.) A drawing of one of these is given in Plate 1, Fig. 1.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had taken}} up her niece--there was little doubt of that. One wet afternoon, some four months earlier than the {{occurrence}} lately narrated, this young lady had been seated alone with a book. To say she was so occupied {{is to say that}} her solitude did not press upon her; for her love of knowledge had a fertilising quality and her imagination was strong. There was at this time, however, a want of fresh taste in her situation which the arrival of an unexpected visitor did much to correct. The visitor had not been announced; the girl heard her at last walking about the adjoining room. It was in an old house at Albany, a large, square, double house, with a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> in the windows of one of the lower apartments. There were two entrances, one of which had long been out of use but had never been removed. They were exactly alike--large white doors, with an arched frame and wide side-lights, perched upon little [...] "stoops" [...] of red stone, which descended sidewise to the brick pavement of the street. The two houses together formed a single dwelling, the party-wall having been removed and the rooms placed in communication. These rooms, above-stairs, were extremely numerous, and were painted all over exactly alike, in a yellowish white which had grown sallow with time. On the third floor there was a sort of arched passage, connecting {{the two sides of the}} house, which Isabel and her sisters used in their childhood to call the tunnel and which, though it was short and well lighted, always seemed to the girl to be strange and lonely, especially on winter afternoons. She had been in the house, at different periods, as a child; in those days her grandmother lived there. Then there had been an absence of ten years, followed by a return to Albany before her father's death. Her grandmother, old Mrs. Archer, had exercised, chiefly within the limits of the family, a large hospitality in the early period, and the little girls often spent weeks under her roof--weeks of which Isabel had the happiest memory. The manner of life was different from that of her own home--larger, more plentiful, practically more festal; the discipline of the nursery was delightfully vague and the opportunity of listening to the conversation of one's elders (which with Isabel was a highly-valued pleasure) almost unbounded. There was a constant coming and going; her grandmother's sons and daughters and their children appeared to be in the enjoyment of standing invitations to arrive and remain, so that the house offered to a certain extent the appearance of a bustling provincial inn kept by a gentle old landlady who sighed a great deal and never presented a bill. Isabel of course knew nothing about bills; but even as a child she thought her grandmother's home romantic. There was a covered piazza behind it, furnished with a swing which was a source of tremulous interest; and beyond this was a long garden, sloping down to the stable and containing peach-trees of barely credible familiarity. Isabel had stayed with her grandmother at various seasons, but somehow all her visits had a flavour of peaches. On the other side, across the street, was an old house that was called the Dutch House--a peculiar structure dating from the earliest colonial time, composed of bricks that had been painted yellow, crowned with a gable that was pointed out to strangers, defended by a rickety wooden paling and standing sidewise to the street. It was occupied by a primary school for children of both sexes, kept or rather let go, by a demonstrative lady of whom Isabel's chief recollection was that her hair was fastened with strange bedroomy combs at the temples and that she was the widow of some one of consequence. The little girl had been offered the opportunity of laying a foundation of knowledge in this establishment; but having spent a single day in it, she had protested against its laws and had been allowed to stay at home, where, in the September days, when the windows of the Dutch House were open, she used to hear the hum of childish voices repeating the multiplication table--an incident in which the elation of liberty and the pain of exclusion were indistinguishably mingled. The foundation of her knowledge was really laid in the idleness of her grandmother's house, where, as most of the other inmates were not reading people, she had uncontrolled use of a library full of books with frontispieces, which she used to climb upon a chair to take down. When she had found one to her taste--she was guided in the selection chiefly by the frontispiece--she carried it into a mysterious apartment which lay beyond the library and which was called, traditionally, no one knew why, the office. Whose office it had been and at what period it had flourished, she never learned; it was enough for her that it contained an echo and a pleasant musty smell and that it was a chamber of disgrace for old pieces of furniture whose infirmities were not always apparent (so that the disgrace seemed unmerited and rendered them victims of injustice) and with which, in the manner of children, she had established relations almost human, certainly dramatic. There was an old haircloth sofa in especial, to which she had confided a hundred childish sorrows. The place owed much of its mysterious melancholy to the fact that it was properly entered from the second door of the house, the door that had been condemned, and that it was secured by bolts which a particularly slender little girl found it impossible to slide. She knew that this silent, motionless portal opened into the street; if the sidelights had not been filled with green paper she might have looked out upon the little brown stoop and the well-worn brick pavement. But she had no wish to look out, for this would have interfered with her theory that there was a strange, unseen place on the other side--a place which became to the child's imagination, according to its different moods, a region of delight or of terror.|$|E

40|$|The {{merits of}} the new textualism {{have been the subject}} of an {{enormous}} literature, a large majority of which rejects the method. This essay focuses on the Court 2 ̆ 7 s bankruptcy jurisprudence to make three claims. First, the case for the new textualism is a little stronger than is commonly thought, but ultimately fails to persuade, partly for reasons that are in the literature and partly for new reasons set out here. Regarding the second claim, the new textualism has two plausible justifications: to advance the rule of law virtues of predictability and certainty; and to create incentives for the legislature to draft more carefully and to deliberate more fully about its goals. A tension can exist between the first justification and the method itself. To see how, let a statute recite: 2 ̆ 2 Unfair contracts are not enforceable. 2 ̆ 2 A faithful interpretation of this text would confer discretion on the trial courts to police the process of contract formation and the substance of agreements. The exercise of a judicial discretion this broad, however, may conflict with the rule of law virtues. This essay 2 ̆ 7 s second claim holds that, at least in the bankruptcy field, the Court prefers the initial justification of the new textualism to the method itself. As a consequence, the Court will struggle, sometimes against text, to withdraw as much discretion as is possible from the bankruptcy and district courts. Put another way, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s goal is to find interpretations of the Bankruptcy Code that restrict the lower courts to the making of the most ministerial judgments that text and circumstances permit. This goal is advanced, for example, by interpretations that confine factual inquiries to questions of historical fact rather than to 2 ̆ 2 mixed 2 ̆ 2 questions of law and fact. Thus, the Court has held that bankruptcy judges should not inquire whether foreclosure proceedings actually obtained fair market value, but rather whether mortgagees complied with the statutory requirements these proceedings must satisfy, such as giving all parties <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> And the value of a secured claim, in the Chapter 13 context, is not to be found by valuing the liened collateral itself, but rather by asking how much remains unpaid under the mortgage. Valuation inquiries often are uncertain when done straight, and courts conducting them are widely believed to adopt valuation criteria that follow, at least partly, from the courts 2 ̆ 7 policy preferences. The second claim here is that Supreme Court interpretations of the Bankruptcy Code strive more to avoid such inquiries than to be faithful to the statutory text. This essay 2 ̆ 7 s third claim is that pursuit of the rule of law virtues through the vehicle of statutory interpretation will generally be pointless. A statute that confers substantial discretion on those who administer it permits these actors largely to avoid the effect of episodic discretion reducing readings by appellate courts. A statute that confers little discretion will itself confine its administrators if construed in traditional ways...|$|E

5000|$|The case {{involved}} a homeowner (Henrietta Eaton) {{who lost her}} house in Massachusetts via a foreclosure sale after defaulting on her mortgage. Eaton then filed a suit against Fannie Mae in Massachusetts Superior Court alleging that the record holder of the mortgage did not also hold the promissory note {{at the time of}} foreclosure. Due to this alleged lack of unity at the time <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> Eaton was alleging that property title was invalid. In its opinion, the S.J.C. asserted that although the statutes and case law from the nineteenth century implied that the mortgagee should also hold the note at time <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> the court would not apply the requirement of unity retroactively to June 22, 2012, but only prospectively from that date because the law was [...] "ambiguous" [...] and a retroactive application would have voided thousands of titles.
