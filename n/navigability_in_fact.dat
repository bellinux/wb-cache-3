Ever since Milgram’s small-world experiments [24], researchers have been making efforts to understand <b>navigability</b> and <b>in</b> particular efficient navigation in networks. Kleinberg [12, 25] and Watts [26] formalized the property that a navigable network requires short paths between all (or almost all) nodes. Formally, such a network has a low diameter bounded by a polynomial in log(n), where n {{is the number of}} nodes in the network, and a giant component containing almost all the nodes exists. In other words, because the majority of network nodes are connected, it is possible to reach all or almost all of the nodes, given global knowledge of the network. The low diameter and the existence of a giant component constitute necessary topological conditions for network <b>navigability.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we apply a set of standard network-theoretic measures to assess if a network satisfies them.|$|R

40|$|Many {{networks}} {{are used to}} transfer information or goods, in other words, they are navigated. The larger the network, {{the more difficult it}} is to navigate efficiently. Indeed, information routing in the Internet faces serious scalability problems due to its rapid growth, recently accelerated by the rise of the Internet of Things. Large networks like the Internet can be navigated efficiently if nodes, or agents, actively forward information based on hidden maps underlying these systems. However, in reality most agents will deny to forward messages, which has a cost, and navigation is impossible. Can we design appropriate incentives that lead to participation and global navigability? Here, we present an evolutionary game where agents share the value generated by successful delivery of information or goods. We show that global navigability can emerge, but its complete breakdown is possible as well. Furthermore, we show that the system tends to self-organize into local clusters of agents who participate in the navigation. This organizational principle can be exploited to favor the emergence of global <b>navigability</b> <b>in</b> the system. Comment: Supplementary Information and Videos: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{augmented}} graph model, as {{introduced by}} Kleinberg (STOC 2000), is an appealing model for analyzing <b>navigability</b> <b>in</b> social networks. Informally, {{this model is}} defined by a pair (H, ϕ), where H is a graph in which inter-node distances {{are supposed to be}} easy to compute or at least easy to estimate. This graph is ”augmented ” by links, called long-range links, which are selected according to the probability distribution ϕ. The augmented graph model enables the analysis of greedy routing in augmented graphs G ∈ (H, ϕ). In greedy routing, each intermediate node handling a message for a target t selects among all its neighbors in G the one that is the closest to t in H and forwards the message to it. This paper addresses the problem of checking whether a given graph G is an augmented graph. It answers part of the questions raised by Kleinberg in his Problem 9 (Int. Congress of Math. 2006). More precisely, given G ∈ (H, ϕ), we aim at extracting the base graph H an...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Kleinberg [17] {{proposed}} in 2000 the first random graph model achieving to reproduce small world navigability, i. e. {{the ability to}} greedily discover polylogarithmic routes between any pair of nodes in a graph, with only a partial knowledge of distances. Following this seminal work, a major challenge was to extend this model to larger classes of graphs than regular meshes, introducing the concept of augmented graphs <b>navigability.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we propose an original method of augmentation, based on metrics embeddings. Precisely, we prove that, for any ε> 0, any graph G such that its shortest paths metric admits an embedding of distorsion γ into R d can be augmented by one link per node such that greedy routing computes paths of expected length O (1 ε γd log 2 +ε n) between any pair of nodes with the only knowledge of G. Ourmethod isolates all the structural constraints {{in the existence of}} a good quality embedding and therefore enables to enlarge the characterization of augmentable graphs...|$|R

40|$|Graph {{augmentation}} {{theory is}} a general framework for analyzing <b>navigability</b> <b>in</b> social networks. It is known that, for large classes of graphs, there exist augmentations of these graphs such that greedy routing according to the shortest path metric performs in polylogarithmic expected number of steps. However, it is also known that there are classes of graphs for which no augmentations can enable greedy routing according to the shortest path metric to perform better than Ω(n 1 / √ log n) expected number of steps. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> the best known universal bound on the greedy diameter of arbitrary graph is essentially n 1 / 3. That is, for any graph, there is an augmentation such that greedy routing according to the shortest path metric performs in Õ(n 1 / 3) expected number of steps. Hence, greedy routing according to the shortest path metric has at least two drawbacks. First, it is in general space-consuming to encode locally the shortest path distances {{to all the other}} nodes, and, second, greedy routing according to the shortest path metric performs poorly in some graphs. We prove that, using semimetrics of small stretch results in a huge positive impact, in both encoding space and efficiency of greedy routing. More precisely, we show that, for any connected n-node graph G and any integer k ≥ 1, there exist an augmentation ϕ of G and a semimetric µ on G with stretch 2 k − 1 such that greedy routing according to µ performs in O(k 2 n 2 /k log 2 n) expected number of steps. As a corollary, we get that for any connected n-node graph G, there exist an augmentation ϕ of G and a semimetric µ on G with stretch O(log n) such that greedy routing according to µ performs in polylogarithmic expected number of steps. This latter semimetric can be encoded locally at every node using only a polylogarithmic number of bits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} dynamic process for network evolution, aiming at {{explaining}} {{the emergence of}} the small world phenomenon, i. e., the statistical observation that any pair of individuals are linked by a short chain of acquaintances computable by a simple decentralized routing algorithm, known as greedy routing. Our model is based on the combination of two dynamics: a random walk (spatial) process, and an harmonic forgetting (temporal) process. Both processes reflect natural behaviors of the individuals, viewed as nodes in the network of inter-individual acquaintances. We prove that, in k-dimensional lattices, the combination of these two processes generates long-range links mutually independently distributed as a k-harmonic distribution. We analyze the performances of greedy routing at the stationary regime of our process, and prove that the expected number of steps for routing from any source to any target in any multidimensional lattice is a polylogarithmic function of the distance between the two nodes in the lattice. Up to our knowledge, these results are the first formal proof that <b>navigability</b> <b>in</b> small worlds can emerge from a dynamic process for network evolution. Our dynamica process can find practical applications to the design of spatial gossip and resource location protocols...|$|R
