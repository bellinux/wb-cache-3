25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Corea took a {{profound}} stylistic turn from avant garde playing to a crossover jazz fusion style that incorporated Latin jazz elements with Return to Forever. Named after their eponymous 1972 album, the band relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and drew upon Latin American musical styles more than on rock music. On {{their first two}} records, Return to Forever featured Flora Purim's vocals, Corea's Fender Rhodes electric piano, Joe Farrell's flute and soprano saxophone, Airto Moreira on drums and percussion, with Stanley Clarke rounding up the group on acoustic bass. Drummer Lenny White and guitarist Bill Connors later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which expanded upon the earlier Latin jazz elements with a more hard-edged rock and funk-oriented sound inspired by Corea's admiration for Mahavishnu Orchestra, led by his Bitches Brew bandmate John McLaughlin. This incarnation of the group recorded the album Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, before Connors' departure and replacement by Al Di Meola, who was present on the subsequent releases Where Have I Known You Before, <b>No</b> <b>Mystery,</b> and the best selling Romantic Warrior.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode in 2010, for The A.V. Club, {{giving it a}} rating of an A. He praised {{the fact that there}} was <b>no</b> <b>mystery</b> to the episode, and that it was instead explained immediately that Sarek was the cause of the crewmembers' problems. He added that there was a [...] "beautiful simplicity to this concept, an elegance that makes the tragedy at the heart of the episode all the more powerful". Handlen said that the scene in which Picard deals with the emotions of Sarek after the mind meld was a [...] "remarkable work, a level of naked, raw intensity that we rarely get on , and in the hands of a lesser actor (basically anyone else in the ensemble), this could've been ridiculous".|$|E

500|$|Striptease was {{generally}} panned by film critics. It holds a 12% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 68 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times complimented {{some of the}} characters, but ultimately concluded the film failed because [...] "all of the characters are hilarious except for Demi Moore's." [...] He felt the drama surrounding the main character [...] "throws a wetblanket {{over the rest of}} the party." [...] Ebert also found the nudity not too sexy. Leonard Maltin was harsher, writing in his book that the film was too depressing, and [...] "Not funny enough, or dramatic enough, or sexy enough, or bad enough, to qualify as entertainment in any category." [...] Barbara Cramer concurred with Ebert that Moore's character was written too dramatically, compared to other characters. She said the film was predictable and would appeal mostly to [...] "post-pubescent schoolboys or closet voyeurs." [...] However, Cramer also cited Reynolds' [...] "his best role in years," [...] and that Rhames was [...] "worth the price of admission." [...] Brian D. Johnson of Maclean's, who thought Moore's acting was terrible, predicted that despite Moore's financial success, her career depended on the success of this film and the film was [...] "tacky, pretentious-and boring." [...] This critic described Striptease as displaying Moore's vanity. Dave Ansen of Newsweek, sharing Ebert's view on Moore's character, also claimed Striptease failed as a drama because it had <b>no</b> <b>mystery,</b> revealing the identity of its villains early. Moreover, the [...] "damsel-in-distress angle generates zero tension." [...] Daniel P. Franklin, ...|$|E

During Stanford's meteoric 1940 season, Warner said, [...] "Shaughnessy has taken that T formation we used when I played at Cornell in [...] and made it work as it has never worked before. This is because he has added his own ideas. There is <b>no</b> <b>mystery</b> about Shaughnessy's success at Stanford as I see it.

2500|$|Although Helms, at that time, {{might have}} {{appeared}} as an emblematic upholder of the Agency's work, for years, the [...] "memory of his no-contest plea still stung. It was a stain {{in spite of}} the widespread support he had received." [...] By 1983, however, [...] "the end of the anti-CIA decade" [...] had arrived. As Helms took the podium to speak, he was given a [...] "returning war hero's welcome" [...] by top USG officials and hundreds of guests at the Grand Ballroom of the Washington Hilton. [...] "I am touched and honored. My reasons can be <b>no</b> <b>mystery</b> to any of you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Construction {{began in}} December from the O tracks at Manassas Junction. On December 14, 1861, the {{newspapers}} {{reported that the}} new line was fully surveyed, was being leveled and that the line would run [...] to Bull Run and then [...] beyond that {{to the rear of}} the army. [...] The rails, by order of Captain Thomas R. Sharp, were brought in from warehouses where they were being held in storage in Winchester, Virginia by wagon down to Strasburg, Virginia, and then by rail car to the Manassas Junction. [...] "It is <b>no</b> <b>mystery</b> that the iron for the track came from the South's one unfailing source of supply in 1861, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad." [...] A deserter from the 6th Louisiana Infantry, who left Centreville on January 7, 1862 reported that 300 men were working on the railroad project. [...] The Pinkerton National Detective Agency confirmed on January 27, 1862, based on the report of a deserter that the railroad construction was in progress.|$|E
