40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} study of mechanical behavior of an edge-notched steel plate repaired by polymer composite and smart patches. The polymer composite patches are made of Kevlar/epoxy and glass/epoxy {{or a combination of}} both. The plate is single edge-notched with a constant length and the repair is done {{on both sides of the}} <b>notched</b> <b>plate.</b> Four types of patches are considered according to their lay-ups. Tensile, bending, and impact tests are conducted on the specimens according to ASTM standards. The results obtained are compared with the results for un-notched and un-repaired notched specimens. Patching has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the <b>notched</b> <b>plate.</b> The best patches in each loading case are reinforced with nickeltitanium shape memory wires and the repaired specimens with these smart patches are again tested in tension, bending, and impact loadings. Smart patches had a more significant effect on the above behavior as compared to composite patches.

40|$|International audienceThe present work {{is devoted}} to the {{numerical}} simulation of crack propagation in engineering materials whose failure results from void initiation, growth and coalescence. The behaviour of the plate material is described via a Gurson type model accounting for the combined effects of strain hardening, thermal softening, viscoplasticity and void growth induced damage. The eXtended Finite Element Method has been retained to describe the kinematic consequences of the crack propagation across the mesh. The crack is assumed to propagate as soon as the stored energy around the crack tip reaches a critical value. The related crack length is estimated using an exhaustion method. The constitutive model and the extended finite elements were both implemented in the engineering FE computation code Abaqus as user subroutines. The numerical simulation of a <b>notched</b> <b>plate</b> and an asymmetrically <b>notched</b> <b>plate</b> under tension loading has been conducted. While making some simplifications, the present work reproduces numerically the 2 D propagation of a crack resulting from void growth induced damage...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeveral {{methods for}} fatigue life {{prediction}} of structural components {{have been proposed}} in literature. The fatigue life prediction based on crack growth analysis has been proposed to assess the residual fatigue life of components, which requires the definition of an initial flaw. Alternatively, Fracture Mechanics crack growth-based fatigue predictions {{may be used to}} simulate the whole fatigue life of structural components assuming that there are always initial defects on materials, acting as equivalent initial cracks [1, 2]. This latter approach is applied to a <b>notched</b> <b>plate</b> made of P 355 NL 1 steel [3]. Fatigue crack growth data of the material is evaluated using CT specimens, covering several stress R-ratios. Also, S-N fatigue data is available for the double <b>notched</b> <b>plate,</b> for a stress R-ratio equal to 0 [3]. An estimate of the equivalent initial flaw size is proposed, using a back-extrapolation calculation [1, 2]. The crack propagation model takes into account the elastic–plastic deformations in the crack-tip area within the calculation, based on the cyclic J-integral method. The performances of predictions are analyzed and deviations discussed...|$|E
40|$|The fatigue {{lives of}} {{variously}} <b>notched</b> <b>plates</b> have been determined theoretically and experimentally. Theoretical predictions of fatigue lives involved {{the determination of}} stress-intensity factors from fhiteelement analyses. By invoking a crack propagation law, fatigue-life predictions were made for four specimens. Fatigue experiments were conducted on four <b>notched</b> <b>plates</b> subjected to end load plus bending. Comparison with theoretical results shows that the experimental lives were greater by factors of 1. 30 to 1. 54. These results are most satisfactory since (1) a safe prediction of fatigue life has been made for a complex profib subjected to non-simple loading conditions, and (2) a theoretical elastic analysis has sufficed for a situation involving plastic strains. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{validity}} {{of the idea of}} severity near the notch root of <b>notched</b> FRP <b>plates</b> is investigated experimentally. The investigation was accomplished by obtaining experimental data on the static and cyclic loading tests for <b>notched</b> <b>plates</b> of a glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene (GF/PP). To evaluate the damage near the notch root, we measured the luminance distributions by means of a luminance-measuring technique using a CCD camera. The experimental results for the static loading tests show that the configuration and the area of damaged zone near the notch root were determined by both the maximum elastic stress at the notch root, max and notch-root radius. The maximum elastic stress at fracture, max,c is governed by the notch-root radius and it is independent of notch depth. The number of loading cycles to fatigue damage initiation is determined by both the max and. These experimental results confirm the {{validity of}} the failure criterion in static load and the fatigue failure criterion based on the idea of severity near the notch root. 1...|$|R

40|$|Probabilistic fatigue {{models are}} {{required}} to account conveniently for the several sources of uncertainty arising in the prediction procedures, such as the scatter in material behavior. In this paper, a recently proposed stress-based probabilistic model is assessed using fatigue data available for the P 355 NL 1 steel (a pressure vessel steel). The referred probabilistic model is a log-Gumbel regression model, able to predict the probabilistic Wöhler field (P-S-N field), {{taking into account the}} mean stress (or stress R-ratio) effects. The parameters of the probabilistic model are identified using stress-life data derived for the P 355 NL 1 steel, from smooth specimens, for three distinct stress R-ratios, namely R- 1, R- 0. 5, and R 0. The model requires a minimum of two test series with distinct stress R-ratios. Since data from three test series is available, extrapolations are performed to test the adequacy of the model to make extrapolations for stress R-ratios other than those used in the model parameters assessment. Finally, the probabilistic model is used to model the fatigue behavior of a <b>notched</b> <b>plate</b> made of P 355 NL 1 steel. In particular, the P-S-N field of the plate is modeled and compared with available experimental data. Cyclic elastoplastic analysis of the plate is performed since plasticity at the notch root is developed. The probabilistic model correlated appropriately the stress-life data available for the P 355 NL 1 steel and was able to perform extrapolations for stress ratios other than those used in the model identification. The P-S-N field identified using data from smooth specimens led to consistent predictions of the P-S-N field for a <b>notched</b> <b>plate,</b> demonstrating the adequacy of the probabilistic model also to predict the probabilistic Wöhler field for notched components...|$|E

For the demonstration of effectiveness of this method, surface strains of unnotched and semicircular <b>notched</b> <b>plate</b> specimens made of aluminum alloy were measured under uniaxial tension.

40|$|The stress {{concentrations}} {{produced by}} tensile loading of elastic solids with periodic notches are addressed. The criterion suggested by Neuber, which likens the periodic notch {{to a single}} notch of similar shape but smaller depth, is evaluated. According to Neuber, the depth reduction factor only depends on the ratio between the depth and pitch of the periodic notch, regardless of its particular shape. This work benchmarks the criterion against many axially loaded flat plates and round bars with periodic V-notches, which are analysed {{by means of the}} boundary element method. The investigation highlights a strong disparity between Neuber’s predictions and numerical findings. However, upon slight adjustment of the depth reduction factor with respect to Neuber’s proposal, a satisfactory agreement is achieved. The good correlation holds true both for shallow <b>notches</b> (<b>notched</b> semi-infinite <b>plate)</b> and for deep <b>notches</b> (<b>notched</b> <b>plates</b> or bars of finite width), which were not covered in Neuber’s work. Excellent correspondence is also found for the stress concentration around an infinite row of equispaced circular holes loaded longitudinally, a solution taken from the literature as a testcase.
