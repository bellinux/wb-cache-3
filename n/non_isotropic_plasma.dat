In {{the context of}} liner perturbations, {{it is found that}} there appear two wave modes corresponding to a slow phase velocity and a fast phase velocity as is resembled to those in <b>isotropic</b> <b>plasmas.</b> For the fast phase velocity mode, pressure perturbations and field perturbations exhibited paramagnetic relations, similarly to <b>isotropic</b> <b>plasmas.</b> For the slow phase velocity mode, paramagnetic properties appear, unlike the isotropic case, at higher plasma beta part of lower pressure anisotropy (perpendicular/parallel) region...|$|R
40|$|URL] audienceFollowing Yoffe (1982) stress- and strain-fields due to glass {{indentation}} {{are related}} to « unorthodox » plasticity, {{that is to say}} non isovolumic irreversible strain. For such a densification process, her basic definition of an equivalent elastic truncated spherical inclusion uses <b>non</b> <b>isotropic</b> uniform pressures similar to the elastic-pseudoplastic field. Such a field is composed of a vertical pressure spreaded on a circular area and of a radial expansion pressure; this field becomes an approximation of the elastic-densificating field expressed as the superposition of the Boussinesq (1885) field and a blister field. This equivalence between <b>non</b> <b>isotropic</b> but uniform elastic pressure field and elastic-densificating field is approximated via a truncated Fourier's serie; our semi-analytical results try to be written explicitly with Poisson's coefficient and encourage to future experimental and theoretical developments...|$|R
40|$|The electron-transparent and electron-reflecting {{models of}} antennas {{in a warm}} <b>isotropic</b> <b>plasma</b> are reexamined. It is shown that a purely {{electrical}} treatment of both the models without an explicit use of the boundary condition on electron velocity yields the same results as those previously obtained through an electromechanical treatment. The essential {{difference between the two}} models is that for the electron-reflecting model, fields are nonzero only in the exterior region, while for the electron-transparent model, they are nonzero both in the exterior and interior regions of the antenna. This distinction helps in clarifying some misconceptions about these models of antennas in warm <b>isotropic</b> <b>plasma...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary. In {{the paper}} an {{original}} integration scheme for <b>non</b> <b>isotropic</b> finite deformation plasticity is reported and {{compared with the}} analogous model for isotropic materials. It is formulated in a general tensorial form, and is thermodynamically consistent. Numerical applications show that the new scheme can be effectively applied to structural problems...|$|R
5000|$|When a texture {{is viewed}} at a steep angle, the {{filtering}} {{should not be}} uniform in each direction (it should be anisotropic rather than isotropic), and a compromise resolution is required. If a higher resolution is used, the cache coherence goes down, and the aliasing is increased in one direction, but the image tends to be clearer. If a lower resolution is used, the cache coherence is improved, but the image is overly blurry. This would be a tradeoff of MIP level of detail (LOD) for aliasing vs blurriness. However anisotropic filtering attempts to resolve this trade-off by sampling a <b>non</b> <b>isotropic</b> texture footprint for each pixel rather than merely adjusting the MIP LOD. This <b>non</b> <b>isotropic</b> texture sampling requires either a more sophisticated storage scheme or a summation of more texture fetches at higher frequencies.|$|R

40|$|Context: The mean {{free path}} and {{anisotropy}} of galactic cosmic rays (CR) is calculated in weak plasma wave turbulence that is isotropically distributed {{with respect to the}} ordered uniform magnetic field. Aims: The modifications on the value of the Hillas energy, above which CR are not confined to the Galaxy, are calculated. The original determination of the Hillas limit has been based on the case of slab turbulence where only parallel propagating plasma waves are allowed. Methods: We use quasilinear Fokker-Planck coefficients to calculate the {{mean free path}} and the anisotropy in <b>isotropic</b> <b>plasma</b> wave turbulence. Results: In <b>isotropic</b> <b>plasma</b> wave turbulence the Hillas limit is enhanced by about four orders of magnitude to E c = 2. 03 2 ̆ 02210 4 An_e 1 / 2 (L max / 1 pc) resulting from the dominating influence of transit-time damping interactions that obliquely propagating magnetosonic waves undergo with cosmic rays...|$|R

It is known that the electronic band structure of bulk ZnO is characterized by a <b>non</b> <b>isotropic</b> and <b>non</b> parabolic energy spectrum [34]. However, for the current problem of collective dynamics of N delocalized electrons, we will neglect these small energy spectrum effects and consider an isotropic parabolic energy dispersion with effective mass m_e^*= 0.3 m_e [34]. For the same reason, we consider the ZnO NCs as spherical systems.|$|R

3000|$|As a {{consistency}} check, when α goes to zero, [...] F_z becomes {{equal to}} [...] B_z and [...] p_T = p_ = p, {{and the last}} term on the right in (8) becomes zero.

40|$|The Problem: This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} 3 D rigid motion estimation from stereo. The appealing feature {{of this approach is}} that it directly uses disparity images and do not require explicit 3 -D (Euclidean) reconstructions. Motivation: We assume that the stereo rig has parallel cameras and show, in that case, the geometric and topological properties of the disparity images. Then weintroduce a rigid transformation (called d-motion) thatmapstwo disparity images of a rigidly moving object. We show how it is related to the Euclidean rigid motion and a motion estimation algorithm is derived. Previous Work: Many approaches for ego-motion andmotionestimation with a stereo rig have a common structure. First, image points are matched in the image pair. A disparity image is obtained, and a scene reconstruction is performed in the Euclidean space. Then the rigid motion is estimated based on 3 -D point correspondences. Unfortunately using the 3 -D Euclidean space to estimate rigid motions fails to give optimal solutions because reconstructions performed in 3 -D Euclidean space have non homogeneous and <b>non</b> <b>isotropic</b> noise (as wrongly approximated in many standard SVD- or quaternion-based approaches). One should instead use methods that deal with non homogeneous and <b>non</b> <b>isotropic</b> noise [4, 3] or methods that look for an optimum solution for both structure and motion, like bundle-adjustment [1]...|$|R
