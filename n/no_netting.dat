60|$|As he talked, I {{imagined}} the life they had led. At first the trail was good, {{and they were}} able to make twenty miles each day. The weather was dry and warm, and sleeping was not impossible. They camped close beside the trail when they grew tired--I had seen and recognized their camping-places all along. But the rains came on, and they were forced to walk all day through the wet shrubs with the water dripping from their ragged garments. They camped at night beneath the firs (for the ground is always dry under a fir), where a fire is easily built. There they hung over the flame, drying their clothing and their rapidly weakening shoes. The mosquitoes swarmed upon them bloodily in the shelter and warmth of the trees, for they had <b>no</b> <b>netting</b> or tent. Their meals were composed of tea, a few hastily stewed beans, and a poor quality of sticky camp bread. Their sleep was broken and fitful. They were either too hot or too cold, and the mosquitoes gave way only when the frost made slumber difficult. In the morning they awoke to the necessity of putting on their wet shoes, and taking the muddy trail, to travel as long as they could stagger forward.|$|E

40|$|Offsetting is {{a policy}} {{instrument}} intended to provide flexibility for development. We developed a simple calculator to predict when <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss is feasible using biodiversity offsetting. Assuming offset ratios ≤ 10 : 1 are indicative of operational feasibility and employing a discount rate of 3 %, we predicted that <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss is feasible where biodiversity can be restored within 55 years, which restricts the impacts on biodiversity that can be offset using restoration. Alternatively, <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss is feasible by avoiding loss to biodiversity that is declining under the counterfactual {{at an annual rate}} ≥ 6 %. However, this is considerably higher than typical background rates of biodiversity loss so restricts where avoided-loss offsets are feasible. <b>No</b> <b>net</b> loss is theoretically feasible in the broadest range of circumstances if biodiversity gains are provided in advance of development. However, these gains are procured by restoration or avoided loss, so constraints presented by these approaches also apply. We concluded that <b>no</b> <b>net</b> loss is feasible in a limited range of development scenarios unless offset ratios greater than 10 : 1 are more widely tolerated...|$|R

Glucosinolates (GSLs) are thioglucosides produced by turnip (Brassica rapa subsp. rapa) and other cruciferous vegetables with important properties for plant defense and human health, particularly cancer prevention. We compared yield and GSL {{concentrations in the}} roots and shoots of turnip cultivars grown using plastic colored mulch and photoselective netting treatments in both a May and August planting. Turnip yield and GSL concentrations were dependent on tissue type, genotype and environmental factors. ‘Just Right’ roots and shoots consistently had the highest yield and gluconapin concentration of the cultivars examined in field experiments. In most instances, ‘Scarlet Queen’ roots had the highest total GSL concentrations while ‘Just Right’ roots had the least. Although colored plastic mulches significantly influenced both total and individual GSL concentrations, mulch-dependent increases in GSL concentrations were not consistent across tissue types, cultivars, planting dates and years of the study. Photoselective nettings did not consistently affect shoot or root yield or GSL concentration in root tissues. Netting was only a significant factor for glucobrassicanapin (GBN) concentration in shoots with the <b>no</b> <b>netting</b> treatment resulting in the highest GBN concentration. Planting date and year interactions were significant for total and individual GSL concentrations and proportions in both plastic mulch and photoselective netting experiments. These interactions are partially explained by differences in air temperatures and solar radiation prior to harvest. To assess the specific role of temperature on GSL concentration and biosynthetic regulation in roots and shoots, turnips were grown under three different temperature regimes in a controlled environment. Gene expression analyses indicate that some BrMYB transcription factor transcript levels are associated with temperature-dependent changes in GSL concentration, however this association varies between cultivar and tissue type. When compared to low temperature treatments, high temperature treatments increased total, aliphatic and indolic GSLs in a tissue and genotype specific manner. Gluconasturtiin (GNS), an aromatic GSL, concentration was inversely correlated with temperature with high temperature treatments resulting in 20 % and 48 % less GNS than low temperature treatments in JR and SQ roots, respectively. The indolic GSL, 1 -methoxyglucobrassicin (1 MGB) was the root GSL most elevated by increased temperature resulting in a nine-fold increase on average in both cultivars between the low and high temperature treatments. These results show promise {{for the use of}} temperature to enhance the health promoting properties of turnip as 1 MGB has potent chemopreventive effects...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} effects of net {{neutrality}} on media diversity. We show that in the net neutrality regime, media firms al- ways provide media diversity, whereas in the <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality regime, the equilibrium of the model depends on the relation between net- work capacity and network traffic. If the network capacity is large relatively to network traffic, the equilibrium of the <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality regime {{is similar to the}} one under the net neutrality regime. However, if network capacity is small relative to network traffic, under the <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality regime media firms do not provide media diversity. The reason is that when network capacity is small relative to network traf- fic, the <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality regime hinders competition. In other words, with <b>no</b> <b>net</b> neutrality, the media firm with priority sees its hinter- land more protected from its rival than under net neutrality, and the contrary for the firm with no priority. As a result, while the media firm with priority has less need to provide media diversity to attract demand and as such advertising revenues, the media firm with no pri- ority finds it more difficult to use media diversity to attract demand and advertising revenues...|$|R
