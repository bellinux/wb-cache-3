40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Angus Wilson's novels {{with particular}} attention to <b>No</b> Laughing <b>Matter,</b> 1967. The introductory overview of Wilson's first five novels and the examination of <b>No</b> Laughing <b>Matter</b> show that all Wilson's novels are concerned with his protagonists' capacity for self-deception and the ways deception limits freedom of choice.
