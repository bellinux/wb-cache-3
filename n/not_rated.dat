The mission module {{was determined to be}} only useful as an extra room, and therefore deemed unnecessary. They used Faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in October 1961. On November 28, 1961, it was announced that North American Aviation had won the contract, although its bid was <b>not</b> <b>rated</b> as good as Martin's. Webb, Dryden and Robert Seamans chose it in preference due to North American's longer association with NACA.|$|E

By comparison, Jack Thompson of Washington State rated an eight, the highest grade among eligible quarterbacks.|$|E

In its final report, the Commission refrained from ranking each of the cities or identifying a favorite. Instead, they identified three cities as excellent candidates; Beijing, Paris, and Toronto. In effect, the commission recommended each of these cities equally. In rejecting Istanbul, they expressed concerns {{about the ability of}} the city to coordinate financing and construction of infrastructure. In particular, they were concerned that the plans for transportation infrastructure improvements would be difficult to achieve. Osaka was also <b>not</b> <b>rated</b> excellent due to concerns about financing and traffic congestion.|$|E
25|$|Snary's batting was <b>not</b> <b>rated</b> at Leicestershire {{until late}} in his career, and {{he spent most of}} his {{first-class}} matches batting at No 9 or No 10: a career average of 15 and an extremely high proportion of not-out innings – 114 out of 249 – indicate that he was probably under-rated as a batsman, but he only passed 50 once. That was in 1932 in the game against the Indian touring team when, having top-scored with 25 in Leicestershire's first innings batting at No 8, he was sent in to open the innings when the county followed on and carried his bat throughout an innings of 291, scoring 124 not out himself.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{trucks and}} tanker trucks can cause {{expensive}} road damage such as cracked pavement and potholes on roads <b>not</b> <b>rated</b> for heavy traffic. Engineers in the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation have documented {{damage caused by}} the heavy trucks and tankers. Damage includes crushing of drain pipes, potholes, rutting, and pavement fatigue failure. The cost of these repairs are often {{much higher than the}} Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is allowed to charge for road use. In addition to causing road damage, when heavy trucks and tankers drive over farmland, they compact the subsoil, which increases runoff and decreases crop productivity for years. Ecologists also have concerns about the ecological impact on forests when trees are cut down to make way for access roads. Ornithologists have documented declining populations of woodland birds.|$|E

25|$|Welman {{was born}} 19 February 1849 at Norton Manor in Norton Fitzwarren, just outside Taunton, {{the son of}} Charles Noel Welman, a Justice of the peace for Somerset. He was educated at Oxford University, but was <b>not</b> <b>rated</b> as good enough to feature in the university's cricket side. His first noted cricket {{appearance}} was for 'Surrey Club' against Uppingham School, a two-day match played at The Oval in London. During the 1870s, he appeared for both the Gentlemen of Devon, and the Gentlemen of Somerset a few times each year. When the two sides faced he each other, he appeared for the Somerset side. His first-class debut came in 1874, when he appeared for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Cambridge University. In a nine wicket loss for the MCC, he was dismissed for a duck in the first innings, and three runs in the second. He did not play another first-class match for almost five years, when he faced Oxford University for the MCC, during which he once again was dismissed without scoring in the first innings.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that he was a popular success as a composer, Bernstein himself is {{reported}} to have been disillusioned that some of his more serious works were <b>not</b> <b>rated</b> more highly by critics, and that he himself had not been able to devote more time to composing because of his conducting and other activities. Professional criticism of Bernstein's music often involves discussing the degree to which he created something new as art versus simply skillfully borrowing and fusing together elements from others. In the late 1960s, Bernstein himself reflected that his eclecticism was in part due to his lack of lengthy periods devoted to composition, and that he was still seeking to enrich his own personal musical language in the manner of the great composers of the past, all of whom had borrowed elements from others. Perhaps the harshest criticism he received from some critics in his lifetime though was directed at works like his Kaddish Symphony, his MASS and the opera A Quiet Place, where they found the underlying message of the piece or the text as either mildly embarrassing, clichéd or offensive. Despite this, all these pieces have been performed, discussed and reconsidered since his death.|$|E

500|$|ESRB {{ratings are}} {{primarily}} identified through icons, which are {{displayed on the}} packaging and promotional materials for a game. Each icon contains a stylized alphabetical letter representing the rating. [...] In addition to the main age-based, ratings, ESRB ratings also incorporate {{one or more of}} 30 [...] "content descriptors" [...] which provide detailed information about the specific types and levels of objectionable content contained in a game, including categories covering different levels of violence, language, sexual content, nudity, use of alcoholic beverages or other drugs, crude and mature humor, or gambling. The full label, containing both the descriptors and rating, are typically displayed {{on the back of a}} game's packaging. Games which incorporate online features must display the additional notice [...] "Online Interactions <b>Not</b> <b>Rated</b> by the ESRB" [...] (previously [...] "Game Experience May Change During Online Play"), which disclaims that the rating only applies to the content contained within the game itself, and does not cover any user-generated content available within.|$|E

500|$|The ESRB enforces {{guidelines}} {{that have been}} adopted by the video game industry {{in order to ensure}} responsible advertising and marketing practices. These include ensuring that game packaging, advertisements, and trailers properly display rating information, restricting where advertising materials for games rated [...] "Teen" [...] or higher can appear, forbidding publishers from [...] "glamoriz or exploiting" [...] a game's rating in advertising, and requiring online marketing of games rated [...] "Mature" [...] or higher to be restricted to users who are appropriately aged. This allows the ESRB to restrict video game advertising [...] "to consumers for whom the product is <b>not</b> <b>rated</b> as appropriate." [...] The board also forbids ratings from other organizations from being shown alongside ESRB ratings on publishers' websites or social media outlets. A group of online gaming publications known as the ESRB Website Council operates under a similar code of conduct, which requires them to display ESRB ratings information for games that they cover, and implement systems to restrict access to audiovisual content depicting M or AO-rated games to users who are appropriately aged.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the event}} have been mainly positive. Writing for Online Onslaught, {{columnist}} Adam Gutschmidt stated that the event is the best King of the Ring show to watch.

He thought that the eight-man match served no real purpose, the match between Luger and Tatanka was poorly planned and executed, and that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was the worst on the card. Also writing for Online Onslaught, Rick Scaia also enjoyed Bret Hart's matches. He thought that the match between Tatanka and Luger was a [...] "good booking decision" [...] and that the wrestlers performed well in the match.
