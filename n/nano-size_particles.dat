One {{of the most}} used composite materials is the epoxy resins (EP), which is a thermoset polymer matrix. After cure, this material displays some excellent mechanical, thermal, electrical and chemical properties. For these reasons, it has been widely used {{for a wide range}} of automotive and aerospace applications, as well as for shipbuilding or electronic devices. However, EP has poor resistance to crack propagation and is brittle. So, in recent years, a considerable amount of research has been carried out to improve the performance of the toughness of EP. The most common studied technique consist to reinforce the EP matrix with rigid nano-particle fillers, such as alumina, silica, mica, talc, organoclays, nanoclays, carbon nanotubes, TiO 2, among others.
