His friend, Mr. Darcy, is reputed to be twice as wealthy; however, he is haughty and aloof. He declines to dance with Elizabeth, suggesting that she is <b>not</b> <b>pretty</b> enough to tempt him. She finds this amusing and jokes about the statement with her friends. Mr. Bingley's sister, Caroline, later invites Jane to visit.|$|E

Sébastien Bourdais of Toro Rosso said that [...] "the penalty is really rough {{but in the}} end it's up to you to give the position back or <b>not.</b> <b>Pretty</b> straightforward". The view was reiterated by his fellow drivers Nico Rosberg and Jarno Trulli. Trulli {{believed that}} [...] "Hamilton got an advantage by cutting the chicane", saying, [...] "Had he stayed on the road, he wouldn't have had the speed to overtake the Ferrari. In the same way at Monza someone could cut the first chicane, catch a rival's draft, and overtake him under braking at Roggia".|$|E
500|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} of Ernest's childhood. When he was fourteen months old, a servant commented that Ernest [...] "runs {{around like a}} weasel. He is teething and as cross as a little badger from impatience and liveliness. He is <b>not</b> <b>pretty</b> now, except his beautiful black eyes". In May 1820, his mother described Ernest as [...] "very big for his age, as well as intelligent. His big black eyes are full of spirit and vivacity". Biographer Richard Hough writes that [...] "even from their infancy, it was plainly evident that the elder son took after his father, in character and appearance, while Albert strongly resembled his mother in most respects". Ernest and his brother often lived with their grandmother the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld until her death in 1831.|$|E
500|$|Q, {{in their}} review of Doolittle, {{described}} [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven": [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>pretty,</b> but its carefully structured noise and straight forward rhythmic insistence makes perfect sense: {{a gut feeling}} that is doubled when it gets within sniffing distance of a tune, as on 'Monkey Gone to Heaven' or 'Debaser'." [...] Rolling Stones David Fricke, reviewing Doolittle, said [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] was [...] "a corrosive, compelling meditation on God and garbage." [...] The critical success of [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] was also reflected commercially; the song reached number five on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, marking the Pixies' debut in the American charts. However, the song did not perform {{as well in the}} British charts, reaching a peak position of number 60 and falling off the charts after three weeks.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} the eighth most-watched {{program of the}} week along with NBC's Sunday Night Football, with 11.4 million viewers, it {{received}} a 17 share in the ratings. Overall, the episode was well received by critics. Nina Hämmerling Smith of TV Guide quoted: [...] "Perhaps {{the best thing about}} the episode was the amount of screen time given to old favorites like Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). The show's most convincing writing has always been in the scenes when those two spar with House, and I was thrilled to see more of that". Most critics were surprised and interested by the performance of Chris Taub in this episode. Richard Keller of TV Squad, wrote that he was almost certain of the fact that Taub was going to be fired and he was glad that he wasn't. He also quoted, [...] "For some reason I like Taub. Maybe because he's <b>not</b> <b>pretty</b> like the rest of them. He's just an everyday schlub who's a pretty decent doctor".|$|E
500|$|As an adolescent, Olga {{received}} frequent reminders {{from her}} mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses. On January 11, 1909, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year-old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse [...] "nervous" [...] when she was tired and not feeling well. Olga responded on January 12, 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes {{had good reason to}} be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy. On January 24, 1909, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname [...] "Unmounted Cossack", again: [...] "You are growing very big — don't be so wild and kick about and show your legs, it is <b>not</b> <b>pretty.</b> I never did so when your age or when I was smaller and younger even." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club was positive towards the episode {{and gave it}} an A. He applauded {{the fact that it}} [...] "lets Scully be flawed" [...] and allowed her to be [...] "far more human" [...] than usual on the show. Handlen concluded that the episode was a success because it illustrated [...] "the way our need to connect with others makes us vulnerable". He was, however, critical of Mulder's actions in the episode, calling him a [...] "spoiled ass" [...] and noted that there was a [...] "little boy ignored feel to his dialogue at the end". John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 7 out of 10 and called it [...] "one of the best character studies of the entire series". He concluded that [...] "Much of Scully’s underlying psychology is explored in this episode, and in keeping with what has been revealed about Mulder, it’s <b>not</b> <b>pretty.</b> The final act doesn’t quite match the intensity of the third, but it’s rather clear what the writers were trying to convey." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com wrote positively of the episode and noted that [...] "t is fortunate, I think, that the Super Bowl forced the change in sequence." [...] She argued that, had “Leonard Betts” not aired before [...] "Never Again", the audience would have been forced to [...] "read her actions as reactions to Mulder and Mulder alone" [...] rather than against the fact that she has cancer.|$|E

2500|$|To {{argue that}} the earth was being chosen for regular visitations, Sagan said, {{one would have to}} assume that the planet is somehow unique.

And if we're <b>not</b> <b>pretty</b> common then there aren't going to be many civilizations advanced enough to send visitors." ...|$|E

He spoke of watching the {{news coverage of the}} deadly confrontation between Israeli commandos and multinational aid group members as its flotilla approached Israel's sea blockade of Gaza. He said, [...] "What I saw was <b>not</b> <b>pretty,</b> it was ugly." [...] He has since continued his criticism, saying later that the organizers' failure to seek accord with Israel before attempting to deliver aid was [...] "a sign of defying authority, and will not lead to fruitful matters." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Not</b> a <b>Pretty</b> Girl is {{the sixth}} studio album {{released}} by singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco {{on her own}} record label, Righteous Babe Records. It was released July 18, 1995. The album extended the folk singer's early formula of acoustic guitar and drums. On subsequent records, DiFranco would add electric guitar, horns, band members and guest musicians, but on <b>Not</b> a <b>Pretty</b> Girl she was accompanied by Andy Stochansky's percussion alone.|$|R

2500|$|The Russians were <b>not</b> <b>pretty</b> close. I think Russia had {{no chance}} to be ahead of the Americans under Sergei Korolev and his successor, Vasili Mishin. Korolev was not a scientist, not a designer: he was a {{brilliant}} manager. Korolev's problem was his mentality. His intent was to somehow use the launcher he had [...] It was designed in 1958 for a different purpose and with a limited payload of about 70 tons. His philosophy was, let’s not work by stages , but let’s assemble everything and then try it. And at last it will work. There were several attempts and failures with Lunnik [...] Sending man to the moon is too complicated, too complex for such an approach. I think it was doomed from the very beginning.|$|E
2500|$|After {{more than}} 20film roles, {{the role of}} the vicious and slatternly Mildred Rogers in the RKO Radio {{production}} of Of Human Bondage (1934), a film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel, earned Davis her first major critical acclaim. Many actresses feared playing unsympathetic characters, and several had refused the role, but Davis viewed it as an opportunity to show the range of her acting skills. Her co-star, Leslie Howard, was initially dismissive of her, but as filming progressed, his attitude changed and he subsequently spoke highly of her abilities. The director, John Cromwell, allowed her relative freedom, and commented, [...] "I let Bette have her head. I trusted her instincts." [...] She insisted that she be portrayed realistically in her death scene, and said, [...] "the last stages of consumption, poverty, and neglect are <b>not</b> <b>pretty</b> and I intended to be convincing-looking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1855, Stuart met Flora Cooke, the {{daughter}} of the commander of the 2nd U.S. Dragoon Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Philip St. George Cooke. Burke Davis described Flora as [...] "an accomplished horsewoman, and though <b>not</b> <b>pretty,</b> an effective charmer," [...] to whom [...] "Stuart succumbed with hardly a struggle." [...] They became engaged in September, less than two months after meeting. Stuart humorously wrote of his rapid courtship in Latin, [...] "Veni, Vidi, Victus sum" [...] (I came, I saw, I was conquered). Although a gala wedding was planned for Fort Riley, Kansas, the death of Stuart's father on September 20 caused a change of plans and the marriage on November 14 was small and limited to family witnesses. [...] The couple owned two slaves until 1859, one inherited from his father's estate, the other purchased.|$|E
