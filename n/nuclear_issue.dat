5|$|Throughout this, Idelba {{has been}} {{secretly}} working on atomic physics {{and she and}} her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that {{it would be possible to}} make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the <b>nuclear</b> <b>issue.</b> The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).|$|E
25|$|In November 1958, Tage Erlander {{convened a}} party Atomic Weapons Committee (AWC) where advocates {{from both sides}} and {{military}} experts got together. The Prime Minister was initially inclined to take the pro-nuclear side, in the meantime {{he did not want}} to risk dividing the party over the <b>nuclear</b> <b>issue.</b> The Social Democrats, who kept losing their electorate, had to build a coalition with the adamantly anti-nuclear Communists.

25|$|During Aspin's {{term the}} U.S. was {{concerned}} that Communist North Korea might have underway a nuclear weapons development program. This gave way to alarm when that country refused to allow full inspection of nuclear sites. In November 1993 North Korea demanded that the United States and South Korea cancel a planned joint training exercise as a precondition during discussions on the <b>nuclear</b> <b>issue.</b> Aspin rejected this demand and announced that the United States would suspend plans to withdraw its troops gradually from the peninsula.|$|E

25|$|The author {{analyzes}} the strategies {{available to the}} U.S. {{to deal with the}} Iran nuclear situation both diplomatically and militarily, and argues combat would not be feasible. Nance warns that war with Iran in order to potentially limit their nuclear capabilities would lead to financial ruin in America, retaliatory strikes against Israel, increased oil values, conflict by Iran with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and closure of shipping lanes for oil. Nance acknowledges that Iran contributes significantly to supporting terrorists activities around the planet, {{but at the same time}} argues that a peaceful resolution to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>issue</b> with the country is worthy of seeing if it can come to fruition.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Ban {{replaced}} Yoon Young-kwan {{as foreign}} minister of South Korea under president Roh Moo-hyun. At {{the beginning of his}} term, Ban was faced with two major crises: in June 2004 Kim Sun-il, a South Korean working as an Arabic translator, was kidnapped and killed in Iraq by Islamic extremists; and in December 2004 dozens of Koreans died in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Ban survived scrutiny from lawmakers and saw an upturn in his popularity when talks began with North Korea. Ban became actively involved in issues relating to North-South Korean relationships. In September 2005, as foreign minister, he played {{a leading role in the}} diplomatic efforts to adopt the Joint Statement on resolving the North Korean <b>nuclear</b> <b>issue</b> at the Fourth Round of the Six-party talks held in Beijing.|$|E
25|$|President Lee {{also held}} {{bilateral}} summits {{with the leaders}} of the United States, Japan, and People's Republic of China to discuss North Korean affairs. In the wake of the ROKS Cheonan sinking, a joint declaration was issued by the G-8 leaders condemning the North. President Lee succeeded in bringing the Cheonan incident to the forefront in the Chair's Statement for the Asia-Europe Meeting in 2010 at Brussels, drawing member nation support for the South Korean government's stance on North Korea's <b>nuclear</b> <b>issue</b> and stability in Northeast Asia. In addition, President Lee urged Japanese Prime Minister Kan Naoto to put his words on 15 August, Korea's Liberation Day into action. Regular reunions of the families separated by the Korean War drew attention as an international issue after being included in the Chair's Statement.|$|E
