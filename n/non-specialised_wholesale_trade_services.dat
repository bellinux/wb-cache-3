30|$|The {{third row}} and below show the {{estimation}} results by sector. As mentioned in Section  2, most municipalities use this {{program in the}} agricultural and tourism sectors. As predicted, the estimation {{results indicate that the}} place-based job creation program increases the number of workers in the agricultural sector by approximately 11 %. The program affects the agricultural sector most positively. The program increases the number of workers in the <b>wholesale,</b> retail <b>trade,</b> and <b>service</b> sector by approximately 5 %, as shown in column (1) and column (2), respectively, which are smaller (but positive) effects than those in the agricultural sector. If the model controls for the unemployment rate in the base year, the effect is insignificant, but it is significant in municipalities with a lower aging rate or larger working age population size, as shown later. Employment in the agricultural sector increases through the rising sale of agricultural specialties via this program’s promotion or via rising demand for a supply of new local brands. Sometimes, female farmers start to work for a new local brand. Employment in the <b>wholesale,</b> retail <b>trade,</b> and <b>service</b> sectors increases through job training in concierge services or information technology skills. By contrast, the program does not affect the manufacturing and financial sectors as predicted. The coefficients are insignificant from column (1) to column (3). Additionally, these results indicate that the program does not induce a transfer from the manufacturing or financial sectors to the agricultural or <b>wholesale,</b> retail <b>trade,</b> and <b>service</b> sectors.|$|R

Relative shares show the share of a sector in one country with respect to the share of that sector in the entire EU, so countries with sectors that have high relative shares show an advantage in the production of the goods of that sector. 13 Own calculations of sector shares in the EU with 2005 Eurostat data showed that the sectors with the highest shares were construction, real-estate, <b>wholesale</b> <b>trade,</b> other business <b>services,</b> food and beverages, chemicals, health and social work, public administration and defense, and motor vehicles. The most common sectors with the highest shares in European countries were construction, real-estate, <b>wholesale</b> <b>trade,</b> other business <b>services,</b> food and beverages, chemicals, health and social work, public administration, motor vehicles, and machinery and equipment. Our results are in line with European Comission (a), which shows that the sectors with the highest shares in EU GDP are other business services, health and social work, construction, public administration, financial intermediation, <b>wholesale</b> <b>trade,</b> real-estate, education, retail <b>trade,</b> and other <b>services.</b> Secondly, the sectors with the highest relative shares in most countries are crude oil and natural gas, radio television and communication equipment, office machinery and computers, wearing apparel and furs, forestry and logging, electrical machinery and apparatus, metal ores, and basic metals.|$|R
40|$|Evidence mounts {{that the}} nation has already begun its {{recovery}} {{from one of the}} mildest recessions on record. The first quarter GDP estimates report a spectacular gain. Not all signals are that clear. The recession itself has been labeled a manufacturing recession. Manufactu ring output fell longer and farther than it had in the 1990 - 1991 recession. The impact of the recent manufacturing recession was spotty. Even within manufacturing, some sectors were hit hard, generally those in the durables area. Others, generally in the nondurables portion, remained unaffected. The services sector held up well with only a small decrease in total activity; however, the impact of the downturn was spotty within the sector, as well. Services related to travel were hard hit, while health care services were virtually unscathed. Difficulties in internet-based businesses negatively impacted the business services area. Nebraska weathered the national recession well. As a whole, the state did not experience a downturn, but did see a decrease in overall economic growth rates. Total nonfarm employment in 2001 remained at the 2000 level. Nonfarm personal income grew 3. 4 percent and net taxable retail sales increased 2. 9 percent-small increases overthe inflation rate as measured by the U. S. Consumer Price Index (CPI). Net farm income increased 21 percent over a dreary performance in 2000, adding to Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s economic stability.

The indicator is built on a two-step regression-based approach. First, we estimate an equation for the quarterly GDP growth rate based on coincident and leading series. Second, we estimate monthly and/or quarterly equations which {{will be used to}} forecast the coincident and leading series showing a lead of less than six months.

30|$|This {{paper has}} three purposes. First, {{empirical}} evaluations of job creation have rarely {{been conducted in}} Japan. The {{results show that the}} program increases the number of workers, especially workers commuting to the municipalities conducting the programs, and the program induces a net population inflow. Furthermore, the programs remarkably affect the agricultural sector and the <b>wholesale,</b> retail <b>trade,</b> and <b>service</b> sector, in which most municipalities conduct trial businesses or seminars via these programs. Intuitively, the joining together of the local firms, municipal government, members conducting this program, job placement offices, and job seekers, all owing to the launch of this program, is a key factor in increasing employment.|$|R
40|$|U. S. Macroeconomic Outlook The U. S. economy {{continues}} to grow at a steady, moderate pace. But, important changes underlie this growth. Federal discretionary spending is contracting while the private economy is growing and continuing its transformation and recovery. A transformation is occurring towards an economy with larger energy and technology sectors and growing manufacturing and agricultural exports. There is also a recovery in the housing sector. This recovery is driving growth in construction employment, household durable goods sales, the home improvement market, the real estate sector and the financial services sector. Steady employment growth and recent improvements in hourly wages also are supporting modest expansion in overall consumer spending. Further, nascent recovery in the European economy will encourage renewed growth in business investment {{over the next few}} years. Yet, a variety of public policy issues are holding back even faster private sector growth. Bond purchases by the Federal Reserve Bank will be curtailed late this year as the federal government completes fiscal contraction via its Sequester budget cuts. Declining bond purchases will replace the current fiscal drag with a monetary drag on growth. Both efforts are required for long-term macroeconomic stability and investor confidence but will provide a modest drag on current growth.

There are no data about wages or housing costs at the municipality level in the treatment and control groups. However, instead of wages, this paper discusses sales volume in Section  4. In addition, housing costs might not increase dramatically because the population decreases at the national level, and the treatment and control groups are in rural areas.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{context of}} Hong Kong has nurtured {{numerous}} {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) {{in which the}} owner/managers have exhibited rather consistent set of characteristics over decades despite shifts in the industrial structure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate how such characteristics can sustain in different industrial environments. Design/methodology/approach - By using the competency approach on a sample of 153 SME owner/managers in the <b>wholesale</b> <b>trade</b> and IT <b>services</b> industries, we conducted hypothesis testing on comparing first, the overall rankings of ten competency areas for SME owner/managers, and second, the ratings of individual competency areas between the two industries. Findings - While there are consistent patterns of competencies across these two contrasting industries in Hong Kong, the owner/managers in IT services industry have significantly higher ratings in innovative, strategic and learning competencies than those in the <b>wholesale</b> <b>trade</b> industry. Research limitations/implications - Entrepreneurial competencies are not only stimulated or sharpened by the requirements of different industrial environments, but also rooted in the common socio-cultural background of the owner/managers. Practical implications - With the ever closer economic and socio-cultural integration with China, a completely new pattern of entrepreneurial competencies may be required in a new context of entrepreneurship in Hong Kong. Originality/value - The application of the competency approach allows us to investigate the respective impacts of industrial and socio-cultural factors in the development of entrepreneurial characteristics, particularly those about Chinese SME owner/managers in Hong Kong.

This paper uses as outcomes (1) {{the number of}} workers who live in the targeted city (treatment/control group) and (2) {{the number of workers}} who work in the targeted city. This paper also estimates the effect by sector, including (3) the number of workers in the agricultural sector; the <b>wholesale,</b> retail <b>trade,</b> and <b>service</b> sector; the manufacturing sector; and the financial sector. This paper predicts that we will observe a significant positive effect in the agricultural sector and in the <b>wholesale,</b> retail <b>trade,</b> and <b>service</b> sector because many treated municipalities conduct trial businesses, such as the creation of local brand goods using regional specialty products or the expansion of business opportunities to sell local specialties in these sectors. These programs also implement job training and seminars for local establishments in these sectors. The effect on manufacturing is unclear because the manufacturing sector is weak in many of the treated municipalities. This paper also predicts that we will not observe significant effects in the financial sector because this program does not directly intervene to create jobs in the financial sector. Furthermore, this paper analyzes whether this program induces labor mobility. Therefore, this paper examines the effect on (4) the population, (5) the number of households, (6) the population inflow, and (7) the population outflow. Unfortunately, there are no data about wages or housing costs at the municipality level, especially in the small municipalities where the treatment or control groups are located, while Kline and Moretti (2014 a) argue that housing cost could increase depending on the elasticity of the housing supply. However, the impact of housing costs is minimal in these areas due to the current population decrease in Japan. Some houses become unoccupied because of the decrease in the population.

40|$|AN UNDERACHEIVING ECONOMY A {{number of}} {{positive}} developments {{point to the}} potential for strong {{economic growth in the}} United States in 2013 and beyond. First and foremost, the nascent recovery in the housing sector is driving growth in construction sector employment. Durable goods purchases by households also are rebounding. This rebound is linked to faster rates of household formation and the continued recovery of automobile sales. Further, steady employment growth and recent improvements in hourly wages are supporting a modest expansion in consumer spending. A recovery in revenues is also allowing for a modest expansion of state and local government employment. Finally, an easing of the European debt crisis and re-acceleration of the Chinese economy should encourage renewed growth in exports and business investment over the next few years. These positive factors point to strong growth in the United States economy. Yet, the U. S. economy is likely to disappoint, generating moderate recovery and a slow decline in unemployment rather than rapid economy growth. The reason is that federal policy-makers face too daunting of a task: the need to make difficult cuts in federal spending, and to make them at a gradual, unpopular pace. More precisely, there is a great need to address the budget deficit, but cuts in spending need to be gradual. The U. S. economy can withstand planned cuts in discretionary spending in 2013 but larger cuts in 2013 would be detrimental to growth. As a result, annual deficits will need to remain elevated.

40|$|Standard neoclassical {{models of}} labour demand predict that {{automation}} {{does not produce}} long-term increases in unemployment.

The study utilizes previous work on occupation-level automation probabilities to estimate the impact of automation on Canadian employment over the next two decades. Findings suggest that up to 50 % of Canadian jobs will be at high risk for automation over this time frame. Suggested policies for minimizing unemployment include a nationally coordinated education and skills-training framework, and greater publically-funded assistance for the creation and development of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
