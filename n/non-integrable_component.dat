40|$|This paper {{presents}} a PDE-based approach to finding an optimal canonical basis {{with which to}} represent a nearly integrable Hamiltonian. The idea behind the method is to continuously deform the initial canonical basis {{in such a way}} that the dependence of the Hamiltonian on the canonical position of the final basis is minimized. The final basis incorporates as much of the classical dynamics as possible into an integrable Hamiltonian, leaving a much smaller <b>non-integrable</b> <b>component</b> than in the initial representation. With this approach it is also possible to construct the semiclassical wavefunctions corresponding to the final canonical basis. This optimized basis is potentially useful in quantum calculations, both as a way to minimize the required size of basis sets, and as a way to provide physical insight by isolating those effects resulting from integrable dynamics.

40|$|We {{establish}} the L^ 1 weighted propagation properties for solutions of the Boltzmann equation with hard potentials and <b>non-integrable</b> angular <b>components</b> in the collision kernel. Our method identifies null forms by angular averaging and deploys moment estimates of {{solutions to the}} Boltzmann equation whose summability is achieved by introducing the new concept of Mittag-Leffler moments - extensions of L^ 1 exponentially weighted norms. Such L^ 1 weighted norms of solutions to the Boltzmann equation are, both, generated and propagated in time and the characterization of their corresponding Mittag-Leffler weights depends on the angular singularity and potential rates in the collision kernel. These estimates are a fundamental step {{in order to obtain}} L^âˆž exponentially weighted estimates for solutions of the Boltzmann equation being developed in a follow up work.
