40|$|<b>Nurture</b> Groups are targeted, school based interventions, {{aimed at}} meeting the {{developmental}} needs of vulnerable children {{identified as having}} social, emotional and mental health difficulties. Staffed by two ‘nurturing’ adults, <b>Nurture</b> Groups provide a safe, containing, and highly structured environment to support children’s social and emotional wellbeing, and their capacity to learn and achieve. Past research has focussed {{on the impact of}} <b>Nurture</b> Groups on children’s outcomes, with some highlighting the importance {{of the relationship between the}} <b>Nurture</b> Group practitioner and child. This research aims to explore and explain the practitioner-child relationship, asking <b>Nurture</b> Group practitioners how they make sense of their relationship with the <b>Nurture</b> Group child. The purpose of this research is to identify what makes a successful <b>nurture</b> relationship, and identify factors which challenge it. A symbolic interactionist and critical realist ontological and epistemological position was taken, and a grounded theory methodology adopted. Five <b>Nurture</b> Group practitioners from three full-time, Key Stage 1 <b>Nurture</b> Groups were interviewed. Results revealed a ‘relationship journey’ between the <b>Nurture</b> Group practitioner and child, which develops into a ‘close’ relationship. As the practitioner and child get to know and understand one another, the practitioner becomes attuned to the child’s needs and emotional experiences, enabling them to provide containment to the child and put appropriate support in place. The relationship journey contains a number of challenges, which the practitioner tries hard to overcome. These challenges place a significant emotional load on the practitioner, who in return, seeks containment. However, these challenges contribute towards the development of the relationship, where trust emerges, and a ‘close’ relationship forms. The relationship journey is discussed in relation to psychodynamic and attachment theories, and implications for <b>Nurture</b> Group practitioners, stakeholders and Educational Psychologists explored...|$|R

40|$|<b>Nurture</b> {{groups are}} small, {{discrete}} classrooms on the mainstream school site where two staff, with specific training, deliver individualised programmes {{to students who}} are struggling {{to cope with the}} demands of the mainstream classroom. <b>Nurture</b> group intervention is designed to be both temporary and part-time, with the aim of returning all students to full-time mainstream education as soon as they are ready to engage and succeed. An increasing amount of empirical evidence from the primary phase is suggesting that <b>nurture</b> groups can make a “considerable difference to the behaviour and social skills of children who might otherwise be at risk of exclusion” (Ofsted July 2011). However, empirical research into the development of <b>nurture</b> groups in secondary schools is currently very limited. This study has sought to {{contribute to the development of}} <b>nurture</b> groups in secondary schools in two ways: 1. By investigating the perceptions of professionals, students and parents regarding the practical effects of <b>nurture</b> group provision in the secondary school. 2. By making specific modifications to the <b>nurture</b> group’s Boxall Profile assessment instrument for use with an older age group. The study confirms that secondary school stakeholders perceive <b>nurture</b> groups to be effective in enhancing the school’s continuum of support and in promoting positive student progress.

The debate between nature and <b>nurture</b> proponents about {{which of the two}} is the most important originator of phenotypes has been silent for decades. Instead, a compromise has been reached where everyone has agreed that most if not all phenotypes originate from a combination of nature and <b>nurture</b> influences. In recent years, considerable scientific evidence suggests that during a specific timeframe in very early life, nature and <b>nurture</b> interact with each other by epigenetic mechanisms. <b>Nurture</b> effects on the mother are shown to cause dramatically differing phenotypes in offspring.

The play allows for an acknowledgement of the troubling aspects of the nation’s history of conquest, violence, and greed, by couching the negative implications in a romantic plot. In other words, the romantic conquest helps to soften the harshness and brutality of the colonial conquest. The success of the play reflects a larger cultural desire to express its sense of self through the Pocahontas myth.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nurture</b> {{groups are}} {{a form of}} {{educational}} provision to support children with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties (SEBD). Their main aim is to provide children with the basic social and emotional skills, {{in order to facilitate}} learning, through the development of secure attachments in an educational setting (Boxall, 2002; Cooke, Yeomans & Parkes, 2008). The evidence base pertaining to <b>nurture</b> groups in relation to learning and academic outcomes remains relatively limited. A review of the literature highlighted the lack of previous research investigating the impact of <b>nurture</b> groups upon children’s language development, whilst access to the child’s voice remained limited. This research aimed to evaluate the impact of newly established, variant <b>nurture</b> groups upon a group of young children, including their language and literacy skills. In addition, the researcher used a range of methods in order to access the views of these children to assist in fully understanding the impact of <b>nurture</b> groups. Undertaken from a Critical Realist position, this evaluation study employed a mixed-methods design to consider both the outcomes and processes pertaining to <b>nurture</b> groups and academic outcomes. Quantitative measures were utilised to consider the effects of <b>nurture</b> groups upon children’s language and literacy skills, collected both upon entry to the <b>nurture</b> group and again eight months later. For this aspect of the research data was collected from 16 participants, accessing two different <b>nurture</b> groups and ranging in age from 5 years and 9 months to 9 years and 2 months. To contextualise the data, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with the children, to explore their experiences of <b>nurture</b> groups and support understanding of the intervening processes affecting children’s learning. A total of 8 participants, half of the original cohort, contributed to this phase. Four participants were drawn from each school and the final sample consisted of three girls and five boys, drawn from key stages one and two. Findings demonstrated that the children’s language and literacy skills showed improvement following access to the <b>nurture</b> group. Whilst this was not always at a significant level, some progress was evident, although the results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and the variance within the group. The qualitative data provided further evidence to support these results, identifying that children perceived a positive impact upon their language and literacy skills, whilst a change was also apparent in their confidence and their readiness to learn. Supportive and valued features of the <b>nurture</b> groups were identified which can be linked to key elements of the provision, suggesting the importance of developing attachment relationships and social interaction for facilitating learning. The findings are important in highlighting the potential of <b>nurture</b> groups for improving academic attainment alongside social and emotional development and Educational Psychologists are well placed to encourage understanding of the role of <b>nurture</b> groups in laying the foundations for learning, supporting schools to develop <b>nurture</b> groups as an effective provision for children with complex social, emotional and behavioural difficulties...|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} the effectiveness {{and role of}} <b>Nurture</b> Groups in addressing children's and older students' self-esteem. It is suggested that self-esteem is nebulous in the field, calling for a re-conceptualisation. In light of existing models of self-esteem, the <b>Nurture</b> Group literature is systematically reviewed to ascertain <b>Nurture</b> Groups' effectiveness in promoting academic self-esteem specifically. Following the application of criteria, eleven quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies are analysed. Findings {{suggest that there is}} limited rigorous research and an emphasis on younger children. There is little evidence that <b>Nurture</b> Groups lead to increased academic competency and modest evidence of increased academic engagement. Children's reflection on learning cannot be gauged. It is argued that more varied, rigorous research is required and greater clarity needed among <b>Nurture</b> Group staff with regards to group goals and their role in bringing these about. In light of this, <b>Nurture</b> Group staff perspectives on the goals and practice within a Key Stage 3 <b>Nurture</b> Group are explored. Self- esteem is again examined and a multi-dimensional model of the development of self-esteem proposed. <b>Nurture</b> Group staff views are mapped onto this model. Findings highlight that staff view self-esteem as both inherent and as developing through experience, with an emphasis upon the latter. Findings suggest that staff predominantly view their role as impacting on students' self -appraisal, incorporating the specific areas of: personal behaviour management; inter-personal skills; and academic engagement. The study highlights that staff within this <b>Nurture</b> Group address self-esteem within these domains in several capacities, to differing extents. Suggested implications for staff are: the requirement to adhere to a rnulti-dirnenslonal model of self- esteem; the need to promote students' academic self-esteem in particular; as well as to work closely with students' social contexts. Findings have implications for training and practice and are therefore pertinent for pastoral managers and decision-makers. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
