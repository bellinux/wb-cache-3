50|$|Whilst at Princeton, Porkolab {{concentrated}} on disperive properties of plasma waves and instabilities in magnetized plasmas. Measurements corroborating {{the validity of}} the collisionless Boltzmann equation and demonstrating <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scattering</b> of Bernstein waves with wavelengths comparable to the electron Larmor radius were obtained. Porkolab's work provided experimental verifications of Landau damping, nonlinear resonant wave-wave scattering and parametric instabilities, also predicting upper hybrid solitons. From 1977, whilst at the MIT Physics Department, Porkolab joined the newly established Plasma Physics and Fusion Center where he began experiments on lower hybrid current drive in tokamak plasmas. He also carried out investigations on ion cyclotron heating and mode conversion processes in multi-ion species fusion plasmas. Phase contrast imaging (PCI) was developed by Porkolab's group both for use at the Alcator C-Mod tokamak and the DIII-D tokamak of General Atomics, in San Diego. In recent years, PCI measurements contributed to the advanced in understanding of turbulence and Alfvén wave phenomena.|$|E

The angular distribution of the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scattered</b> harmonic light presents narrow peaks. These peaks are shown to result from the nonlinear interaction of the pump field with the guided modes at pump frequency excited by the roughness of the thin film.

30|$|Effects of <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scattering</b> {{phenomena}} such as Raman and Brillouin scattering {{cannot be}} modeled as simply {{as those of}} surface roughness scattering because the loss coefficient {{is dependent on the}} light intensity in these cases. As argued above, these <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scattering</b> effects can be safely ignored in integrated bus waveguides because the field intensities for CQFC applications are typically too small for these effects to be significant. However in resonant structures, especially those constructed to specifically behave in a nonlinear fashion (e.g., integrated-optics implementations of an OPO), <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scattering</b> effects must be taken into account. Since the underlying scattering mechanisms ultimately arise from interactions with crystal phonons, they can be modeled fully quantum mechanically ([72], Sections  6.4. 1, 11.6). As these models show, such scattering produces incoherent loss or gain of population in the modes of interest, as well as phase decoherence. Most significantly for the CQFC framework, only in some special situations can these phenomena be modeled by a coupling to a Markovian reservoir [72], which means that in most cases the effects of these <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scattering</b> processes cannot be modeled within the standard SLH formalism. Accurately incorporating these <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scattering</b> processes within the SLH formalism is an avenue for future work.|$|E

40|$|Many {{carbon based}} {{nanomaterials}} exhibit nonlinear optical response {{over a large}} wavelength range when irradiated with intense laser light what makes them promising candidates for optical limiting purposes. Besides nonlinear absorption some of these well studied nanostructures like carbon nanotubes or carbon black owe their prominent limiting efficiency particularly to induced <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scattering.</b> In this paper, our investigations on carbon nanohorns are presented—a new and very promising nonlinear optical material. It offers excellent properties like a low optical limiting threshold and a high nonlinear attenuation when tested with nanosecond laser pulses at wavelengths of 532 nm or 1064 nm. At moderate irradiation levels near the nonlinear threshold our measurements performed on colloidal carbon nanohorns reveal broadband nonlinear absorption as the dominant optical limiting effect.

We discuss the contributions of different nonlinear sources, and the effect of the low-order optical Mie modes on the characteristics of the generated far-field. We demonstrate that the multipolar expansion of the radiated field is dominated by dipolar and quadrupolar modes (two axially symmetric electric quadrupoles, an electric dipole, and a magnetic quadrupole), and the interference of these modes can ensure directivity of the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scattering.</b> The developed multipolar analysis can be instructive for interpreting the far-field measurements of the <b>nonlinear</b> <b>scattering,</b> and it provides prospective insights into a design of CMOS-compatible nonlinear nanoantennas fully integrated with silicon-based photonic circuits, as well as new methods of nonlinear diagnostics.
