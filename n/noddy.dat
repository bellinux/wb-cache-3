5|$|After 1963 Blyton's output was {{generally}} confined to {{short stories and}} books intended for very young readers, such as Learn to Count with <b>Noddy</b> and Learn to Tell Time with <b>Noddy</b> in 1965, and Stories for Bedtime and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend. Blyton published her last book in the <b>Noddy</b> series, <b>Noddy</b> and the Aeroplane, in February 1964. In May the following year she published Mixed Bag, a song book with music written by her nephew Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, The Man Who Stopped to Help and The Boy Who Came Back.|$|E
5|$|Bestime {{released}} the Little <b>Noddy</b> Car Game in 1953 and the Little <b>Noddy</b> Leap Frog Game in 1955, and in 1956 American manufacturer Parker Brothers released Little Noddy's Taxi Game, a board game which features <b>Noddy</b> driving about town, picking up various characters. Bestime released its Plywood <b>Noddy</b> Jigsaws series in 1957 and a <b>Noddy</b> jigsaw series featuring cards appeared from 1963, with illustrations by Robert Lee. Arrow Games became the chief producer of <b>Noddy</b> jigsaws {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s. Whitman manufactured four new Secret Seven jigsaw puzzles in 1975, and produced four new Malory Towers ones two years later. In 1979 the company released a Famous Five adventure board game, Famous Five Kirrin Island Treasure. Stephen Thraves wrote eight Famous Five adventure game books, published by Hodder & Stoughton in the 1980s. The first adventure game book of the series, The Wreckers' Tower Game, was published in October 1984.|$|E
5|$|<b>Noddy</b> {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in the Sunday Graphic in 1949, {{the same year as}} Blyton's first daily <b>Noddy</b> strip for the London Evening Standard. It was illustrated by van der Beek until his death in 1953.|$|E
50|$|Nelson Island {{has been}} {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International. Birds for which the island is of conservation significance include lesser <b>noddies</b> (13,700 breeding pairs) and brown <b>noddies</b> (8300 pairs).|$|R
50|$|Great {{frigatebirds}} {{will also}} hunt seabird chicks at their breeding colonies, taking mostly the chicks of sooty terns, spectacled terns, brown <b>noddies</b> and black <b>noddies.</b> Studies show that only females (adults and juveniles) hunt in this fashion, {{and only a}} few individuals account for most of the kills.|$|R

5|$|Though no {{terrestrial}} {{birds are}} {{found on the}} atoll, Ducie Island is known for the seabirds that breed there. Birds that have been recorded nesting on the atoll include the red-billed tropicbird, red-tailed tropicbird, fairy tern, great frigatebird, bristle-thighed curlew, masked booby and red-footed booby. A number of gull species, including the sooty tern, blue <b>noddy,</b> brown <b>noddy,</b> lesser <b>noddy</b> and white tern, have been recorded, as have {{several members of the}} Procellariidae family: Kermadec petrel, Trindade petrel, Murphy's petrel and Christmas shearwater.|$|E
5|$|To address criticisms {{levelled}} at Blyton's work some later editions {{have been}} altered to reflect more liberal attitudes towards {{issues such as}} race, gender and the treatment of children; modern reprints of the <b>Noddy</b> series substitute teddy bears or goblins for golliwogs, for instance. The golliwogs who steal Noddy's car and dump him naked in the Dark Wood in Here Comes <b>Noddy</b> Again are replaced by goblins in the 1986 revision, who strip <b>Noddy</b> only of his shoes and hat and return {{at the end of}} the story to apologise.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's <b>Noddy,</b> about {{a little}} wooden boy from Toyland, first {{appeared}} in the Sunday Graphic on 5 June 1949, and in November that year <b>Noddy</b> Goes to Toyland, the first of at least two dozen books in the series, was published. The idea was conceived by one of Blyton's publishers, Sampson, Low, Marston and Company, who in 1949 arranged a meeting between Blyton and the Dutch illustrator Harmsen van der Beek. Despite having to communicate via an interpreter, he provided some initial sketches of how Toyland and its characters would be represented. Four days after the meeting Blyton sent the text of the first two <b>Noddy</b> books to her publisher, to be forwarded to van der Beek. The <b>Noddy</b> books became one of her most successful and best-known series, and were hugely popular in the 1950s. An extensive range of sub-series, spin-offs and strip books were produced throughout the decade, including Noddy's Library, Noddy's Garage of Books, Noddy's Castle of Books, Noddy's Toy Station of Books and Noddy's Shop of Books.|$|E

This research provides baseline breeding population estimates for nine of 16 islands in the Capricornia Group over five years for Shearwaters (1996 - 2000) and four years for <b>Noddies</b> (1997 - 2000). With estimates of ~ 302 000 active breeding pairs of Black <b>Noddies</b> and ~ 560 000 breeding pairs of Wedge-tailed Shearwaters in the area, the research results have confirmed {{the importance of the}} Capricornia Group as a recognised breeding area for these birds.

5|$|The Enid Blyton Trust for Children was {{established}} in 1982 with Imogen as its first chairman, and in 1985 it established the National Library for the Handicapped Child. Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine began publication in September 1985, and on 14 October 1992 the BBC began publishing <b>Noddy</b> Magazine and released the <b>Noddy</b> CD-Rom in October 1996.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 Blyton adapted <b>Noddy</b> for the stage, {{producing}} the <b>Noddy</b> in Toyland pantomime {{in just two}} or three weeks. The production was staged at the 2660-seat Stoll Theatre in Kingsway, London at Christmas. Its popularity resulted in the show running during the Christmas season {{for five or six}} years. Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience, and attended the theatre {{three or four times a}} week. TV adaptations of <b>Noddy</b> since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by Richard Briers. In 1955 a stage play based on the Famous Five was produced, and in January 1997 the King's Head Theatre embarked on a six-month tour of the UK with The Famous Five Musical, to commemorate Blyton's centenary. On 21 November 1998 The Secret Seven Save the World was first performed at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|Many of Blyton's series, {{including}} <b>Noddy</b> and The Famous Five, {{continued to}} be successful in the 1960s; by 1962, 26 million copies of <b>Noddy</b> had been sold. Blyton concluded several of her long-running series in 1963, publishing the last books of The Famous Five (Five Are Together Again) and The Secret Seven (Fun for the Secret Seven); she also produced three more Brer Rabbit books with the illustrator Grace Lodge: Brer Rabbit Again, Brer Rabbit Book, and Brer Rabbit's a Rascal. In 1962 many of her books {{were among the first to}} be published by Armada Books in paperback, making them more affordable to children.|$|E

5|$|Blyton's granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new <b>Noddy</b> book to {{celebrate}} the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; <b>Noddy</b> and the Farmyard Muddle (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall. In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, Mr Tumpy's Caravan, was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories, National Centre for Children's Books {{in a collection of}} papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death. It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.|$|E
5|$|Blyton capitalised {{upon her}} {{commercial}} success {{as an author}} by negotiating agreements with jigsaw puzzle and games manufacturers from the late 1940s onwards; by the early 1960s some 146 different companies were involved in merchandising <b>Noddy</b> alone. In 1948 Bestime released four jigsaw puzzles featuring her characters, and the first Enid Blyton board game appeared, Journey Through Fairyland, created by BGL. The first card game, Faraway Tree, appeared from Pepys in 1950. In 1954 Bestime released the first four jigsaw puzzles of the Secret Seven, and the following year a Secret Seven card game appeared.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's work became {{increasingly}} controversial among literary critics, {{teachers and parents}} from the 1950s onwards, because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books, particularly the <b>Noddy</b> series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit. Her books have been criticised as being elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic and {{at odds with the}} more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.|$|E

5|$|Enid Mary Blyton (11 August 1897– 28 November 1968) was an English children's writer whose {{books have}} been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies. Blyton's books are still {{enormously}} popular, and have been translated into 90 languages; her first book, Child Whispers, a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922. She wrote {{on a wide range of}} topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her <b>Noddy,</b> Famous Five, and Secret Seven series.|$|E

5|$|During {{the months}} {{following}} her husband's death Blyton became increasingly ill, {{and moved into}} a nursing home three months before her death. She died at the Greenways Nursing Home, Hampstead, North London, on 28 November 1968, aged 71. A memorial service was held at St James's Church, Piccadilly, and she was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, where her ashes remain. Blyton's home, Green Hedges, was auctioned on 26 May 1971 and demolished in 1973; the site is now occupied by houses and a street named Blyton Close. An English Heritage blue plaque commemorates Blyton at Hook Road in Chessington, where she lived from 1920 to 1924. In 2014 a plaque recording her time as a Beaconsfield resident from 1938 until her death in 1968 was unveiled in the town hall gardens, next to small iron figures of <b>Noddy</b> and Big Ears.|$|E
5|$|External parasites include chewing lice of {{the genus}} Saemundssonia, feather lice and fleas such as Ceratophyllus borealis. Lice are often host specific, and the closely related common and Arctic terns carry quite {{different}} species. Internal parasites include the crustacean Reighardia sternae, and tapeworms such as Ligula intestinalis {{and members of the}} genera Diphyllobothrium and Schistocephalus. Terns are normally free of blood parasites, unlike gulls that often carry Haemoproteus species. An exception is the brown <b>noddy,</b> which sometimes harbours protozoa of that genus. In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as being infected with avian influenza, the H5N3 variant being found in an outbreak involving South African birds. Several species of terns have been implicated as carriers of West Nile virus.|$|E
5|$|Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky {{areas on}} coasts and islands. The yellow-billed, large-billed, and black-fronted terns breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also {{sometimes}} use inland locations. The marsh terns, Trudeau's tern and some Forster's terns nest in inland marshes. The black <b>noddy</b> {{and the white}} tern nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees. Migratory terns move to the coast after breeding, and most species winter near land, although some marine species, like the Aleutian tern, may wander far from land. The sooty tern is entirely oceanic when not breeding, and healthy young birds are not seen on land {{for up to five}} years after fledging until they return to breed. They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot rest on the sea. Where they spend the years prior to breeding is unknown.|$|E
