25|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} Marcia Clark {{published a}} book about the case titled Without a Doubt (1998). Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation. She concluded that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> saved her case, given the defense's strategy of highlighting racial issues related to Simpson and the LAPD, and the predominance of blacks on the jury. In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should have easily convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity.|$|E

During his illness Angela's friends began to raise money, initially with the aim of purchasing a sofa for the visitors' lounge in the hospital where John was treated. <b>Nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> prepared them for the way their original calendar took off.

25|$|In the end, {{the inquiry}} had a larger {{focus on the}} crews of the San Juan and S.C.T. Dodd. After {{interviewing}} survivors, it became disputed whether the crew acted appropriately towards the disaster or not. Turner claimed that either way, <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been done to help passengers survive the sinking as {{there was no time}} for action. First Officer Charles Tulee of the San Juan reported a similar statement to the inquiry. The inquiry claimed the San Juan had veered off course. Third Officer Robert Papenfuss of the San Juan, despite having claimed the S.C.T. Dodd had been the ship which veered off course, was found guilty of negligence, leading to his license being revoked. Evidence surfaced after the inquiry's conclusion, proving that the S.C.T. Dodd had veered off course rather than San Juan, proving Papenfuss' innocence.|$|E

The writer added that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> made the wedding more entertaining because it had [...] "a congregation of jilted ex-lovers, an illegitimate child and a very dodgy motor." [...] A fellow columnist from Inside Soap later named Frank's proposal of marriage to Bobby as [...] "golden moment in soap". They said that [...] "there was never a soap romance more turbulent as Frank Morgan and Bobby Simpson's". They opined that Bobby had always fought a losing battle to win Frank's love and that admitted their sadness that [...] "the tale turned sour".|$|E
500|$|Adler {{arrived in}} London with few contacts. In Whitechapel, {{the center of}} Jewish London at that time, he {{encountered}} extremes of poverty that he describes as exceeding any {{he had ever seen}} in Russia or would ever see in New York. The quite distinguished Chief Rabbi of the British Empire at that time, Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler, was a relative. Adler's father had him written a letter of introduction in Hebrew, but <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been farther from the rabbi's desires than to assist Yiddish-language theater. Nathan Marcus Adler viewed Yiddish as a [...] "jargon" [...] that existed at the expense of both liturgical Hebrew and the English necessary for upward mobility, and his Orthodox Judaism [...] "could not endure so much as a blessing given on stage, for such a blessing would be given in vain..."; further, he was afraid that the portrayals of Jews on stage would give aid and comfort to their enemies.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1997, Be Here Now {{had sold}} eight million units worldwide. However, the sales volume was largely gained {{in the first two}} weeks of release, and once the album was {{released}} to UK radio stations the turnover tapered off. Buyers realised that the album was not another (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, and by 1999, Melody Maker reported that it was the album most sold to second-hand record stores. In the 2003 John Dower-directed documentary , music critic Jon Savage pinpointed Be Here Now as the moment where the Britpop movement ended. Savage said that while the album [...] "isn't the great disaster that everybody says", he noted that [...] "t was supposed to be the big, big triumphal record" [...] of the period. Q expressed similar sentiments, writing, [...] "So colossally did Be Here Now fall short of expectations that it killed Britpop and ushered in an era of more ambitious, less overblown music". Irish Times journalist Brian Boyd wrote: [...] "Bloated and over-heated (much like the band themselves at the time), the album has all that dreadful braggadocio that is so characteristic of a cocaine user." [...] Reflecting in 2007, Garry Mulholland admitted, [...] "the fact that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> lived up to the fevered expectations that surrounded its release doesn't change the facts. The third Oasis album is a loud, lumbering noise signifying nothing." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the day of}} broadcast, The Mirror {{reported}} that EastEnders producers may have to re-write the episode or run a pre-recorded rehearsal tape rather than {{go ahead with the}} live transmission, as Turner was suffering from the flu and was unable to speak. In the event, Turner recovered enough to appear, though was given permission to whisper her lines if necessary. She was able to deliver her dialogue as planned, however was too ill to appear on EastEnders Live: The Aftermath following the episode. Turner commented that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> stopped her from appearing in the episode, as the cast had worked so hard on it, and it was [...] "such a big part of TV history". Several errors were made during the transmission. Barbara Windsor as Peggy incorrectly called Janine [...] "June" [...] and Maslen stumbled over several of his lines. During the final scene, a camera was visibly jostled, sound became muffled and some zoom shots [...] "misfired". Following Bradley's fall, Wood was observed inserting his fingers into his throat to help him retch. The script called for Wood to be sick, though there was not enough time for him to put the liquid into his mouth, and he stated that a person would put their fingers into their throat anyway, [...] "to get it all out".

2500|$|Although {{the victorious}} Allies of World War I had {{prohibited}} {{the union of}} Austria and Germany, their reaction to the Anschluss was mild. Even the strongest voices against annexation, particularly those of Fascist Italy, France and Britain (the [...] "Stresa Front") were not backed by force. In the House of Commons Chamberlain said that [...] "The hard fact is that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> arrested what has actually happened [...] unless this country and other countries had been prepared to use force." [...] The American reaction was similar. The international reaction {{to the events of}} 12 March 1938 led Hitler to conclude that he could use even more aggressive tactics in his plan to expand the Third Reich. The Anschluss paved the way for Munich in September 1938 because it indicated the likely non-response of Britain and France to future German aggression.|$|E

2500|$|Although Lassalle was {{a member}} of the Communist League, his {{politics}} were strongly opposed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; indeed Marx's essay Critique of the Gotha Program is written in part as a reaction to Lassalle's conception of the socialist state. [...] Marx and Engels thought that Lassalle was not a true Communist as he directly influenced Bismarck's government (albeit in secret) in favor of universal manhood suffrage, among other issues. In February 1864 Lassalle wrote to Engels, claiming that he although had been a republican since infancy [...] "I have never found anything as ridiculous, corrupt, and in the long run impossible as constitutionalism ... I have come to the conviction that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a greater future or a more beneficent role than the monarchy, if it could only make up its mind to become a social monarchy.

2500|$|The battle also {{significantly}} shifted American opinion. During the battle, many Americans accepted the view promoted by Joseph Kennedy, the American ambassador in London, {{who believed that}} the United Kingdom could not survive. Roosevelt wanted a second opinion, and sent [...] "Wild Bill" [...] Donovan on a brief visit to the UK; he became convinced the UK would survive and should be supported in every possible way. Before {{the end of the}} year American journalist Ralph Ingersoll, after returning from Britain, published a book concluding that [...] "Adolf Hitler met his first defeat in eight years" [...] in what might [...] "go down in history as a battle as important as Waterloo or Gettysburg". The turning point was when the Germans reduced the intensity of the Blitz after 15 September. According to Ingersoll, [...] " [...] majority of responsible British officers who fought through this battle believe that if Hitler and GÃ¶ring had had the courage and the resources to lose 200 planes a day for the next five days, <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> saved London"; instead, [...] " [...] morale in combat is definitely broken, and the RAF has been gaining in strength each week." ...|$|E

ComÄneci later stated in her memoir that her response of [...] "so what?" [...] to a reporter's comment that Panait was married was due to her poor command of the English language at the time:Constantin had offered to help me defect, and I'd accepted. I assumed that his wife knew that he was going to help a handful of Romanians get out of the country and that I was one of them. But what people took from my answer was that I was a home-wrecker. <b>Nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been further from the truth. In hindsight, I understand that I'd made a very poor choice of words. Constantin had plans to become my personal manager upon our arrival in the United States. I didn't know that, but he promised to help me get settled, and I guess I just accepted his involvement in my future career as fair payment for the risks he'd taken.
