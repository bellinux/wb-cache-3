The {{requirement for}} the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements coincided with the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for an airliner capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound diesel engine. Turboprop options were also considered, but they were so <b>new</b> <b>that</b> Bristol could not guarantee the performance specifications.|$|E

25|$|Leopold also {{approved}} and collaborated {{on the development}} of a political constitution, said to have anticipated by many years the promulgation of the French constitution and which presented some similarities with the Virginia Bill of Rights of 1778. Leopold's concept of this was based on respect for the political rights of citizens and on a harmony of power between the executive and the legislative. However, it could not be put into effect because Leopold moved to Vienna to become emperor in 1790, and because it was so radically <b>new</b> <b>that</b> it garnered opposition even from those who might have benefited from it.|$|E

25|$|The {{first use}} in {{action of the}} Il-2 was with the 4th ShAP (Ground Attack Regiment) over the Berezina River days after the {{invasion}} began. The aircraft was so <b>new</b> <b>that</b> the pilots had no training in flight characteristics or tactics, and the ground crew no training in servicing or re-arming. The training received only enabled the pilots to take-off and land; none of the pilots had fired the armament, let alone learned tactics. There were 249 Il-2s available on 22 June 1941. In the first three days, 4th ShAP had lost 10 Il-2s to enemy action, a further 19 were lost to other causes, and 20 pilots were killed.|$|E

His second son Ferdinand became ruler of the Grand Duchy. Leopold himself died in 1792.|$|E
25|$|For a {{majority}} of black women feminism has failed to accurately and holistically describe them as individuals {{to the world that}} surrounds them. They feel as though it takes something <b>new</b> <b>that</b> is not already bound to a predetermined master in order to capture this new movement. Womanism is something that Alice Walker can completely identify with without having second thoughts; it feels natural to her. Feminism does not. When distinguishing between feminism and womanism {{it is important to remember}} that many women find womanism easier to identify with. In addition, a key component of a womanist discourse is the role that spirituality and ethics has on ending the interlocking oppression of race, gender, and class that circumscribes the lives of African-American women.|$|E

25|$|If the proton–neutron {{model for}} the nucleus {{resolved}} many issues, it highlighted the problem of explaining the origins of beta radiation. No existing theory could account for how electrons could emanate from the nucleus. In 1934, Enrico Fermi published his classic paper describing the process of beta decay, in which the neutron decays to a proton by creating an electron and a (as yet undiscovered) neutrino. The paper employed the analogy that photons, or electromagnetic radiation, were similarly created and destroyed in atomic processes. Ivanenko had suggested a similar analogy in 1932. Fermi's theory requires the neutron to be a spin-½ particle. The theory preserved the principle of conservation of energy, which had been thrown into question by the continuous energy distribution of beta particles. The basic theory for beta decay proposed by Fermi {{was the first to}} show how particles could be created and destroyed. It established a general, basic theory for the interaction of particles by weak or strong forces. While this influential paper has stood the test of time, the ideas within it were so <b>new</b> <b>that</b> when it was first submitted to the journal Nature in 1933 it was rejected as being too speculative.|$|E

[...] Only lead single [...] "Tattoo" [...] contains a synthesizer, which was played by Roth.

500|$|Evolve adapts an {{asymmetrical}} multiplayer structure, a {{new concept}} in the video game industry during its development. It was so <b>new</b> <b>that</b> the developer itself worried and wondered why {{no one else was}} working on such project. The design team was also uncertain about whether the 4v1 structure would work or not. According to Turtle Rock, when the publishers heard that the original creators of Left 4 Dead were making a new game, they were interested. However, the design team encountered difficulties when they were pitching the game, and used two months to prepare for the pitching process. According to Robb, publishers were conservative and unsupportive about the idea and [...] " [...] to poke holes" [...] in their pitch. Even though the representatives from these publishers were excited about their pitch after they knew that it would be an extension to the Tank mode in Left 4 Dead, they questioned the ability of Turtle Rock making a triple-A video game, and were uncertain whether it was a project they should invest in.|$|E
500|$|The film drew {{a number}} of {{negative}} reactions from the film critics. Subhra Gupta gave the film a half-star out of five in The Indian Express, saying [...] "After all the shoot-outs and bang-bangs are over, you are left with a film which leaves you with so little <b>new</b> <b>that</b> you wonder if there's any juice left in this style of retro gangsta flick. Or are we heading for a third-time-in-Mumbai-Tibara?" [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 1.5 out of five stars, describing the film as the [...] "equivalent of getting a root canal". He criticised the naivety of the three leads: Kumar for his [...] "in-your-face flamboyance", Khan for playing an [...] "urban rich kid slumming it out at a dress-up party" [...] and both for [...] "rat-a-tat punch lines", but praised Sonali Bendre's cameo as Mumtaz. Mohar Basu gave the film two out of five stars in Koimoi, criticising the melodrama and the [...] "lacklustre chemistry", remarking that the film [...] "lacks the effervescence and naturalness of its prequel".|$|E
500|$|Most {{reviews of}} the pilot were average, {{claiming}} that while it was not bad, it was not great either. Metacritic gave the episode a Metascore—a weighted average based on the impressions of a select 12 critical reviews—of 46, signifying mixed or average reviews. When compared to the original series, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that the spin-off covered the same themes—family, friends, teen melodrama, relationships—but with more humor. Owen praised the compelling characters and the acting, and found the dialogue to be more clever than painful. Adam Buckman of the New York Post commented on the crude language used by the characters, and found there was nothing <b>new</b> <b>that</b> could have surprised him with watching the episode. Ray Richmond of The Hollywood Reporter found that despite The CW's decision not to send out screeners to critics, the pilot was [...] " [...] so horrible after all". Richmond praised the actors and writers, especially returning actor Garth, whom he found looked [...] "terrific" [...] and acted well.|$|E

500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone <b>new.</b> <b>That</b> inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E
500|$|When Chen quit Maxis to re-join Thatgamecompany, {{he did so}} {{knowing that}} it would mean taking less pay and having a less stable career. He felt, though, that it was {{important}} to the industry and medium as a whole to create games that provoked different emotional responses in the player than just excitement or fear. While Chen is not opposed to making action games, and his company has made internal [...] "exciting" [...] games that were well received at Sony, he feels that there is no point to Thatgamecompany commercially producing games like that instead of working for existing game developers, as they would not be making anything <b>new</b> <b>that</b> justified the cost of remaining an independent studio. Similarly, Chen does not intend for Thatgamecompany to make [...] "big budget blockbuster games", as the pressure on profits that entails would stifle the innovation that he wants Thatgamecompany to focus on. Chen believes that for video games to become a mature medium like film, the industry as a whole needs to create a wide range of emotional responses to their games, similar to how film has thriller, romance, and comedy genres based on the emotions they provoke. He feels that there are only three ways for video games to impact adults in the same way they do children: [...] "intellectually, whereby the work reveals a new perspective about the world that you have not seen before," [...] by [...] "emotionally touching someone," [...] and [...] "by creating a social environment where the intellectual or emotional stimulation could happen from other people." ...|$|E
