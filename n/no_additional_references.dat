40|$|In the {{reaction}} of m-aminophenol with carbohydrates in a thiourea/acetic acid reagent, addition of borate sup-presses chromogen formation for hexoses and pentos-es, and enhances it for disaccharides. All reaction prod-ucts absorb maximally at 520 nm. The relatively greater intensity of the m-aminophenol/maltose reaction prod-uct was used in a saccharogenic method for amylase, with low blank readings. This method is compared with two dye/starch procedures. Aniline and its derivatives react with hexoses and pentoses to form colors with characteristic absorp-tion spectra. A mechanism has been proposed {{for this type of}} reaction (1), and an investigation of influen-tial factors has been presented (2). Huitman (3) in-troduced o-toluidine along with 2, 5 -, and 2, 6 -di-methylaniline as analytical reagents for aldosacchar-ides. Earlier, Ek and Hultman (4) introduced the use of m-aminophenol and p-aminobenzoic acid as re-agents for measurement of either glucose or fructose. In spite of the relative advantages cited for m-amino-phenol, I find <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> <b>references</b> regarding its use. Unlike o-toluidine, it was reported as being ap-plicable to whole serum and required only a lO-il sample. In fact, {{it was one of the}} earliest “direct ” mi-cromethods for serum glucose. Perhaps its introduc-tion at the same time as p-aminobenzoic acid as a re-agent for hexoses may have overshadowed its distinct advantages. In this communication, I report observations on {{the reaction}} of m-aminophenol with hexoses, pentos-es, and disaccharides. A study of some factors af-fecting {{the reaction of}} this amine with various carbo-hydrates is presented, along with preliminary data for its use in amylase measurement...|$|E
40|$|Polarimetric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) systems require verification and calibration of their polarimetric performance after launch. Dual-antenna calibration transponders with freely rotatable, linearly-polarized antennas {{are one of the}} most common calibration targets for this task. Because the transponders are used as a measurement standard, any misorientation of the polarization direction of the transponder antennas leads to characterization errors for the SAR instrument. In this paper, we present a novel calibration approach with which the polarization direction of linearly polarized antennas can be accurately determined; <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> <b>reference</b> antenna with a previously known polarization is required. The novel approach will reduce polarimetric transponder calibration errors in the future and will lead to a higher accuracy in calibrated, fully polarimetric SAR systems...|$|R

In this paper two new near-infrared (NIR) based methods were presented; a qualitative and a quantitative method. Both methods {{are based on the}} calculation of net analyte signal (NAS) models which were very easy to develop, specific with respect to the API and required <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> <b>reference</b> analysis. Using a well-mixed batch as a 'golden standard' batch, control charts were developed and used for monitoring the homogeneity of other batches with NIR. The methods were fast, easy to use, non-destructive and provided statistical tests of homogeneity. A mixing study was characterized with the two methods and the methods were validated by comparison with traditional HPLC analysi...|$|R
40|$|The mass {{estimate}} of the d^* (IJ^P= 03 ^+) dibaryon is improved by a dynamical calculation in the quark delocalization, color screening model. The partial decay width of d^* into an NN D-wave state is also obtained. The mass obtained is slightly larger than that obtained in adiabatic calculations, due to the anharmonicity of the effective potential between two Δ's. The value of the width obtained due to tensor one-gluon-exchange is about 5 MeV, comparable in magnitude to earlier results found using pion exchange.

40|$|Lippmann {{interference}} architectures are {{alternatives to}} holographic memories for high capacity data storage. In these systems, the image beam carrying the information data interferes with its reflection onto a mirror. The resulting interference pattern thus records a grating {{in the light}} sensitive material. Several images can be wavelength multiplexed at the same location. On the one side, and just as in holography, {{the number of images}} multiplexed in the same location is given by the wavelength Bragg selectivity of the thick gratings and is thus inversely proportional to the material thickness. On the other side, the page resolution is just diffraction limited and does not depend on this thickness. Each page can thus have a very large data content. Conversely to holography, <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> <b>reference</b> beam is required for recording. This absence of any reference beam simplifies the recording architecture at the expense on stringent requirements on the set-up adjustments. However, the potential numerous advantages of the Lippmann architectures seem to justify these constraints. One of these advantages is the possibility to easily implement an homodyne detection that greatly enhances the detected signals. Such homodyne detection of data pages is presented and discussed here for the first time...|$|R
40|$|After {{long years}} of {{experience}} with Ly-α- and Krypton-hygrometers for flux measurements in different field campaigns, the fast response, open path optical CO 2 /H 2 O analyzer LI- 7500 has been integrated into the boundary layer measurement facility of the MOL both for flux measurements and for long term monitoring of absolute humidity. The device {{has been found to}} be accurate, reliable and stable for relative fluctuation measurements in general with some problems and limitations in detail. Some teething troubles could be overcome with time. Early devices (S/N before 0283) were found applicable for the determination of absolute humidity as well, so that <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> <b>reference</b> measurement appeared to be necessary for flux calculation. Moreover, reference values for QC purposes of other humidity sensors could be generated from LI- 7500 measurements, a great advantage for the design of complex sensor systems and data processing algorithms. Changes in the sensor design by the manufacturer, made in order to fix a problem with CO 2 accuracy, negated the excellent long term specifications with respect to the H 2 O measurements of the devices currently sold. After a period of investigation, solutions seem to be in sight to re-approach to the original system specification. Some of the present device specifics complicate sensor integration into complex measurement systems, which have to be modular, flexible and universal in a multivendor environment...|$|R
40|$|We {{employ the}} ADHM method to derive the moduli space of two instantons in U(1) gauge theory on a noncommutative space. We show by an {{explicit}} hyperKähler quotient construction that the relative metric of the moduli space of two instantons on R^ 4 is the Eguchi-Hanson metric {{and find a}} unique threshold bound state. For two instantons on R^ 3 × S^ 1, otherwise known as calorons, we give the asymptotic metric and conjecture a completion. We further discuss the relationship of caloron moduli spaces of A, D and E groups to the Coulomb branches of three dimensional gauge theory. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branch of SU(2) gauge group with a single massive adjoint hypermultiplet coincides with the above two caloron moduli space.

40|$|Monitoring organic {{environmental}} contaminants is {{of crucial}} importance to ensure public health. This requires simple, portable and robust devices {{to carry out}} on-site analysis. For this purpose, a low-temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) microfluidic potentiometric device (LTCC/μPOT) was developed {{for the first time}} for an organic compound: sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Sensory materials relied on newly designed plastic antibodies. Sol–gel, self-assembling monolayer and molecular-imprinting techniques were merged for this purpose. Silica beads were amine-modified and linked to SMX via glutaraldehyde modification. Condensation polymerization was conducted around SMX to fill the vacant spaces. SMX was removed after, leaving behind imprinted sites of complementary shape. The obtained particles were used as ionophores in plasticized PVC membranes. The most suitable membrane composition was selected in steady-state assays. Its suitability to flow analysis was verified in flow-injection studies with regular tubular electrodes. The LTCC/μPOT device integrated a bidimensional mixer, an embedded reference electrode based on Ag/AgCl and an Ag-based contact screen-printed under a micromachined cavity of 600 μm depth. The sensing membranes were deposited over this contact and acted as indicating electrodes. Under optimum conditions, the SMX sensor displayed slopes of about − 58. 7 mV/decade in a range from 12. 7 to 250 μg/mL, providing a detection limit of 3. 85 μg/mL and a sampling throughput of 36 samples/h with a reagent consumption of 3. 3 mL per sample. The system was adjusted later to multiple analyte detection by including a second potentiometric cell on the LTCC/μPOT device. <b>No</b> <b>additional</b> <b>reference</b> electrode was required. This concept was applied to Trimethoprim (TMP), always administered concomitantly with sulphonamide drugs, and tested in fish-farming waters. The biparametric microanalyzer displayed Nernstian behaviour, with average slopes − 54. 7 (SMX) and + 57. 8 (TMP) mV/decade. To demonstrate the microanalyzer capabilities for real applications, it was successfully applied to single and simultaneous determination of SMX and TMP in aquaculture waters...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a digital three-wavelength holographic interferometer {{based on the}} use of two Wollaston prisms. This provides an in-line setup with quasi common-path and as a consequence there is <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> independent <b>reference</b> wave to be added. Thus, immunity to external perturbations such as vibrations or thermal perturbations is achieved. Furthermore, the set-up exhibits a single shot and real time capability which is very useful to study dynamic events. By using the two Wollaston prisms in an astigmatic configuration, spatial carrier frequencies can be adjusted both in amplitude and orientation. The digital hologram processing is based on Fourier processing and filtering around the carrier spatial frequency so that phase shifting is not required. The use of three wavelengths leads to visualizing directly the zero order fringe and regions {{for which there is no}} air density variation in a dynamic flow. Experimental proof of concept is demonstrated with a supersonic jet when the injection pressure varies...|$|R
40|$|An {{approximate}} neutrino mixing matrix is formutated {{by using}} the standard neutrino mixing matrix as a basis and experimental data of neutrino oscillations as inputs. By using the resulted approximate neutrino mixing matrix to proceed the neutrino mass matrix and constraining the resulted neutrino mass matrix with zero texture: M_ν(1, 1) =M_ν(1, 3) =M_ν(3, 1) = 0, we can have neutrino masses as function of mixing angle θ_ 13 with normal hierarchy: m_ 1 <m_ 2 <m_ 3. By taking the central value of mixing angle θ_ 13 = 9 ^o that gives ϵ= 0. 16 and using the squared mass difference: Δ m_ 32 ^ 2 for normal hierarchy, we then obtained neutrino masses: m_ 1 = 0. 00847 eV, m_ 2 = 0. 01215 eV, and m_ 3 = 0. 05062 eV which can predict the squared mass difference for solar neutrino precisely with the experimental result: Δ m_ 21 ^ 2 = 7. 59 × 10 ^- 5 eV^ 2 Comment: 7 pages, <b>no</b> figure, 3 <b>additional</b> <b>references</b> added, typos correcte...|$|R
40|$|It is a open {{research}} problem {{of great interest}} how to fully utilize the benefits of massive MIMO original designed for Time Division Duplex (TDD) also in Frequency-Division Duplexing (FDD). For efficient multi-user downlink transmission Channel State Information (CSI) has to be obtained at the receiver side and fed back to the transmitter. Due to signaling/pilot overhead scaling {{with the number of}} antennas and the feedback of the CSI the beamforming gain and spatial multiplexing gains of massive MIMO are limited. In this paper we present a novel scheme called User Non-aware Precoding and Effective Channel Estimation (UNP & ECE) for full dimension MIMO in FDD under signaling and feedback constraints. The idea is to construct a large codebook and distribute subsets of it on time-frequency resources as precoded pilots. The same precoders are also used for downlink transmission thus <b>no</b> <b>additional</b> demodulation <b>reference</b> signals are required. This limits the number of signaling overhead and a high quantization of the channel can be utilized. To limit the feedback we show that it is sufficient to report only the strongest stream index of a precoder subset for only a subset of Time Frequency (TF) resources. By sending just the index of the best stream the devices don't require knowledge of the applied precoders. This enables optimization of the codebook construction, the splitting in subsets, the distribution on the TF resources at the base station without awareness at the users...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Existential graphs (EGs) are a simple, readable, and {{expressive}} graphic notation for logic. Conceptual graphs (CGs) combine a logical foundation based on EGs with {{features of the}} semantic networks used in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. CG design principles address logical, linguistic, and cognitive requirements: a formal semantics defined by the ISO standard for Common Logic; the flexibility to support the expressiveness, context dependencies, and metalevel commentary of natural language; and cognitively realistic operations for reasoning by induction, deduction, abduction, and analogy. To accommodate the vagueness and ambiguities of natural language, informal heuristics can supplement the formal semantics. With sufficient background knowledge and a clarifying dialog, informal graphs can be refined to any degree of precision. Peirce claimed that the rules for reasoning with EGs generate “a moving picture of {{the action of the}} mind in thought. ” Some philosophers and psychologists agree: Peirce’s diagrams and rules are a good candidate for a natural logic that reflects the neural processes that support thought and language. They are psychologically realistic and computationally efficient. This is a revised preprint of an article that appeared in the International Journal of Conceptual Structures, vol 1, <b>no</b> 1.

In this paper, we revisit this problem for general spin chains which are invariant under a continuous on-site symmetry group G.

For spin chains with symmetry PSU(N) =SU(N) /Z_N our analysis implies the existence of N distinct topological phases.
