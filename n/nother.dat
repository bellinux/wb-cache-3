After a general study of extremal problems on open subsets of Euclidean space in this setting we introduce the first and second variation of a variational problem.

The concept of association is used to obtain connections to a distributional description of singular variational problems. We study variational symmetries and derive an appropriate version of <b>Nöther's</b> theorem.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop the Lagrangian and multisymplectic {{structures}} of the Heisenberg magnet (HM) model which are then {{used as the basis}} for geometric discretizations of HM. Despite a topological obstruction to the existence of a global Lagrangian density, a local variational formulation allows one to derive local conservation laws using a version of <b>Nöther’s</b> theorem from the formal variational calculus of Gelfand-Dikii. Using the local Lagrangian form we extend the method of Marsden, Patrick and Schkoller to derive local multisymplectic discretizations directly from the variational principle. We employ a version of the finite element method to discretize the space of sections of the trivial magnetic spin bundle N = M × S 2 over an appropriate space-time M. Since sections do not form a vector space, the usual FEM bases can be used only locally with coordinate transformations intervening on element boundaries, and conservation properties are guaranteed only within an element. We discuss possible ways of circumventing this problem, including the use of a local version of the method of characteristics, non-polynomial FEM bases and Lie-group discretization methods. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Thermal inertia {{and thermal}} mass are {{concepts}} that oer means to describe trans-port of heat in nonequilibrium uids. However there are options regarding how {{to separate the}} part of the total ow that caries entropy from the ", nonentropy-bearing part. Some hypotheses are examined and compared for constructing such a eld theory of thermal mass in the energy representation. A global intrinsic symmetry and a nite thermal momentum imply that any formulation which hypothesizes a constant ratio of thermal mass to the entropy must tie the thermal mass to the so-called bare mass of particles, to preserve the global conservation of matter. However, in any formulation consistent with the Grad-Boltzmann theory, where must be variable, the thermal mass behaves as a separate variable governed by the entropy and the second law. Nonetheless, in this case has a reasonably broad plateau of values within which entropy {{is a measure of the}} thermal mass associated with changes of state. Nonlinear transfor-mations linking usual thermodynamic variables with those of the thermal mass frame preserve the components of the tensor of matter, including <b>Nother's</b> energy and pressure. A formula is given for the fraction of the observed mass assignable as thermal mass, in accordance with Grad's solution of the Boltzmann equation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Chaplygin {{proved the}} integrability by quadratures of a round sphere, rolling without {{slipping}} on a horizontal plane, with {{center of mass}} {{at the center of}} the sphere, but with arbitrary moments of inertia. Although the system is integrable in every sense of the word, it neither is a hamiltonian system, nor is the integrability an immediate consequence of the symmetries. On the other hand the constants of motion are obtained as a consequence of a <b>Nother's</b> principle and the system can be related to the geodesic flow on the Euclidean motion group for a left invariant metric. In this paper we analyse the global dynamics and in the process we will explain almost all of Chaplygin's results. At the end of each section we describe in a subsection "Chaplygin" the relation between our text and Chaplygin's. We also obtain several new results, such as the proof that the level sets of the constants of motion in the phase space for the rotational motion are two-dimensional tori on which, after a suitable time reparametrization, the rotational motion is quasiperiodic. After suitable completion of the level surfaces this is also true for the complexified system, which is algebraically integrable in the sense of Adler and van Moerbeke. This also follows, in a quite different way, from Chaplygin's integration in terms of hyperelliptic integrals. Comment: 101 pages.
