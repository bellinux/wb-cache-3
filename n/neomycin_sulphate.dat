40|$|FMRFamide and {{the related}} tetrapeptide FLRFamide are highly {{excitatory}} in molluscan non-cardiac smooth muscle. They are also exceptionally excitatory in the atrium and internally perfused ventricle of Busycon canaliculatum. These two peptides, usually thought of as classic molluscan cardio-acceleratory agents are in fact simply two members of a large and ever growing superfamily, the RFamide family, whose phylogenetic distribution has been so elegantly mapped by Walker [16]. Members of this family, often with extended peptide chains (e. g. penta, hepta and decapeptides), stretch in their known distribution from the cnidaria to the chordates. The effects {{of some of the}} members of this superfamily (FMRFamide, FLRFamide, YMRFamide, TNRNFLRFamide, SDPFLRFamide, LMS) were examined. The neuropeptides were found to be very potent at very low concentrations (10 – 9 M) in the ventricle of both Buccinum and Busycon. Other neuropeptides (HFMRdFamide, SCPb, NLERFamide and pEGRFamide) were found to be without any effect. The Ca 2 + dependency of these neuropeptides was also tested. The peptides appear to induce contraction of the ventricles by release of Ca 2 + from internal pools. The neuropeptides appear to stimulate contraction in these cardiac muscles through a completely different pathway to Serotonin (the main excitatory neurotransmitter for the cardiac muscle). When the peptides were applied together with Serotonin an additive effect was observed clearly indicating the release of Ca 2 + through different pathways.

40|$|During the {{treatment}} of fish diseases, drugs which inhibit the nitrification process can cause acute ammonia toxicity. The same phenomenon can occur when fish are put into a tank without active cultures of nitrifying bacteria. The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify the inhibitory effects of 15 pharmacological agents, which are often used as therapeutic agents in ichthyopathology, on ammonia removal and nitrate production in a simple closed aquatic system. The experiments were conducted in polyethylene bags containing activated biofilters and synthetic water solutions, held in a water bath. Ammonia was added to initiate the nitrification process, and graded concentrations of various pharmacological agents were added. The effects of the pharmacological agents on in vitro nitrification were assessed by monitoring ammonia and nitrate concentrations compared to controls with no added agents, for 24 hours. Graded concentrations of ampicillin (Albipen(R)), chloramine T, enrofloxacin (Baytril(R)), erythromycin, levamisole, methylene blue and polymyxin B induced dose-dependent inhibitions of ammonia removal and nitrate production. The corresponding linear regression curves showed high correlation coefficients and were highly significant (p < 0. 05). The addition of chloramphenicol, copper (II) sulphate, kanamycin disulphate, malachite green, <b>neomycin</b> <b>sulphate,</b> potassium penicillin G, tetracycline and a mixture of trimethoprim and sulphadoxin (Duoprim(TM)) had no significant effects on the nitrification process.

The significant correlation (r = 0. 940; p < 0. 001) between the degrees of inhibition of ammonia oxidation and nitrate production for the various inhibitory pharmacological agents has also been calculated, with a view to validating this method. The data presented suggest that separate tank facilities for hospitalisation or quarantine are necessary when treating diseased fish with ampicillin, enrofloxacin, chloramine T, erythromycin, levamisole, methylene blue or polymyxin B, in order to avoid ammonia poisoning.

Methods We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-centre trial to assess the efficacy of an oral decolonization regimen on intestinal ESBL-E carriage in adult patients with an ESBL-E-positive rectal swab. Fifty-eight patients were allocated 1  :  1 to either placebo or colistin sulphate (50 mg 4 ×/day) and <b>neomycin</b> <b>sulphate</b> (250 mg 4 ×/day) for 10 days plus nitrofurantoin (100 mg 3 ×/day) for 5 days in the presence of ESBL-E bacteriuria. The primary outcome was detection of ESBL-E by rectal swab 28  ±  7 days after the end of treatment. Missing primary outcome data were imputed based on the last available observation. Additional cultures (rectal, inguinal and urine) were taken on day 6 of treatment and on days 1 and 7 post-treatment. The study protocol has been registered with ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 00826670). Results Among 54 patients (27 in each group) included in the primary analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups with regard to the primary outcome [14 / 27 (52 %) versus 10 / 27 (37 %), P =  0. 27].

ATP-dependent 45 Ca 2 + accumulation was shown in this preparation (410 +/- 24 pmol/mg of protein at 150 nM free Ca 2 +) and was inhibited by vanadate (100 microM). Ca 2 + release was effected by Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3, with half-maximal release at 0. 5 +/- 0. 14 microM-Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3, t 1 / 2 11. 2 +/- 1. 1 s. GTP- and guanosine 5 '-[beta gamma-imido]triphosphate (p[NH]ppG) -promoted release of 45 Ca 2 + was demonstrated in this preparation, but the kinetics of release (half-maximal Ca 2 + release at 5. 4 +/- 0. 7 microM, with t 1 / 2 77. 3 +/- 6. 9 s, and at 51. 1 +/- 4. 2 microM, with t 1 / 2 19. 0 +/- 2. 2 s, for GTP and p[NH]ppG respectively), and the ability of <b>neomycin</b> <b>sulphate</b> to block p[NH]ppG-induced release only, are indicative of separate release mechanisms after treatment with these agents. A close association between plasma membrane and elements of the endoplasmic reticulum is indicated in this model, providing a possible mechanism for local alterations in free Ca 2 + in the sub-plasma-membrane region...|$|E
40|$|Third molar surgery may be {{associated}} with a number of complications the most common of which are postoperative pain, swelling and trismus, and dry socket formation. The appearance of these post-operative sequelae is intimately related to the manifestations of inflammation in response to tissue injury. There is significant post-operative morbidity associated with these complications and it was thus the objective of this study to - investigate the effect of a combined antibiotic/anti-inflammatory intrasocket medication on post-operative pain, swelling and dry socket formation. The medication chosen for the study was Covomycin D®. Covomycin D® is a commercially prepared opthalmological preparation - each 1 millilitre contains 2 mg chloramphenicol, 5 mg <b>neomycin</b> <b>sulphate</b> and 0, 5 mg dexamethasone. Nineteen subjects were included in the study after fullfilling certain criteria. All subjects were operated under general anaesthesia by the same surgeon. The patients were blinded {{to the side of the}} medication and were asked to complete a pain visual analogue scale and note the side of the worst swelling in the post¬operative period. All patients were followed up in the first week following surgery by an independent oral and maxillofacial surgeon who was also blinded to the side on which the medication was placed. The results showed a significant difference (p< 0. 6) in the pain experienced on the non-medicated compared to the medicated side on day one in eleven of the nineteen patients (57. 9 %). When the data was analysed over the six day postoperative period sixteen of the nineteen patients (84. 2 %) had significantly less pain on the medicated side compared to the non-medicated side (p< 0. 6). The swelling was reported as being worse on the non-medicated side in fourteen out of the nineteen patients (73. 7 %). Dry socket occurred in three out of nineteen patients or three out of thirty eight surgical extraction sites; an overall incidence of 7. 9 % or an incidence of 0 % for the medicated side and an incidence of 15. 8 % on the non-medicated side i. e. all the dry sockets occurred on the non-medicated side. In conclusion, this double-blinded prospectve study, showed that the use of a combined antibiotic/anti-inflammatory intrasocket medication favourably influences the common adverse post-operative sequelae following the removal of lower third molars.

40|$|The monoacylglycerol 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) {{has been}} {{recently}} suggested {{as a possible}} endogenous agonist at cannabinoid receptors both in brain and peripheral tissues. Here we report that a widely used model for neuronal cells, mouse N 18 TG 2 neuroblastoma cells, which contain the CB 1 cannabinoid receptor, also biosynthesize, release and degrade 2 -AG. Stimulation with ionomycin (1 - 5 microM) of intact cells prelabelled with [3 H]arachidonic acid ([3 H]AA) {{led to the formation}} of high levels of a radioactive component with the same chromatographic behaviour as synthetic standards of 2 -AG in TLC and HPLC analyses. The amounts of this metabolite were negligible in unstimulated cells, and greatly decreased in cells stimulated in the presence of the Ca 2 +-chelating agent EGTA. The purified component was further characterized as 2 -AG by: (1) digestion with Rhizopus arrhizus lipase, which yielded radiolabelled AA; (2) gas chromatographic-MS analyses; and (3) TLC analyses on borate-impregnated plates. Approx. 20 % of the 2 -AG produced by stimulated cells was found to be released into the incubation medium when this contained 0. 1 % BSA. Subcellular fractions of N 18 TG 2 cells were shown to contain enzymic activity or activities catalysing the hydrolysis of synthetic [3 H] 2 -AG to [3 H]AA. Cell homogenates were also found to convert synthetic [3 H]sn- 1 -acyl- 2 -arachidonoylglycerols (AcAGs) into [3 H] 2 -AG, suggesting that 2 -AG might be derived from AcAG hydrolysis. When compared with ionomycin stimulation, treatment of cells with exogenous phospholipase C, but not with phospholipase D or A 2, led to a much higher formation of 2 -AG and AcAGs. However, treatment of cells with phospholipase A 2 10 min before ionomycin stimulation caused a 2. 5 - 3 -fold potentiation of 2 -AG and AcAG levels with respect to ionomycin alone, whereas preincubation with the phospholipase C inhibitor <b>neomycin</b> <b>sulphate</b> did not inhibit the effect of ionomycin on 2 -AG and AcAG levels. These results suggest that the Ca 2 +-induced formation of 2 -AG proceeds through the intermediacy of AcAGs but not necessarily through phospholipase C activation. By showing for the first time the existence of molecular mechanisms for the inactivation and the Ca 2 +-dependent biosynthesis and release of 2 -AG in neuronal cells, the present paper supports the hypothesis that this cannabimimetic monoacylglycerol might be a physiological neuromodulator...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} and persistent infection {{is a common}} cause of impaired wound healing. Generally, non-healing wounds display similar physiological features with regards to mixed bacterial flora, ischemia and production of exudate. The application of topical, broad spectrum antimicrobial compounds embedded in absorbent dressings {{has been shown to}} control bioburden and improve healing. Lyophilised, biopolymeric antimicrobial wafers can offer a contemporary, user-friendly, self-adhesive and effective approach for the management of suppuration and polybacterial contamination {{in a wide range of}} non-healing wounds. Cohesive, non-friable, porous, disc shape wafers were successfully produced with sodium alginate (SA) (18. 17 ± 0. 70 Pa. s), guar gum (GG) (82. 21 ± 5. 41 Pa. s; 95. 87 ± 2. 31 Pa), xanthan gum (XG) (2. 86 ± 0. 12 Pa. s; 23. 61 ± 0. 68 Pa), karaya gum (KAG) (12. 89 ± 0. 93 Pa. s) and an original gel consisting of a blend of a synergistic SA-KAG (7. 75 ± 0. 64 Pa. s; 86. 34 ± 5. 19 Pa) (1 : 1 ratio). Clinical concentrations of the broad spectrum, topical, antimicrobial compounds, <b>neomycin</b> <b>sulphate</b> (0. 5 % w/v NS), chlorhexidine digluconate (0. 5 % v/v CHD), povidone iodine (1. 0 % v/v PVP-I) and silver sulfadiazine (1. 0 % w/v SS) were mixed with compatible biopolymers and appeared to alter the rheological properties of the biopolymers. Rheological analysis of pre-lyophilised gels was undertaken to quantify the flow properties of the gels. The necessity of producing sterile wafers was investigated by exposing all biopolymer-antimicrobial combinations to 25 and 40 kGy of gamma irradiation. Gamma-rays caused total degradation of GG, KAG, SA and SA-KAG, while XG appeared to withstand irradiation. A novel free standing dissolution raft (FSDR) was designed and used to quantify the CHD released from both gels and wafers. CHD released from wafers ranged from 3. 5 ± 0. 01 to 17. 4 ± 0. 39 %. Gels and wafers released CHD in a sustained manner and the release profile of wafers was similar to the respective gels, with the exception of GG. Neither gels nor wafers released 100 % of the incorporated antimicrobial indicating that drug-polymer interactions governed the general performance of antimicrobial wafers, in terms of adhesion, expansion ratio (ER), inhibition ratio (IR), water uptake capacity (WUC) and antimicrobial delivery. Molecular modelling studies undertaken for KAG-antimicrobial complexes demonstrated an unusual ‘Z-shape’ geometry for cationic CHD. The charge and geometry of CHD was plausibly responsible for the antimicrobial’s entrapment within biopolymeric networks. The efficacy of antimicrobial wafers was demonstrated in vitro under simulated conditions of an exuding wound using modified disc diffusion and an original antimicrobial diffusion cell (ADC). All wafers were effective in vitro against common chronic wound pathogens of such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Antimicrobial activity depended on the sensitivity of the microorganisms to a specific antimicrobial compound and the presence of organic material. Data obtained demonstrated that the presence of protein (BSA) in the pseudo-exudate inhibited the antimicrobial activity of CHD and PVP-I, while enhancing the antimicrobial activity of SS and NS against MRSA. The general findings summarised in this thesis conclude that factors such as protein content, electrolyte content and pH of exudate play a key role in the efficacy of self-adhesive, absorbent formulations intended for the topical delivery of antimicrobial compounds to non-healing, infected wounds. Drug-polymer interactions developed between biopolymers and incorporated antimicrobial compounds have a profound effect on the general performance of lyophilised antimicrobial wafers.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to compare the efficacy of six intramammary dry-cow antibiotic preparations for curing existing IMI and for preventing the introduction of new IMI during the dry period. The effect of factors such as parity, milk yield, udder depth, teat canal integrity, number of infected quarters per cow, quarter-site infections and somatic cell count at drying off on cure-rates and new IMI as well as the length of the dry period and rainfall during the dry period were examined. The possible influence of treatment on the SCC during the subsequent lactation was also examined. Prior to the study a herd survey was performed to determine the basic udder health status of the trial herd. Cows due for drying off were clinically evaluated for enrollment and randomly allocated to receive one of the six dry-cow intramammary products under investigation. The six products that were studied were Nafpenzal DC (procaine benzylpenicillin, nafcillin and dihydrostreptomycin), Rilexine 500 DC (cephalexin and <b>neomycin</b> <b>sulphate),</b> Orbenin Extra DC (cloxacillin), Cepravin Dry Cow (cephalonium), Bovaclox DC (cloxacillin and ampicillin) and Dispolac Dry Cow (procaine benzylpenicillin and dihydrostreptomycin). Quarter milk samples were collected at drying off, (prior to treatment), and 1 to 6 days after calving for determination of the SSC and presence of micro-organisms in the milk. Cows were closely observed during the dry period and udders were clinically examined on a weekly basis and post-calving till udder oedema disappeared. Data from 162 cows and 648 quarters are summarized. The following were determined · Prevalence of pathogens at drying off and post-calving · Overall cure-rate and new intramammary infection rate. · Comparative efficacy of dry-cow treatment on cure-rate and prevention of new IMI. · Effect of parity, milk yield at drying off, udder depth, teat canal integrity, SCC, quarter-site infection, number of infected quarters at drying off, length of the dry period and rainfall during the dry period. · Effect of treatment on three SCC post calving during the subsequent lactation. Clinical mastitis developed in two quarters of two cows (1, 03 %) during the dry period which was less than described in literature, and they were removed from the trial. The prevalence of pathogens at drying off was 29, 78 %, of which 7, 87 % and 21, 91 % were due to major and minor pathogens respectively. The prevalence of pathogens post-calving was 22, 22 %, a net reduction of 7, 56 %, of which 4, 47 % and 17, 75 % were due to major and minor pathogens respectively. The overall cure-rate was 83, 94 % for quarters and varied between 72, 3 % and 93, 9 % for the various products. The overall difference in the percentage of cases cured, compared to the different micro-organisms, was found to be only marginally significant (p< 0, 057). High cure- rates were observed for STA, SAG and non-agalactiae pathogenic streptococci compared to studies previously done, while lower cure-rates than described were observed with CNS. Antimicrobial products used in this trial differed substantially in their efficacy to cure Gram-positive IMI. Cure rates for Cepravin Dry Cow was 93, 9 %, Orbenin Extra DC 91, 5 %, Rilexine 500 DC 85, 7 %, Nafpenzal DC 79, 2 %, Bovaclox DC 75, 0 % and Dispolac Dry Cow 72, 4 %. Interestingly, but not of any significance, was an observation that the two products with the highest overall cure-rates both contained only one antimicrobial agent compared to the other 4 products which were combinations of two or more antimicrobials. There was no significant association between parity, milk yield, teat canal integrity, number of infected quarters per cow, quarter-site infections at drying off, length of the dry period and rainfall during the dry period and the cure-rate. However, there was a significant association between udder depth (p< 0, 0056) and SCC (p< 0, 005) at drying off and cure-rate. The cure-rate was significantly less in cows with udder depth scores of 1 and 2 or SCC of more than 750 000 cells per ml milk at drying off. The overall rate of new IMI during the dry period was 17, 44 %. The new intramammary infection rate for quarters which received dry-cow treatment varied between 13, 4 % and 24, 1 % for the different products. The majority (70, 8 %) of new IMI were caused by CNS during the dry period. Almost all (96, 6 %) major pathogens isolated post-calving were new IMI, while 74, 1 % of minor pathogens were new IMI. Antimicrobial products differed in their efficacy in preventing new IMI during the dry period. The percentages of new IMI observed in cows treated with the six products were: 13, 2 % for Cepravin Dry Cow, 16, 3 % for Rilexine 500 DC, 16, 7 % for Dispolac Dry Cow, 17, 3 % for Bovaclox DC, 21, 4 % for Nafpenzal DC and 25, 9 % for Orbenin Extra DC. The probability of quarters developing new IMI during the dry period was significantly increased when cows were dried off with milk yields higher than 18 kg (p< 0, 0037) or had low udder depth (scores of 1 or 2) (p< 0, 0003). Higher parity cows (p< 0, 005) and those that had a teat canal score of 4 (p< 0, 039) and above at drying off were also at an increased risk for new IMI. Marginally significantly (p< 0, 06) more IMI were contracted {{on the left side of}} the udder than the right side of the udder and cows at drying off and cows with dry periods longer than 80 days had marginally (p< 0, 06) more new IMI during the dry period. A positive correlation was found between low SCC (< 250 000 cell per ml milk) and number of infected quarters per cow and parity (less than 3 lactations) at drying off. There was no significant association between the SCC at drying off and new IMI during the dry period. Significantly fewer new IMI (p< 0, 05) were observed when no rain fell during the dry period, compared to cows that experienced rain during their dry period. A comparison between the six antibiotic intramammary dry-cow products in relation to their efficacy in curing existing IMI and preventing new IMI showed qualitative differences between them, ranked as follows: Dispolac Dry Cow was the most effective and Orbenin Extra dry the least effective in preventing new IMI with major pathogens and Cepravin Dry Cow was to most and Nafpenzal DC the least effective in preventing new IMI with minor pathogens. Cepravin Dry cow was the most effective in the overall prevention of new IMIduring the dry period. Due to the random selection of cows the percentage of IMI differed for each product at the start of the trial. To compensate for this initial variation, percentage point improvement from drying off until calving was calculated for each antimicrobial product, taking both the cure-rates and new IMI into account. The efficacy of antimicrobial products during the dry period differed substantially when percentage point improvements were utilised: from an increase in IMI post-calving of 11, 73 % with Nafpenzal DC to a decrease of more than 50 % in IMI at calving with both Cepravin Dry Cow and Rilexine 500 DC. Cows dried off with Rilexine 500 DC had a significantly lower SCC for the first two months post-calving than those dried off with the other five products in this trial. It is concluded that a substantial difference in efficacy exists between antimicrobial intramammary dry-cow products in their ability to cure and prevent new IMI during the dry period. Dry cow therapy should form part of a holistic approach towards the dry period, which also includes cow factors, dry-cow management, micro-organisms and the environment of the dry cow. Cow factors (milk yields, udder depth, parity, TCS and quarter-site infections) mainly have an influence on new IMI but a few cow factors (udder depth and SCC) are associated with the cure-rate of IMI. Management and rainfall during the dry period mainly affected new IMI rather than the cure-rate of existing IMI. Dissertation (MSc (Veterinary Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} withdrawal periods and tissue tolerance of intramammary antibiotics (Curaclox LC, Spectrazol Milking Cow and Rilexine 200 LC) in goats, measured in different ways, and to evaluate the effects of related factors. Method: Three experimental trials were conducted. Trial 1 and Trial 2 were conducted at the Faculty of Veterinary Science, Onderstepoort using the goat herd of the Onderstepoort Teaching Animal Unit (OTAU) (Herd A), while Trial 3 was conducted on a commercial goat dairy in the Limpopo Province of South Africa (Herd B). In addition, four goats with clinical mastitis from a smallholding close to the Faculty of Veterinary Science at Onderstepoort were studied (Herd C). This herd consisted of 13 lactating Saanen and Saanen/Toggenburg crossbred dairy goats. In all trials foremilk was stripped, teats were disinfected and a milk sample was taken from each udder half of each goat (half-milk samples). In all three trials the following milk samples were taken: two sets of half samples and a composite sample (before, during and after treatment). The California Milk Cell Test (CMCT) and conductivity measurements were performed. In Trial 3 the conductivity meter became non-functional on the second day, and thus the conductivity test was eliminated from then on. Each udder half was milked separately and milk volume was recorded. The temperature of goats was taken and recorded to identify sick animals. All goats in the treatment group were treated. In all three trials after treatment, sampling continued until SCC returned to baseline and until there were at least two consecutive negative TRIS tests for each goat, approximately 10 days. Milk production was based on the following milk production groups: low (less than 1. 3 L), medium (1. 3 L to 1. 5 L) and high (greater than 1. 5 L) daily milk production. The antibiotics used in these trials were selected for being commonly used, broad-spectrum preparations. Trial 1, a semi-synthetic penicillin based intramammary preparation (Curaclox LC, which contains 75 mg sodium ampicillin and 200 mg sodium cloxacillin per dose plus blue dye). Curaclox LC G 2615, (Norbrook (Pharmacia AH) P. O. Box 10698 Centurion, 0046), cloxacillin 200 mg, ampicillin 75 mg, blue dye/ 4. 5 g syringe. Trial 2, a cefuroxime 250 mg based intramammary product (Spectrazol Milking Cow, Schering-Plough). Spectrazol milking cow, cefuroxime, 250 mg, S 4 Intramammary Injection 83 / 594, (Schering-Plough Animal Health, P. O. BOX 46, Isando, 1600). Trial 3, a cephalexin 100 mg, <b>neomycin</b> <b>sulphate</b> 100 mg and prednisolone based intramammary product, Rilexine (SA) 200 LC injection 83 / 638, (Logos Agvet (Virbac), Private bag X 115, Halfway House, 1685). Curaclox LC G 2615, Norbrook (Pharmacia AH), cloxacillin 200 mg, ampicillin 75 mg, blue dye/ 4. 5 g syringes. In the clinical mastitis cases (Herd C); Goat 1 was treated with Spectrazol milking cow (as above), Goat 2 was treated with Curaclox LC (as above), Goat 3 was treated with Curaclox LC in the left udder half and Goat 4 was treated with Curaclox LC in the right udder half (as above). Results: Trial 1 : Curaclox LC The mean withdrawal periods for the product Curaclox LC (intramammary) as measured by Thermo Resistant Inhibitory Substances (TRIS), colour dye, Parallux testing for cloxacillin and ampicillin, on eight relatively low producing Saanen dairy goats (Trial 1) were 74 h ± 19. 21; 90 h ± 16. 97; 99 h ± 9. 07 and 93 h ± 11. 41 respectively. The withdrawal period for Curaclox LC recommended for use in cattle (72 h) was significantly shorter than the withdrawal periods as measured by colour dye (P < 0. 001), Parallux testing for cloxacillin (P < 0. 001) and Parallux testing for ampicillin (P < 0. 05) in Trial 1. There was a significant difference of withdrawal periods as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 05) and colour dye (P < 0. 05) between goats with and without clinical mastitis in Trial 1 Trial 3 : Curaclox LC The mean withdrawal periods for Curaclox LC as measured by TRIS, colour dye, Parallux testing for cloxacillin and ampicillin, on 12 relatively high producing Saanen and Saanen-Toggenburg crossbreed dairy goats (Trial 3) were 42 h ± 7. 08; 65 h ± 60. 26; 77 h ± 13. 56 and 71 h ± 12. 65 respectively. The withdrawal period for Curaclox LC recommended for use in cattle (72 h) was significantly longer than the withdrawal periods as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 001) and colour dye (P < 0. 001) in Trial 3. Curaclox LC: Trials 1 & 3 combined The mean withdrawal periods for Curaclox LC as measured by TRIS, colour dye, Parallux testing for cloxacillin and ampicillin, for Trials 1 & 3 combined were 59 h ± 24. 31; 76 h ± 17. 70; 87 h ± 16. 10 and 80 h ± 16. 23 respectively. The withdrawal period for Curaclox LC recommended for use in cattle (72 h) was significantly longer than the withdrawal periods as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 001) in Trials 1 & 3 combined. Trial 2 : Spectrazol Milking Cow The mean withdrawal periods for Spectrazol Milking Cow (intramammary) as measured by TRIS on seven relatively low producing Saanen dairy goats (Trial 2) was 95 h ± 17. 23. The withdrawal period for Spectrazol Milking Cow recommended for use in cattle (60 h) was significantly shorter than the withdrawal period as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 001) in Trial 2. Trial 3 : Rilexine 200 LC The mean withdrawal periods for Rilexine 200 LC (intramammary) as measured by TRIS on 20 relatively high producing Saanen and Saanen-Toggenburg crossbreed dairy goats (Trial 3) was 37 h ± 9. 94. The withdrawal period for Rilexine 200 LC recommended for use in cattle (96 h) was significantly longer than the withdrawal period as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 001) in Trial 3. The regression model for goats with clinical mastitis was: Withdrawal period as measured by TRIS = 30. 21 + 4. 692 (sampling time) + 22. 11 (udder palpation) – 13. 6 (floccules) – 0. 00649 (volume) (R 2 = 95. 7 %, standard error of regression = 3. 41) There was great variation in Somatic Cell Count (SCC) between trials, ranging from 1928 X 103 cells/mL to 9274 X 103 cells/mL for infected udder halves and from 1817 X 103 cells/mL to 3639 X 103 cells/mL for non-infected udder halves, at the morning milking. At the evening milking SCC ranged from 1927 X 103 cells/mL to 6415 X 103 cells/mL for infected udder halves and from 2103 X 103 cells/mL to 3304 X 103 cells/mL for non-infected udder halves. SCC of udder halves with clinical mastitis ranged from 7053 X 103 cells/mL to 7948 X 103 cells/mL for udder halves in which bacteria could not be isolated and from 6476 X 103 cells/mL to 8479 X 103 cells/mL in udder halves from which bacteria was isolated. Most of the variation in SCC was unexplained. In this research all SCC values were determined using the Fossomatic 90 counter and the arithmetic means were reported. The factors valid for determining clinical mastitis were the presence of floccules in the milk and high SCC, with or without udder damage and/ or bacteria. Intramammary infection (IMI) was determined by the presence or absence of bacteria only. Conclusions and Recommendations: The variability in SCC was largely unexplained, and an increased SCC did not necessarily indicate an intramammary infection in goats, as it does in cows. Therefore further, research is required to assess SCC and all possible factors affecting it. Further research is also required to find a more reliable method for mastitis diagnosis apart from SCC, for example, NAGase. The “Goatside” tests used (California Milk Cell Tests, CMCT) and SCC on their own were not reliable methods of mastitis diagnosis and should be accompanied by microbiological tests. However, CMCT and SCC were indicators of tissue tolerance and udder irritation. Tissue irritation is considered to indicate the limit of tissue tolerance. In healthy goats Spectrazol Milking cow caused the least tissue irritation, followed by Rilexine 200 LC, and Curaclox LC. However, for goats with clinical mastitis Rilexine 200 LC caused the least tissue irritation followed by Curaclox LC; and Spectrazol Milking cow caused the most tissue irritation in goats with clinical mastitis. Withdrawal periods of healthy goats and goats with clinical mastitis also differed for each product. Further research is necessary to determine withdrawal periods and tissue irritation of different intramammary products on goats with clinical mastitis. Withdrawal period was affected by volume of milk produced, due to the dilution factor of continuous milk secretion. High producers had shorter withdrawal periods than low producers. However, treatment with intramammary antibiotics did not significantly affect the volume of milk produced. Further research is required to assess the effect of milk production volume on withdrawal periods when comparing withdrawal periods of different products. Antibiotic withdrawal periods on goat milk were different from those recommended for use in cattle for each of the products used and for the different intramammary antibiotics used. The withdrawal periods recommended for use cattle have a 24 h safety margin added to the longest withdrawal period in the trial. In this research 24 h safety margins were not added in the original tables. Therefore, in practice 24 h safety margins should be added to all withdrawal periods in this research. Later the 24 h safety margins were subtracted from the withdrawal periods recommended for use in cattle in order to obtain a rough estimate of the actual withdrawal periods in cattle. In this analysis all withdrawal periods measured by different methods for goats were significantly different from withdrawal periods recommended for use in cattle (- 24 h safety margin). However, in the original tables not all withdrawal periods for goats as measured by different methods were significantly different from those in cattle (with 24 h safety margin). Conductivity was found to be an unreliable “Goatside” test. Dissertation (MSc (Veterinary Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008. Production Animal Studiesunrestricte...|$|E
