5|$|Two main {{measures}} {{are used in}} epidemiological studies: incidence and prevalence. Incidence {{is the number of}} new cases per unit of person–time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person–years); while prevalence is the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> the disease in the population at any given time.|$|E
5|$|Globally about 106 {{million cases}} of {{chlamydia}} and 106 million cases of gonorrhea occurred in 2008. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> PID however, is not clear. It {{is estimated to}} affect about 1.5 percent of young women yearly. In the United States PID is estimated to affect about one million people yearly. A type of intrauterine device (IUD) known as the Dalkon shield led to increased rates of PID in the 1970s. Current IUDs are not associated with this problem after the first month.|$|E

5|$|The exact <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> HIT in {{the general}} {{population}} is unknown. What is known is that women receiving heparin after a recent surgical procedure, particularly cardiothoracic surgery, have a higher risk, while the risk is very low in women just before and after giving birth. Some studies have shown that HIT is less common in those receiving low molecular weight heparin.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} {{moratorium}} on executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 death row inmates who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois death row inmates. Given the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> alleged brutality to be investigated, inmates {{who claimed to have}} been abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{treatment}} {{consists of}} discontinuing medications {{which may be}} contributing. In those who are agitated benzodiazepines may be used. If this is not sufficient, a serotonin antagonist such as cyproheptadine may be used. In those with a high body temperature active cooling measures may be needed. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> serotonin syndrome that occur each year is unclear. With appropriate treatment {{the risk of death}} is less than one percent. The high-profile case of Libby Zion, who is generally accepted to have died from serotonin syndrome, resulted in changes to graduate medical education in New York State.|$|E

5|$|Since first {{coming to}} wide {{notice in the}} late 1990s, the Harry Potter book series by J. K. Rowling has engendered a number of legal disputes. Rowling, her various {{publishers}} and Time Warner, {{the owner of the}} rights to the Harry Potter films, have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyrights, and also have fielded accusations of copyright theft themselves. The worldwide popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them. While these legal proceedings have countered a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> outright piracy, other attempts have targeted not-for-profit endeavours and have been criticised.|$|E
5|$|The exact <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{is difficult}} to establish, because different definitions have been used. In 1995, hospitals in the U.S. reported 26,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis. Up to 85% of people with major traumatic injuries will experience some degree of rhabdomyolysis. Of those with rhabdomyolysis, 10–50% develop acute kidney injury. The risk is higher in people {{with a history of}} illicit drug use, alcohol misuse or trauma when compared to muscle diseases, and it is particularly high if multiple contributing factors occur together. Rhabdomyolysis accounts for 7–10% of all cases of acute kidney injury in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The true <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From the available data, {{carbon monoxide}} poisoning {{is the most common}} cause of injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E

5|$|Due to {{both its}} {{effectiveness}} and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization {{recommended that the}} rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally. Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development. In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen {{a decline in the}} rates and severity of disease. This vaccine may also prevent illness in non-vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections. Since 2000, the implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program in the United States has substantially decreased the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> diarrhea by as much as 80 percent. The first dose of vaccine should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age. The oral cholera vaccine {{has been found to be}} 50–60% effective over 2years.|$|E
5|$|The Calcutta High Court is {{the oldest}} High Court in the country, {{established}} on 2 July 1862. High Courts that handle a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> a particular region have permanent benches established there. Benches are also present in states which come {{under the jurisdiction of}} a court outside its territorial limits. Smaller states with few cases may have circuit benches established. Circuit benches (known as circuit courts {{in some parts of the}} world) are temporary courts which hold proceedings for a few selected months in a year. Thus cases built up during this interim period are judged when the circuit court is in session. According to a study conducted by Bengaluru-based NGO Daksh on 21 high courts in collaboration with Ministry of Law and Justice (India) in March 2016, it was found that average pendency of a case in High courts in India is 3 years.|$|E
