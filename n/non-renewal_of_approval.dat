40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to conduct an {{analysis}} of due process held by selected Indiana secondary school principals. Specifically, the study was to provide an overview of the following: 1. The current status of secondary school principals in regard to due process. 2. The desired status of secondary school principals in regard to due process. 3. The procedures necessary for secondary school principals to obtain due process. Data for the study were obtained through a survey questionnaire which was developed and mailed to 100 randomly selected Indiana secondary school principals. Information for the questionnaire was obtained through the study of instruments reared by professional associations, a review of literature, and known concerns of a select panel of secondary school principals. The information was then embodied into the 31 item questionnaire. Ninety-two useable questionnaires were received and used in the study. Major findings of the study were: 1. Forty-three principals were contracted for one year while sixteen principals held three year contracts. 2. Thirty-four principals reported that notification or renewal or <b>non-renewal</b> <b>of</b> contracts was received on or before April 30 th. 3. Fifty-five principals indicated they did not administer under a written job description. 4. While 25 principals indicated a written evaluation of their job was received, 57 principals indicated the evaluation of performance was verbal or non-existent. 5. Thirteen of the principals indicated the <b>non-renewal</b> <b>of</b> a contract had been experienced and twelve of the thirteen indicated a school board hearing was not granted, an opportunity to defend decision was not given, nor were written reasons for the <b>non-renewal</b> <b>of</b> the contract received by the principal. Major conclusions of the study were: Current Due Process 1. The Indiana secondary school principal lacks statutory recognition that provides for early notice of the renewal or <b>non-renewal</b> <b>of</b> contract. 2. The majority of the principals lack a written job description and two thirds were not involved in the development of the job description. 3. The majority of the principals are not involved in the development of the evaluation instrument. 4. The principals usually are not given a hearing nor an opportunity to defend administrative decisions when faced with <b>non-renewal</b> <b>of</b> the contract. 5. Principals are usually dismissed without receiving the reasons in writing. Desired Due Process 1. Indiana secondary school principals solidly indicated that the most important requirement for due process is sound personnel procedures to channel complaints and the right to provide a fair response. 2. Indiana secondary school principals want the right of early notification when faced with the <b>non-renewal</b> <b>of</b> the contract. 3. The principals want the opportunity to a fair and impartial hearing before the school board prior to receiving a dismissal notice. 4. Principals want the right to be furnished with written, documented charges when faced with dismissal. The following recommendations are based upon the evidence established by research findings and conclusions in this study:The Indiana secondary school principal: 1. Should belong to the Indiana Association of Junior and Senior High School Principals for professional support in the position. 2. Should initiate and support strong legislation which will aid in establishing the entity of the principal and provide a legal basis for clearly marking out the bounds of principal rights and responsibilities and asserting his authority. 3. Should be involved in developing a written job description of performance objectives and criteria which will provide a more objective and less subjective review of the work of the principal. 4. Should be given a yearly evaluation in writing based upon a professional evaluation instrument. 5. Should be given early notice based on Indiana principal law when faced with the <b>non-renewal</b> <b>of</b> a contract. 6. Should be given the opportunity for a fair and impartial hearing before the school board to defend administrative decisions when faced with the <b>non-renewal</b> <b>of</b> a contract. 7. Should be given written, documented reasons, non-arbitrary and non-capricious, when faced with the <b>non-renewal</b> <b>of</b> a contract. 8. Should be given a multiple year contract, renewal each year, to provide stability and security in the principalship. Thesis (Ed. S. ...|$|R
