500|$|On June 3, 1965, President Johnson sent {{a special}} message to Congress, asking it to pass {{legislation}} allowing the dime and quarter to be made from base metal, and to reduce the silver content of the half dollar to 40 percent. [...] The silver dollar would be unaffected if any were struck, {{but there were no}} plans to do so. He noted that the metal for the silver coinage was being struck from dwindling Treasury stocks, rather than from newly mined silver, and that the government bullion would be entirely used up by 1968. Johnson argued that the metal necessary for industry must not be wasted as a means of exchange. He urged the passage of draft legislation, attached to the message, and said the bill would [...] "ensure a stable and dignified coinage, fully adequate in quantity and in its specially designed technical characteristics to the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Twentieth Century life. It can be maintained indefinitely, however much the demand for coin may grow." ...|$|E

2500|$|Miller's primary {{opponent}} was councillor Jane Pitfield. [...] Pitfield criticized city spending, {{and described}} Miller the [...] "Billion Dollar Man" [...] for overseeing spending increases of $1.3 billion since 2003. [...] Miller responded that Toronto's share was only $275 million, {{with the remainder}} coming from the provincial and federal governments. [...] He later described most of the spending as [...] "new investment we've secured from provincial and federal government to meet the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> city in public transit, in housing, or the 58 new child care centres that we've opened in Toronto this month alone, in Toronto's poorest neighbourhoods".|$|E

Miller responded by observing that Toronto's share of the new spending was only $275 million, with the remainder coming from the provincial and federal governments.

The option, though, was deemed a necessity to ensure the financial feasibility of the project. The approved proposal stated: [...] "The Direction has decided to present to the associates {{the construction of a new}} stadium, fully conscious that this is the option that best responds to the earnings and <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Club, being both economically and financially sustainable, and will allow the associates of SL Benfica much better condition in which to follow the club's sporting events, in particular the football team's, and also revive our supporter base." ...|$|E

The package represents a considerable improvement in the offensive capability of the Saudi armed forces. Israel did not raise objections to the sale, {{except to say that}} it was [...] "not thrilled about it." [...] At the time, a senior administration official stressed: [...] "This is a big development, because it's part of a larger regional strategy and the maintenance of a strong US presence in the region.

One way to deal with that is to make our allies and friends strong." ...|$|E
2500|$|The project, as it {{was planned}} in 1962, would have necessitated the {{condemnation}} of about 200 homes and would have cost $35 million. The only express stop between 168th Street and Eastern Parkway would have been Woodhaven Boulevard, which would have needed to be reconstructed to allow for express platforms to be built. The project had serious community opposition, with the district leader of the 13th Assembly District, Arthur A. Gray, saying that the project was [...] "an unnecessary and unwarranted renovation of an antiquated elevated structure in which the transportation <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> community are sacrificed {{for the convenience of}} the many Nassau residents who board the line at its Jamaica terminus." [...] The project was thought as becoming worthless in a few years, as Jamaica was planned to become a big shopping center, and therefore, the el would have had to come down. Suggestions were made to raze the elevated in this section to allow for a shopping mall in Woodhaven. The City Planning Commission continued to oppose the project {{on the grounds of the}} [...] "inadequacies of the project".|$|E
2500|$|Paul's {{views are}} {{generally}} attributed {{to those of}} non-interventionism, which {{is the belief that}} the United States should avoid entangling alliances with other nations, but still retain diplomacy, and avoid all wars not related to direct territorial self-defense. Paul is quoted as stating [...] "America [...] not interfere militarily, financially, or covertly {{in the internal affairs of}} other nations", while advocating [...] "open trade, travel, communication, and diplomacy with other nations". [...] Ronald Reagan spoke in support of Paul's foreign policy views in the early 1980s, stating [...] "Ron Paul is one of the outstanding leaders fighting for a stronger national defense. As a former Air Force officer, he knows well the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> armed forces, and he always puts them first. We need to keep him fighting for our country." [...] Daniel Ellsberg, famous for releasing the Pentagon Papers, has said of Paul in 2010: [...] "On foreign policy, on the Constitution, on Homeland Security, on intervention, he speaks very well." [...] Ohio Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich has said that he and Paul [...] "agree tremendously on international policy".|$|E

2500|$|Only in San Francisco {{could the}} Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence not only make their first appearance, but become {{interwoven}} {{in the cultural}} and political fabric of the city, according to scholar Cathy Glenn in the journal Theory and Event. Glenn uses the examples of San Francisco as a society of hyperpluralism, where all the groups who have called the city their home have successfully maintained their individual identities, creating a culture defined by counterculture and at times marked by political violence. The Sisters use Catholic imagery as simultaneous inspiration and fodder for parody through camp. They choose names based {{on the process of}} renaming women inducted into Catholic orders, but that suggest sexual promiscuity or that are based in absurdity: Sister Anita Blowjob, Sister GladAss of the Joyous Reserectum, Sister Hellena Handbasket, Sister Sensible Shoes, and Sister Homo Celestial, among others. They wear wimples, habits, and robes of nuns, but accessorize them garishly with baubles, beads, and whiteface make-up. Sister Phyllis Stein, the Fragrant Mistress of Sistory, asserts that there is a clear distinction between drag queens and members of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence: [...] "We're not dressed as girls, we're dressed as nuns... We definitely minister to the spiritual <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> community, while drag queens sort of focus on camp and fun within our communities. We're very different communities. A lot of people refer to us as drag queens, but we say we're in nun drag. We are nuns." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{privatisation}} in 1982, British Telecom {{introduced the}} KX100, a more utilitarian design, which began to replace {{most of the}} existing boxes. The KX100 {{was one of a}} series of designs, including the wheelchair-accessible open-sided KX200, and the triangular-footprint KX300. In January 1985, [...] Nick Kane, the Director of Marketing for BT Local Communications Services announced that the old red telephone boxes would be replaced because they [...] "...no longer meet the <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> customers. Few people like to use them. They are expensive and difficult to clean and maintain and cannot be used by handicapped people". This time, BT did not relent, despite another vociferous campaign. Many local authorities used legislation designed to protect buildings of architectural or historic importance to keep old telephone boxes in prominent locations and around 2,000 of them were given listed status. Several thousand others were left on low-revenue mostly rural sites but many thousands of recovered K2 and K6 boxes were sold off. Some kiosks have been converted to be used as shower cubicles in private homes. In Kingston upon Thames a number of old K6 boxes have been used to form a work of art resembling a row of fallen dominoes. It is estimated that 11,000 traditional red telephone boxes remain in public service. The KX+, better known as the KX100 PLUS, introduced in 1996 featured a domed roof reminiscent of the familiar K2 and K6. Subsequent designs have departed significantly from the old style red boxes. BT followed the KX series with the Multi.phone in 1999 and the ST6 in 2007.|$|E
