5|$|Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and {{residential}} buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy {{features such as}} solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near <b>net-zero</b> energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.|$|E

25|$|The Moore House {{achieves}} <b>net-zero</b> energy usage with {{passive solar}} design, ‘tuned’ heat reflective windows, super-insulated and air-tight construction, natural daylighting, solar thermal panels for {{hot water and}} space heating, a photovoltaic (PV) system that generates more carbon-free electricity than the house requires, and an energy-recovery ventilator (ERV) for fresh air. The green building strategies used by Thomas Doerr of Doerr Architecture and Ecofutures Building on the Moore House earned it a verified home energy rating system (HERS) score of −3.|$|E
25|$|Since the museum's founding, over 1,000 {{participatory}} exhibits {{have been}} created, approximately 600 {{of which are}} {{on the floor at}} any given time. The exhibit-building workshop space is contained within the museum and is open to view. In addition to the public exhibition space, the Exploratorium has been engaged in the professional development of teachers, science education reform, and the promotion of museums as informal education centers since its founding. Since Oppenheimer's death in 1985, the Exploratorium has expanded into other domains, including its 50,000-page website and two iPad apps on sound and color. It has also inspired an international network of participatory museums working to engage the public with general science education. The new Exploratorium building is also working to showcase environmental sustainability efforts as part of its goal to become the largest <b>net-zero</b> museum in the country.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 2013, Prime Minister Harper {{announced}} {{funding for}} ecoENERGY Innovation Initiative projects including a project {{being led by}} Owens Corning entitled Integrating Renewables and Conservation Measures in a <b>Net-Zero</b> Energy Low-Rise Residential Subdivision.

The buildABILITY Corporation project management team will be working to assess and resolve challenges in relation to site planning, construction, equipment, grid connections, cost, trade capability, warranty, reliability, sales, marketing, and homebuyer information/education. Five home builders across four provinces will build at least 25 Net Zero Energy (NZE) homes by March 2016 {{as part of this}} project. The five selected builders participating in this initiative are: Mattamy Homes Limited (Calgary, Alberta); Construction Voyer (Laval, Quebec); Minto Communities (Ottawa, Ontario); Provident Development Inc.

2500|$|The goal {{of green}} {{building}} and sustainable architecture {{is to use}} resources more efficiently and reduce a building's {{negative impact on the}} environment. [...] Zero energy buildings achieve one key green-building goal of completely or very significantly reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions {{for the life of the}} building. Zero energy buildings may or may not be considered [...] "green" [...] in all areas, such as reducing waste, using recycled building materials, etc. [...] However, zero energy, or <b>net-zero</b> buildings do tend to have a much lower ecological impact over the life of the building compared with other [...] "green" [...] buildings that require imported energy and/or fossil fuel to be habitable and meet the needs of occupants.|$|E
2500|$|A {{zero-energy}} building, {{also known}} as a zero net energy (ZNE) building, <b>net-zero</b> energy building (NZEB), or net zero building, is a building with zero net energy consumption, meaning the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site, or in other definitions by renewable energy sources elsewhere. These buildings consequently contribute less overall greenhouse gas to the atmosphere than similar non-ZNE buildings. [...] They do at times consume non-renewable energy and produce greenhouse gases, but at other times reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas production elsewhere by the same amount. A similar concept approved and implemented by the European Union and other agreeing countries is nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB), with the goal of having all buildings in the region under nZEB standards by 2020.|$|E
