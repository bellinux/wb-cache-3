2500|$|On September 20, a {{grand jury}} indicted Dedmon on charges of capital murder {{as well as a}} hate crime. Capital murder in Mississippi carries the {{sentences}} of death or life in prison without parole, and the state's hate crime law provides for more severe sentences. Attorneys for both Dedmon and Rice initially denied that the crime was racially motivated. [...] Rice's attorney said the teens were on a [...] "beer run" [...] and that they were <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> black man to assault.|$|E

2500|$|Cohen was {{involved}} with Buddhism beginning in the 1970s and was ordained a Buddhist monk in 1996; he continued to consider himself Jewish: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new religion. I'm quite happy with the old one, with Judaism." [...] Beginning in the late 1970s, Cohen was associated with Buddhist monk and rōshi (venerable teacher) Kyozan Joshu Sasaki, regularly visiting him at Mount Baldy Zen Center and serving him as personal assistant during Cohen's period of reclusion at Mount Baldy monastery in the 1990s. Sasaki appears as a regular motif or addressee in Cohen's poetry, especially in his Book of Longing, and {{took part in a}} 1997 documentary about Cohen's monastery years, Leonard Cohen: Spring 1996. Cohen's 2001 album Ten New Songs is dedicated to Joshu Sasaki.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{some of the}} Sioux Sibley had chased west {{across the}} Missouri River had {{returned}} to the east of the river to replenish their winter supplies of buffalo meat. [...] Sully searched for the Indians toward the southeast [...] On September 3, Sully found numerous remains of recently killed buffalo near a lake and that afternoon his scout, Frank LaFramboise, a mixed-blood Santee, reported a village of 400 lodges 10 miles ahead. LaFramboise was captured briefly by a party of Sioux warriors, but released, a sign perhaps that the Sioux were <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> battle. [...] Sully ordered his advance force, a battalion of the Sixth Iowa, numbering 300 men, under Major A. E. House to surround the encampment and to prevent the Indians from leaving. He left four companies to guard his supply train and then advanced with his main force at a gallop covering the 10 miles in one hour.|$|E

50|$|Having Malkovich's name {{attached}} to the company did not initially prove valuable. According to Smith, writers and financers kept turning down Mr. Mudd because they assumed Malkovich would want to star in the film. The company was forced to stop mentioning Malkovich's involvement, and did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> property <b>for</b> Malkovich to act in for three years.|$|R

[...] He paused and resumed with some emotion: [...] "I know the shabbiness of using this opportunity; but it's the last I'll get. I don't want to work on her gratitude, but I see no other plan. I {{would like to be}} generous--but I can't let her go." ...|$|E

Sesame Street producers were <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Indian-American actress before they cast Vidyasagar, but the show's writers plan to use parts of Vidyasagar's background in certain episodes.

5000|$|This {{is similar}} to {{template}} matching, {{except for the fact}} that you are <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> exact match. An example of this would be to look at an animal such as a Tiger and instead of recognizing that it was a Tiger (template matching) knowing that it was a cat (prototype matching) based on the information you know about the characteristics of a cat.|$|R

30|$|The goal of our model-based {{approach}} for managing quality attributes is to quantitatively evaluate and trade-off multiple quality attributes {{to achieve a}} better overall system configuration. We do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single metric but rather <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quantification of individual attributes and for trade-offs among those metrics. The problem is formalized as the optimization of an objective function that aggregates the metrics and quantifies stakeholders’ preferences for individual attributes.|$|R
25|$|The term {{preimplantation}} {{genetic screening}} (PGS) {{is used to}} denote procedures that do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> specific disease but use PGD techniques to identify embryos at risk. The PGD allows studying the DNA of eggs or embryos to select those that carry certain mutations for genetic diseases. It is useful when there are previous chromosomal or genetic disorders {{in the family and}} within the context of in vitro fertilization programs.|$|R

25|$|Patrick Seale {{argued that}} {{the reason why the}} Syrians were stopped was the superiority of the IAF, which was free to devote all of its {{attention}} to the Syrian front. Kenneth Pollack wrote that the Syrian forces did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> alternative axis of advance and rolled forward without defending their flanks. Martin Van Creveld suggested the explanation that on October 8, when Israel felt that the battle was being lost, it threatened Syria with a nuclear strike.|$|R

The latter group may be regarded as discouraged workers and amounts to 26 percent of all inactive women. The empirical model presented in section 3 intends to control for this heterogeneity in unobserved preferences for work by including random effects.|$|R

50|$|For {{researchers}} who are <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> accurate sampling, they can simply collect their information {{and move on}} to other aspects of their study. This type of sampling can be done by simply creating a questionnaire and distributing it to their targeted group. Through this method, researchers can easily finish collecting their data in a matter of hours, free from worrying about whether it is an accurate representation of the population. This allows <b>for</b> <b>a</b> great ease of research, letting researchers focus on analyzing the data rather than interviewing and carefully selecting participants.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Bi-cooperative {{games have}} been {{introduced}} by Bilbao et al as a generalization of TU cooperative games, where each player can participate positively to the game, negatively, or do not participate. In this paper, we propose a definition of {{a share of the}} wealth obtained by some players after they decided on their participation to the game. It turns out that the cost allocation rule does <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> given player to her contribution at the opposite action to the one she chooses. The relevance of the value is discussed on several examples...|$|R
