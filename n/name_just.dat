5|$|Other {{factors that}} broaden the main {{sequence}} band on the HR diagram include {{uncertainty in the}} distance to stars {{and the presence of}} unresolved binary stars that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy main sequence because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity. Variations in chemical composition caused by the initial abundances, the star's evolutionary status, interaction with a close companion, rapid rotation, or a magnetic field can all slightly change a main-sequence star's HR diagram position, to <b>name</b> <b>just</b> a few factors. As an example, there are metal-poor stars (with a very low abundance of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium) that lie just below the main sequence and are known as subdwarfs. These stars are fusing hydrogen in their cores and so they mark the lower edge of main sequence fuzziness caused by variance in chemical composition.|$|E

25|$|Neural {{factors that}} limit acuity {{are located in}} the retina or the brain (or the pathway leading there). Examples for the first are a {{detached}} retina and macular degeneration, to <b>name</b> <b>just</b> two. Another common impairment, amblyopia, is caused by the visual brain not having developed properly in early childhood. In some cases, low visual acuity is caused by brain damage, such as from traumatic brain injury or stroke. When optical factors are corrected for, acuity can be considered a measure of neural well-functioning.|$|E
25|$|Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary (first ed. 1741–2) A {{collection}} of pieces written and published over many years, though most were collected together in 1753–4.

The Essays show some influence from Addison's Tatler and The Spectator, which Hume read avidly in his youth.|$|E

25|$|Amerindians {{constitute}} around 45% of {{the total}} population. The two major indigenous or ethnic groups are the Quechuas (belonging to various cultural subgroups), followed by the Aymaras, mostly found in the extreme southern Andes. A {{large proportion of the}} indigenous population who live in the Andean highlands still speak Quechua or Aymara, and have vibrant cultural traditions, some of which were part of the Inca Empire. Dozens of indigenous cultures are also dispersed throughout the country beyond the Andes Mountains in the Amazon basin. This region is rapidly becoming urbanized. Important urban centers include Iquitos, Nauta, Puerto Maldonado, Pucallpa and Yurimaguas. This region is home to numerous indigenous peoples, though they do not constitute a large proportion {{of the total}} population. Examples of indigenous peoples residing in eastern Peru include the Shipibo, Urarina, Cocama, and Aguaruna, to <b>name</b> <b>just</b> a few.|$|E
