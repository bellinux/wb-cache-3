50|$|Most of the {{activity}} in Canada is found in research. In 2001, the Canadian government established the National Institute for Nanotechnology in Edmonton. The Institute conducts nano-research {{in a number of}} fields including the life sciences, supramolecular assembly, molecular scale devices and nano-sensors. As of 2010, a number of Canadian universities offer engineering degrees in nanotechnology. Of particular note is the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology which will be in operation in 2011 and will conduct research related to nano-engineered materials, nano-electronics design and fabrication, <b>nano-instrumentation</b> and nano-biosystems.|$|E
50|$|Small scale {{physics is}} also {{the focus of the}} National Institute for Nanotechnology (NINT) at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, Alberta. Operated by the NRC, the {{institute}} was created in 2001 and moved into a state-of-the-art facility among the largest and quietest of its type in the world in 2006. It will study a wide range of nanoscale phenomena, including the synthesis of nanocrystals, nanowires and supramolecular-based nanomaterials, the fabrication of molecular-scale devices, the development of nano-scaled materials for chemical reactions at semiconductor surfaces, protein design, genetic engineering and nanoelectromechanical systems. Of particular recent note is the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology, which will be in operation in 2011 conducting research related to nano-engineered materials, nano-electronics design and fabrication, <b>nano-instrumentation</b> and nano-biosystems. An example of one of the nanofabrication projects associated with the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology is the University of Waterloo Nano Robotics Group. The group, composed only of undergraduate students, is developing a research paper characterizing the surface tension around micro robots at a micro scale after winning first place at the 2011 Mobile Microrobotics Challenge. It was the only team composed completely of undergraduates (as well as the only Canadian team) competing.|$|E
40|$|Nano-fabrication and <b>nano-instrumentation</b> are {{recently}} popular research {{topics in}} the development of nanotechnology. Research demands come from the needs of advanced IC fabrication technology. The state-of-the-art photolithography-based IC technology, with product feature size in the range of sub-micron level, is reaching its extreme limit for a more compact microchip fabrication. Nanotechnology is the chance for the realization of that purpose. STM and AFM are two key equipments currently used {{in the development}} of nano- technology. Tremendous amount of research works announced so far were focusing on the applications of STM and AFM on nano-fabrication and <b>nano-instrumentation.</b> Due to the fact that SPM plays a major role {{in the development of}} nano-technology, both STM and AFM were investigated in very details on their functions and working principles. Typical examples in the development of SPM-fabricated nano-structures were choused to summarize the techniques of nano-technology. The knowledge base involved was then analyzed. Based on that knowledge foundation, a comprehensive curriculum in nano-technology was possible. This research also demonstrated a feasible way in the curriculum development of nano-technology...|$|E
