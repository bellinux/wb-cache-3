40|$|Abstract — The {{intrinsic}} atomistic {{variability of}} <b>nano-scale</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (IC) technology {{must be taken}} into account when analyzing circuit designs to predict likely yield. Monte Carlo (MC) based statistical techniques aim to do this by analysing many randomized copies of the circuit. A major problem is the computational cost of carrying out sufficient analyses to produce statistically reliable results. The MC analyses required for asynchronous circuits are more difficult than are generally required for clocked circuits because of the more complex timing patterns created by handshaking mechanisms. It is important to reduce the computational complexity of MC analysis required for asynchronous circuits. The use of ‘Statistical Behavioural Circuit Blocks (SBCB) ’ is investigated as a means of reducing the dimensionality of the analysis, and this is combined with an implementation of ‘Statistical Blockade ’ to achieve significant reduction in the computational costs. The reduction in computation time achieved by the more efficient MC analysis is illustrated by statistically analysing several simple handshaking circuits.

40|$|The Tunnel Field Effect Transistor (TFET) with sub- 60 mV/decade Sub-threshold {{slope and}} {{extremely}} high ION/IOFF ratio has attracted enough attention for low standby power (LSTP) applications where the battery life is very important. So far {{research in this}} area has been limited to numerical simulation and experimental analysis. It is however extremely necessary to develop compact models for TFET in order to use them in <b>nano-scale</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> design and simulation. In this work, for the first time, we develop analytical Sub-threshold slope model for n-channel double gate TFET (nDGTFET). Unlike conventional FETs, current in TFET is mainly controlled by the band-to-band tunneling mechanism at source/channel interface. As the total drain current is proportional to band-to-band generation rate, the main challenge in the present work is to find an explicit relationship between average electric field over the tunneling path and the applied gate voltage under nonlocal tunneling condition. Two dimensional Poisson’s equation (with Laplace approximation) is first solved in a rectangular coordinate system in order to obtain analytical expression for electron energy distribution over the channel region. Kane’s Model[J. Phy. Chem. Solids 12 (181) 1959]for band-to-band tunneling along with some analytical approximation techniques are then used to derive the expression for the Sub-threshold slope under nonlocal tunneling conditions. This Sub-threshold slope model is verified against professional numerical device simulator (MEDICI) for different device geometries. Being an asymmetric device, TFET fabrication suffers from source misalignment with gate. As the doping in source and drain-gate are different, conventional-FET-like self-aligned gate stack formation is not possible for TFET. Such misalignment, at source side, seriously degrades the performance of TFETs. To overcome this problem, in this work we explore the possibility of using “gate replacement” technique for TFET fabrication. We first develop process flow for single gate bulk nTFET, and then we extend it to n-channel double gate TFET (nDGTFET) using modified FinFET process. Good alignments between source and gate are observed with TCAD-simulations in both the cases...|$|E

40|$|Undoped body multi gate (MG) Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFET) are {{appearing}} as replacements for single gate bulk MOSFET in forthcoming sub- 45 nm technology nodes. It is therefore extremely necessary to develop compact models for MG transistors {{in order to}} use them in <b>nano-scale</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> design and simulation. There is however a sharp distinction between the electrostatics of traditional bulk transistors and undoped body devices. In bulk transistor, where the substrate is sufficiently doped, the inversion charges are located close to the surface and hence the surface potential solely controls the electrostatic integrity of the device. However, in undoped body devices, gate electric field penetrates the body center, and inversion charge exists throughout the body. In contrast to the bulk transistors, depending on device geometry, the potential of the body center of undoped body devices could be higher than the surface in weak inversion regime and the current flows through the center-part of the device instead of surface. Several crucial parameters (e. g. Sub-threshold slope) sometimes become more dependable on the potential of body center rather than the surface. Hence the body-center potential should also be modeled correctly along with the surface-potential for accurate calculation of inversion charge, threshold voltage and other related parameters of undoped body multi-gate transistors. Although several potential models for MG transistors have been proposed to capture the short channel behavior in the subthreshold regime but most of them are based on the crucial approximation of coverting the 2 D Poisson’s equation into Laplace equation. This approximation holds good only at surface but breaks down at body center and in the moderate inversion regime. As a result all the previous models fail to capture the potential of body center Correctly and remain valid only in weak-inversion regime. In this work we have developed semiclassical compact models for potential distribution for double gate (DG) and cylindrical Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistors. The models are based on the analytical solution of 2 D Poisson’s equation in the channel region and valid for both: a) weak and strong inversion regimes, b) long channel and short channel transistors, and, c) body surface and center. Using the proposed model, for the first time, it is demonstrated that the body potential versus gate voltage characteristics for the devices having equal channel lengths but different body thicknesses pass through a single common point (termed as crossover point). Using the concept of “crossover point” the effect of body thickness on the threshold voltage of undoped body multi-gate transistors is explained. Based on the proposed body potential model, a new compact model for the subthreshold swing is formulated. Some other parameters e. g. inversion charge, threshold voltage roll-off etc are also studied to demonstrate the impact of body center potential on the electrostatics of multi gate transistor. All the models are validated against professional numerical device simulator...|$|E
40|$|The use of CMOS-based {{transistors}} {{to implement}} digital logic is the prevalent means of modern computation. It is, however, {{not the only}} means. Advances in nano-science and engineering demonstrate that <b>nano-scale</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> are in fact a viable technology for computation. The dominant means for information propagation in these devices is quantum tunneling - a phenomenon that is not wholly compatible with current design techniques. This paper is an explanation of one process used to both design and simulate digital logic circuits utilizing the topology of the hypercube. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the ease of designing and implementing a streamlined design environment and {{to demonstrate the utility}} that such an environment affords the designer.

30|$|Plasmonic {{cavities}} {{are particularly}} attractive for nano-scale photonic applications as their physical sizes can be {{smaller than the}} diffraction limit of light [1 – 9], whereas the dimensions of conventional dielectric cavities such as photonic crystals [10 – 12], microdisks [13 – 15], nanowires [16 – 18] and metal-cladding cavities [19 – 22] are limited by wavelength. The resonant wavelengths of the surface-plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) excited at the dielectric-metal interface can be shorter than the wavelengths in dielectric cavities. Therefore, SPPs can be confined in a subwavelength volume. Various high-quality (Q) plasmonic cavities were successfully demonstrated by reducing metallic absorption [8], and provided strong optical feedback for lasing {{as well as an}} accessible collection of light emission [3, 4]. Lasing using plasmonic cavities could be a significant step toward an ultimate miniaturized coherent light source for <b>nano-scale</b> photonic <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> In this review paper, we will introduce four recently reported high-Q plasmonic cavities for strong SPP confinement and theoretically investigate their optical properties using three-dimensional (3 D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods.|$|R

40|$|Fabrication process {{variations}} are a {{major source}} of yield degradation in the <b>nano-scale</b> design of <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> (IC), microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and photonic circuits. Stochastic spectral methods are a promising technique to quantify the uncertainties caused by process variations. Despite their superior efficiency over Monte Carlo for many design cases, these algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality; i. e., their computational cost grows very fast as the number of random parameters increases. In order to solve this challenging problem, this paper presents a high-dimensional uncertainty quantification algorithm from a big-data perspective. Specifically, we show that the huge number of (e. g., 1. 5 × 10 ^ 27) simulation samples in standard stochastic collocation can be reduced to a very small one (e. g., 500) by exploiting some hidden structures of a high-dimensional data array. This idea is formulated as a tensor recovery problem with sparse and low-rank constraints; and it is solved with an alternating minimization approach. Numerical results show that our approach can simulate efficiently some ICs, as well as MEMS and photonic problems with over 50 independent random parameters, whereas the traditional algorithm can only handle several random parameters.

Such uncertainties have led to remarkable performance variations at both circuit and system levels, and they cannot be ignored any more in the design of <b>nano-scale</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). In order to simulate the resulting stochastic behaviors, Monte Carlo techniques have been employed in SPICE-like simulators for decades, and they still remain the mainstream techniques in this community. Despite of their ease of implementation, Monte Carlo simulators are often too time-consuming due to the huge number of repeated simulations. This thesis reports the development of several stochastic spectral methods to accelerate the uncertainty quantification of <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> and MEMS. Stochastic spectral methods have emerged as a promising alternative to Monte Carlo in many engineering applications, but their performance may degrade significantly as the parameter dimensionality increases. In this work, we develop several efficient stochastic simulation algorithms for various <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> and MEMS designs, including problems with both low-dimensional and high-dimensional random parameters, as well as complex systems with hierarchical design structures. The first part of this thesis reports a novel stochastic-testing circuit/MEMS simulator as well as its advanced simulation engine for radio-frequency (RF) circuits. The proposed stochastic testing can be regarded as a hybrid variant of stochastic Galerkin and stochastic collocation: it is an intrusive simulator with decoupled computation and adaptive time stepping inside the solver. As a result, our simulator gains remarkable speedup over standard stochastic spectral methods and Monte Carlo in the DC, transient and AC simulation of various analog, digital and RF <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> An advanced uncertainty quantification algorithm for the periodic steady states (or limit cycles) of analog/RF circuits is further developed by combining stochastic testing and shooting Newton. Our simulator is verified by various <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits,</b> showing 10 ² x to 10 ³ x speedup over Monte Carlo when a similar level of accuracy is required. The second part of this thesis presents two approaches for hierarchical uncertainty quantification. In hierarchical uncertainty quantification, we propose to employ stochastic spectral methods at different design hierarchies to simulate efficiently complex systems. The key idea is to ignore the multiple random parameters inside each subsystem and to treat each subsystem as a single random parameter. The main difficulty is to recompute the basis functions and quadrature rules that are required for the high-level uncertainty quantification, since the density function of an obtained low-level surrogate model is generally unknown. In order to address this issue, the first proposed algorithm computes new basis functions and quadrature points in the low-level (and typically high-dimensional) parameter space. This approach is very accurate; however it may suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In order to handle high-dimensional problems, a sparse stochastic testing simulator based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) is developed to accelerate the low-level simulation. At the high-level, a fast algorithm based on tensor decompositions is proposed to compute the basis functions and Gauss quadrature points. Our algorithm is verified by some MEMS/IC co-design examples with both low-dimensional and high-dimensional (up to 184) random parameters, showing about 102 x speedup over the state-of-the-art techniques. The second proposed hierarchical uncertainty quantification technique instead constructs a density function for each subsystem by some monotonic interpolation schemes. This approach is capable of handling general low-level possibly non-smooth surrogate models, and it allows computing new basis functions and quadrature points in an analytical way. The computational techniques developed in this thesis are based on stochastic differential algebraic equations, but the results can also be applied to many other engineering problems (e. g., silicon photonics, heat transfer problems, fluid dynamics, electromagnetics and power systems). There exist lots of research opportunities in this direction. Important open problems include how to solve high-dimensional problems (by both deterministic and randomized algorithms), how to deal with discontinuous response surfaces, how to handle correlated non-Gaussian random variables, how to couple noise and random parameters in uncertainty quantification, how to deal with correlated and time-dependent subsystems in hierarchical uncertainty quantification, and so forth. by Zheng Zhang.
