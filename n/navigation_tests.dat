40|$|OBJECTIVES: An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} presented evidence that various patient groups with acquired brain injury suffer from navigation problems in daily life. This skill is, however, scarcely addressed in current clinical neuropsychological practice and suitable diagnostic instruments are lacking. Real-world <b>navigation</b> <b>tests</b> are limited by geographical location and associated with practical constraints. It was, therefore, investigated whether virtual navigation might serve as a useful alternative. METHODS: To investigate the convergent validity of virtual navigation testing, performance on the Virtual Tübingen test was compared to that on an analogous real-world navigation test in 68 chronic stroke patients. The same eight subtasks, addressing route and survey knowledge aspects, were assessed in both tests. In addition, navigation performance of stroke patients was compared to that of 44 healthy controls. RESULTS: A correlation analysis showed moderate overlap (r=. 535) between composite scores of overall real-world and virtual navigation performance in stroke patients. Route knowledge composite scores correlated somewhat stronger (r=. 523) than survey knowledge composite scores (r=. 442). When comparing group performances, patients obtained lower scores than controls on seven subtasks. Whereas the real-world test was found to be easier than its virtual counterpart, no significant interaction-effects were found between group and environment. CONCLUSIONS: Given moderate overlap of the total scores between the two <b>navigation</b> <b>tests,</b> we conclude that virtual testing of navigation ability is a valid alternative to <b>navigation</b> <b>tests</b> that rely on real-world route exposure.

To investigate the status of remote spatial memory in old age, we tested healthy young and older adults on a variety of mental <b>navigation</b> <b>tests</b> based on a large-scale city environment that was very familiar to participants but rarely visited by the older adults in recent years. We show that whereas performance on a route learning test of new spatial learning was significantly worse in older than younger adults, performance was comparable or better in the older adults on mental <b>navigation</b> <b>tests</b> based on a well-known environment learned long ago. An exception was in the older adults’ ability to vividly re-experience the well-known environment, and recognize and represent the visual details contained within it.

40|$|The {{calibration}} of micro inertial {{measurement units}} {{is important in}} ensuring the precision of navigation systems, which are equipped with microelectromechanical system sensors that suffer from various errors. However, traditional calibration methods cannot meet the demand for fast field calibration. This paper presents a fast field calibration method based on the Powell algorithm. As the key points of this calibration, the norm of the accelerometer measurement vector {{is equal to the}} gravity magnitude, and the norm of the gyro measurement vector is equal to the rotational velocity inputs. To resolve the error parameters by judging the convergence of the nonlinear equations, the Powell algorithm is applied by establishing a mathematical error model of the novel calibration. All parameters can then be obtained in this manner. A comparison of the proposed method with the traditional calibration method through <b>navigation</b> <b>tests</b> shows the classic performance of the proposed calibration method. The proposed calibration method also saves more time compared with the traditional calibration method...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the memory}} {{impairment}} is {{a hallmark of}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD), AD has also been characterized by spatial disorientation, which is present from its early stages. Spatial disorientation in AD manifests itself in getting lost in familiar and unfamiliar places and have been characterized more specifically using spatial <b>navigation</b> <b>tests</b> in both real space and virtual environments as an impairment in multiple spatial abilities, including allocentric and egocentric navigation strategies, visuospatial perception or selection of relevant information for successful navigation. Patients suffering mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who are at {{a high risk of}} development of dementia, show impairment in a subset of these abilities, mainly connected with allocentric and egocentric processing. While spatial disorientation in typical AD patients probably reflects neurodegenerative changes in medial and posterior temporal, parietal and frontal lobes and retrosplenial cortex, the impairment of spatial navigation in MCI seem to be connected mainly with the medial temporal and also parietal brain changes. In this review we will summarize the signs of brain disease in most MCI and AD patients showing in various tasks of spatial memory and navigation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Flow {{fields and}} {{navigation}} conditions induced by hydro-plant releases into lower lock approaches are investigated for hydro plants in typical riverine lock-and-dam installations {{and a wide}} range of flow conditions. Both steady-state and transient tests are carried out. The effects of currents and surges on tows are determined by operating a scaled barge tow. Acquisition of flow field and navi-gation test data for a large combination of geometries and flow conditions is fea-sible using an image-processing system. The size and upstream velocity along the lower guide lock wall of an eddy generated during steady state, and the heights of the surges developed during powerhouse start-ups and shutdowns are the most critical flow parameters for evaluation of navigation impacts. Relationships are obtained for the prediction of these critical parameters in terms of geometric and flow variables. Based on the <b>navigation</b> <b>tests,</b> criteria for acceptable navigation conditions were developed. Amelioration of adverse navigation effects is achieved by installing flow-training structures; a relationship is presented for the preliminary design of these structures...|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} {{approach to}} obstacle detection and avoidance for autonomous land vehicle (ALV) navigation in outdoor road environments using computer vision and image sequence techniques is proposed. To judge whether an object newly {{appearing in the}} image of the current cycle taken by the ALV is an obstacle, the object shape boundary is first extracted from the image. After the translation from the ALV location in the current cycle to that in the next cycle is estimated, the position of the object shape {{in the image of}} the next cycle is predicted, using coordinate transformation techniques based on the assumption that the height of the object is zero. The predicted object shape is then matched with the extracted shape of the object {{in the image of the}} next cycle to decide whether the object is an obstacle. We use a reasonable distance measure to compute the correlation measure between two shapes for shape matching. Finally, a safe navigation point is determined, and a turn angle is computed to guide the ALV toward the navigation point for obstacle avoidance. Successful <b>navigation</b> <b>tests</b> show that the proposed approach is effective for obstacle detection and avoidance in outdoor road environments. ...|$|E

According {{to the different}} positioning accuracy requirements, urban areas are divided into strong constraint (SC) areas, such as roads with lanes, and loose constraint (LC) areas, such as intersections and open areas. As direction of the self-driving vehicle is provided by traffic lanes and global waypoints in the road network, a simple topological map is fit for the navigation in the SC areas. While in the LC areas, the navigation of the self-driving vehicle mainly relies on the positioning information. Simultaneous localization and mapping technology is used to provide a detailed metric map in the LC areas, and a window constraint Markov localization algorithm is introduced to achieve accurate position using laser scanner. Furthermore, the real-time performance of the Markov algorithm is enhanced by using a constraint window to restrict {{the size of the}} state space.

We used a computer-based battery of spatial <b>navigation</b> <b>tests</b> to measure the SN performance in 22 MCI patients as well as 21 normal controls (NC). In order to evaluate intrinsic activity in the subcortical regions that {{may play a role in}} SN, we measured ALFF, fALFF, and ReHo derived within 14 subcortical regions. We observed reductions of intrinsic activity in MCI patients. We also demonstrated that the MCI versus NC group difference can modulate activity-behavior relationship, that is, the correlation slopes between ReHo and allocentric SN task total errors were significantly different between NC and MCI groups in the right hippocampus (interaction F= 4. 44, p= 0. 05), pallidum (F= 8. 97, p= 0. 005), and thalamus (F= 5. 95, p= 0. 02), which were negative in NC (right hippocampus, r=− 0. 49; right pallidum, r=− 0. 50; right thalamus, r=− 0. 45; all p 0. 2).

30|$|It is {{difficult}} to compare {{the results of the}} <b>Navigation</b> <b>tests</b> with the Foot-LITE tests. For one thing, the HMIs are different as is the response expected from the driver with the Foot-LITE HMI being associated with a simple driver response (speed up, slow down etc.) whereas navigation requires more cognitive processing to interpret the information provided in order to make an appropriate response. Other devices with a diversity of HMI’s may provide wider ranging and perhaps different results. Furthermore, the market is evolving quickly and even moved on during the life of the project. There is now more widespread use of smart-phone applications to provide functions, an example of a change in HMI. Hence although {{the results of this study}} are useful on the assumption that they could be more widely extrapolated to the general traffic context, there is a need to keep evaluating how the changing HMI’s affect driver distraction. However, comparing this with other research which has investigated the effects of using an IVIS on glance behaviours, shows that time recorded with Foot-LITE was considerably less in comparison. Other studies of mean glance durations to PNDs have been shown to be between 1.06 and 1.45  s [14] and approximately 1  s [15] whilst glances to in car entertainment were found to be 0.88  s [16] and between 0.8 and 1.1  s [14].|$|E
