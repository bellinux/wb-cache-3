5|$|In a dark match {{before the}} {{pay-per-view}} broadcast, Adam Bomb pinned Kwang. As the broadcast opened, the commentators, Vince McMahon (fresh off his federal trial acquittal, one month earlier) and Jerry Lawler, announced that The Headshrinkers had dropped the tag team title to Diesel and Shawn Michaels, {{and that the}} belts would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the line at SummerSlam. Throughout the broadcast, Nielsen and his co-star from The Naked Gun, George Kennedy, appeared backstage in skits {{trying to solve the}} mystery of the two Undertakers.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power can actually be a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E

25|$|Amid this {{instability}} in ownership, WLWI found the going rather difficult. It was also dogged by a weaker network affiliation; ABC would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> {{an equal footing}} with CBS and NBC in the ratings until the 1970s. WLWI spent most of its first 17 years of operation languishing as a third place also-ran behind NBC affiliate WFBM-TV (channel 6, now ABC affiliate WRTV) and then-CBS affiliate WISH-TV (channel 8, now a CW affiliate). In some cases, it even fell to fourth place in the local ratings behind then-independent station WTTV.|$|E

25|$|Loosening load-in rules: The load-in period {{may last}} several weeks and cost $1 million or more. Current work rules require {{producers}} to determine ahead of time how many stagehands are needed on each given day. These numbers cannot change once load-in begins, requiring producers to pay salaries even if no work occurs. The rule ensures that workers will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> call (and unpaid for it) during the load-in period. The producers proposed essentially eliminating the rule. The union agreed to loosen the rule, but sought to keep a minimum number of stagehands at work each day.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the guards}} {{were able to}} get into the cells, they {{stripped}} the inmates naked, tore apart the beds and the cell, and put the prisoners who had started the rebellion in solitary confinement. As all nine guards could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> duty at once, they began rewarding the prisoners for good behavior. The prisoners who had not been involved in starting the riot were allowed to lie in their beds, wash themselves and brush their teeth and eat while those who had started the riot were not allowed to. The guards continued to use tormenting tactics to divide the prisoners and forestall further organized resistance. In the case of one prisoner, who was a smoker, the guards were able to control his behavior because they decided when and if he was allowed to smoke.|$|E
25|$|The Sims Bustin' Out is {{the second}} title in The Sims console series. Bustin' Out was {{released}} for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and N-Gage {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2003. As the title suggests, Sims can get out of the house to visit other locations such as Shiny Things Lab or Casa Caliente. There are two modes. Bust Out Mode which has mission based gameplay and Freeplay Mode which is open-ended gameplay very much like the original The Sims PC game. It was the second Sims game to <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the PC; it was a follow up to The Sims, which was very similar to Bustin' Out, except the aims were shifted to getting job promotions and constantly fulfilling goals to get ahead in the game. The PlayStation 2 version also features the option to play online, though EA no longer supports it.|$|E

25|$|On August 6, 2010, the CBC {{issued a}} press release stating that due to {{financial}} reasons, the CBC and Radio-Canada would only transition 27 transmitters total, one in each market where there was an originating station (i.e. a CBC or Radio-Canada television station located in that market). Further, the CBC stated in the release, that only 15 of the transmitters would be in place by August 31, 2011 {{due to lack of}} available funds, and that the remainder would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the air until as late as August 31, 2012. Additionally, the CBC stated in the release that it was asking the CRTC for permission to continue broadcasting in analogue until the identified transmitters for transition were up and running. At the time of the press release, only eight of the corporation's transmitters (four CBC and four Radio Canada) were broadcasting in digital.|$|E
25|$|On July 16, 2008, the California Supreme Court {{denied a}} {{petition}} {{calling for the}} removal of Proposition 8 from the November ballot. The petition asserted the proposition should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the ballot on the grounds it was a constitutional revision that only the Legislature or a constitutional convention could place before voters. Opponents also argued that the petitions circulated to qualify the measure for the ballot inaccurately summarized its effect. The court denied the petition without comment. As a general rule, it is improper for courts to adjudicate pre-election challenges to a measure's substantive validity. The question of whether Proposition 8 is a constitutional amendment or constitutional revision was ruled on by the California Supreme Court on May 26, 2009, and found {{that it was not a}} revision and therefore would be upheld. They also declared that the same-sex marriages performed prior to the passing of Prop 8 would remain valid.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, Eric Gomez, {{president}} of Golden Boy Promotions told the LA Times that Álvarez had an immediate rematch clause {{in place on}} his contract, whereas Golovkin, if he loses, won't be guaranteed a rematch. De La Hoya later also revealed {{in an interview with}} ESPN the fight would take place at the full middleweight limit of 160 pounds with no re-hydration clauses, meaning Golovkin and Álvarez would be able to gain unlimited amount of weight following the weigh in. On June 5, the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue of the fight, and would mark the first time Golovkin would fight in the state of Nevada. The AT Stadium, Madison Square Garden and Dodgers Stadium missed out on hosting the fight. Eric Gomez of Golden Boy Promotions {{said in a statement that}} Álvarez would fight for the IBF meaning he would participate in the second day weight in, which the IBF require that each boxer weighs no more than 10 pounds over the 160 pound limit. Although he said there was no word on whether Álvarez would fight for the WBC title, Álvarez claimed that he would <b>not</b> <b>be.</b> <b>On</b> July 7, 2017 Golden Boy and K2 Promotions individually announced the tickets had sold out.|$|E
