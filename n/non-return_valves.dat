5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E
25|$|Another {{alternative}} is the Fluidyne engine (Fluidyne heat pump), which uses hydraulic pistons {{to implement the}} Stirling cycle. The work produced by a Fluidyne engine goes into pumping the liquid. In its simplest form, the engine contains a working gas, a liquid, and two <b>non-return</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pasley's diving salvage {{operation}} set many diving milestones, {{including the}} first recorded use of the buddy system in diving, when he gave instructions to his divers to operate in pairs. In addition, the first emergency swimming ascent was made by a diver after his air line became tangled {{and he had to}} cut it free. A less fortunate milestone was the first medical account of a diving barotrauma. The early diving helmets had no <b>non-return</b> <b>valves,</b> so if a hose was severed near the surface, the ambient pressure air around the diver's head rapidly drained from the helmet to the lower pressure at the break, leaving a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the helmet that could cause injurious and sometimes life-threatening effects. At the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in 1842, Sir John Richardson described the diving apparatus and treatment of diver Roderick Cameron following an injury that occurred on 14 October 1841 during the salvage operations.|$|E
50|$|A {{pneumatic}} <b>non-return</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|Inhalation {{closes the}} {{mouthpiece}} exhalation <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> and draws gas through the inhalation <b>non-return</b> <b>valve.</b> The pressure drop draws {{the contents of}} the outer bellows through the scrubber, inhalation hose, <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> and mouthpiece to the diver. As the concentric bellows contract, the pressure in the inner bellows increases and first closes the internal <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> then pushes its contents through the outer <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> discharging to the surroundings.When the bellows is fully contracted, the bottom cover triggers the gas addition valves which inject gas until the diver stops inhaling and the bottom cover no longer presses against the addition valve actuator.If the gas in the breathing circuit has been compressed by an increase in depth, the gas volume will be even less and the addition valves will be triggered for longer, bringing the volume back to the appropriate level. The RB80 uses two addition valves in parallel, so that if one fails, the other will provide the required gas.|$|R
50|$|The loop {{configuration}} uses a one directional {{circulation of}} the breathing gas which on exhalation leaves the mouthpiece, {{passes through a}} <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> into the exhalation hose, and then through the counterlung and scrubber, {{to return to the}} mouthpiece through the inhalation hose and another <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> when the diver inhales.|$|R
500|$|Insulated glazing (or [...] "double glazing") {{was used}} in the {{construction}} of public baths. Elite housing in cooler climates might have hypocausts, a form of central heating. The Romans were the first culture to assemble all essential components of the much later steam engine, when Hero built the aeolipile. With the crank and connecting rod system, all elements for constructing a steam engine (invented in 1712)—Hero's aeolipile (generating steam power), the cylinder and piston (in metal force pumps), <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> (in water pumps), gearing (in water mills and clocks)—were known in Roman times.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{injection}} pipe is usually protected with <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> to prevent release on a power outage, {{there is still}} a risk that the pipe itself could tear and leak due to the pressure. The Berkel en Rodenrijs incident in December 2008 was an example, where a modest release of [...] from a pipeline under a bridge resulted in the deaths of some ducks sheltering there. In order to measure accidental carbon releases more accurately and decrease the risk of fatalities through this type of leakage, the implementation of [...] alert meters around the project perimeter has been proposed. Malfunction of a carbon dioxide industrial fire suppression system in a large warehouse released [...] and 14 citizens collapsed on the nearby public road. A release of [...] from a salt mine killed a person at distance of 300 meters.|$|E
50|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} to lock sites using pneumatic <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> during the loading or transferring of chemicals or hazardous waste. Pneumatic <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> {{have a longer}} service life when compared to pneumatic bladder systems.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel. The technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> was re-designed so {{it could not be}} installed incorrectly.|$|R
5000|$|A check <b>valve,</b> clack <b>valve,</b> <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> reflux valve, or one-way valve is a valve that {{normally}} allows fluid (liquid or gas) to flow through it {{in only one}} direction.|$|R

50|$|Pneumatic <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> are {{installed}} below ground {{and can be}} used to pneumatically lock the non-return valve closed thus containing a site {{in the event of a}} spill.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{technical}} developments during this period appear to be down to Alec Plint, who is named as applicant on 5 Stuart Turner patents which include sealing crankcases, padding crankcases to improve compression, variable speed gears, and decompression devices. The 1911 patent diagrams show the current 2-stroke to be '2-port', i.e. with the inlet being by <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> into the transfer port, with ball races for the main bearings and deflector type piston. The inlet <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> {{is the subject of}} another Stuart Turner patent in 1911, naming Ernest Masters as co-applicant.|$|R

2500|$|Sutton Wick air crash, {{in which}} a wrongly-fitted <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> caused fuel {{starvation}} on an RAF Blackburn Beverley transport aircraft in 1957, leading it to crash and burst into flames near Abingdon-on-Thames ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Non-return</b> <b>valves</b> were fitted which, {{under certain}} conditions, caused {{both ends of}} the {{high-pressure}} cylinder to be in communication, with the result that the piston would be floating and the low-pressure cylinders would be receiving high-pressure steam, thus converting the engine to simplex working.|$|E
50|$|Pneumatic <b>{{non-return}}</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used}} where a normal non-return valve would be ineffective. This is for example {{where there is}} a risk of flood water entering a site but an equal risk of pollution or a chemical spills leaving a site and polluting the environment.|$|E

50|$|The exhaled {{gas expands}} the counterlungs, {{and some of}} it flows into the inner bellows. On inhalation, the diver only {{breathes}} from the outer counterlung - return flow from the inner bellows is blocked by a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve.</b> The inner bellows also connects to another <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> opening to the outside environment, and thus the gas from the inner bellows is dumped from the circuit in a fixed proportion of the volume of the inhaled breath. If the counterlung volume is reduced sufficiently for the rigid cover to activate the feed gas demand valve, gas will be added until the diver finishes that inhalation.|$|R
25|$|A {{main supply}} <b>valve</b> with <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> which {{supplies}} gas {{to the main}} gas supply hose of the umbilical. This is usually a quarter-turn valve, as it must be quick to operate and obvious whether it is open or closed.|$|R
50|$|Valve {{positions}} are operating conditions {{determined by the}} position of the disc or rotor in the valve. Some valves are made to be operated in a gradual change between two or more positions. Return valves and <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> allow fluid to move in 2 or 1 directions respectively.|$|E

50|$|Managing {{fire water}} {{frequently}} {{requires that the}} water be contained on site and then removed from site for specialised treatment.

500|$|In {{response}} to the disaster at Sutton Wick, the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> was redesigned to make such an error impossible. Aviation author Graham Perry wrote that, after the crash, [...] "airworthiness design standards were changed so that the threads {{at either end of}} all such valves manufactured since are now made totally different from each other.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{reorientation}} of interfaces is key to efficient distributive mixing. However, how to achieve reorientation is not well known. This paper describes how interfaces can be reoriented in screw extruders and which method leads to the most effective reorientation. A new mixing device was developed to achieve highly efficient reorientation. This mixer can produce excellent mixing quality over a short axial length, as short as one diameter. This makes it possible to incorporate this new mixer into the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> of an injection molding screw. Results will be presented from injection molding studies that compare the mixing action of the new mixing <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> to other mixing devices...|$|R

50|$|The {{design is}} an {{enhanced}} Mid-Deck Tanker {{and consists of}} a series of centre and wing tanks that are divided by horizontal bulkheads. The upper wing tanks form ballast tanks and act as emergency receiver tanks for cargo should the lower tanks be fractured.

50|$|Drains of {{all sizes}} can be fitted with systems {{available}} with extension brackets that cater for drain depths from 500 mm to over 2.5m deep.There are also pneumatically controllable flap valves or pneumatically controlled <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> which can be fitted to existing soil waste systems.

2500|$|The {{mechanism}} of the twin hose regulator is packaged in a usually circular metal housing mounted on the cylinder valve behind the diver's neck. The demand valve component of a two-stage twin hose regulator is thus mounted in the same housing as the first stage regulator, {{and in order to}} prevent free-flow, the exhaust valve must be located at the same depth as the diaphragm, and the only reliable place to do this is in the same housing. The air flows through a pair of corrugated rubber hoses to and from the mouthpiece. The supply hose is connected {{to one side of the}} regulator body and supplies air to the mouthpiece through a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> and the exhaled air is returned to the regulator housing on the outside of the diaphragm, also through a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> on the other side of the mouthpiece and usually through another <b>non-return</b> exhaust <b>valve</b> in the regulator housing - often a [...] "duckbill" [...] type.|$|R
50|$|The breathing/buoyancy bag is {{fitted with}} a <b>non-return</b> release <b>valve</b> which allows air {{to escape from the}} bag as the user ascends towards the surface and the water {{pressure}} decreases. The wearer can close this valve on reaching the surface, the air in the breathing/buoyancy bag then serving as a life preserver. If the bag becomes deflated while the wearer is on the surface awaiting rescue, it can be refilled (for use as a lifejacket) by opening the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> and blowing through the mouthpiece.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} method of {{supplying}} {{air to the}} bag is through blowing into a blowpipe, or blowstick.
