50|$|Phantom {{stock and}} SAR {{accounting}} is straightforward. These plans are {{treated in the}} same way as deferred cash compensation. As the amount of the liability changes each year, an entry is made for the amount accrued. A decline in value would create a <b>negative</b> <b>entry.</b> These entries are not contingent on vesting. In closely held companies, share value is often stated as book value. However, this can dramatically underrate the true value of a company, especially one based primarily on intellectual capital. Having an outside appraisal performed, therefore, can make the plans much more accurate rewards for employee contributions. It is expected that hedge fund and private equity fund managers will begin to more frequently use SARs in order to circumvent IRS code 457A while maintaining proper alignment of long term incentives for employee and investors.|$|E

50|$|Bank-issued credit {{makes up}} the largest {{proportion}} of credit in existence. The traditional view of banks as intermediaries between savers and borrower is incorrect. Modern banking is about credit creation. Credit {{is made up of}} two parts, the credit (money) and its corresponding debt, which requires repayment with interest. The majority (97% as of December 2013) of the money in the UK economy is created as credit. When a bank issues credit (i.e. makes a loan), it writes a <b>negative</b> <b>entry</b> into the liabilities column of its balance sheet, and an equivalent positive figure on the assets column; the asset being the loan repayment income stream (plus interest) from a credit-worthy individual. When the debt is fully repaid, the credit and debt are cancelled, and the money disappears from the economy. Meanwhile, the debtor receives a positive cash balance (which is used to purchase something like a house), but also an equivalent negative liability to be repaid to the bank over the duration. Most of the credit created goes into the purchase of land and property, creating inflation in those markets, which is a major driver of the economic cycle.|$|E
30|$|A similar problem {{addressed}} in [32] is the symmetric non-negative inverse eigenvalue problem (SNIEP), that is, finding a symmetric matrix with non-negative entries and specific spectrum. The numerical method for {{the solution of}} SNIEP presented in [32] utilizes alternating projection ideas, proposing an algorithm in which, first, the eigenvalue decomposition is used to impose the desired spectrum, and, then, every <b>negative</b> <b>entry</b> of the obtained matrix is set to zero to obtain a non-negative matrix. The numerical method we propose here {{for the construction of}} a signature matrix is inspired by the work of [32].|$|E

For the SEDLM the bias remains negligible for a larger range. However near {{to the edges of}} the envelope attenuation occurs. This effect can be mitigated by using a larger envelope at the cost of increased computational burden and a small variance penalty as is visible in the right panel.|$|E
40|$|Normally, when {{updating}} or regionalizing input-output matrices with <b>negative</b> <b>entries,</b> the <b>negative</b> {{numbers are}} first brought outside the matrix, then the matrix is updated or regionalized, then the negative numbers are added {{back to the}} result. This is theoretically, and sometimes also empirically, a rather unsatisfactory procedure. This paper proposes a theoretically sound alternative for the presently used ad hoc procedure. Based on the first-order conditions of a restated information loss problem, we generalize the RAS-procedure using reciprocals of the exponential transformations of the related Lagrange multipliers. The diagonal matrices that update or regionalize a given matrix optimally are the solutions of a fixed-point problem.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} idea in Junius and Oosterhaven (2003) {{is to break}} down the information contained in the a priori data into two parts: algebraic signs, and absolute values. This approach is well grounded in information theory, and provides a basis on which {{to solve the problem of}} adjusting matrices with <b>negative</b> <b>entries.</b> However, Junius and Oosterhaven (2003) have formulated a target function that is not equivalent to the Kullback and Leibler (1951) cross-entropy measure, and so is not a representation of the minimum information loss principle. Neither is the alternative target function proposed by Lenzen et al. (2007). This paper develops the exact Kullback and Leibler cross-entropy measure. In addition, following the constrained optimization approach, this paper applies the same principle to solve adjustment problems where row-sums, column-sums or both are constrained to zero.

In the experiments presented in this paper, we choose t= 1 / 2, but fine tuning is possible depending on the frame dimensions. Thus, the second step of the algorithm does not actually project on A, but on a broader set; equivalently, the steps towards A are smaller compared to Algorithm 1.|$|E

This article examined the role of qualitative education-job matching in explaining these poor labor market outcomes. Upon arrival, immigrants, especially females, {{are more likely than}} natives to be mismatched. Further, when immigrants are mismatched, they generally experience larger wage penalties compared to natives suggesting they have a greater difficulty adapting when not able to work in their field. As such, mismatches are an important mechanism behind the <b>negative</b> <b>entry</b> effects experienced by Canadian immigrants reported throughout the literature. On the whole, mismatches can explain in the range of 9 to 14 % of the entry wage disadvantage experience by immigrants upon arrival. Among immigrants from non-traditional source regions, only those who are closely matched upon arrival can expect to reach parity with comparably skilled natives over their working career in Canada.|$|E
