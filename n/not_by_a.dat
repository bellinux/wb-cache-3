5|$|By {{the late}} Stuart period, the Treasury was often run <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single {{individual}} {{such as a}} Lord High Treasurer but by a committee of Lords of the Treasury, led by the First Lord of the Treasury. The last Lords High Treasurer, Lord Godolphin (1702–1710) and Lord Oxford (1711–1714), ran the government of Queen Anne.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, five Chan {{films were}} {{produced}} in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In these films, Chan owns his detective agency and is aided, <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> son, {{but by a}} daughter, Manna, played first by Gu Meijun (顾梅君) in the Shanghai productions and then by Bai Yan (白燕) in postwar Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{equations}} {{of general relativity}} are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which {{is determined by the}} Einstein equations themselves, <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.|$|E

5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best police of The Wire are motivated <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Swiss {{physician}} René Flammer {{discovered an}} antigen within the mushroom that stimulates an autoimmune reaction causing the body's immune cells to consider its own {{red blood cells}} as foreign and attack them. Despite this, {{it was not until}} 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating P.involutus, and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998. The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of Paxillus mushrooms. Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom {{for a long period of}} time, sometimes for many years, and has shown mild gastrointestinal symptoms on previous occasions. The Paxillus syndrome is better classed as a hypersensitivity reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is caused <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom. The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the blood serum. In the course of subsequent meals, antigen-antibody complexes are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their breakdown.|$|E

5|$|The Mari Lwyd itself {{consists}} of a horse's skull that is decorated with ribbons and affixed to a pole; {{to the back of}} the skull is attached a white sheet, which drapes down to conceal both the pole and the individual carrying this device. On occasion, the horse's head was represented <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> skull but was instead made from wood or even paper. In some instances, the horse's jaw was able to open and close as a result of string or lever attached to it, and there are accounts of pieces of glass being affixed into the eye sockets of some examples, representing eyes. An observer of the tradition as it was performed at Llangynwyd during the nineteenth century noted that preparation for the activity was a communal event, with many locals involving themselves in the decorating of the Mari Lwyd.|$|E

25|$|Scelba's {{fall was}} {{accomplished}} by his own party, due to political manoeuvring of party rivals like ex-Premier Giuseppe Pella (who wanted to be Premier again) and Party Secretary Amintore Fanfani (who also liked to be Premier).

25|$|The {{stratification}} {{in a lake}} is {{not always}} the result of variation to density because of thermal gradients. Stratification within a lake can also be the result of differences in density resulting from gradients in salinity. In case of a difference in salinity, the hypolimnion and epilimnion are separated <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> thermocline but by a halocline, which is sometimes referred to as a chemocline.|$|E

25|$|Those moai {{that are}} less eroded {{typically}} have designs carved on their backs and posteriors. The Routledge expedition of 1914 established a cultural link between these designs and the island's traditional tattooing, which had been repressed by missionaries a half-century earlier. Until modern DNA analysis of the islanders and their ancestors, this was key scientific evidence that the moai had been carved by the Rapa Nui and <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> separate group from South America.|$|E
25|$|However, while {{a smooth}} {{manifold}} {{is not a}} PL manifold, it carries a canonical PL structure – it is uniquely triangularizable; conversely, not every PL manifold is smoothable. For a particular smooth manifold or smooth map between smooth manifolds, this can be shown by breaking up the manifold into small enough pieces, and then linearizing the manifold or map on each piece: for example, a circle in the plane can be approximated by a triangle, but <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 2-gon, since this latter cannot be linearly embedded.|$|E

25|$|In the US {{and in most}} of {{the western}} world, skydivers are {{required}} to carry two parachutes. The reserve parachute must be periodically inspected and re-packed (whether used or <b>not)</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> certified parachute rigger (in the US, an FAA certificated parachute rigger). Many skydivers use an automatic activation device (AAD) that opens the reserve parachute at a pre-determined altitude if it detects that the skydiver is still in free fall. Depending on the country, AADs are often mandatory for new jumpers, and/or required for all jumpers regardless of their experience level. Most skydivers wear a visual altimeter, and an increasing number also use audible altimeters fitted to their helmets.|$|E
25|$|The {{most serious}} {{military}} threat to Santa Barbara during the Spanish period was <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> colonial power, but by Hippolyte de Bouchard, a French privateer {{working for the}} Argentine government, which was, along with Mexico, attempting to throw off Spanish rule. Bouchard, who was given the task of destroying as many Spanish assets as possible, {{and in particular the}} ports in the Americas, possessed two well-armed frigates, which had sufficient armament and crews to destroy any lightly defended towns they encountered. He had done exactly that to Monterey, the capital of Alta California, shortly before coming to Santa Barbara.|$|E
25|$|Esarhaddon (681–669 BC) succeeded Sennacherib as {{ruler of}} the Assyrian Empire. He {{completely}} rebuilt Babylon and brought peace to the region. He conquered Egypt, Nubia and Libya and entrenched his mastery over the Persians, Medes, Parthians, Scythians, Cimmerians, Arameans, Israelites, Phoenicians, Canaanites, Urartians, Pontic Greeks, Cilicians, Phrygians, Lydians, Manneans and Arabs. For the next 60 or so years Babylon and Chaldea remained peacefully under direct Assyrian control. The Chaldeans remained subjugated and quiet during this period, and the next major revolt in Babylon against the Assyrian empire was fermented <b>not</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Chaldean, Babylonian or Elamite, but by Shamash-shum-ukin, who was an Assyrian king of Babylon, and elder brother of Ashurbanipal (668-627 BC), the new {{ruler of the}} Neo-Assyrian Empire.|$|E
