Protesters sought no permits, although it is required by Bahraini law.

5|$|Wilhelm was one {{of eleven}} {{children}} born to poor tenant farmers John and Ethel (née Stanley) Wilhelm in Huntersville, North Carolina. He played baseball at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina. There, he began experimenting with a knuckleball after reading about pitcher Dutch Leonard. He felt that, because he could <b>not</b> <b>throw</b> fast, honing a knuckleball offered him his best shot at success. He used a tennis ball to practice.|$|E

5|$|After {{suffering}} {{an injury}} and being {{knocked out of}} Michigan's game with Nebraska (a 23–9 loss to the Cornhuskers) on October 27, Robinson returned to the lineup for the last home game of the 2012 season, a 42-17 victory over Iowa. Playing in his final game at Michigan Stadium, Robinson split his playing time between the tailback, quarterback, and wide receiver positions. He accounted for 122 yards, including 98 rushing yards on 13 carries and 24 receiving yards on two receptions. With the injury to the ulnar nerve in his right elbow, Robinson did <b>not</b> <b>throw</b> the ball during the game {{and was forced to}} carry the ball in his right hand.|$|E
5|$|During November 1908, Maeda went to Paris, France, {{apparently}} {{to see his}} friend Akitaro Ono. From Paris, he went to Havana, arriving there on December 14, 1908, and his twice-a-day wrestling act quickly proved to be very popular. On July 23, 1909, Maeda left Havana for Mexico City. His debut in Mexico City {{took place at the}} Virginia Fabregas Theater on July 14, 1909. This show was a private demonstration for some military cadets. Shortly afterwards, Maeda began appearing at the Principal Theater. His standing offer was 100 pesos (US $50) to anyone he could <b>not</b> <b>throw,</b> and 500 pesos (US $250) to anyone who could throw him. The Mexican Herald did not record anyone taking his money.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a career}} high in {{appearances}} in 2004, Rivera did <b>not</b> <b>throw</b> during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began {{on a low}} note. After missing time in spring training with elbow bursitis, he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston {{dating back to the}} previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation {{with a sense of humor}} by tipping his cap to the crowd.|$|E

5|$|Hennessey threw five pitches: a fastball, a slider, a changeup, a curveball, and a cutter. The fastball was Hennessey's main pitch; {{he threw}} it over 60% {{of the time}} in the majors. He did <b>not</b> <b>throw</b> it very hard, {{averaging}} speeds under 90mph in 2007 and 2008. His slider was his secondary pitch, and his changeup was his third most-used pitch. Hennessey rarely used the cutter except for in 2006, when he threw it 10.1% of the time. Henessey often was plagued by a big inning, displaying a tendency to allow several runs in an inning during his starts.|$|E
5|$|The road opener was {{the first}} game ever played in the new home stadium of the UCF Knights. McCoy's 47 passing {{attempts}} tied a Texas single-game record. His 32 completions set a new school record, besting the 30 completed by Vince Young during the 2006 Rose Bowl and by Major Applewhite during two 1999 games. The final non-conference game was against Rice, and McCoy completed 20 of his 29 passing attempts, accumulating 333 yards through the air. For {{the first time in}} the season, he did <b>not</b> <b>throw</b> an interception. McCoy and most of the Longhorn starting players were replaced by backups after the first drive of the second half. True freshman quarterback John Chiles made his first college appearance in the first quarter. He came onto the field beside McCoy and then McCoy trotted out to a slot receiver position. Chiles never looked to pass; he ran up the middle for no gain. He came out of the game after that play and came back in the third quarter as McCoy's replacement. On that drive, Chiles line up in the zone-read offense and led the Longhorns 80 yards to a touchdown, carrying the ball four times for 49 yards. Chiles' strong performance immediately led to media speculation as to how much playing time he will take from McCoy.|$|E

He had surgery following the controversial decision over Castillo, and said his shoulder had fully healed.|$|E
25|$|Southerton was {{involved}} in an unusual incident during the Surrey County Cricket Club v Marylebone Cricket Club match at the Kennington Oval in 1870. Southerton cut a ball hard to W.G.

Nobody except Southerton thought he was out, but he walked away, and when recalled, refused to come back.|$|E
25|$|An battled another {{rival in}} Oleinic in the semi-final, {{and this time}} could <b>not</b> <b>throw</b> for ippon. He threw Oleinic with a drop morote seoi nage for yuko, and the no other throws were scored, sending him to the final. In the final he met rising star Tomorkhuleg for an {{anticipated}} match up, with the absence of Ebinuma. However, Tomorkhuleg had withdrawn due to injury, effectively giving the win to An via fusen gachi.|$|E

25|$|Spurrier had few {{opportunities}} {{to play and}} fewer to start early in his pro career, {{and he did not}} play very well when he got on the field. He attempted less than five passes over the entire season in three out of his first five years in the NFL, and he did <b>not</b> <b>throw</b> a touchdown pass until his third pro season. Instead, he settled into the role of backup quarterback and starting punter.|$|E
25|$|Isildur {{immediately}} {{took the}} hilt-shard of Elendil's sword, which had broken {{in the struggle}} against Sauron, and cut the One Ring from the hand of Sauron's mortal form. Despite the urging of Elrond and Círdan, Gil-galad's lieutenants, Isildur did <b>not</b> <b>throw</b> the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom. Isildur made a scroll with a description of the Ring and a copy of its fading inscription. This scroll was archived in Minas Anor and discovered by Gandalf nearly an Age later.|$|E
25|$|The 20,000 {{evacuees}} {{started to}} return in batches from July, with 2,000 deportees returning in August. The children, {{many of whom were}} very young when they had left five years earlier, hardly knew their relatives and many could no longer speak the local Patois language. Men and women who had volunteered for the armed services returned when demobbed, mainly in 1946. Relationships would have been difficult at first.

25|$|Although being {{projected}} a {{first round}} selection for the 2012 NFL Draft by midseason of 2011, Barkley {{then decided to}} return to USC for his senior season. As early as April 2012, he was projected the No. 1 overall pick for the 2013 NFL Draft. However, one month prior to the draft, Barkley's draft stock had fallen with ESPN draft analysts Mel Kiper Jr. and Todd McShay projecting Barkley to fall out of the first round. Due to his shoulder injury, Barkley did <b>not</b> <b>throw</b> in the Indianapolis NFL Scouting Combine and instead took medical tests on his shoulder.|$|E
25|$|Journalists {{that covered}} the Mets claimed that Landrith was {{incapable}} of throwing out runners that attempted to steal bases off him. The Orioles ignored the claim, insisting that they sought after him because he could indeed throw well. Based on the New York scouting report, American League teams aggressively tried to steal bases against the Orioles when Landrith joined the team. In his first week, 11 runners tried to steal a base off Landrith. He threw out six runners, immediately removing the stigma that he could <b>not</b> <b>throw.</b> The blame for the high stolen base count against the Mets was promptly shifted away from Landrith and onto the New York Mets pitching.|$|E
25|$|New England had {{narrowly}} {{defeated the}} Dolphins 14-12 {{in a tough}} defensive struggle during the last Monday night game of the regular season, and this playoff game would have similar results. The Patriots' defense held Miami to 162 total yards of offense, 42 rushing yards and forced three Dolphins turnovers. Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino completed only 17 of 43 passes for 141 yards and was intercepted twice. He also fumbled the ball twice, losing a turnover on one of them. This {{was the first time}} in Marino's 15-year career (including 14 postseason games) that he did <b>not</b> <b>throw</b> a touchdown pass in a playoff game. Without star running back Curtis Martin, New England could only generate 228 offensive yards, but their ball security turned out to be key as they avoided losing any turnovers for the entire game.|$|E
