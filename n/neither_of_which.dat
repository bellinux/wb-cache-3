5|$|On Twomile Run {{above the}} acid mine drainage, {{a total of}} 19 macroinvertebrate taxa {{including}} 5 members of the orders Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera were observed in 1998.

5|$|After Operation Maiglöckchen, the {{division}} shifted to a largely defensive posture aimed at denying the Partisans {{access to the}} security zone. Since its arrival in the zone {{the division}} had been assisted in this task by local forces of varying reliability. These included four groups of Chetniks numbering 13,000, Nešad Topčić's Zeleni kadar (or Green Cadres, a Muslim nationalist militia) most of which eventually joined the Partisans, and both Ustaše militia and the Croatian Home Guard, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was effective.

5|$|Casualties in {{the battle}} are {{notoriously}} hard to calculate exactly. With only one exception (Scipion), records made by the French captains of their losses at the time are incomplete. The only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of Saint-André and the records made by British officers aboard the captured ships, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> can be treated as completely reliable. Most sources accept that French casualties in the campaign numbered approximately 7,000, including around 3,000captured, but these figures are vague and frequently {{do not agree with}} each other on details. British casualties are easier to confirm but here, too, there are some discrepancies; overall British casualties are generally given as around 1,200.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{accumulation}} of c-fos mRNA in mouse thymocytes was compared when {{the cells were}} stimulated by concanavalin A (Con A), the Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187 or the phorbol ester, TPA, either separately or by combinations of these mitogens. The c-fos response to mitogenic concentrations of Con A could not be attributed either to the rise in [Ca 2 +]i it induces or to activation of protein kinase C. Thus, although Con A causes the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate in these cells, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> the signals <b>which</b> can be generated by this response {{was responsible for the}} activation of the c-fos gene by Con A.

40|$|Several {{homologous}} hamster embryonic cell lines, {{transformed in}} association with simian virus (SV) 40 infection, were examined {{for the presence of}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) complementary to SV 40 ribonucleic acid (RNA) made in vitro.

Those lines which contained both the SV 40 surface (S) and tumor (T) antigens also contained DNA complementary to SV 40 RNA synthesized in vitro. In contrast, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> two lines <b>which</b> contained S, but not T, antigen contained detectable DNA complementary to SV 40 RNA.

40|$|Treatment of Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal {{subunits}} with trypsin sequentially {{removes a}} number of different ribosomal proteins, as revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins that are removed early by trypsin correlate well with those that are added last during reconstitutive assembly of the 30 S subunit from 16 S ribosomal RNA and the total protein complement. Proteins that are resistant to removal from the subunit by the highest trypsin concentration used correlate with those that are added early during assembly. Six proteins can be removed from the subunit with trypsin without affecting its ability to bind the antibiotic streptomycin. A decline in the ability of the 30 S subunit to bind streptomycin is correlated with the removal of either one, or both, <b>of</b> two proteins, <b>neither</b> one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> is the gene product of the streptomycin locus.

5000|$|Critic David Laird also {{tends to}} agree with Ardolino's point of view. According to him the dilemma that Hieronimo finds himself in opens [...] "an abrupt and {{dramatically}} effective contrast between the Christian ideal of patience and humility and the classical-pagan concept of honor". [...] After the initial discovering of Horatio's murderers, Hieronimo, as the knight marshal, first turns to the King and the instituted system of justice for help. However, [...] "when that preferred and sanctioned way is blocked for him by the calculating efforts of his enemies, Hieronimo is {{forced to choose between}} alternatives <b>neither</b> one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> is wholly acceptable to him". [...] Those two alternatives being to actively seek his own private justice or for him to retreat and to allow the Christian concept of [...] "divine promise of eventual justice" [...] to run its course.

5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure {{to consider all}} elements of pattern design tends to result in poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> could be saved by quantizing (digitizing) the pattern geometry.

40|$|During {{the last}} thirty years, {{the period of the}} Frontiers in Education conferences, there has been a {{research}} movement that has studied school effectiveness and thus the factors that lead to school improvement.

40|$|Extremal Optimization (EO), a new local search heuristic, {{is used to}} {{approximate}} ground states of the mean-field spin glass model introduced by Sherrington and Kirkpatrick. The implementation extends the applicability of EO to systems with highly connected variables. Approximate ground states of sufficient accuracy and with statistical significance are obtained for systems with more than N= 1000 variables using ±J bonds. The data reproduces the well-known Parisi solution for the average ground state energy of the model to about 0. 01 %, providing {{a high degree of}} confidence in the heuristic. The results support to less than 1 % accuracy rational values of ω= 2 / 3 for the finite-size correction exponent, and of ρ= 3 / 4 for the fluctuation exponent of the ground state energies, <b>neither</b> one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> has been obtained analytically yet.
