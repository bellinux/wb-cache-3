5|$|Burnet made {{significant}} contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the <b>neuraminidase</b> that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the <b>neuraminidase</b> substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are often}} {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This ensures that the inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower Ki) than substrate-based designs. An {{example of such a}} transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug oseltamivir; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring oxonium ion in the reaction of the viral enzyme <b>neuraminidase.</b>|$|E
5|$|Enzymes serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus <b>neuraminidase.</b>|$|E
40|$|Theoretical investigations, using semi-empirical {{potential}} functions {{have been}} carried out to predict the favoured conformations of the terminal dissaccharide fragments of various sialyloligosaccharides. The proposed conformational similarity for these fragments has been correlated to the binding specificity of <b>neuraminidases.</b> These calculations predict that bacterial <b>neuraminidases</b> have a binding site which can accommodate only two sugar residues and virus <b>neuraminidases</b> have a binding site which can accommodate more than two sugar residues...|$|R
40|$|Antigenic {{relationships}} between <b>neuraminidases</b> of influenza B viruses isolated from 1940 to 1968 were studied by neuraminidase-inhibition tests using hyperimmune rabbit antisera. The cross-reactions between the enzymes of influenza B viruses showed that some antigenic drift had occurred {{but that they}} are all related. From these results it is concluded that the differences between the <b>neuraminidases</b> of influenza B viruses are not sufficiently clear-cut to allow the viruses to be separated into subgroups...|$|R

5|$|Frequent {{hand washing}} {{reduces the risk}} of viral spread. Wearing a {{surgical}} mask is also useful. Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the <b>neuraminidase</b> inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza. Their benefits in those who are otherwise healthy {{do not appear to be}} greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.|$|E
5|$|Since {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} effective in treating influenza if given early (see treatment section, below), it can be important to identify cases early. Of the symptoms listed above, the combinations of fever with cough, sore throat and/or nasal congestion can improve diagnostic accuracy. Two decision analysis studies suggest that during local outbreaks of influenza, the prevalence will be over 70%, and thus patients {{with any of these}} combinations of symptoms may be treated with <b>neuraminidase</b> inhibitors without testing. Even {{in the absence of a}} local outbreak, treatment may be justified in the elderly during the influenza season as long as the prevalence is over 15%.|$|E
25|$|Different {{influenza}} viruses encode {{for different}} hemagglutinin and <b>neuraminidase</b> proteins. For example, the H5N1 virus designates an influenza A subtype {{that has a}} type 5 hemagglutinin (H) protein and a type 1 <b>neuraminidase</b> (N) protein. There are 18 known types of hemagglutinin and 11 known types of <b>neuraminidase,</b> so, in theory, 198 different combinations of these proteins are possible.|$|E
50|$|NCR (natural {{cytotoxicity}} receptors), {{a type of}} type 1 transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily, upon stimulation, mediate NK {{killing and}} release of IFNγ. They bind viral ligands such as hemagglutinins and hemagglutinin <b>neuraminidases,</b> some bacterial ligands and cellular ligands related with tumour growth such as PCNA.|$|R
50|$|<b>Neuraminidases,</b> {{also called}} sialidases, {{catalyze}} the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acid residues from {{the newly formed}} virions and from the host cell receptors. Sialidase activities include assistance in the mobility of virus particles through the respiratory tract mucus and in the elution of virion progeny from the infected cell.|$|R
30|$|<b>Neuraminidases</b> (NEU), {{also known}} as sialidases, cleave sialic acid {{residues}} from glycol-conjugates and are associated with cancer progression (Miyagi, et al., 2012). Four mammalian NEU homologues are known so far—NEU 1, NEU 2, NEU 3 and NEU 4 —of which NEU 1, 2 and 4 are downregulated in various cancers, resulting in sialoglycan accumulation in cancer cells. In contrast, NEU 3 is significantly up-regulated in many human cancers (Kakugawa, et al., 2002; Nomura, et al., 2006; Hata, et al., 2015). Raval et al. found that sialyltransferase activity, and the levels of sialic acids and sialylated glycoproteins were upregulated in breast cancer and oral carcinoma cells, and decreased upon anticancer treatment (Raval, et al., 2003). Taken together, sialylated glyco-antigens are promising potential cancer biomarkers, considering sialyltransferases and <b>neuraminidases</b> are associated with cancers, therefore more {{studies are needed to}} be validated for pre-operative diagnosis.|$|R

25|$|Negative-sense vRNAs {{that form}} the genomes of future viruses, RNA-dependent RNA transcriptase, and other viral {{proteins}} are assembled into a virion. Hemagglutinin and <b>neuraminidase</b> molecules cluster into a bulge in the cell membrane. The vRNA and viral core proteins leave the nucleus and enter this membrane protrusion (step 6). The mature virus buds off from the cell in a sphere of host phospholipid membrane, acquiring hemagglutinin and <b>neuraminidase</b> with this membrane coat (step 7). As before, the viruses adhere to the cell through hemagglutinin; the mature viruses detach once their <b>neuraminidase</b> has cleaved sialic acid residues from the host cell. After the release of new influenza virus, the host cell dies.|$|E
25|$|The major {{glycoprotein}} (HA) is interposed irregularly by {{clusters of}} <b>neuraminidase</b> (NA), with {{a ratio of}} HA to NA of about 4–5 to 1.|$|E
40|$|The {{electrostatic}} {{component of}} the enzyme/inhibitor interaction {{of a wide range}} influenza <b>neuraminidases</b> and inhibitors has been analyzed using transferable aspherical-atom densities from a recently compiled databank. Results are subdivided into the contributions of individual active-site residues and different functional groups of the inhibitors, and the effect of the Arg 292 →Lys mutation is considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} sialic acid (Sia) {{residues}} from glycoconjugates in vertebrates is mediated {{by a family}} of <b>neuraminidases</b> (sialidases) consisting of Neu 1, Neu 2, Neu 3 and Neu 4 enzymes. The enzymes play distinct physiological roles, but their ability to discriminate between the types of linkages connecting Sia and adjacent residues and between the identity and arrangement of the underlying sugars has never been systematically studied. Here we analyzed the specificity of <b>neuraminidases</b> by studying the kinetics of hydrolysis of BODIPY-labeled substrates containing common mammalian sialylated oligosaccharides: 3 'Sia-LacNAc, 3 'SiaLac, SiaLex, SiaLea, SiaLec, 6 'SiaLac, and 6 'SiaLacNAc. We found significant differences in substrate specificity of the enzymes towards the substrates containing α 2, 6 -linked Sia, which were readily cleaved by Neu 3 and Neu 1 but not by Neu 4 and Neu 2. The presence of a branching 2 -Fuc inhibited Neu 2 and Neu 4, but had almost no effect on Neu 1 or Neu 3. The nature of the sugar residue at the reducing end, either glucose (Glc) or N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) had only a minor effect on all <b>neuraminidases,</b> whereas core structure (1, 3 or 1, 4 bond between D-galactose (Gal) and GlcNAc) {{was found to be}} important for Neu 4 strongly preferring β 3 (core 1) to β 4 (core 2) isomer. Neu 3 and Neu 4 were in general more active than Neu 1 and Neu 2, likely due to their preference for hydrophobic substrates. Neu 2 and Neu 3 were examined by molecular dynamics to identify favorable substrate orientations in the binding sites and interpret the differences in their specificities. Finally, using knockout mouse models, we confirmed that the substrate specificities observed in vitro were recapitulated in enzymes found in mouse brain tissues. Our data for the first time provide evidence for the characteristic substrate preferences of <b>neuraminidases</b> and their ability to discriminate between distinct sialoside targets...|$|R
30|$|The mRNA {{expression}} of genes nanH, pld, sodC, and spaC detected in goat abscesses was expected, since the <b>neuraminidases,</b> phospholipases, superoxide dismutase and adhesins (SodC) are important bacterial virulence factors. The in vivo {{expression of}} CP 40 serine protease was also expected, considering that antibodies from infected animals recognize this antigen under Western blotting (Walker et al. 1994; Wilson et al. 1995).|$|R

25|$|Influenza A viruses {{are further}} classified, {{based on the}} viral surface {{proteins}} hemagglutinin (HA or H) and <b>neuraminidase</b> (NA or N). Sixteen H subtypes (or serotypes) and nine N subtypes of influenza A virus have been identified.|$|E
25|$|If a {{particular}} hemagglutinin or <b>neuraminidase</b> has been circulating outside the human population, then humans will lack immunity to this protein and an influenza pandemic may follow a host switch event, {{as seen in}} 1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009.|$|E
40|$|Rabbit Tamm–Horsfall {{glycoprotein}} and bovine submaxillary glycoprotein {{were both}} found to contain sialic acid residues which are released {{at a slow}} rate by the standard conditions of acid hydrolysis. These residues are also resistant to <b>neuraminidases</b> from Vibrio cholerae and Clostridium perfringens. This behaviour was attributed {{to the presence of}} O-acetylated sialic acid, since the removal of O-acetyl groups by mild alkaline treatment normalized the subsequent release of sialic acid from rabbit Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein by acid and by enzymic hydrolysis. Determination of the O-acetyl residues in rabbit Tamm–Horsfall glycoprotein indicated that on average two hydroxyl groups of sialic acid are O-acetylated, and these were located on the polyhydroxy side-chain of sialic acid or on C- 4 and C- 8. These findings confirm the assumption that certain O-acetylated forms of sialic acid are not substrates for bacterial <b>neuraminidases.</b> Several explanations have been suggested to explain the effect of O-acetylation of the side-chain on the rate of acidcatalysed hydrolysis of sialic acid residues...|$|R
40|$|The sialylated glycosphingolipids gangliosides are {{essential}} to myelination, axon integrity, transmission of nervous impulses and memory consolidation. Ganglioside expression patterns in the brain are cell-specific, dynamic and maintained by highly coordinated processes of biosynthesis, trafficking, processing and catabolism. The changes {{in the composition of}} gangliosides during development and aging cannot be explained based solely on the regulation of the ganglioside-synthesizing enzymes, sialyltransferases, suggesting that <b>neuraminidases</b> play essential role...|$|R

In enzyme-inhibition tests, the <b>neuraminidases</b> of the A 2 / 57 and A 2 / 66 viruses cross-reacted {{with those of}} Turkey/Wisconsin/ 66, Turkey/Massachusetts/ 65 and Duck/Italy/ 574 / 66 viruses. The enzyme of the Hong Kong variant had a wider spectrum of cross-reactions than did those of the A 2 / 57 and A 2 / 66 viruses. No cross-reaction was detected with Turkey/Massachusetts/ 65 but the A 2 /Hong Kong enzyme showed major antigenic similarities with the enzymes of Turkey/Wisconsin/ 66 and Duck/Italy/ 574 / 66 and Duck/Germany/ 1998 / 68 viruses. Minor cross-reactions were also detected between the A 2 /Hong Kong enzyme and those of fowl plague virus, virus ”N”, Duck/England/ 56 and Swine/Cambridge/ 39...|$|R

We examined the pH stability of H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic avian IAV (HPAI) NAs and identified amino acids responsible for conferring stability at low pH. We found that, unlike other avian viruses, most H 5 N 1 IAVs isolated since 2003 had NAs that were unstable at low pH, similar to human epidemic IAVs. These H 5 N 1 viruses are thus already human virus-like and, therefore, have the frequent infections of humans...|$|R
