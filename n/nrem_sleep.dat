5|$|Sleep {{involves}} great {{changes in}} brain activity. Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep, but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: REM sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep,</b> also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.|$|E
25|$|Otherwise {{there is}} wide {{variation}} between days and individuals. Nearly {{fifty percent of}} GH secretion occurs during {{the third and fourth}} <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep</b> stages.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} {{narcolepsy}} also suffer from insomnia {{for extended periods}} of time. The excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy often become severe enough to cause serious problems in a person's social, personal, and professional life. Normally, when an individual is awake, brain waves show a regular rhythm. When a person first falls asleep, the brain waves become slower and less regular, which is called non-rapid eye movement (<b>NREM)</b> <b>sleep.</b> After {{about an hour and}} a half of <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep,</b> the brain waves begin to show a more active pattern again, called REM sleep (rapid eye movement sleep), when most remembered dreaming occurs. Associated with the EEG-observed waves during REM sleep, muscle atonia is present called REM atonia.|$|E
50|$|Histaminergic neurons have a wakefulness-related firing pattern. They fire rapidly during waking, fire {{more slowly}} {{during periods of}} relaxation/tiredness and {{completely}} stop firing during REM and <b>NREM</b> (non-REM) <b>sleep.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objectives. Sleep EEG {{spindles}} {{are linked}} to efficient cortical-subcortical connectivity and intellectual abilities. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the relationship of spindle activity to psychosocial stress response and coping strategies in healthy kindergarten children. Methods. In a cross-sectional study of 41 5 -year old kindergarten children we examined stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system activity by saliva cortisol measurements and sleep regulation by sleep EEG-monitoring. Stress response was measured during the application of a standardized psychological challenge appropriate at this age. <b>NREM</b> S 2 <b>sleep</b> EEG spindles were visually scored and put into relation to coping and HPA activity parameters. Results. An increased total number of <b>NREM</b> S 2 <b>sleep</b> spindles correlated positively with increased high ego-involvement strategies such as "positive emotions". By contrast, total number of <b>NREM</b> S 2 <b>sleep</b> spindles correlated negatively with low ego-involvement strategies such as "denial" and "avoidance". Stress induced HPA-activity correlated positively with coping strategies with high ego-involvement; while there was no correlation with low ego-involvement strategies. Conclusions. Total number of visually detected <b>NREM</b> S 2 <b>sleep</b> spindles is elevated in children with coping involving positive, high ego-involvement; in contrast, low ego-involvement during stress is associated with reduced total number of <b>NREM</b> S 2 <b>sleep</b> spindles...|$|R
5000|$|Local {{sleep is}} a {{neurological}} phenomenon where brain activity in an organism that is otherwise awake enters a state which closely {{resembles that of}} sleep. In an Electroencephalogram, these patterns generally resemble <b>NREM</b> slow-wave <b>sleep,</b> and oscillate between 'on' and 'off' periods {{in the same way}} that would be expected during an actual sleeping state.|$|R
25|$|In the reach-to-grasp task rodents {{learned a}} skilled forelimb task. Sleep {{improved}} movement speed with preservation of accuracy. These offline improvements {{were linked to}} both replay of task-related ensembles during non-rapid eye movement (<b>NREM)</b> <b>sleep</b> and temporal shifts that more tightly bound motor cortical ensembles to movements.|$|E
25|$|There are {{significant}} similarities between sleep in birds {{and sleep in}} mammals, {{which is one of}} the reasons for the idea that sleep in higher animals with its division into REM and <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep</b> has evolved together with warm-bloodedness. Birds compensate for sleep loss in a manner similar to mammals, by deeper or more intense SWS (slow-wave sleep).|$|E
25|$|The {{ontogeny}} {{of sleep}} {{is the study}} of sleep across different age groups of a species, particularly during development and aging. Among mammals, infants sleep the longest. Human babies have 8 hours of REM sleep and 8 hours of <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep</b> on an average. The percentage of time spent on each mode of sleep varies greatly in the first few weeks of development and some studies have correlated this to the degree of precociality of the child. Within a few months of postnatal development, there is a marked reduction in percentage of hours spent in REM sleep. By the time the child becomes an adult, he spends about 6â€“7 hours in <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep</b> and only about an hour in REM sleep. This is true not only of humans, but of many animals dependent on their parents for food. The observation that the percentage of REM sleep is very high in the first stages of development has led to the hypothesis that REM sleep might facilitate early brain development. However, this theory has been contested by other studies.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough {{numerous}} studies have convincingly demonstrated that sleep plays {{a critical role in}} motor sequence learning (MSL) consolidation, the specific contribution of the different sleep stages in this type of memory consolidation is still contentious. To probe the role of stage 2 non-REM <b>sleep</b> (<b>NREM</b> 2) in this process, we used a conditioning protocol in three different groups of participants who either received an odor during initial training on a motor sequence learning task and were re-exposed to this odor during different sleep stages of the post-training night (i. e., <b>NREM</b> 2 <b>sleep</b> [Cond-NREM 2], REM sleep [Cond-REM], or were not conditioned during learning but exposed to the odor during NREM 2 [NoCond]). Results show that the Cond-NREM 2 group had significantly higher gains in performance at retest than both the Cond-REM and NoCond groups. Also, only the Cond-NREM 2 group yielded significant changes in sleep spindle characteristics during cueing. Finally, we found that a change in frequency of sleep spindles during cued-memory reactivation mediated the relationship between the experimental groups and gains in performance the next day. These findings strongly suggest that cued-memory reactivation during <b>NREM</b> 2 <b>sleep</b> triggers an increase in sleep spindle activity that is then related to the consolidation of motor sequence memories...|$|R
40|$|Sleep {{has been}} {{identified}} as a critical brain state enhancing the probability of gaining insight into covert task regularities. Both non-rapid eye movement (<b>NREM)</b> and REM <b>sleep</b> have been implicated with offline re-activation and reorganization of memories supporting explicit knowledge generation. According to two-stage models of sleep function, offline processing of information during sleep is sequential requiring multiple cycles of <b>NREM</b> and REM <b>sleep</b> stages. However, the role of overnight dynamic sleep macrostructure for insightfulness has not been studied so far. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that the frequency of interactions between <b>NREM</b> and REM <b>sleep</b> stages might be critical for awareness after sleep. For that aim, the rate of sleep stage transitions was evaluated in 53 participants who learned implicitly a serial reaction time task (SRTT) in which a determined sequence was inserted. The amount of explicit knowledge about the sequence was established by verbal recall after a night of sleep following SRTT learning. Polysomnography was recorded in this night and in a control night before and was analyzed to compare the rate of sleep-stage transitions between participants who did or did not gain awareness of task regularity after sleep. Indeed, individual ability of explicit knowledge generation was strongly associated with increased rate of transitions between <b>NREM</b> and REM <b>sleep</b> stages and between light sleep stages and slow wave sleep. However, the rate of NREM-REM transitions specifically predicted the amount of explicit knowledge after sleep in a trait-dependent way. These results demonstrate that enhanced lability of sleep goes along with individual ability of knowledge awareness. Observations suggest that facilitated dynamic interactions between sleep stages, particularly between <b>NREM</b> and REM <b>sleep</b> stages play a role for offline processing which promotes rule extraction and awareness...|$|R

This behaviour could be attributed to confusional arousal. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|Recent studies {{examining}} gene expression and evolutionary increases in brain size offer complimentary {{support for the}} role of sleep in the mammalian memory consolidation theory. Evolutionary advances {{in the size of the}} mammalian amygdala, (a brain structure active during sleep and involved in memory processing), are also associated with increases in <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep</b> durations. Likewise, nighttime gene expression differs from daytime expression and specifically targets genes thought to be involved in memory consolidation and brain plasticity.|$|E
25|$|Combining Hobson's {{activation}} synthesis hypothesis with Solms' findings, the continual-activation {{theory of}} dreaming presented by Jie Zhang proposes that dreaming {{is a result}} of brain activation and synthesis; at the same time, dreaming and REM sleep are controlled by different brain mechanisms. Zhang hypothesizes that the function of sleep is to process, encode, and transfer the data from the temporary memory store to the long-term memory store. During <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep</b> the conscious-related memory (declarative memory) is processed, and during REM sleep the unconscious related memory (procedural memory) is processed.|$|E
25|$|Birds {{have both}} REM and <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep,</b> and the EEG {{patterns}} of both have similarities {{to those of}} mammals. Different birds sleep different amounts, but the associations seen in mammals between sleep and variables such as body mass, brain mass, relative brain mass, basal metabolism and other factors (see below) are not found in birds. The only clear explanatory factor for the variations in sleep amounts for birds of different species is that birds who sleep in environments where {{they are exposed to}} predators have less deep sleep than birds sleeping in more protected environments.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} {{medical diagnosis}} is NREM arousal parasomnia - sexual behaviour in sleep. Sexsomnia {{is considered a}} type of non-rapid eye movement <b>sleep</b> (<b>NREM)</b> parasomnia. Sexsomniacs do not remember the acts that they perform while they are asleep.|$|R
5000|$|It {{occurs during}} both REM and <b>NREM</b> stages of <b>sleep</b> though its time is {{slightly}} delayed. During stage 2 NREM it seems {{responsible for the}} production of K-complexes. N100 is reduced following total sleep deprivation and this associates with an impaired ability to consolidate memories ...|$|R
50|$|In {{individuals}} with idiopathic generalized epilepsy, K-complex induced synchronization can trigger spike-and-wave discharges. This tends to happen most between the shift between waking and NREM, and between <b>NREM</b> and REM <b>sleep.</b> In autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, K-complexes are almost invariably {{present at the}} start of seizures.|$|R
25|$|Sleep is a {{naturally}} recurring state characterized by reduced or absent consciousness and proceeds in cycles of {{rapid eye movement}} (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (<b>NREM)</b> <b>sleep.</b> The normal order of sleep stages is N1 â†’ N2 â†’ N3 â†’ N2 â†’ REM. Sleep stages are characterized by spectral content of EEG: for instance, stage N1 refers to the transition of the brain from alpha waves (common in the awake state) to theta waves, whereas stage N3 (deep or slow-wave sleep) {{is characterized by the}} presence of delta waves.|$|E
25|$|Body {{temperature}} {{is not well}} regulated during REM sleep, and thus organisms become more sensitive to temperatures outside their thermoneutral zone. Cats and other small furry mammals will shiver and breathe faster to regulate temperature during NREMS but not during REMS. With the loss of muscle tone, animals lose the ability to regulate temperature through body movement. (However, even cats with pontine lesions preventing muscle atonia during REM did not regulate their temperature by shivering.) Neurons which typically activate in response to cold temperaturesâ€”triggers for neural thermoregulationâ€”simply do not fire during REM sleep, {{as they do in}} <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep</b> and waking.|$|E
25|$|Status epilepticus: Although rare, focal motor {{status or}} hemiconvulsive status epilepticus {{is more likely}} to occur than {{secondarily}} generalised convulsive status epilepticus, which is exceptional. Opercular status epilepticus usually occurs in children with atypical evolution or may be induced by carbamazepine or lamotrigine. This state lasts for hours to months and consists of ongoing unilateral or bilateral contractions of the mouth, tongue or eyelids, positive or negative subtle perioral or other myoclonus, dysarthria, speech arrest, difficulties in swallowing, buccofacial apraxia and hypersalivation. These are often associated with continuous spikes and waves on an EEG during <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
40|$|Sleep is a vital, highly {{organized}} process {{regulated by}} complex systems of neuronal networks and neurotransmitters. Normal sleep comprises non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM periods that alternate through the night. Sleep usually begins in NREM and progresses through deeper NREM stages (2, 3, and 4 stages), but newborns enter REM sleep (active <b>sleep)</b> first before <b>NREM</b> (quiet <b>sleep).</b> A period of <b>NREM</b> and REM <b>sleep</b> cycle is approximately 90 minutes, but newborn have a shorter sleep cycle (50 minutes). As children mature, sleep changes {{as an adult}} pattern: shorter sleep duration, longer sleep cycles and less daytime sleep. REM sleep is approximately 50 % of total sleep in newborn and dramatically decreases over the first 2 years into adulthood (20 % to 25 %). An initial predominant of slow wave sleep (stage 3 and 4) that peaks in early childhood, drops off abruptly after adolescence by 40 % from preteen years, and then declines over the life span.

50|$|The {{evidence}} of the involvement of mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic pathways suggests that dreaming occurs when a motivational component is activated. Only when this pathway is removed do dreams cease to occur. This system can be activated by mechanisms of REM sleep but can also occur independently during <b>NREM</b> stages of <b>sleep.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>NREM</b> stage 1 <b>sleep,</b> {{known as}} a brief {{interval}} of transition from wake to sleep, is characterized by neurophysiological events and subjective sensory experiences that suggest the stage {{may be involved in}} memory processing. To examine this possibility, we conducted multiple awakenings with a trained participant during short bursts of theta activity defining the 5 th sub stage of <b>NREM</b> stage 1 <b>sleep</b> (<b>NREM</b> 1 ?). Awakenings provided frequent reports of vivid dreaming containing coherent scenesâ€”as opposed to isolated objects often associated with general sleep onset imagery. Analyses of the temporal and semantic aspects of the memories associated with this imagery suggest that multiple memories are selected for incorporation in NREM 1 ? imagery {{on the basis of their}} semantic proximity and temporal remoteness. Analyses also demonstrate a remarkable pattern in about a third of dreams in which distinct, semantically related memories dating from as little as 10 minutes to as much as 15 years ago were bound in close temporal and spatial proximity within the novel contexts of the imagery. This offline manipulation of semantic information, observed here at a phenomenological level, bears a resemblance to processes thought to underlie integrative encoding, i. e., the encoding of an association between events that were not experienced together but which are subsequently combined because they contain at least one overlapping element. Â  This preliminary study provides evidence consistent with the notion that hippocampal-mediated memory processing occurs during the theta bursts found at sleep onset...|$|R
25|$|Accumulated {{observation}} {{has shown}} that dreams are strongly associated with REM rapid eye movement sleep, during which an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows brain activity that, among sleep states, is most like wakefulness. Participant-remembered dreams during <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep</b> are normally more mundane in comparison. During a typical lifespan, a person spends {{a total of about}} six years dreaming (which is about two hours each night). Most dreams only last 5 to 20 minutes. It is unknown where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple portions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind.|$|E
25|$|Mammals, {{birds and}} {{reptiles}} evolved from amniotic ancestors, the first vertebrates with life cycles independent of water. The fact that {{birds and mammals}} are the only known animals to exhibit REM and <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep</b> indicates a common trait before divergence. Reptiles are therefore the most logical group to investigate the origins of sleep. Daytime activity in reptiles alternates between basking and short bouts of active behavior, which has significant neurological and physiological similarities to sleep states in mammals. It is proposed that REM sleep evolved from short bouts of motor activity in reptiles while SWS evolved from their basking state which shows similar slow wave EEG patterns.|$|E
25|$|In the R standard, <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep</b> {{was divided}} into four stages, with slow-wave sleep {{comprising}} stages 3 and 4. In stage 3, delta waves made up less than 50% of the total wave patterns, while they made up more than 50% in stage 4. Furthermore, REM sleep was {{sometimes referred to as}} stage 5. In 2004, the AASM commissioned the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force to review the R scoring system. The review resulted in several changes, the most significant being the combination of stages 3 and 4 into Stage N3. The revised scoring was published in 2007 as The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. Arousals, respiratory, cardiac, and movement events were also added.|$|E
2500|$|REM {{sleep is}} [...] "paradoxical" [...] {{because of its}} {{similarities}} to wakefulness. Although the body is paralyzed, the brain acts somewhat awake, with cerebral neurons firing with the same overall intensity as in wakefulness.

All algorithms are designed in Matlab. Feature vectors for individual methods are obtained using energy values, Welch's spectral analysis and Hilbert-Huang Transform. For classification three types of artificial neural networks were used - layer recurrent network, feedforward network and pattern recognition network.

50|$|Brain-damaged {{patients}} offer valuable but rare {{information about}} human brain mechanisms. Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman observed REM sleep {{and concluded that}} it was the physiological manifestation of dreaming. This was assumed to be a breakthrough in the understanding of such an elusive process as dreaming. Indeed, 95% of subjects awakened during REM reported that they had been dreaming whereas only about 5-10% reported dreams after being awakened during nonREM <b>sleep</b> (<b>NREM).</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>NREM</b> <b>sleep</b> is {{characterized}} by decreased global and regional cerebral blood flow. Non-REM sleep which constitutes ~80% of all sleep in humans. Initially, {{it was expected that}} the brainstem, which was implicated in arousal would be inactive, but this was later on found to have been due to low resolution of PET studies and it was shown that there is some slow wave activity in the brainstem as well. However, other parts of the brain, including the precuneus, basal forebrain and basal ganglia are deactivated during sleep. Many areas of the cortex are also inactive, but to different levels. For example, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is considered the least active area while the primary cortex, the least deactivated.|$|E
25|$|REM {{sleep is}} physiologically {{different}} from the other phases of sleep, which are collectively referred to as non-REM sleep (<b>NREM</b> <b>sleep,</b> NREMS, synchronized sleep). REM and non-REM sleep alternate within one sleep cycle, which lasts about 90 minutes in adult humans. As sleep cycles continue, they shift towards a higher proportion of REM sleep. The transition to REM sleep brings marked physical changes, beginning with electrical bursts called PGO waves originating in the brain stem. Organisms in REM sleep suspend central homeostasis, allowing large fluctuations in respiration, thermoregulation, and circulation which do not occur in any other modes of sleeping or waking. The body abruptly loses muscle tone, a state known as REM atonia.|$|E
25|$|In narcolepsy, {{the order}} and length of NREM and REM sleep periods are disturbed, with REM sleep {{occurring}} at sleep onset instead of {{after a period of}} <b>NREM</b> <b>sleep.</b> Also, some aspects of REM sleep that normally occur only during sleep, like lack of muscular control, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreams, occur at other times in people with narcolepsy. For example, the lack of muscular control can occur during wakefulness in a cataplexy episode; it is said that there is intrusion of REM atonia during wakefulness. Sleep paralysis and vivid dreams can occur while falling asleep or waking up. Simply put, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of dozing and deep sleep but goes directly into (and out of) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.|$|E
40|$|Background: Mounting {{evidence}} {{demonstrates that}} individuals with stroke benefit from sleep to enhance learning of a motor task. While stage <b>NREM</b> 2 <b>sleep</b> and REM sleep {{have been associated with}} off-line motor skill learning in neurologically-intact individuals, it remains unknown which sleep parameters or specific sleep stages are associated with off-line motor skill learning in individuals with stroke. Methods: Twenty individuals with chronic stroke (> 6 months following stroke) and 10 neurologically slept for three consecutive nights in a sleep laboratory with polysomnography. Participants practiced a tracking task the morning before the third night and underwent a retention test the morning following the third night. Off-line learning on the tracking task was assessed. Pearsonâ€™s correlations assessed for associations between the magnitude of off-line learning and sleep variables, age, upper extremity motor function, stroke severity, depression and time since stroke occurrence. Results: Individuals with stroke performed with significantly less error on the tracking task following a night of sleep (p=. 006) while the control participants did not (p=. 816). Increased sleep efficiency (r= -. 285), less time spent in stage <b>NREM</b> 3 <b>sleep</b> (r=. 260), and more time spent in stage REM sleep (r= -. 266) was weakly-to-moderately associated with increased magnitude of off-line motor learning. Furthermore, higher upper-extremity motor function (r = -. 400), lower stroke severity (r =. 360), and less time since stroke occurrence (r=. 311) were moderately associated with increased magnitude of off-line motor learning. Conclusion: This study is the first study to provide insight into which sleep stages and individual characteristics may be associated with off-line learning in people with stroke. Future work should continue to understand which factors or combination of factors promote off-line motor learning in people with neurologic injury to best promote motor recovery in these individuals...|$|R
