40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the in vivo mechanism of non-responding to infliximab treatment {{of patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{and the role of}} anti-infliximab antibodies by using radiolabeled infliximab. DESIGN: Descriptive and comparative study. METHOD: Two responding and two non-responding RA patients were infused with radiolabeled infliximab. Subsequently imaging investigations and serum analysis were performed at set times. RESULTS: The scintigrams showed that the labelled infliximab was mainly present in the blood until 24 h after infusion. There was a trend of faster blood clearance and higher liver and spleen uptake of 99 mTc-infliximab in one <b>non-responding</b> <b>patient.</b> Labelled infliximab was taken up by inflamed joints. The anti-infliximab level was high (1008 and 1641 U/ml) in the non-responders and low or not detectable in the responders. Sucrose gradients of serum revealed antibody complexes in both non-responders. Various sizes of antibody complexes, including very large ones, were observed in one non-responder who developed a serious infusion reaction. CONCLUSION: Infliximab-anti-infliximab immune complexes were found to form in RA non-responders due to the presence of significant quantities of anti-infliximab. This finding may partly explain the failure of the infliximab treatmen...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis are currently successfully treated with infliximab (anti-tumour necrosis factor); however, about 30 % {{of the patients}} {{do not respond to}} infliximab. One of the postulated hypotheses of not responding is the fast clearance of infliximab due to the development of infliximab-anti-infliximab complexes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the in vivo mechanism of not responding and the role of human anti-chimeric antibodies (HACAs) by using radiolabelled infliximab. METHODS: Two responding and two non-responding {{patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis, infused with radiolabelled infliximab, were investigated by both imaging and serum analysis. RESULTS: Images showed predominant presence of infliximab in blood up to 24 h, with a trend of faster blood clearance and of higher liver/spleen uptake in a <b>non-responding</b> <b>patient.</b> Clinically inflamed joints showed uptake of the drug. The HACA level in the non-responders was high (1641 and 1008 U/ml), but low or not detectable in responders. Sucrose gradients of serum showed antibody complexes in both non-responders. Various sizes of antibody complexes, including very large ones, were observed in a non-responder who developed a serious infusion reaction. CONCLUSION: Formation of infliximab-anti-infliximab complexes were found in non-responders due to the presence of large amounts of HACA. This finding, supported by both imaging and serum analysis data, may explain failure of infliximab treatmen...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{survival in}} afatinib-treated patients after treatment with first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and to study resistance mechanisms in afatinib-resistant tumors. Methods: Characteristics and survival of patients treated with afatinib after resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib in two large Dutch centers were collected. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and pathway {{analysis was performed}} on available pre-and post-afatinib tumor biopsies and normal tissue. Results: A total of 38 patients were treated with afatinib. T 790 M mutations were identified in 22 / 29 (76 %) pre-afatinib treatment tumor samples. No difference in median progression-free-survival (2. 8 months (95 % CI 2. 3 - 3. 3) and 2. 7 months (95 % CI 0. 9 - 4. 6), p = 0. 55) and median overall-survival (8. 8 months (95 % CI 4. 2 - 13. 4) and 3. 6 months (95 % CI 2. 3 - 5. 0), p = 0. 14) were observed in T 790 M+ patients compared to T 790 M-mutations.  Somatic mutations in TP 53, ADAMTS 2, CNN 2 and multiple genes in the Wnt and PI 3 K-AKT pathway were observed in post-afatinib tumors of six afatinib-responding and in one <b>non-responding</b> <b>patient.</b> No new EGFR mutations {{were found in the}} post-afatinib samples of the six responding patients. Further analyses of post-afatinib progressive tumors revealed 28 resistant specific mutations in six genes (HLA-DRB 1, AQP 7, FAM 198 A, SEC 31 A, CNTLN, and ESX 1) in three afatinib responding patients. No known EGFR-TKI resistant-associated copy number gains were acquired in the post-afatinib samples. Conclusion: No differences in survival were observed in patients with EGFR-T 790 M treated with afatinib compared to those without T 790 M. Tumors from patients who had progressive disease during afatinib treatment were enriched for mutations in genes involved in Wnt and PI 3 K-AKT pathways...|$|E

40|$|Eighty-one {{postmenopausal}} women with advanced breast cancer were studied {{for the effects}} of treatment with aminoglutethimide (AG) plus hydrocortisone on peripheral hormones and response to therapy. There were 40 responders (R) and 41 non-responders (NR) at 3 months from the start of treatment. Plasma oestrone concentrations were higher in non-responders at 1 and 2 months after starting AG (Means: NR 106 +/- 50, R 84 +/- 26 pmol l- 1, P less than 0. 05; highest value NR 121 +/- 51, R 99 +/- 24 pmol l- 1, P less than 0. 05). High oestrone levels were correlated with bulky liver secondaries, but not with age, tumour-free interval, time from last menstrual period, time from relapse to start of AG or body weight. Non-responders had higher mean prolactin levels on treatment (prolactin less than 500 mIUl- 1 in 14 / 40 NR, 2 / 35 R, P less than 0. 01). High oestrone or prolactin levels were present in 28 / 41 NR and 6 / 40 R (P less than 0. 001). Dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate suppression did not differ between R and NR.

40|$|AbstractPURPOSE: Ultrasound elastography {{is a new}} imaging {{technique}} {{that can be used}} to assess tissue stiffness. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of ultrasound elastography for monitoring treatment response of locally advanced breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS: Fifteen women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy had the affected breast scanned before, 1, 4, and 8 weeks following therapy initiation, and then before surgery. Changes in elastographic parameters related to tissue biomechanical properties were then determined and compared to clinical and pathologic tumor response after mastectomy. RESULTS: Patients who responded to therapy demonstrated a significant decrease (P <. 05) in strain ratios and strain differences 4 weeks after treatment initiation compared to <b>non-responding</b> <b>patients.</b> Mean strain ratio and mean strain difference for responders was 81 ± 3 % and 1 ± 17 % for static regions of interest (ROIs) and 81 ± 3 % and 6 ± 18 % for dynamic ROIs, respectively. In contrast, these parameters were 102 ± 2 %, 110 ± 17 %, 101 ± 4 %, and 109 ± 30 % for <b>non-responding</b> <b>patients,</b> respectively. Strain ratio using static ROIs was found to be the best predictor of treatment response, with 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity obtained 4 weeks after starting treatment.

Thirty-five assays were successful and 25 {{patients with}} advanced disease subsequently received chemotherapy with the 'best' three drugs selected by the assay. Six patients were Karnofsky performance status 60 or less and the median pretreatment weight loss was 8. 5 %. Nine patients had a partial response (response rate = 36 %; 95 % confidence interval = 17 - 55 %) and the median survival of all patients was 202 days.

WBDWI was performed on eleven patients diagnosed with bone metastases from breast and prostate cancers before and after anti-cancer therapies. Semi-automatic segmentation incorporating a MRF model was performed in all patients below the C 4 vertebra by an experienced radiologist with over eight years of clinical experience in body DWI. Changes in tDV and gADC distributions were compared with overall response determined by all imaging, tumor markers and clinical findings at serial follow up. The segmentation technique was possible in all patients although erroneous volumes of interest were generated in one patient because of poor fat suppression in the pelvis, requiring manual correction. Responding patients showed a larger increase in gADC (median change = + 0. 18, range = - 0. 07 to + 0. 78 × 10 (- 3) mm 2 /s) after treatment compared to <b>non-responding</b> <b>patients</b> (median change = - 0. 02, range = - 0. 10 to + 0. 05 × 10 (- 3) mm 2 /s, p = 0. 05, Mann-Whitney test), whereas <b>non-responding</b> <b>patients</b> showed a significantly larger increase in tDV (median change = + 26 %, range = + 3 to + 284 %) compared to responding patients (median change = - 50 %, range = - 85 to + 27 %, p = 0. 02, Mann-Whitney test).

30|$|Meniscal cysts are fluid {{collections}} {{located within}} or {{adjacent to the}} meniscus (Fig.  16) and are caused by a fluid extravasation into the parameniscal soft tissue through a meniscal tear [25 – 28]. Meniscal tears have a horizontal component in most cases [28]. At MRI meniscal cysts are frequently septate; they present a fluid signal and are located close to a grade- 3 meniscal lesion. Lobulated cysts adjacent to a normal meniscus are generally not meniscal cysts but ganglions. The HFP oedema that sometimes is adjacent to a meniscal cyst is probably secondary to leakage of the fluid through the cyst’s wall. At the initial stage, non-surgical treatment of meniscal cysts is preferable. Ultrasound–guided local steroid-lidocaine injections can lessen local inflammation and alleviate <b>patient’s</b> pain.

The aim of this study was to explore the clinical importance of T lymphocyte subsets in adult patients with newly diagnosed ITP before and after first-line treatment. Elderly ITP patients were also studied and we tried to analyze the relationships between these items and therapeutic outcomes. The patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) plus corticosteroids and therapeutic responses were evaluated. As a result, compared with the controls, absolute lymphocyte counts in ITP patients decreased significantly before treatment. After treatment, lymphocyte counts restored to control level regardless of their treatment outcomes. In addition, we observed increased IgG and CD 19 + cell expression and decreased CD 4 +/CD 8 + cell ratio in both whole ITP group and elderly group before treatment. After treatment, the increased IgG and CD 19 + cell expression could be reduced in both respond and non-respond group regardless of patient age, while CD 4 +/CD 8 + cell ratio could not be corrected in <b>non-respond</b> ITP <b>patients.</b> In <b>non-respond</b> ITP <b>patients,</b> increased CD 8 + cell expression was noticed and could not be corrected by first-line treatment. Furthermore, even lower NK cell expression was found in <b>non-respond</b> elderly <b>patients</b> after treatment when compared with that in controls. Our findings suggest that ITP patients usually had less numbers of peripheral lymphocytes and patients with higher levels of CD 8 + cells or lower levels of CD 4 +/CD 8 + cell ratio were less likely to respond to first-line treatment. Lower levels of NK cells made therapies in elderly ITP patients even more difficult...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY No-response to {{antiviral}} {{therapy was}} observed {{in the majority of}} chronic hepatitis C patients treated with interferon alpha (IFN-a) monotherapy, but continues to represent a frequent problem even after treatment with newer, more potent, combination regimens. <b>Non-responding</b> <b>patients</b> represent a fairly heterogeneous group. Subgroups of nonresponders with biochemical but without virological response, or with breakthrough phenomena during therapy probably have a relatively more favorable prognosis. Retreatment with consensus IFN may be relatively effective, while the combination of IFN-a in usual dosage and ribavirin (RIB) achieves sustained virological response in 13 % and 21 % of such patients treated for 6 and 12 months, respectively. Induction courses of IFN-a in combination with RIB have been found to achieve initial virological response in 36 - 40 % and sustained virological response in 17 - 26 %. Triple antiviral therapy with IFN-a, RIB and amantadine has also been used, but more trials are needed for firm conclusions. Recently, the combination of pegylated IFN-a plus ribavirin was reported to achieve initial virological response in 36 - 40 % of <b>patients</b> <b>non-responding</b> to IFN-a monotherapy or to a combination of IFN-a plus ribavirin. Extensive data suggest that therapy with IFN-a may delay the progression of fibrosis and decrease the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma even in non-responding chronic hepatitis C patients. Thus, the decision whether or not to discon-tinue the antiviral therapy in non-responders is related to whether therapy aims the clearance of the virus or just a histological benefit.

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) using the positron emitting glucose analogue 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) {{has emerged as}} a useful metabolism-based wholebody imaging tool for gastro-esophageal cancer diagnosis and follow up. Most large cancer centers worldwide are now equipped for PET (or even PET-CT). Therefore, there is a growing need for a clear definition of the relative position of PET within the currently available diagnostic modalities. Significant scientific data indicate that FDG-PET adds clinically useful information to the information obtained by standard means (mainly CT and endoscopic ultrasound) throughout the different phases of clinical patient management: 1) at initial diagnosis: PET detects more frequently distant lymph node involvement and organ metastases compared to conventional diagnostics, allowing a more accurate selection of the most appropriate treatment; 2) during chemotherapy: semi-quantitative FDG-PET allows early identification of <b>non-responding</b> <b>patients.</b> Indeed, the metabolic response as measured by serial FDG-PET can be used to predict the clinical and histopathological response. Moreover, the PET-response seems to be related to overall and disease free survival; 3) after a treatment: FDG-PET allows accurate assessment of the residual tumor load; 4) in the follow up: FDG-PET allows accurate detection and restaging of recurrent disease. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Administration of first-in-class anti-EGFR {{monoclonal}} antibody cetuximab is contingent upon extensive pharmacogenomic testing. However {{in addition to}} tumor genomics, drug exposure levels could play a critical, yet largely underestimated role, because several reports have demonstrated that cetuximab pharmacokinetic parameters, in particular clearance values, were associated with survival in patients. Here, we have developed an original bioanalytical method based upon the use of LC-MS/MS technology and a simplified sample preparation procedure to assay cetuximab in plasma samples from patients, thus meeting the requirements of standard Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in routine clinical practice. When tested prospectively in a pilot study in 25 head-and-neck cancer patients, this method showed that patients with clinical benefit had cetixumab residual concentrations higher than <b>non-responding</b> <b>patients</b> (i. e., 49 +/- 16. 3 mu g/ml VS. 25. 8 +/- 17 mu g/ml, p < 0. 01 t test). Further ROC analysis showed that 33. 8 mu g/ml was the Cmin threshold predictive of response with an acceptable sensitivity (87 %) and specificity (78 %). Mass spectrometry-based therapeutic drug monitoring of cetuximab in head-and-neck cancer patients could therefore help to rapidly predict cetuximab efficacy and to adapt dosing if required...|$|R
40|$|Background: Low-dose aspirin is {{used for}} the {{prevention}} of thrombosis in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Patients failing to respond to their aspirin are classified as Aspirin Resistant (AR) and are at a greater risk of having a cardiovascular event (CVE). Our study sets out to: evaluate aspirin response in a real world cardiovascular population, assess the utility of Platelet Function Tests (PFT 2 ̆ 7 s) in the clinic and identify causes of AR, with the overall aim of improving patient clinical outcomes. Methods: Aspirin <b>non-responding</b> <b>patients</b> were identified using laboratory based methods (Light Transmission Aggregometry with arachidonic acid, VerifyNow™-Aspirin, serum thromboxane B 2) to screen a cardiovascular diseased patient population. Interventions (interview and education) were used to encourage and ensure compliance and aspirin brands were switched from 75 mg enteric-coated to 75 mg un-coated and increased to a max. dose of 300 mg un-coated aspirin until premium in vitro aspirin response was achieved by all three assays. Results: 248 (65 ± 10 yr, 79 ± 14 kg) patients were screened for their response to aspirin by at least one of three in vitro platelet function tests. 29...|$|R
40|$|Azacytidine for acute {{myeloid leukemia}} in elderly or frail {{patients}}: a phase II trial (SAKK 30 / 07) PASSWEG, Jakob, et al. This phase II trial treated elderly or frail patients with {{acute myeloid leukemia}} (AML) with single-agent subcutaneous azacytidine at 100 mg/m(2), on 5 of 28 days {{for up to six}} cycles. Treatment was stopped for lack of response, or continued to progression in responders. The primary endpoint was response within 6 months. A response rate ≥ 34 % was considered a positive trial outcome. From September 2008 to April 2010, 45 patients from 10 centers (median age 74 [55 - 86] years) were accrued. Patients received four (1 - 21) cycles. Best response was complete response/complete response with incomplete recovery of neutrophils and/or platelets (CR/CRi) in eight (18 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 8 - 32 %.), 0 (0 %) partial response (PR), seven (16 %) hematologic improvement, 17 (38 %) stable disease. Three <b>non-responding</b> <b>patients</b> stopped treatment after six cycles, 31 patients stopped early and 11 patients continued treatment for 8 - 21 cycles.

40|$|Identification of {{patients}} with Hodgkin's lymphoma who are primary refractory to chemotherapy will have great impact on treatment planning. Several {{studies have indicated that}} up-regulation of the bcl- 2 protooncogene expression in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can cause resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, For this reason we investigated the relationship between expression of bcl- 2, the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and MIB- 1 with clinical drug-resistance in Hodgkin's lymphoma Methods and results: Seven patients with nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma under 40 years of age, who failed to achieve complete remission upon primary chemotherapy and 10 matched patients who did achieve complete response were selected from the Eindhoven Cancer Registry Tissue sections from both groups {{of patients}} were stained for bcl- 2, Bax and MIB- 1, In the <b>non-responding</b> <b>patients</b> Reed-Sternberg cells expressed bcl- 2 more frequently using a cut-off point of Conclusion: A high percentage of Reed-Sternberg cells expressing bcl- 2 protein and a low expression of bcl- 2 protein in the surrounding lymphocytes is associated with treatment-failure, and subsequent poor survival in young patients with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma. These results need further validation in larger studies...|$|R
40|$|This is an open-access paper. [...] PETHEMA Group: et al. This phase Ib/II trial {{combined}} the pan-deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat with chemotherapy followed by panobinostat maintenance in elderly patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Patients with prior history of myelodysplastic syndrome were excluded and 38 evaluable patients {{were included in}} the study (median age: 71 years; range: 65 – 83). Study patients received an induction with idarubicin (8 mg/m 2 iv days 1 – 3) plus cytarabine (100 mg/m 2 iv days 1 – 7) plus panobinostat po at escalating doses (days 8, 10, 12, 15, 17 and 19) that could be repeated in <b>non-responding</b> <b>patients.</b> Patients achieving complete remission received a consolidation cycle with the same schema, followed by panobinostat maintenance (40 mg po 3 days/week) every other week until progression. Thirty-one patients were treated at the maximum tolerated dose of panobinostat in the combination (10 mg) with good tolerability. Complete remission rate was 64 % with a time to relapse of 17. 0 months (12. 8 – 21. 1). Median overall survival for the whole series was 17 months (5. 5 – 28. 4). Moreover, in 4 of 5 patients with persistent minimal residual disease before maintenance, panobinostat monotherapy reduced its levels, with complete negativization in two of them. Maintenance phase was well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events were thrombocytopenia (25 % grades 3 / 4), and gastrointestinal toxicity, asthenia and anorexia (mainly grades 1 / 2). Five patients required dose reduction during this phase, but only one discontinued therapy due to toxicity. These results suggest that panobinostat {{is one of the first}} novel agents with activity in elderly acute myeloid leukemia patients, and suggest further investigation is warranted, particularly in the context of maintenance therapy.
