5000|$|Reid {{comes to}} the {{conclusion}} that the <b>net</b> <b>burden</b> on imports were not likely to have been more than two to three percent. [...] Compared with other nations, colonists experienced less of a tax burden than anyone and had a higher standard of living. However, most of the economic burden experienced by the colonies came in the form of lost trade. Additionally, the being under British rule gave the colonialists many benefits, such as military protection from the Native Americans. Ultimately, Reid concludes that “conflicting economic interests sufficed to start the American Revolution.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Historian Robert Thomas (1965) {{argues that}} the impact of the Acts on the economies of the 13 American colonies was minimal; the cost was about ₤4 per ₤1000 of income per year. The average {{personal}} income was about ₤100 per year. However Ransom (1968) says that the <b>net</b> <b>burden</b> imposed by the Acts was small in size, yet their overall impact on the shape and growth rate of the economy was significant. That was because the Acts differentially affected different groups, helping some and hurting others. Walton concludes that the political friction caused by the Acts was more serious than the negative economic impact, especially since the merchants most affected were politically most active. Sawers (1992) points out that the political issue is what would have been the future impact of the Acts after 1776 as the colonial economy matured and was blocked by the Acts from serious competition with British manufacturers. In 1995, a random survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association found that 89 percent of economists and historians would generally agree that the [...] "costs imposed on American colonists by the trade restrictions of the Navigation Acts were small." ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Evaluation of nonenhancing tumor (<b>NET)</b> <b>burden</b> is an {{important}} yet challenging part of brain tumor response assessment. This study focuses on using dual-echo turbo spin-echo MRI {{as a means of}} quickly estimating tissue T 2, which can be used to objectively define <b>NET</b> <b>burden.</b> Experimental Design: A series of experiments were performed to establish the use of T 2 maps for defining <b>NET</b> <b>burden.</b> First, variation in T 2 was determined using the American College of Radiology (ACR) water phantoms in 16 scanners evaluated over 3 years. Next, the sensitivity and specificity of T 2 maps for delineating NET from other tissues were examined. Then, T 2 -defined NET was used to predict survival in separate subsets of patients with glioblastoma treated with radiotherapy, concurrent radiation, and chemotherapy, or bevacizumab at recurrence. Results: Variability in T 2 in the ACR phantom was 3 % to 5 %. In training data, ROC analysis suggested that 125 ms 90 % and specificity of > 65 %. Using this criterion, <b>NET</b> <b>burden</b> after completion of radiotherapy alone, or concurrent radiotherapy, and chemotherapy was shown to be predictive of survival (Cox, P < 0. 05), and the change in NET volume before and after bevacizumab therapy in recurrent glioblastoma was also a predictive of survival (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: T 2 maps using dual-echo data are feasible, stable, and can be used to objectively define <b>NET</b> <b>burden</b> for use in brain tumor characterization, prognosis, and response assessment. The use of effective T 2 maps for defining <b>NET</b> <b>burden</b> should be validated in a randomized, clinical trial...|$|E

40|$|Uncertainty is a {{fundamental}} characteristic of climate change. This paper focuses on uncertainty {{in the implementation of}} climate policy, especially as it affects the level and distribution of the burden on households that results from the allocation of emissions allowances. We examine the Waxman–Markey bill (H. R. 2454), introduced in the U. S. House of Representatives in 2009, with bookend scenarios labeled optimistic and pessimistic. The scenarios illustrate varied outcomes associated with allocations to electricity local distribution companies, investments in energy efficiency, and technology development. We introduce a third scenario for comparison, which allocates a substantial portion of allowance value directly to households as lump-sum payments. We find the average <b>net</b> household <b>burden</b> in 2016 in the optimistic scenario to be $ 133 with a CO 2 allowance price of $ 13. 19. In the pessimistic scenario, the <b>net</b> household <b>burden</b> rises to $ 418, with an allowance price of $ 23. 41. While the burden varies by income group, the relative impacts stay roughly the same in the optimistic and pessimistic cases, thus the uncertainty in average burdens does not carry over to uncertainty in the distribution of those burdens. Both scenarios impose the greatest burden as a percentage of income on middle-income households. Allocation of allowance value directly back to households as a lump-sum payment imposes an average <b>net</b> household <b>burden</b> of $ 206 with much less uncertainty in outcome; the distributional impacts are highly progressive. cap and trade, allocation, distributional effects, cost burden, equity, regulation,local distribution companies...|$|R

The paper first explains the raison d’etre of public pension systems and then discusses financing systems of public pensions (funding system and pay-as-you-go system). Under the pay as you go system, the benefits to the elderly at the introduction of the pension system are equal to the sum of the present discounted value of <b>net</b> <b>burden</b> of all generations born thereafter. Also, the pay as you go pension system has a huge amount of net pension debt, which must be borne by future generations. The paper points out that shifting to a funding system is an issue of how many years the repayment of such net liabilities should desirably be spread over. Finally, although consumption tax is generally thought to be a desirable revenue source of the pension system, we point out this idea is incorrect from a theoretical view point...|$|E

We show that defined benefit pension arrangements can be destabilizing, but less so if an average-wage variable-indexation contract is chosen. Government can help by adopting a policy of tax smoothing, but the single most important determinant of the <b>net</b> <b>burden</b> of ageing is the eventual size of the increase in labor market participation of older workers.

40|$|We analyse the {{distributional}} {{impact of}} financing {{energy and environmental}} policies through additional charges on electricity consumption, focussing on the impact Ireland’s flat-rate Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy has on domestic consumers. Switching Ireland’s flate-rate charge to a unit-based charge results in reduced regressivity across the entire income distribution. A unit-based scheme reduces aggregate burden for most households on low incomes. Regressive impacts are greater for a subset of heavy electricity users. Incremental block pricing (IBP) exaggerates these effects. A hybrid fixed/variable structure mitigates regressivity for high users but lessens overall regressivity reduction. Redistribution via Ireland’s Household Benefits Package is sub-optimal relative to a hypothetical equivalised income-based scheme. Net of ‘merit order’ savings, flat charges redistribute burden incidence from rich to poor whilst fixed per-unit charges have a neutral effect. IBP shifts cost to heavy users, predominantly large households. IBP results in a negative <b>net</b> <b>burden</b> {{for the majority of}} households across all income groups. ...|$|E
40|$|Decisions {{concerning}} {{environmental protection}} hinge on estimates of economic burden. Over the past 30 years, economists have developed and applied various tools to measure this burden. In this chapter, {{we present a}} taxonomy of costs along with methods for measuring those costs. At the broadest level, we distinguish between partial and general equilibrium costs. Partial equilibrium costs represent the burden directly borne by the regulated entity (firms, households, government), including both pecuniary and nonpecuniary expenses, when prices are held constant. General equilibrium costs reflect the <b>net</b> <b>burden</b> once all good and factor markets have equilibrated. In addition to partial equilibrium costs, these general equilibrium costs include welfare losses or gains in markets with preexisting distortions, welfare losses or gains from rebalancing the government's budget constraint, and welfare gains from the added flexibility of meeting pollution constraints through reductions {{in the use of}} higher-priced, pollution-intensive products. In addition to both partial and general equilibrium costs, we also consider the distribution of costs across households, countries, sectors, subnational regions, and generations. Despite improvements in our understanding of cost measurement, we find considerable opportunity for further work and, especially, better application of existing methods. ...|$|E

Therefore, the sector is no longer quite as central to fiscal concerns {{as it was in}} the past. But the design of financial sector taxation still tends to be arbitrary and distorting, and subject to sharp fluctuations in response to political and macroeconomic pressures. Poor tax design can impede the effective functions of the financial sector. The main principles governing good design of taxation for financial intermediation parallel those for other sectors. Financial sector taxation cannot in practice be considered in isolation from the remainder of the tax system, in terms of achieving both static and dynamic (growth-promoting) efficiency and equity.
