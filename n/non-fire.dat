5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is relatively}} common, resulting {{in more than}} 20,000 emergency room visits {{a year in the}} United States. It is {{the most common type of}} fatal poisoning in many countries. In the United States <b>non-fire</b> related cases results in more than 400 deaths a year. Poisonings occur more often in the winter, particularly from the use of portable generators during power outages. The toxic effects of CO have been known since ancient history. The realization that hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.|$|E

2500|$|One aspect {{which several}} {{investigations}} {{brought to the}} fore was the impact on firefighting efforts. An investigation into the July 1994 South Canyon fire in Colorado, which killed 14 firefighters, concluded that [...] "Air support was inadequate for implementing strategies and tactics." [...] Eitel has alleged {{that the reason for}} inadequate air support was that the aircraft from the exchange program which should have been available to fire managers were instead doing <b>non-fire</b> related work, some of it secret, around the world.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} {{theoretically}} about the associative memory capabilities of neural networks in which information is encoded {{not only in}} the mean firing rate but also in the timing of firings. Particularly, in the case that the fraction of active neurons involved in memorizing patterns becomes small, it is biologically important to consider the timings of firings and to study how such consideration influences storage capacities and quality of recalled patterns. For this purpose, we propose a simple extended model of oscillator neural networks to allow for expression of <b>non-firing</b> state. %which is able to memorize sparsely coded phase patterns including <b>non-firing</b> states. Analyzing both equilibrium states and dynamical properties in recalling processes, we find that the system possesses good associative memory.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited 13. ABSTRACT WPaaomum 200 words) Evaluating the thermal performance of tank cannon components, such as thermal shrouds, muzzle reference system collimators, barrel paint, or thermal signature, {{by means of}} firing live ammunition has distinct drawbacks. Not only is range time uncertain, labor and ammunition expensive, but firing must be done outdoors, where uncontrollable environmental factors (such as sunlight, precipitation, and wind) may complicate the analysis and make experimental repeatability difficult. This report will discuss <b>non-firing</b> test alternatives, using various laboratory heat-ing devices, to input heat to the barrel and its accessories in a controllable and repeatable fashion. ...|$|R
