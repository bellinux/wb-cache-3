40|$|Abstract Background Hepcidin/LEAP- 1 is an iron {{regulatory}} hormone originally {{identified as}} an antimicrobial peptide. As part of a systematic analysis {{of the evolution of}} host defense peptides in primates, we have sequenced the orthologous gene from 14 species of non-human primates. Results The sequence of the mature peptide is highly conserved amongst all the analyzed species, being identical to the human one in great apes and gibbons, with a single residue conservative variation in Old-World monkeys and with few substitutions in <b>New-World</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Conclusion Our analysis indicates that hepcidin's role as a regulatory hormone, which involves interaction with a conserved receptor (ferroportin), may result in conservation over most of its sequence, {{with the exception of the}} stretch between residues 15 and 18, which in <b>New-World</b> <b>monkeys</b> (as well as in other mammals) shows a significant variation, possibly indicating that this structural region is involved in other functions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Area V 5 (middle temporal) in the {{superior}} temporal sulcus of macaque receives a direct projection {{from the primary}} visual cortex (V 1). By injecting anterograde tracers (biotinylated dextran and Phaseolus vulgaris lectin) into V 1, we have examined the synaptic boutons that they form in V 5 in the electron microscope. Nearly 80 % of the target cells in V 5 were spiny (excitatory). The boutons formed asymmetric (Gray’s type 1) synapses with spines (54 %), dendrites (33 %), and somata (13 %). All somatic targets and some (26 %) of the target dendritic shafts showed features characteristic of smooth (inhibitory) cells. Each bouton formed, on average, 1. 7 synapses. The larger boutons formed multiple synapses with the same neuron The best-studied extrastriate area is that first discovered by Zeki (1969), who used anatomical methods to define an area in the posterior bank of {{the superior}} temporal sulcus in macaque monkey that received an input from area 17. The homologous area in the <b>new-world</b> <b>monkey</b> is the middle temporal area (MT) (Allman and Kaas, 1971). From the earliest recordings, {{it was evident that}} the neurons of this area, now called MT or V 5, were particularly sensitive to the direction and velocity of motion of the stimulus (Dubner and Zeki, 1971). There are both direct and indirect projections from V 1 to are...|$|R
40|$|Among {{vertebrates}} the neurohypophysial hormones show considerable variation. However, in eutherian mammals {{they have}} been considered rather conserved, with arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) in all species except pig and some relatives, where lysine vasopressin replaces AVP. The availability of genomic data {{for a wide range}} of mammals makes it possible to assess whether these peptides and their precursors may be more variable in Eutheria than previously suspected. A survey of these data confirms that AVP and OT occur in most eutherians, but with exceptions. In a <b>New-World</b> <b>monkey</b> (marmoset, Callithrix jacchus) and in tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri), Pro 8 OT replaces OT, confirming a recent report for these species. In armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) Leu 3 OT replaces OT, while in tenrec (Echinops telfairi) Thr 4 AVP replaces AVP. In these two species there is also evidence for additional genes/pseudogenes, encoding much-modified forms of AVP, but in most other eutherian species there is no evidence for additional neurohypophysial hormone genes. Evolutionary analysis shows that sequences of eutherian neurohypophysial hormone precursors are generally strongly conserved, particularly those regions encoding active peptide and neurophysin. The close association between OT and VP genes has led to frequent gene conversion of sequences encoding neurophysins. A monotreme, platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) has genes for OT and AVP, organized tail-to-tail as in eutherians, but in marsupials 3 - 4 genes are present for neurohypophysial hormones, organized tail-to-head as in lower vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|Translational animal {{models for}} human asthma are necessary, {{especially}} for preclinical drug testing. The small-bodied <b>New-World</b> <b>monkey</b> species common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is particularly suitable {{to develop an}} animal model that is close to humans but more reasonable and easier to handle than classic primate models in macaques. The hypothesis was {{that it is possible}} to sensitize marmosets against house-dust-mite (HDM) to generate an asthma-like condition including lung eosinophilia and allergen-specific secretion of interleukin 13 (IL 13) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Twelve animals were sensitized against HDM extract (Greer) over a course of six weeks. Sham-sensitized animals (n= 6) only received the adjuvant. A month after sensitization, intratracheal (i. t.) HDM allergen challenge was performed for half of these animals to date. PBMCs were isolated from blood before and after sensitization. 2 x 105 cells were seeded in cell culture medium and stimulated with 10 g/ml HDM and 10 g/ml HDM plus 50 g/ml dexamethasone (ratiopharm), respectively. 96 h after cultivation under cell culture conditions, supernatants were collected and evaluated. Detection of IL 13 was performed using a commercial ELISA (UCyTech). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed before and after the challenge phase and BAL fluid (BALF) was analyzed for cytokines and cellular composition. Allergen stimulated PBMCs of sensitized marmosets showed higher IL 13 levels post sensitization, compared to pre-sensitization and sham-sensitized animals (34. 2 ± 10. 5, 2. 5 ± 0. 7 and 6. 8 ± 4. 1 pg/ml; mean±SEM; p= 0. 001 Wilcoxon test and p= 0. 024 Mann-Whitney test; n= 12 / 6). HDM-induced IL 13 -release could be drastically reduced by dexamethasone (1. 3 ± 0. 2 pg/ml; mean±SEM; p= 0. 016 Wilcoxon test; n= 7). Total cell counts for sensitized animals increased after HDM-challenge (3. 0 ± 0. 5 x 105 vs. 1. 3 ± 0. 3 x 105 cells/ml BALF; mean±SEM; p= 0. 031 Wilcoxon test; n= 6). Likewise eosinophil numbers in BALF rose for sensitized animals (14. 0 vs. 0. 8 %; median; p= 0. 031 Wilcoxon test; n= 6) but not for sham-sensitized animals (1. 5 vs. 1. 0 %; median; n= 3). IL 13 levels measured from BALF supernatants were slightly higher for sensitized animals after HDM-challenge. Further investigations of cutaneous reactivity towards HDM revealed positive reactions for half of the sensitized animals. HDM-specific IL 13 secretion of marmoset PBMCs indicates a successful sensitization against HDM. Allergen challenge of sensitized animals resulted in an influx of cells, predominantly eosinophils, into the lung, a characteristic feature of asthma in humans. Novel readout parameters such as detection of asthma-relevant cytokine levels via real-time PCR and measuring immunoglobulin levels are under investigation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractVaccines {{based on}} {{adenovirus}} (Ad) vectors {{are currently in}} development against several pathogens. However, neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to human adenovirus type 5 (AdHu 5), the best-studied vector, are highly prevalent in humans worldwide. Less-prevalent adenoviruses, including human and simian serotypes, provide alternative vaccine platforms. In this study, sera from 200 Brazilian human subjects and <b>New-World</b> <b>monkeys</b> were tested for NAb titers to human serotypes AdHu 5 and AdHu 26 and chimpanzee-origin Ad viruses of serotype 6 (AdC 6) and serotype 68 (AdC 68). Seroprevalence rates of NAb in humans were 69. 5 % for AdHu 5, 44 % for AdHu 26, 21 % for AdC 6 and 23. 5 % for AdC 68. In addition, NAb titers to human Ad were consistently higher than those found to simian serotypes. Surprisingly, sera from some New-World monkey species were able to neutralize AdC 6 and/or AdC 68. A possible explanation for these findings and the implications {{for the development of}} Ad-vector vaccines are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of the lymphotropic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) ' with certain human lymphoproliferative diseases {{and its ability to}} transform normal lymphocytes into established in vitro lines have prompted the present investigations. Primary EBV infection of certain age groups causes infectious mononucleosis, a self-limiting lymphoproliferative disease (1). Furthermore, the regular {{association of}} EBV with Burkitt's lymphoma cells in vivo has led to serious consideration of this virus, possibly some special subtype, as the etiological agent of the disease, alone or together with cofactors (2). Three lymphotropic herpesviruses are known to cause neoplastic disease in animals: Marek's disease herpesvirus (MDHV) in chickens, and herpesvirus Saimiri (HVS) and herpesvirus Ateles (HVA) in certain <b>new-world</b> <b>monkeys.</b> Like EBV, the proliferative interaction between the genomes of these herpesviruses and their lymphoid target cells is dependent on a nonpermissive relationship (3 - 5). It is a so far unchallenged rule for all known herpesviruses that the synthesis of viral proteins, including early products made before viral DNA synthesis, leads to an irreversibl...|$|E
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a {{ubiquitous}} herpesvirus infecting {{more than}} 90 % {{of the adult}} population of the world. EBV is associated with a variety of diseases including infectious mononucleosis, lymphoproliferative diseases, malignancies such as Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). EBV in nature infects only humans, but in an experimental setting, a limited species of <b>new-world</b> <b>monkeys</b> can be infected with the virus. Small animal models, suitable for evaluation of novel therapeutics and vaccines, have not been available. Humanized mice, defined here as mice harboring functioning human immune system components, are easily infected with EBV that targets cells of the hematoimmune system. Furthermore, humanized mice can mount both cellular and humoral immune responses to EBV. Thus, many aspects of human EBV infection, including associated diseases (e. g., lymphoproliferative disease, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and erosive arthritis resembling RA), latent infection, and T-cell-mediated and humoral immune responses have been successfully reproduced in humanized mice. Here we summarize recent achievements in the field of humanized mouse models of EBV infection and show how they have been utilized to analyze EBV pathogenesis and normal and aberrant human immune responses to the virus...|$|E
40|$|The {{nuclear and}} {{mitochondrial}} genomes coevolve to optimize approximately 100 different interactions necessary for an efficient ATP-generating system. This coevolution {{led to a}} species-specific compatibility between these genomes. We introduced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from different primates into mtDNA-less human cells and selected for growth of cells with a functional oxidative phosphorylation system. mtDNA from common chimpanzee, pigmy chimpanzee, and gorilla were able to restore oxidative phosphorylation {{in the context of}} a human nuclear background, whereas mtDNA from orangutan, and species representative of Old-World monkeys, <b>New-World</b> <b>monkeys,</b> and lemurs were not. Oxygen consumption, a sensitive index of respiratory function, showed that mtDNA from chimpanzee, pigmy chimpanzee, and gorilla replaced the human mtDNA and restored respiration to essentially normal levels. Mitochondrial protein synthesis was also unaltered in successful “xenomitochondrial cybrids. ” The abrupt failure of mtDNA from primate species that diverged from humans as recently as 8 – 18 million years ago to functionally replace human mtDNA suggests the presence of one or a few mutations affecting critical nuclear–mitochondrial genome interactions between these species. These cellular systems provide a demonstration of intergenus mtDNA transfer, expand more than 20 -fold the number of mtDNA polymorphisms that can be analyzed in a human nuclear background, and provide a novel model for the study of nuclear–mitochondrial interactions...|$|E

One B-lymphoblastoid cell line producing anti-P. brasilianum-specific antibody was cloned twice, and the immunoglobulin G produced was purified. This monoclonal antibody recognized a parasite component of 197 kDa and was specific for Plasmodium malariae and P. brasilianum parasites.
