5|$|Verville {{received}} many honors and awards, including a selection {{as a fellow}} of the Smithsonian Institution's <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum in 1962. An airmail stamp was issued in 1985 by the US Postal Service in Verville's honor. In 1991, he was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Aviation Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Enola Gay {{became the}} center of a {{controversy}} at the Smithsonian Institution when the museum planned to put its fuselage on public display in 1995 as part of an exhibit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The exhibit, The Crossroads: The End of World War II, the Atomic Bomb and the Cold War, was drafted by the Smithsonian's <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum staff, and arranged around the restored Enola Gay.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, Air France {{signed a}} letter of {{agreement}} to donate a Concorde to the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum in Washington D.C. upon the aircraft's retirement. On 12 June 2003, Air France honoured that agreement, donating Concorde F-BVFA (serial 205) to the Museum upon the completion of its last flight. This aircraft was the first Air France Concorde to open service to Rio de Janeiro, Washington, D.C., and New York and had flown 17,824 hours. It is {{on display at the}} Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles Airport.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{veterans}} groups {{engaged in}} a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum (NASM) in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The last survivor of its crew, Theodore Van Kirk, died on July 28, 2014, {{at the age of}} 93.|$|E

50|$|After the war, the USAF passed their A-37Bs {{from the}} USAF Tactical Air Command (TAC) to TAC-gained {{units in the}} <b>Air</b> <b>National</b> Guard <b>and</b> <b>Air</b> Force Reserve. In the early 1980s these {{aircraft}} {{were assigned to the}} FAC (Forward <b>Air</b> Control) role <b>and</b> given the designation OA-37B. The OA-37Bs were eventually phased out in the 1980s and 1990s and replaced in the FAC mission by the much more formidable Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II in <b>Air</b> Force, <b>Air</b> <b>National</b> Guard <b>and</b> <b>Air</b> Force Reserve service.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his forty-seven years in {{designing}} and building planes, Verville contributed to the design and development of nearly twenty different aircraft. A plane he designed, the Verville-Sperry M-1 Messenger is on permanent exhibition at the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. Another plane he designed, the Verville-Sperry R-3 Racer won first place at the 1924 Pulitzer Trophy Races. In June 1961, it was honored as one of the twelve most significant aircraft of all time by Popular Mechanics and it was featured on a USPS airmail stamp issued in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The Akutan Zero was {{destroyed}} during a training accident in February 1945. While the Zero was taxiing for a take-off, a Curtiss SB2C Helldiver lost control and rammed into it. The Helldiver's propeller sliced the Zero into pieces. From the wreckage, William N. Leonard salvaged several gauges, which he {{donated to the}} National Museum of the United States Navy. The Alaska Heritage Museum and the Smithsonian <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum also have small pieces of the Zero.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Wes Archer, {{and it was the}} first episode for which Al Jean and Mike Reiss served as show runners. It features multiple references to the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, including the scene in which Lisa appeals to Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial for advice. Other Washington landmarks referenced in the episode include the Jefferson Memorial, the Watergate Hotel, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the White House, the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum, and the Washington Monument.|$|E

5|$|There {{are only}} seven {{absolute}} world records for fixed-wing aircraft {{recognized by the}} Fédération Aéronautique Internationale and Fossett broke three {{of them in the}} Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer. All three records were previously held by Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager from their flight in the Voyager in 1986. Fossett contributed the GlobalFlyer to the Smithsonian Institution's permanent collection. It is on display at the Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian's <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum. Fossett flew the plane to the Center and taxied the plane to the front door.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the planned}} exhibit, {{especially}} those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association, charged that the exhibit focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, {{rather than on the}} motivations for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise the exhibit {{in order to meet the}} satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Lincoln Memorial, other Washington, D.C. landmarks visited include the Jefferson Memorial, the Watergate Hotel (where the family stays), the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the White House, the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum, and the Washington Monument. When the family visits the White House, they encounter then-First Lady Barbara Bush in the bathtub {{of one of the}} many bathrooms. Another American landmark mentioned in the episode is Mount Rushmore. The scene mentioning that landmark could imply that Springfield is Springfield, South Dakota since Mount Rushmore is in South Dakota. In addition, Lisa proposes that the family attend the memorial of the fictional Winifred Beecher Howe, an early crusader for women's rights who later appeared on the unpopular 75-cent coins according to Lisa. This is a reference to the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin, which was only minted for three years and never became popular.|$|E

5|$|Perkin-Elmer {{intended}} to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated computer-controlled polishing machines to grind the mirror to the required shape. However, in case their cutting-edge technology ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE sub-contract to Kodak to construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques. (The team of Kodak and Itek also bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later caused such problems.) The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum. An Itek mirror built {{as part of the}} effort is now used in the 2.4m telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Rich in {{cultural}} heritage, Virginia however ranks {{near the bottom}} of U.S. states in terms of public spending on the arts, at nearly half of the national average. The state government does fund some institutions, including the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the Science Museum of Virginia. Other museums include the popular Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum and the Chrysler Museum of Art. Besides these sites, many open-air museums are located in the Commonwealth, such as Colonial Williamsburg, the Frontier Culture Museum, and various historic battlefields. The Virginia Foundation for the Humanities works to improve the Commonwealth's civic, cultural, and intellectual life.|$|E
5|$|The Command Module Columbia was {{displayed}} at the <b>National</b> <b>Air</b> <b>and</b> Space Museum (NASM), Washington, D.C. It was in the central Milestones of Flight exhibition hall {{in front of the}} Jefferson Drive entrance, sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the Wright Flyer, the Spirit of St. Louis, the Bell X-1, the North American X-15, Mercury spacecraft Friendship 7, and Gemini 4. Armstrong's and Aldrin's space suits are displayed in the museum's Apollo to the Moon exhibit. The quarantine trailer, the flotation collar, and the righting spheres are displayed at the Smithsonian's Steven F.
