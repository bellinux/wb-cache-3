The CSTP was initiated in 1962 at the Sandy Hook Laboratory in New Jersey under the Department of Interior's U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

40|$|Previous {{attempts}} {{to conduct a}} stock assessment for the blue shark (Prionace glauca) in the North Atlantic have been handicapped {{by the lack of}} reliable catch and effort data. The use of tag-recapture data is among ICCAT’s recommendations for future assessment work. This paper proposes a statistical framework for estimating blue shark movement and fishing mortality rates from the tag-recapture data of the National Marine Fisheries Service <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Shark</b> <b>Tagging</b> Program (NMFS-CSTP). The model considers four geographical regions. Blue sharks can stay in the region in which they were tagged and they can move among regions. The parameters of the model are the intra- and inter-region movement probabilities and the catchability coefficients that relate the probabilities of capture and the ICCAT longline fishing effort data. Bayesian estimation methods are used to estimate and quantify the uncertainty associated with the values for these parameters. The dataset of the NMFS-CSTP shows potential for use in a blue shark stock assessment and should be investigated further. Areas of interest for future research are identified. RÉSUM...|$|R
40|$|Proportional {{survival}} (S) is {{a crucial}} life-history parameter in population dynamics, natural selection, and management of harvested stocks; variations in survival due to age, sex, or geographic region may have large effects {{on the success of}} managing fish stocks. The blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus, is the most abundantly harvested shark species in American fisheries. Direct estimates of survival are preferred, but all current survival estimates for this species are either focused on young-of-the-year (YOY) or based on indirect methods. The objectives of this study were to determine whether age, sex, or geographic grouping affects survival and to generate direct survival estimates based on tag-recovery data. As a byproduct of this analysis, distribution maps and descriptive data summarizing captures were included. The U. S. National Marine Fisheries Service has been collecting tag-recovery data since 1962 through the <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Shark</b> <b>Tagging</b> Program (CSTP). Models were generated from this database with program MARK, ranked in order of parsimony according to Akaike 2 ̆ 7 s Information Criterion, and tested for significance of effects with likelihood ratio tests. No movement has been observed to date between the west Gulf of Mexico, east Gulf of Mexico, and U. S. Atlantic, but 2 <b>sharks</b> <b>tagged</b> in the U. S. Virgin Islands were recaptured off Florida and Georgia (displacement= 1049 and 1183 n. mi., respectively). Survival did not differ significantly for males vs. females (P= 0. 761), east vs. west Gulf of Mexico (P= 0. 654), or U. S. Atlantic vs. Gulf of Mexico (P= 0. 243). However, significant differences were found for survival of YOY (0. 580) and post-YOY (0. 725) within the Gulf of Mexico (P= 0. 0003). These results demonstrate that survival can be modeled effectively for species in the CSTP with relatively small sample sizes. Future analyses may benefit from a length-based model, due to the difficulty in assigning life stages based on size. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a system of}} multiple coordi-nating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) that can localize and track a <b>shark</b> <b>tagged</b> with an acoustic transmitter. Each AUV {{is equipped with a}} stereo-hydrophone system that provides measurements of the relative bearing to the transmitter, as well as an acoustic modem that allows for inter-AUV communication and hence <b>cooperative</b> <b>shark</b> state estimation and decentralized tracking control. Online state estimation of the shark’s state is performed using a Particle Filter in which measurements are shared between AUVs. The decentralized control system enables the AUVs to circumnavigate a dynamic target, (i. e. the estimated shark location). Each AUV circles the target by tracking circles of different radii and at different phase angles with respect to the target so as to obtain simultaneous sensor vantage points and minimize chance of AUV collision. A series of experiments using two AUVs were conducted in Big Fisherman’s Cove in Santa Catalina Island, CA and demonstrated the ability to track a <b>tagged</b> leopard <b>shark</b> (Triakis semifasciata). The performance of the tracking was compared to standard manual tracking performed using an directional hydrophone operated by a researcher in a boat.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the integration of}} an acoustic tracking system within an autonomous underwater AUV (AUV) to enable real-time tracking of <b>sharks</b> <b>tagged</b> with artificial acoustic sources. The tracking system consists of two hydrophones and a receiver unit that outputs a measurement of the relative angle to the <b>tagged</b> <b>shark.</b> Since only two hydrophones are used, {{the sign of the}} relative angle measurement is unknown. To overcome this ambiguity, a particle filter algorithm was developed to estimate the position of the acoustic source. When combined with an active control system that drives vehicle to obtain different orientations with respect to the acoustic source, real-time autonomous localization, tracking, and following of a <b>tagged</b> <b>shark</b> is shown to be possible. Four types of ocean experiments were used to validate the system including: 1) AUV tracking of a stationary tag, 2) AUV tracking of a tagged kayak, 3) AUV tracking of a tagged AUV, and 4) AUV tracking of a <b>tagged</b> <b>shark.</b> These experiments were analyzed with respect to the localization error, associated error variance, and distance between the AUV and the <b>tag.</b> The final <b>shark</b> tracking experiments took place in SeaPlane Lagoon, Los Angeles, CA, where the AUV was able to autonomously track and follow a <b>tagged</b> Leopard <b>Shark</b> for several hours...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to track and pursue a <b>tagged</b> <b>shark</b> through the water. A {{controller}} was designed to take bearing and range to the <b>shark</b> <b>tag</b> and then control the AUV to pursue it. First, the ability of a particle filter to provide an accurate estimation of the location of the shark relative to the AUV is explored. Second, the ability of the AUV to follow the shark 2 ̆ 7 s path through the water is shown. This ability allows for localized environmental sampling of the shark 2 ̆ 7 s preferred path. Third, various path weightings are used to optimize the efficiency of pursuing the shark. This demonstrates that the proposed controller is efficient and effective. Fourth, the benefits of the addition of a second AUV are explored and quantified. The secondary AUV is shown to maintain formation without direct communication from the primary AUV. However, the communication of the AUVs increases the accuracy of all measurements and allows for future expansion in the complexity of the controller. Fifth, the effects of predicting the shark 2 ̆ 7 s future movement is explored. Sixth, the effect of noise in the signal from the <b>shark</b> <b>tag</b> is tested and the level of noise at which the AUV can no longer pursue the shark is shown. This investigates the real world ability of the controller to accept noisy inputs and still generate the appropriate response. Finally, the positive results of the previous sections are combined and tested for various noise levels to show the improved controller response even under increased noise levels. To validate the proposed estimator and controller, seven tests were conducted. All tests were conducted on existing shark path data recorded by a stationary acoustic receiver and a boat mounted acoustic receiver. Tests were conducted on data sets from two different species of sharks, (Shovelnose and White) with two very different swimming behaviors.

Fortunately, some movement data from these animals remain salvageable because manatees typically retain a peduncle belt containing an acoustic transmitter that can be detected with a submersible hydrophone. We deployed an array of moored datalogging hydrophones at key locations in our study area to detect manatee belt-embedded acoustic transmitters, a technique not typically used to track manatees. Our array was successful in detecting five tagged manatees, and concurrently detected compatible acoustic tags of other estuarine fauna (e. g. Bull <b>Sharks)</b> <b>tagged</b> by local researchers. Moored datalogging hydrophones, therefore, provided amethod to mitigate the loss of satellite tags from estuarine megafauna, and enhanced collaborative opportunities with researchers who tagged other species using compatible equipment...|$|R
