5|$|The most {{important}} use for phosphoryl chloride {{is in the}} manufacture of triarylphosphate esters (as described above) such as triphenyl phosphate and tricresyl phosphate. These esters have been used for many years as flame retardants and plasticisers for PVC. Meanwhile, trialkyl esters such as tributyl phosphate (made similarly from <b>n-butanol)</b> are used as liquid–liquid extraction solvents in nuclear reprocessing and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of cysts is induced {{by changes in}} the concentration of nutrients in the medium and addition of some organic substances such as ethanol, <b>n-butanol,</b> or β-hydroxybutyrate. Cysts are rarely formed in liquid media. The {{formation of}} cysts is induced by chemical factors and is accompanied by metabolic shifts, changes in catabolism, respiration, and biosynthesis of macromolecules; it is also affected by aldehyde dehydrogenase and the response regulator AlgR.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{toxicity}} of <b>n-butanol</b> is relatively low, with oral LD50 values of 790–4,360mg/kg (rat; comparable values for ethanol are 7,000–15,000mg/kg). No deaths were reported at an inhaled concentration of 8,000ppm (4-hour exposure, rats). At sub-lethal doses, <b>n-butanol</b> {{acts as a}} depressant of the central nervous system, similar to ethanol: one study in rats indicated that the intoxicating potency of <b>n-butanol</b> is some six times {{higher than that of}} ethanol, possibly because of its slower transformation by alcohol dehydrogenase.|$|E
25|$|Honey bees use <b>n-butanol</b> as an Alarm pheromone.|$|E
25|$|With a {{flash point}} of 35°C, <b>n-butanol</b> {{presents}} a moderate fire hazard: it is slightly more flammable than kerosene or diesel fuel but less flammable {{than many other}} common organic solvents. The depressant effect on {{the central nervous system}} (similar to ethanol intoxication) is a potential hazard when working with <b>n-butanol</b> in enclosed spaces, although the odour threshold (0.2–30ppm) is far below the concentration which would have any neurological effect.|$|E
25|$|The largest use of <b>n-butanol</b> is as an {{industrial}} intermediate, {{particularly for the}} manufacture of butyl acetate (itself an artificial flavorant and industrial solvent). It is a petrochemical, manufactured from propylene and usually used close {{to the point of}} manufacture. Estimated production figures for 1997 are: United States 784,000tonnes; Western Europe 575,000tonnes; Japan 225,000tonnes.|$|E
25|$|Isopropyl alcohol dissolves a {{wide range}} of {{non-polar}} compounds. It also evaporates quickly, leaves nearly zero oil traces, compared to ethanol, and is relatively non-toxic, compared to alternative solvents. Thus, it is used widely as a solvent and as a cleaning fluid, especially for dissolving oils. Together with ethanol, <b>n-butanol,</b> and methanol, it belongs to the group of alcohol solvents, about 6.4 million tonnes of which were utilized worldwide in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Consumer {{acceptance}} may {{be limited}} due to the potentially offensive banana-like smell of <b>n-butanol.</b> Plans are underway to market a fuel that is 85% Ethanol and 15% Butanol (E85B), so existing E85 internal combustion engines can run on a 100% renewable fuel {{that could be made}} without using any fossil fuels. Because its longer hydrocarbon chain causes it to be fairly non-polar, it is more similar to gasoline than it is to ethanol. Butanol has been demonstrated to work in vehicles designed for use with gasoline without modification.|$|E
25|$|The process {{involves}} a biological/chemical method for converting any biodegradable material (e.g., urban wastes, such as municipal solid waste, biodegradable waste, and sewage sludge, agricultural residues such as corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, cotton gin trash, manure) into useful chemicals, such as carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid), ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone) and biofuels, {{such as a}} mixture of primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, <b>n-butanol)</b> and/or a mixture of secondary alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol). Because of the many products that can be economically produced, this process is a true biorefinery.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>n-Butanol</b> is {{produced}} industrially from the petrochemical feedstock propylene.

2500|$|... <b>n-Butanol</b> {{is used as}} an {{ingredient}} in perfumes and as a solvent for the extraction of essential oils. <b>n-Butanol</b> is also used as an extractant {{in the manufacture of}} antibiotics, hormones, and vitamins; a solvent for paints, coatings, natural resins, gums, synthetic resins, dyes, alkaloids, and camphor. Other miscellaneous applications of <b>n-butanol</b> are as a swelling agent in textiles, as a component of hydraulic brake fluids, cleaning formulations, degreasers, and repellents; and as a component of ore floation agents, [...] and of wood-treating systems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{octane rating}} of <b>n-butanol</b> {{is similar to}} that of {{gasoline}} but lower than that of ethanol and methanol. <b>n-Butanol</b> has a RON (Research Octane number) of 96 and a MON (Motor octane number) of 78 (with a resulting [...] "(R+M)/2 pump octane number" [...] of 87, as used in North America) while t-butanol has octane ratings of 105 RON and 89 MON. t-Butanol is used as an additive in gasoline but cannot be used as a fuel in its pure form because its relatively high melting point of 25.5°C (79°F) causes it to gel and solidify near room temperature. On the other hand, isobutanol has a lower melting point than <b>n-butanol</b> and favorable RON of 113 and MON of 94, and is thus much better suited to high fraction gasoline blends, blends with <b>n-butanol,</b> or as a standalone fuel.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>n-Butanol</b> occurs {{naturally}} as {{a result}} of carbohydrate fermentation in a number of alcoholic beverages, including beer, grape brandies, wine, and whisky.

2500|$|... <b>n-Butanol</b> {{is readily}} absorbed through the {{intestinal}} tract and lungs, {{and also to}} some extent through the skin. It is metabolized completely in vertebrates {{in a manner similar}} to ethanol: alcohol dehydrogenase converts <b>n-butanol</b> to butyraldehyde; this is then converted to butyric acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Butyric acid can be fully metabolized to carbon dioxide and water by the β-oxidation pathway. In the rat, only 0.03% of an oral dose of 2,000mg/kg was excreted in the urine.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>n-Butanol</b> {{is used as}} an {{ingredient}} in processed and artificial flavourings, and for the extraction of lipid-free protein from egg yolk, natural flavouring materials and vegetable oils, the manufacture of hop extract for beermaking, and as a solvent in removing pigments from moist curd leaf protein concentrate.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>n-Butanol</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a substitute for}} diesel fuel and gasoline. [...] It is produced in small quantities in nearly all fermentations (see fusel oil), but species of Clostridium produce much higher yields of butanol, and research is currently underway to increase the ultimate yield of biobutanol from biomass.|$|E
2500|$|Liquid <b>n-butanol,</b> as {{is common}} with most organic solvents, is {{extremely}} irritating to the eyes; repeated {{contact with the}} skin can also cause irritation.

2500|$|... <b>n-Butanol</b> is of low {{toxicity}} to aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates. It is rapidly biodegraded in water, although an estimated 83% partitions to air {{where it is}} degraded by hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of 1.2–2.3days. It has low potential to bioaccumulate. A potential hazard of significant discharges to watercourses is the rise in chemical oxygen demand (C.O.D.) associated with its biodegradation.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>n-Butanol</b> occurs {{naturally}} {{as a minor}} {{product of}} the fermentation of sugars and other carbohydrates, and is present in many foods and beverages.
