5|$|The {{groups are}} divided {{based on their}} {{alternative}} strategies of parasitizing its host colony (Myrmica ants). The predatory (in which the caterpillar preys on the host ants) and 'cuckoo' (in which the caterpillars feed off of the ants' regurgitation) strategies are derived characteristics from the alcon group, with the predatory strategy having evolved from the teleius group and the cuckoo strategy having evolved from the arion-Phengaris group. Another way these groups are categorized is by {{whether or not they}} release a certain chemical (dorsal <b>nectary</b> organ secretions) {{to attract the attention of}} the host ant. This trait is not as prominent in ancestors of the alcon group and in the M. nausithous, which is part of the teleius group.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches {{full size}} {{about two weeks}} after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they mature and split open, revealing the stigma, style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped <b>nectary</b> lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E
5|$|The book {{describes}} how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which natural theology attributed to a grand designer. By showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the flowers to suit new purposes, Darwin countered the prevailing view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of a Creator. Darwin's painstaking observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as the puzzle of Catasetum, which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant. In addition, they produced testable predictions including his then-controversial proposal that the long <b>nectary</b> of Angraecum sesquipedale meant {{that there must be}} a moth with an equally long proboscis. This was confirmed in 1903 when Xanthopan morganii praedicta was found in Madagascar.|$|E

50|$|Extrafloral <b>nectaries</b> (also {{known as}} extranuptial <b>nectaries)</b> are nectar-secreting plant glands that develop outside {{of flowers and}} are not {{involved}} in pollination. They are highly diverse in form, location, size, and mechanism. They have been described in virtually all above-ground plant parts - including leaves (in which case they are known as foliar <b>nectaries),</b> petioles, stipules, cotyledons, fruits, and stems, among others. They range from single-celled trichomes to complex cup-like structures {{that may or may not}} be vascularized. In contrast to floral <b>nectaries,</b> nectar produced outside the flower generally have a defensive function. The nectar attracts predatory insects which will eat both the nectar and any plant-eating insects around, thus functioning as 'bodyguards'. Foraging predatory insects show a preference for plants with extrafloral <b>nectaries,</b> particularly some species of ants and wasps, which have been observed to directly defend the plants. Among passion flowers, for example, extrafloral <b>nectaries</b> prevent herbivores by attracting ants and deterring two species of butterflies from laying eggs. In many carnivorous plants, extrafloral <b>nectaries</b> are also used to attract insect prey.|$|R

The base of the flower has pale green bracts enclosing a swollen <b>nectary</b> chamber. The floral tube (hypanthium) is 6–8 × 0.7–1cm and pale green, while the sepals and petals are 3–6cm long, pink and perpendicular to the floral tube, or reflexed.

Styles free to almost completely fused. Fruit explosively dehiscent. Seeds usually two per locule; sometimes one in Actephila and Meineckia.|$|E
500|$|The book {{moves on}} to the various foreign orchids Darwin had {{received}} from others. His experiments showed that the [...] "astonishing length" [...] of the 11inch (290mm) long <b>nectary</b> hanging from Angraecum sesquipedale flowers implied {{the need for an}} as yet unknown moth with a proboscis 10–11inches (250–275mm) long to pollinate these flowers in Madagascar. He viewed this as the outcome of a coevolutionary race, writing that [...] "there has been a race in gaining length between the <b>nectary</b> of the Angræcum and the proboscis of certain moths". This wastefulness is familiar in modern terms as the idea of an evolutionary arms race, but was disturbing to biologists of the time who believed that adaptations were the outcome of benevolent divine purpose.|$|E
5|$|Florida International University {{ecologist}} Suzanne Koptur {{reported the}} presence of extrafloral <b>nectaries</b> on F. aurea figs in the Florida Everglades. Extrafloral <b>nectaries</b> are structures which produce nectar but are not associated with flowers.

They attract insects, primarily ants, which defend the <b>nectaries,</b> thus protecting the plant against herbivores.|$|R
50|$|Foliar <b>nectaries</b> {{have also}} been {{observed}} in 39 species of ferns belonging to seven genera and four families of Cyatheales and Polypodiales. They are absent, however, in bryophytes, gymnosperms, early angiosperms, magnoliids, and members of Apiales among the eudicots.

500|$|There was {{considerable}} controversy surrounding Darwin's prediction that a moth {{would be found}} in Madagascar with a long proboscis matching the <b>nectary</b> of Angraecum sesquipedale. An anonymous article in the Edinburgh Review of October 1862 by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, argued that Darwin's wording implied purpose, and concluded that [...] "We know, too, that these purposes and ideas are not our own, but the ideas and purposes of Another." [...] He considered Darwin's explanations the [...] "most unsatisfactory conjectures", and raised obscure metaphysical objections while supporting a kind of creative evolutionism. Emma Darwin thought that although Argyll was [...] "quite opposed" [...] to Darwin's views, [...] "he praises the Orchids in such an enthusiastic way that he will do it a good turn". Darwin was delighted to find that a well written article [...] "smashing" [...] Argyll's review was by one of Darwin's own nephews.|$|E
500|$|Flowering occurs between October and December in {{its native}} range, with plants at higher {{elevations}} flowering later than ones at lower altitude.

Each flower is encased in a [...] long perianth, which is a much brighter red on the surface facing {{the centre of the}} flower than the surface facing outwards. Anthesis, or the opening of the flowers, begins with those at the centre of the flowerhead and moves to the edges or base. The individual flower bears a sessile anther (that is, it lacks a filament), which lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop.

500|$|Argyll {{went on in}} his 1867 book The Reign of Law to cleverly ridicule Darwin's ideas, {{particularly}} the prediction of a moth in Madagascar with a proboscis 10–11inches (250–275mm) long. He believed that adaptations showed divine purpose, not a mindless evolutionary arms race. In his response Creation by Law later that year, Alfred Russel Wallace produced a detailed explanation of how the <b>nectary</b> could have evolved through natural selection, and stated that he had carefully measured moths in the British Museum, finding that the proboscis of [...] Macrosila cluentius from South America was 9inches (235mm) long, and the proboscis of Macrosila morganii from tropical Africa (since renamed [...] Xanthopan morganii) was 7inches (190mm) long. An enquiry raised in 1873 was answered by Darwin's friend Hermann Müller, who stated that his brother Fritz Müller had caught a sphinx moth in Brazil with a proboscis nearly [...] long. Darwin's anticipation was fully met in 1903, when a subspecies of Xanthopan morganii was found in Madagascar with a proboscis about 12inches (300mm) long, and was named Xanthopan morganii praedicta to celebrate this verification of a testable prediction made by Darwin {{on the basis of}} his theory of natural selection.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} chapter Darwin {{described}} the British orchids he had studied, giving detailed explanations of their various mechanisms for transferring pollen to insects.

These pollen masses stand side by side and have stalks down to adhesive balls in a cup which keeps them moist and sticky. When an insect lands on the large projecting lower petal, the labellum, and pushes its head and proboscis into the centre of the flower and down to the <b>nectary,</b> it breaks the cup and the adhesive balls attach the pollen masses to the front of the insect. As the insect flies off, each stalk rotates the pollen mass downwards and forwards so that when the insect lands on another flower the pollen masses attached to the insect pass under the male organ and leave pollen on the female organ, achieving cross fertilisation.

500|$|Flowering occurs from October to January, and {{is related}} to altitude: plants at lower {{elevations}} flower earlier than ones higher up. The flower heads, known as inflorescences, are terminal—that is, they arise {{on the ends of}} small branches—and are surrounded by small inconspicuous hairy bracts. This sets T.truncata apart from all other waratah species, which have hairless bracts. In the shape of a flattened raceme, the flower heads are [...] in diameter and composed of 10 to 35 individual flowers. They are most commonly bright red, though scattered yellow-flowered plants occur. These were described as forma lutea but are mere colour variations and not genetically distinct. Yellow-flowered plants have both red- and yellow-flowered progeny. Anthesis is basipetal; that is, the flowers at the base (edges) of the flower head open first. The flower is composed of a 2cm-long perianth on a 1cm-long stalk, with a pronounced kink in the style above the [...] ovary; all other waratah species have gently incurving styles.
