5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking {{out of the window}} at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I <b>noticed</b> <b>something</b> peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E
5|$|On January 21, 1813, eight city commissioners visited Redheffer {{to inspect}} the machine. They had to do so through a barred window, as Redheffer was {{concerned}} anyone going near the machine might damage it. One of the inspectors, Nathan Sellers, was accompanied by his son Coleman, who <b>noticed</b> <b>something</b> odd about the gears. The machine itself {{was said to be}} powering a separate device through a series of gears and weights. Coleman noticed that the cogs were worn on the wrong side and suggested that the device was in fact powering the machine.|$|E
25|$|When the Abarcas left Iguala {{after the}} mass {{kidnapping}} in September 2014, law enforcement began an investigation to locate all the properties {{owned by the}} couple and their families. Abarca had several properties in Guerrero and in other states, but authorities believed that he was hiding in Mexico City or Monterrey, Nuevo León. After ruling out Monterrey as a possible hideout, authorities concentrated on three properties in Iztapalapa where they believed the couple was hiding. Through the couple's real estate businesses, authorities were also able to link Berumen to the family once more and locate her properties in Iztapalapa. In one of the properties, investigators <b>noticed</b> <b>something</b> unusual: they regularly saw a woman (now known to be Berumen) {{going in and out}} of a property that was thought to be abandoned. Authorities then mounted an investigation and surveillance operation on Berumen before finally entering the property and arresting Abarca and Pineda.|$|E

500|$|Following Blythe's arrest, Tomáš Fiala, a {{promoter}} of the concert, {{said that there}} was no fight between the fan and Blythe, and that [...] "it was an unfortunate incident which happened during the concert when someone climbed onto the stage where he was not supposed to be." [...] According to the Lamb of God publicist Adrenaline PR, [...] " [...] incident deals with a fan that three times during the concert jumped the barricade and rushed Randy during the performance. It is alleged that the third time, security was not able to reach him and that Randy pushed him back into the audience where supposedly he fell and hit his head." [...] However, it was revealed during the trial that it was a different fan who previously got into contact with Blythe than Nosek. Guitarist Willie Adler said, [...] "I can't recall that particular show, let alone a fan being beaten on the stage. I think I would've <b>noticed</b> <b>something</b> like that considering the Dime thing." ...|$|E

[...] Between 1943 and 1956, Matilda {{gave birth to}} 8 of Billy's calves, 6 of which were reared. [...] At {{some point during the}} 1940s, the press started to refer to Billy as William Johnson Hippopotamus. [...] The zoo {{developed}} the tradition of naming all his calves Gumdrop, using Roman numerals to distinguish them. [...] By the birth of Gumdrop XVI, the zoo had <b>noticed</b> <b>something</b> curious: of all Billy's calves, only one was male. [...] Research would later confirm that pygmy hippos in captivity {{are far more likely to}} give birth to females, though not by such an extreme ratio as Billy. [...] Twenty-three years after Coolidge's death (January 5, 1933) Billy himself died on October 11, 1955, five months before the birth of Gumdrop XVIII. [...] "He carried his work on to the end", said a zoo official. [...] Hannah followed Billy in death on March 6, 1958.|$|E

500|$|On 17 September 1950 {{a pair of}} Grumman F9F-2 Panthers {{launched}} from the deck of [...] Philippine Sea. VF-112 Ensign Edward D. Jackson Jr. was leading a section [...] dispatched to strafe an airfield near North Korea's capital, Pyongyang. Flying on his wing was Ensign Dayl E. Crow. The airfield {{turned out to be}} little more than a grass strip littered with burned and shattered Soviet-built war machines. After strafing a locomotive and setting it ablaze, the jets turned north and started down the Han River. Soon, Jackson spotted about 75 river boats. When they starting receiving small arms fire from [...] "passengers" [...] on the vessels, Crow followed Jackson down as they made a low strafing pass, splintering many of the small craft with 20mm cannon fire. After the pass both attackers started to climb from [...] AGL. Jackson then flew through an aerial booby trap: steel cables strung across the Han to [...] "clothesline" [...] low flying planes. The Panther ripped through the cables like twine, but the whipsawing cable strands caught the starboard wing, shredded the wingtip tank and snapped across the canopy, punching out the windscreen and side windows. The impact knocked Jackson unconscious with severe facial injuries. Crow, flying just astern <b>noticed</b> <b>something</b> wrong, then saw the crushed wing tank and shattered canopy, its inner surface misted with blood. After 20 seconds Jackson regained consciousness and found himself blinded by shards of Plexiglas and blood. Crow was able to guide his leader towards the Yellow Sea, but Jackson was fading in and out of consciousness. With only the left flap down due to damage to the right wing the Panther approached the ship {{and with the help of}} LSO Lt.j.g."Les" [...] Bruestle and Crow the blind pilot trapped the #4 wire on the first attempt. Jackson survived with 36 stitches and an emergency blood transfusion.|$|E
500|$|... "Million Dollar Maybe" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a 'B' grade, {{the highest of}} the night. VanDerWerff was polarized with the plot, opining that it was convoluted and stated, [...] "This was a completely stupid plot, but to the show's credit, it commented on this when Homer told Marge he won the lottery and she said she'd much rather have the money than the wedding reception performance he missed." [...] Similarly, VanDerWerff was split with the subplot of [...] "Million Dollar Maybe". In regards to the subplot, he wrote, [...] "The Lisa gets the old people a Wii stand-in plot {{was one of those}} ones where the Simpsons writers have obviously <b>noticed</b> <b>something</b> in pop culture but have yet to wholly grasp what it is or why it's important." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode an 8.1 out of 10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. Canning felt that the episode was impressive, expressing that it was [...] "a fun and funny episode focused on Homer and his always dysfunctional relationship with his family [...] just what we've come to love and expect after 20 years." [...] Jason Hughes of [...] TV Squad gave the episode a more mixed review, praising the episode's humor, but calling it [...] "random". Hughes wrote, [...] "A lot about this episode bothered me, and I think The Simpsons has been having a pretty strong season for the most part." [...] He resumed, [...] "This one just didn't hold together as strongly as most of the prior ones." [...] He went on to criticize the character development of Ricardo, opining that it was a [...] "slap to the face to the winner." [...] He then commented: [...] "Peggy Black created Ricardo Bomba as a new ladies man type of figure, so the writers had him drive into a cliff wall and subsequent fiery explosion right away upon his first appearance. He didn't even get to finish what was, I guess, going to be his catchphrase." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to a 1998 {{article in}} the Auburn Plainsman, the most likely origin of the [...] "War Eagle" [...] cry grew from a 1913 pep rally at Langdon Hall, where {{students}} had gathered {{the day before the}} annual football game against the University of Georgia. [...] Cheerleader Gus Graydon told the crowd, [...] "If we are going to win this game, we'll have {{to get out there and}} fight, because this means war." [...] During the frenzy, another student, E.

2500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} {{were written in}} October 2013, when Gunnulfsen was highly {{inspired}} by ghosts and spirits. These same two items–ghosts and spirits–would {{be incorporated into the}} Gunnulfsen's lyrics. [...] "St. Patrick" [...] was written in the fall of 2013, during a day-off from tour; a demo of it was recorded within two hours. The song is about Gunnulfsen's girlfriend, who helped her during a rough time in her life. Gunnulfsen didn't think the band would record it; she thought it was [...] "too poppy." [...] "My House" [...] is about a poltergeist and is [...] "also a metaphor for a person, being like, 'Go away.'" [...] "Holy", according to Gunnulfsen, is [...] "one of the most personal and honest songs" [...] featured on the album. The song is about a person who had a problem with Gunnulfsen being gay. [...] "White Noise" [...] came about as a spur of the moment idea. Gunnulfsen had previous <b>noticed</b> <b>something</b> on Tumblr about Poltergeist and [...] "I was like, 'Oh! That's perfect". The demo of the song was under the working title [...] "White Boiz" [...] and featured a different drum beat in the chorus. The group replaced this different drum beat with a [...] "half-time, really dragging beat" [...] and experimented with an EBow. [...] "Fire" [...] was written after [...] "a very intense" [...] encounter with a person, resulting in the song coming across as [...] "very raw and real", according to Gunnulfsen.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I <b>noticed</b> <b>something</b> that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
