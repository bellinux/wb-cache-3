40|$|This paper {{explores the}} notion of place in {{relation}} to <b>networked</b> <b>mobility</b> and mobile phone use. Two key arguments are developed. The first is {{that the experience of}} place persists and remains an important consideration in relation to mobile phone use. The ‘domestication’ approach to understanding the development and uses of new technologies is considered useful in explaining this persistence. The second is that <b>networked</b> <b>mobility</b> actually forces a renegotiation of place, and leads to significantly altered understandings of place and place-making. This is theorised as a shift from a traditional understanding of place as stable and fixed (stabilitas loci), to a reconceptualisation of place as experienced in and understood through mobility (mobilitas loci). The paper concludes by sketching some of the potential, and possible implications, that this renewed understanding of place might have for future studies of <b>networked</b> <b>mobility...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{metropolitan}} areas, {{the scale}} and intensity of collaboration is a key determinant {{of whether or not}} polycentric networks function properly. Metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) have given researchers a unique opportunity to study {{the scale and}} intensity of collaboration in these areas. In a study conducted by researchers from the University of Vermont as well as the University of La Verne, using a 2009 Government Accountability Office survey of all 381 MPOs, they found a direct link to the scale of the MPO and the performance seen. The study concluded that higher intensity of collaboration of MPOs across vertical as well as horizontal stakeholders generates a greater sense of good performance. The study found that MPOs who focus more on vertical collaboration (between the federal state and higher up agencies) saw a decrease in their perceived performance. The study looked at 15 indicators to determine its findings, these indicators include: condition of transportation <b>network,</b> <b>mobility</b> for disadvantaged populations, air quality, level of highway congestion, measure of public participation, extent of coordination and stakeholder involvement, satisfaction among general public, satisfaction among local stakeholders, compliance with federal and state rules, transportation systems security, transportation systems accessibility, transportation systems reliability, transportation systems safety, travel demand model accuracy and project implementation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In Public Safety and Disaster Recovery (PSDR) scenarios, {{reliable}} communication is an imperative. Unfortunately, communication infrastructure is often destroyed or overwhelmed by whatever precipitated the scenario (e. g., a hurricane or terrorist attack). Thus, the PSDR workers must often deploy their own communications infrastructure on-site. Wireless mesh networks (WMN) {{have been identified}} as being ideally suited to this task. WMN offer a high-capacity wireless backhaul network, provided by mesh routers, through which clients can connect to one another or with external <b>networks.</b> <b>Mobility</b> of clients within the mesh is particularly important for Public Service and Disaster Recovery scenarios. This creates a challenging problem as clients may move out of range of the mesh router they were using to connect to the mesh and need to associate with another. Client handoff mechanisms provide this functionality. In this paper we provide a critical survey of client handoff approaches applicable to IEEE 802. 11 WMN evaluating them based on the strict QoS requirements established by the US Department of Homeland Security for PSDR networks.

40|$|<b>Network</b> <b>mobility</b> is an {{innovative}} concept for conducting {{a set of}} mobile nodes within a car-based mobile network. With the expanding wireless technology and increasing demands for ubiquitous Internet connectivity, mobile network is becoming more demanding technology. As a result, <b>network</b> <b>mobility</b> basic support protocol has been proposed by the internet engineering task force for the continual worldwide connectivity of each node within the mobile network.

40|$|This paper takes {{point of}} {{departure}} in an understanding of mobility as an important cultural dimension to contemporary life. The movement of objects, signs, and people constitutes material sites of networked relationships. However, as {{an increasing number of}} mobility practices are making up our everyday life experiences the movement {{is much more than a}} travel from point A to point B. The mobile experiences of the contemporary society are practices that are meaningful and normatively embedded. That is to say, mobility is seen as a cultural phenomenon shaping notions of self and other as well as the relationship to sites and places. Furthermore, an increasing number of such mobile practices are mediated by technologies of tangible and less tangible sorts. The claim in this paper is, that by reflecting upon the meaning of mobility in new mediated interaction spaces we come to test and challenge these established dichotomies as less fruitful ways of thinking. The paper concludes with a research agenda for unfolding a “politics of visibility”, engaging with the ambivalences of <b>networked</b> <b>mobilities</b> and mediated projects, and critically challenge of taken for granted interpretations of <b>networked</b> <b>mobilities...</b>|$|R
