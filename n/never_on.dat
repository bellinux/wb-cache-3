5|$|After 2007, Bautista {{never made}} another {{start in the}} major leagues. He began 2008 with the Detroit Tigers bullpen but had an injury and {{was traded to the}} Pittsburgh Pirates during the year. He re-signed with Pittsburgh in 2009 but only {{appeared}} in 14 games, spending most {{of the year in the}} minors. Bautista posted a 3.74 ERA with the San Francisco Giants in 2010 but was <b>never</b> <b>on</b> their playoff roster and was released during the playoffs. In 2011, he signed with the Seattle Mariners but was assigned to the minor leagues. Halfway through the season, he joined the Hanwha Eagles of the Korea Baseball Organization.

5|$|Although Crash! Boom! Bang! saw chart success (No.1 in Sweden, No.2 in Germany & Australia, No.3 in the UK), it sold fewer copies {{than had}} their {{previous}} albums. EMI America {{were reluctant to}} release the album, and instead promoted a shortened 10-track Favorites CD in association with McDonald's. The Favorites of Crash! Boom! Bang! CD reportedly sold about 1 million copies. It was noted by journalists that the McDonald's promotion CD and other CDs by Tina Turner, Garth Brooks and Elton John, led to US music retailers of the time being unhappy with the promotion on several fronts, including that it bypassed established music stores and {{that the price of}} the CD was way below normal wholesale costs. Some stores refused to sell the albums published by EMI, with one major chain protesting by temporarily pulling all products from CEMA (EMI's distribution wing) out of its sales and ad campaigns. Relations with EMI's North American subsidiary, <b>never</b> <b>on</b> the best of terms, collapsed after the release of this album. Crash! Boom! Bang! became the last Roxette release EMI would issue in the US, until Greatest Hits was released in 2011 on subsidiary label Capitol Records.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{emergence}} of the ice trade of the 19th century, snow and ice had been collected and stored to use in the summer months {{in various parts of the}} world, but <b>never</b> <b>on</b> a large scale. In the Mediterranean and in South America, for example, there was a long history of collecting ice from the upper slopes of the Alps and the Andes during the summer months and traders transporting this down into the cities. Similar trading practices had grown up in Mexico during the colonial period. The Russians collected ice along the Neva River during the winter months for consumption in Saint Petersburg for many years. Wealthy Europeans began to build ice houses to store ice gathered on their local estates during the winter from the 16th century onwards; the ice was used to cool drinks or food for the wealthiest elites.|$|E

5|$|In June 2007, Jones {{was traded}} to the Portland Trail Blazers along with the draft rights to Rudy Fernandez, the 24th pick in the 2007 NBA draft, in {{exchange}} for cash considerations. In late January 2008, Jones was leading the NBA in three-point percentage with a percentage slightly over 50%. He missed 12 games from February 4 to February 27 with a knee injury. He had also missed 12 games in November 2007 due to knee problems, spending five games on the inactive list and seven as a DNP-CD. Jones finished the 2007–08 season third in the league in three-point percentage with a percentage of 44.4%. Despite his good shooting for the year, he was not selected to participate in the Three-Point Shootout contest during the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, much to the chagrin of Trail Blazers fans. He played in 58 games, starting 3, during the season while averaging 8.0 points, 2.8 rebounds and 22.0 minutes per game. The Trail Blazers finished the 2007–08 season with a 41–41 record. That season was the only time in Jones's NBA career that he missed the playoffs. He was also <b>never</b> <b>on</b> a team with a losing record. On June 26, 2008, he used his player option to opt out of his contract with the Trail Blazers, making him a free agent for the off-season.|$|E
