40|$|The {{power source}} of an {{underwater}} vehicle {{is the main}} component that determines its range of travel and the tasks that it can perform. Until recently, the choice of practical power sources for most applications has been limited to lead?acid and silver?zinc batteries are a well-established technology and are available at low cost. However, they have a low energy density (~ 25 Wh kg - 1). Although silver?zinc batteries have a high energy density (~ 120 Wh kg - 1), they are very expensive, costing 20 times the price of lead?acid. They also have a very short life of 40 ? 1 [...] cycles compared with 1000 cycles for lead?acid [1]. In recent years considerable research and development {{work has been done}} on advanced power sources for road electric and hybrid vehicles. This ongoing work is motivated by environmentally driven legislation aiming at reducing the harmful emissions of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (e. g. [2, 41]). The power source should ideally have a high energy density, high power density (higher charge and discharge rates), low cost, long life, low maintenance, high efficiency and wide operating-temperature range. It should also be safe and recyclable. In addition to these requirements, which are similar to those for a road vehicle, there are additional considerations imposed by working in the underwater environment. Ideally, the power source should be <b>non-gassing</b> and, in the case of batteries, the electrolyte should be spill-proof. the operation of the power source should be independent of depth. This paper presents a review of the features of different types of batteries (primary and secondary) and fuel cells that have been used in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), highlighting their merits and operational and engineering issues that need to be considered when using them. It also presents a survey of potentially promising alternative types of batteries and energy-storage systems including flywheel electromechanical batteries and supercapacitors...|$|E
40|$|A {{multistage}} electrophoresis apparatus {{has been}} invented {{for use in}} the separation of cells, protein molecules, and other particles and solutes in concentrated aqueous solutions and suspensions. The design exploits free electrophoresis but overcomes the deficiencies of prior free-electrophoretic separators by incorporating a combination of published advances in mathematical modeling of convection, sedimentation, electro-osmotic flow, and the sedimentation and aggregation of droplets. In comparison with other electrophoretic separators, these apparatuses are easier to use and are better suited to separation in relatively large quantities characterized in the art as preparative (in contradistinction to smaller quantities characterized in the art as analytical). In a multistage electrophoretic separator according to the invention, an applied vertical steady electric field draws the electrically charged particles of interest from within a cuvette to within a collection cavity that has been moved into position of the cuvette. There are multiple collection cavities arranged in a circle; each is aligned with the cuvette for a prescribed short time. The multistage, short-migration-path character of the invention solves, possibly for the first time, the fluid-instability problems associated with free electrophoresis. The figure shows a prototype multistage electrophoretic separator that includes four sample stations and five collection stages per sample. At each sample station, an aqueous solution or suspension containing charged species to be separated is loaded into a cuvette, which is machined into a top plate. The apparatus includes a lower plate, into which 20 collection cavities have been milled. Each cavity is filled with an electrophoresis buffer solution. For the collection of an electrophoretic fraction, the lower plate is rotated to move a designated collection cavity into alignment {{with the opening of the}} cuvette. An electric field is then applied between a <b>non-gassing</b> electrode in the collection cavity and an electrolyte compartment, which is separated from the cuvette by a semipermeable membrane. The electrolyte is refreshed by circulation by use of a peristaltic pump. In subsequent steps, the lower plate is rotated to collect other electrophoretic fractions. Later, the collected fractions are removed from the collection cavities through ports that have threaded plugs. The base of the apparatus contains power supplies and a computer interface. The design includes provisions for monitoring and feedback control of cavity position, electric field, and temperature. The operation of the apparatus can easily be automated, as demonstrated by use of software that has already been written for this purpose...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. An electrochemical technique has been developed {{for the production of}} precursors to ceramic films on hydrogen sorbing metal substrates. It involves the electrolysis of aqueous metal salt solutions which yields hydrogen at the cathode, resulting in local generation of base (hydroxide ions) around this electrode. Such conditions promote the precipitation of metallic hydroxides from a suitable electrolyte. If the local alkaline environment is not disrupted by convective or other forces, then a solid phase accumulates near the cathode, and forms an adherent gel-like structure on its surface. In order to maintain deposition, it is essential that gaseous hydrogen evolution is minimised, and preferably eliminated. This can be achieved by use of a hydrogen sorbing cathode material, such as palladium. The electrode, and adherent film (or, in appropriate circumstances, the deposit alone) can then undergo a subsequent calcination treatment to yield the ceramic layer. It is possible to generate both porous and compact structures by this method, depending on the potential programme employed during deposition. Research has been conducted into the understanding of mechanisms involved in porosity control of films deposited during different potential regimes, with view to establishing routes to layers of predetermined physical structure. In-situ optical methods were employed to complement the electrochemical techniques, providing valuable insight into the initial mechanisms of film formation and the subsequent thickening processes. The utility of the precipitation process was illustrated by the fabrication of films which demonstrated a variable conductivity over a range of humidities appropriate to sensing application. Investigation into the use of a bipolar palladium electrode as an aid to generating thick film deposits was carried out. The device comprised a palladium plate, operated as a bipolar electrode in aqueous electrolyte. Under suitable conditions, the negative face of this electrode can be made to generate and absorb hydrogen, whilst simultaneously, the positive face oxidises hydrogen transported across the bipolar substrate by diffusion. Thus the cathode face is a <b>non-gassing</b> electrode on which thick deposits of metal hydroxide can be grown. This line of research lead to the realisation of a self-feeding hydrogen anode at the electrode's positive face. Further research was undertaken to assess the electrochemical properties of this anode. The effective operating window for hydrogen oxidation was investigated, and the effect of prolonged potential cycling, elevated temperature and bipolar plate thickness on this region was also considered...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{pyrotechnic}} {{time delays}} {{are based on}} powder mixtures pressed into tubes of precise lengths. Pyrotechnics based on filled polymer systems may offer some advantages. This includes continuous manufacture via extrusion processes. Thermoplastic-based pyrotechnic compositions can be formulated by filling conventional polymer matrices with oxidants such as potassium nitrate. More interesting are fluoropolymer matrices as these strong oxidants enable the design of <b>non-gassing</b> systems with suitable fuels. The presence of fillers dramatically increases the melt viscosity. The random packed limit for monodisperse spherical particles corresponds to a volume fraction of 0. 637 (Krieger, 1959). Pyrotechnic compositions with oxidant filler volume fractions below this critical level are only viable for conventional polymers with very high C:H atomic ratios, e. g. polystyrene. Pyrotechnic compositions comprising of filled thermoplastics were simulated using EKVI thermodynamic software. This allowed for the calculation of the adiabatic flame temperatures, variation of the product composition and gas evolved with varied filler content. The EKVI thermodynamic simulations showed that polystyrene filled with potassium nitrate or potassium permanganate were unlikely to be viable as global maximum temperatures were not achieved below 78 vol. %. A fully fluorinated polymer filled with aluminium, magnesium, magnalium and calcium carbide were shown to be viable between 20 wt. % and 70 wt. % reducing agent. Co-polymers of tetrafluoroethylene and vinylidene fluoride filled with aluminium or magnesium showed similar adiabatic temperatures as compositions based on perfluorinated polymers with the same reducing agents. The energy required to decompose the thermoplastic binder would, however, lower {{the amount of energy}} available for the pyrotechnic reaction. Open flame burn test showed that the polystyrene-based compositions did not generate enough energy to decompose the thermoplastic fraction to sustain chemical reaction. Viton B filled with calcium carbide could not sustain burning. Compositions using aluminium and magnalium with Viton B as oxidant sustained burning over the range 20 wt. % to 60 wt. %. The effect of morphology was tested by using two grades of aluminium; atomized aluminium, and flake-like aluminium particles. Energy measurements of Viton B filled with aluminium and magnalium indicated that the maximum energy output occurred in the range 30 wt. % to 40 wt. % fuel for aluminium-based compositions and between 40 wt. % and 50 wt. % for magnalium-based compositions. A maximum burn rate of 82 mm s 1 was achieved using a magnalium/Viton B composition. Friction and impact test showed that the compositions are insensitive. XRD analysis of the combustion residue of Viton B-based compositions using aluminium as fuel showed that the most abundant products formed were Al 4 C 3, AlF 3, carbon and an amorphous phase. An elemental balance indicated that the amorphous phase consisted of carbon, aluminium and fluorine. The XRD spectra of the residues of magnalium-based compositions had unidentified reflections. Quantitative XRD was, therefore, not possible on the reaction products of the magnalium-based compositions. TGA analysis on the combustion residue indicated that the combustion residue contained unreacted reagents. Scanning electron microscopy of the reaction residue revealed the presence of agglomerated cubic particles. EDX analysis indicated that the cubic particles consisted of aluminium and fluorine.

40|$|Most health studies {{measuring}} indoor {{nitrogen dioxide}} (NO 2) concentrations have utilised long-term passive monitors.

Both peak and average NO 2 levels were measured simultaneously in the kitchens of 53 homes using passive sampling techniques. All homes were non-smoking and sampling was conducted in the summer months. Geometric mean (95 % confidence interval (CI)) average NO 2 concentrations for all homes were 16. 2 μg m- 3 (12. 7 - 20. 6 μg m- 3). There was no difference between homes with and without gas cookers (p= 0. 40). Geometric mean (95 %CI) peak NO 2 concentrations were 45. 3 μg m- 3 (36. 0 - 57. 1 μg m- 3). Unlike average concentrations, peak concentrations were significantly higher in homes with gas cookers (64. 0 μg m- 3, 48. 5 - 82. 0 μg m- 3) compared to <b>non-gas</b> homes (25. 1 μg m- 3, 18. 3 - 35. 5 μg m- 3) (p< 0. 001).

Beta-hemolytic streptococci (β-HS) are a {{frequent}} etiological agent, while swab culture from the throat and palatine tonsils is {{the gold standard for}} diagnosis. Objectives. The evaluation of the prevalence of potentially pathogenic β-HS carriage in young adult inhabitants of Wielkopolska. Material and methods. The study included 205 healthy young adult (18 – 44 years old) (29. 0 ± 6. 4) inhabitants (M – 95, F – 110) of Wielkopolska (Poland). Two swabs were taken from the throat: the first one was used to perform a rapid antigenic diagnostic test (RAD T) for group A streptococci (GAS) and the second to grow a conventional culture. If β-HS grew, isolates were serotyped according to Lancefield. In addition, simple demographic and medical data were collected from the subjects. The study was financed from funds granted within the first edition of the “Give a hand” project (Karol Marcinkowski Poznan University of Medical Sciences). Results. Positive throat cultures were obtained in 15. 6 % out of 205 persons (n = 32). The distribution of β-HS serogroup results was as follows: group C (GCS) – 17 cases (53. 1 % of cases where β-HS was positive), group F (GFS) – 9 cases (28. 1 %), GAS – 3 people (9. 4 %) and group G (GGS) – 3 subjects (9. 4 %). The growth of the discussed bacteria in cultures was moderate or high in 53 % of these cases. RAD T was positive in 5 cases (but only one person had GAS in throat culture).

40|$|Background: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus; GAS) is an {{etiological}} {{agent for}} pharyngitis, pyoderma, and invasive infections in humans. Pharyngitis and pyoderma {{may lead to}} serious immune sequelae such as rheumatic heart disease and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). Streptococcal Inhibitor of Complement (SIC) and its orthologue, distantly related to SIC (DRS), are virulence factors expressed by only four of more than 100 M types of GAS. These four types (M 1, M 57, M 12 and M 55) are among the M types, which are associated with PSGN. In several populations PSGN {{has been shown to}} be a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Previous studies showed SIC or DRS antibody-prevalence was associated with PSGN, and seroprevalence of SIC antibodies is significantly high among CKD and ESRD patients in Mumbai. Methods: Streptococcal isolates recovered from GAS pyoderma cases were typed. Seropositivity for SIC and DRS antibodies in subjects with pyoderma, PSGN pediatric cases, age matched healthy controls and <b>non-GAS</b> pyoderma cases were determined. Results: We confirm in this study an association between seroprevalence to SIC and DRS antibodies, and PSGN in Mumbai population despite low point prevalence of M 1, M 12, M 55 and M 57. In addition we extended the study to GAS-pyoderma and <b>non-GAS</b> pyoderma cases. To our surprise, we found a positive association between the seroprevalence to SIC and DRS antibodies, and GAS-pyoderma owing to infection with diverse M types. The mechanism of increased predisposition to pyoderma owing to infection by diverse GAS among SIC or DRS antibody-positive population is not clear. Nonetheless, our findings could be explained by a phenomenon akin to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Conclusions: This is the first report showing a small number of GAS M types conferring predisposition to pyoderma by diverse types. Implications of this ADE-like phenomenon are discussed in the light of evolutionary advantage to GAS, vaccine design and control of renal diseases. Full Tex...|$|R

Results obtained thus far show that gas sparging has increased the permeate flux between 1. 37 and 146. 34 compared to <b>non-gas</b> sparged conditions. In terms of permeate quality, the reductions achieved for suspended solids, total solids, COD, BOD, total nitrogen and ammoniacal nitrogen were 83, 95, 67, 77, 51, 74, respectively, for the gas-sparged condition. Under non gas-sparging conditions, reductions achieved for suspended solids, total solids, COD, BOD, total nitrogen and ammoniacal nitrogen were 92, 96, 67, 72, 60, 75, respectively...|$|R
30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this is the first report of {{abdominal}} wall-lifting laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a patient with hereditary angioedema. Laparoscopic gallbladder surgery, with pneumoperitoneum using carbon dioxide can be performed using spinal or epidural anesthesia [7 – 9]. However, radiating pain to the right shoulder, caused by the stimulation of the diaphragm by pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide or patient anxiety, is a risk factor for transitioning to general anesthesia [7 – 10]. Referred pain caused by pneumoperitoneum may be induced by irritation of the phrenic nerve originating from the third to the fifth cervical nerves [13] and peritoneum innervated by the third to the sixth thoracic nerves [14 – 16], suggesting that analgesia level up to the cervical region is required to eliminate it. In the present case, single-hole Nishii-type lifting laparoscopic surgery was performed without pneumoperitoneum [11, 12] and did not involve carbon dioxide; therefore, the greatest cause for conversion to general anesthesia was avoided. Moreover, <b>non-gas</b> laparoscopic cholecystectomy may require a lower level of anesthesia than cholecystectomy with pneumoperitoneum. The lower level of spinal-epidural anesthesia may contribute to reducing the risk for respiratory depression and avoidance of conversion to general anesthesia.|$|R
40|$|An oxidizer-swirled coaxial element {{injector}} {{is being}} investigated for application in the Space Transportation Main Engine (STME). Single element cold flow experiments were conducted to provide characterization of the STME injector element for future analysis, design, and optimization. All tests were conducted to quiescent, ambient backpressure conditions. Spray angle, circumferential spray uniformity, dropsize, and dropsize distribution were measured in water-only and water/nitrogen flows. Rupe mixing efficiency was measured using water/sucrose solution flows with a large grid patternator for simple comparative evaluation of mixing. Factorial designs of experiment were used for statistical evaluation of injector geometrical design features and propellant flow conditions on mixing and atomization. Increasing the free swirl angle of the liquid oxidizer had the greatest influence on increasing the mixing efficiency. The addition of gas assistance had the most significant effect on reducing oxidizer droplet size parameters and increasing droplet size distribution. Increasing the oxidizer injection velocity had the greatest influence for reducing oxidizer droplet size parameters and increasing size distribution for <b>non-gas</b> assisted flows. Single element and multi-element subscale hot fire testing are recommended to verify optimized designs before committing to the STME design...|$|R
40|$|In the UK {{sector of}} the Southern North Sea, the Triassic Bunter Sandstone Formation (BSF) is {{perceived}} as having a significant potential for the storage of anthropogenic CO 2 within major structural closures. Although most of these structures are saline water-bearing, eight gas fields with BSF reservoirs have been discovered to date. The presence of natural gas fields demonstrates the capability of the various top seals to effectively seal significant gas accumulations over geological time-scales. However, during {{the formation of the}} domes, the BSF and its overlying top seals were subjected to extensional stresses and are therefore commonly transected by faults. The seismically resolvable structure of the BSF-reservoired gas fields are considered here, in order to assess the relationship between faulting and pre-production gas/water contacts. The assessment concludes that at least four of the fields have been affected by crestal faults which do not appear to have affected the sealing ability of the overlying top seals. Therefore, similar minor-offset faults occurring within the <b>non-gas</b> bearing structures may be capable of supporting CO 2 columns that would exert pressures comparable to those exerted by the pre-production gas columns in the fields...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} rigid contact lens base curve radius changes on tear pump {{efficiency}} {{were determined by}} measuring oxygen uptake on six with-the-rule corneas (with toricities between 0. 37 and 1. 00 D) under three conditions: (1) normal open eye, (2) after 5 min of static (without blinking) wear of polymethyl methacrylate (<b>non-gas</b> permeable) contact lenses, and (3) after 5 min of dynamic (with blinking once every 5 s) wear of the same lenses. The difference between the oxygen uptake rates measured under static and dynamic conditions provides an index of tear pump efficiency. Each subject wore a series of five lenses: fitted on K and 0. 05 or 0. 10 mm steeper and flatter than the flattest corneal meridian. The overall diameter of all lenses was 8. 8 mm, the optic zone was 7. 4 mm, the axial edge lift was 0. 09 mm, and all other parameters were constant. The contact lens fitted on K {{was associated with the}} greatest central corneal oxygen debt under static conditions, whereas the same lens also provided for the best tear exchange with the blink. In addition, better tear exchange was found to be associated with larger palpebral aperture sizes...|$|R
30|$|The size of pores and throats {{is at the}} {{nanometer}} scale in tight oil and shale gas zones, and the resistivity of these reservoirs is very high, so the reservoirs show more dielectric properties than conductivity properties. The conductive and dielectric characteristics of a parallel plate capacitor full of fresh water, NaCl solutions, and solid dielectrics, for example, sands are investigated in this paper, and the capacitance data of the <b>non-gas</b> capacitor are measured at different salinities and frequencies by a spectrum analyzer. The experimental results illustrate that the capacitance {{of this kind of}} capacitor is directly proportional to the salinity of the solutions and inversely proportional to the measuring frequency, the same as a vacuum parallel plate capacitor. The remarkable phenomenon, however, is that the capacitance is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two plates. The specific characteristic of this capacitor is different from the conventional parallel plate capacitor. In order to explain this phenomenon, the paper proposed a new concept, named “single micro ion capacitor”, and established a novel model to describe the characteristics of this particular capacitor. Based on this new model, the theoretical capacitance value of the single micro ion capacitor is calculated, and its polarization and relaxation mechanisms are analyzed.|$|R
