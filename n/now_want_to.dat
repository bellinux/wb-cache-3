25|$|A new {{characteristic}} of the modern aspects of the third quest has been the role of archaeology; James Charlesworth states that few modern scholars <b>now</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> overlook the archaeological discoveries that clarify the nature of life in Galilee and Judea {{during the time of}} Jesus. A further {{characteristic of}} the third quest has been its interdisciplinary and global nature of the scholarship. While the first two quests were mostly carried out by European Protestant theologians, the third quest has seen a worldwide influx of scholars from multiple disciplines.|$|E

He said upon his arrival: [...] "I am an ambitious player. I have fought for this opportunity and <b>now</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> show my worth". However, three years later and with only 18 competitive appearances to his credit, also being loaned to fellow league side Vitória de Guimarães, he was released.|$|E

Quality assurance will instead be ensured by our own internal testing department." [...] In an interview with Planet of Games, Brändle further explained, [...] "we do not have the resources to filter and sort all of the anticipated feedback from a beta test. We are currently concentrating exclusively on completion of the product." ...|$|E

2500|$|Campese was {{involved}} in the biggest controversy of the World Cup Final in the 69th minute. English flanker Peter Winterbottom attempted a pass to Campese's opposing winger Rory Underwood, who at that stage [...] "may have had an overlap," [...] when Campese knocked the ball forward. The referee ruled it a deliberate knock-on and awarded England a penalty." [...] The English hooker, Brian Moore, thought the referee should have awarded a penalty try. Moore was reported after the Test to have said, [...] " [...] sets himself up as the saviour of rugby. Yet {{when it comes down to}} it he's as cynical as anyone. I wouldn't criticise Campese except he called me mad as a hatter earlier this week." [...] Moore writes in Beware of the Dog: Rugby's Hard Man Reveals All that, ‘I have no issue with what Campese did; I would have done the same, and he got away with it. The point I make about what he did is that, as he has been shown to be as cynical as the rest of us, I don’t <b>now</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hear lectures from him about the spirit of the game.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Creators of Gorillaz, {{musician}} Damon Albarn {{and artist}} Jamie Hewlett, {{began working on}} a new Gorillaz project in November 2007 called Carousel, which evolved into Plastic Beach, the group's third studio album. In the November 2007 issue of Q, when asked what his top priority for 2008 was, Damon Albarn replied [...] "Well, I'm doing the next Gorillaz thing, but it won't be called Gorillaz." [...] In the February 2008 Gorillaz-Unofficial interview, Jamie Hewlett elaborated on this, saying [...] "I think the idea behind it is that it's like how The Who presented their movies– Tommy and Quadrophenia and so on. Those were presented as by 'The Who' even though none {{of the members of the}} band were in the movies. I don't think anyone from The Who was in Quadrophenia. But it's the same people working on it, that's the principle." [...] In a July 2008 interview with The Observer he also said, [...] "Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters any more— it's more like an organisation of people doing new projects. [...] That's my ideal model— Gorillaz is a group of people who gave you this, and <b>now</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> give you new stuff." ...|$|E

The question now is one of exchange value, [...] that is, for how much of other commodities a given commodity will [...] exchange. The reasons for the trade are supposed to exist; but we [...] <b>now</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know what the law is which determines the proportions [...] of the exchange.

I don't believe you can guess, and so I might as well tell you at once. As the lawyer says, it was done in the manner following, to wit: After I had delayed the matter as long as I thought I could in honour do (which, by the way, had brought me round into the last fall), I concluded I might as well bring it to a consummation without further delay, and so I mustered my resolution and made the proposal to her direct; but, shocking to relate, she answered, No. At first I supposed she did it through an affectation of modesty, which I thought but ill became her under the peculiar circumstances of the case, but on my renewal of the charge I found she repelled it with greater firmness than before. I tried it again and again, but with the same success, or rather with the same want of success.|$|E

On my way up in a coasting craft to rejoin, I was wrecked on the Peruvian coast and made prisoner. I escaped by the aid of friends, and finding it impossible to make my way down to Chili, I crossed the Andes and came down by the great rivers to Para. There I heard that Lord Cochrane was about to assume the command of the Brazilian fleet.

Never in their lives had they really talked to each other clearly and honestly about anything. Indeed it is scarcely too much to say that neither had ever talked about anything to anyone. She was too young, her mind was now growing up in her and feeling its way to conscious expression, and he had never before wanted to express himself. He did <b>now</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> express himself. For behind his rant and fury Sir Isaac had been thinking very hard indeed during the last three weeks about his life and her life and their relations; he had never thought so much about anything except his business economics. So far he had either joked at her, talked [...] "silly" [...] to her, made, as they say, [...] "remarks," [...] or vociferated. That had been the sum of their mental intercourse, as indeed it is the sum of the intercourse of most married couples. His attempt to state his case to her had so far always flared into rhetorical outbreaks. But he was discontented with these rhetorical outbreaks. His dispositions to fall into them made him rather like a nervous sepia that cannot keep its ink sac quiet while it is sitting for its portrait. In the earnestness of his attempt at self-display he vanished in his own outpourings.|$|E
