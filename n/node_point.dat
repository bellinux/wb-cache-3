50|$|In {{the finite}} element method, the {{behavior}} (stresses, strains and displacements resulting from load conditions) of large-scale structures is approximated by a FE model consisting of structural elements (members) connected at structural node points. Calculations on traditional computers are performed at each <b>node</b> <b>point</b> and results communicated to adjacent node points until {{the behavior of}} the entire structure is computed. On the Finite Element Machine, microprocessors located at each <b>node</b> <b>point</b> perform these nodal computations in parallel. If there are more node points (N) than microprocessors (P), then each microprocessor performs N/P computations. The Finite Element Machine contained 32 processor boards each with a Texas Instruments TMS9900 processor, 32 Input/Output (IO) boards and a TMS99/4 controller. The FEM was conceived, designed and fabricated at NASA Langley Research Center. The TI 9900 processor chip was selected by the NASA team as it was the first 16-bit processor available on the market which until then was limited to less powerful 8-bit processors. The FEM concept was first successfully tested to solve beam bending equations on a Langley FEM prototype (4 IMSAI 8080s). This led to full-scale FEM fabrication & testing by the FEM hardware-software-applications team led by Dr. Olaf Storaasli formerly of NASA Langley Research Center and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (currently at USEC).The first significant Finite Element Machine results are documented in: The Finite Element Machine: An experiment in parallel processing (NASA TM 84514).|$|E

5000|$|A less {{accurate}} {{method of}} determining wavelength with a tube, used before Kundt, {{is simply to}} measure {{the length of the}} tube at resonance, which is approximately equal to a multiple of a half wavelength.

[...] Because the air at the source end of the tube, next to the speaker's diaphragm, is vibrating, it is not exactly at a <b>node</b> (<b>point</b> of zero amplitude) of the standing wave.

50|$|Another {{reason for}} using the fork shape is that, when it vibrates in its {{principal}} mode, the handle vibrates {{up and down as}} the prongs move apart and together. There is a <b>node</b> (<b>point</b> of no vibration) at the base of each prong. The handle motion is small, allowing the fork to be held by the handle without damping the vibration, but it allows the handle to transmit the vibration to a resonator, which amplifies the sound of the fork. The fork is usually struck, and then the handle is pressed against a wooden box resonator, or a table top. Without the resonator the sound of a tuning fork is very faint. The {{reason for this is that}} the sound waves produced by each fork prong are 180° out of phase with the other, so at a distance from the fork they interfere and largely cancel each other out. If a sound absorbing sheet is slid in between the prongs of a vibrating fork, reducing the waves reaching the ear from one prong, the volume heard will actually increase, due to a reduction of this cancellation.|$|E

A series of static racket impacts and a {{polynomial}} fit were used to simulate four different racket shots with increasing amounts of angular velocity—identifying the true ‘power point’ for each shot.

Comparing theory with experiment revealed that the ‘ideal point’ is most accurate for impacts around the racket’s <b>node</b> <b>point</b> (the rigid body model does not account for frame vibration). Previous research has shown that tennis players aim to strike the <b>node</b> <b>point</b> of the racket.
