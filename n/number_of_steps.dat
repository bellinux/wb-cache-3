5|$|Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor {{published}} {{a series of}} six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only {{if they could be}} constructed in a finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole. Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period.|$|E
5|$|One inefficient {{approach}} {{to finding the}} GCD of two natural numbers a and b is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number b. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> of this approach grows linearly with b, or exponentially {{in the number of}} digits. Another inefficient approach is to find the prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted above, the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers a and b. Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.|$|E

For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b is {{greater than or equal to}} F'N+1 which in turn is greater than or equal to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E

Therefore, the government was criticized by the Latvian press for being unable to ensure public safety and freedom of speech. The unapproved events took place despite the ban.

5|$|The {{computational}} {{efficiency of}} Euclid's algorithm {{has been studied}} thoroughly. This efficiency can be described {{by the number of}} division steps the algorithm requires, multiplied by the computational expense of each step. The first known analysis of Euclid's algorithm is due to A. A. L. Reynaud in 1811, who showed that the number of division steps on input (u, v) is bounded by v; later he improved this to v/2 +2. Later, in 1841, P. J. E. Finck showed that the number of division steps is at most 2log2v+1, and hence Euclid's algorithm runs in time polynomial {{in the size of the}} input. Émile Léger, in 1837, studied the worst case, which is when the inputs are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Finck's analysis was refined by Gabriel Lamé in 1844, who showed that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> required for completion is never more than five times the number h of base-10 digits of the smaller numberb.|$|E

An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers above. The function f can be {{the magnitude of the}} number, or the degree of a polynomial. The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces f inexorably; hence, if f can be reduced only a finite number of times, the algorithm must stop in a finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>steps.</b> This principle relies heavily on the natural well-ordering of the non-negative integers; roughly speaking, this requires that every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a smallest member.|$|E
