40|$|Abnormalities {{that appear}} during the {{development}} of the dermal, chondral and visceral cranium of the Australian lungfish, <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri,</b> are common and many of these anomalies are reflected in the skulls of fossil lungfish. In addition to asymmetry of individual bones, elements may be missing altogether, or may have fused with one or more adjacent bones. Bones may be divided, with the separate bones having the outline of a normal bone. Elements may be malformed, and sometimes additional elements are present alongside a normal structure. Ossicles of the infraorbital, mandibular and preopercular series vary both in shape and in number. Aberrations may be genetic or teratogenic in origin, or may result from inappropriate osteogenic stimuli from the sensory lines that appear before the bones. The incidence of abnormalities is low in the Recent lungfish, <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri,</b> and anomalies appear early in development and persist throughout life. Fossil dipnoans appear to have a high incidence of similar aberrations. Abnormalities have implications for taxonomic determinations, and phylogenetic analyses that rely on precise patterns of fusion and loss in the skull roofing bones of dipnoans should be treated with caution. Similar constraints apply to attempts to relate the skull roofing bones of dipnoans to those of other vertebrates...|$|R

40|$|The {{recognition}} of phylogenetic information for evaluating conservation priorities has {{stressed the importance}} of basal taxa. The ''Evolutionary Distinctiveness'' index (ED) is a species-specific index that includes branch length expressed as an absolute value measured in millions of years that can be applied to a single terminal taxon in a phylogeny. The ED depends on the tree pattern, i. e. of a cladogram included into a time-scale. When calculated for the Australian lungfish (<b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri),</b> a threatened dipnoan that occurs naturally only in southeast Queensland, the ED index shows variable value according to the chosen tree. On the basis of a recently proposed phylogeny including a new fossil find from the Early Cretaceous of Thailand, the ED value reaches the highest value for piscine sarcopterygians, and for all vertebrates, and thus reinforces the ''originality'' of this fish. This example points out the importance of fossils in the resolution of phylogenies and beyond, in the calculation of indexes supporting conservation decisions. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The {{connective}} tissue that links {{the bones of}} the mandible in the Australian lungfish, <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri,</b> has been described as an intermandibular cartilage, and as such has been considered important for phylogenetic analyses among lower vertebrates. However, light and electron microscopy of developing lungfish jaws demonstrates that the intermandibular tissue, like the {{connective tissue}} that links {{the bones of the}} upper jaw, contains fibroblasts and numerous bundles of collagen fibrils, extending from the trabeculae of the bones supporting the tooth plates. It differs significantly in structure and in staining reactions from the cartilage and the bone found in this species. In common with the cladistian Polypterus and with actinopterygians and some amphibians, lungfish have no intermandibular cartilage.

40|$|Abstract Background One of the {{greatest}} challenges facing the early land vertebrates was the need to effectively interpret a terrestrial environment. Interpretation was based on ocular adaptations evolved for an aquatic environment millions of years earlier. The Australian lungfish <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri</b> is thought to be the closest living relative to the first terrestrial vertebrate, and yet nothing is known about the visual pigments present in lungfish or the early tetrapods. Results Here we identify and characterise five visual pigments (rh 1, rh 2, lws, sws 1 and s ws 2) expressed in the retina of N. forsteri. Phylogenetic analysis of the molecular evolution of lungfish and other vertebrate visual pigment genes indicates a closer relationship between lungfish and amphibian pigments than to pigments in teleost fishes. However, the relationship between lungfish, the coelacanth and tetrapods could not be absolutely determined from opsin phylogeny, supporting an unresolved trichotomy between the three groups. Conclusion The presence of four cone pigments in Australian lungfish suggests that the earliest tetrapods would have had a colorful view of their terrestrial environment. </p...|$|R
40|$|Comparison of the {{ultrastructure}} of the hyaline {{tissue of}} conodont elements and the enamel of vertebrates provides little {{support for a}} close phylogenetic relationship between conodonts and vertebrates. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy shows that the mineralised component of the hyaline tissue of Panderodus and of Cordylodus elements consists of large, flat, oblong crystals, arranged in layers that run parallel to the long axis of the conodont. Enamel in the dentition of a living vertebrate, the lungfish <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri,</b> has crystals of calcium hydroxyapatite, arranged in layers, and extending in groups from the dentine-enamel junction; the crystals are slender, elongate spicules perpendicular {{to the surface of}} the tooth plate, Similar crystal arrangements to those of lungfish are found in other vertebrates, but none resembles the organisation of the hyaline tissue of conodont elements, The crystals of hydroxyapatite in conodont hyaline tissue are exceptionally large, perpendicular or parallel {{to the surface of the}} element, with no trace of prisms, unlike the protoprismatic radial crystallite enamel of fish teeth and scales, or the highly organised prismatic enamel of mammals...|$|R
40|$|Eggs of the polystome monogenean, Concinnocotyla australensis, {{were found}} {{attached}} to the crushing surface and sides of the tooth plates of the Australian lungfish, <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri,</b> from the Brisbane River and Enoggera Creek in south-east Queensland, Australia. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that the crushing surface of the tooth plates of infected hosts can bear an extensive, carpet-like cover comprising enormous numbers of eggs. The eggs are attached firmly by eggshell material at the distal tip of the abopercular appendage. Our {{studies suggest that the}} eggs are laid singly soon after manufacture, embryonate while {{attached to the}} tooth plates, and hatch in situ to release an unciliated oncomiracidium. Attachment of eggs to the host by C. australensis, a rare strategy among monogeneans, achieves some of the advantages, and avoids some of the disadvantages, of ovoviviparity and full egg-embryonation before laying. Emergence of unciliated oncomiracidia permits auto-infection. However, a transfer of larvae or adults from host to host might occur, possibly during spawning, when male and female lungfish intertwine. Attachment of eggs to the tooth plates may reflect the suitability of their hard, non-secretory surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the retina}} of the Australian lungfish <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri</b> was investigated {{by means of}} light- and electron microscopy, whilst immunocytochemical studies were performed to determine the cellular distributions of the major amino acid neurotransmitters and other amino acids.

Labelling was abundant in amacrine cells, whilst GABA was also present in one layer of horizontal cells and some bipolar cells. Taurine was present in both rods and cones, but, unlike the mammalian or avian retina, was absent from other cellular structures, including glial elements. Unexpectedly, the photoreceptor terminals lacked an apparent content of the excitatory amino acid transmitter glutamate. The glutamate that was present in the rods and cones occupied a crescentic arc corresponding to the location of glycogen-rich paraboloids.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The {{development}} of the pineal, pituitary and thyroid glands of the ex-tant lungfish, <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri,</b> are being studied both morphologically and functionally. This paper presents data from hatching to 40 - 52 weeks for a stan-dardised series of lungfish, bred at Macquarie University. At hatching, the pineal comprises a single organ attached {{to the roof of}} the diencephalon, with well-de-veloped photoreceptor, supporting and ganglion cells. The photoreceptors gradu-ally degenerate, giving way to secretory cells which contain electron dense gran-ules. These latter are immunoreactive to melatonin antibodies and digestable with protease. The pituitary at hatching comprises a hollow ball of cells lying beneath the infundibular region of the hypothalamus. Ultrastructurally, four cell types can be distinguished by cytoplasmic granule size after the first four weeks of devel-opment posthatching. By 20 weeks, a further three cell types are recognisable. Inununogold labelling has identified corticotropes and melanotropes at four weeks and, at 20 weeks, prolactin cells, thyrotropes and somatotropes also can be iden-tified.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{moderate}} and severe hypoxia on air breathing frequency and respiratory {{properties of the}} blood of the Queensland (Australian) lungfish <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri</b> were measured in fish exposed to these conditions for 14 - 22 days at 20 degrees C. Haemoglobin oxygen affinity increased after exposure to moderate hypoxia (PwO 2 = 60 mmHg), but did not increase further after exposure to severe hypoxia (PwO 2 = 40 mmHg). The P 50 of whole blood (20 degrees C, PCO 2 = 16. 0 mmHg) fell from 22. 0 +/- 1. 5 mmHg in normoxic conditions to 19. 0 +/- 1. 0 mmHg in hypoxic conditions. Under both moderate and severe hypoxia, haematocrit, haemoglobin, blood lactate, and erythrocyte phosphate concentrations did not differ from normoxic values. The observed increase in haemoglobin oxygen affinity in response to aquatic hypoxia is typical of compensatory responses seen in obligate water breathers, but smaller. This suggests that the capacity of lungfish to respond to hypoxia by breathing air removes the necessity for further left-shifting of the oxygen equilibrium curve...|$|R
40|$|The dentary, a {{component}} of the transient marginal dentition found in the mandible of juveniles of the living Australian lungfish <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri,</b> is a tooth plate exactly comparable to the tooth plates with radiating ridges that make up the marginal dentitions of Devonian dipnoans like Andreyevichthys, Orlovichthys and Ichnomylax. In N. forsteri, the dentary consists of two ridges, set almost in line with each other, and growing by the addition of cusps, of increasing sizes, to the extremity of each ridge. It is therefore equivalent to two ridges of a more normal tooth plate with radiating ridges. Despite its appearance, as a long row of sharp cusps ankylosed to a slender bone, and its position, embedded in soft tissue above the anterolabial margin of Meckel 2 ̆ 7 s cartilage, it is a tooth plate and is not comparable to the marginal dentitions of other vertebrates.

40|$|Ultrastructural {{descriptions}} of the dipnoan heart are lacking. Many ultrastructural features of {{the heart of the}} Australian lungfish, <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri,</b> resemble those of other fewer vertebrates. The epicardial cells appear to be adapated for the exchange of material with the pericardial fluid. The most prominent features of the endocardial cells are numerous moderately electron-dense vesicles found within the cytoplasm. These organelles might have an endocrine function. The myocardiocytes are typically small. The banding pattern of the sarcomere is shared with most fish. The intercalated disc has a convoluted path and consists of desmosomes and fascia adherens. Caveolae are a prominent feature of the sarcoplasm. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is sparse, and T-tubules are lacking. Atrial myocardial dense bodies occur in vast numbers throughout the atrium and are occasionally seen in the ventricle. These vesicles are chromaffin-positive but fail to show catecholamine fluorescence. They are likely to contain peptides related to ANP. Subendothelial cells exhibiting catecholamine-specific fluorescence are scattered throughout the atrium. Ultrastructurally these cells contain many chromaffin-positive granules. Chromaffin cells represent another cell type with a probable endocrine function within the heart of N. forsteri. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of the lungfish immune system is limited. This study is characterizing the immune cells separated from primary and secondary immune organs of the Australian lungfish, <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri.</b> Our functional studies utilized flow cytometry to study the immune cells extracted from the thymus, spiral valve intestine, spleen, and kidney. The different characteristics of lymphocytes and granulocytes were analyzed by utilization of viability, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and apoptosis assays. Most of the nonviable intestinal cells were lymphocytes. Depending on the organ, 6 - 25 % of the total population, predominantly granulocytes, underwent phagocytosis where the splenic cells were the most and intestinal cells the least phagocytic cells. Cells responded positively but differently to stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to produce radical oxygen species, an indication of their oxidative burst activity, which was mainly associated with granulocytes. Although cells were induced by dexamethasone to undergo apoptosis, such an induction did not follow a consistent pattern of dose of dexamethasone or incubation time between the different organs. In the absence of monoclonal antibodies against lungfish immune cells, these functional flow cytometric analyses aid our understanding on the functionality of immune cells. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{transition}} from water to land {{was a key}} event {{in the evolution of}} vertebrates that occurred over a period of 15 – 20 million years {{towards the end of the}} Devonian. Tetrapods, including all land-living vertebrates, are thought to have evolved from lobe-finned (sarcopterygian) fish that developed adaptations for an amphibious existence. However, while many of the biomechanical and physiological modifications necessary to achieve this feat have been studied in detail, little is known about the sensory adaptations accompanying this transition. In this study, we investigated the visual system and visual ecology of the Australian lungfish <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri,</b> which is the most primitive of all the lungfish and possibly the closest living relative to the ancestors of tetrapods. Results: Juvenile Neoceratodus have five spectrally distinct retinal visual pigments. A single type of rod photoreceptor contains a visual pigment with a wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax) at 540 nm. Four spectrally distinct single cone photoreceptors contain visual pigments with λmax at 366 (UVS), 479 (SWS), 558 (MWS) and 623 nm (LWS). No double cones were found.

In N. forsteri the ascending process of the pterygopalatine bone is angled, flattened and slightly twisted at the distal extremity, and fits within a socket on the descending process of the JLM bone. M. anemosyrus has a short, angled ascending pterygopalatine process with two lateral suture facets that fit within a matching groove in the descending process of the JLM bone. In protopterid species the descending process of the JLM bone is a simple peg fitting within a groove in the elongate ascending pterygopalatine process. A pterygopalatine/calvarial suture appears to be reduced or absent in more primitive dipnoans, and to have a different form in gnathorhizids.

40|$|The {{presence}} of {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOS) and role of nitric oxide (NO) in vascular regulation was investigated in the Australian lungfish, <b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri.</b> No evidence was found for NOS in the endothelium of large and small blood vessels following processing for NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry. However, both NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry and neural NOS immunohistochemistry demonstrated a sparse network of nitrergic nerves in the dorsal aorta, hepatic artery, and branchial arteries, {{but there were no}} nitrergic nerves in small blood vessels in tissues. In contrast, nitrergic nerves were found in non-vascular tissues of the lung, gut and kidney. Dual-wire myography was used to determine if NO signalling occurred in the branchial artery of N. forsteri. Both SNP and SIN- 1 had no effect on the pre-constricted branchial artery, but the particulate guanylyl cyclase (GC) activator, C-type natriuretic peptide, always caused vasodilation. Nicotine mediated a dilation that was not inhibited by the soluble GC inhibitor, ODQ, or the NOS inhibitor, L-NNA, but was blocked by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. These data suggest that NO control of the branchial artery is lacking, but that prostaglandins could be endothelial relaxing factors in the vasculature of lungfish. <br /...|$|R

We studied laterality in the Australian lungfish (<b>Neoceratodus</b> <b>forsteri)</b> to {{gain insight}} into {{the evolution of the}} complementary specializations of predator avoidance (right hemisphere) and foraging behavior (left hemisphere). Because N. forsteri is the closest extant ancestor of the first land-dwelling vertebrates, knowledge of laterality in this species should provide a missing link in the transition from fish to tetrapods. Predator escape responses were elicited by generating pressure waves and a significant bias for C-start responses to the left side was found. This bias was unaffected by activity levels that change according to a diurnal cycle: activity is higher in the dark phase than the light phase. A complementary bias to turn to the right side was found during feeding behavior. This pattern of opposite-side specializations matches that known for fish, anurans, reptiles, birds and, as some evidence indicates, also mammals. Hence, we conclude that it is a homologous pattern of lateralization that evolved in early aquatic vertebrates and was retained as they made the transition to land-dwelling tetrapods. 9 page(s...|$|R
