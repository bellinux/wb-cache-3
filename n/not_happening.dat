5|$|In March 2012, Sujoy Ghosh {{announced}} {{that he intended to}} develop Kahaani into a series. He was inspired by Satyajit Ray's Feluda detective series and wanted to continue the stories of Vidya Bagchi on similar lines, with Vidya Balan reprising the role. The shooting of Kahaani 2 was scheduled to begin in 2013, but in July 2013 differences arose between Sujoy Ghosh and other co-producers. In February 2014, Vidya {{announced that}} the sequel was <b>not</b> <b>happening</b> due to these differences, but two years later, Ghosh confirmed that the film was in pre-production with Vidya set to reprise her role. The sequel, entitled Kahaani 2, began filming in March 2016 with Vidya and Arjun Rampal in lead roles, and was released on 2 December 2016.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, Kud Wafter ranked {{first in}} {{national}} PC game pre-orders in Japan. The limited edition version of Kud Wafter ranked first {{in terms of}} national sales of PC games in Japan in June 2010. In addition, Kud Wafter was reported to sell the most copies of any PC game in Japan {{for the first half}} of 2010. At some stores in Akihabara, Kud Wafter was sold at midnight the day of its release, which is cited as <b>not</b> <b>happening</b> very often for games sold in Akihabara. Kud Wafter premiered as the No. 2 game sold on Getchu.com, a major redistributor of visual novel and domestic anime products, during the month of its release, and at No. 26 in July. The game would go on to be the No. 9 game sold {{for the first half of}} 2010, and at No. 15 for the whole year. The PSP port sold 5,733 units in its first week of sales.

5|$|The {{only real}} {{threat of a}} black {{rebellion}} in Southern Rhodesia during the war occurred in May 1916, immediately after the Company instructed native commissioners in Matabeleland to start recruiting for the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Company officials attempted {{to make clear that}} the RNR comprised volunteers only, and most Matabele chiefs were not unreceptive to the idea—some, including Chief Ndiweni, attempted to encourage enlistment by sending their own sons off to war—but rumours spread in some quarters that black men were going to be involuntarily conscripted wholesale into the unit. Chief Maduna, in Insiza district, briefly threatened insurrection, issuing rifles to 100 men, but he backed down after a few weeks after it became self-evident that conscription was <b>not</b> <b>happening.</b> Some attempted to dissuade potential RNR recruits from signing up, including a black man in Bulawayo who was fined £4 in July 1915 for spreading a false rumour around the city that the British East Africa Transport Corps' black Southern Rhodesian drivers had had their throats cut by the Germans. Matthew Zwimba, founder of the syncretist Church of the White Bird in Mashonaland, received six months' hard labour the following year for advising black men not to join the RNR {{on the grounds that the}} British had, he said, committed crimes against God in 1913.|$|E

In 2011, UN under-secretary general Achim Steiner said: [...] "The continuing growth in this core segment of the green economy is <b>not</b> <b>happening</b> by chance.

In doing so, they are making an increasing contribution to combating climate change, countering energy poverty and energy insecurity".|$|E

500|$|Quentin Tarantino was {{originally}} intended to direct this episode, but was stopped from doing so by the Directors Guild of America. [...] Although the episode was written specifically for Tarantino to direct, the DGA complained that Tarantino, {{who is not a}} member, failed to join the union after working on ER as a director, per an agreement between the two entities. A spokeswoman from 20th Century Fox later noted, [...] "Quentin approached us, we were very excited at the opportunity.

It was produced by American record producer Ron Aniello and was mixed by Brendan O'Brien. Musically, [...] "Hanging by a Moment" [...] is a post-grunge song that contains influences of alternative rock. The song was first released in the United States on August 16, 2000 by DreamWorks Records. It peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and is the band's most successful single to date on the chart. Despite not peaking at number one, it was the number one single of 2001, becoming only the third (and currently last) single to top the year-end charts despite never spending a week {{at the top of the}} weekly charts and followed [...] "Breathe" [...] from the previous year in completing this feat, marking the second consecutive year this feat had been accomplished despite it <b>not</b> <b>happening</b> for 35 years prior to 2000.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{continues}} the storyline of Tom and Lynette's separation.

[...] Doug Savant commented, [...] "For many years on this show, we knew that Tom and Lynette were the grounding force on the street. They were the couple that most resembled most couples in America. It just got to a point after so many years when [...] really wanted to explore the things that made this relationship work by first pulling it apart." [...] Both actors expressed their desire for the couple to reunite by the series' end. Charles Mesure made his debut as new neighbor Ben Faulkner, a self-made contractor and Renee's new love interest.

500|$|Although Becky Bain of Idolator called Knowles' vocals [...] "gorgeous", {{he gave a}} mixed {{review for}} the song because it [...] "could have been {{recorded}} by anyone and ended with similar results" [...] with the one done by Knowles. Bain stated that Knowles should have [...] "procure more polarizing songs and take bigger risks — at least then half of her fans would love it, as opposed to her entire fanbase shrugging at everything they hear." [...] NMEs Hamish MacBain classified the song {{as one of the}} [...] "barely distinguishable slowies" [...] and added that the [...] "will to continue listening [...] departs." [...] Andrew Unterberger of the website Popdust gave a negative review for [...] "Start Over" [...] grading it with two out of five stars. Comparing it with Knowles' older material, Unterberger concluded: [...] "Beyoncé tries her best to imbue them with legitimate emotion, especially on the chorus, but it's just <b>not</b> <b>happening</b> this time around." [...] Ricky Schweitzer of the website Beats Per Minute concluded that songs like [...] "I Miss You" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] would earn deserved spots in [...] "the Beyoncé pantheon" [...] once fans take the time to grow attached to them. Elan Priya of NME wrote that the song was a [...] "trouble-in-paradise tune" [...] with an [...] "overblown chorus with hair-rock aspirations". However, he commented that the song was [...] "rather buried under sonic bluster".|$|E
