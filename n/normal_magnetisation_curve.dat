40|$|A fully {{automatic}} {{system has been}} designed for the accurate measurement of the DC magnetic properties of soft and hard ferromagnetic materials utilising discrete calibrated instruments {{in order to provide}} a traceable calibration route separate from the transfer of standard magnetic test samples. Custom written software is used to operate the system in one of three modes, constant dH/dt, variable dH/dt and a second quadrant demagnetisation curve mode. The first two of these modes are utilised for soft magnetic materials with the second mode varying dH/dt in order to keep dB/dt relatively constant. Both modes use cycle times of between 60 and 300 s and may utilise a variety of test configurations including a bar permeameter, electromagnet, ring samples or Epstein frame. The minimum cycle time and the most appropriate mode is dependent on the particular sample and the effect of this on materials with a large dB/dH is significant. Measurements on soft materials include major BH loop, minor BH loops, first-order reversal curves, remanence, coercivity, <b>normal</b> <b>magnetisation</b> <b>curve,</b> peak permeability and loop area. The third mode is used with an electromagnet to measure the demagnetisation curve of hard magnetic materials up to a maximum demagnetisation field of 1. 6 MA/m. The measurement algorithm modulates dH/dt depending on dB/dt and incorporates holdback in order to accommodate rare earth materials which exhibit high viscosity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} applied {{external}} {{stress on the}} magnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials has been recognised {{as one of the}} most important ferromagnetic phenomena for over a century. Research into the field has been driven by investigations of non-destructive testing, degaussing, and maritime applications. A comprehensive investigation of the magnetomechanical behaviour of mild steel under static biaxial stresses was undertaken with the intention of adapting and improving techniques of obtaining magnetic and strain data, producing accurate data for analysis, and developing insights into a tentative alternative theory of stress and magnetism. A method of obtaining Initial <b>Magnetisation</b> <b>Curves</b> is presented which equates them with <b>Normal</b> <b>Magnetisation</b> <b>Curves.</b> A conceptual mechanism by which applied stress and magnetism interact is introduced in order to explain coincident points and kinks on hysteresis loops obtained at different, static biaxial stresses.

However, an uncertainty band always remains. Non-linear numerical simulations based on e. g. the Newton-Raphson method may establish a poor convergence {{if they are}} provided directly with measured data.

40|$|Fine {{particle}} magnetism {{is employed}} {{in a wide}} range of applications ranging from magnetic data recording to cancer therapies. Characterisation of nanoparticles is important for improving their applicability. This is a complex task, especially if magnetostatic interactions are to be considered. Here we have developed a methodology to investigate the inverse problem, which consists of extracting the magnetic properties such as anisotropy, size or saturation magnetisation from experimental <b>magnetisation</b> <b>curves.</b> For each set of magnetic properties a <b>magnetisation</b> <b>curve</b> can always be obtained, but from a <b>magnetisation</b> <b>curve</b> the parameters cannot always be uniquely determined. If interactions are significant the issue becomes complicated and the question of whether the parameters can be uniquely identified arises. To study this we simulated the magnetic behaviour of interacting nanoparticles with Monte-Carlo techniques and applied two different methods for studying the inverse problem. This allows to show that a unique extraction of model parameters is indeed possible only in a certain range of magnetic nanoparticle concentrations and temperatures. Using simulations we investigated the inverse problem for two parameters, anisotropy and saturation magnetisation, at different temperatures. At low temperature both parameters can be well determined, but the errors and the parameters correlation is dependent on the strength of the magnetostatic interaction. In the high temperature case, due to superparamagnetic behaviour, only the saturation magnetisation can obtain using the inverse problem approach. The methodology was also tested for a set of experimental measurements done on magnetite nanoparticles. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{magnetic}} behaviour of a (tetragonal) TbFe 3. 5 Al 8. 5 single crystal extending earlier work on a TbFe 4. 4 Al 7. 6 one. At 5 K, the <b>magnetisation</b> <b>curve</b> measured along the [0 0 1] direction points to easy-plane behaviour, whereas that along the [1 0 0] direction shows a strong hysteresis, coercivity field of about 0. 5 T and a remanence of 5. 0 mB/f. u. A similar behaviour is observed when the field is applied along the [1 1 0] direction, the remanence now being 3. 7 mB/f. u., which corresponds closely to 1 2 O 2 of the remanence measured along the [1 0 0] direction. It is concluded that the orthorhombically distorted ferrimagnetic state, found to be field-induced for TbFe 4. 4 Al 7. 6, is formed spontaneously in TbFe 3. 5 Al 8. 5. The magnetisation was measured at increasing temperature {{in a field of}} 0. 05 T applied along the [1 0 0] direction. After field cooling (FC), the magnetisation decreases from about 4. 8 mB/f. u. at 5 K down to about zero at 110 K. After zero-field cooling (ZFC), the magnetisation starts with a very small (consistently negative) value, passes through a maximum (at about 60 K) and then joins the FC curve.
