Includes bibliographical references. In this thesis, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lot</b> {{streaming}} {{problems in}} flow, open and job shops are investigated. Lot streaming {{is the process}} of splitting a job to allow for overlapping of its operations on various machines resulting in shorter completion times. When there is a single job, the problem is to find the size of the transfer batches (“sublots”) which minimizes a given performance measure (e. g., makespan, mean flow time). Multi-job problems are harder, since sequencing and sizing decisions must be made simultaneously. Most of the current research in lot streaming is concerned with minimum makespan problems in flow shops. In this study, other performance measures and shop structures are also analyzed. Optimal sublot sizes are derived for the single job two machine flow shop mean flow time problem. Solution methods are proposed for the minimum makespan problem in open shops both for multiple job and single job cases. Şen, AlperM. S...|$|E
40|$|While {{focusing}} on lot splitting in the job-shop scheduling problem, this study attempts {{to minimize the}} weighted total of stock, machine idle and carrying costs. Stock cost is determined using processing time. Machine idle cost is estimated using machine idle time. Carrying cost is calculated using the carry <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lot</b> splitting. Results of this study demonstrate that stock cost and machine idle cost are inversely related {{to the number of}} lots split and have marginal decreasing result of benefit. The benefit of processing time is not as apparent as that of count and increase in turn. Carrying cost is positively related to the number of lots split. The minimum weighted total cost of stock, machine idle and carrying costs typically appears when the number of lots split is 2 or 3. The ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is used to solve the job-shop scheduling problem. Compared with the solution obtained by LINGO, the ACO algorithm performs well in scheduling and uses less time to solve the problem. Ant colony optimization Lot-splitting Job-shop scheduling...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} many firms have been {{implementing}} small lot size production. Lot splitting breaks large orders into smaller transfer lots and offers {{the ability to}} move parts more quickly through the production process. This paper extends the deterministic studies by investigating various lot splitting policies in both stochastic job shop and stochastic flow shop settings using performance measures of mean flow time and the standard deviation of flow time. Using a computer simulation experiment, we found that in stochastic dynamic job shops, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lot</b> splits {{is more important than the}} exact fonn of splitting. However, when optimal job sizes are determined for each scenario, we found a few circumstances where the implementation of a small initial split, called a "flag," can provide measurable improvement in flow time performance. Interestingly, the vast majority of previous research indicates that methods other than equal lot splitting typically improves makespan performance. The earlier research, however, has been set in the static, deterministic flow shop environment. Thus, our results are of practical interest since they show that the specific method of lot splitting is important in only a small set of realistic environments while the choice of an appropriate number of splits is typically more important...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extended approximation model based on mean value analysis (MVA) technique for a probabilistic re-entrant line. The {{objective is to}} develop a solution method to determine the total cycle time and mean throughput of the environmental stress testing (EST) operation for a given <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> loaded into the system. Further work was done to determine the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> that can be loaded into the system and the target cycle time. This paper also looks at alternative ways to assign human resources within the operation in the event <b>of</b> large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> required. Using analytical and simulation methods, comparison results were made for a five-stage queuing system with re-entrant lines into the second stage under various probabilistic routing conditions. The method proposed can be used by operation managers to determine their lots' cycle times, maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> and the operator assignments. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|The tick {{value is}} the product of tick size and {{contract}} size. Contract size is equal to the product of the base Nifty price and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> market <b>lots</b> traded. Here, the Nifty base value was constant and the tick size was constant. The tick-value-size ratio, and hence price discreteness, depended on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> market <b>lots</b> (market depth). Therefore, price discreteness and its optimality were evaluated through the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> market <b>lots.</b> This stage <b>of</b> estimation observed that trading prices and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> market <b>lots</b> were positively related. However, with negative credit availability, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> market <b>lots</b> had negative impact on returns during all trading hours. Therefore, price discreteness had a negative impact on returns.|$|R

50|$|After {{the fall}} of the Roman Empire, all of the {{classical}} legacy, including astrology, fell to the Abbasid Arabs and Persians. Arab astrologers translated sources from Greek and produced many of their own astrologers who wrote a considerable amount in Arabic on astrology. Although {{it is not clear whether}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> began to proliferate in late Antiquity or whether it was purely the product of the fascination the Arabs had for them, Arabic manuscripts show an explosion in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> that were used over the next several centuries. The inordinate increase is noted by the Arab commentators themselves. In The Abbreviation of the Introduction to Astrology, Persian astrologer Abu Ma'Shar (787-886) describes no less than 55 lots, although it's clear that these are only the ones he considers significant. This count does not even include all <b>of</b> the <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> Paulus.|$|R

Using discrete [...] time analysis, we derive the interdeparture time distribution for batches and for single lots. It is shown that the interdeparture time distribution of a batch service system has characteristic properties that can not be approximated with sufficient accuracy by other commonly used distributions.

40|$|Abstract: This {{work was}} carried out to test whether {{germination}} of fifteen Lagenaria siceraria genotypes which were collected from western and southern parts of Turkey were improved by KNO 3 and NaCl treatments. The experiment was conducted in two consecutive years, 2004 and 2005. Germination tests were performed at 15 0 C and 18 0 C. Results indicated {{that the effect of}} the treatments varied between the genotypes, temperatures and solutions that were used. KNO 3 treatment was better and effective in larger <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> than NaCl in both years. NaCl promoted germination in a few but inhibitive in large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lots</b> at both temperatures. As germination temperature was reduced, the positive effect of the KNO 3 became greater. As a conclusion, priming treatments, specifically KNO 3, appears to be promising in enhancing germination percentages of Lagenaria siceraria particularly at 15 0 C that is the prevailing temperature in rootstock production for grafted watermelon seedling in unheated glasshouse conditions in early spring...|$|R
