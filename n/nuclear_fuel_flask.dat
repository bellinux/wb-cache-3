50|$|Through-services to Lydney on {{the line}} ceased {{abruptly}} in October 1960 when the Severn Railway Bridge was damaged beyond economic repair in a shipping accident. The station closed on 2 November 1964, when passenger services ceased on the Sharpness branch; goods facilities were withdrawn two years later. The station buildings were demolished though the stationmaster's house remains. A gantry crane was installed over a single remaining siding in the former goods yard to allow the loading of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>flasks</b> from Berkeley <b>nuclear</b> power station which saw regular, if infrequent, use. The power station was decommissioned in 1989 but the siding and crane remain in place. The track through the site remains as the Sharpness docks link is still open for very occasional freight services.|$|R
50|$|The station {{presently}} uses {{two large}} island platforms, each served by loop lines which diverge from and rejoin the main lines in each direction. The main lines pass {{between the two}} operational platforms, and are used for passing empty stock movements, for terminated trains to lay-over awaiting their next working, and freight services, particularly the carriage of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>flasks</b> to and from Wylfa nuclear power station on Anglesey. At {{the western end of}} the station at the mouth of Belmont Tunnel, is a cross-over between the up main line and the down main line. Diverging from the down main line, also at the western end of the station, are four sidings; two adjacent to the most southerly platform island, and the other two enclosed within the nearby Network Rail engineering compound. Bangor signal box, which {{can be found at the}} western end of the up-direction platform, is lever-operated and controls the signals, points and user-worked level crossings as far as Abergwyngregyn to the east of Bangor, and Llanfairpwll to the west, including the single line crossing the Britannia Bridge between the Welsh mainland and Anglesey.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent developments}} {{in the field of}} nuclear waste management in Canada with a focus on management of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> waste. Of particular significance is the April 2001 tabling in the Canadian House of Commons of Bill C- 27, An Act respecting the long-term management of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> waste. At the time of finalizing this paper (January 15, 2002), Bill C- 27 is in Third Reading in the House of Commons and is expected to move to the Senate in February. The <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Fuel</b> Waste Act is expected to come into force later in 2002. This Act requires the three nuclear utilities in Canada owning <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> waste to form a waste management organization and deposit funds into a segregated fund for <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> waste long-term management. The waste management organization is then required to perform a study of long-term management approaches for <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> waste and submit the study to the federal government within three years. The federal government will select an approach for implementation by the waste management organization. The paper discusses the activities that the <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> waste owners currently have underway to prepare for the formation of the waste management organization. As background, the paper reviews the status of interim storage of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> waste in Canada, and describes previous initiatives related {{to the development of a}} national strategy for <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> waste long-term management...|$|R
