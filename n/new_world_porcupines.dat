5|$|Some {{species such}} as tree {{squirrels}} and <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines</b> are arboreal, while some, such as gophers, tuco-tucos, and mole rats, live almost completely underground, where they build complex burrow systems. Others dwell {{on the surface of}} the ground, but may have a burrow into which they can retreat. Beavers and muskrats are known for being semiaquatic, but the rodent best-adapted for aquatic life is probably the earless water rat from New Guinea. Rodents have also thrived in human-created environments such as agricultural and urban areas.|$|E
500|$|Rodents {{participated in}} the Great American Interchange that {{resulted}} from the joining of the Americas by formation of the Isthmus of Panama, around 3 million {{years ago in the}} Piacenzian age. In this exchange, a [...] such as the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines</b> (Erethizontidae) headed north. However, the main southward invasion of sigmodontines preceded formation of the land bridge by at least several million years, probably occurring via rafting. Sigmodontines diversified explosively once in South America, although some degree of diversification may have already occurred in Central America before the colonization. Their [...] "head start" [...] has relegated other North American rodent groups (sciurids, geomyids, heteromyids and nonsigmodontine cricetids) to a minor presence in the contemporary South American fauna.|$|E

5000|$|The Erethizontinae is a {{subfamily}} of the <b>New</b> <b>world</b> <b>porcupine</b> family Erethizontidae, {{and includes}} all {{species of the}} family {{with the exception of}} the Bristle-spined rat, Chaetomys subspinosus, which is classified in its own subfamily, the [...] Chaetomyinae.|$|R
50|$|The quill {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} floats, originally it was a bird feather quill but with the opening up of <b>new</b> <b>worlds,</b> <b>porcupine</b> quills from Africa became a standard for the float. It is fished {{in the same way as}} a stick float.|$|R
50|$|Their skulls are {{unusual in}} several ways. The eye socket is almost {{completely}} {{surrounded by a}} ring of bone. Incisors are distinctly narrow. Overall, the animal displays a mix of <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupine</b> cranial characters, spiny rat cranial characters, and characters that set it apart from all other rodents.|$|R

50|$|The two subfamilies of <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>{{porcupine}}s</b> {{are mostly}} smaller (although the North American porcupine reaches about 85 cm {{in length and}} 18 kg), have their quills attached singly rather than grouped in clusters, and are excellent climbers, spending {{much of their time}} in trees. The <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines</b> evolved their spines independently (through convergent evolution) and are more closely related to several other families of rodents than they are to the Old World porcupines.|$|E
50|$|<b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines</b> {{of the genera}} Coendou and Chaetomys have fully prehensile tails {{that help}} them to climb and prevent them from falling from trees.|$|E
50|$|The Old <b>World</b> <b>porcupines,</b> or Hystricidae, {{are large}} {{terrestrial}} rodents, distinguished by the spiny covering {{from which they}} take their name. They range over the south of Europe and the Levant, most of Africa, India, and the maritime Southeast Asia as far east as Flores. Although both the Old <b>World</b> and <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupine</b> families belong to the Hystricognathi branch of the vast order Rodentia, they are quite different and are not closely related.|$|R
50|$|Roosmalen's dwarf {{porcupine}}, Coendou roosmalenorum, is a porcupine {{species from}} the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupine</b> family endemic to northern Brazil. It {{is named for}} Marc van Roosmalen and his son Tomas, whose collections from the middle Madeira included the first known specimens. It was formerly sometimes assigned to Sphiggurus, a genus no longer recognized since genetic studies showed it to be polyphyletic.|$|R
50|$|The Bahia porcupine, Coendou insidiosus, is a <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupine</b> {{species in}} the family Erethizontidae endemic to the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. It was {{formerly}} sometimes assigned to Sphiggurus, a genus no longer recognized since genetic studies showed it to be polyphyletic. Sphiggurus pallidus, formerly considered a separate species but known from two young specimens only, is a synonym of this species.|$|R
50|$|Old and <b>New</b> <b>world</b> <b>porcupines</b> {{shared a}} common ancestor, both evolved strikingly similar quill structures; this is also an example of {{convergent}} evolution as similar structures evolved in hedgehogs, echidnas and tenrecs.|$|E
50|$|Porcupines' quills, or spines, take {{on various}} forms, {{depending}} on the species, but all are modified hairs coated with thick plates of keratin, and embedded in the skin musculature. Old World porcupines have quills embedded in clusters, whereas in <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines,</b> single quills are interspersed with bristles, underfur, and hair.|$|E
50|$|The <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines</b> are {{indigenous}} to North America and northern South America. They live in wooded areas and can climb trees, where some species spend their entire lives. They are less strictly nocturnal than their Old World relatives, and generally smaller. In taxonomic terms, they form the family Erethizontidae.|$|E
50|$|The {{black dwarf}} {{porcupine}}, {{also known as}} Koopman's porcupine, Coendou nycthemera, is a porcupine species from the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupine</b> family endemic to northern Brazil. It occurs in the Amazon rainforest east of the Madeira River {{and south of the}} Amazon River. It inhabits primary forest and possibly second growth. It was described as Coendou koopmani by Charles O. Handley, Jr. and Ronald H. Pine in 1992, but was subsequently found to be identical to a species described in 1818. It is nocturnal and herbivorous.|$|R
50|$|The North American {{porcupine}} (Erethizon dorsatum), {{also known}} as the Canadian porcupine or common porcupine, is a large rodent in the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupine</b> family. The beaver is the only rodent in North America that is larger than the North American porcupine. The porcupine is a caviomorph rodent whose ancestors rafted across the Atlantic from Africa to Brazil over 30 million years ago, and then migrated to North America during the Great American Interchange after the Isthmus of Panama rose 3 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|The bristle-spined rat, Chaetomys subspinosus, has {{sometimes}} been classified in Echimyidae, although traditionally considered {{a member of the}} <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupine</b> family Erethizontidae. The classification with Echimyidae is supported by similarities in the cheek teeth structure.Like all living caviomorphs except erethizontids, Chaetomys seems to lack posterior carotid foramina, and together with all echimyids and in contrast to all other caviomorphs, Chaetomys seems to retain the otherwise deciduous premolars (dP4).Some of these characters have been, however, reinterpreted as evidence for affinities between Chaetomys and the Erethizontidae.A molecular phylogeny based on the mitochondrial gene coding for cytochrome b combined to karyological evidence actually suggests Chaetomys is more closely related to the Erethizontidae than to the Echimyidae, although it branches as the sister group {{to the rest of the}} Erethizontidae.|$|R
50|$|The <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines,</b> family Erethizontidae, {{are large}} {{arboreal}} rodents, distinguished by their spiny coverings {{from which they}} take their name. They inhabit forests and wooded regions across North America, and into northern South America. Although both the New World and Old World porcupine families belong to the Hystricognathi branch of the vast order Rodentia, they are quite different and are not closely related.|$|E
50|$|Porcupines {{occupy a}} short range of {{habitats}} in tropical and temperate parts of Asia, Southern Europe, Africa, and North and South America. They live in forests and deserts, and on rocky outcrops and hillsides. Some <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines</b> live in trees, but Old World porcupines {{stay on the}} rocks. Porcupines {{can be found on}} rocky areas up to 3700 m high. They are generally nocturnal, but are occasionally active during daylight.|$|E
50|$|Hundreds of rodent fossils {{have been}} found at Santa Rosa, many of which cannot be {{identified}} precisely. These rodents are referable to the caviomorph group of rodents, which is unique to the Americas, and includes at least eleven species classified in the families Erethizontidae (<b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines),</b> Echimyidae (spiny rats), and Agoutidae (agoutis). All Santa Rosa rodents share a common morphological pattern of the teeth, suggestive of a basal place in the caviomorph radiation.|$|E

50|$|<b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines</b> are stout animals, with blunt, rounded heads, fleshy, mobile snouts, {{and coats}} of thick, {{cylindrical}} or flattened spines ("quills"). The spines {{are mixed with}} long, soft hairs. They vary in size from the relatively small prehensile-tailed porcupines, which are around 30 cm long, and weigh about 900 g, to the much larger North American porcupine, which has a body length of 86 cm, and weighs up to 18 kg.|$|E
50|$|Its {{seedlings}} are not {{a preferred}} browse of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) and elk (Cervus canadensis), but {{can be an important}} food source for these animals during the winter when other preferred forages are lacking. In many areas, coast Douglas-fir needles are a staple in the spring diet of blue grouse (Dendragapus). In the winter, <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines</b> primarily eat the inner bark of young conifers, among which they prefer Douglas-fir.|$|E
50|$|Eopululo is {{the oldest}} known genus of <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines</b> (Erethizontidae). It is known only from the {{possibly}} late Late Eocene to Early Oligocene (Divisaderan to Deseadan in the SALMA classification) of the Yahuarango Formation at the Santa Rosa local fauna site of Ucayali Department, eastern Peru. There is only one species in the genus, Eopululo wigmorei. It was described in 2004, {{and it is a}} member of one of the oldest rodent faunas known from South America.|$|E

50|$|Porcupines are rodentian mammals with a coat {{of sharp}} spines, or quills, that protect against predators. The term covers two {{families}} of animals, the Old World porcupines of family Hystricidae, and the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines</b> of family Erethizontidae. Both families belong to the class Hystricognathi within the profoundly diverse order Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of quills: despite this, the two groups are distinct {{from each other and}} are not closely related to each other within the Hystricognathi.|$|E
50|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached as to the taxonomic position of Chaetomys. It is commonly placed with the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>porcupines</b> in the family Erethizontidae or with the spiny rats the family Echimyidae. Both are South American hystricognaths with hairs modified as spines or quills. Chaetomys has more highly developed spines than the spiny rats, but less developed than the porcupines. Characteristics of the premolar suggest that it belongs with the Echimyidae, but characteristics of the incisor enamel suggest that it belongs in the Erethizontidae.|$|E
