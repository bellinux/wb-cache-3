5|$|FXX premiered The Simpsons {{on their}} network on August 21, 2014 by {{starting}} a twelve-day marathon which featured the first 552 episodes (every single episode {{that had already}} been released at the time) aired chronologically, including The Simpsons Movie, which FX Networks had already owned the rights to air. It was the longest continuous marathon in the history of television (until VH1 Classic aired a 433-hour, nineteen-day, marathon of Saturday Night Live in 2015; celebrating that program's 40th anniversary). The first day of the marathon was the highest rated broadcast day {{in the history of the}} network so far, the ratings more than tripled that those of regular prime time programming for FXX. Ratings during the first six nights of the marathon grew <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night,</b> with the network ranking within the top 5 networks in basic cable each night.|$|E

Despite Layla being the official champion, McCool {{participated in the}} match and won with Layla's help to unify both championships. Once again, they reigned unofficially as co-champions, wearing two belts and declaring themselves the WWE Unified Divas Champions while the Women's Championship was retired. The <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>Night</b> of Champions on Raw, Layla defended the Unified Divas Championship against Melina, cementing their status as co-champions.|$|E
25|$|Turtles {{can rest}} or sleep {{underwater}} {{for several hours}} at a time, but submergence time is much shorter while diving for food or to escape predators. Breath-holding ability is affected by activity and stress, which is why turtles quickly drown in shrimp trawlers and other fishing gear. During the night while sleeping and {{to protect themselves from}} potential predators, the adults wedge themselves under rocks below the surface and under ledges in reefs and coastal rocks. Many green sea turtles have been observed in returning to the same sleeping location <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E

25|$|State Guards were {{reformed}} {{for internal}} security duties {{to replace the}} National Guardsmen who were federalized and sent overseas. The Civil Air Patrol was established, which enrolled civilian spotters in air reconnaissance, search-and-rescue, and transport. Its Coast Guard counterpart, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, used civilian boats and crews in similar rescue roles. Towers were built in coastal and border towns, and spotters were trained to recognize enemy aircraft. Blackouts were practiced in every city, even those far from the coast. All exterior lighting had to be extinguished, and black-out curtains placed over windows. The main purpose was {{to remind people that}} there was a war on and to provide activities that would engage the civil spirit of millions of people not otherwise involved in the war effort. In large part, this effort was successful, sometimes almost to a fault, such as the Plains states where many dedicated aircraft spotters took up their posts <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night</b> watching the skies in an area of the country that no enemy aircraft of that time could possibly hope to reach.|$|E
25|$|Previous to Dugger, {{several books}} claimed Scott was a {{mistress}} of Hal Wallis, then married to actress Louise Fazenda. Wallis had a falling out with Scott {{around the time}} of Bad for Each Other, with recriminations on Wallis' part. After Scott freelanced for a few years, Wallis made an effort to revive the relationship by making Scott the leading lady opposite Presley, as it might be his last chance to star Scott in anything. After shooting was completed, Scott walked away from film acting to try her hand at singing. The 14-year-relationship that began at the Stork Club in 1943 came to an end. Scott herself knew the relationship was over—only Wallis remained in denial. After Louise's death in 1962, Wallis went into a depression and became a recluse before marrying Martha Hyer in 1966. In later life, he was reticent on the subject of Scott, despite an unjealous Hyer urging him to include Scott and his other mistresses in his autobiography. Though Casablanca was the film of which Wallis was most proud, the ones he watched repeatedly were those starring Lizabeth Scott. Even during his second marriage, Wallis continued to screen Scott's films at home, <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the great}} fanfare {{surrounding}} {{her return to}} the Met in early 1951, and her success in resuming her roles there, Flagstad decided {{that it would be}} her final year singing Wagner on the stage. She had gained quite a bit of weight since her pre-war years at the Met when she sang those long and physically demanding roles <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night.</b> In 1950, when she accepted Bing's invitation, she felt she did not have the stamina she had had as a younger woman. She had also developed an arthritic hip in mid-1951 (and had to consult doctors in New York); this further made the operatic stage difficult for her, especially when singing Wagner. She gave her farewell operatic performance at the Met on 1 April 1952, not as Brünnhilde or Isolde but in the title role of Gluck's Alceste, a role she had learnt in the war years in Norway. In London she appeared as Dido (another recently learnt role) in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas at the Mermaid Theatre (in the 1951 Festival of Britain season): the portrayal was recorded (in studio), and issued by EMI in January 1953 (see: Recordings). Her last operatic appearance was as Dido in Oslo on June 5, 1953.|$|E
50|$|Hidden {{behind the}} herb {{garden of the}} castle, there is a {{fountain}} of youth.

The one who succeeded became rejuvenated to the age she had been on the night of her wedding. It is not known if this tradition is still being practiced these days.|$|R

500|$|By {{listening}} to Chapman preach <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night,</b> Sunday received a valuable course in homiletics. Chapman also critiqued Sunday's own attempts at evangelistic preaching {{and showed him}} how to put a good sermon together. Further, Chapman encouraged Sunday's theological development, especially by emphasizing the importance of prayer and by helping to [...] "reinforce Billy's commitment to conservative biblical Christianity." ...|$|E
500|$|Weinberg {{once again}} {{hit the road}} with Springsteen and the E Street Band for The River Tour 2016 in January 2016, which in its various phases lasted until February 2017. He {{appreciated}} the shows on {{the first leg of}} the tour, where they played the entire 20-song The River album in sequence, because [...] "when you play something <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night</b> you really get to dig into the material, just as an instrumentalist." [...] He attributed his ability to keep playing during some of the longest shows in E Street Band history to his keeping in top physical condition, including exercise by swimming, and to his love of playing with Springsteen.|$|E
500|$|Following Stoltz's departure, Fox's {{schedule}} during weekdays {{consisted of}} filming Family Ties during the day, and Back to the Future from 6:30 pm to 2:30 am. He averaged {{five hours of}} sleep each night. During Fridays, he shot from 10 pm to 6 or 7 am, and {{then moved on to}} film exterior scenes throughout the weekend, as only then was he available during daytime hours. Fox found it exhausting, but [...] "it was my dream to be in the film and television business, although I didn't know I'd be in them simultaneously. It was just this weird ride and I got on." [...] Zemeckis concurred, dubbing Back to the Future [...] "the film that would not wrap". He recalled that because they shot <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night,</b> he was always [...] "half asleep" [...] and the [...] "fattest, most out-of-shape and sick I ever was".|$|E

50|$|The Brown family {{makes all}} of their ice cream from scratch and has a hand in {{every step of the}} process. They start by {{creating}} their own ice cream mix by heating skim milk, gelatin, cream, and sugar in a large industrial mixer. The ice cream is then pasteurized and homogenized and eventually stored for a <b>night.</b> <b>After</b> that <b>night</b> storage, the Brown family packages their ice cream and stores it again in a large walk in freezer until it is shipped out.|$|R
50|$|By Tuesday <b>night,</b> <b>after</b> two <b>nights</b> of rioting, {{the curfew}} reduced the disorder; only {{isolated}} incidents {{of violence and}} 33 arrests were reported on the third night of rioting. Hundreds of police officers descended onto the neighborhood to enforce the 7:00 pm curfew and curb violence. Although there were some reports of rock and bottle throwing, no stores were looted or fires set. Most {{people in the area}} stayed in their homes, afraid of being arrested for breaking the curfew. The riot was essentially over.|$|R
500|$|In {{his rookie}} season, Bosh {{was forced to}} play out of {{position}} as the Raptors' starting center after Antonio Davis {{was traded to the}} Chicago Bulls. <b>Night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night,</b> the teenager with the [...] "slim frame" [...] battled against opponents who had a significant size and strength advantage over him. Bosh—who cited teammate Michael Curry as his mentor—was often praised by his coaches for his heart, and willingness to play through pain and injuries resulting from his lack of body strength compared to some of the league's strong forwards and centers. Bosh's contributions were not unnoticed by teammates either, as he averaged 11.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and 33.5 minutes in 75 games, leading all rookies in rebounding and blocks, and setting a franchise record for most rebounds in a rookie season with 557. Bosh was rewarded by being selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 2003–04 season.|$|E
500|$|The Never Ending Tour {{commenced}} on June 7, 1988, and Dylan {{has played}} roughly 100 dates {{a year for}} the entirety of the 1990s and 2000s—a heavier schedule than most performers who started out in the 1960s. By May 2013, Dylan and his band had played more than 2,500 shows, anchored by long-time bassist Tony Garnier, drummer George Recile, multi-instrumentalist Donnie Herron, and guitarist Charlie Sexton. To the dismay of some of his audience, Dylan's performances remain unpredictable as he alters his arrangements and changes his vocal approach <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night.</b> Critical opinion about Dylan's shows remains divided. Critics such as Richard Williams and Andy Gill have argued that Dylan has found a successful way to present his rich legacy of material. Others have criticized his live performances for mangling and spitting out [...] "the greatest lyrics ever written so that they are effectively unrecognisable", and giving so little to the audience that [...] "it is difficult to understand what he is doing on stage at all." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the opening}} {{months of the}} war, Capper busied himself with organising the new {{division}} placed under his command; the work involved in this task meant that the division was not ready for action until October 1914. [...] On 6 October 7th Division arrived at Zeebrugge just as the German forces began to push into that area {{as part of the}} [...] "Race for the Sea". Initially forced back, Capper's division covered the Belgian withdrawal to the Yser and then held the line near the town of Ypres. For the next two months, the 7th Division was embroiled in bitter fighting at the First Battle of Ypres, when they were crucial in stopping the German advance but lost over 10,000 men. The Times later stated that [...] "no one but Capper himself could, <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night,</b> by the sheer force of his personality, have reconstituted from the shattered fragments of battalions a fighting line that could last through tomorrow". For the service he and his men provided during the battle, Capper was awarded a knighthood as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in early 1915.|$|E

500|$|From 2000 to 2001, she starred as Anna Leonowens in {{a revival}} of Rodgers and Hammerstein's The King and I at the London Palladium. Paige had turned down an offer for the role {{the first time she}} was approached, but later accepted, admitting that she had [...] "forgotten what a fantastic score it was", {{although}} she did question her own suitability for the role. Before the opening, the box office had already taken in excess of £7million in ticket sales. [...] The critic for The Independent commented, [...] "It may well be impossible to be a success as Evita and a success as Anna" [...] complaining that Paige was not refined enough for the role, whereas The Spectator asserted that the role further strengthened her title as the [...] "First Lady of British Musical Theatre". During her time in The King and I, her mother was diagnosed with cancer. Despite Paige wanting {{to pull out of the}} show, her mother insisted that she should continue until her contract had finished, and Paige's sister, Marion Billings, admitted, [...] "That was very hard for Elaine, having to go on stage <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night</b> knowing she wanted to be with Mum".|$|E
500|$|According to Jessie Schiewe of Respect., {{the lyrics}} also imply that Azalea [...] "was swindled and take {{advantage}} of in her first record deal", and that it provides insight into events that have toughened Azalea up. While Cristina Jaleru of The Associated Press deduced that the lyrics [...] "First deal changed me, robbed blind, basically raped me / Studied the Carters till a deal was offered, slept cold on the floor recording," [...] are rapped [...] "not as a complaint but as a badge of honor". Nick Aveling of Time Out writes that Azalea is depicted as a [...] "hustler" [...] and a [...] "woman with immense ambition" [...] in the song. In a NPR publication, Ann Powers viewed the lyrics to be of [...] "unremitting toil", as well as detailing a story of Azalea [...] "staying up <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night</b> to master her flow". John Lucas of The Georgia Straight compared the lyrical content to that of Drake's [...] "Started from the Bottom" [...] (2013). According to Matt Jost of RapReviews.com, [...] "Work" [...] is similar to the works of 2 Live Crew and is a [...] "nod to Miami's music history".|$|E
500|$|Although it {{was common}} {{knowledge}} that the Old Vic triumvirate had been dismissed, they refused to be drawn on the matter in public, and Olivier even arranged to play a final London season with the company in 1949, as RichardIII, Sir Peter Teazle, and Chorus in his own production of Anouilh's Antigone with Leigh in the title role. After that, {{he was free to}} embark on a new career as an actor-manager. In partnership with Binkie Beaumont he staged the English premiere of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire, with Leigh in the central role of Blanche DuBois. The play was condemned by most critics, but the production was a considerable commercial success, and led to Leigh's casting as Blanche in the 1951 film version. Gielgud, who was a devoted friend of Leigh's, doubted whether Olivier was wise to let her play the demanding role of the mentally unstable heroine: [...] " [...] was so very like her, in a way. It must have been a most dreadful strain to do it <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night.</b> She would be shaking and white and quite distraught at the end of it." ...|$|E

50|$|The show Farmclub {{aired on}} the USA Network on Monday <b>nights</b> <b>after</b> WWF Monday <b>Night</b> RAW. However, when RAW moved to TNN in late 2000, Farmclub's core {{audience}} went with it. Farmclub lost their core audience and the venture crumbled. This led to Sev being pushed {{on to the}} Geffen label. Geffen, not having {{an interest in the}} band, took two years to release All These Dreams. Once the album came out in 2002, Geffen announced it had no other plans for the band and stopped all communication.|$|R
50|$|The film {{opens with}} a scene of a wealthy young man (Chaplin) {{arriving}} at his house in a taxi late at <b>night</b> <b>after</b> a <b>night</b> of heavy drinking. He struggles with the car door when exiting the car and then in paying the taxi driver (Albert Austin). When he gets to his front door, he thinks that he has forgotten the key and has to enter through the window. While climbing in through the window, he steps into a fishbowl that's placed underneath it and then almost falls down when the carpet underneath him slides. After finding his balance again, he goes through his pockets and realises that the key has been there all the while. He goes back {{through the window and}} enters through the front door.|$|R
500|$|We paid our {{shilling}} at the gate, {{and then}} we saw for the first time, that the entrance, {{if there had been}} any magic about it at all, was now decidedly disenchanted, being, in fact, nothing more nor less than a combination of very roughly-painted boards and sawdust. We glanced at the orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past—we just recognised them, and that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at least, we should not be disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre, and daubs of crimson and yellow all round, like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night</b> we had beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of Madame Somebody (we forget even her name now), who nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine her temple! ...|$|E
500|$|Smith's first {{release for}} DreamWorks was later that year. Titled XO, it was {{conceived}} and developed while Smith wrote it {{out over the}} winter of 1997/1998, <b>night</b> <b>after</b> <b>night</b> seated at the bar in Luna Lounge. It was produced by the team of Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock. XO also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians Joey Waronker and Jon Brion. It contained a more full-sounding, baroque pop sound {{than any of his}} previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, Chamberlins, elaborate string arrangements, and even a drum loop on the song [...] "Independence Day". His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style were still apparent while his somewhat personal lyrical style survived. The album went on to peak at number 104 on the Billboard 200 and number 123 on the UK Album Charts, while selling 400,000 copies (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career. Smith's backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group Quasi, consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes's ex-wife Janet Weiss on drums. Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour, with Smith sometimes contributing bass guitar, guitar, or backing vocals. On October 17, 1998, Smith appeared on Saturday Night Live and performed [...] "Waltz #2 (XO)". His backing band for this appearance was John Moen, Jon Brion, Rob Schnapf, and Sam Coomes.|$|E
500|$|Mae West {{had already}} {{established}} {{herself as a}} comedic performer when her 1926 Broadway show Sex made national headlines. Tried and convicted of indecency by the New York City District Attorney, she served eight days in prison. West carefully constructed a stage persona and carried it over into her interviews and personal appearances. Despite her voluptuous physique, most of her appeal lay in her suggestive manner. She became a wordsmith {{in the art of}} the come-on and the seductive line, and despite her obvious appeal to male audiences, was popular with women as well. Over the cries of the censors, West got her start in the film <b>Night</b> <b>After</b> <b>Night</b> (1932), which starred George Raft and Constance Cummings, as a Texas Guinan-esque supporting character. She agreed to appear in the film only after producers agreed to let her write her own lines. In West's first line on film, after a hat check girl remarks [...] "Goodness, what beautiful diamonds", West replies, [...] "Goodness {{had nothing to do with}} it, dearie." [...] Raft, who had wanted Texas Guinan herself for the role that went to West, later wrote, [...] "In this picture, Mae West stole everything but the cameras." [...] She went on to make She Done Him Wrong in 1933, which became a huge box office hit, grossing $3 million against a $200,000 budget, and then nine months later wrote and starred in I'm No Angel. She became such a success that her career saved Paramount from financial ruin.|$|E

I prayed with deepest sincerity. I cried out to God to overlook my doubts {{in the name of}} Maureen. I willingly suspended all disbelief. At that time and in that place, I was once again a believer. I believed because I wanted to believe that if there was any justice in the universe — any at all — this sweet, loving, smart, responsible, devoted, caring spirit did not deserve to be in a shattered body. A just and loving God who had the power to heal, would surely heal Maureen. He didn't.
