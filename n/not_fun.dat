5|$|The team {{considered}} {{utilizing the}} PlayStation Move controller for casting spells in the game, {{in a similar}} fashion {{to the use of the}} touchscreen in the DS version, though ultimately decided against it as it would limit the potential sales. The battle system was revised over ten times, in order to achieve something new and unique. For about a year of development, the battle system used a turn-based system, though this was ultimately changed when the team felt that it was <b>not</b> <b>fun</b> for players. The team eventually merged turn-based combat and action elements, popular in Japanese and Western regions, respectively, in order to appeal to both regions.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, Evra was {{recruited}} by Nice's Derby de la Côte d'Azur rivals Monaco. Despite wanting {{to play as}} a left winger again, Evra was advised by manager Didier Deschamps he would only play as a left back. Evra has since credited Deschamps for allowing {{him to become a}} better defender after initially describing the role as being <b>not</b> <b>fun.</b> Evra was inserted into a back four that consisted of centre-backs Rafael Márquez and Sébastien Squillaci and right-back Franck Jurietti. Evra was assigned the number 3 shirt and made his debut for the club in the opening match of the 2002–03 season against Troyes. He played the entire match in a 4–0 win. On 28 September, Evra scored his first goal for the club, scoring the match-winner in a 2–1 victory against Rennes. On 22 March 2003, he scored his second goal of the season in a 3–0 away win over Le Havre. The victory allowed Monaco to maintain its position {{at the top of the}} table, as the club was in a three-way battle with Lyon and Marseille. Monaco climatically conceded first place to Lyon in May, which resulted in Lyon being declared champions for the second time in its history. Monaco finished the campaign in second place, which merited the club an appearance in the UEFA Champions League. The club was also rewarded domestically for its performance in the Coupe de la Ligue where it reached the final. Evra featured in the team's 4–1 win over Sochaux in the match. The league cup title gave Evra the first major honour of his career.|$|E

500|$|The {{violence}} {{that was much}} criticized in 1969 remains controversial. Peckinpah noted it was allegoric of the American war in Vietnam, the violence of which was nightly televised to American homes at supper time. He tried showing the gun violence commonplace to the historic western frontier period, rebelling against sanitized, bloodless television Westerns and films glamorizing gunfights and murder: [...] "The point {{of the film is}} to take this façade of movie violence and open it up, get people involved in it so that they are starting to go in the Hollywood television predictable reaction syndrome, and then twist it so that it's <b>not</b> <b>fun</b> anymore, just a wave of sickness in the gut ... it's ugly, brutalizing, and bloody awful; it's <b>not</b> <b>fun</b> and games and cowboys and Indians. It's a terrible, ugly thing, and yet there's a certain response that you get from it, an excitement, because we're all violent people." [...] Peckinpah used violence as a catharsis, believing his audience would be purged of violence by witnessing it explicitly on screen. He later admitted to being mistaken, that the audience came to enjoy rather than be horrified by his films' violence, something that troubled him.|$|E

500|$|Some {{aspects of}} the game were criticized, however. Writing for Destructoid, Jim Sterling {{described}} Sonic Colors as [...] "terribly designed".

Gies, Hernandez, Meyer, Turi, and Keast criticized the game's high difficulty level, with Keast going as far to describe it as [...] "hardcore".

500|$|In 1995, Green Day {{released}} Insomniac, {{which did}} not perform as well commercially as the band's breakthrough major-label debut Dookie (1994).

[...] The group embarked on an extensive world tour to promote Insomniac in early 1996, which saw the band performing in sports arenas that contrasted with the small clubs the group was accustomed to playing. [...] The members became increasingly uncomfortable with the level of stardom they had attained; Armstrong recalled, [...] "We were becoming the things we hated, playing those big arenas.

500|$|AllGame editor Brett Alan Weiss's {{retrospective}} {{review was}} critical {{as he called}} Slalom [...] "a rush job" [...] that did not capture the spirit of skiing. He felt that the game was repetitive, too simple, and <b>not</b> <b>fun</b> for adults. Weiss described the graphics as blocky and insipid, the sound as repetitive and derivative. He said that {{even though it was}} an early release in the console's lifespan, Slalom was on par with the 1979 Intellivision's capabilities. He recommended Konami's Antarctic Adventure for the ColecoVision in its stead. UK-based magazine Retro Gamer wrote that the game received little fanfare. The magazine's Stuart Hunt wrote in December2010, on Rare's 25th anniversary, that the game was [...] "fun but quite simplistic" [...] in its lack of race variety. He said, though, that the game showcased how the company could maximize the system resources of the NES.

500|$|While Insomniac was {{handling}} {{the development of}} the Ratchet & Clank franchise, the team wanted to work on something else. With the launch of the PlayStation 3, the team thought users of the new console would be more mature than those of its predecessors and wanted to develop a game to cater for them. They also thought the studio should not specialize in one genre. This new project was part of Insomniac's expansion; the company wanted to have multiple projects in parallel development. This project began development after the completion of Deadlocked. The team agreed to develop something different for a different platform. Inspired by Starship Troopers, [...] was Insomniac's first first-person shooter after Disruptor. To make the game stand-out, they experimented with turning it into a squad-based shooter and introducing giant lizard enemies which were later scrapped. Sony recommended Insomniac to change its lizard antagonist because they were <b>not</b> <b>fun</b> to play with. Furthermore, the team disgreed about the game's setting.|$|E
500|$|Actor Jim Beaver {{described}} Bobby as a [...] "rough but warmhearted" [...] working-class {{man with}} the outlook that [...] "sometimes {{there are things that}} need to be done and they're <b>not</b> <b>fun</b> to do, but they gotta be done anyway". When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead of being able to join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous things might happen to him. I think he is also a realist. He understands that even when you have friends that come back from the dead, not everything that you want to happen is going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|The use of {{a safety}} car to start the race had a mixed {{response}} within the sport.

Schumacher, Petrov, Sutil and Buemi also agreed with the decision to start under safety-car conditions. Hamilton said he felt the length of time under safety-car conditions was not [...] "good for the spectators and it's <b>not</b> <b>fun</b> for the drivers". He additionally felt the track was dry enough for a normal restart. BBC commentator and former driver Martin Brundle said he felt the race should have started at an earlier time, while Button said he thought the event should have been stopped before visibility became poor. Nevertheless, the Grand Prix was awarded the Race Promoters Trophy at the FIA Gala Awards held in Monte Carlo in December 2010.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} praised Storm of Zehirs {{use of the}} Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition rules {{with the}} exception of GameSpy, who expressed skepticism of the ruleset in a preview of the game. [...] The game's handling of character death was not well received, [...] despite being more faithful to the pencil and paper version than previous Dungeons & Dragons video games. [...] Unlike Neverwinter Nights 2 and Mask of the Betrayer where defeated characters would be automatically revived after a battle, Storm of Zehir requires a powerful spell or a [...] "Coin of Waukeen" [...] to resurrect dead allies. [...] Reviewers considered this requirement unforgiving; GameSpy said [...] "This merely forces the player to troop back to town through a zillion meaningless random encounters. This may be [...] "realistic" [...] (whatever that means in a world where players fight against newborn gods and sentient snakes), but it's simply <b>not</b> <b>fun.</b> Baldur's Gate had this all worked out over a decade ago.

There's nothing really much to say. You know, the music essentially stopped in 1970. [...] And, you know, I mean, quite honestly, we don't get along. So it's not like it's fun.

500|$|Developers {{originally}} intended for players to be permanently {{out of a}} race when falling far off a track, however they {{came to realize that}} it was <b>not</b> <b>fun</b> for players [...] "to be forced to go slow or suffer an instant defeat."

[...] In the end the decision was made to simply respawn the character on the track. The PC version was ported in large part by John Olsen, who worked on the port as his first task at SingleTrac. [...] The PC version also features 3Dfx hardware acceleration, which allows for higher resolution gameplay and visual enhancements such as reflective water.

500|$|Valve {{aimed for}} a November 1997 release {{to compete with}} Quake II. By September 1997, the team found that while they had built a number of {{innovative}} aspects in weapons, enemies, and level design, the game was <b>not</b> <b>fun</b> and there was little design cohesion. The company postponed the release and reworked every level. They took a novel approach of assigning a small team to build a prototype level containing every element in the game, and then spent a month iterating on the level. When {{the rest of the}} team played the level, which designer Ken Birdwell described as [...] "Die Hard meets Evil Dead", they agreed to use it as a baseline. The team developed three theories about what made the level fun. First, the level had a number of interesting things happen in it and all when the player came into near proximity of the event, rather than based on time elements, so that the player would set the pace of the level. Second, the level had means to respond to any player action, even for something as simple as adding graphic decals to wall textures to show a bullet impact. Finally, the level warned the player of imminent danger to allow them to avoid it, rather than killing the player with no warning.|$|E
