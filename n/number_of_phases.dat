25|$|Cobalt-based {{catalysts}} {{are highly}} active, although iron {{may be more}} suitable for certain applications. Cobalt catalysts are more active for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis when the feedstock is natural gas. Natural gas has a high hydrogen to carbon ratio, so the water-gas-shift is not needed for cobalt catalysts. Iron catalysts are preferred for lower quality feedstocks such as coal or biomass. Synthesis gases derived from these hydrogen-poor feedstocks has a low-hydrogen-content and require the water–gas shift reaction. Unlike the other metals used for this process (Co, Ni, Ru), which remain in the metallic state during synthesis, iron catalysts tend to form a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>phases,</b> including various oxides and carbides during the reaction. Control of these phase transformations can be important in maintaining catalytic activity and preventing breakdown of the catalyst particles.|$|E

25|$|Another {{constantly}} changing aspect was the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>phases</b> in the game. Initially, in 2005, the game consisted of seven phases: Cell, Underwater, Creature, Tribe, City, Civilization and Space. During the annual Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences DICE Summit on February 7, 2007, a slide was displayed (see image, right) which listed {{a total of}} eight phases. The Underwater phase had been removed, and Molecular was added (which was likened to Tetris). Furthermore, the Space phase was split into Terraform and Galactic phases; terraforming represented a limited form of power to slowly change planets within one's own system, whilst the galactic phase represented a more god-like power upon the acquisition of the interstellar space drive: being able to travel outside of one's solar system. The 2007 TED seminar in March 2007 displayed only five phases. The Molecular and Cellular phases had been condensed into one Cell phase. The City stage had been removed, and from Wright's demonstration {{it appears that the}} stage has been assimilated into the start of the Civilization phase. Furthermore, the two last phases were condensed back into the single Space phase.|$|E

40|$|Speckle {{interferometry}} is a {{well established}} technique for the optical characterization of rough objects, with the quantification of deformations as one particular application of interest. Owing to its common path property, a speckle-shearing interferometer is often the natural choice as a setup. Like other speckle techniques, however, speckle-shearing interferometry suffers from the existence <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> singularities present in the speckle patterns. Phase singularities introduce ambiguities into the phase unwrapping process and make this evaluation step highly sophisticated. In this work, we attempt to reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> singularities by physical means, i. e. by applying an incoherent averaging of multiple, mutually independent speckle intensities. The effect of the incoherent averaging on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> singularities has been investigated theoretically, by computer simulations, and experimentally To obtain high contrast fringes {{in connection with a}} shearing setup, which would not be the case for a simple extended light source, a periodically structured light source with a period matched to the shear distance is applied.
