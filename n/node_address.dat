50|$|With this naming structure, {{support for}} {{mobility}} and multi-homing is inherent, if the properties for {{the names are}} chosen with care: application names are location-independent to allow an application to move around, <b>node</b> <b>addresses</b> are location-dependent but route-independent. PoA addresses are by nature route-dependent. Applying this naming scheme to RINA, with recursive layers, an interesting observation can be made: mapping application names to <b>node</b> <b>addresses</b> is the same mapping than mapping <b>node</b> <b>addresses</b> to PoAs. In other words, for any layer N, nodes at the layer N+1 are applications and nodes at the layer N-1 are points of attachment, making this relationship relative.|$|R

50|$|An {{open-source}} social VPN implementation {{based on}} the Facebook social network service and the Brunet P2P overlay is available for Windows and Linux systems under MIT license. It creates direct point-to-point secure connections between computers {{with the help of}} online social networks, and supports transparent traversal of NATs. It uses the P2P overlay to create direct VPN connections between pairs of computers (nodes). To establish a connection, two nodes advertise their P2P <b>node</b> <b>address</b> (as well as public keys for secure communication) to each other through an online social network. Once each node acquires the <b>node</b> <b>address</b> (and public keys) of the other node, an IP-to-nodeAddress mapping is created and IP packets can be routed through the VPN tunnel.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes and {{analyzes}} {{modifications to}} the Landmark routing system that make it better suited to large ad hoc wireless networks. Most existing ad hoc routing algorithms scale badly {{in the sense that}} they generate protocol overhead whose per-node cost grows linearly with the total number of nodes. The Landmark routing protocol solves this problem by use of hierarchical addresses that contain routing hints; as a result, however, a <b>node's</b> <b>address</b> changes as the network topology changes. The Landmark system tracks <b>node</b> <b>addresses</b> with a distributed ID-to-address location service, but queries to this service require communication with random non-local nodes, which scales badly in large networks.

50|$|The {{addresses}} were of just 14 bits {{length to}} address both, the routers (called nodes by then) and the devices connected to them. They were formed by two fields, an 8-bit field {{to address the}} router and a sub-address of 6 bit to address the terminals connected to it. The <b>node</b> <b>address</b> was assigned to nodes {{and not to the}} ends of the links as in Internet.|$|E
50|$|A big {{advantage}} of IPX protocol is its {{little or no}} need for configuration. In the time when protocols for dynamic host configuration did not exist and the BOOTP protocol for centralized assigning of addresses was not common, the IPX network could be configured almost automatically. A client computer uses the MAC address of its network card as the <b>node</b> <b>address,</b> and learns what it needs {{to know about the}} network topology from the servers or routers - routes are propagated by Routing Information Protocol, services by Service Advertising Protocol.|$|E
50|$|The IPX network {{number is}} conceptually {{identical}} to the network part of the IP address (the parts with netmask bits set to 1); the node number has the same meaning as the bits of IP address with netmask bits set to 0. The {{difference is that the}} boundary between network and node part of address in IP is variable, while in IPX it is fixed. As the <b>node</b> <b>address</b> is usually {{identical to the}} MAC address of the network adapter, the Address Resolution Protocol is not needed in IPX.|$|E

5000|$|In 1982, Jerry Saltzer in {{his work}} “On the Naming and Binding of network destinations” [...] {{described}} the entities and the relationships that make a complete naming and addressing schema in networks. According to Saltzer four are the elements {{that need to be}} identified: applications, nodes, points of attachment to the network (PoA) and paths. An application can run in one or more nodes and should be able to move from one node to another without losing its identity in the network. A node can be connected to a pair of PoAs and should be able to move between them without losing its identity in the network. A directory maps an application name to a <b>node</b> <b>address,</b> and routes are sequences of nodes addresses and point of attachments.|$|E
50|$|SCI sends {{information}} in packets. Each packet {{consists of an}} unbroken sequence of 16-bit symbols. The symbol {{is accompanied by a}} flag bit. A transition of the flag bit from 0 to 1 indicates the start of a packet. A transition from 1 to 0 occurs 1 (for echoes) or 4 symbols before the packet end. A packet contains a header with address command and status information, payload (from 0 through optional lengths of data) and a CRC check symbol. The first symbol in the packet header contains the destination <b>node</b> <b>address.</b> If the address is not within the domain handled by the receiving node, the packet is passed to the output through the bypass FIFO. In the other case, the packet is fed to a receive queue and may be transferred to a ring in another dimension. All packets are marked when they pass the scrubber (a node is established as scrubber when the ring is initialized). Packets without a valid destination address will be removed when passing the scrubber for the second time to avoid filling the ring with packets that would otherwise circulate indefinitely.|$|E
5000|$|The worm {{propagated}} {{through the}} network pseudo-randomly from one {{system to the}} other by using an algorithm which converted the victim machine's system time into a candidate target <b>node</b> <b>address</b> (composed of a DECnet Area and Node number) and subsequently attempted to exploit weakly secured accounts such as SYSTEM and DECNET that had password identical to the usernames. The worm did not attack computers within DECnet area 48, which was New Zealand. A comment inside the worm source code {{at the point of}} this branch logic indicated that New Zealand was a nuclear free zone. New Zealand had recently forbidden U.S. nuclear-powered vessels from docking at its harbours, thus further fueling the speculation inside NASA that the worm attack was related to the anti-nuclear protest. The line [...] "You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war" [...] is drawn from the lyrics of the Midnight Oil song [...] "Blossom and Blood". Midnight Oil are an Australian rock band known for their political activism and opposition to both nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The process name of the second version of the worm to be detected was [...] "oilz", an Australian shorthand term for the band.|$|E
5000|$|The Bosch CAN {{specification}} itself allows messages being transmitted both periodically and aperiodically {{but does}} not cover issues like data representation, <b>node</b> <b>addressing</b> or connection-oriented protocols. CAN is entirely based on Anyone-to-Many (ATM) communication which means that CAN messages are always received by all stations in the network. The advantage of the CAN concept is inherent data consistency between all stations, the drawback {{is that it does}} not allow <b>node</b> <b>addressing</b> which is the basis for Peer-to-Peer (PTP) communication. Using CAN networks in aeronautical applications, however, demands a standard targeted to the specific requirements of airborne systems which implies that communication between individual stations in the network must be possible to enable the required degree of system monitoring. Consequently, CANaerospace defines additional ISO/OSI layer 3, 4 and 6 functions to support <b>node</b> <b>addressing</b> and unified ATM/PTP communication mechanisms. PTP communication allows to set up client/server interactions between individual stations in the network either temporarily or permanently. More than one of these interactions may be in effect at any given time and each node may be client for one operation and server for another at the same time. This CANaerospace mechanism is called [...] "Node Service Concept" [...] and allows i.e. to distribute system functions over several stations in the network or to control dynamic system reconfiguration in case of failure. The Node Service concept supports both connection-oriented and connectionless interactions like with TCP/IP and UDP/IP for Ethernet.|$|R
