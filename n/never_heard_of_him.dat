25|$|A highly {{positive}} {{review was}} purportedly {{written by a}} critic named David Manning, who was credited to The Ridgefield Press, a small Connecticut weekly news publication. During an investigation into Manning's quotes, Newsweek reporter John Horn discovered that the newspaper had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The story emerged at {{around the same time}} as an announcement that Sony had used employees posing as moviegoers in television commercials to praise the film. These occurrences, in tandem, raised questions and controversy about ethics in movie marketing practices.|$|E
25|$|UKIP {{has several}} {{high-profile}} backers. In March 2009, the Conservative Party's biggest-ever donor, Stuart Wheeler, donated £100,000 to UKIP after criticising Cameron's stance towards the Treaty of Lisbon. He was then {{expelled from the}} Conservatives and in 2011 appointed treasurer of UKIP. In October 2014, Arron Banks, who previously gave £25,000 to the Conservatives, increased his UKIP donation from £100,000 to £1 million after Hague said he had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The multi-millionaire Paul Sykes has helped finance the party, donating over £1 million to their 2014 campaign at the European Parliament.|$|E
2500|$|After being unopposed in the 2016 Republican primary, Price faced Democratic {{challenger}} Rodney Stooksbury in {{the general}} election. Stooksbury, {{said to be a}} retired aeronautic, was described by the media as a [...] "ghost candidate", as he had no public photographs, official website, or social media presence. When CBS46 sent a reporter to his listed address, there was no answer, and Stooksbury's supposed neighbors had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The Stooksbury campaign spent a mere $346. Despite the handicap of possibly not existing, Stooksbury performed better than any of his predecessors - Price won the election, but only carried 61% of the vote.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{asked the}} man {{who came to the}} door for the [...] "depite," [...] he shook his head, and said, [...] "I dunno 'im. There ain't no such a person 'ere. I <b>never</b> <b>'eard</b> <b>of</b> <b>'im</b> in all my bloomin' days. Don't believe there ain't nobody of that kind livin' 'ere or anywheres." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The idiot!" [...] {{said her}} Ladyship, {{thinking}} of Mr. Tollmidge, [...] "I <b>never</b> even <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> in my husband's lifetime; I never even {{knew that he}} was really related to Lord Lydiard, till I found his letters. What is to be done next?" ...|$|R
25|$|His {{success with}} {{assistant}} manager Tom Chadney {{by his side}} {{attracted the attention of}} much larger clubs, and Eriksson was appointed manager of IFK Göteborg on 1 January 1979. The move was such a surprise that many of the players had <b>never</b> even <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Sometime during August 2011, Parks was {{contacted}} by electronic musician Skrillex for orchestral arrangements. Parks elaborated in 2013, [...] "When Skrillex called me up, I'd <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> I pretended I {{knew who he}} was. [...] "'Send me the piece, and if I feel able, I'll do it.' I don't have any hobbies, you know. I love music; I do it [...] And he said, 'Oh, thank you, Mr. Parks. We will destroy the world.' I said, 'Okay...' I Google him and there he is, on YouTube, in front of 30,000 people, pouring beer onto a laptop computer, {{at which point the}} crowd jumps into the mosh pit and has an erection.…I have two things I can do: Run away from all this in horror because I’m so superior, or dig in and serve and try to bring hope to the hopeless. That can be done behind the curtain, and that’s where I’m very comfortable working.…I treat every job {{as if it were the}} very thing that will define me. Nothing is beneath me. I think that is evident to people who ask my best." [...] His arranging work was released in December 2011 as the iTunes-exclusive bonus track [...] "Skrillex Orchestral Suite by Varien" [...] on the Bangarang EP.|$|E
60|$|SIR PATRICK. Bernard Shaw? I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> He's a Methodist preacher, I suppose.|$|E
60|$|LUBIN. Savvy! I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Tell me {{all about}} him. Keep me up to date.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} he did then, though he spoke of his poor condition. But {{on the next day}} he went away. We heard that he had taken the steamer down the river for New Orleans. We have <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> more <b>of</b> <b>him</b> from that day to this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was a cross-grained fellow," [...] {{returned}} the mate, [...] "specially when in liquor, but I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> no worse <b>of</b> <b>'im</b> than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure, I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> tell <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> Mister Percy; and if I {{have been}} bad tempered, I haven't said much about it; {{and if the}} {{carpenter}} had a wad of cotton {{as big as a}} cricket ball in one cheek, as I have, it's small blame to him if he was out of temper." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{made another}} shameful confession. Either I had {{forgotten}} Lord Uppercliff, during my long absence abroad, or I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|VOICES: (Sighing) So he's gone. Ah yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? <b>Never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Prince Marvel?" [...] exclaimed the Baron. [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Does he {{come from}} the Kingdom of Dawna, or that of Auriel, or Plenta?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And he {{is all in}} {{travelling}} trim, [...] And by the moonlight, Betty Foy [...] Has up {{upon the}} saddle set, [...] The like was <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> yet, [...] <b>Him</b> whom she loves, her idiot boy.|$|R
60|$|Pawnee Brown {{rushed to}} the barn door. Far away he saw Powell Dike running as though the old Nick was after him. A second later the rascal {{disappeared}} from view. The boomer <b>never</b> saw or <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> again.|$|R
60|$|When I {{closed the}} last leaf of the Count's {{manuscript}} the half-hour during which I had engaged {{to remain at}} Forest Road had expired. Monsieur Rubelle {{looked at his watch}} and bowed. I rose immediately, and left the agent in possession of the empty house. I never saw <b>him</b> again--I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> more <b>of</b> <b>him</b> or <b>of</b> his wife. Out of the dark byways of villainy and deceit they had crawled across our path--into the same byways they crawled back secretly and were lost.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{the doctor}} on board?" [...] he cried {{as he came}} up. [...] "Dr. Symonds, I mean? You <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him?</b> Nor yet of the Trinity Hall? Ah!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a boxer. Still, {{he seems}} {{very anxious to}} go down, and he {{certainly}} has one remarkable testimonial, and as there's no one else--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} him before!" [...] cried Olive. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> I don't {{understand}} anything about it. The whole thing shocked me, and I wanted to get on." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although his {{knowledge}} and teaching has influenced yoga throughout the world, Krishnamacharya never left his native India. Yoga Journal said that: [...] You may <b>never</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> but Tirumalai Krishnamacharya influenced {{or perhaps even}} invented your yoga. Whether you practice the dynamic series of Pattabhi Jois, the refined alignments of B. K. S. Iyengar, the classical postures of Indra Devi, or the customized vinyasa of Viniyoga, your practice stems from one source: a five-foot, two-inch Brahmin born {{more than one hundred}} years ago in a small South Indian village.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I think I {{scared him}} pretty well when I {{met him in}} the woods. He'll {{probably}} lay low for a while--at least until he thinks the field is clear again. But I'd give a good deal if I <b>never</b> saw or <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> again," [...] and Dave heaved another sigh.|$|R
6000|$|The ingenious closing {{sentence}} had {{the effect}} of moving me out of bed with despatch that night, and out at the back door also, while the [...] "outraged and insulted public" [...] surged in the front way, breaking furniture and windows in their righteous indignation as they came, and taking off such property as they could carry when they went. And yet I can lay my hand upon the Book and say that I never slandered Mr. Blank's grandfather. More: I had <b>never</b> even <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> or mentioned him up to that day and date.|$|R
60|$|Of course I did not--I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> before; but the {{old lady}} seemed to regard his {{existence}} as a universally understood fact, with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! he {{is a tough}} un," [...] {{observed}} Gaff, with {{a significant}} grin. [...] "I knows him well. He don't much care riskin' fellers' lives, though I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> riskin' his own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet I have <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> Master Lowestoffe," [...] said Lord Glenvarloch; [...] "or, what is {{the same}} thing, I have paid no {{attention}} to aught that may have passed in conversation respecting him." ...|$|E
6000|$|The author {{does not}} mention Saint-Germain, and may <b>never</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> If his account of Major Fraser is not mere romance, in that warrior we have the undying friend of Louis XV. and Madame de Pompadour. He had drunk at Medmenham with Jack Wilkes; as Riccio he had sung duets with the fairest of unhappy queens; he had {{extracted}} from Blanche de Béchamel the secret of Goby de Mouchy. As Pinto, he told much of his secret history to Mr. Thackeray, who says: 'I am rather sorry to lose him after three little bits of Roundabout Papers.' ...|$|R
60|$|To this I {{had nothing}} to reply, unless to object my own incompetency to the task the good father was desirous to impose upon me. On this subject he was pleased to say more, I fear, than his {{knowledge}} of me fully warranted--more, at any rate, than my modesty will permit me to record. At length he ended, with advising me, if I continued to feel the diffidence which I stated, to apply to some veteran of literature, whose experience might supply my deficiencies. Upon these terms we parted, with mutual expressions of regard, and I have <b>never</b> since <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "From some {{circumstances}} that recurred to our memories, we both suspected {{the young man}} who had been in attendance on the prince, but, although we caused the most diligent search to be made, we failed to find him. My friend and I parted soon after. I was sent up to the hills, and <b>never</b> saw or <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> again.|$|R
60|$|Nellie did {{not know}} the fellow; indeed she had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> But there was that in the spy's manner which was not at all reassuring as he leaped down to where she stood.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} I don't know the man. <b>Never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> I thought I knew every uncle on the list, but I can't place this one. However, I suppose I {{shall have to}} meet him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, I {{respect him}} for writing in English. The whole letter is touchingly brave and fine. Confound him! I wish I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> What does he come bothering across my path for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's an {{old friend}} of mine, a very {{distinguished}} man in his day. He gave it to me himself, but I'm afraid to mention his name, lest you <b>never</b> should have <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> critic and historian as you are. I know the world goes fast and one generation forgets another. He was all the fashion when I was young." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray take a seat, Major--Major Clutterbuck," [...] said Mrs. Scully, {{referring}} to his card, which she still held in her very well-formed little hand. [...] "Major-general Scully, did you say? Dear me! I {{know that one of}} my husband's relations went into the army, but we <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> what became <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> A major-general, is he? Whoever would have thought it!" ...|$|R
50|$|After his NBA career, O'Bannon played {{professional}} basketball seven years overseas in Italy, Spain, Greece, Argentina and Poland (in Anwil Włocławek, Polonia Warszawa and Astoria Bydgoszcz). He also played one {{year for the}} startup American Basketball Association (ABA) with the Los Angeles Stars. After the NBA, he only had one-year contracts and never made more than $400,000 in a season. He decided to retire at age 32 after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery. When he made his decision, {{he was in the}} process of trying out for a team in China but realized he had no more motivation to play the game. Furthermore, the people holding the tryouts had <b>never</b> even <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
