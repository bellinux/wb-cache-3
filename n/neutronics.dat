2500|$|Less {{long-lived}} waste. LFTRs can dramatically {{reduce the}} long-term radiotoxicity of their reactor wastes. Light water reactors with uranium fuel have fuel {{that is more}} than 95% U-238. These reactors normally transmute part of the U-238 to Pu-239, a long-lived isotope. Almost all of the fuel is therefore only one step away from becoming a transuranic long-lived element. Plutonium-239 has a half life of 24,000 years, and is the most common transuranic in spent nuclear fuel from light water reactors. Transuranics like Pu-239 cause the perception that reactor wastes are an eternal problem. In contrast, the LFTR uses the thorium fuel cycle, which transmutes thorium to U-233. Because thorium is a lighter element, more neutron captures are required to produce the transuranic elements. U-233 has two chances to fission in a LFTR. First as U-233 (90% will fission) and then the remaining 10% has another chance as it transmutes to U-235 (80% will fission). The fraction of fuel reaching neptunium-237, the most likely transuranic element, is therefore only 2%, about 15kg perGWe-year. This is a transuranic production 20x smaller than light water reactors, which produce 300kg of transuranics per GWe-year. Importantly, because of this much smaller transuranic production, {{it is much easier to}} recycle the transuranics. That is, they are sent back to the core to eventually fission. Reactors operating on the U238-plutonium fuel cycle produce far more transuranics, making full recycle difficult on both reactor <b>neutronics</b> and the recycling system. In the LFTR, only a fraction of a percent, as reprocessing losses, goes to the final waste. When these two benefits of lower transuranic production, and recycling, are combined, a thorium fuel cycle reduces the production of transuranic wastes by more than a thousand-fold compared to a conventional once-through uranium-fueled light water reactor. The only significant long-lived waste is the uranium fuel itself, but this can be used indefinitely by recycling, always generating electricity.If the thorium stage ever has to be shut down, part of the reactors can be shut down and their uranium fuel inventory burned out in the remaining reactors, allowing a burndown of even this final waste to as small a level as society demands. The LFTR does still produce radioactive fission products in its waste, but they don't last very long - the radiotoxicity of these fission products is dominated by cesium-137 and strontium-90. The longer half-life is cesium: 30.17 years. So, after 30.17 years, decay reduces the radioactivity by a half. Ten half-lives will reduce the radioactivity by two raised to a power of ten, a factor of 1,024. Fission products at that point, in about 300 years, are less radioactive than natural uranium. What's more, the liquid state of the fuel material allows separation of the fission products not only from the fuel, but from each other as well, which enables them to be sorted by the length of each fission product's half-life, so that the ones with shorter half-lives can be brought out of storage sooner than those with longer half-lives.|$|E

50|$|Since steep {{temperature}} gradients will {{be present in}} any such gas core reactor, several implications for <b>neutronics</b> must be considered. The open-cycle gas-core reactor (OCGCR) is typically a thermal/epithermal reactor. Most types of OCGCR require external moderation due to the steep {{temperature gradients}} inside the gaseous core. Neutrons born in the fuel region travel relatively unimpeded to the external moderator where some are thermalized and sent back into the gas core. Due to the high core temperatures, however, on the return trip the neutrons are up scattered in the fuel region, {{which leads to a}} significant negative reactor worth. To achieve criticality, this reactor is operated at very high pressure and the exterior radial wall is made up of a moderator of some sort, generally beryllium oxide. Moderation can also come from introducing moderating particles into either the fuel or propellant streams, but by doing so, the benefits in <b>neutronics</b> is canceled by loss of rocket performance.|$|E

50|$|According to Hyperion, {{the uranium}} nitride fuel {{incorporated}} in the design is generally similar in physical characteristics and <b>neutronics</b> to the standard ceramic uranium oxide fuel that is used at present in modern light water nuclear reactors. However, it has certain beneficial traits - higher thermal conductivity - and thus less retained heat energy - that make it preferable over oxide fuels when used at temperature regimes that are greater than the 250 to 300 C temperatures found in light water reactors. By operating at higher temperatures, steam plants can operate at a higher thermal efficiency. The presentation by Hyperion at the ANS 2009 conference mentions {{the use of the}} Doppler inherent negative temperature coefficient of reactivity in this reactor as a means of control. Nuclear scientist Alexander Sesonske avers that nitride fuels have both received very little development (as of 1973) and seem to have a very favorable combination of physical properties - especially in fast reactors. Whether this carries over to lead-bismuth cooled reactors is a question not answered in the reviewed literature, though the Soviet Union has worked with this type of reactor before in naval service; in particular, the Alfa class submarine - well known in the West for its high speed operation - was driven by such a lead-bismuth reactor which is known to have worked very effectively.|$|E

40|$|In LWR cores, {{multiple}} fields of physics {{will need to}} be tackled. The power level is determined by the neutron density field, and the generated heat will determine the fuel conditions, which in turn affect the coolant/moderator flow and thermo-physical conditions. As the neutron cross- sections depend on both the fuel and moderator conditions, an interdependence between the <b>neutronics</b> and thermal-hydraulics is found. To perform accurate, high-resolution nuclear reactor core calculations, it is therefore necessary to couple strategies and methodologies from different areas of physics. In this work a finite volume approach is used to perform steady state, coupled calculations for thermal-hydraulics and <b>neutronics</b> on a shared high-resolution mesh. The thermal-hydraulics is solved by a standard CFD approach, using the SIMPLE algorithm for the pressure-velocity coupling together with an energy equation expressed in terms of temperature.

The main purpose of the coupling is to exchange data such as temperature and power profile between both codes.

Besides, the volume of presented information has been increased and additional explications have been included. The results for the reference uranium core [4] are presented in Chapter 2. The results for the core with 3 MOX LTAs are presented in Chapter 3. The conservatism that is connected with <b>neutronics</b> parameters and that {{must be taken into account}} during transient analysis calculations, is discussed in Chapter 4. The conservative parameters values are considered to be used in 1 -point core kinetics models of accident analysis codes...|$|E
40|$|The <b>neutronics</b> {{performance}} of the EVOLVE concept was analyzed using two-dimensional calculations. The vapor fraction in the boiling blanket has a small impact on the nuclear performance parameters. For the worst case condition with the highest predicted vapor fraction distribution, all nuclear performance parameters are acceptable with a comfortable margin. The EVOLVE boiling blanket is expected to perform adequately from the <b>neutronics</b> point of view {{for any of the}} boiling regimes considered. Analysis was performed also for a preliminary design of the transpiration blanket option indicating that it will also have adequate nuclear performance parameters...|$|E
