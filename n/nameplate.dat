5|$|Worldwide {{there are}} now over two hundred {{thousand}} wind turbines operating, with a total <b>nameplate</b> capacity of 432 GW as of end 2015. The European Union alone passed some 100 GW <b>nameplate</b> capacity in September 2012, while the United States surpassed 75 GW in 2015 and China's grid connected capacity passed 145 GW in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, Holden {{announced}} that it would cease its local production by October 2017 committing, however, to use the long-standing Commodore <b>nameplate</b> on its fifth-generation fully imported replacement, moving to a front-wheel drive (FWD) platform.|$|E
5|$|The plant had a peak {{generation}} capability, or <b>nameplate</b> capacity, {{of about}} 400MWe, with design features to allow expansion {{to as much}} as 1000MWe.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a growing}} trend to use <b>nameplates</b> for vanity purposes. In these cases, the <b>nameplates</b> are {{fashioned}} out of gold, silver, or other metals and worn {{as a form of}} jewellery. These <b>nameplates</b> are similar to vanity plates found on automobiles. They are available in a multitude of styles and colors, ranging from bronze to pink. Most commonly, these vanity <b>nameplates</b> are worn as necklaces or bracelets.|$|R
50|$|Graphic overlay <b>nameplates</b> are {{constructed}} from hard-coated polycarbonate, hard-coated polyester or UV resistant polyester. Graphic overlay <b>nameplates</b> differ from generic <b>nameplates</b> {{in that they}} feature transparent windows, selective texturing, embossing, abrasion protection and chemical resistance. A graphic overlay is usually over some sort of LEDs, windows, switch, or control panel.|$|R
50|$|The {{entire class}} {{is named after}} Irish rivers, with the IÉ {{locomotives}} carrying two <b>nameplates,</b> one in Irish and one in English, {{on each side of}} the locomotive. As 8208 and 8209 are owned by Northern Ireland Railways, they carry English language only <b>nameplates.</b> The <b>nameplates</b> are trapezium shaped, with the names in upper case.|$|R
5|$|Some of the {{locomotives}} had additional embellishments. No. 34050 Royal Observer Corps {{was presented}} with an ROC long-service medal in July 1961. The ceremony took place at Waterloo station, and included Commandant ROC Air Commodore Wight-Boycott. The cab side was given {{a representation of the}} medal and its ribbon, which was displayed until the engine was withdrawn from service and scrapped in the late 1960s. The original <b>nameplate</b> and crest were recovered and displayed in the entrance hall of ROC Headquarters at RAF Bentley Priory until 1996 when they were transferred to the RAF Museum at Hendon. Another locomotive that featured a second crest was 34067 Tangmere, which was given the airfield's crest for the cab side, as it did not feature on the <b>nameplate</b> crest.|$|E
5|$|The {{load factor}} (or {{capacity}} factor) for South Australian wind farms is {{usually in the}} range 32-38%. This means that a wind farm could typically produce between 32 and 38% of its <b>nameplate</b> capacity averaged over a year.|$|E
5|$|Since {{wind speed}} is not constant, a wind farm's annual energy {{production}} is never {{as much as}} the sum of the generator <b>nameplate</b> ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 15–50%; values at {{the upper end of the}} range are achieved in favourable sites and are due to wind turbine design improvements.|$|E
5000|$|Due to a poor {{critical}} {{reception and}} lower than expected sales, the Five Hundred and Montego <b>nameplates</b> were discontinued for the 2008 model year. Although Ford Motor Company had unveiled pre-production 2008 models at auto shows using the Five Hundred/Montego <b>nameplates,</b> Ford CEO Alan Mullaly ordered the two <b>nameplates</b> retired; the Montego was rechristened the Sable for 2008 production.http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17003763/ http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17003763/ ...|$|R
50|$|Drivers' <b>nameplates</b> {{indicate}} the branch {{to which they}} belong, so some <b>nameplates</b> indicate branch offices that have been closed, moved or merged and {{are not included in}} the list above.|$|R
50|$|Initially allotted {{the number}} 637, it was fitted with curved <b>nameplates</b> {{over the middle}} driving wheels. Before entry into LNER service the number was altered to 4771, and the curved <b>nameplates</b> were {{replaced}} with straight <b>nameplates</b> mounted {{on the sides of}} the smokebox. In order to do this, the builder's plate (Doncaster Works No. 1837) had to be re-located to below the cab windows.|$|R
5|$|The body shell, {{suspension}} and electrics of the GM Zeta platform have been thoroughly reworked to reduce weight, improving handling and fuel efficiency. Changes {{to the model}} line-up see the deletion of the Berlina <b>nameplate</b> (which was merged with the standard Calais variant, represented the smallest share of sales in Commodore's line-up) and the base model renamed from Omega to Evoke.|$|E
5|$|Wind power {{capacity}} has expanded rapidly to 336 GW in June 2014, and {{wind energy production}} was around 4% of total worldwide electric power usage, and growing rapidly. The actual amount of electric power that wind is able to generate is calculated by multiplying the <b>nameplate</b> capacity by the capacity factor, which varies according to equipment and location. Estimates of the capacity factors for wind installations {{are in the range}} of 35% to 44%.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{power is}} variable, and during low wind periods {{it must be}} {{replaced}} by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power, is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, {{may be able to}} deliver their <b>nameplate</b> capacity around 95% of the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{base of the}} Conn Smythe Trophy {{has been}} {{expanded}} twice {{over the years to}} accommodate more winners. Although the 16 <b>nameplates</b> on the original base tier were filled up after , a new tier was not added until the 1983-84 season. Following the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals, the 20 <b>nameplates</b> on the new tier were filled up, so the first nine winners' <b>nameplates</b> were moved up to the remaining three sides of the foundation tier, with the remaining <b>nameplates</b> shifted accordingly to keep the winners in chronological order. Due to the cancellation of the 2004-05 season, the trophy wasn't filled up again until , after which a new tier was added, making room for 24 more names.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the name}} Tornado was chosen and <b>nameplates</b> {{manufactured}} {{long before the}} locomotive was completed, during commissioning and test running the <b>nameplates</b> were not attached. By railway convention, the locomotive is officially known by her number until the name plates are affixed.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 Con-Cor International, Ltd. {{produced}} {{a model of}} the Pioneer Zephyr. A limited number (350 HO scale and 250 N scale) of these bore the <b>nameplates</b> of the Silver Streak from the motion picture instead of the standard Burlington Route <b>nameplates.</b>|$|R
5|$|A Class 31 locomotive, number 31296, {{was named}} 'Amlwch Freighter'/'Trên Nwyddau Amlwch' in September 1986 at the Associated Octel plant. At this point, 33 {{years after the}} opening of the Octel plant at Amlwch, 2 million tonnes of traffic had been {{conveyed}} from their freight terminal. A scale model was produced by Lima with this <b>nameplate</b> affixed. The name was removed in March 1990 and transferred to the Class 47 locomotive 47330, which was renumbered 47390 for a period, retaining the name. This locomotive was later rebuilt as a Class 57, and renamed 'The Hood' by its new operator, Virgin Trains.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{introduced}} {{as a single}} sedan body style, the range expanded in 1979 to include a station wagon. From 1984, Holden began branding the flagship Commodore model as Holden Calais, with the Commodore Berlina introduced in 1984 gaining independent Holden Berlina nomenclature in 1988. Long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice derivatives and Commodore utility body variants followed in 1990. The third generation architecture spawned the most body styles, with a new Holden utility launched in 2000 (now officially as the Holden Ute), reborn Monaro coupé in 2001, four-door Holden Crewman utility and all-wheel drive (AWD) Holden Adventra crossover in 2003. Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) in 1987 began official modification of high performance variants of the Commodore and its derivatives, under its own <b>nameplate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once {{it became}} clear that the {{locomotives}} would be used further afield than the West Country, a decision was made to name the remainder after RAF squadrons, airfields, commanders and aircraft that had participated in the Battle of Britain over Kent, Surrey and Sussex. 'Battle of Britain' nameplates incorporated the name of the locomotive with the class name below, in a design that resembled the wings of an aircraft. This was painted Air Force blue, though other colours were sometimes substituted for the same reasons as above. An enamelled crest of the aircraft, personality or squadron was placed below the <b>nameplate,</b> in the same position as the West Country class equivalent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nameplates</b> {{are usually}} in upper case.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 it {{was sold}} to the Dartmouth Steam Railway. The {{locomotive}} was then painted in lined GWR Brunswick Green livery. On 1 August 2008 it was named Hercules, the <b>nameplates</b> being located on the smokebox. The <b>nameplates</b> are historically inauthentic for this locomotive.|$|R

5|$|The Kclass {{prototype}} operated {{without a}} name until 1925, when the Southern Railway's publicity department decided to name all express passenger locomotives. The locomotives constructed from 1925 were named after rivers {{found within the}} Southern Railway's operating area, and the class became known collectively as the River class. The first-completed Southern Railway Kclass No.A791 was named River Adur whilst the former SECR prototype was given the name River Avon; names were also allocated to the cancelled 1926 batch of locomotives. The K1class locomotive No.A890 was named River Frome. The names were displayed on a rectangular brass <b>nameplate</b> fitted to the water tank sides.|$|E
5|$|The Trustees of the Baltimore City College Scholarship Funds, Inc., was {{established}} and incorporated in 1983, and replaced a similar entity that {{was established}} in 1924. The Trustees manage endowments, most of which provide annual scholarships to graduating seniors based on criteria stipulated by the donors. Combined endowment assets are currently valued at or around $1.68 million (adjusted for inflation) covering thirty-four annual scholarships. To recognize the custodianship provided by the Trustees, the BCCAA has placed a bronze plaque in the main hall of the school which carries an individually cast <b>nameplate</b> {{for each of the}} thirty-four permanent endowments held by the Trustees.|$|E
5|$|With {{investment}} subsidies, {{the financial}} burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out {{as a function of}} the <b>nameplate</b> capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as Austin Energy in Texas, which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first two}} prototypes were {{numbered}} 7001 and 7002, {{and both were}} painted in different variations of a red and yellow livery. Misleadingly, 7001 wore [...] "Red Flag 6" [...] <b>nameplates</b> on the cab ends; 7002, however, carried new <b>nameplates</b> inscribed with the new designation, Red Flag 2.16 class, after the birthdate of Kim Jong-il.|$|R
5|$|As {{the figures}} {{given in the}} table above were {{published}} before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures. Wind speed is not constant, therefore, a wind farm's annual energy production never achieves {{the sum of the}} generator <b>nameplate</b> ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 20–40%, with values at {{the upper end of the}} range achieved on particularly favourable sites. The expected capacity factor for Scout Moor Wind Farm, calculated from the company's projected figures, is 27%. The actual capacity factor calculated from data published by OFGEM for June 2016 to May 2017 was 25.20%.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, the <b>nameplate</b> {{capacity}} of a photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), which refers to the solar array's DC power output. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in MWAC; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. A third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating photovoltaic power station has a {{capacity of}} over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical {{specifications}} carried over, {{except for}} a new five-speed manual transmission, optional on the 1.9-litre four-cylinder and 2.85-litre six-cylinder versions. In an attempt to improve sales figures of the inline-four engine, Holden spent considerable time improving its performance and efficiency. Modifications were also made to the 2.85-litre six to lift economy, and the powerplants managed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} by as much as 12.5 and 14percent, correspondingly. Holden released the sports-oriented Commodore SS sedan in September 1982—reintroducing a <b>nameplate</b> used briefly ten years prior with the HQ series. Provisioned with a choice of 4.2- or optional 5.0-litre V8 engines, both versions of the VH SS were teamed with a four-speed manual transmission. Racing driver Peter Brock's Holden Dealer Team (HDT) high performance outfit produced three upgraded versions, known as Group One, Group Two and Group Three, the latter version available in either 4.2-litre or more commonly 5.0-litre V8 configuration.|$|E
