5|$|In December, City manager Stuart Pearce {{publicly}} {{stated that}} Samaras {{would have to}} 'toughen up', {{if he wanted to}} be a success in the Premier League. He said that Samaras' all round game wasn't good enough, and that he would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to pass the ball better and compete more effectively. Some fans had criticised Pearce for signing Samaras, along with other foreign players, who had not settled in well enough to the English game. On 2 January, Samaras came on as a half-time substitute, and scored twice, as they beat Everton 2–1.|$|E

5|$|Yichang was keen for {{his eldest}} son to gain a basic {{education}} rooted in Confucianism, the dominant moral ideology of Chinese society; he deemed a knowledge of Confucian teaching to be essential in allowing his son to develop key business and administrative skills. His hope was that Zedong would gain an apprenticeship with a Xiangtan rice merchant before taking over the family business and supporting his parents during their old age. Yichang was particularly adamant on the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about Confucianism after losing a lawsuit over a parcel of land; he believed that his opponent had been victorious in the dispute {{as a result of}} their ability to quote the sayings of ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius throughout their argument.|$|E
5|$|Another {{defense that}} often uses color or shape to deceive {{potential}} enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear {{a striking resemblance}} to wasps, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex is referred to as Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine monarch. Later research has discovered that the viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian mimicry. In Müllerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known Müllerian complexes.|$|E
5|$|In humans, {{cells with}} location-specific firing {{patterns}} {{have been reported}} during a study of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize {{the source of their}} seizures, with a view to surgical resection. The patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampus and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London’s black cab drivers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the locations {{of a large number of}} places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|E

25|$|But a {{continuing}} emphasis to the well-rounded graduate {{can be seen}} in the University's approach to education degrees. As a solely graduate-level program, this is based on the principle that people <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> primary subject matter well before they can learn how to teach it to others. Thus future teachers at Lehigh often take a five-year program earning both a bachelor's degree in a specialized field and a master's degree in Education. This latter degree, along with the Business College's M.B.A., are among the most popular graduate programs in the University.|$|E

As a result, it is essential for healthcare professionals to practice cultural competence and recognize the differences as well as cultural sensitivities to provide holistic care for the patients.|$|E

40|$|Women’s fear of {{violence}} can impact negatively on their {{active participation in}} life. An ageing survey conducted with 2620 Australian respondents aged 50 to 90 years examined aspects of work, learning, social, spiritual and emotional status, health, vision, home, life events, demographics, and asked an open ended question about what being actively engaged in life meant. Ordinal regression was carried out on two dependent variables: wanting and <b>needing</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> discourage violence. Analyses found that as women’s age increased, those on lower incomes {{were more likely than}} others <b>to</b> say they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> discourage violence against them. This paper investigates the variables associated with the findings - transport, finances, news media, home safety, and reduced social interactions. Results highlight the importance of understanding women’s fear in the context of personal and social issues, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> provide <b>learning</b> opportunities <b>to</b> improve safety and social engagement...|$|R

25|$|Members of the Deaf {{community}} {{tend to view}} deafness as {{a difference}} in human experience rather than a disability or disease. Many members take pride in their Deaf identity. Deaf people, {{in the sense of}} a community or culture, can then be seen as a minority group, and therefore some who are a part of this community may feel misunderstood by those who don't know sign language. Another struggle that the Deaf community often faces is that educational institutions usually consist primarily of hearing people. Additionally, hearing family members may <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> sign language in order for the deaf person to feel included and supported. Unlike other cultures, a deaf person may join the community later in life, rather than being born into it.|$|E
25|$|Due to longstanding {{government}} {{restrictions on}} the teaching of Christianity (since the arrival of Jesuit missionaries in the 16th century) and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> Japanese, Rev. Liggins' and Williams' religious duties were initially limited to ministering to American and British residents of the Nagasaki foreign settlement, {{as well as to}} visiting sailors. However, they could also serve as interpreters, as well as teach English. Rev. Liggins compiled a Japanese-English phrasebook before ill-health forced his departure in February 1860. A medical missionary, Dr. Ernest Schmid, arrived, but ill-health also forced his departure; and a missionary teacher, Ms. Jeanette Conover, also returned to Shanghai due to Japanese anti-foreigner sentiment in 1863. The American Civil War also complicated matters; by 1864, Rev. Williams and a Dutch Reformed priest were the only Protestant missionaries remaining in Japan. Rev. Williams continued his limited duties and began translating the gospels. His first recorded baptism of a Japanese convert, a Kumamoto samurai named Shōmura Sukeuemon, was not until February 1866.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Transfer {{learning}} problems are typically framed as leveraging knowl-edge learned on a source task <b>to</b> improve <b>learning</b> on a related, but different, target task. Current transfer methods {{are able to}} suc-cessfully transfer knowledge between agents in different reinforcement learning tasks, reducing the time <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the target. However, the complimentary task of representation transfer, i. e. transferring knowledge between agents with different internal rep-resentations, has not been well explored. The goal in both types of transfer problems is the same: reduce the time <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> thetarget with transfer, relative <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> the target without transfer. This work introduces one such representation transfer algorithmwhich is implemented in a complex multiagent domain. Experiments demonstrate that transferring the learned knowledge betweendifferent representations is both possible and beneficial...|$|R
