40|$|Cell {{growth and}} {{proliferation}} are tightly {{controlled by the}} cyclic regulation of the cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks). Cdks are positively regulated through interactions with regulatory Cyclin partners {{as well as being}} negatively regulated through interactions with families of Cdk inhibitors (CKIs). The Spy 1 /RINGO family of proteins have emerged as a unique class of Cyclin-like proteins capable of directly binding both to the Cdks, as a positive regulatory partner, as well as to at least one member of the CKI 2 Ì† 7 s, p 27 Kip 1, as a negative regulator. Abnormally elevated levels of Spy 1 promote cell proliferation, <b>nhibit</b> apoptosis and are implicated in aggressive tumorgenesis in all cell/tissue types studied to date. Understanding how Spy 1 protein is regulated is essential in resolving how it contributes to normal and abnormal growth processes. Herein, we demonstrate that Spy 1 is degraded in a cell-cycle-dependent manner via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We have resolved the E 3 ligase and essential phosphorylation sites mediating Spy 1 A degradation. Furthermore, we show that Spy 1 protein is stabilized in subsets of human breast cancer samples. Using a stable mutant of Spy 1 we demonstrate that this represents an oncogenic modification in vitro and accelerates tumor formation in vivo. We further show that these oncogenic properties are largely dependent upon the unique activation of Cdk 1 and the subsequent inhibition of the anti-apoptotic regulator FOXO 1. Utilizing Spy 1 mutants unable to bind to the primary effectors p 27 and Cdk 2, we have found that Spy 1 -mediated effects in the breast rely on direct interactions with each of these effectors via separable functional mechanisms. This work reveals novel mechanisms regulating the progression, and potentially the etiology, of human breast cancers and may be of considerable therapeutic relevance...|$|E

Two isolates of alphaherpesvirus saimiri (c~HVS) (formerly herpesvirus tamarinus) have been shown to produce fatal encephalitis (KM 91) (Leib et al., 1988) or to establish latency (KM 322) in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) (Tosolini et al., 1982) when injected intradermally into rabbits. These isolates are very closely related in terms of restriction endonuclease dig st patterns, polypeptide immunoprecipitation and growth characteristics (Leib et al., 1987). Intradermal inoculation of rabbits in the flank with ~HVS KM 322 produces an initial skin lesion followed by ganglionitis as manifested by areas of hypoaesthesia (Tosolini et al., 1982).

40|$|Increased {{levels of}} G protein coupled {{receptor}} kinase GRK 2 appear {{to participate in}} hypertension presumably through the desensitization of beta adrenergic receptors (betaARs) that mediate vasodilatation. There are contrasting data on the occurrence of betaAR desensitization in the vasculature, we therefore investigated betaAR vasodilatation and desensitization in normotensives and in hypertensive humans. In blood lymphocytes, we assessed betaAR signaling and GRK 2 expression and found betaAR signaling alterations and, consistent with desensitization, ncreased GRK 2 levels in hypertensives. We studied in vivo vasodilatation to the betaAR agonist isoproterenol (ISO) injected in the brachia artery in control conditions and during the concomitant infusion of heparin, a known in vitro nonspecific GRK inhibitor. ISO induced a dose-dependent vasorelaxation that was attenuated in hypertensives indicating a loss of betaAR signaling. Intra-arterial infusion of heparin <b>nhibited</b> lymphocyte GRK 2 activity and prevented desensitization of betaAR vasodilatation in normotensives. In hypertensives, heparin restored vasodilatation to ISO, to levels observed in normotensives. Our results suggest that betaAR desensitization does indeed occur at the vascular levels in vivo, and that heparin by acting as a GRK inhibitor prevents this in normotensives and restores impaired betaAR vasodilation in hypertensives. We conclude that desensitization participates to impaired betaAR vasodilation in hypertension...|$|R

Combined inhibition of EGFR and other signaling proteins has become a successful therapeutic approach, stimulating the search for further determinants of resistance as basis for novel therapeutic strategies. Experimental Design:We established human cancer cell lines with various degrees of EGFR expression and sensitivityto EGFR inhibitors and analyzed signal transducers {{under the control of}} EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent pathways. Results:Multitargeted inhibitor vandetanib (ZD 6474) inhibited the growth and the phosphorylation of Akt and its effector p 70 S 6 kinase in both wild-type and EGFR inhibitor ^ resistant human colon, prostate, and breast cancer cells. We found that the resistant cell lines exhibit, as common feature, VEGFR- 1 /Flt- 1 overexpression, increased secretion of VEGF and placental growth factor, and augmented migration capabilities and that vandetanib is able to antagonize them. Accordingly, a new kinase assay revealed that in addition to VEGF receptor (VEGFR) - 2, RET, and EGFR, vandetanib efficientlyi <b>nhibits</b> also VEGFR- 1. The contribution of VEGFR- 1 to the resistant phenotype was further supported by the demonstration that VEGFR- 1 silencing in resistant cells restored sensitivityto anti-EGFR drugs and impaired migration capabilities, whereas exogenous VEGFR- 1 overexpression in wild-type cells conferred {{resistance to}} these agents. Conclusions:This studysh ows thatVEGFR- 1 contributes to anti-EGFR drug resistance in different human cancer cells. Moreover, vandetanib inhibitsVEGFR- 1 activation, cell proliferation, and migration, suggesting its potential utilityi n patients resistant to EGFR inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Interaction {{of plant}} growth {{regulators}} and {{reactive oxygen species}} to regulate petal senescence in wallflowers (Erysimum linifolium) Faezah Mohd Salleh 1, 2, Lorenzo Mariotti 4, Natasha D. Spadafora 1, Anna M. Price 1, 3, Piero Picciarelli 5, Carol Wagstaff 6, Lara Lombardi 4 and Hilary Rogers 1 * Abstract Background: In many species floral senescence is coordinated by ethylene. Endogenous levels rise, and exogenous application accelerates senescence. Furthermore, floral senescence {{is often associated with}} increased reactive oxygen species, and is delayed by exogenously applied cytokinin. However, how these processes are linked remains largely unresolved. Erysimum linifolium (wallflower) provides an excellent model for understanding these interactions due to its easily staged flowers and close taxonomic relationship to Arabidopsis. This has facilitated microarray analysis of gene expression during petal senescence and provided gene markers for following the effects of treatments on different regulatory pathways. Results: In detached Erysimum linifolium (wallflower) flowers ethylene production peaks in open flowers. Furthermore senescence is delayed by treatments with the ethylene signalling inhibitor silver thiosulphate, and accelerated with ethylene released by 2 -chloroethylphosphonic acid. Both treatments with exogenous cytokinin, or 6 -methyl purine (which is an inhibitor of cytokinin oxidase), delay petal senescence. However, treatment with cytok inin also increases ethylene biosynthesis. Despite the similar effects on senescence, tran script abundance of gene markers is affected differentially by the treatments. A significant rise in transcript abundance of WLS 73 (a putative aminocyclopropa necarboxylate oxidase) was abolished by cytokinin or 6 -meth yl purine treatments. In contrast, WFSAG 12 transcript (a senescence marker) continued to accumulate significantly, albeit at a reduced rate. Silver thiosulphate suppre ssed the increase in transcript abundance both of WFSAG 12 and WLS 73. Activity of reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes changed during senescence. Treatments that increased cytokinin levels, or i <b>nhibited</b> ethylene action, reduced accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, although auxin levels rose with sene scence, treatments that delayed early senescence did not affect transcript abundance of WPS 46, an auxin-induced gene. Conclusions: A model for the interaction between cytokinins, ethylene, reactive oxygen species and auxin in the regulation of floral senescence in wallflowers is proposed. The combined increase in ethylene and reduction in cytokinin triggers the initiation of senescence and these two plant growth regulators directly or indirectly result in increased reactive oxygen species levels. A fall in conjugated auxin and/or the total auxin pool eventually triggers abscission...|$|R
40|$|Bacteriophages are viruses infecting bacteria. Although their genome enc odes all the {{proteins}} of the phage particle, bacteriophages are complete ly {{dependent on the}} host cell for their reproduction. Their infection pr ocess involves a number of tightly programmed steps: adsorption to the h ost cell, internalization of the genome (the stage after which temperate phages can become quiescent), transition of a host to a phage-directed metabolism, replication of the phage genome, morphogenesis and finally p ackaging and host lysis. Interactions between phage proteins and bacterial proteins play an impor tant role during infection of the host cell. A survey of all known bacte riophage-host interactions reveals that the targeted host proteins are i <b>nhibited,</b> activated or redirected to a different function by the phage p roteins. Through these interactions, a bacteriophage adapts the host cel l metabolism to establish an efficient infection cycle and directs some components of the host cell machinery towards production of new virions. In addition, some bacteriophage-host interactions protect the bacteriop hage from bacterial defense mechanisms, rather than steering the host ce ll metabolism. Our survey reveals {{that the majority of}} bacteriophage-hos t interactions involve phage early proteins, which are produced immediat ely after infection of the host cell. However, to date the large majorit y of this group of proteins remains unstudied. The lack of functional in dications and sequence similarity with other proteins seriously hampers their characterization. The only functional clue is that many of these p roteins are likely to be involved in bacteriophage-host interactions. Therefore, a systematic identification of bacteriophage-host interaction s could provide hints towards the function of the phage early proteins a nd create a starting point for their functional characterization. To add ress this issue, we selected the early proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginos a-infecting bacteriophage phiKMV for interaction analysis using ye ast two-hybrid. The phage early proteins referred to as gene product 1 t o 10 (gp 1 to p 10) were used as bait to identify their interaction partne r(s) from a library of P. aeruginosa PAO 1 proteins. To optimize the yeast two-hybrid system, the interactions among phiKMV p roteins gp 1 to 16 were investigated first. At the same time this provide s an insight into the functional relationships among these proteins. Thr ee homotypic interactions (gp 7 with gp 7, gp 9 with gp 9 and gp 15 with gp 15) were identified by these experiments. Using these small-scale experime nts the yeast two-hybrid procedure was optimized. The combination of a t wo-step selection procedure with a suitable media composition and approp riate 3 AT concentration reduces the background activity without losing m uch specificity. Although not essential for the small-scale experiments, it enables efficient interaction selection in the library-scale experim ents. A yeast two-hybrid prey library of random genomic fragments of P. aerugi nosa PAO 1 was constructed for the identification of bacteriophage-hos t interactions. This 24 -fold redundant library consists of 9. 94 x 106 in dependent clones, 7. 23 x 106 (72. 8 %) of which carry a plasmid with rando mly distributed PAO 1 inserts (on average 571 bp). This broadly applic able and highly redundant library allows delineation of potential intera ction domains. Afterwards, bacteriophage early proteins gp 1 to gp 10 were screened again st the highly redundant prey library. In total, five bacteriophage-host interactions proved to be reproducible and specific. The confirmatory ye ast two-hybrid experiments following the initial identification of inter actions proved very important for the assessment of the true positive ch aracter of these interactions. Four out of five interactions were verifi ed by in vitro interaction analysis. phiKMV early proteins gp 3, gp 4, gp 9 and gp 10 interact with proteins PA 1665, PA 4466, PA 0482 and PA 4360 of P. aeruginosa PAO 1, respectively. In addition to these four interact ions, one bacteriophage-host interaction (gp 3 with PA 4760) was identifie d in a analogous phage display study (K. Hertveldt, unpublished results). The specificity of this interaction was also verified by in vitro i nteraction analysis. Four out of five interactions do not resemble any o f the known bacteriophage-host interactions at all, suggesting the targe ting of metabolic enzymes, secretion systems and global regulators of so me branches of the cellular metabolism. The interaction between gp 3 and cochaperone DnaJ is reminiscent of the interaction between T 4 gp 31 and c haperone GroEL. Since several bacteriophage early proteins of other phages inhibit criti cal cellular processes, expression of the corresponding genes is lethal or very deleterious to the host cells. Identification of toxic bacteriop hage products and their interaction partner (if they have one) has been used by others for the identification of new antibacterial targets in St aphylococcus aureus and the development of antibacterial compounds di rected against these targets. To investigate this claim of widespread to xicity among bacteriophage early proteins and assess the antibacterial p otential of the phiKMV early proteins, the corresponding open reading fr ames (ORFs) were expressed in P. aeruginosa PAO 1. Gp 5 inhibits growth of P. aeruginosa PAO 1 completely, whereas gp 4 is only toxic on solid medium. However, the growth inhibitory effect of gp 4 was unrelated to i ts interaction with PA 4466 and we were unable to identify a bacteriophag e-host interaction for gp 5. Because of this, these bacteriophage-host in teractions are not applicable for development of new antibacterial compo nents at this point. Since the other eight phiKMV early proteins do not influence host cell growth, possibly {{only a small fraction of}} the early proteins in general exerts a growth-inhibitory effect. To assess the influence of the bacteriophage-host interactions on the in fection cycle of phiKMV, the targeted host genes were deleted, in order to disrupt the bacteriophage-host interaction. None of the targeted host proteins are essential for phiKMV infection. Infection of P. aeruginosa PAO 1 deltaPA 4466 and especially of PAO 1 deltaPA 0482 resu lted in reduced infection efficiency. Infection of the other deletion mu tants did not result in an altered in infection efficiency, suggesting t hat these interactions are not needed under the conditions investigated or that the targeted proteins are inhibited. The bacteriophage-host interaction of gp 9 with PA 0482, which has the str ongest influence on the infection cycle, was chosen for detailed analysi s. Apart from the bacteriophage-host interaction, characterization of th e malate synthase G of P. aeruginosa can be of interest to the develo pment of antibacterial molecules. The malate synthase was characterized biochemically. The most remarkable observation was the relatively high p H optimum (8. 5) and the stability of the protein at elevated pHs (pH 8 t o 11). The malate synthase is essential for the growth on acetate, which is in agreement with the prediction of a single malate synthase in the P. aeruginosa. Since the minimal interaction domain of gp 9 on malate synthase G includes a part of the substrate binding pockets and the acti ve site, an effect of gp 9 on the enzymatic activity was investigated. So me experiments suggest a very modest increase in activity upon addition of a large excess of gp 9. But from a biological point of view, such a sm all effect seems unlikely to be the main effect of gp 9 on PA 0482. Thus f ar, a direct and significant effect of gp 9 on the enzymatic activity is absent, which is in agreement with the absence of a visible effect of gp 9 on the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO 1 on several growth media. This work shows that the bacteriophage-host interactome provides hints t owards the elucidation of the function of the early phage proteins. The future challenge is to develop a systematic tool that provides clear-cut answers towards the effect of these bacteriophage-host interactions.
