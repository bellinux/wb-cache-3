5|$|The {{degenerate}} matter {{that makes up}} the bulk of a white dwarf has a very low opacity, because any absorption of a photon requires that an electron must transition to a higher empty state, which may not be possible as the energy of the photon may not be a match for the possible quantum states available to that electron, hence radiative heat transfer within a white dwarf is low; it does, however, have a high thermal conductivity. As a result, the interior of the white dwarf maintains a uniform temperature, approximately 107K. An outer shell of <b>non-degenerate</b> matter cools from approximately 107K to 104K. This matter radiates roughly as a black body. A white dwarf remains visible for a long time, as its tenuous outer atmosphere of normal matter begins to radiate at about 107K, upon formation, while its greater interior mass is at 107 K but cannot radiate through its normal matter shell.|$|E

25|$|Magnetic {{splitting}} (hyperfine splitting) is {{a result}} of the interaction between the nucleus and any surrounding magnetic field.

For example, a nucleus with spin state Inbsp&=nbsp&3/2 will split into 4 <b>non-degenerate</b> sub-states with m'I values of +3/2, +1/2, −1/2 and −3/2. Each split is hyperfine, being in the order of 10−7nbsp&eV. The selection rule of magnetic dipoles means that transitions between the excited state and ground state can only occur where m'I changes by 0 or 1. This gives 6 possible transitions for a 3/2 to 1/2 transition. In the majority of cases only 6 peaks can be monitored in a spectrum produced by a hyperfine splitting.|$|E

On the other hand, every manifold carrying a dual pair of Codazzi structures can be represented as a <b>non-degenerated</b> Lagrangian submanifold of a para-Kähler manifold. We derive this equivalence from a similar, but more general one, relating <b>non-degenerated</b> half-dimensional immersions in para-Kähler manifolds to dual pairs of what we call pre-Codazzi structures. We specialize this equivalence in two cases. Firstly, we show that every projectively flat manifold carries a natural pre-Codazzi structure, and can be, at least locally, represented as a half-dimensional immersion in a special para-Kähler manifold, which we call the cross-ratio manifold. Secondly, we show that manifolds carrying pre-Codazzi structures with flat connections are represented by half-dimensional immersions in the flat para-Kähler space. Our results have applications in affine differential geometry. Namely, centro-affine geometry {{can be seen as the}} geometry of Lagrangian immersions in the crossratio manifold, while the geometry of graph immersions is equivalent to the geometry of Lagrangian immersions in the flat para-Kähler space.
