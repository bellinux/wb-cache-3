40|$|The {{distribution}} of cells containing cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (C-Ig cells) over various lymphoid organs was studied in congenitally athymic (<b>nude)</b> <b>mice</b> {{as a function}} of age. The C-IgM, C-IgG and C-IgA cells were enumerated in spleen, bone marrow, mesenteric lymph node and Peyer's patches of <b>nude</b> <b>mice</b> and their heterozygous littermates of 6, 40 and 100 weeks of age. In the nude {{as well as in the}} heterozygous mice an age-related shift was observed in the localization of the C-Ig cells. In young mice of both groups the majority of these cells resided in the spleen, whereas in adult and old mice the bone marrow was found to be the major C-Ig cell organ, indicating that this shift is not dependent on the presence of the thymus. In young and adult <b>nude</b> and heterozygous <b>mice</b> C-Ig cell numbers in the spleen were comparable, whereas C-Ig cell numbers in the other lymphoid organs were higher in the heterozygous mice than in the <b>nude</b> <b>mice.</b> The total C-Ig cell number in young and adult <b>nude</b> <b>mice</b> was lower than in heterozygous mice of the same age, whereas in old <b>nude</b> <b>mice</b> they were as high as in heterozygous mice of the same age, indicating a retarded development of the immunological activity in <b>nude</b> <b>mice.</b> C-Ig cells in <b>nude</b> <b>mice</b> were almost exclusively of the IgM class, although in the bone marrow of the oldest animals also a substantial number of C-IgG and C-IgA cells was observed. Our finding that <b>nude</b> <b>mice</b> can live up to at least two years of age indicates that the age-related deterioration of the thymus-dependent limb of the immune system is not the cause of ageing, but rather a consequence of it...|$|R
