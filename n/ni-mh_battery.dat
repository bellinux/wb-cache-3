40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare different methods of assessing environmental impacts in order to highlight their complementarities. Bouman et al.

Following this idea, the {{objective of}} this study is to perform and compare SFA, LCA and an economic analysis on the more realistic cases of lead-acid batteries (PbA) and nickel-metal hydride <b>batteries</b> (<b>Ni-MH)</b> for electric vehicles. The SFA allowed us to identify low lead emissions into the environment at production and recycling stages of PbA batteries, whereas relatively large nickel emissions at the manufacturing step of <b>Ni-MH</b> <b>batteries</b> are observed. According to LCA, <b>Ni-MH</b> primary <b>batteries</b> (without recycled materials) have more impacts on the environment than primary PbA batteries, but this result is reversed when the batteries are made from recycled lead or nickel. The economic analysis showed that <b>Ni-MH</b> <b>batteries</b> are much more expensive than PbA batteries but if the decrease in price due to the scale effect is considered, the difference will decrease when the market will grow up. A multiobjective optimization finally proved that the best solution is to keep both battery technologies: it is therefore interesting to use not merely one method, but to compare several strategies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to estimate accurately the battery residual capacity (BRC) of the nickel-metal hydride (<b>Ni-MH)</b> <b>battery</b> for modern electric vehicles (EVs).

The inputs are the temperature and the discharged capacity distribution describing the discharge current profile, while the output is the state of available capacity (SOAC) representing the BRC. The estimated SOAC from ANFIS model and the measured SOAC from experiments are compared, and the results confirm that the proposed approach can provide an accurate estimation of the SOAC under variable discharge currents. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Abstract — A {{numerical}} {{study is}} {{presented in this paper}} to examine the dynamic behavior for the detailed characterization of commercially available <b>Ni-MH</b> <b>battery.</b> In the present study, a novel Multi-Regression Analysis (MRA) based model for the D-size HHR 650 D battery from panasonic is adopted to ascertain the charge and discharge characteristics along with its SoC estimation. Oxygen gas formation at the Ni electrode during charging and overcharging that affects the pressure variations inside the battery is essential to be analyzed for its characterization. Henceforth, the effect of battery charging conditions over the pressure and temperature variations are considered in the developed MRA model and the corresponding performance profiles subjected to recurrent load cycles are reported. Model validation of the steady state behavior is performed based on the benchmark data obtained from a 6. 5 Ah, 1. 2 V Nickel-Metal Hydride battery. The result obtained shows that the regression model responses fit well with the benchmark result. Moreover, the model can also predict pressure and temperature dynamics under a sudden change in charging and discharging states.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{have the largest}} hydrogen storage capacity among the hydrogen storage materials known at present. The <b>Ni-MH</b> <b>battery</b> {{can be used to}} store and then discharge large amounts of hydrogen reversibly by using hydrogen storage materials as negative electrode. The electrochemical hydrogen storage performances of metal hydride electrodes with different levels of multi wall carbon nanotubes (20 %, 15 %, 10 %, 5 % and 2 % of Ni-MH battery's active materials) has been investigated under similar charge-discharge conditions. Electrochemical test cell consisted of a single hydrogen storage negative electrode sandwiched between two NiOOH/Ni(OH) 2 positive electrodes. A 6 M aqueous KOH solution was used as electrolyte. Electrochemical properties such as specific discharge capacity, high rate charge-discharge capability and cycle life stability have been investigated. The morphology and structure of negative electrode material were examined by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. Chemical analysis of the hydrogen storage alloy was performed using electron probe microanalysis, electron diffraction spectroscopy and induced coupled plasma spectroscopy analysis. Hydrogen absorption-desorption properties were measured in terms of pressure-composition-isotherm curves.
