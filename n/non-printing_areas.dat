40|$|The {{contents}} of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) were monitored in materials used for packaging films of meat products. A printed sample and a non-printed sample {{were taken from}} each of the packaging films analysed, the sample area being 1 dm 2, {{to determine whether or not}} there is increased presence of phthalates in printed packaging films compared to non-printed packaging films, and to assess possible risks arising from their use. The determination of DBP and DEHP was conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the Zorbax Eclipse C 8 column and UV detection at a wavelength of 224 nm. Concentrations of phthalates ranged from 2. 18 to 81. 33 µg∙dm- 2 in printed samples and from 2. 25 to 69. 88 µg∙dm- 2 in those without printing. This study shows different {{contents of}} phthalates in printed and <b>non-printed</b> <b>areas</b> of packaging films. The printed area had in most cases a higher content of phthalates probably due to the content of the substances in the printing colours.

As the cylinder rotates, it draws excess ink onto its surface and into the cells. Acting as a squeegee, the doctor blade scrapes the cylinder before it makes contact with the paper, removing the excess ink from the <b>non-printing</b> (non-recessed) <b>areas</b> and leaving in the cells {{the right amount of}} ink required.

2500|$|Offset {{printing}} is {{a widely}} used printing technique where the inked image is transferred (or [...] "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface.

50|$|Offset ink is a {{specific}} type of ink used in conjunction with offset printing presses such as those used to produce letterpress or lithography prints. Such ink must be specially formulated to resist other chemicals it will come in contact with on the printing press. It is crucial that offset ink resist water-in-ink emulsification (e.g. repel rather than absorb water). It should also withstand degradation by the fountain solution which covers the <b>non-printing</b> <b>areas</b> of the engraved plate.|$|E

50|$|Woodcut is {{a relief}} {{printing}} technique in printmaking. An artist carves an image into {{the surface of}} a block of wood—typically with gouges—leaving the printing parts level with the surface while removing the non-printing parts. Areas that the artist cuts away carry no ink, while characters or images at surface level carry the ink to produce the print. The block is cut along the wood grain (unlike wood engraving, where the block is cut in the end-grain). The surface is covered with ink by rolling over the surface with an ink-covered roller (brayer), leaving ink upon the flat surface but not in the <b>non-printing</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A second {{method of}} {{creating}} imagery on the vitreograph plate is waterless lithography (sometimes called “siligraphy”). The process was originally developed by 3M Company for commercial printing {{in the late}} 1960s; it was purchased and subsequently refined by Toray Industries of Japan. The commercial process {{is a type of}} offset printing that uses photo-sensitized silicone rubber plates. The waterless lithography process employed in fine art printmaking has been credited to Nik Semenoff, who developed it for use on metal plates.Donald Furst demonstrated his adaptation of the silicone method to glass plate printmaking in June, 1995, and the Littleton Studios adopted his process for their work with glass plate lithography. The image is drawn onto a ground glass matrix with water-soluble art materials, over which is applied a film of common caulking silicone thinned with synthetic turpentine. Master printer Mark Mahaffey has found that frosted Mylar {{can be used as a}} printing matrix as well as 3/8” float glass to create a vitreograph using waterless lithography. [...] After the silicone layer cures, the original drawing is gently washed from the plate with water, dried, and inked with a roller. The silicone layer protects the <b>non-printing</b> <b>areas</b> of the image while allowing open areas (those free of silicone) to accept ink. Like intaglio vitreographs, waterless lithographs on glass plates are transferred to paper in an etching press.|$|E
40|$|A {{printing}} and non-printing surface {{structure of the}} offset printing forms are key factors in maintaining the conventionaloffset printing. The main characteristics of the surface are: physical and chemical structure, surface tensionand surface roughness. Surface topography {{is one of the}} critical factors which could cause the instability inthe quality performance and the durability of the printing forms. During the printing process these characteristicschange and directly influence the print. Performed investigations are {{based on the fact that}} the changes in physicalchemicalproperties of the <b>non-printing</b> <b>areas</b> as well as the changes in the surface micro structure of the printingforms directly influence the quality of the reproduction. In this paper, the behaviour of non-printing elements of athermal CTP plate developed in a fresh developer and used for a print run of 123. 000, 177. 000 and 300. 000 copieson a web offset heat-set printing press has been investigated. Investigation made in a paper showed that high depthof focus SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) can provide detailed topographical information about the surface,but cannot provide quantitative topographical information. Due to this fact, the printing forms have been also observedand analysed before and after the print run by a mechanical stylus profilometer. The investigations revealthe appearance of the physical changes as well as the geometrical ones. As a result of these changes, the influenceof a fountain solution on the printing form may also vary, as well as the balance between the ink and the fountainsolution during the printing process...|$|E
40|$|To find an {{approach}} for reusable offset printing plates hydrophobic and hydrophilic modified Titanium Dioxide surfaces (TiO 2 surfaces) were studied {{with regard to}} macroscopic wetting properties and molecules relevant for wettability. The macroscopic wetting behaviour was studied by Contact Angle measurements and calculation of surface free energy Sigma. Surface end groups responsible for the wettability could be detected for hydrophilic and hydrophobic TiO 2 surfaces by Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Surface topography and the arrangement of molecules on different modified TiO 2 surfaces were measured with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). In addition measurements with the Friction Force Mode (FFM) of the AFM led to nanoscopic values of the adhesion force for hydrophobic and hydrophilic TiO 2 surfaces. Therefore hydrophobic AFM tips were used and measurements were carried out in water. The changes in adhesion forces on TiO 2 surfaces which were two-dimensionally micro-structured in hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas could be imaged as well by FFM. On such structured surfaces the distribution of elements {{was determined by the}} two-dimensional mapping of X-Ray Photoelectrons (XP-Mapping). To carry ink in the offset printing process hydrophobic TiO 2 surfaces were prepared by covering initially hydrophilic TiO 2 surfaces with adsorbates (hydro-carbons) by storage in air or by dipping in 1 mM ethanolic solutions of octadecyl phosphonic acid (OPA) or semiperfluorinated octadecyl phosphonic acid (SF-OPA). The contact angles for such surfaces were in the range of 50 - 80 ° for TiO 2 surfaces stored in air and in the range of 80 - 150 ° for TiO 2 surfaces covered with OPA or SF-OPA. Hydrophilic TiO 2 surfaces could be generated by wet chemistry (NH 4 OH:H 2 O 2 :H 2 O) as well as by selective irradiation with IR- or UV-Laser. Hydrophilic areas of an offset printing master represent the <b>non-printing</b> <b>areas</b> in the printing process...|$|E
