The article begins with the idea that making produces a 'surrogate' of the body, which extends the body into the world, reforming the body and the world and their relationship. The ideas the article offers run counter to certain currents of thought that reduce making to a <b>narrow</b> <b>cast</b> anthropocentric crafting.

In other words, the body is extended into the world through what is made and this made world acts ineluctably on, and in, making.

40|$|Abstract U. S. {{public opinion}} {{regarding}} climate change {{has become increasingly}} polarized in recent years, as partisan think tanks and others worked to recast an originally scientific topic into a political wedge issue. Nominally 2 ̆ 2 scientific 2 ̆ 2 arguments against taking anthropogenic climate change seriously have been publicized to reach informed but ideologically receptive audiences. Reflecting the success of such arguments, polls have noted that concern about climate change increased with education among Democrats, but decreased with education among Republicans. These observations lead to the hypothesis that there exist interaction (non-additive) effects between education or knowledge and political orientation, net of other background factors, in predicting public concern about climate change. Two regional telephone surveys, conducted in New Hampshire (n = 541) and Michigan (n = 1, 008) in 2008, included identical climate-change questions that provide opportunities to test this hypothesis. Multivariate analysis of both surveys finds significant interactions. These empirical results fit with theoretical interpretations and several other recent studies. They suggest that the classically identified social bases of concern about the environment in general, and climate in particular, have shifted in recent years. <b>Narrow</b> <b>cast</b> media, including the many Web sites devoted to discrediting climate-change concerns, provide ideal conduits for channeling contrarian arguments to an audience predisposed to believe and electronically spread them further.

Using headed bars minimises the lap length required with in the cast - in - situ joint region.

Th e paper describes a series of tensile tests which were carried out to simulate the tensile zone of a joint loaded in pure flexure. The headed bars used in the tests were 25 mm in diameter with 70 mm square heads and yield strength of 5 30 MPa. The tests studied the influences of concrete strength, headed bar spacing, splice length, transverse reinforcement and conf ining shear studs on joint strength. A lap length of 100 mm in concrete with 28 MPa cylinder strength was found to be sufficient to develop the full strength of the headed bars. A strut - and - tie model (STM) is presented for determining joint strength. Analys is shows that the STM gives safe results even though it does not fully capture the observed joint behaviour. An upper bound plasticity model is found to give relatively good predictions of joint strength in most cases, although it also does not always capt ure the correct failure mechanism. The tests provide insights into joint behaviour which, in conjunction with numerical modelling, will facilitate the development of an improved design method.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the design and}} behaviour of <b>narrow</b> <b>cast</b> in-situ joints between precast concrete elements in which continuity of reinforcement is achieved through overlapping headed bars. The use of headed bars minimises the required reinforcement lap length and hence joint width, thereby, maximising the area of precast concrete units. Confining reinforcement {{in the form of}} transverse bars and vertical shear studs is installed within the joint. Improved understanding of the behaviour of such joints is obtained by means of experimental testing and numerical analysis. In total, 32 tensile specimens and five flexural specimens were tested. The main longitudinal reinforcement in all specimens consisted of 25 mm diameter headed bars with 70 mm square heads. The tests investigated the influence on joint performance of concrete strength, confining shear studs, transverse bar arrangement, headed bar lap length and spacing, and out-of-plane offset of precast planks. For tensile specimens, a lap length of 100 mm with four 16 mm transverse bars and concrete compressive strength of 28 MPa was sufficient for headed bar yield. Ductile flexural failure, with headed bar yield, was achieved with the same lap length, two 20 mm transverse bars and concrete compressive strength of 39 MPa. A nonlinear finite element model (NLFEM) is presented with results showing that it captures the behaviour of the joint well. Additional parametric studies carried out with the validated NLFEM provide otherwise unavailable insights into joint behaviour. In conjunction with an appropriate safety format, the model is considered suitable for the design of standard joint configurations. Analytical models based on the strut-and-tie method and upper bound plasticity are presented. The models were found to give reasonable predictions of joint strength, but are not capable of fully capturing the observed joint behaviour. An improved strut and tie design method is suggested and recommendations are made for optimising joint design. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{rebranding}} of Headlines Today, the English {{news channel}} from TV Today Network Ltd, to India Today, its 40 -year-old flagship English news magazine {{was to keep}} pace and move to a world of seamless news on digital devices by adopting non-linear philosophy. The re- launch has given a new dimension of storytelling from shifting linear to being non linear as on the web. India Today can {{claim to be a}} new channel with fresh content. This rebranding has improved the credibility by aligning its idea of an integrated newsroom. This paper is focused to probe into (a) the viability of rebranding of Headlines Today in India Today (b) the role of established print brand of India Today in boosting the brand equity of digital India Today through rebranding (c) the viability of adopting non-linear news telling strategy to draw viewers. Design / Methodology/ Approach: The study being exploratory in nature relies on secondary data collected from print and digital resources. One of the major tools that is applied in study of impact of television channel is Television Rating Point (TRP). The word TRP has now been reworded as TVT (Television Viewership in Thousands) and GRP (Gross Rating Point) is now GVT (Gross Viewership in Thousands). TRP is a tool provided to judge which programmes are viewed the most. This gives an index of the choice of the people and also the popularity of a particular channel. Findings: TV journalism is linear. It has gone beyond that and brought India Today ethos of journalism on to television. India Today is a very big brand, and it exists across mediums. For people who are consuming news, dividing brand or mediums does not work. It is prudent to give brand that he trusts across platforms. With the new look, the channel has also <b>narrow</b> <b>casted</b> various segments of age groups. The group banded everything in Hindi under the name of Aaj Tak and everything in English under India Today. And that strategy has worked really well. Limitations: Sources suggest that a huge number of channels in India use two spots on the cable network (dual frequency) and India Today TV were using dual frequency on multiple networks. However, this increased the chances of sampling and necessitates for re-sampling and retesting empirically on the basis of primary data. Practical implications: Rebranding is not all about changing the logo but there is a broader idea upon which rebranding is pivoted on. It is an expensive process. If rebranding is done just for a tinkering of the logo, without actually reflecting what the audience wants to see, it will not work in the long run. Digitization has given viewers more choice to select what they want to pay for and watch. And with more progress on the digitization front, the future will see more and more TV channels rebranding. Originality/Value: The paper assesses viewership of the English news genre which is so fragile that even minor changes look significant. Based on inputs from Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) and TAM Media Research Pvt. Ltd the trend has been tracked. It was also revealed that the effort of rebranding was paying off...|$|R

40|$|CMOS {{image sensor}} {{designers}} {{take advantage of}} technology scaling either by reducing pixel size or by adding more transistors to the pixel. In both cases, {{the distance from the}} chip surface to the photodiode increases relative to the photodiode planar dimensions. As a result, light must travel through an increasingly deeper and narrower "tunnel " before it reaches the photodiode. This is especially problematic for light incident at oblique angles; the <b>narrow</b> tunnel walls <b>cast</b> a shadow on the photodiode, which in turn severely reduces its effective QE. We refer to this phenomenon as pixel vignetting. The paper presents experimental results from a 640 x 512 CMOS image sensor fabricated using a O. 35 j 4 -layer metal CMOS process that shows significant QE reduction of up to 50 % for off-axis relative to on-axis pixels. Using simple geometric models of the sensor and the imaging optics, we compare the QE for on and off-axis pixels. We find that our analysis results support the hypothesis that the experimentally observed QE reduction is indeed due to pixel vignetting. We show that pixel vignetting becomes more severe as CMOS technology scales, even for a 2 -layer metal APS pixel. Finally, we briefly discuss several potential solutions to the pixel vignetting problem...|$|R

40|$|A {{steerable}} low-noise {{source of}} illumination is described for shadow-sensors having a displacement sensitivity of ∼ 100 pm (rms) /√Hz, at 500 Hz, over a measuring span {{of at least}} ± 0. 5 mm. These sensors were designed to detect lateral "Violin-Mode" resonances in the highly tensioned fused-silica suspension fibres of the test-masses/mirrors for the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory gravitational wave detectors. The shadow sensors—one intended {{for each of the}} four fibres in a suspension—comprised a source of Near InfraRed (NIR) radiation (emitter) and a differential shadow-displacement sensor (detector), these bracketing the fibre under test. The suspension fibres themselves were approximately 600 mm long by 0. 4 mm in diameter, and when illuminated from the side, they <b>cast</b> <b>narrow,</b> vertical, shadows onto their respective detectors—these being located at an effective distance of 50 fibre diameters behind the axes of the fibres themselves. The emitter described here was designed to compensate for a significant degree of mechanical drift or creep over time in the mean position of its suspension fibre. This was achieved by employing five adjacent columns of 8 × miniature NIR LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes, λ = 890 nm), with one column being activated at a time. When used in conjunction with a "reverse Galilean" telescope, the LED sources allowed the collimated beam from the emitter to be steered azimuthally in fine angular increments (0. 65 ◦), causing the fibre's shadow to move laterally, in a step-wise manner, across the plane of its facing detector. Each step in shadow position was approximately 0. 23 mm in size, and this allowed the fibre's shadow to be re-centred, so as to bridge once again both elements of its photodiode detector—even if the fibre was off-centred by as much as ± 0. 5 mm. Re-centring allowed Violin-Mode vibrations of the fibre to be sensed once again as differential AC photocurrents, these flowing in anti-phase in the two elements of the "split-photodiode" detector.
