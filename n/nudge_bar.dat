2500|$|The FJ-S Cruiser Concept, debuted at the 2012 SEMA Auto Show in Las Vegas, NV, is the {{creation}} of Toyota and Toyota Racing Development (TRD) in an effort to create a new style of FJ Cruiser that from its looks, remains fairly similar, but is designed to be even more off-road ready than its standard FJ Cruiser counterparts. The FJ-S Cruiser Concept actually incorporates suspension components from the Baja Series Tacoma and has an upgraded chassis and body structure with the addition of an underbody [...] "exoskeleton" [...] to improve its off-road prowess. According to Toyota, the extra stiffness and strength provided by the exoskeleton creates a more suitable platform for the suspension modifications and wheel upgrades added, which include 60-mm Bilstein racing shocks up front and 50-mm Bilstein racing shocks with remote reservoirs in the rear which produce around 1.3" [...] of lift over stock. Also, the FJ-S features all new TRD 17-inch wheels in a Midnight Black finish along with BFGoodrich Mud-Terrain tires. TRD also added their new supercharger with a Twin Vortex System and a large air-to-water intercooler, which brings the engine output to 345 horsepower and 345 lb/ft of torque, which is 30% and 25% of increase over the standard FJ Cruiser model. The exterior of the FJ-S Cruiser Concept received other changes/upgrades including a front <b>nudge</b> <b>bar</b> and the rock rails used on other FJ Cruiser variants. The color Toyota chose for this model is the Quicksand color, but unlike other FJ variants, they kept the white roof as opposed to doing a monochromatic color scheme. The interior of the FJ-S debuted an all-new two-tone leather seating with the FJ-S logos on the seatbacks along with custom floor mats.|$|E
50|$|A push bumper or <b>nudge</b> <b>bar</b> is {{fitted to}} the chassis {{of the car}} and located to augment the front bumper, to allow the car {{to be used as a}} {{battering}} ram for simple structures or fences, or to push disabled vehicles off the road.|$|E
5000|$|A Thunder Edition is {{available}} on 4x4 LX, LT and LTZ models. Among the features included with the pack are a <b>nudge</b> <b>bar</b> and towing kit, front carpet floor mats and a one-piece rear carpet floor mat, a bonnet protector, slimline weather shields and [...] "Thunder" [...] badging.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{restyling}} of 1970 began {{drifting away}} from the original design as quad headlights were introduced on Deluxe and Futura models, new front and rear bumpers with vertical <b>nudge</b> <b>bars</b> and disc brakes with 14-inch wheels and low-aspect red-striped radial tyres are now available as options. The 188 and 221 cid engines were now standard. The Futura Rural station wagon was discontinued, instead replaced by the similarly equipped Falcon Rural Deluxe.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} {{two different types of}} nudging - among them presumed consent - in connection with the public strategy for organ donation in Denmark. The pa-per focuses on the democratic compatibility as well as how ethically defensible the given types of nudging are. For this, the paper makes use of two democratic theories of justice from John Rawls and Robert Nozick, respectively, as well as two ethical theories: Kanti-an deontology as well as utilitarianism. It is analyzed how the nudging could be used with respect to increasing the effectiveness of organ donor registration, as well as whether the nudging can be considered compatible and defensible as judged by the theoretical frame-works employed. The paper finds a fundamental dichotomy existing between the chosen theories. To some theories - namely Rawlsâ€™ theory of justice as fairness {{as well as in the}} ethical theory of utilitarianism - usage of both types of nudging can, with some reservations, be considered acceptable. In contrast, the entitlement theory of Robert Nozick, as well as the ethical theory of Kantian deontology, both have a variety of issues concerning the use of <b>nudging</b> - <b>barring</b> both kinds of nudging from being applicable in societies governed by values reflected in these theories. Thus, the compatibility and defensibility of the two kinds of nudging depends on what ethical and democratic views are dominant in the society...|$|R

5000|$|A bullbar or push bumper (also roo bar or <b>nudge</b> <b>bar</b> in Australia, moose bumper in Canada, {{and push}} bar, bull bar, brush guard, grill guard or cattle pusher in the United States) is a device {{installed}} {{on the front of}} a vehicle to protect its front from collisions, whether an accidental collision with a large animal in rural roads, or an intentional collision with another vehicle in police usage. They range considerably in size and form, and are normally composed of welded steel or aluminium tubing, or, more recently, moulded polycarbonate and polyethylene materials. The [...] "bull" [...] in the name refers to cattle, which in rural areas sometimes roam onto rural roads and highways.|$|E
50|$|This {{generation}} of Outback {{was released in}} an early style with gold coloured cladding, all-in-one headlights (not dissimilar to the US model headlights) and internally a light gray cloth (sometimes speckled with various colours), a light brown wood textured dashboard and a plain instrument cluster. A <b>nudge</b> <b>bar</b> (a smaller style of bullbar or roobar) was also available as an aftermarket option. The later style (2002-2004) was updated with silver cladding, an updated range of paint colours, multi-unit headlights (where headlight and indicators were in different sections of the unit) and internally a dark gray/black cloth, dark gray plastics, a very dark brown faint wood texture and metal trims on the dials of the instrument cluster.|$|E
5000|$|The F spans {{two periods}} of 500 production, the D and the L. As such, {{it is the}} most {{frequently}} misidentified model. Between 1965 and 1969 the F carried the same badging as the D, but the two models are distinguishable by the positioning of their door hinges. The D has [...] "suicide doors": the F, produced from June 1965, at last featured front-hinged doors. Between 1969 and 1972 the F was sold alongside the Lusso model as a cheaper [...] "base model" [...] alternative. While the F and L are mechanically very similar, the key differences are the bumpers (the L has an extra chrome <b>nudge</b> <b>bar)</b> and the interior (the F interior is nearly identical to the original 1957 design while the L sports a much more modern look).|$|E
