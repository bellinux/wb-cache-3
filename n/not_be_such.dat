2500|$|Insulation is the [...] "cheapest" [...] way to {{maintain}} a fairly constant body temperature, without consuming energy to produce more body heat. Therefore, the possession of hair or fur would be good evidence of homeothermy, but would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> strong evidence of a high metabolic rate.|$|E
2500|$|In the Battle of Nish the crusaders were victorious {{and forced}} Kasim Pasha of Rumelia and his co-commander Turahan Bey {{to flee to}} Sofia, Bulgaria to warn Murad of the invasion. However, the two burned all the villages in their path {{in an attempt to}} wear down the crusaders with a {{scorched}} earth tactic. [...] When they arrived in Sofia, they advised the Sultan to burn the city and retreat to the mountain passes beyond, where the Ottoman's smaller army would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a disadvantage.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{going to}} tell them. Perhaps they won't miss it. I {{would not have done}} it if Stanhope had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a beast,' said Herbert.|$|R
5000|$|... 1157 (Hōgen 2, 10th month): The {{foundations}} {{are laid}} {{for a grand}} audience hall (dairi) in the palace. There had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a structure within the palace compound {{since the time of}} Emperor Shirakawa.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{procedural}} {{processes are}} not always necessarily damning in this way. Immanuel Kant, a great influence for Rawls, similarly applies a lot of procedural practice within the practical application of The Categorical Imperative, however, this is indeed not based solely on 'fairness'. Even though an example like the one above regarding the orange would not be something that required the practical application of The Categorical Imperative, it is important [...] to draw distinction between Kant and Rawls, and note that Kant's Theory would not necessarily lead to the same problems Rawls' does— i.e., the cutting in half of the orange. Kant's Theory promotes acting out of Duty— acting for the Summum Bonum for him, The Good Will - and in fact encourages Judgement, too. What this would mean [...] is that {{the outcome of the}} Orange's distribution would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a simple process for Kant as the reason why it would be wanted by both parties would necessarily have {{to be a part of}} the Judgement process, thus eliminating the problem that Rawls' account suffers here.|$|E

60|$|Seventh, Would Jesus Christ {{have mercy}} offered, {{in the first}} place, to the biggest sinners? Then here is ground for those that, as to practice, have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such,</b> to come to him for mercy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Frank, {{thinking}} how very weak was the staff on which his aunt's ambition rested; for Lord Porlock's youthful career had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> as to give unmitigated satisfaction to his parents.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me one thing," [...] said I, [...] "and I will go. If it <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{for what}} you say about your {{position}} in life, and all that--if there had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a place as this inn--then could you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And spend {{thirty or}} forty pounds with the lawyers," [...] said Robinson. [...] "No; we will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> fools as that. But we might {{advertise}} the injury." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a bad idea, Andy," [...] {{returned}} Jack. [...] "Those men, {{backed up}} by Slugger and Nappy, may want to carry things with a high hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Baron of Courtwood {{uttered a}} fierce exclamation. Walter muttered, [...] "Mabel, do <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a meddling fool"; but the King asked, [...] "And who may this same squire be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lavington, {{somewhat}} more softly than usual, said,--'That {{the result of}} this visit had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> as to make a second desirable--that she had no wish to disturb her daughter's mind at such a moment with earthly regrets.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had raised}} himself in bed by starts as he spoke, and now fell back exhausted. He never uttered another word, and died before the dawn. People {{said there had}} <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> an ungenteel death in a good county family for years.|$|R
6000|$|She seemed, in her triumph, to have {{forgotten}} that its father was present, and his impatient speech had certainly <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> as {{to bring it to}} mind; but this was too much, and, starting, he hastily exclaimed, 'Children always do make a fuss about their teeth!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{have this}} upon my mind all day unconfessed,' said Elizabeth; 'besides, Harriet will pester me with entreaties {{as long as}} it is untold. Come, Kitty, do <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a coward.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very unhappy}} {{to have to}} {{struggle}} against my anger and pride every day; if I had been punished for them when I was little they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a trouble to me now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This fellow's {{being here}} may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> {{a bad thing}} for you," [...] remarked Tim Crapsey. [...] "Maybe you can {{impersonate}} him and touch the hotel clerk for a loan of ten or twenty dollars." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, Sir, <b>was</b> I <b>not</b> {{right when}} I said that honour and loyalty are the {{essential}} qualities in our profession?

60|$|The getting of this {{enormous}} creature {{out of the}} water would have been a matter of no small difficulty had there <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a large party present. Even as it was, it took them a considerable time to accomplish this feat, and to cut it up and pack it on the sledges.|$|R
60|$|In {{the course}} of their brief {{acquaintance}} Joan had smiled at Ashe many times, but the conditions governing those occasions had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> as to permit him to be seriously affected. He had <b>been</b> pleased on <b>such</b> occasions; he had admired her smile in a detached and critical spirit; but he had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> overwhelmed by it. The frame of mind necessary for that result had been lacking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tetchen, {{you have}} made me hate you, and {{you have made}} me hate myself. If I had not done that, I should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a coward. Go away. I {{do not want to}} speak to you." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{it could}} <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> {{knowledge}} as this {{that he was}} seeking--the wife of Soames Forsyte sitting in the Park like a common wench! Such thoughts were inconceivable; and from tree to tree, with his noiseless step, he passed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon {{every one}} in the party feels much the same way," [...] Cummings replied grimly. [...] "If it was {{possible}} to find a stream now and then the journey across the range would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a dangerous one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a hideous}} business," [...] the {{magistrate}} said; [...] "there has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a startling crime {{committed in the}} county in all my experience. And to think that Margaret Carne should be the victim, a girl every one liked; it is terrible, terrible. What's your opinion, doctor? Some wandering tramp, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Elmore {{thought a}} long while. Then she said: [...] "Why, of course, Owen, you're right about it. There {{is no other}} way. There couldn't be any {{kindness}} in checking him gradually. But I wish," [...] she added sorrowfully, [...] "that he had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a complete goose; and then {{we could have done}} something with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{wife was}} afraid to write you--so I said with simplicity, [...] "I {{will give you the}} language--and ideas." [...] Through the {{infinite}} grace of God there has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> another insurrection in the family before as followed this. However, the letter was written, and promptly, too--whereas, heretofore she has remained afraid to do such things.|$|R
6000|$|O plump head-waiter at The Cock, [...] To which I most resort, [...] How {{goes the}} time? 'Tis five o'clock.

6000|$|... "That {{man must}} be some {{relative}} to Dave," [...] added Caspar Potts. [...] "There could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a resemblance otherwise. It is undoubtedly the same strain of blood. He may be a father, uncle, cousin, elder brother--there is no telling what; {{but he is a}} relative, I will stake my reputation on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Desperate necessity," [...] he said, [...] "sometimes justifies desperate measures. We need Mannering, {{the country}} and our cause need him. If {{argument}} will not prevail there is one last alternative left to us. It may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> an alternative as we should choose, but beggars must not be choosers. I think that you will know what I mean." ...|$|E
60|$|There had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a merry {{breakfast for}} months. There {{was the old}} {{confusion}} of voices; the boys, Richard, and the doctor had much to talk over of the school doings of this week, and there was nearly as much laughing as in days past. Ethel wondered whether any one but herself observed that the voice most seldom heard was Norman's.|$|R
6000|$|... "You miserable sneak," [...] {{he said to}} Morgan; [...] "the pistol hasn't been loaded these fifteen years, as {{you would}} have known very well, if you had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a coward.
