40|$|All {{suitable}} {{measurements of}} the energy dependence of (n, 2 n) cross sections of all isotopes up to mass 238 have been analyzed. The objectives were to display {{the quality of the}} measured data for each isotope and to examine the systematic dependence of the (n, 2 n) cross section upon N, Z, and A. Graphs and tables are presented of the ratio of the asymptotic (n, 2 n) and <b>nonelastic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> to the neutron-asymmetry parameter (N [...] Z) /A. Similar data are presented for the derived nuclear temperature, T, and level-density parameter, $alpha$, as a function of N, Z, and A. This analysis of the results of over 145 experiments on 61 isotopes is essentially a complete review of the current status of (n, 2 n) cross-section measurements. (auth...|$|E

40|$|Integral {{tests of}} {{evaluated}} ENDF/B high-energy <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> {{have been made}} by comparing measured and calculated neutron leakage flux spectra from spheres of various materials.

We attempt to fit these high precision data using both a semiclassical single phase shift model (nuclear Ramsauer model) as well as a recent global optical model that well reproduces a wide body of neutron scattering observables. At the 5 % uncertainty level, both models produce satisfactory fits. However, neither model gives satisfactory fits to these new precise data.

In this report we describe evaluated <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> and kerma factors for neutrons with incident energies up to 100 MeV on {sup 12 }C. The aim of this effort is to incorporate advanced nuclear physics modeling methods, with new experimental measurements, to generate <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> libraries needed for an accurate simulation of dose deposition in fast neutron therapy. The evaluated libraries are based mainly on nuclear model calculations, benchmarked to experimental measurements where they exist. We use the GNASH code system, which includes Hauser-Feshbach, preequilibrium, and direct reaction mechanisms. The libraries tabulate elastic and <b>nonelastic</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections,</b> angle-energy correlated production spectra for light ejectiles with A{le}and kinetic energies given to light ejectiles and heavy recoil fragments. The major steps involved in this effort are: (1) development and validation of nuclear models for incident energies up to 100 MeV; (2) collation of experimental measurements, including new results from Louvain-la-Nueve and Los Alamos; (3) extension of the Livermore ENDL formats for representing high-energy data; (4) calculation and evaluation of nuclear data; and (5) validation of the libraries.

40|$|Background: α-nucleus {{potentials}} play {{an essential}} role for the calculation of α-induced reaction <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> at low energies in the statistical model. Uncertainties of these calculations are related to ambiguities in the adjustment of the potential parameters to experimental elastic scattering angular distributions and to the energy dependence of the effective α-nucleus potentials. Purpose: The present work studies the total reaction <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> σreac of α-induced reactions at low energies which can be determined from the elastic scattering angular distribution or from the sum over the <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> of all open nonelastic channels. Method: Elastic and inelastic Zn 64 (α,α) Zn 64 angular distributions were measured at two energies around the Coulomb barrier, at 12. 1 and 16. 1 MeV. Reaction <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> of the (α,γ), (α,n), and (α,p) reactions were measured at the same energies using the activation technique. The contributions of missing nonelastic channels were estimated from statistical model calculations. Results: The total reaction <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> from elastic scattering and from {{the sum of the}} <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> over all open nonelastic channels agree well within the uncertainties. This finding confirms the consistency of the experimental data. At the higher energy of 16. 1 MeV, the predicted significant contribution of compound-inelastic scattering to the total reaction <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> is confirmed experimentally. As a by-product it is found that most recent global α-nucleus potentials are able to describe the reaction <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> for Zn 64 around the Coulomb barrier. Conclusions: Total reaction <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> of α-induced reactions can be well determined from elastic scattering angular distributions. The present study proves experimentally that the total <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> from elastic scattering is identical to the sum of <b>nonelastic</b> reaction <b>cross</b> <b>sections.</b> Thus, the statistical model can reliably be used to distribute the total reaction <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> among the different open channels. © 2016 American Physical Society...|$|R
40|$|A baryon {{transport}} code (BRYNTRN) {{has previously}} been veri ed using available Monte Carlo results for a solar- are spectrum as the reference. Excellent results were obtained, but the comparisons were limited to the available data on dose and dose equivalent for moderate penetration studies that involve minor contributions from secondary neutrons. To further verify the code, the secondary energy spectra of protons and neutrons are calculated using BRYNTRN and LAHET (Los Alamos High-Energy Transport code, which is a Monte Carlo code). These calculations are compared for three locations within a water slab exposed to the February 1956 solar-proton spectrum. Reasonable agreement was obtained when various considerations related to the calculational techniques and their limitations were taken into account. Although the Monte Carlo results are preliminary, {{it appears that the}} neutron albedo, which is not currently treated in BRYNTRN, might be a cause for the large discrepancy seen at small penetration depths. It also appears that the <b>nonelastic</b> neutron production <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> in BRYNTRN may underestimate the number of neutrons produced in proton collisions with energies below 200 MeV. The notion that the poor energy resolution in BRYNTRN may cause a large truncation error in neutron elastic scattering requires further study...|$|R
