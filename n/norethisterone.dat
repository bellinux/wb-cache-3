25|$|First {{generation}} COCPs {{are sometimes}} {{defined as those}} containing the progestins noretynodrel, <b>norethisterone,</b> <b>norethisterone</b> acetate, or etynodiol acetate; and sometimes defined as all COCPs containing ≥ 50µg ethinylestradiol.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} COCPs {{are sometimes}} {{defined as those}} containing the progestins norgestrel or levonorgestrel; and sometimes defined as those containing the progestins <b>norethisterone,</b> <b>norethisterone</b> acetate, etynodiol acetate, norgestrel, levonorgestrel, or norgestimate and < 50nbsp&µg ethinylestradiol.|$|E
25|$|In general, pregnane {{derivatives}} (progesterone, dydrogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, etc.) do not virilize even in high dose; testosterone derivatives (ethisterone) and 19-nortestosterone (<b>norethisterone,</b> <b>norethisterone</b> acetate, etc.) generally virilize, {{but there}} are exceptions (e.g. noretynodrel) that do not.|$|E
25|$|Chemists Carl Djerassi, Luis Miramontes, and George Rosenkranz at Syntex in Mexico City had {{synthesized}} {{the first}} orally highly active progestin <b>norethisterone</b> in 1951. Frank B. Colton at Searle in Skokie, Illinois had synthesized the orally highly active progestins noretynodrel (an isomer of <b>norethisterone)</b> in 1952 and norethandrolone in 1953.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Parke-Davis {{revised the}} {{physician}} prescribing information for Norlutin (<b>norethisterone)</b> and Norlutate (<b>norethisterone</b> acetate) {{to remove their}} indications for use in infertility, habitual abortion and threatened abortion, and add pregnancy as a contraindication to their use because {{of the possibility of}} masculinization of external genitalia of the female fetus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Norethisterone</b> (NET), {{also known}} as norethindrone, is a {{medication}} that is used in combination with estrogen or alone in hormonal contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and {{in the treatment of}} gynecological disorders. It is a synthetic progestogen (or a progestin) of the 19-nortestosterone group and has similar effects to those of natural progesterone, including suppression of gonadotropins, ovulation inhibition, and endometrial transformation. In addition to its progestogenic activity, NET also has weak androgenic and estrogenic effects at high dosages. In addition to NET itself, several prodrugs of NET, such as <b>norethisterone</b> acetate (NETA), <b>norethisterone</b> enanthate (NETE), and others, have been marketed and have similar effects and uses.|$|E
25|$|In December 1954, Rock {{began the}} first {{studies of the}} ovulation-suppressing {{potential}} of 5–50mg doses of the three oral progestins for three months (for 21 days per cycle—days 5–25 followed by pill-free days to produce withdrawal bleeding) in fifty of his infertility patients in Brookline, Massachusetts. <b>Norethisterone</b> or noretynodrel 5mg doses and all doses of norethandrolone suppressed ovulation but caused breakthrough bleeding, but 10mg and higher doses of <b>norethisterone</b> or noretynodrel suppressed ovulation without breakthrough bleeding {{and led to a}} 14% pregnancy rate in the following five months. Pincus and Rock selected Searle's noretynodrel for the first contraceptive trials in women, citing its total lack of androgenicity versus Syntex's <b>norethisterone</b> very slight androgenicity in animal tests.|$|E
25|$|A {{clinical}} trial {{published in the}} October 1962 American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology reported fetal masculinization of external genitalia of 14 of 59 female infants (24%) born to mothers who began high-dose (10–40mg/day) <b>norethisterone</b> treatment to prevent miscarriage in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (11 infants had slight clitoral enlargement, 1 had marked clitoral enlargement, 2 infants had marked clitoral enlargement and partial fusion of the labioscrotal folds); fetal masculinization of external genitalia of 1 of 23 female infants born to mothers who began high-dose (10–40mg/day) <b>norethisterone</b> treatment to prevent miscarriage after the 12th week of pregnancy (1 infant with slight clitoral enlargement was born to a mother who began <b>norethisterone</b> treatment in week 13).|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that progesterone could prevent threatened abortion and might prevent habitual abortion, but oral bioavailability of progesterone {{is low and}} injections of progesterone can be painful, so orally active progestins were tried beginning with ethisterone, followed by other progestins as they became available: northynodrel (Enovid) and <b>norethisterone</b> (Norlutin) in 1957, medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) in 1959, <b>norethisterone</b> acetate (Norlutate) in 1961, and dydrogesterone (Duphaston) in 1962.|$|E
25|$|The first oral {{contraceptive}} introduced outside the United States was Schering's Anovlar (<b>norethisterone</b> acetate 4mg + ethinylestradiol 50µg) on January 1, 1961 in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone is {{relatively}} safe and well tolerated, {{and does not}} exhibit the androgenic side effects that are common with some other progestins, like medroxyprogesterone acetate and <b>norethisterone.</b>|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} many {{formulations}} of estradiol combined with one of various progestins, such as <b>norethisterone</b> (in Activelle, Novofem and Cliovelle), levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone (in Indivina), dienogest or drospirenone.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Ciba and Parke-Davis {{added the}} {{reported}} association of ethisterone and <b>norethisterone</b> with masculinization of external genitalia {{of the female}} fetus to the precautions section of their advertisements to physicians and physician prescribing information.|$|E
25|$|The {{first case}} reports of fetal masculinization of {{external}} genitalia of female infants born to mothers treated in pregnancy with high-dose ethisterone (17α-ethinyl-testosterone) and high-dose <b>norethisterone</b> (17α-ethinyl-19-nor-testosterone) to prevent miscarriage {{were published in}} 1957 and 1958, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Pincus {{asked his}} {{contacts}} at pharmaceutical companies {{to send him}} chemical compounds with progestogenic activity. Chang screened nearly 200 chemical compounds in animals and found the three most promising were Syntex's <b>norethisterone</b> and Searle's noretynodrel and norethandrolone.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} progestogens exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor. As a result, they have antigonadotropic effects – that is, they suppress the gonadal production of sex hormones such as androgens. As such, sufficient dosages of progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, megestrol acetate, and MPA, can considerably lower androgen levels. In addition, certain other progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, drospirenone, and nomegestrol acetate, bind to and block the activation of the androgen receptor. On the other hand, certain other progestogens, including 19-nortestosterone derivatives like levonorgestrel, norgestrel, <b>norethisterone,</b> and <b>norethisterone</b> acetate, as well as, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative MPA, have weak androgenic activity because they bind to and activate the androgen receptor similarly to testosterone, and may produce androgenic effects such as acne, hirsutism, and increased sex drive.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{was first}} {{isolated}} in pure form in 1934. It first became {{available as a}} medication later that year. Oral micronized progesterone (OMP), which first allowed progesterone to be taken by mouth, was introduced in 1980. A large number of manufactured progestogens, or progestins, have been derived from progesterone and are used as medications as well. Examples include medroxyprogesterone acetate and <b>norethisterone.</b>|$|E
25|$|In a March 1960 JAMA article, {{pediatric}} endocrinologist Lawson Wilkins at Johns Hopkins {{reported on}} 34 cases of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born from 1950 to 1959 to mothers treated with high-dose (20–250mg/day) ethisterone to prevent miscarriage, and 35 cases of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born from 1957 to 1959 to mothers treated with high-dose (10–40mg/day) <b>norethisterone</b> to prevent miscarriage.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{does not}} bind to the {{androgen}} receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and hence does not possess any direct androgenic or antiandrogenic activity. This {{is in contrast}} to many progestins, such as 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., <b>norethisterone,</b> dienogest) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives (e.g., cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate), which do bind to the AR and have been associated with androgenic or antiandrogenic effects depending on the progestin in question.|$|E
25|$|Noretynodrel (and <b>norethisterone)</b> were {{subsequently}} discovered to be contaminated {{with a small}} percentage of the estrogen mestranol (an intermediate in their synthesis), with the noretynodrel in Rock's 1954–5 study containing 4–7% mestranol. When further purifying noretynodrel to contain less than 1% mestranol led to breakthrough bleeding, it was decided to intentionally incorporate 2.2% mestranol, a percentage that was not associated with breakthrough bleeding, in the first contraceptive trials in women in 1956. The noretynodrel and mestranol combination was given the proprietary name Enovid.|$|E
25|$|The first {{contraceptive}} {{trial of}} Enovid led by Celso-Ramón García and Edris Rice-Wray began in April 1956 in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico.–|isbn=0-19-515456-8}} A second contraceptive trial of Enovid (and <b>norethisterone)</b> led by Edward T. Tyler began in June 1956 in Los Angeles. On January 23, 1957, Searle held a symposium reviewing gynecologic and contraceptive research on Enovid through 1956 and concluded Enovid's estrogen content {{could be reduced}} by 33% to lower the incidence of estrogenic gastrointestinal side effects without significantly increasing the incidence of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of progestins (synthetic progestogens) have been derived from progesterone. They can be {{categorized}} into several structural groups, including derivatives of retroprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-methylprogesterone, and 19-norprogesterone, with a respective example from each group including dydrogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, medrogestone, and promegestone. Quingestrone (progesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether) is among the only examples that {{do not belong to}} any of these groups. Another major group of progestins, the 19-nortestosterone derivatives, exemplified by <b>norethisterone</b> (norethindrone) and levonorgestrel, are not derived from progesterone but rather from testosterone.|$|E
25|$|In 1949 Djerassi became {{associate}} {{director of research at}} Syntex in Mexico City and remained there through 1951. He has said that one factor influencing him to choose Syntex was that they had a DU spectrophotometer. He worked on a new synthesis of cortisone based on diosgenin, a steroid sapogenin derived from a Mexican wild yam. His team later synthesized <b>norethisterone</b> (norethindrone), the first highly active progestin analogue that was effective when taken by mouth. This became part of one of the first successful combined oral contraceptive pills, known colloquially as the birth-control pill, or simply, the Pill. From 1952–1959 he was professor of chemistry at Wayne State University in Detroit.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for <b>norethisterone</b> and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E
2500|$|Another medical use of <b>norethisterone</b> is to {{alleviate}} endometriosis related pain. In fact, 50% {{of patients who}} received medical or surgical treatment for endometriosis-related pelvic pain have benefited from progestin therapy. This {{could be due to}} the fact that <b>norethisterone</b> induces endometrial proliferation during secretory phase, which has been shown {{to alleviate}} endometrial pain complaints. Another way in which <b>norethisterone</b> may be acting to reduce endometrial pain is via inhibition of ovulation. Endometriosis pain and discomfort is worse during ovulation.|$|E
