Titanium composites reinforced with SiC particulates {{have also been}} prepared. In order to restrict the detrimental reactions between SiC and Ti during the fabrication, electroless nickel plating has been applied {{on the surface of}} SiC. Four different routes have been employed to produce the Ti specimens from Ti/TiH 2 mixture through Sintering-HIP techniques. Route 1 : Ti/TiH 2 mixture was vacuum-sintered at 1200 °C for 120 min and then HIP was employed at 1000 °C for 120 min under 150 MPa. Route 2 : Vacuum-sintering was performed at 1200 °C for 90 min, followed by HIP at 1000 °C for 90 min, under 150 MPa. Route 3 : Vacuum-sintering was accomplished at 1100 °C for 90 min and followed by HIP at 1000 °C for 90 min under 150 MPa. Route 4 included vacuum-sintering at 1100 °C for 90 min, followed by HIP at 1000 °C for 90 min under 100 MPa. It was found that the densification and hardness of the blended Ti parts increased with increasing amounts of TiH 2 added. The grain refinement of the product was also achieved {{as a result of the}} TiH 2 addition. Containerless HIP of pure Ti (500 mesh) cannot be carried out at a temperature lower than 1100 °C because of the presence of surface connecting porosity. When pure Ti with a size of 250 mesh was used, a temperature of more than 1200 °C was required for containerless HIP. This illustrated the advantageous effect of TiH 2 blending. In addition, the compacts of large size particles required a higher sintering temperature to reach the same density as that of compacts using finer powders. Route 4 has been identified as the optimized processing route for fabrication of Ti products via Sinter-HIP. Moreover, the hardness of the final products was increased as TiH 2 was added, owing to the grain size refinement and improved densification. Unfortunately, electroless Ni plating of SiC reinforcement was found to be of little use. When nickel layer was deposited on SiC, reactions still exists between SiC and Ti. But the reaction zone was smaller compared to those without <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> on <b>SiC.</b> This may be attributed to the dissolution of Ni into Ti matrix at high temperature; hence the effect of protection was lost...|$|R

40|$|Department of Nuclear EngineeringIn {{secondary}} {{system of}} pressurized water reactors (PWRs), carbon steel undergoes severe corrosion owing to high temperature and pressure, and fast flow velocity. These circumstance, named as flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC), induces corrosion and eventually failure of power piping. Flow velocity brings about destruction of oxide layer by electrochemical corrosion and mechanical shear stress at the oxide/water interfaces. The piping {{system in the}} secondary circuit of PWRs mainly consists of carbon steels being vulnerable to FAC because Fe, main element of carbon steel, forms Fe 3 O 4 dissolved to secondary water system by changing to Fe ion. To mitigate corrosion of carbon steel, chemical and mechanical treatments to carbon steel or changing secondary water chemistry has been widely studied. Addition of Cr and/or Mo to carbon steel components {{is one of the}} adequate countermeasure to mitigate FAC by anodic passivation. Mechanical treatments are controlling surface roughness because reducing surface roughness can decrease flow turbulence at the oxide/water interface. Increasing pH, dissolved oxygen contents, and addition of advanced corrosion inhibitor to secondary system can decrease corrosion rate of carbon steels. However, maintaining homogeneous chemistry condition of water is hardly possible and changing chemical composition of carbon steel needs not only research of corrosion properties but also other mechanical properties. In contrast, application of coatings to the steel surface can be easily applied to the secondary system. Therefore, thermal spray to steel surface using less corrosive metal is widely used. Among them, cold spray has advantage with lower process temperature than that of other spray coatings which leads to low residual stress and oxidation or decarburization of coating. In this study, tungsten carbide (WC) and nickel (Ni) particles are used as feedstock materials for the coating. WC exhibits high corrosion resistance in acidic aqueous media due to the phase stability. Moreover, the oxidation resistance of WC in O 2 containing atmosphere at high temperature is applied to industry which is exposed to severe corrosive environments However, in alkaline solution, the dissolution of WC increases by forming WO 4 -. Moreover, high melting temperature and poor plastic deformation make cold spray coating difficult. To suppress the corrosion of and increase the deposition efficiency of the <b>coating,</b> <b>Ni,</b> which has better plastic deformation and lower corrosion potential and melting temperature than WC, is used as a binder metal. Ni acts like a sacrificial metal to WC so corrosion and oxidation of Ni occur before those of WC. To evaluate the potential of the coating as an effective corrosion barrier, series of corrosion tests at simulated secondary water chemistry is carried out and quantitative analysis is conducted. Surface and cross-section morphologies of the coatings before and after FAC simulation tests is investigated by scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron microscopy. Electrochemical experiments are carried out for quantitative analysis. Cold spray coatings using WC- 10 Ni with different Ni contents have rough and porous surface but significant changes of surface is not observed by SEM image. However, lower current density is measured at 25 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> than carbon steel, P 22, 20 Ni and 30 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> from potentiodynamic polarization experiments in pH 9. 3 ETA solution at room temperature. After 2 weeks FAC experiments, weight loss of coating is increased with increases <b>Ni</b> contents in <b>coating</b> but weight of 20 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> is increased. On the other hands, weight loss occurs at 20 Ni and 30 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> and weight of 25 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> is increased after 4 weeks FAC experiments. Although weight change of coatings is smaller than carbon steel after 2 weeks and 4 weeks FAC experiments, weight change of 25 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> shows better corrosion performance than P 22 comparing with 20 Ni and 30 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating.</b> As a result, Ni has lower corrosion potential than WC and it induces galvanic corrosion of Ni and prevents WC corrosion or oxidation at early stage of corrosion process. Moreover, oxidation product of Ni, Ni(OH) 2 is dissolved into water by Ni ion because of poor thermal stability of Ni(OH) ¬ 2. Therefore, high <b>Ni</b> contents in <b>coating</b> increases weight loss during the early stages by Ni(OH) 2 dissolution. However, after 4 weeks of immersion, WC oxidizes and transforms into WO 3 increasingly which is influenced by Ni contents. 30 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> induces continuous weight loss during FAC simulation because of low WC contents which means weight gain by WO 3 formation is smaller than weight loss by Ni(OH) 2 dissolution. Therefore, weight loss occurs at 30 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating.</b> Contrarily, 20 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> do not protect WC dissolution after 2 weeks because the absence of Ni and Ni(OH) 2. accelerates WC oxidation and WO 3 dissolution to water. To be concluded, WC- 10 Ni + 25 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> specimens exhibit the best corrosion resistive performance, the lower corrosion current density and the small weight change than other coatings. Therefore, WC- 10 Ni + 25 <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> is possibly suggested to one of the option to mitigate corrosion of carbon steels. ope...|$|R

While specimen temperature during coating has little effect on deposition rate, it significantly affects the durability of the coating. Scratch test damage to both film coating and substrate decreased with increasing deposition temperature, perhaps due to the rapid diffusion of the deposited atoms...|$|R
40|$|Electroplating {{composite}} coating is {{an effective}} method to prepare composite coating through the codeposition of metallic, nonmetallic, or polymer particles with metal to improve properties such as corrosion resistance, hardness, and wear performance. This paper reports the synthesis of a novelNi-BaFe 12 O 19 magnetic nanocomposite coating exhibiting improved corrosion resistance. In the present paper, BaFe 12 O 19 particles were synthesized by a single-step solution combustion method and characterized for phase, particle size, and morphology. These particles were incorporated in a nickel metal matrix, and {{the properties of the}} coatings like nanohardness and corrosion resistance were investigated. The coating microstructure was also studied using field emission scanning electron microscope. A Vickers hardness of 7 77 HV was exhibited by Ni-BaFe 12 O 19, and plain <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> exhibited a hardness of 517 HV. The Ni-BaFe 12 O 19 composite coating exhibited improved corrosion resistance compared to plain <b>Ni</b> <b>coating...</b>|$|R
40|$|Brass is a {{versatile}} alloy suitable for making engineering components exposed to aqueous and marine environments. A failed <b>Ni</b> <b>coated</b> brass nut {{that was a}} part of a dolphin striker used in a sailing boat is analysed here. Preliminary investigation suggested that the fracture was brittle with no visible evidence of plastic deformation. Microhardness indicated that the general mechanical integrity was intact with hardness of 190 HV across random sections and this is consistent with expectation for high strength brass alloy. Point probe Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis provided evidence of dealloying through electrochemical loss of Zn. EDS of stains on <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> indicated the presence of Zn as corrosion and Cr as corrosion products. It was confirmed that a selective loss of Zn occurred from the underlying brass body through “gates” provided from damage of the normally protective Ni layer. Such selective loss of zinc due to corrosion attack would have led to loss of strength. However, the examination of fractured section suggested an intergranular brittle fracture. The finite element analysis (FEA) showed a maximum tensile stress of 90 MPa in the fracture region which is well below the expected fracture strength. It is therefore concluded that failure of the piece was due to a combined mechanism of dezincification followed by a stress provoked brittle fracture process. It is also proposed that such failures could be avoided by alloy design and surface treatment methods to harden the <b>Ni</b> <b>coating...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties like hardness, tensile strength, wear resistance of electro-co-deposited Ni-SiC coatings {{are dependent on}} factors like bath temperature, current density, duration of deposition, amount of SiC particles etc. Ni-SiC nano composite coatings were prepared on a mild steel substrate by electro-co-deposition process. In this study, the effect of electrochemical bath parameters such as bath temperature, current density and SiC loading were varied and effect of this variation on the coating thickness and tensile strength of Ni-SiC composite coating was studied. The experimental results showed that, a uniform deposit thickness was obtained for 3 A/dm 2 current density, temperature of 55 °C and loading of 4 g/l. A peak value of coating thickness was observed at a current density of 4 A/dm 2 from the experiment. The experimental results also showed that, the tensile strength of the composite <b>coating</b> containing <b>SiC</b> the is significantly higher than pure <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> and the tensile strength increases {{with an increase in}} the percentage of SiC particles in Ni-SiC coatings. The tensile strength of the composite coating increased by nearly about 52 % with increasing SiC loading and then decreased...|$|R
40|$|Anti-corrosive and {{anti-bacterial}} {{properties of}} electrodeposited nanocrystalline Ni-Ag coatings are illustrated. Pure Ni, Ni- 7 at. % Ag, & Ni- 14 at. % Ag coatings were electrodeposited on Cu substrate. Coating consisted of Ni-rich and Ag-rich solid solution phases. With {{increase in the}} Ag content, the corrosion resistance of the Ni-Ag coating initially increased and then decreased. The initial increase {{was due to the}} Ni-Ag solid solution. The subsequent decrease was due to the increased galvanic coupling between the Ag-rich and Ni-rich phases. For all Ag contents, the corrosion resistance of the Ni-Ag coating was higher than the pure <b>Ni</b> <b>coating.</b> Exposure to Sulphate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) revealed that the extent of bio-fouling decreased with increase in the Ag content. After 2 month exposure to SRB, the Ni-Ag coatings demonstrated less loss in corrosion resistance (58 % for Ni- 7 at. % Ag and 20 % for Ni- 14 at. % Ag) when compared pure <b>Ni</b> <b>coating</b> (115 %).
