They {{previously}} collaborated with Jack Pendarvis and Adam Muto {{to come up with}} the idea for the episode, with the former duo adapting that to a storyboard. The creator of Adventure Time, Ward resigned from his occupation as its runner during production of the season. Osborne is the head of story. Alluding to the episode, for Hulu, Muto and Osborne summarized it as Lumpy confounding the concept of time travel. The writers related the episode to [...] "one of those situations where you run into someone from high school and you're like, 'Woah, why didn't I ever <b>notice</b> <b>you</b> before? Alluded to in this episode, the one it precedes involves time travel as well.|$|E
2500|$|Vandenbroucke and Pinacci {{eventually}} divorced, and the Belgian {{struggled to}} establish a more tranquil, less-public life. He resided for a time with a couple in Eeklo who had taken him in after earlier rows with his wife, before moving-on to stay with other friends. His parents, who run a bar and his supporters' club in Ploegsteert - membership dropped from 300 to 145 between 2005 and 2006 although 600 bought [...] "Franky is for ever" [...] T-shirts - said in 2006 that they had heard little from their son since he left Belgium for Italy. His wife had visited twice, to present her husband's new clothing collection, but not to see Vandenbroucke. In 2005, he and his estranged wife and their daughter had a weekend at Eurodisney in Paris. Supporters in the Frankyboys fan club at the café 't Parkske in Oudenaarde said Vandenbroucke {{had never been to}} see them, [...] "although he said a couple of times that he would come but then never did." [...] The chairman of the Frankyboys, Adelin de Meulemeester, said: [...] "You can see him one day and he'll give you a friendly hello, then the next he won't even <b>notice</b> <b>you</b> [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Just as Tyler is {{difficult}} to categorize as a novelist, it is also challenging to label her style. Novelist Cathleen Schine describes how her “style without a style” manages to pull the reader into the story: “So rigorous and artful is the style without a style, so measured and delicate is each observation, so complex is the structure and so astute and open the language, that the reader can relax, feel secure in the narrative and experience the work as something real and natural -- even inevitable.” [...] The San Francisco Chronicle made a similar point: “One does not so much read a Tyler novel as visit it. Her ability to conduct several conversations at once while getting the food to the table turns the act of reading {{into a kind of}} transport.” [...] Reviewer Tom Shone put it this way: “You’re involved before you ever <b>notice</b> <b>you</b> were paying attention.” Joyce Carol Oates, in her review of The Amateur Marriage, perhaps described the phenomenon best: “When the realistic novel works its magic, you won’t simply have read about the experiences of ﬁctitious characters, you will have seemed to have lived them; your knowledge of their lives transcends their own, for they can only live in chronological time. The experience of reading such ﬁction when it’s carefully composed can be breathtaking, like being given the magical power of reliving passages of our own lives, indecipherable at the time of being lived.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The house detective. It's my {{business}} to watch things. So I <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> {{talking to the}} police officer; I also noticed the patrol wagon standing {{on the opposite side}} of the street for nearly an hour--my report on that will amuse them at headquarters, won't it? And I <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> nod to the bruiser, just as your victim came out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What about Benson? I <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> didn't seem {{particularly}} anxious to renew your acquaintance. Are {{you willing to}} leave him with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you. I {{promise you}} shall never regret it. And the sprained ankle? It must be well, as I <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> danced beautifully." ...|$|R
60|$|CANDIDA. Don't be afraid. They'll be {{too busy}} looking at James to <b>notice</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{loved you}} so, {{and was always}} as pleased as a child with any <b>notice</b> <b>you</b> took of her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, do {{you know}} Uncle Dan begins to <b>notice</b> <b>you.</b> He asked me to-day what you were hanging round here for, and who you were." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{what about}} Benson? I <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> didn't seem {{particularly}} anxious to renew your acquaintance. Are {{you willing to}} leave him with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] {{said the}} second man. [...] "I <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> were walking lame. We're well stocked in {{groceries}} and Steve got a deer {{a day or}} two ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} back from Forster's when I <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> moving about the hills," [...] she explained. [...] "I made this round {{to find out what}} you were doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{one person}} in all this, my lord Marquis," [...] he said, [...] "whom I <b>notice</b> <b>you</b> and His Eminence scarce trouble to think about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just the same, I <b>notice</b> <b>you</b> ain't tumbled over {{yourself}} to get married," [...] Shorty remarked, continuing {{a conversation that}} had lapsed some few minutes before.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I <b>notice</b> <b>you</b> have an {{affinity}} for grubbing in the banquet hall after the guests have fled,' says I to him one day, to draw his conclusions.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was <b>noticing</b> <b>you</b> {{the other}} day, ma’am," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Wiggett. [...] "I see you {{going up the}} road with a step free and easy as a young girl’s." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it {{was none}} of us," [...] said Patsy. [...] "Miss Stanton--Maud Stanton--swam out to <b>you,</b> when she <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> were struggling, and kept you afloat until we--until help came." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Bob, you {{are looking}} a little pale, but so is {{everybody}} else; and no wonder, with this heat. But I have not been <b>noticing</b> <b>you,</b> particularly. What do you feel, Bob?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sandy, {{out with}} it. Come--no secrets among friends. I <b>notice</b> <b>you</b> don't ever wear wings--and plenty others don't. I've been making an ass of myself--is that it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hang you, I {{might have}} lost you! Children are the heedlessest creatures. But look here, friend, {{the boy did}} not seem to <b>notice</b> <b>you</b> at all; how is that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; you {{can send}} Beatrice to give her <b>notice,</b> <b>you</b> know. She never was unreasonable, and I {{do not think that}} you would find her so. You should tell her, you know--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure. No. Really. Sure I do. Why not? Don't think I'm kidding you, honey, {{but every}} time I've <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> I've said to myself, 'That kid has Blue Blood in her veins!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{he said he}} was {{recommended}} here by a friend of yours. He <b>noticed</b> <b>you,</b> but said that as he had not the pleasure of your personal acquaintance he would not trouble you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel certain that's your line. I've often <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> {{walking over}} to school, looking exactly like a blood-hound. Get to work. As a start you'd better fetch Evans up here and {{question}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, your orders {{cannot be}} obeyed," [...] cried Sam in surprise. [...] "Where am I {{to find a}} bride on such short <b>notice?</b> <b>You</b> are more {{unreasonable}} than the most tyrannical of sultans." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I {{recognised}} the mark," [...] {{the other}} replied. [...] "A most outrageous mistake! I am very glad {{that it came}} under my <b>notice.</b> <b>You</b> are absolutely free from the censor, Sir Alfred." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In short, Ma,' said Lavvy, {{bouncing}} over to {{the enemy}} without a word of <b>notice,</b> <b>you</b> must know very well--or if you don't, more shame for you!--that Mr and Mrs Boffin are just absolute perfection.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One time I says to her: 'Do I {{remind you}} of some {{deceased}} relative or friend of your childhood, Mrs. Brown? I've <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> give me a pretty good optical inspection from time to time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Harry {{remembered that}} he'd want the wagon to-morrow, and there's a bolt loose," [...] he explained. [...] "It didn't seem to occur to {{him until he}} <b>noticed</b> <b>you.</b> I suppose one could call it a coincidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; for {{the first}} time we <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> in the Magic Picture, you were just a bird, as you are now. But we've guessed that the giant woman had {{transformed}} you, as she did the others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{apologize}} for Stephen," [...] he said. [...] "He {{is a little}} crotchety. You must please be kind and not <b>notice.</b> <b>You</b> must let me, if I can, offer you welcome enough for us both." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is unlucky. But you {{may make}} her {{understand}} you {{by means of}} French. Take <b>notice,</b> <b>you</b> are to comply with her request in everything--if you want means to do so, you may apply to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{exactly the}} <b>notice</b> <b>you</b> were to receive, Lady Dedlock, because the {{contemplated}} notice supposed {{the agreement to}} have been observed. But virtually the same, virtually the same. The difference is merely in a lawyer's mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> 'adn't 'ad {{anything}} to eat, an' I spoke to Gumbly, an' {{he said you}} wasn't exactly cut off from supplies. So I brought up this. It's your potted 'am tin, ain't it, Mr. Corkran?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That’s {{where the}} nests are," [...] said Mr. Tasker, [...] "but I wasn’t looking {{in at the}} window. Besides, I <b>noticed</b> <b>you</b> always pulled the blind down when you saw me looking, so I thought it didn’t matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|JAMES. You've {{still got}} a sense of your superiors. Didn't <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> how <b>you</b> moved to Poulder's orders, me boy; an' when he was gone, to mine? ...|$|R
