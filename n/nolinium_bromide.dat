40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>nolinium</b> <b>bromide</b> [2 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenylamino) quinolizium bromide], which {{acts as a}} K+ {{antagonist}} in the gastric H+ +K+-dependent ATPase reaction, was investigated {{at the level of}} 32 P-labelled intermediates of the gastric ATPase reaction. A concentration-dependent effect of <b>nolinium</b> <b>bromide</b> was observed on the concentrations of phosphorylated intermediates. At low (up to 50 microM) concentrations the drug did not interfere with the concentrations of intermediates but exhibited a competition with K+ at the level of both 32 P-labelled intermediates and hydrolysis of ATP at pH 7. 0. Similar competition was noted in the H+ +K+-dependent ATPase reaction. Low <b>nolinium</b> <b>bromide</b> concentrations also drastically slowed the enzyme turnover. The concentrations of the intermediates were lowered appreciably between 50 microM- and 100 microM-nolinium bromide without affecting the ATP hydrolysis, and the effects were independent of pH. Similar to the effects at pH 7. 0, the drug also exhibited competition with K+ in lowering the E approximately P concentration at pH 5. 0. A dramatic effect of pH on the K+-sensitivity as well as on turnover of the 32 P-labelled intermediates was observed. Although the concentrations of intermediates remained nearly unaltered at various pH values, the K+-stimulated hydrolysis of ATP showed an optimum at pH 7. 0 with sharp declines at pH 5 and 8. The data suggest a critical involvement of H+ in the conversion of the K+-insensitive E 1 approximately P into the K+-sensitive E 2 approximately P form of the enzyme. <b>Nolinium</b> <b>bromide</b> appears to function as a K+ analogue and seems to block the entry of K+ at the K X E 2 step, thereby interfering with the enzyme turnover...|$|E
