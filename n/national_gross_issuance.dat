40|$|This paper {{examines}} Latin America’s {{access to}} international capital markets from 1980 to 2005, with {{particular attention to}} the role of domestic and external factors. To capture access to international markets, we use primary <b>gross</b> <b>issuance</b> in international bond, equity, and syndicated-loan markets. Using panel estimation, we find that sound fundamentals matter. For example, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile’s superb performance in capital markets during the early 1990 s has been in large part driven by better fundamentals. However, the upsurge in international lending to Latin America starting in 2003 has been mainly driven by a dramatic increase in global liquidity. ...|$|R
