40|$|Abstract. In this paper, I {{explore how}} {{individuals}} form coalitions {{when they make}} their membership decisions dynamically and face social, spatial, and institutional constraints on coalition membership. I introduce a class of games called sequential coalition formation games, in which individuals make their group membership decisions sequentially over time. I show that when individuals are unconstrained in their choice of group, there is a unique equilibrium, which {{does not depend on}} the order of play. This is in contrast with the static formulation of the same game, which will typically have multiple equilibria. However, I show that the unique equilibrium of the sequential game is highly inefficient. Specifically, the negative externality imposed by entering individuals drives players to form groups that are much too large relative to the socially optimal size. I then introduce a <b>network</b> <b>constraint,</b> which limits a player’s action set to those groups that she is connected to on an exogenously-given network. I show that if players ’ action sets are so constrained, it mitigates the tendency for groups to get too large. More specifically, total social welfare depends on network topology in a predictable way–social welfare increases as the network becomes more sparse and more regular. Finally, I show that the optimal insti-tutional design depends on the topology of the <b>network</b> <b>constraint.</b> When the <b>network</b> <b>constraint</b> is dense or random, the Open Membership rule is optimal. Conversely, when <b>network</b> <b>constraint</b> is sparse or highly regular, the Exclusive Membership rule is optimal. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows an}} example of a {{stochastic}} approach to study the impact of distributed generation (DG) on the <b>network</b> <b>constraints</b> (congestions) in power systems. We assume the DG units to be customer-owned, {{so that they can be}} connected to or disconnected from the power system by their owners at random. Therefore, the DG units generate power in a stochastic way. The load in the system shows a random behavior too, and the probability distribution of the aggregated generated power and load demand of the distribution system are calculated using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The <b>network</b> <b>constraints</b> (congestions) are evaluated based on the probability distributions of the power flows that result from the simulations. The method that is applied in this paper, shows that looking at the <b>network</b> <b>constraints</b> with a stochastic approach gives a more complete picture of the network than applying a deterministic method, especially when non-dispatchable DG units play a dominant role...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to show that}} social support created through {{face-to-face}} interaction is a driving factor in a number of important outcomes. Through a series of studies we show that social support, operationalized using face-to-face <b>network</b> <b>constraint</b> (information clearing), is positively related to important outcomes such as productivity and job satisfaction and that changes in social support are positively related to changes in these outcomes. We then discuss a two-phase study where we experimentally modify break structure to increase <b>network</b> <b>constraint</b> and demonstrate a corresponding positive change in outcomes. Finally, we show that <b>network</b> <b>constraint</b> is also qualitatively related to outcomes and is an effective proxy for social support. To conclude we situate this research under a larger framework that provides direction for future research. by Benjamin Nathan Waber. Thesis (Ph. D.)

I introduce a class of games called sequential group formation games, in which players make their group membership decisions sequentially over time, and show that the dynamics act as an equilibrium refinement. However, the resulting equilibrium is highly suboptimal–groups tend to be much too large, relative to the social optimum. I then introduce a <b>network</b> <b>constraint,</b> which limits a player’s action set to those groups that she is connected to on an exogenous network. The <b>network</b> <b>constraint</b> mitigates the tendency for groups to get too large and social welfare is higher when the network is sparse and highly ordered. This result has the surprising implication that informational, institutional, and geographic barriers to group membership may actually improve social welfare by restricting groups from becoming too large. 1...|$|E

40|$|Group {{formation}} {{is an important}} part of many kinds of economic problems, including rent-seeking, resource management, contract bidding, volunteer organization, problem solving, and political lobbying. The current literature on group formation assumes that individuals are unconstrained in their choice of groups–that they may join any existing group. However, instances where group membership decisions are truly unconstrained are rare. Individuals face a wide range of social, geographic, and informational constraints in their group membership decisions. In this paper, I extend the existing group membership models to account for such widespread constraints. I imbed the players in a network of relationships, which constrains their choice of groups–they may only join a group if that group contains a member that they are connected to on the network. I then examine how this <b>network</b> <b>constraint</b> affects the equilibrium group structure. I show that when payoffs are single-peaked in group size and individuals are unconstrained in their group membership, they will form groups that are much too large, from the standpoint of social welfare. This is due to the externality that new members impose on the group’s existing membership–new members free ride off of the efforts of early group members, and new groups are under-provided. I then consider the effect of a <b>network</b> <b>constraint</b> on equilibrium group structure. I show that when individuals are constrained by their networks, the resulting group structures are much closer to the socially optimal group structure, and thus much more efficient. This is because the <b>network</b> <b>constraint</b> limits the ability of the individual to free ride on the efforts of other group members. The efficiency of the outcome is related to the structure of the network constraint–outcomes are more efficient when networks are sparse and have few random connections...|$|E

40|$|Corporate {{responses}} to illness is currently an ad-hoc, subjective {{process that has}} little basis in data on how disease actually spreads at the workplace. Some businesses emphasize a "tough-itout" approach, implicitly encouraging employees to remain at work while they are sick.
