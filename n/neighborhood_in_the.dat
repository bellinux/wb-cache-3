5|$|After the New York City draft {{riots in}} 1863, Smith {{and his family}} were among {{prominent}} blacks who left New York and moved to Brooklyn, then still a separate city. He no longer felt safe in his old <b>neighborhood.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1870 census, Malvina and her four children were living in Ward 15, Brooklyn. All were listed as white. James W. Smith, who had married a white woman, was living in a separate household and working as a teacher; he was also classified as white. The Smith children still at home were Maud, 15; Donald, 12; John, 10; and Guy, 8; all were attending school. Five Smith children survived to adulthood: James, Maud, Donald, John and Guy. The men married white spouses, but Maud never married. All were classified as white from 1860 on.|$|E

5|$|An Israeli {{reserve unit}} {{was called in}} from Tiberias. It arrived after twenty minutes and took {{positions}} around the town. At that point, Samakh (Tzemah) was defended by three platoons from the Barak battalion and reinforcements from neighboring villages. They entrenched in the actual village, which had been abandoned by the residents in April 1948, with British escort. Positions in the village included the police station in the west, the cemetery in the north, the Manshiya <b>neighborhood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south, and the railway station. The Syrians set up their positions in an abandoned British military base {{just east of the}} village and in an animal quarantine station to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Evans' {{service as}} Imperial Wizard {{proved to be}} a lucrative position, {{allowing}} him to maintain a large residence in a prestigious Atlanta <b>neighborhood.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mid-1930s, however, Klan funds dwindled, and he worked for a Georgia-based construction company selling products to the Georgia Highway Board. At the same time, he was a staunch supporter of Georgia governor Eurith D. Rivers, whom he had previously employed as a lecturer. Owing to the political support that he provided the administration, Evans was allowed to sell to the highway board without bidding against other contractors. In 1940, the state of Georgia charged Evans {{and a member of the}} state highway board with price fixing. The Attorney General of Georgia, Ellis Arnall, directed legal proceedings against Evans that resulted in a $15,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University {{has four}} campuses in Washington, D.C.: the {{undergraduate}} campus, the Medical Center, the School of Continuing Studies (in Chinatown) and the Law Center.

5|$|Guy B., born 1862, first {{worked as}} a seaman. By 1900, he was married with several {{children}} and {{worked as a}} salesman. His youngest daughter was named Antoinette. In 1850, the senior Smith's household included four older women: Lavinia Smith, age 67 (his mother: b. c.1783 - d. bet.1860-1870), born in South Carolina and listed first as head of household; Sarah Williams, 57; Amelia Jones, 47; and Mary Hewlitt, 53, who were likely relatives or friends. By then Smith and his wife Malvina had three children: James, Henry and Amy. Each member of the household was classified as mulatto (or of mixed ancestry), and all but Lavinia Smith were born in New York. They lived in a mixed <b>neighborhood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Ward; in the census, nearly all other neighbors on the page were classified as white; many were immigrants from England, Ireland, and France.|$|E

Bagg Commemorative Park and Bagg's Square West (Utica's historic centers) are in the northeastern portion of downtown, with Genesee Street on the west and Oriskany Street on the south.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Joaquín {{purchased}} land on {{the outskirts}} of Guadalajara with the intent of forming a small community made up exclusively by members of LLDM. The land was then sold at reduced prices to church members. The community included most necessities; services provided in Hermosa Provincia included health, education, and other urban services, which were provided in full after six years partly with help that the Church received from municipal and non-municipal authorities. This dependency upon outside assistance to obtain public services ended by 1959 when residents formed the Association of Colonists of Hermosa Provincia, which was used to directly petition the government. Hermosa Provincia received a white flag from the city for being the only <b>neighborhood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city that has eliminated illiteracy by the early 1970s. Joaquín started missionary efforts in Central America and by the early 1960s, La Luz del Mundo had 64 congregations and 35 missions. By 1964, after his death, the Church had between 20,000 and 30,000 members spread through five countries, including Mexico. The neighborhood became a standard model for the Church which has replicated it in many cities in Mexico and other countries.|$|E

5|$|Sutner {{defines a}} {{directed}} graph (a type of de Bruijn graph) {{in which each}} vertex represents a pair of assignments of states for the cells in a contiguous sequence of cells. The length of this sequence is chosen to be one less than the neighborhood size of the automaton. An edge in Sutner's graph represents a pair of sequences of cells that overlap {{in all but one}} cell, so that the union of the sequences is a full <b>neighborhood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cellular automaton. Each such edge is directed from the overlapping subsequence on the left to the subsequence on the right. Edges are only included in the graph when they represent compatible state assignments on the overlapping parts of their cell sequences, and when the automaton rule (applied to the neighborhood determined by the potential edge) would give the same results for both assignments of states. By performing a linear-time strong connectivity analysis of this graph, it is possible to determine which of its vertices belong to cycles. The transition rule is non-injective if and only if this graph contains a directed cycle in which at least one vertex has two differing state assignments.|$|E
