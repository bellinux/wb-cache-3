25|$|Unlike these earlier shows, Moonlighting {{sometimes}} {{broke the}} fourth wall {{in much more}} involved and complex ways. Cold opens sometimes featured Shepherd and Willis (in character as Maddie Hayes and David Addison), other actors, viewers, or TV critics directly addressing the audience about the show's production itself. These cold opens were originally born out of desperation {{as a way to}} fill air time, since the dialogue on the show was spoken so quickly and the producers <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> fill the entire hour. In some other episodes, the plot suddenly changed into extended sequences that involved crew dismantling or changing the sets, characters wandering off the set into other parts of the studio, production crew stepping into the scene as a deus ex machina (e.g. a propmaster suddenly walking into the scene and taking the villain's gun away), or guest actors dropping character and referring to each other by their real names. However, other than in stand-alone openings, the main actors never stepped out of character during the episodes.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, [...] "I think {{at some point}} along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people {{something}} to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren’t always easy, but I think we found a way." ...|$|E

500|$|Howard R. Cohen {{learned from}} Charles B. Griffith {{that when the}} film was being edited, [...] "there was a point where two scenes would not cut together. It was just a visual jolt, and it didn't work. And they <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> bridge that moment. They found in the editing room a nice shot of the moon, and they cut it in, and it worked. Twenty years go by. I'm at the studio one day. Chuck comes running up to me, says, 'You've got to see this!' It was a {{magazine}} article—eight pages on {{the symbolism of the}} moon in Little Shop of Horrors." [...] According to Corman, the total budget for the production was $30,000. Other sources estimate the budget to be between $22,000 and $100,000.|$|E
500|$|Along with Klingon cosmetics, makeup {{supervisor}} Michael J. Mills {{was kept}} busy preparing {{the large number}} of other aliens called for in the script. Mills and his team created the largest makeup endeavor ever seen in a Star Trek film until then; custom makeup was applied to 22 principal actors, and as many as 126 prosthetic makeups each day. Because the alien creatures played such {{an important role in the}} film, there was a concerted push to provide enough money to the makeup department to make sure the complex work was finished. According to Mills, [...] " [...] we could prove to [...] that we <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> get the shot done, then we'd have it." [...] The makeup lab employed a staff of 25 and produced over 300 prosthetics, from Klingon foreheads to Vulcan and Romulan ears. Work on the many extras began as early as one o'clock in the morning to be ready for the eight o'clock call.|$|E
500|$|The idea of Ann {{making out}} with Chris Traeger {{was not part}} of the {{original}} screenplay, but was added after the first cast read-through of the script. The writing staff felt that while Ben was immediately connected to Leslie and the other characters through his role in eliminating wasteful spending at Pawnee, Chris still <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> more strongly connect to the cast, and the subplot with Ann was determined to be a funny way to do it. In one scene, after Ben explains the need for severe budget cuts at Pawnee, Ron asks Leslie, [...] "What's a not gay way to ask him to go camping with me?" [...] That line was not in the first draft of the script, but was added during filming as a possible alternative line for the editors to choose from later. The staff found it so funny, however, that they chose to use it and the original line was never filmed.|$|E

500|$|Nixon and Broderick also crafted the {{character}} as a darkly brooding and mysterious {{man in the}} same vein as gothic literary heroes such as Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights, Edward Rochester from Jane Eyre, and Maxim de Winter from Rebecca. Nixon used these characters as inspiration for Dimitri because, as she told Soap Opera Weekly, [...] "In doing the 'stolen life' story, I felt that we <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> follow that was also a little larger than life, very romantic, and gothic." [...] The characters played a part in shaping Dimitri as well as his environment and storylines. Maxim de Winter's estate, Manderley, provided the inspiration for Dimitri's Pine Valley estate, Wildwind. The design was taken from both the description in Du Maurier's book and the depiction from the film Rebecca, a 1940 adaptation of the novel by Alfred Hitchcock. Like Mr. Rochester, the wife Dimitri falsely claims died years ago is revealed to be alive just before his marriage to another woman.|$|E
500|$|Golder {{identified}} [...] "Esther’s scarily casual death" [...] {{as one of}} the gripping {{points of}} what he felt to be an underwhelming finale. The Daily Telegraphs Gavin Fuller referred to her exit as [...] "being a genuine, and saddening shock." [...] Jeffrey praised the character's death as a [...] "well-handled shocker", noting that all signs had indicated Rex would die instead. He felt it was [...] "cruel trick on the writers' part to off lovely Agent Drummond" [...] and [...] "all the crueler to keep viewings hanging until that first glimpse of her funeral." [...] He concluded by saying that [...] "this kind of emotional sucker-punch" [...] is something Torchwood has always excelled at. Neela Debnath of The Independent commented that her death was sad because the [...] "character went through so much" [...] and that [...] "there would have been room for more growth in subsequent series." [...] Conversely, Los Angeles Times correspondent Todd VanDerWerff opined that it was hard to invest in Esther, in addition to Rex and Oswald, and though her death was intended as the [...] "one big, emotional moment of the finale" [...] it came across to him as [...] "kind of a dud". He felt that throughout the fourth series Esther was used as [...] "simply a plot device, someone the writers used when they <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> go wrong or when they needed the story to move in a certain direction." [...] Blair Marnell of CraveOnline also notes in his review of the series finale that [...] "Rex and Esther never really caught on as leading characters" [...] and felt {{that it would have been}} better had the characters departed in symmetry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{meant to be}} a B-side to [...] "I Want to Give You My Everything" [...] (written by Brooklyn songwriter Larry Weiss and sung by Carl Douglas). The producer Biddu originally hired Douglas to sing [...] "I Want to Give You My Everything" [...] but <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> record for the B-side, and asked Douglas if he had any lyrics they could use. Douglas showed several, out of which Biddu chose the one that would later be called [...] "Kung Fu Fighting" [...] and worked out a melody for it without taking it too seriously.|$|E
5000|$|Hank {{has spoken}} about human dreams of success. On the topic, Hank has stated, [...] "There are {{problems}} with the institutions of dreams, but I am in favor of them. We <b>need</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> push us to work 16-hour days sometimes. We <b>need</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> drive us to be better, and weirder, and different, but I think if we let that one thing drive us, it's a failure of imagination, and we miss opportunities." [...] Hank would add, [...] "In the end, it's not about finding success, it's about building the number of things you're capable of, because then you could do more interesting things, and we need people to do interesting things in the world." ...|$|R

2500|$|Weebl and Bob before 1984 – The episode [...] shows Weebl and Bob before 1984. Weebl and Bob {{were much}} {{different}} in these ways; {{they both had}} mullets, Bob was much larger and they were intelligible. Weebl's yo-yo string had broken, and they <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do. They called their friend, Baldy Lee, who is Hairy Lee and still has hair, and brings cheese with him, which in the video is shown as a profane item, or a drug. All three of them eat the cheese, and seem fine at first and dance to the Chicken Dance. The next day Weebl and Bob turn into what we know of them today.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Access Games {{began work}} on Deadly Premonition, which was {{intended}} to be a reboot of Rainy Woods, although the project faced cancellation four times. The budget for the overall project, according to Suehiro, was [...] "ot very much." [...] Suehiro created a new protagonist, Francis York Morgan, with help from his friends in the United States, and he and Kenji Gota, an independent film director, created York's dialogue with his split personality, Zach. As Gota and Suehiro are good friends and often have conversations about film, Suehiro tried to bring that atmosphere to the dialogue. Additionally, they wrote the main plotline, while Suehiro wrote eighty percent of the sidequests and all of York's conversations with the nonplayer characters. The character Zach was intended to involve the player more in the game; according to Suehiro, [...] "Agent York arrives in Greenvale to solve a murder case. But, the player lives this scene from his living room in front of the TV. To fill this gap, I <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> create the illusion, without turning the character into an avatar, that the user was the main character." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film's {{original}} music segments are a drum score consisting {{entirely of}} solo jazz percussion performances by Antonio Sánchez. The score is offset {{by a number}} of well known classical music pieces, including Mahler and Tchaikovsky. Iñárritu did not regard the particular choice of classical pieces as important. Nonetheless, the choice of classical music was strongly oriented to highly melodic scores taken predominantly from the 19th century classical repertoire (Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Ravel). Iñárritu stated that the classical components come from the world of the play, citing the radio in Riggan's room and the show itself as two sources of the music. The classical music segments also included two compositions by American composer John Adams. Several jazz compositions by Victor Hernández Stumpfhauser and Joan Valent counterbalance the original music composition by Sánchez. The drum sections comprise the majority of the score however, and were composed by Sánchez. Iñárritu explained the choice by saying they helped to structure scenes, and that [...] "The drums, for me, was a great way to find the rhythm of the film... In comedy, rhythm is king, and not having the tools of editing to determine time and space, I knew I <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> help me find the internal rhythm of the film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
