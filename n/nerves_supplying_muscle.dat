40|$|Abstract: The trigeminal <b>nerve</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>muscles</b> {{share many}} traits {{due to their}} common embryological {{derivation}} from the mandibular branchial arch. Many of these muscles, especially the masticatory, exhibit very complex intra- and intermuscular anatomical and functional specializations which continue to be investigated. Two schemes have been proposed to classify the intramuscular and extramuscular slips associated with these muscles: 1) based on recognizable laminae within each muscle; 2) based on the pattern of nerve distribution to definable parts of each muscle. The extramuscular slips have been identified on the bases of their <b>nerve</b> <b>supply.</b> The second scheme is beginning to yield results which confirm Edgeworth’s (1914, 1935) hypothesis regarding the ontogeny and phylogeny of the trigeminal <b>nerve</b> <b>supplied</b> musculature. These advances in the rational classification of these muscles have resulted from improved methods to expose the deeper parts of the masticatory and related spaces. However, because of the piecemeal exposure of parts of the spaces which contain some of the deeper trigeminal muscles there remain several issues that {{still need to be}} resolved. We provide a detailed protocol by which all the trigeminal <b>nerve</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>muscles</b> can be isolated from the upper cranium so that the entire mandibular nerve tree along with its musculature may be described as a connected complex of related structures. The practical and clinical implications of this new methodology are evaluated and discussed...|$|R

40|$|After {{peripheral}} nerve lesions, some axotomized afferent neurons develop ongoing discharges that {{originate in the}} dorsal root ganglion (DRG).

5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck.

Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|R

40|$|The {{amphibian}} opercularis muscle connects a movable otic element (the opercu-lum) to the {{pectoral girdle}} and can act in reception of ground vibrations. Various physiological {{parameters of the}} opercularis muscle of the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana were measured and compared with similar measurements on the iliofibularis muscle of the hindlimb. The opercularis muscle is a very slowly contracting muscle, with a Vmax of 1 - 81 muscle lengths s" 1 compared to a Vmmx of 6 - 24 muscle lengths s" 1 for the iliofibularis muscle. The opercularis muscle develops tension slowly, taking about 10 s to attain maximum isometric tension when stimulated at 100 Hz. The muscle can retain high levels of tension for several minutes, and following stimulation has a time to half-relaxation of about 4 - 6 s. The slow velocity of contraction, slow rate of tension development, fatigue-resistance and slow rate of relaxation of the opercularis muscle support morphological evidence that it consists mostly of tonic muscle fibres. Experiments were also made {{to examine the effects}} of muscle tension on reception of ground vibrations as measured by inner ear microphonics. Severing the <b>nerve</b> <b>supplying</b> the opercularis <b>muscle</b> produced slight decreases of no more than 2 dB in responses to vibrations from 25 to 200 Hz. Artificial stimulation of the opercularis muscle after severing the <b>nerve</b> <b>supplying</b> the <b>muscle</b> increased responses to vibration across the entire frequency range. Higher tension levels produced greater increases in responses; at the highest tensions used (about 120 kNm~ 2) responses were increased by as much as 45 dB. The opercularis muscle is therefore specialized for slow but prolonged contractions, and tension is important in its sensory function. A tensed opercularis muscle appears to transmit faithfully motion of the forelimb, produced by vibrations, to the operculum such that the latter moves relative to the inner ear fluids...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>nerve</b> <b>supply</b> to coracobrachialis from the brachial plexus in apes was {{investigated}} in 4 arms from 4 chimpanzees, both arms of a gorilla and 4 arms from 4 gibbons. The general architecture of the brachial plexus {{was the same as}} in the human. In the apes examined, the <b>nerves</b> <b>supplying</b> this <b>muscle</b> could be classified into 2 groups: (1) distal branches arising from the musculocutaneous nerve, and (2) proximal branches arising in the region of the lateral cord. On the basis of their origin and course, the proximal branches were classified into 3 types, namely a deep ramus arising from the middle trunk and passing dorsal to the upper trunk, a medial ramus arising from the upper trunk in the lateral cord, and a superficial ramus arising from the ventral surface of the middle trunk or the root of the pectoral nerve. This classification also applies to branches to coracobrachialis in man. The 3 types of proximal branch often communicated with each other to supply coracobrachialis, whereas the proximal and distal branches were separated from each other spatially. This indicates that coracobrachialis possesses characteristics both of the pectoral girdle muscles and the flexor muscles of the upper arm...|$|R

The term megarectum is also used for a large rectal mass on rectal examination, a wide rectum on an abdominal x-ray, the presence of impaired rectal sensation or the finding of large maximal rectal volumes on anorectal manometry. In addition, can be the bloating of the colon due to infection, also called megacolon. On defecography, megarectum is suggested by a rectal width of >9 cm {{at the level of the}} distal sacrum.|$|R
40|$|Adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) is a cotransmitter with {{classical}} transmitters in most nerves in {{the peripheral}} and central nervous systems, although the proportions vary between tissues and species {{and in different}} developmental and pathophysiological circumstances. There was early evidence that ATP was released together with acetylcholine (ACh) from motor <b>nerves</b> <b>supplying</b> skeletal <b>muscle,</b> although it was considered {{at the time as}} a molecule involved in the vesicular uptake and storage of ACh. Later it was shown that in the developing neuromuscular junction, released ATP acted on P 2 X receptor ion channels as a genuine cotransmitter with ACh. Adenosine triphosphate was shown to be released from sympathetic <b>nerves</b> <b>supplying</b> the guinea-pig taenia coli in 1971. Soon after, the possibility was raised that ATP was coreleased with noradrenaline from sympathetic nerves to guinea-pig seminal vesicle, cat nictitating membrane and guinea-pig vas deferens. Sympathetic purinergic cotransmission has also been demonstrated in many blood vessels. Parasympathetic <b>nerves</b> <b>supplying</b> the urinary bladder use ACh and ATP as cotransmitters; ATP acts through P 2 X ionotropic receptors, whereas the slower component of the response is mediated by the metabotropic muscarinic receptor. Adenosine triphosphate and glutamate appear to be cotransmitters in primary afferent sensory neurons. Adenosine triphosphate, calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P coexist in some sensory-motor nerves. A subpopulation of intramural enteric nerves provides non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic inhibitory innervation of gut smooth muscle. Three cotransmitters are involved, namely ATP, nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. In recent years, studies have shown that ATP is released with ACh, noradrenaline, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, 5 -hyroxytryptamine and dopamine in different subpopulations of neurons in the central nervous system...|$|R
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, <b>supplying</b> the <b>muscles</b> of the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers {{travel in the}} vagus <b>nerve</b> to <b>supply</b> the <b>muscles.</b> The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that <b>supply</b> the smooth <b>muscle</b> and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance {{the function of the}} vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is <b>supplied</b> by both <b>nerves,</b> with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} the organophosphorus (OP) insecticide chlorpyrifos potentiates vagally induced bronchocon-striction independent of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition by decreasing the function of neuronal M 2 muscarinic receptors that normally inhibit acetylcholine release from parasympathetic <b>nerves</b> <b>supplying</b> airway smooth <b>muscle.</b> However, {{it has been reported}} that different OPs may not affect muscarinic receptors equally. To determine if the effects of chlorpyrifos on airway hyper-reactivity can be generalized to other OPs, we tested whether para-thion and diazinon also inhibit neuronal M 2 receptor function resulting in airway hyperreactivity. In control animals, the M 2 agonist pilocarpine inhibits vagally induced bronchoconstriction in a dose-related manner. Treatment of guinea pigs with either para-thion (1 – 10 mg/kg, sc) or diazinon (0. 75 – 75 mg/kg, sc) shifted pilo-carpine dose-response curves significantly to the right, indicatin...|$|R

The bifid ribs {{were in the}} right fourth rib of all 3 male cadavers. The upper intercostal spaces of the fourth bifid rib were considerably narrowed, whereas the lower intercostal spaces were widened. Although {{the size and shape}} of the bifid space between the upper and lower divisions of the bifid rib were different, the intercostal muscles were present in the bifid space in all cases. The third anterior intercostal artery from the internal thoracic artery supplied the bifid space in all cases.
