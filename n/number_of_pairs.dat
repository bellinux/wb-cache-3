5|$|The main {{difference}} between eukaryotic and prokaryotic oxidative phosphorylation is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under {{a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. In E. coli, for example, oxidative phosphorylation can be driven by a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pairs</b> of reducing agents and oxidizing agents, which are listed below. The midpoint potential of a chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials.|$|E
5|$|At the {{greatest}} {{extent of the}} last glacial period around 18,000 years ago, southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats, and the Alpine chough was found as far as south as southern Italy, well outside its current range. Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently, only to disappear within {{the last couple of}} centuries. In the Polish Tatra Mountains, where a population had survived since the glacial period, it was not found as a breeding bird after the 19th century. In Bulgaria, the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pairs</b> in the remaining colonies were much smaller. The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased. Foraging habitat can also be lost to human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows. Populations of choughs are stable or increasing in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists, but are declining or have become locally extinct where intensive farming methods have been introduced, such as Brittany, England, south-west Portugal and mainland Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season generally begins in August and September {{with the onset}} of the humid season, but the climate during a particular year may change the timing of breeding. On Cima, W. R. P. Bourne observed females remaining in flocks while males began to take up locations on rocky slopes from which they could sing. The {{breeding season}} is typically long enough that some pairs may be fledging young before others even start to build a nest; the greatest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pairs</b> breed when rains come, in October to November. Unmated males attract females by calling out beside a prospective nest site. When approached by a female, the displaying male will increase the intensity of his calls and hop around her while crouching with chestnut rump- and shoulder-feathers exposed. The male begins building the nest, but once a pair is formed both birds of the pair participate in the nest's construction and remain close together. Copulation occurs after the nest has been constructed, while the female is dominant in the pair for a time. The male invites the female to copulate by giving the crouching courtship display, and after ignoring and pecking at him initially, the female solicits copulation by crouching herself. When four vagrants were in the Netherlands in May 2013, a male was seen mounting a second male, apparently after the second crouched submissively to resolve a fight between them. This is the only recorded case of homosexual behaviour in sparrows.|$|E

25|$|The hidden {{variables}} theory fails, however, when {{we consider}} measurements of the spin of entangled particles along different axes (for example, along any of three axes that make angles of 120 degrees). If a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pairs</b> of such measurements are made (on a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pairs</b> of entangled particles), then statistically, if the local realist or hidden variables view were correct, the results would always satisfy Bell's inequality. A number of experiments have shown in practice that Bell's inequality is not satisfied. However, all experiments have loophole problems. When measurements of the entangled particles are made in moving relativistic reference frames, in which each measurement (in its own relativistic time frame) occurs before the other, the measurement results remain correlated.|$|E

40|$|Cross {{sectional}} {{studies suggest}} a link may exist between tooth emergence and obesity. To explore this relationship, we aimed {{to evaluate the}} prospective associations between primary tooth emergence and anthropometric measures in young adults. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyse relationships between primary tooth emergence, and anthropometric measures measured at 17. 8 years, in 2977 participants (1362 males and 1615 females) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). In minimally adjusted models, 'quintiles <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>paired</b> teeth' (assessed by questionnaire at 15 months) was positively associated with height [change in height (cm) per quintile increase in 'number <b>of</b> <b>paired</b> teeth' (β)  = 0. 35 (95 %CI: 0. 18, 0. 52) P = 0. 0001] and weight [ratio of geometric mean weight per quintile increase in 'number <b>of</b> <b>paired</b> teeth' (RGM)  = 1. 015 (95 %CI: 1. 010, 1. 019) P< 0. 0001]. The relationship with weight was largely driven by fat mass, which showed an equivalent relationship with 'quintiles <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>paired</b> teeth' to that seen for weight [RGM = 1. 036 (95 %CI: 1. 022, 1. 051) P< 0. 0001] (adjusted for height) ]. Conversely, no association was seen between 'quintiles <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>paired</b> teeth' and lean mass. An increase in 'quintiles <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>paired</b> teeth' at age 15 months {{was associated with a}} higher Tanner stage at age 13 in girls but not boys, but further adjustment of associations between 'quintiles <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>paired</b> teeth' and anthropometric traits for Tanner stage was without effect. Primary tooth emergence is associated with subsequent fat mass, suggesting these could share common constitutive factors, and that early primary tooth emergence may represent a hitherto unrecognised risk factor for the development of obesity in later life...|$|R
25|$|The clade Epimorpha, {{consisting}} of the orders Geophilomorpha and Scolopendromorpha, exhibits epimorphy: all pairs of legs are developed in the embryonic stages, and offspring do not develop more legs between moults. This clade contains the longest centipedes; {{the maximum number of}} thoracic segments may also vary intraspecifically, often on a geographical basis; in most cases, females bear more legs than males. The number of leg-bearing segments varies widely, from 15 to 191, but the developmental mode of their creation means they are always added in pairs—hence the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pairs</b> is always odd.|$|E

25|$|For graphs {{drawn in}} the plane without crossings, Fáry's theorem states that one gets the same class of planar graphs {{regardless}} of whether the edges of the graph are drawn as straight line segments or as arbitrary curves. But this equivalence does not hold true for other types of drawing. For instance, although the crossing number of a graph (the minimum number of crossings in a drawing with arbitrarily curved edges) may be determined in NP, it is complete for the existential theory of the reals to determine whether there exists a drawing achieving a given bound on the rectilinear crossing number (the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pairs</b> of edges that cross in any drawing with edges drawn as straight line segments {{in the plane}}).|$|E
25|$|A graph {{property}} {{is the question}} of whether a graph belongs to a given family of graphs; the answer must remain invariant under any relabeling of the vertices. In this context, the question to be determined is how many pairs of vertices must be tested for adjacency, in the worst case, before the property of interest can be determined to be true or false for a given implicit graph. Rivest and Vuillemin proved that any deterministic algorithm for any nontrivial graph property must test a quadratic <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pairs</b> of vertices. The full Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture is that any deterministic algorithm for a monotonic graph property (one that remains true if more edges are added to a graph with the property) must in some cases test every possible pair of vertices. Several cases of the conjecture have been proven to be true—for instance, it is known to be true for graphs with a prime number of vertices—but the full conjecture remains open. Variants of the problem for randomized algorithms and quantum algorithms have also been studied.|$|E
