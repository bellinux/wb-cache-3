5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of shrimps, salmon, halibut and cod. The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers, the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons of shrimp, around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. Hunting {{is also important to}} some of the local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, beluga whale, <b>narwhale,</b> reindeer and muskoxen.|$|E
60|$|The <b>Narwhale</b> {{has a very}} picturesque, leopard-like look, {{being of}} a milk-white ground color, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His oil is very superior, clear and fine; {{but there is little}} of it, and he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the {{circumpolar}} seas.|$|E
60|$|In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the <b>narwhale.</b> How {{could one}} look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king {{of the sea and}} a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.|$|E
25|$|Minke whales, {{humpback}} whale, and beluga {{whales are}} commonly seen around the island, and less commonly orcas and <b>narwhales,</b> with the archipelago being {{located on the}} northern edge of their summer range. Fin whales were newly confirmed to migrate into the waters.|$|R
50|$|Daniel and Gracie soon {{meet the}} Birdman in person, {{discover}} {{that he is}} kind, gentle and profoundly deaf. They begin a secret friendship. Born as Mr Woodcock on another nearby island named Samson, he tells the children {{that when he was}} a small boy, a group of <b>NarWhales</b> were beached and slaughtered by the islanders for their valuable horns. The <b>NarWhales</b> cursed them and the boat shipping the islanders and horns to the mainland was sunk, the Birdman's father among them. Next illness and death struck the island, then the plants began to fail, chickens stopped laying and the islanders left all except the Birdman and his mother. Mrs Woodcock had sworn she would not leave her husband's ghost alone, but when the Well runs dry, she is forced to leave. Before they do, the curse claims the Birdman's hearing, making him deaf.|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of the local Greenlandic Inuit, Whitney was able to hunt walrus, <b>narwhales,</b> polar bear, and other game. In the spring, the native people brought him to Ellesmere Island to hunt musk ox. Whitney {{attempted}} to keep a musk ox calf alive to bring back to the Philadelphia Zoo, but the calf did not survive.|$|R
6000|$|BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER III. (<b>Narwhale),</b> that is, Nostril whale.-- Another {{instance}} of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally {{mistaken for a}} peaked nose. The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, {{it would be hard}} to say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the <b>Narwhale</b> employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the <b>Narwhale,</b> rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets. The <b>Narwhale</b> I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; [...] "when Sir Martin returned from that voyage," [...] saith Black Letter, [...] "on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the <b>Narwhale,</b> which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor." [...] An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.|$|E
6000|$|Nor are {{the most}} {{conscientious}} compilations of Natural History {{for the benefit of}} the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of mistake. Look at that popular work [...] "Goldsmith's Animated Nature." [...] In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged [...] "whale" [...] and a [...] "narwhale." [...] I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the <b>narwhale,</b> one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have had}} enough of motion, [...] Weariness and wild alarm, [...] Tossing on the tossing ocean, [...] Where the tuskèd seahorse walloweth [...] In a stripe of grassgreen calm, [...] At noon-tide beneath the lea; [...] And the monstrous <b>narwhale</b> swalloweth [...] His foamfountains in the sea. [...] Long enough the winedark wave our weary bark did carry. [...] This is lovelier and sweeter, [...] Men of Ithaca, this is meeter, [...] In the hollow rosy vale to tarry, [...] Like a dreamy Lotos-eater, a delirious Lotos-eater! [...] We will eat the Lotos, sweet [...] As the yellow honeycomb, [...] In the valley some, and some [...] On the ancient heights divine; [...] And no more roam, [...] On the loud hoar foam, [...] To the melancholy home [...] At the limit of the brine, [...] The little isle of Ithaca, beneath the day's decline. [...] We'll lift no more the {{shattered}} oar, [...] No more unfurl the straining sail; [...] With the blissful Lotos-eaters pale [...] We will abide in the golden vale [...] Of the Lotos-land, till the Lotos fail; [...] We will not wander more. [...] Hark! how sweet the horned ewes bleat [...] On the solitary steeps, [...] And the merry lizard leaps, [...] And the foam-white waters pour; [...] And the dark pine weeps, [...] And the lithe vine creeps, [...] And the heavy melon sleeps [...] On {{the level of the}} shore: [...] Oh! islanders of Ithaca, we will not wander more, [...] Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore [...] Than labour in the ocean, and rowing with the oar, [...] Oh! islanders of Ithaca, we will return no more.|$|E
50|$|Daniel's {{oldest brother}} and some local boys {{set fire to}} the Birdman's cottage because they think he is {{signalling}} to the enemy- he is actually stopping ships from getting beached on the dangerous rocks or getting caught by the curse. They see the <b>Narwhales</b> {{and go back to the}} village. Soon the entire island comes to slaughter the whales but Daniel insists that they listen to the Birdman. Mr Woodcock finally tells them the true story of Samson and the islanders work together to get the whales back into the sea and away from the island.|$|R
2500|$|The third {{book was}} the one Melville {{reviewed}} for the Literary World in 1847, J. Ross Browne's Etchings of a Whaling Cruise (1846), which may have given Melville the first thought for a whaling book, {{and in any case}} contains passages embarrassingly similar to passages in Moby-Dick. The fourth book, Reverend Henry T. Cheever's The Whale and His Captors (1850), was used for two episodes in Moby-Dick but probably appeared too late in the writing of the novel to be of much more use. Melville did plunder a fifth book, William Scoresby, Jr., An Account of the Arctic Regions with a History and Description of the Northern Whale Fishery (1820), although the book became the standard whaling reference soon after publication, Melville satirized and parodied it on several occasions—for instance in the description of <b>narwhales</b> in the chapter [...] "Cetology", where he called Scoresby [...] "Charley Coffin" [...] and gave his account [...] "a humorous twist of fact": [...] "Scoresby will help out Melville several times, and on each occasion Melville will satirize him under a pseudonym." ...|$|R
60|$|The natural {{aptitude}} of the French for {{seizing the}} picturesqueness of things {{seems to be}} peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England's experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching {{the profile of a}} pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate miniatures of <b>narwhales</b> and porpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.|$|R

6000|$|Concerning all this, {{it is much}} to be deplored {{that the}} mast-heads of a {{southern}} whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits, called crow's-nests, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled [...] "A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;" [...] in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crow's-nest of the Glacier, which {{was the name of}} Captain Sleet's good craft. He called it the Sleet's crow's-nest, in honor of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable sidescreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray <b>narwhales,</b> or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow's-nest, with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the [...] "local attraction" [...] of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship's planks, and in the Glacier's case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned [...] "binnacle deviations," [...] "azimuth compass observations," [...] and [...] "approximate errors," [...] he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow's nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest within three or four perches of the pole.|$|R
5000|$|The narwhal, or <b>narwhale</b> (Monodon monoceros), is a {{medium-sized}} toothed whale that possesses a large [...] "tusk" [...] from a protruding canine tooth. It lives year-round in the Arctic waters around Greenland, Canada, and Russia. It {{is one of}} two living species of whale in the Monodontidae family, along with the beluga whale. The narwhal males are distinguished by a long, straight, helical tusk, which is an elongated upper left canine. The narwhal was one of many species described by Carl Linnaeus in his publication Systema Naturae in 1758.|$|E

Getting lost in a thick fog they accidentally land on Samson, discovering the dry well, the graves of the old islanders {{and one of the}} <b>Narwhale</b> horns.

40|$|Samples {{collected}} from mid-Ibexian (mid-Tremadoc) to late Whiterockian (Llandeilo) of East and eastern North Greenland have yielded {{a total of}} 9, 725 identifiable conodont clements. The conodonts are referred to 54 multi-element genera and 115 species, new taxa include three genera (Macheticodus, Wandelia and Wcbcrina) and nine species (Eucharodus apion, Macheticodus lekiskus, Multioistodus? celox, Pteracontiodus armillatus, Scalpellodus? narvhalensis, Sibiriodus? kalalekus, Wandelia fuscina, Weberina candidisphaera and Weberina guyi). The faunas are coniform-dominated and generally similar to shallow water, Midcontinent Province faunas found in North America. Some degree of endemicity is indicated {{by the presence of}} species found only in the eastern Canadian Arctic Islands and Greenland. The conodonts are referred to ten biozones, of which three zones in the Ibexian are newly named (the Loxodus bransoni, Glyptoconus quadraplicatus and Oepikodus communis Zones) as are three Ibexian sub-zones (the Acodus deltatus,?Reutterodus andinus and Protoprioniodus aranda). These are all based on the previous, informal faunal divisions established in North America. In East Greenland, the oldest faunas recovered, {{from the base of the}} Cape Weber Formation on Ella Ø, are referred to the L. bransoni Zone (mid-Ibexian). Both upper and lower boundaries are, however, diachronous and on Albert Heim Bjerge, 150 km to the north, the base of the formation contains conodonts of the younger G. quadraplicatus Zone. On Ella Ø, the lbexian-Whiterockian boundary occurs within the lower part of the <b>Narwhale</b> Sound Formation and the youngest conodonts recovered are referable to the Histiodella altifrons Zone (early Whiterockian). The youngest Ordovician conodonts recovered from East Greenland are from the Heim Bjerge Formation, directly underlying Devonian conglomerates, on C. H. Ostenfeld Nunatak; these faunas contain taxa of the Polyplacognathus sweeti Zone (late Whiterockian). In eastern North Greenland, the Wandel Valley Formation unconformably overlies Cambrian carbonates, and conodonts recovered from the base probably belong to the O. communis Zone (late lbexian). The Ibexian-Whiterockian boundary lies at or just above the lower boundary of the Upper Member and the top of the formation contains taxa referable to the Polyplacognathus friendsvillensis Zone (late Whiterockian). Contouring of the colour alteration indices (CAl) in North Greenland indicates that the isotherms are parallel to the margin of the Hazen Trough; to the east, in Kronprins Christian Land, they swing around to become parallel to the Caledonian front. Fused clusters recovered from the Cape Weber and Heim Bjerge Formations are amongst the oldest euconodont assemblages recorded. They are principally of coniform species and suggest a grasping function analogous to that of chaetognath spines...|$|E
