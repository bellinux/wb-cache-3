30|$|Covering {{approximation}} {{spaces are}} a generalization of equivalence-based rough set theories. In this paper, {{we will consider}} twelve types of covering based approximation operators by combining four types of covering lower approximation operators and three types of covering upper approximation operators. Then, we will study the properties of these <b>new</b> <b>pairs</b> and show they have most of the common properties among existing covering approximation pairs. Finally, the relation between these <b>new</b> <b>pairs</b> is studied.|$|R

5|$|Prior to the game's release, Warner Bros. Interactive and DC Entertainment {{launched}} a 10-week-long online marketing campaign called the Injustice Battle Arena. The web series, hosted by Taryn Southern, featured weekly match-ups between the playable {{cast in a}} tournament-style format. Each week, the arena was updated with different versus scenarios. Fans could vote for their favorite characters, and a video, depicting the winner of each round, would be released following each voting period. Videos detailing the skills and strengths of the combatants, including vox pop and celebrity interviews, were released alongside each <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> of challengers. Voters could redeem free rewards, ranging from Xbox Live avatar accessories to a downloadable character skin based on Green Arrow's appearance in the television series Arrow. Participating fans based in the United States were also eligible to win weekly prizes.|$|E
5|$|After Game2 {{ended on}} October 3, the Yankees and Cardinals boarded trains to St. Louis, Missouri. The mayor of St. Louis, Victor J. Miller, ordered that the workday end by three the next {{afternoon}} so that the city could welcome the Cardinals at Union Station. The Cardinals players were treated like champions by fans and citizens alike. Just outside the station, Mayor Miller stood at a podium and presented club manager and player Rogers Hornsby with a brand new Lincoln sedan priced at US$4,000 and {{paid for by the}} city's top businessmen. Each member of the Cardinals' team received a new hat, a <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> of shoes, and an engraved white-gold watch valued at a manufacturer's price of $100. As the Cardinals were receiving special treatment from the people of St. Louis, fans were lining up outside Sportsman's Park with the hope of being able to purchase tickets to Game3 for a price of $3.30.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before it}} {{opened to the}} public, the C gave notice of its {{intention}} to submit another private bill to Parliament, to construct a new line from its northern terminus at King William Street towards Islington. Because of the awkward arrangement of King William Street station, the extension {{was not to be}} connected directly to the existing running tunnels but was to be linked via a pedestrian subway through which passengers could make interchanges between the separate lines. The bill was rejected {{on the grounds that the}} extension failed to make a connection to the existing line. In November 1891, the C published details of a revised bill for the extension to Islington. The company had recognised the deficiencies of its King William Street station and, just a year after the line had opened, planned to construct a <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> of tunnels to bypass the problematic northern section.|$|E
40|$|A <b>new</b> {{thermocouple}} <b>pairing</b> {{was formed}} by combining thermocouple elements from two existing commercially available thermocouples {{to form a new}} combination (Ir- 40 Rh/Pt- 40 Rh) thermocouple. The output of this <b>new</b> <b>pairing</b> is nearly linear with temperature, and approximately equal to the output of one of the originating pairs (Ir- 40 Rh/Ir), and more than double that of the other pair (Pt- 40 Rh/Pt- 20 Rh).

5|$|Swiatek and Breen {{described}} the Alabama half dollar as {{caught up in}} the presidential election of 1920, as a Republican administration might not be willing to put the Democrat Wilson on a coin, or might insist on the new incumbent appearing, something likely to dampen sales in Alabama, part of the Democratic Solid South. The Republican, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, won the election and was inaugurated in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen wrote to Baker, suggesting a <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> of honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's chief executive {{at the time of the}} 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first governor, William Bibb. Cartoonist Frank Spangler of the Montgomery Advertiser prepared sketches of the new design. At James Fraser's suggestion, the plaster models were created by his wife, Laura Gardin Fraser, who was a noted sculptor in her own right. She shipped her completed work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and gained members' approval; the models were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint for use in making coinage dies. Laura Fraser thus became the first woman to design a coin, not only of the U.S., but of any country.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} is nocturnal {{over most of}} its range, but in Britain and some Pacific islands, it also hunts by day. Barn owls specialise in hunting animals {{on the ground and}} nearly all of their food {{consists}} of small mammals which they locate by sound, their hearing being very acute. They mate for life unless one of the pair gets killed, when a <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> bond may be formed. Breeding takes place at varying times of year according to locality, with a clutch, averaging about four eggs, being laid in a nest in a hollow tree, old building or fissure in a cliff. The female does all the incubation, and she and the young chicks are reliant on the male for food. When large numbers of small prey are readily available, barn owl populations can expand rapidly, and globally the bird is considered to be of least conservation concern. Some subspecies with restricted ranges are more threatened.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrophysiological}} {{correlates of}} recognition memory for new associations were investigated in two experiments. In both experiments subjects first studied unrelated word pairs. At test, they {{were presented with}} old words in the same pairing as at study (same pairs), old words in a different pairing from study (rearranged pairs), and <b>pairs</b> of <b>new</b> words. In Experiment 1 the test requirement was to discriminate between old and <b>new</b> <b>pairs</b> and, for any pair judged old, to then judge whether the pair was the same or rearranged. In Experiment 2 the requirement was merely to discriminate between old and <b>new</b> <b>pairs.</b> Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded for correctly classified same, rearranged and <b>new</b> <b>pairs.</b> The ERPs elicited by same pairs exhibited a similar pattern of effects in both experiments. Relative to the ERPs to <b>new</b> <b>pairs,</b> these effects {{took the form of}} sustained positive shifts with two distinct scalp maxima, over the left temporo–parietal and right frontal scalp respectively. ERPs to rearranged pairs showed effects which were similar in scalp topography, but markedly smaller in magnitude. This pattern of ERP effects closely resembles that found previously for test items defined as recollected {{on the basis of their}} attracting a successful source judgement. The findings therefore suggest that associative recognition memory shares some of the recollective processes that are engaged by the requirement to retrieve contextual information about a study episode. The findings from Experiment 2 indicate that the processes associated with the recollection of associated pairs are engaged regardless of whether the retrieval of associative information is an explicit task requireme...|$|R

50|$|On Day 6, it was {{revealed}} that the Australian public had chosen Dion & Jason to be the next Heads of House. On Day 8, Dion and Jason made their first Power Play as the Heads of House. They had to swap a member of one pair with a member from another, thereby creating two <b>new</b> <b>pairs.</b> They chose to switch Cat and Sam and Travis and Ryan. This meant that the <b>new</b> <b>pairs</b> formed were Cat and Travis, and Sam and Ryan. On Day 10, Dion & Jason received the Nominations Power Play.

40|$|Pairs of {{explicit}} Runge-Kutta methods of dierent orders of accuracy form ecient algorithms for treating non-sti ordinary dierential equations. While parametric families of dierent types and orders are known, {{the characterization of}} pairs of orders p 1 and p; p 6, remains incomplete, {{and the search for}} better pairs continues. A scheme to distinguish between pairs of dierent types has been developed after studying a variety of known methods and pairs. The resulting classication scheme in-cludes almost all known pairs in a natural way, and provides designs which lead to <b>new</b> <b>pairs</b> of several types. To derive a <b>new</b> family of <b>pairs,</b> a promising design is selected from the classication, and the corresponding order equations are solved by adapting or generalizing simplifying conditions that previously facilitated the construction of pairs of a more restricted design.

25|$|Under {{moderate}} usage, {{a pair of}} pointe shoes will typically last through ten {{to twenty}} hours of wear. For dance students, this often translates into weeks or months of serviceable use {{from a pair of}} pointe shoes. Professional dancers typically wear out pointe shoes much more quickly; a <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> may wear out in a single performance. As a result, most professional ballet companies provide shoe allowances for their dancers to defray the cost of frequent shoe replacement.|$|E
