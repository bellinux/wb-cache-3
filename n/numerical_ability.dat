2500|$|On {{behalf of}} the bank and its clients, a large {{investment}} bank's primary function is [...] buying and selling products. In market making, traders will buy and sell financial products {{with the goal of}} making money on each trade. Sales is the term for the investment bank's sales force, whose primary job is to call on institutional and high-net-worth investors to suggest trading ideas (on a caveat emptor basis) and take orders. Sales desks then communicate their clients' orders to the appropriate trading rooms, which can price and execute trades, or structure new products that fit a specific need. Structuring has been a relatively recent activity as derivatives have come into play, with highly technical and numerate employees working on creating complex structured products which typically offer much greater margins and returns than underlying cash securities. In 2010, investment banks came under pressure as a result of selling complex derivatives contracts to local municipalities in Europe and the US. Strategists advise external as well as internal clients on the strategies that can be adopted in various markets. Ranging from derivatives to specific industries, strategists place companies and industries in a quantitative framework with full consideration of the macroeconomic scene. This strategy often affects the way the firm will operate in the market, the direction it would like to take in terms of its proprietary and flow positions, the suggestions salespersons give to clients, as well as the way structurers create new products. Banks also undertake risk through proprietary trading, performed by a special set of traders who do not interface with clients and through [...] "principal risk"—risk undertaken by a trader after he buys or sells a product to a client and does not hedge his total exposure. Banks seek to maximize profitability for a given amount of risk on their balance sheet. The necessity for <b>numerical</b> <b>ability</b> in sales and trading has created jobs for physics, computer science, mathematics and engineering Ph.D.s who act as quantitative analysts.|$|E

40|$|Young children’s home {{environment}} importantly contributes to their early <b>numerical</b> <b>abilities</b> development. Up to now, empirical {{evidence on the}} relation between children’s {{home environment}} and their spontaneous focusing on numerosity (SFON) and on {{the relation between the}} former and early numerical development in general in developing countries is non-existent. We investigated the contribution of entering kindergartners’ home environment, i. e., SES, to their early <b>numerical</b> <b>abilities</b> and SFON in a developing country (Ecuador), controlling for children’s intelligence, working memory, and age. At kindergarten entry, 355 5 -year-olds solved a test battery addressing their early <b>numerical</b> <b>abilities</b> (Ecuadorian Test of Early Number and Arithmetic [Bojorque et al., 2015] and the Tools for Early Assessment in Math [Clements & Sarama, 2011]), SFON (Elsi Bird Imitation task [Hannula & Lehtinen, 2005]), intelligence, and working memory. In line with previous findings, we observed large inter-individual differences in Ecuadorian children’s early <b>numerical</b> <b>abilities</b> and SFON at kindergarten entry.

The present paper provides a first attempt to investigate behavioral and neural trajectories of <b>numerical</b> <b>abilities</b> longitudinally in typically developing (TD) and DD children. During a study period of 4 years, 28 children (8 – 11 years) were evaluated twice by means of neuropsychological tests and a numerical order fMRI paradigm.

In contrast, DD children revealed persistent deficits in number processing and arithmetic. Brain imaging results of the DD group showed an age-related activation increase in parietal regions (intraparietal sulcus), pointing to a delayed development of number processing areas. Besides, an activation increase in frontal areas was observed over time, indicating the use of compensatory mechanisms. In conclusion, results suggest a continuation in neural development of number representation in DD, whereas the neural network for simple ordinal number estimation seems to be stable or show only subtle changes in TD children over time...|$|R

By contrast, basic-level numerical skills like magnitude judgments have not yet been tested in these children. Aims: The aim of the present research was to investigate whether preterm birth also affects these basic <b>numerical</b> <b>abilities,</b> with particular attention to the transition from preschool to formal education. Method: One hundred-forty very preterm children and 60 age-matched controls were recruited in a cross-sectional study at 6 and 8 years of age. Magnitude comparison tasks with non-symbolic dot displays or symbolic Arabic-number stimuli, measuring accuracy and reaction time, were administered to participants. We also investigated explicit number knowledge, as well as general cognitive developmental levels, to gain a broader picture of preterm abilities. Results: Despite no general cognitive delay, the more simple approximate non-symbolic representation of numerical magnitude was affected by preterm birth, with slower reaction times at both ages compared to controls. Additionally, clear {{difficulties in}} the construction of the symbolic representation of numerical magnitude and in explicit number knowledge emerged in the 6 -year-old preterm children, with a recovery from this serious delay finally by 8 years. Conclusions: The serious delays identified here in basic <b>numerical</b> <b>abilities</b> in preterm children, despite normal IQ, point to the need for further studies in order to elucidate the relationship between basic <b>numerical</b> <b>abilities</b> and subsequent difficulties in formal mathematic achievement at school...|$|R
