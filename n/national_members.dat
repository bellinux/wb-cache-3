500|$|In 1995, netball {{became a}} {{permanent}} Olympic recognised sport after a twenty-year period of lobbying and a two-year probation period. This makes it eligible {{to be played}} in future Games.

500|$|Because of the 1983 rejection, {{an earlier}} idea {{that had been}} tried and failed in 1979 was revisited: Creating {{regional}} Federations for the Americas, Europe, Oceania and Asia, regional groupings mirroring that of the Olympic organisers. [...] This was implemented by 1987, which was rejected later that year because the sport did not meet all the criteria established {{and it was not}} yet a global sport. [...] The IOC viewed the sport as one belonging only to the Commonwealth of Nations. While the netball was rejected for a third time, the New Zealand hosts of the 1990 Commonwealth Games managed to get the sport to have demonstration status, with the news of this being announced in 1987. [...] That same year, netball also gained full member status from the General Assembly of International Sports Federations In the mean time, the IOC did provide the Federation with a [...] grant, though none of this grant money was used by 1991. [...] Because of {{what appeared to be the}} unlikely recognition by the IOC, the Federation urged its <b>national</b> <b>members</b> to seek membership with their national Olympic committees so national federations could access national funding in order to help grow the sport inside their home countries.|$|E
