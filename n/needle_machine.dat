50|$|Different {{manufacturers}} have produced machines {{with one of}} three types of presser foot shank in mind. These are the low shank, high shank, and the slant shank presser foot. A low shank presser foot has a 0.5 in distance {{from the bottom of}} the foot to the center of the thumbscrew; a high shank foot has a 1 in distance; a slant shank foot is distinctly slanted. The kind of foot a given machine requires is not interchangeable: a low-shank machine will only accept a low shank presser foot, and a high shank machine only a high-shank presser foot, though within these categories any low shank or high shank foot will fit any corresponding low shank or high shank machine; exceptionally, a slant shank foot can only be used with a Singer slant <b>needle</b> <b>machine</b> and no other (likewise, such a machine can accept no other kind of foot).|$|E

Development of these industries peaked during World War I, which saw a great increase in demand for Chinese goods, which benefitted China's industries.

50|$|A needle feed, {{used only}} in {{industrial}} machines, moves the material while the needle {{is in the}} material. In fact, the needle may be the primary feeding force. Some implementations of needle feed rock the axis of needle motion back and forth, while other implementations keep the axis vertical while moving it forward and back. In both cases, there is no feed action while the needle {{is out of the}} material. Needle feed is often used in conjunction with a modified drop feed, and is very common on industrial two <b>needle</b> <b>machines.</b> Household machines do not use needle feed as a general rule.|$|R

5000|$|More {{than a dozen}} modern {{conventions}} {{exist for}} numbering the sizes of sewing <b>machine</b> <b>needles,</b> though only two remain in common use: the American (established and propagated by Singer) and the European (also called the [...] "number metric" [...] or [...] "NM"). The European designation, established in 1942, is considered the uniform fixed size and corresponds to {{the diameter of the}} needle in hundredths of a millimeter at a non-reinforced point above the scarf. The following chart gives a comparison of the two systems. In both cases, a larger number corresponds to a larger, heavier <b>needle.</b> Most sewing <b>machine</b> <b>needles</b> will have packaging that gives both numbers in its size descriptionâ€” that is, the size numbers 100 and 16 always occur together (as either 100/16 or 16/100).

40|$|Changing wastes into raw {{materials}} {{is one of}} the most favoured options for waste management, as it diverts wastes from landfill and saves resources. Fibres, either vegetable (cellulosic) or synthetic, may be added to cement pastes in order improve the properties of concrete or mortar by reinforcement. At the same time, if our source of fibres is wastes, then such processes make ways for recycling. In this work we studied the compatibility of residues from the nonwoven textile industry with Portland cement, with the aim of manufacturing fibre-cement composites. The temperature of cement setting was monitored and when fibre or other materials were added to cement pastes. The textile waste from <b>needling</b> <b>machines</b> investigated here is not compatible with cement. The reason is ascribed to a higher cotton content (65 %), which enables cation exchange to occur in cement suspensions, and that disturbs cement setting reactions. On the other hand, however, synthetic fibres do not seem to hinder cement setting...|$|R
40|$|Earth {{construction}} is worldwide spread. It {{is a valuable}} heritage to preserve because of its cultural and socio-economical relevance. Furthermore, earth construction, since it needs significantly less energy than modern construction techniques, and works with local materials, it contributes for thesustainable development. In Portugal, there is an impressive earth construction heritage that requires maintenance. Among the Portuguese traditional building techniques related to earth construction, the rammed earth, the adobe and the tabique are the most relevant ones. This work is focused on attempting to apply textile waste micro-fiber as an alternative sustainable reinforcement solution of earthy render of tabique walls. Therefore, several earthy render samples reinforced with 1 % textile waste micro-fiber content were prepared and mechanically tested. The main experimental results are presented and discussed, and the main conclusions are drawn. This study also contributes for recycling a specific waste, namely short fibers from <b>needling</b> <b>machines</b> used to produce nonwoven fabrics...|$|R

40|$|Sound {{pollution}} {{has become}} an important issue that has been addressed by scientists of various disciplines. Control of sound in areas of transport and building industries is of paramount importance. Textiles are widely used as sound insulators. Among the broad spectrum of textiles, nonwoven fabrics due to their technical merits and wide acceptance are extensively used as sound controlling media. In this work, various blends of polypropylene and naturally grown hollow Estabragh fibers were used to prepare sound absorptive nonwoven layers. The fiber blends were fed to a laboratory scale carding machine. Carded webs were lightly needled on a laboratory scale <b>needling</b> <b>machine.</b> Acoustic properties of needled samples were evaluated using the Impedance tube method. The Taguchi method was {{used to analyze the}} effective parameters influencing fabric acoustic properties. Results show that the proportion of Estabragh fibers in the blends strongly affects the noise absorption coefficient (NAC). Frequency is the second effective factor and is followed by nonwoven layer mass (areal density) and punch density, respectively. It was concluded that layers comprised of 100 % Estabragh fibers achieved the highest value of NAC. The results also pointed to existence of a direct correlation between noise absorption coefficient and the amount of punch density exerted during needling process. It was found that the increase in the amount punch density resulted in higher values of NAC...|$|R
