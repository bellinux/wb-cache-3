40|$|The paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> in force in the 25 countries of the European Union, examines {{the reasons for the}} growing appetite for such rules, and assesses whether they have an influence on budgetary developments. The analysis is based on a new dataset constructed from questionnaires submitted to experts in finance ministries of EU countries which report a large amount of information on the <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> in force in the EU countries over the 1990 - 2005 period. The paper shows that the number of fiscal rules in force in the EU countries has increased in the past decades. The introduction of the Maastricht Treaty and of the SGP seem to have been catalysts for the introduction of fiscal rules. The analysis, based on the estimation of augmented fiscal reaction functions, confirms the existence of a relation between <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> and budgetary developments. The results show that some dimensions matter particularly for the capacity of fiscal rules to influence fiscal policy. Notably, the share of government finances covered by rules and the presence of strong enforcement mechanisms seem to be particularly relevant. The analysis also shows that there is a link between the design of <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> and the stabilisation function of fiscal policy. These findings confirm that while <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> can be useful devices to ensure better policies, careful attention should be devoted to the way they are designed. ...|$|E
40|$|Institutional issues now loom {{large in}} the theory and {{practice}} of macroeconomic policymaking. South Africa has recently adopted two institutional innovations in monetary policy, namely inflation targeting and constitutional protection of the independence of the central bank. The South Africa fiscal authorities have implemented multi-year expenditure planning, but <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> {{do not seem to be}} on the agenda yet. However, the growing popularity of such rules in other countries suggests that they will eventually come under consideration in South Africa as well. The purpose of this article is to stimulate debat e on the potential of <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> at the national-government level in South Africa. In section 1, we introduce the rules-versus-discretion debate and summarise the practical shortcomings of discretionary regimes. Section 2 outlines options for reforms. In section 3, we draw on theory and case studies to compare the effectiveness of <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> and the accountability-enhancing fiscal reforms that are being implemented in South Africa. Against this background, we offer an answer to the question whether or not South Africa should adopt <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> in section 4. Our major conclusion is that the adoption of numerical rules is more likely to do harm than to improve fiscal policymaking in South Africa. Articl...|$|E

It argues that Albania''s public debt remains too high {{and needs to be}} reduced. Strengthening the fiscal framework, including by introducing a <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rule,</b> could help achieve this objective. The paper discusses two alternative rules, with the objective of achieving a gradual decline in the public debt ratio.

40|$|The {{strengthening}} of national fiscal frameworks, including <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules,</b> {{has recently been}} proposed as {{an important part of}} the economic governance reform package for the EU. The strength of <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> can be described along the dimensions of their statutory base, the room to revise budgetary objectives, provisions for their monitoring and enforcement, and their media visibility. With a unique data set summarizing the quality of national fiscal rules along these dimensions, we show that stronger fiscal rules in euro area member states reduce sovereign risk. According to our estimates, yield spreads against Germany of countries with relatively weak fiscal rules could be up to 100 basis points lower if they upgraded their <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules.</b> The legal base turns out to be the most important dimension for the perceived effectiveness of the rules. The effectiveness of the correction and enforcement mechanisms turns out to be very important as well, while the role of the bodies in charge of monitoring and enforcing compliance is somewhat smaller. Overall, national fiscal rules are found to be beneficial for market assessments of governments' ability and willingness to timely service debt: they could thus provide an effective way to implement fiscal discipline. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to on-going empirical {{search for an}} appropriate crude oil price benchmark that ensures greater financial stability and efficient fiscal management in Nigeria. It adopted the seasonally adjusted ARIMA forecasting models using monthly data series from 2000 m 01 to 2012 m 12 to predict future movement in Nigeria crude oil prices. The paper derived a more robust and dynamic framework that accommodates fluctuation in crude oil price and also in government spending. The result shows that if the incessant withdrawal from the ECA fund and the increasing debt profile of government in recent times are factored into the benchmark, the real crude oil <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rule</b> is (US$ 82. 3) for 2013 which {{is higher than the}} official benchmark of $ 75 used for 2013 and 2014 budget proposal. The paper argues that the current long run price rule based on 5 - 10 year moving average approach adopted by government is rigid and inflexible as a rule for managing Nigerian oil funds. The unrealistic assumption of the extant benchmark accounted for excessive depletion and lack of accountability of the excess crude oil account. The paper concludes that except the federal government can curtail its spending profligacy and adopts a more stringent <b>fiscal</b> discipline <b>rules,</b> the current benchmark is unrealistic and unsuitable for fiscal management of oil revenue in the context of Nigerian economic spending profile...|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the concepts}} of intergenerational equity and fiscal sustainability in South Africa. The question raised {{is whether or not}} South Africa can adopt stimulatory fiscal measures, with a simultaneous increase in debt, so as to improve long-term growth potential in a sustainable manner without creating an excessive burden on future generations. The debate surrounding the use of stimulatory fiscal policy has come to the fore once again as monetary policy has become a restricted and ineffective macroeconomic policy tool in certain countries after the world-wide financial crisis and the Euro-debt crisis. Fiscal sustainability risks and high debt levels remain a source of concern in the United States and the Euro-zone, while South Africa presently seems to be at no great risk. With South Africa’s intention to become a developmental state, the use and appropriateness of fiscal policy is considered. An overlapping-generations model is used {{to determine whether or not}} future generations will be burdened due to current stimulatory policy. The use of <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> in South Africa is discussed and considered in light of various political incentives and constraints. The conclusion given is that the possible use of a procedural <b>fiscal</b> <b>rule,</b> such as the ‘golden rule’, may add credibility to the current regime, while a <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rule</b> is seen as unnecessary given South Africa’s responsible use of fiscal policy thus far. As it stands, there is little possibility or risk that the public debt in South Africa will become too high in the near future. Although South Africa has been affected by the crisis, the developmental nature of the economy has been sustained through the use of responsible discretionary fiscal policy, putting South Africa in a positive position to meet its long-run growth potential...|$|R
40|$|In {{the theory}} of {{monetary}} and fiscal policy interaction, the assumption of Ricardian households isolates the determinants of fiscal policy instrument from the price stabilization policies {{carried out by the}} central bank. One of the main implications of the above mentioned Ricardian assumption is that the fiscal policy does not have any distortionary effect for the economy, i. e. it does not affect the behaviour of the households, supporting that way the fiscal policy’s neutrality. The argument for this view comes if one assumes that fiscal policy has a distortionary effect on the behaviour of the agents. We relax the above non distortionary assumption by assuming that the imposition of the taxes is consistent with a transaction cost of the tax system that underlies the state - tax payer interaction. In this way we develop a channel through which the stability of prices carried out by the independent central bank is, within optimality, also a function of the fiscal policy determinants (the transaction cost, the tax rates and the debt level). The analysis is carried out in a framework of a monetary union, with two different countries. Within this framework, the effectiveness of a <b>numerical</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>rule</b> is also examined.

However, the problem of <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> that have been applied in past is in ignoring the economic fundamentals that determine fiscal sustainability.

We assess whether fiscal rules impact budget balances and sovereign yields, and we perform a simulation exercise to compute debt developments of EU countries, assuming that they had implemented a numerical expenditure rule in 1990.

We find that fiscal rules contribute to the reduction of budget deficits, specifically expenditure rules, which significantly impact primary expenditure and conclude that countries with rules experienced lower sovereign bond yields.

Furthermore, independent monitoring and enforcement bodies (issuing real-time alerts) turn out to be significantly associated with a higher probability of compliance.
