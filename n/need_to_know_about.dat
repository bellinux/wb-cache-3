After the ducklings are born, Mr. Mallard decides to take a trip up the river to see what the rest of it is like. Mr. and Mrs. Mallard agree to meet at the Public Garden in one week.

The website features videos, photographs, and other information related to each week's contestants, as well as mini-sites promoting remote tapings and special tournaments.

500|$|Time {{magazine}} writer James Poniewozik {{said the}} episode continued {{the development of}} the town of Pawnee, which he said was like a character itself and compared it to The Simpsons Springfield. Poniewozik said [...] "Media Blitz" [...] also showed how well integrated Scott has become with the cast, and called the [...] "Crazy Ira and The Douche" [...] interview [...] "maybe the most perfect scene P has put together yet". Likewise, Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Ben's interview with Perd Hapley [...] "one of the best scenes Parks & Rec has ever done". Heisler enjoyed how the series gradually built up Ben Wyatt's backstory throughout the season, [...] "then took it way over-the-top". However, he expressed disappointment that the Ann and Chris subplot ended with no resolution. Zap2it writer Rick Porter, called the episode a [...] "great showcase for Scott's deadpan gifts" [...] and wrote, [...] "This show hasn't had a real miss yet this season." [...] Porter said the April and Andy subplot was less interesting, but he enjoyed the scenes between Ron and Andy. Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode for bringing Scott's character to the forefront, as well as for providing satire on small-town politics without coming across as preachy. Kandell said of the April and Andy story, [...] "If their kiss at the shoeshine stand, as expected and inevitable as it may have been, didn't make your heart soar just a little bit, then you're dead inside and probably just turned on NBC for Outsourced a few minutes early." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad complimented Scott, calling him a [...] "current-generation Bob Newhart" [...] and [...] "one of those actors who can just give someone a look and it conveys everything you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> what his character is thinking". Keller said he also enjoyed seeing April and Andy reconcile, but felt the Crazy Ira and The Douche scene was ineffective because, regarding morning zoo radio shows, [...] "it's hard to parody something that's already a parody of itself".|$|E
