40|$|The hunter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>gift</b> is {{a common}} motif in stories by {{indigenous}} writers from Taiwan. I interpret the hunter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>gift</b> as symbolic, both {{of a way of}} life in which gift exchange predominates and also of a mentality in which the fruits of the forest are regarded as gifts, not as raw materials to be extracted and sold. Yet the hunter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>gift</b> in Taiwanese indigenous stories is always in danger of being sold, so that a story about a hunter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>gift</b> can be read as a meditation on the indigenous encounter with capitalist modernity. The article begins by drawing on Marcel Mauss 2 ̆ 7 s monograph on the gift and Marx 2 ̆ 7 s writings on alienation to develop a model of social transformation from gift society to commodity society. I propose 2 ̆ 7 ecorealism 2 ̆ 7 as a genre of fiction in which an omniscient third person narrator places individual action not just in social but also in ecological context. Then I interpret three stories by Taiwan indigenous writers as works of ecorealism. These three stories, Auvini Kadresengan 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Home to Return to, 2 ̆ 2 Topas Tamapima 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 The Last Hunter, 2 ̆ 2 and Badai 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Ginger Road 2 ̆ 2 are, on first reading, nostalgic and tragic. I argue they are also critical of the impact of capitalism on community and ecology and hopeful that the gift economy might complement the commodity economy in interpersonal and ecological interchange. The indigenous hunter has been seen as a threat to wild animal populations, but the cultural tradition he represents might guide our responses to environmental problems, a possibility I consider in an afterword on the sustainability of the bushmeat trade...|$|R

40|$|Saul Bellow 2 ̆ 7 s novels, The Adventures of Augie March, Henderson the Rain King, Herzog, and Humboldt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gift,</b> {{have all}} been labeled picaresque and/or their protagonists called picaros by various critics. This study investigates the {{possible}} reasons for grouping such diverse novels within a category that is often inappropriate both for the form and the protagonist of each novel. The problem is approached from four different critical perspectives: historical, generic, modal and mythic. Historical critics generally conclude that the picaresque tradition {{should be limited to}} the 16 th century and to Spain. Generic criticism, while less rigid than historical criticism, demands certain formal requirements of the novels that are placed within the picaresque genre; Bellow 2 ̆ 7 s Herzog and Humboldt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gift</b> do not fullfill these requirements. Modal criticism is well suited to 20 th century works that combine multiple literary traditions. However, because the modal approach is so expansive, it more readily distinguishes novelistic similarities, than differences: it tends to homogenize novels into one unbounded category. Myth criticism and, in particular, the myth of the picaro most effectively provide a common denominator for Bellow 2 ̆ 7 s four novels. Rather than forcing the novels into formal, structural patterns, myth criticism distinguishes a psychological pattern that can be developed within a diversity of plot structures and novelistic subgenres. ^ Bellow refashions the traditional myth of the picaro to suit the demands of his 20 th century protagonists who find the world mysteriously, yet destructively, overwhelming. Bellow 2 ̆ 7 s creative myth acts as a substructure for his novels, patterning the picaros 2 ̆ 7 intellectual and emotional development. In trying to cope with urban chaos, the picaros confront their excessive emotions, their egocentricity, their intellectualizing, and, finally, their own deaths. This process, usually internalized, leads to a more balanced perception of their social responsibilities and their personal identities, culminating in a renewed appreciation of the mystery of existence and a recognition of the endless possibilities for manifesting inherent human nobility. It is, therefore, this mythic substructure that is responsible for critics ascribing Bellow 2 ̆ 7 s novels to the picaresque tradition. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{the task}} of this paper to {{demonstrate}} the thesis that a more holistic view of salvation {{can lead to a}} new understanding of the healing ministry of the Church. The ministry of healing is often fragmented due to sectarian loyalties, each practitioner concentrating almost exclusively on his own small terrain in the vast field of wholeness. In fact, the personality includes not only the physical body and the rational mind but also an insistent will to purpose that drives us on to our finest endeavour, that makes our lives ultimately meaningful in the face of disease and death that conclude all mortal existence. Salvation, as receiving back faith as God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>gift,</b> took many forms in the history of Jesus, especially in his healing activities. To interpret this point of view the theologies of Earth, Tillich and Schillebeeckx were brought in.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the challenge the city and city experience have posed to Bellow throughout his career. The dissertation begins by examining the works of Bellow 2 ̆ 7 s literary apprenticeship, Dangling Man and The Victim. It follows Bellow 2 ̆ 7 s first, self-conscious efforts to find his place as a city writer and intellectual {{in the tradition of}} modern urban fiction and to come to terms as a city man and Jew with the emerging cosmopolitan world of post-war America. The dissertation continues with an examination of Augie March and Seize the Day. It reveals Bellow forging his original voice as a city writer, while establishing the continuity of his development from a literary apprentice to a literary master. ^ The dissertation then turns to Henderson the Rain King, Bellow 2 ̆ 7 s only major work without a dominant city setting. Examining Henderson 2 ̆ 7 s quest, the dissertation confirms Bellow 2 ̆ 7 s observation that he cannot 2 ̆ 2 possibly separate my knowledge of life, such as it is, from the city 2 ̆ 2 and his judgement that from Henderson he 2 ̆ 2 dates being in fullest command of his powers. 2 ̆ 2 The dissertation then attends to the success that meets Bellow 2 ̆ 7 s efforts in Herzog and Sammler 2 ̆ 7 s Planet to adapt his mature style to the demands of his own native ground. Here, Bellow realizes what had been his ambition, but not his accomplishment as a young writer, when he took as the subject of his art the challenge of the city which informs all his later fiction. ^ The dissertation concludes with a brief consideration of Humboldt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gift.</b> A compendium of the many uses Bellow has made of the city in his long career, Humboldt 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Gift</b> offers a fitting coda to a study of his accomplishment as a city writer. In Bellow 2 ̆ 7 s thinly-veiled memoir of the progress of his generation of city Jews and city intellectuals from interlopers on the American scene to media celebrities and culture heroes, it finds a valediction for his generation 2 ̆ 7 s formative role in enacting and interpreting the public spectacles and private dramas of an America discovering itself as an irremediably urban world. ...|$|R

However, few researchers have focused {{specifically on the}} process of empowerment in Iranian people with diabetes. Understanding the empowerment process could help health professionals facilitate empowerment. Aim: To explore the empowerment process in Iranian people with diabetes. Method: A grounded theory research design was used incorporating in-depth interviews to collect the data from men and women aged 21 – 73 years (n = 16). Data were collected between February and July 2007. Constant comparative analysis was undertaken to identify key categories. Findings: Participants indicated being embarrassed by the diagnosis, thirsting to learn, living in the shadow of fear, accepting diabetes as reality, managing diabetes and feeling empowered were distinct but interconnected phases in the empowerment process. The empowerment process was influenced by cultural and religious beliefs including the concept of the doctor as holy man, accepting diabetes as God 2 ̆ 7 s will, caring for the body because it was God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>gift,</b> paying attention to symptomatic disease, and support from peers and family, especially daughters.

40|$|The Death of Contract {{collects}} Professor Gilmore 2 ̆ 7 s lectures {{given at}} Ohio State University Law School in 1970, with footnotes added to provide further explanation, qualification, and documentation. It {{is easy to}} tell that these were lectures, not because of their tone of urbane chattiness (Gilmore 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>gift</b> of style makes {{some of his most}} technical work sound like Talleyrand 2 ̆ 7 s table talk), but because of the looseness of their design and casualness of their execution.

But for all their informality these lectures are of extraordinary interest. They tell us how a great commercial lawyer (who is also a legal historian and contracts casebook editor) views what happened to the law of contract in the 20 th century. Though expounded with rare felicity and supported by an unusual breadth of historical learning, this perspective is, I believe, a common one among scholars of contract law.

NASA's accomplishments continue to amaze the world. With the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) Americans once again tasked NASA to carry out a project that is expected to provide inspiration and economic stimulus to the United States and to the world. In preparation NASA has thoroughly examined space program precedents. There is, however, another precedent which has not been examined in this context but whose scope and environment in many ways parallel the VSE. This project was initiated by a team that had, ten years before, successfully completed an effort that, at a cost of $ 151 billion (2008 values), had pushed the envelope of technology, brought economic growth, established their country as the world leader in engineering, and been broadly accepted as their country <b>s</b> <b>gift</b> to Mankind. The new project was again inspired by popular desire to enhance national prestige and make yet another major contribution to Humanity. The new effort was predicted to require eight years and $ 156 billion (2008 values).

The author traces the influence of those courses and books on her externship course and textbook, written with others. She cites the value of Bellow 2 ̆ 6 Moulton 2 ̆ 7 s pioneering employment of visual and kinesthetic learning modes and explicit statement to students about educational goals and methods. She identifies paradigms for lawyering tasks that have remained useful to her throughout her career.
