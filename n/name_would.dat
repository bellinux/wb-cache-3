5|$|Its most {{noticeable}} effect {{is due to}} its first unique feature: flavour changing. A neutron, for example, is heavier than a proton (its sister nucleon), but it cannot decay into a proton without changing the flavour (type) {{of one of its}} two down quarks to an up quark. Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing, so this proceeds by weak decay; without weak decay, quark properties such as strangeness and charm (associated with the quarks of the same <b>name)</b> <b>would</b> also be conserved across all interactions.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni {{impacted}} {{the island}} nations of Tuvalu and Fiji, while it also threatened the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. The {{majority of the}} Tuvaluan islands suffered minor damage from Joni, while in Fiji the system caused a moderate to severe amount of damage. Due {{to the impact of}} this system, the name Joni was subsequently retired, from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization. This would normally mean that the <b>name</b> <b>would</b> not be used again in the region, however, the name remained on the list and was used during the 2008–09 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{toothpaste}} tube manufacturer Betts {{opened a}} factory at No.505 Ipswich road in 1953. In 2008, the firm decided {{to close the}} factory and moved to smaller premises elsewhere in town. In 2014, Bellway Homes announced they would convert the former Ipswich Road factory into a housing estate named Avellana Place. Locals protested against the name, which is Spanish for hazelnut, saying a more appropriate <b>name</b> <b>would</b> be after the 1944 Lancaster Bomber crash.|$|E
5|$|Atlético Mineiro {{was formed}} on 25 March 1908 {{by a group}} of twenty-two {{students}} from Belo Horizonte, who decided the club's <b>name</b> <b>would</b> be Athletico Mineiro Foot Ball Club. The club's first match was played against Sport Club Futebol on 21 March 1909; Atlético won 3–0, with the first goal scored by Aníbal Machado. In 1913, the club's name was officially changed to Clube Atlético Mineiro, and in the following year Atlético won the Taça Bueno Brandão, the first competition ever held in the state of Minas Gerais. In 1915, the club won the inaugural edition of the Campeonato Mineiro, the state league of Minas Gerais. The competition was then organised by the Liga Mineira de Sports Athléticos, which would later become the Federação Mineira de Futebol.|$|E

5|$|During the 30th {{session of}} the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in November 1997, a {{proposal}} was put forward by Hong Kong to give Asian typhoons local names and to stop using the European and American names {{that had been used}} since 1945. The committee's Training and Research Coordination Group was subsequently tasked to consult with members and work out the details of the scheme in order to present a list of names for approval at the 31st session. During August 1998, the group met and decided that each member of the committee would be invited to contribute ten names to the list and that five principles would be followed for the selection of names. It was also agreed that each <b>name</b> <b>would</b> have to be approved by each member and that a single objection would be enough to veto a name. A list of 140 names was subsequently drawn up and submitted to the Typhoon Committee's 32nd session, who after a lengthy discussion approved the list and decided to implement it on January 1, 2000. It was also decided that the Japan Meteorological Agency would name the systems rather than the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Frontier Foundation {{attorney}} Corynne McSherry and Paul Levy of Public Citizen {{commented on}} the case to Ars Technica, calling Beck's trademark claim before the WIPO ridiculous. The Citizen Media Law Project agreed with this assessment. Levy noted that domain names, in and of themselves, {{could be seen as}} defamatory; however, the statement in the domain <b>name</b> <b>would</b> have to be deemed both false and malicious. Levy and McSherry thought that the filing may have been to ascertain Eiland-Hall's identity, which was anonymous prior to the complaint. McSherry couldn't recall a prior case where an individual asserted a domain name was libelous. Jack Bremer of The First Post wrote that the attempt by Beck's lawyers arguing the domain name of the website was itself defamatory had likely never occurred before in the field of information technology law.|$|E
5|$|In March 2009, Dave Whelan {{acquired}} {{a chain of}} fitness clubs from JJB Sports. In the process, Whelan used the business {{to set up a}} new venture, DWSportsfitness and announced that the stadium <b>name</b> <b>would</b> change to the DW Stadium in August. Whelan also announced {{that at the same time}} the stadium was renamed, its ownership would pass from himself to Wigan Athletic. Concerns about the future of Wigan Warriors were arrested in the same announcement, as Whelan extended the lease on the stadium by 50 years for the rugby league team. Before their match against Leeds Rhinos in July 2009, both clubs were given the opportunity to rename one stand, with the intention of renaming them in honour to a recognised player from each club's history. The rugby league club were granted the East Stand, which they renamed 'The Boston Stand' in tribute to the Welsh winger Billy Boston, As Wigan Athletic had spent many years in the lower leagues it was recognised that most of their players were not known, so the West Stand was renamed 'The Springfield Stand' after the club's former ground.|$|E

5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} world than he has {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his <b>name</b> <b>would</b> deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E
5|$|In {{the naming}} scheme as {{originally}} developed, these substems mostly {{consist of a}} consonant, a vowel, then another consonant. The final letter may be dropped if the resulting <b>name</b> <b>would</b> be difficult to pronounce otherwise. Examples include -ci(r)- for the circulatory system, -li(m)- for the immune system (lim stands for lymphocyte) and -ne(r)- for the nervous system. The final letter is usually omitted if the following source substem begins with a consonant (such as -zu- or -xi-), but not all target substems are used in their shortened form. -mul-, for example, is never reduced to -mu- because no chimeric or humanized antibodies targeting the musculoskeletal system ever received an INN. Combination of target and source substems results in endings like -limumab (immune system, human) or -ciximab (circulatory system, chimeric, consonant r dropped).|$|E
5|$|On September 8, 1995, Cedar Point {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new roller coaster, which would open as the tallest, fastest, and longest stand-up roller coaster in the world. The ride was to be named Banshee after the mythical wailing ghost in Irish folklore. In the days following the announcement, there was some negative reaction from the public regarding the term Banshee, which in the dictionary is described as a female spirit that warns of an impending family death. On November 14, 1995, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name Mantis, which later became the ride's official name. As a result of the name change, its logo was also changed to resemble a mantis. The discarded <b>name</b> <b>would</b> later be reused for Banshee at Kings Island which opened in 2014.|$|E

5|$|The Moroccan Division was {{initially}} raised as the Marching Division of Morocco. The division comprised units of varying origins {{and although the}} <b>name</b> <b>would</b> indicate otherwise, it did not in fact contain any units originating from Morocco. Moroccans {{were part of the}} Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion which was formed from the merger of the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment with the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 2nd Foreign Regiment, both also part of the Moroccan Division Brigades. The division contained Tirailleurs and Zouaves, of principally Tunisian and Algerian origin, and most notably Legionnaires from the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment and the 7th Algerian Tirailleurs Regiment. The French Legionnaires came, as attested to by a plaque installed on the memorial, from 52 different countries and included amongst them American, Polish, Russian, Italian, Greek, German, Czech, Swedish and Swiss volunteers, such as writer Blaise Cendrars.|$|E
5|$|When it {{was first}} raised, an {{auxiliary}} regiment would have been recruited from the native tribe or people whose name it bore. In the early Julio-Claudian period, it seems that {{efforts were made to}} preserve the ethnic integrity of units, even when the regiment was posted in a faraway province. But in the later part of the period, recruitment in the region where the regiment was posted increased and became predominant from the Flavian era onwards. The regiment would thus lose its original ethnic identity. The unit's <b>name</b> <b>would</b> thus become a mere curiosity devoid of meaning, although some of its members might inherit foreign names from their veteran ancestors. This view has to be qualified, however, as evidence from military diplomas and other inscriptions shows that some units continued to recruit in their original home areas e.g. Batavi units stationed in Britain, where some units had an international membership. It also appears that the Danubian provinces (Raetia, Pannonia, Moesia, Dacia) remained key recruiting grounds for units stationed all over the empire.|$|E
5|$|Within the Eastern Pacific basin {{the naming}} of {{tropical}} cyclones started in 1960, with four sets of female names initially designed to be used consecutively before being repeated. In 1965 after two lists of names had been used, {{it was decided to}} return {{to the top of the}} second list and to start recycling the sets of names on an annual basis. In 1977 after protests by various women's rights groups, NOAA made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the WMO to select new sets of names. The WMO selected six lists of names which contained male names and rotated every six years. They also decided that the new lists of hurricane <b>name</b> <b>would</b> start to be used in 1978 which was a year earlier than the Atlantic. Since 1978 the same lists of names have been used, with names of significant tropical cyclones removed from the lists and replaced with new names.|$|E
