5|$|Pregnant and {{breastfeeding}} women, {{who require}} 66% more daily iodine requirement than <b>non-pregnant</b> women, may still not be getting enough iodine. The World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of 250µg for pregnant and breastfeeding women. As many women will not achieve this from dietary sources alone, the American Thyroid Association recommends a 150µg daily supplement by mouth.|$|E
5|$|Nutrition plays a {{major role}} in and individual’s overall health; {{psychological}} and physical health status is often dramatically impacted by the presence of malnutrition. India currently has one of the highest rates of malnourished women among developing countries. A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of <b>non-pregnant</b> women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in <b>non-pregnant</b> females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{for both}} {{pregnant}} and <b>non-pregnant</b> women is usually with metronidazole, by mouth once. Caution {{should be used}} in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Sexual partners, even if they have no symptoms, should also be treated.|$|E
25|$|Familial {{inheritance}} {{has been}} found in 4–14% of cases. Bell's palsy is {{three times more likely to}} occur in pregnant women than <b>non-pregnant</b> women. It is also considered to be four times more likely to occur in diabetics than the general population.|$|E
25|$|Pregnant {{women can}} also be exposed to toxins in the workplace, {{including}} airborne particles. The effects of wearing N95 filtering facepiece respirators are similar for pregnant women as <b>non-pregnant</b> women, and wearing a respirator for one hour {{does not affect the}} fetal heart rate.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{is used in}} <b>non-pregnant</b> {{women with}} a delayed {{menstruation}} {{of one or more}} weeks, in order to allow the thickened endometrial lining to slough off. This process is termed a progesterone withdrawal bleed. The progesterone is taken orally for a short time (usually one week), after which the progesterone is discontinued and bleeding should occur.|$|E
25|$|House Democrats, with 45 Republicans, later {{compromised}} {{and passed}} a bill that expanded the plan by $35 billion and would have insured about 3.5 million more children from families generally making between 250% and 300% of the federal poverty line (about $51,000 to $62,000 {{for a family of}} four). Most <b>non-pregnant,</b> childless adults were excluded, as were most legal immigrants and all illegal immigrants. Doolittle voted against the bill.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{compounds}} in valerian produce {{central nervous system}} depression, {{they should not be}} used with other depressants, such as ethanol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, kava, or antihistamine drugs. Moreover, <b>non-pregnant</b> adult human hepatotoxicity has been associated with short-term use (i.e., a few days to several months) of herbal preparations containing valerian and Scutellaria (commonly called skullcap). Withdrawal after long-term use in a male has also been associated with benzodiazepine-like withdrawal symptoms, resulting in cardiac complications and delirium.|$|E
25|$|Screening for rubella {{susceptibility}} {{by history}} of vaccination or by serology is recommended in the United States {{for all women}} of childbearing age at their first preconception counseling visit to reduce incidence of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). It is recommended that all susceptible <b>non-pregnant</b> {{women of childbearing age}} should be offered rubella vaccination. Due to concerns about possible teratogenicity, use of MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy. Instead, susceptible pregnant women should be vaccinated as soon as possible in the postpartum period.|$|E
25|$|Breast cancers {{occur during}} {{pregnancy}} {{at the same}} rate as breast cancers in <b>non-pregnant</b> women of the same age. Breast cancer then becomes more common in the 5 or 10 years following pregnancy but then becomes less common than among the general population. These cancers are known as postpartum breast cancer and have worse outcomes including an increased risk of distant spread of disease and mortality. Other cancers found during or shortly after pregnancy appear at approximately the same rate as other cancers in women of a similar age.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of pregnancy may be detected either based on symptoms {{by the woman}} herself, or by using pregnancy tests. However, an important condition with serious health implications that is quite common is the denial of pregnancy by the pregnant woman. About one in 475 denials will last until around the 20th week of pregnancy. The proportion of cases of denial, persisting until delivery is about 1 in 2500. Conversely, some <b>non-pregnant</b> women {{have a very strong}} belief that they are pregnant along with some of the physical changes. This condition is known as a false pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Relaxin is {{a hormone}} {{produced}} mainly by the corpus luteum of the ovary and breast, in both pregnant and <b>non-pregnant</b> females. During pregnancy {{it is also}} produced by the placenta, chorion, and decidua. The body produces relaxin during menstruation that rises to a peak within approximately 14 days of ovulation and then declines. In pregnant cycles, rather than subsiding, relaxin secretion continues to rise during the first trimester and then again in the final weeks. During pregnancy relaxin has a diverse range of effects, including the production and remodelling of collagen thus increasing the elasticity of muscles, tendons, ligaments and tissues of the birth canal in view of delivery.|$|E
25|$|The EFSA panel also {{determined}} intakes for different populations. Recommended intake volumes {{in the elderly}} {{are the same as}} for adults as despite lower energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity. Pregnant and breastfeeding women require additional fluids to stay hydrated. The EFSA panel proposes that pregnant women should consume the same volume of water as <b>non-pregnant</b> women, plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement, equal to 300 mL/day. To compensate for additional fluid output, breastfeeding women require an additional 700 mL/day above the recommended intake values for non-lactating women. Dehydration and over-hydration - too little and too much water, respectively - can have harmful consequences. Drinking too much water is one of the possible causes of hyponatremia, i.e., low serum sodium.|$|E
25|$|The {{three major}} {{naturally}} occurring estrogens in women are estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3). Estradiol is the predominant estrogen during reproductive years {{both in terms}} of absolute serum levels as well as in terms of estrogenic activity. During menopause, estrone is the predominant circulating estrogen and during pregnancy estriol is the predominant circulating estrogen in terms of serum levels. Though estriol is the most plentiful of the three estrogens it is also the weakest, whereas estradiol is the strongest with a potency of approximately 80 times that of estriol. Thus, estradiol is the most important estrogen in <b>non-pregnant</b> females who are between the menarche and menopause stages of life. However, during pregnancy this role shifts to estriol, and in postmenopausal women estrone becomes the primary form of estrogen in the body. Another type of estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy. All of the different forms of estrogen are synthesized from androgens, specifically testosterone and androstenedione, by the enzyme aromatase.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Xu et al. at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute {{used the}} 3D VIP-Man phantom to {{simulate}} respiratory motions by adopting the gated respiratory motion {{data of the}} NCAT phantom. The 4D VIP-Man Chest phantom was used to study external-beam treatment planning for a lung cancer patient. In 2007, Xu's research group reported creation {{of a series of}} polygon-based phantoms representing a pregnant woman and her fetus at the end of 3, 6, and 9 month gestations (RPI Pregnant Females). The mesh data were initially obtained from separate anatomical information sources including a <b>non-pregnant</b> female, a 7-month pregnant woman CT data set, and a mesh model of the fetus. In 2008, two triangular mesh-based phantoms were created, named as RPI Deformable Adult Male and Female (RPI-AM, RPI-FM). The anatomic parameters of the phantoms were made consistent with two datasets: the mass and density of internal organs originated from ICRP-23 and ICRP-89, and the whole-body height and weight percentile data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999-2002). Later on, to study the relationship between breast size and lung dosimetry, a new group of phantoms were produced by altering the breast geometry of RPI-AF.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{treatment}} for {{carbon monoxide poisoning}} is to immediately remove the person from the exposure without endangering further people. Those who are unconscious may require CPR on site. [...] Administering oxygen via non-rebreather mask shortens the half-life of carbon monoxide from 320 minutes, when breathing normal air, to only 80 minutes. Oxygen hastens the dissociation of carbon monoxide from carboxyhemoglobin, thus turning it back into hemoglobin. Due to the possible severe effects in the fetus, pregnant women are treated with oxygen {{for longer periods of}} time than <b>non-pregnant</b> people.|$|E
500|$|The cervix or cervix uteri (...) is {{the lower}} part of the uterus in the human female {{reproductive}} system. In a <b>non-pregnant</b> woman, the cervix is usually 2 to 3cm long (~1 inch) and roughly cylindrical in shape. The narrow, central cervical canal runs along its entire length, connecting the uterine cavity and the lumen of the vagina. The opening into the uterus is called the internal os, and the opening into the vagina is called the external os. The lower part of the cervix, known as the vaginal portion of the cervix (or ectocervix), bulges into the top of the vagina. The cervix has been documented anatomically since at least the time of Hippocrates, over 2,000 years ago.|$|E

The length of the skull is less than [...] The tail is short, averaging [...] in length. The bodyweight ranges between , with an average mass of [...] for males and [...] for females. There are, however, large seasonal variations in bodyweight, and individuals up to [...] have been recorded. The animal tends to have significantly higher bodyweights during the winter months, about 50 percent higher than the lowest values in the summer. The weight gains, achieved largely by increasing food intake, are triggered by changes in the length of the day and night. This seasonal change in bodyweight occurs in both sexes, in both pregnant and <b>non-pregnant</b> females—an adaptation thought to help ensure survival during winter when food resources become scarce. The species has distinctive teeth morphology: its third molar is triangular in outline and only slightly smaller than the first molar; its second molar is the largest. The incisors and canines on its lower jaw are procumbent (tilt forward) and together form a toothcomb that is used in grooming and feeding.|$|E

Morning sickness, and {{associated}} aversions to {{certain types of}} food, during pregnancy {{seemed to have the}} characteristics of an evolved adaptation (complexity and universality). Margie Profet hypothesized that the function was to avoid the ingestion of toxins during early pregnancy that could damage fetus (but which are otherwise likely to be harmless to healthy <b>non-pregnant</b> women).|$|E
2500|$|Nutrition during {{pregnancy}} {{is important to}} ensure healthy growth of the fetus. [...] Nutrition {{during pregnancy}} {{is different from the}} <b>non-pregnant</b> state. [...] There are increased energy requirements and specific micronutrient requirements. Women benefit from education to encourage a balanced energy and protein intake during pregnancy. Some women may need professional medical advice if their diet is affected by medical conditions, food allergies, or specific religious/ ethical beliefs.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "fourth {{stage of}} labour" [...] is the period {{beginning}} {{immediately after the}} birth of a child and extending for about six weeks. The terms postpartum and postnatal are often used to describe this period. The woman's body, including hormone levels and uterus size, return to a <b>non-pregnant</b> state and the newborn adjusts to life outside the mother's body. [...] The World Health Organization (WHO) describes the postnatal period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies; most deaths occur during the postnatal period.|$|E

According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), waist circumference in excess of [...] for men and [...] for (<b>non-pregnant)</b> women, is considered to imply a high risk for type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and CVD. Waist circumference can be a better indicator of obesity-related disease risk than BMI. For example, {{this is the case}} in populations of Asian descent and older people. [...] for men and [...] for women has been stated to pose [...] "higher risk", with the NIH figures [...] "even higher".|$|E
2500|$|Treatment is {{generally}} {{the same as}} for <b>non-pregnant</b> women. However, radiation is normally avoided during pregnancy, especially if the fetal dose might exceed 100 cGy. In some cases, some or all treatments are postponed until after birth if the cancer is diagnosed late in the pregnancy. Early deliveries to speed the start of treatment are not uncommon. Surgery {{is generally}} considered safe during pregnancy, but some other treatments, especially certain chemotherapy drugs given during the first trimester, increase the risk of birth defects and pregnancy loss (spontaneous abortions and stillbirths). [...] Elective abortions are not required and do not improve the likelihood of the mother surviving or being cured.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect of}} {{pregnancy}} on prospective memory {{is still under}} current study. Rendell et al. (2008) tested the prospective memory of 20 pregnant women in the laboratory. There {{were no significant differences}} observed between pregnant and <b>non-pregnant</b> women for event-based prospective memory tasks, but there were clear hindrances in performance for pregnant women in time-based prospective memory tasks such as a job deadline. Pregnant women [...] are more likely to remember to perform an intention after the cue has already passed. Further, women tested a few months after giving birth were found to forget intentions entirely. Both these findings may be related to stress encountered during pregnancy or child rearing and lack of sleep.|$|E
2500|$|The common feature {{among the}} family Emballonuridae is the sheath tail, meaning {{that there is}} a {{membrane}} that stretches from one of the bat's ankles to its other, and the majority of the tail is covered by the membrane, with only the tip protruding. Its wing attaches to its ankle and its tail protrudes approximately 6mm away from its body. The average weight of a male is 6.1 g, and for the <b>non-pregnant</b> female the average weight is 7.1 g; their average body length is 66.6mm. Unlike in many other bat species, there is no dorsal furrow between the nares, and the rostrum has been described as [...] "inflated".

2500|$|... {{is where}} the hCG level does not spontaneously decline and no intrauterine or ectopic {{pregnancy}} is identified on follow-up transvaginal ultrasonography. A persisting PUL is likely either a small ectopic pregnancy {{that has not been}} visualized, or a retained trophoblast in the endometrial cavity. Treatment should only be considered when a potentially viable intrauterine pregnancy has been definitively excluded. A treated persistent PUL is defined as one managed medically (generally with methotrexate) without confirmation of the location of the pregnancy such as by ultrasound, laparoscopy or uterine evacuation. A resolved persistent PUL is defined as serum hCG reaching a <b>non-pregnant</b> value (generally less than 5 IU/l) after expectant management, or after uterine evacuation without evidence of chorionic villi on histopathological examination. In contrast, a relatively low and unresolving level of serum hCG indicates the possibility of an hCG-secreting tumour.|$|E

Between the ages of 40 to 44, 54.7% of men, 88.7% of women, and 69.2% of pregnant women tested positive for HSV-1 antibodies. The overall age-gender standardized seroprevelance for HSV-1 antibodies was 51.1%.
