25|$|A {{non-inverting}} amplifier is {{a special}} case of the differential amplifier in which that circuit's inverting input V1 is grounded, and <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input</b> V2 is identified with Vin above, with R1 ≫ R2.|$|E
25|$|In this case, the {{operational}} amplifier drives the transistor with more current if the voltage at its inverting input drops below {{the output of}} the voltage reference at the <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input.</b> Using the voltage divider (R1, R2 and R3) allows choice of the arbitrary output voltage between Uz and Uin.|$|E
25|$|Without {{negative}} feedback, {{and perhaps}} with positive feedback for regeneration, an op-amp {{acts as a}} comparator. If the inverting input is held at ground (0V) directly or by a resistor Rg, and the input voltage Vin applied to the <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input</b> is positive, the output will be maximum positive; if Vin is negative, the output will be maximum negative. Since there is no feedback from the output to either input, this is an open-loop circuit acting as a comparator.|$|E

5000|$|Input {{bias current}} — {{a small amount}} of current (typically ~10 nA for bipolar FDAs, or picoamperes for CMOS designs) flows into the inputs. This current is {{mismatched}} slightly between the inverting and <b>non-inverting</b> <b>inputs</b> (there is an input offset current). This effect is usually important only for very low power circuits.|$|R
2500|$|... 1941: A {{vacuum tube}} op-amp. An op-amp, {{defined as a}} general-purpose, DC-coupled, high gain, {{inverting}} feedback amplifier, is first found in [...] "Summing Amplifier" [...] filed by Karl D. Swartzel Jr. of Bell Labs in 1941. This design used three vacuum tubes to achieve a gain of [...] and operated on voltage rails of [...] It had a single inverting input rather than differential inverting and <b>non-inverting</b> <b>inputs,</b> as are common in today's op-amps. Throughout World War II, Swartzel's design proved its value by being liberally used in the M9 artillery director designed at Bell Labs. This artillery director worked with the SCR584 radar system to achieve extraordinary hit rates (near 90%) {{that would not have}} been possible otherwise.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input</b> of the {{operational}} amplifier needs {{a path for}} DC to ground; if the signal source does not supply a DC path, or if that source requires a given load impedance, then the circuit will require another resistor from the <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input</b> to ground. When {{the operational}} amplifier's input bias currents are significant, then the DC source resistances driving the inputs should be balanced. [...] The ideal value for the feedback resistors (to give minimal offset voltage) will be such that the two resistances in parallel roughly equal the resistance to ground at the <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input</b> pin. [...] That ideal value assumes the bias currents are well matched, {{which may not be}} true for all op-amps.|$|E
2500|$|... 1949: A chopper-stabilized op-amp. In 1949, Edwin A. Goldberg {{designed}} a chopper-stabilized op-amp. This set-up uses a normal op-amp {{with an additional}} AC amplifier that goes alongside the op-amp. The chopper gets an AC signal from DC by switching between the DC voltage and ground at a fast rate (60Hz or 400Hz). This signal is then amplified, rectified, filtered and fed into the op-amp's <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input.</b> This vastly improved the gain of the op-amp while significantly reducing the output drift and DC offset. Unfortunately, any design that used a chopper couldn't use their <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input</b> for any other purpose. Nevertheless, the much improved characteristics of the chopper-stabilized op-amp made it the dominant way to use op-amps. Techniques that used the <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input</b> regularly would not be very popular until the 1960s when op-amp ICs started {{to show up in}} the field.|$|E

5000|$|The Wien bridge {{does not}} require equal values of R or C. The phase of the signal at Vp {{relative}} to the signal at Vout varies from almost 90° leading at low frequency to almost 90° lagging at high frequency. At some intermediate frequency, the phase shift will be zero. At that frequency the ratio of Z1 to Z2 will be purely real (zero imaginary part). If the ratio of Rb to Rf is adjusted to the same ratio, then the bridge is balanced and the circuit can sustain oscillation. The circuit will oscillate even if Rb / Rf has a small phase shift {{and even if the}} inverting and <b>non-inverting</b> <b>inputs</b> of the amplifier have different phase shifts. There will always be a frequency at which the total phase shift of each branch of the bridge will be equal. If Rb / Rf has no phase shift and the phase shifts of the amplifiers inputs are zero then the bridge is balanced when: ...|$|R
40|$|Op amps {{have many}} applications. They {{are used in}} a wide variety of {{mathematical}} applications as a fundamental element of a mathematical circuit. Some more complicated models of an op amp have different properties such as input offset voltage, dc gain, bias current, input and output resistance. To account for these properties, more complicated models are required. This section will ignore practical and more advanced models and focus on the ideal operational amplifier. This module introduces the operational amplifier in a circuit. We will explore the purpose of an op amp, look at the characteristics and examine examples of it. This section will focus on the ideal op amp and show circuits with op amps designed to fulfill a purpose. Ideal Operational Amplifiers Ideal op amps consist of 5 main connections: Two connected voltages which act as the positive and negative voltage supply and (often these are not shown in circuit diagrams), two other inputs act as the inverting and <b>non-inverting</b> <b>inputs</b> and, and an output signal.

40|$|The MC 10 E/ 100 E 116 is a quint {{differential}} line receiver with emitter-follower outputs. For applications which require bandwidths {{greater than that}} of the E 116, the E 416 device may be of interest. Active current sources plus a deep collector feature of the MOSAIC III process provide the receivers with excellent common-mode noise rejection. Each receiver has a dedicated VCCO supply lead, providing optimum symmetry and stability. If both inverting and <b>non-inverting</b> <b>inputs</b> are at an equal potential of> − 2. 5 V, the receiver does not go to a defined state, but rather current-shares in normal differential amplifier fashion, producing output voltage levels midway between HIGH and LOW, or the device may even oscillate. The VBB pin, an internally generated voltage supply, is available to this device only. For single-ended input conditions, the unused differential input is connected to VBB as a switching reference voltage. VBB may also rebias AC coupled inputs. When used, decouple VBB and VCC via a 0. 01 �F capacitor and limit current sourcing or sinking to 0. 5 mA. When not used, VBB should be left open. The 100 Series contains temperature compensation...|$|R

40|$|Ordinary {{thermocouples}} use {{the well-known}} Seebeck effect {{to measure the}} temperature at the junction of two different conductors. The electromotive force generated by the heat depends on {{the difference between the}} respective thermoelectric powers of the contacting metals and the junction temperature. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the thermoelectric measurement as most often used in nondestructive materials characterization. One of the reference electrodes is heated by electrical means to a preset temperature of 100 – 300 °C, pretty much like the tip of a temperature-stabilized soldering iron, and connected to the inverting (−) input of the differential amplifier driving the indicator. The other electrode is left cold at essentially room temperature and connected to the <b>non-inverting</b> (+) <b>input.</b> The measurement is done quickly in a few seconds to assure (i) that the hot reference electrode is not cooled down perceivably by the specimen and (ii) {{that the rest of the}} specimen beyond the close vicinity of the contact point is not warmed up perceivably. Ideally, regardless of the temperature difference between the junctions, only thermocouples made of different materials, i. e., materials of different thermoelectric power, will generate thermoelectric signal. This unique feature makes the simple thermoelectric tester one of the most sensitive material discriminators used in nondestructive inspection...|$|R
2500|$|Another typical {{configuration}} of op-amps is with positive feedback, which takes {{a fraction of}} the output signal back to the <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input.</b> An important application of it is the comparator with hysteresis, the Schmitt trigger. [...] Some circuits may use positive feedback and negative feedback around the same amplifier, for example triangle-wave oscillators and active filters.|$|E
2500|$|... 1953: A commercially {{available}} op-amp. In 1953, vacuum tube op-amps became {{commercially available}} {{with the release}} of the model K2-W from George A. Philbrick Researches, Incorporated. [...] The designation on the devices shown, GAP/R, is an acronym for the complete company name. Two nine-pin 12AX7 vacuum tubes were mounted in an octal package and had a model K2-P chopper add-on available that would effectively [...] "use up" [...] the <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input.</b> This op-amp was based on a descendant of Loebe Julie's 1947 design and, along with its successors, would start the widespread use of op-amps in industry.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{comparator}} {{does not}} have internal hysteresis or if the input noise {{is greater than the}} internal hysteresis then an external hysteresis network can be built using positive feedback from the output to the <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input</b> of the comparator. The resulting Schmitt trigger circuit gives additional noise immunity and a cleaner output signal. Some comparators such as , , , [...] and [...] also provide the hysteresis control through a separate hysteresis pin. These comparators make it possible to add a programmable hysteresis without feedback or complicated equations. Using a dedicated hysteresis pin is also convenient if the source impedance is high since the inputs are isolated from the hysteresis network. When hysteresis is added then a comparator cannot resolve signals within the hysteresis band.|$|E
2500|$|... 1947: An op-amp with an {{explicit}} <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input.</b> In 1947, the operational amplifier was first formally defined and named {{in a paper}} by John R. Ragazzini of Columbia University. In this same paper a footnote mentioned an op-amp design by a student that {{would turn out to}} be quite significant. This op-amp, designed by Loebe Julie, was superior in a variety of ways. It had two major innovations. Its input stage used a long-tailed triode pair with loads matched to reduce drift in the output and, far more importantly, it was the first op-amp design to have two inputs (one inverting, the other non-inverting). The differential input made a whole range of new functionality possible, but it would not be used for a long time due to the rise of the chopper-stabilized amplifier.|$|E
2500|$|A null {{detector}} {{is one that}} functions to identify when a given value is zero. Comparators can be a type of amplifier distinctively for null comparison measurements. It is the equivalent to a very high gain amplifier with well-balanced inputs and controlled output limits. The circuit compares the two input voltages, determining the larger. The inputs are an unknown voltage and a reference voltage, usually referred to as vu and vr. A reference voltage is generally on the <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input</b> (+), while vu is usually on the inverting input (...) [...] (A circuit diagram would display the inputs according to their sign {{with respect to the}} output when a particular input is greater than the other.) [...] The output is either positive or negative, for example ±12V. In this case, the idea is to detect when there is no difference between in the input voltages. This gives the identity of the unknown voltage since the reference voltage is known.|$|E
2500|$|This {{portion of}} the op amp cleverly changes a {{differential}} signal at the op amp inputs to a single-ended signal {{at the base of}} Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the inverting input (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in a decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input</b> (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on current mirror Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 emitter current is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base drive current for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3dB of gain here, this technique decreases common-mode gain and feedthrough of power supply noise.|$|E

50|$|This {{is because}} the <b>non-{{inverting}}</b> <b>input</b> {{is less than the}} inverting input, and as the output continues to decrease, the difference between the inputs gets more and more negative. Again, the inverting input approaches the comparator's output voltage asymptotically, and the cycle repeats itself once the <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input</b> is greater than the inverting input, hence the system oscillates.|$|E

The difference between the <b>non-inverting</b> <b>input</b> voltage and the inverting input voltage is amplified by the op-amp.
