Each force influences three of the <b>neutral</b> <b>planes,</b> but with surprising effects." [...] He found three of the set's quick-start adventures to be [...] "excellent, drawing {{on the nature of the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>planes</b> to give the game and the NPCs contained within real power", but he felt that [...] "Militancy Justifies The Means", the remaining adventure, [...] "wibbles on too much about the politics of conflict, but works fine as a standard Planescape outing". As part of the Planescape line, Webb felt that the production standards [...] "continue to shame all other TSR offerings with quality artwork, powerful design and crisp text. Planes of Conflict links perfectly into other Planescape works, and die-hard cutters will instantly want to plunge their parties into all manner of neutral nastiness." [...] He concluded the review by stating that with this expansion pack, [...] "Planescape confirms its position as the premier AD&D world.

5000|$|The {{standard}} Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) cosmology contains seventeen Outer Planes. Cosmologically, {{they are}} arranged in a ring of sixteen planes with the Good-aligned planes, or Upper Planes at the top, and the Evil-aligned planes, or Lower Planes at the bottom. Depictions usually display the Lawful planes (or Planes of Law) to the left, and the Chaotic planes (or Planes of Chaos) to the right. Between all of these sit the <b>Neutral</b> <b>planes,</b> or the Planes of Conflict. One further plane sits in {{the centre of the}} ring, the Outlands, being neutral in alignment. At the center of the Outlands is a Spire of infinite height; the city of Sigil floats above the Spire's pinnacle.

40|$|In {{this work}} we present {{an attempt to}} measure repulsive Casimir force. The Casimir force is a direct manifestation of {{boundary}} dependence of quantum vacuum due to the alteration by {{the boundaries of the}} zero-point electromagnetic energy. This phenomena was first described by H. B. G. Casimir in 1948 [1] with an explanation of retarded Van-der-Waals interactions. Casimir found an expression of a finite and attractive force between two infinite and <b>neutral</b> <b>planes.</b> This positive Casimir force has been measured several times, between a sphere and a plane, using different methodologies [2, 3]. Few years ago the existence of a repulsive Casimir force was also predicted [4]. The Casimir effect is strong dependent on boundary. Size, geometry, topology and materials that compose the boundary can switch the force from attractive to repulsive. Kenneth and co-workers [4] predicted the repulsive Casimir force between element 1 and 2 immersed in a medium 3, with the relation between their permitivities as ε 1 >ε 3 >ε 2. Gold, bromobenzene and silica fulfill this relation, and have been used by Capasso and co-workers [5] to measure, for the first time, the repulsive Casimir force. On the other hand, repulsive Casimir force due to the geometry of the boundary was predicte...|$|R

5000|$|Since an {{armature}} {{is wound}} with coils of wire, {{a magnetic field}} is {{set up in the}} armature whenever a current flows in the coils. This field is at right angles to the generator field, and is called cross magnetization of the armature. The effect of the armature field is to distort the generator field and shift the <b>neutral</b> <b>plane.</b> The <b>neutral</b> <b>plane</b> is the position where the armature windings are moving parallel to the magnetic flux lines, that is why an axis lying in this plane is called as magnetic neutral axis (MNA).

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{nature of}} the equation of state of seawater leads to numerous interesting processes in the ocean. Two of the more well-known processes caused by nonlinearities in the equation of state are cabbeling and thermobaricity. Other nonlinearities lead to difficulties in analyzing water-mass transformation on continuous 'density' surfaces due to the ill-defined nature of neutral surfaces. This ill-defined nature of neutral surfaces describes the problem {{of not being able}} to globally connect <b>neutral</b> tangent <b>planes,</b> i. e. planes which describe the local mixing direction of fluid particles in the absence of diapycnal mixing, to form a well-defined surface in three-dimensional space. All these processes have been known to exist for quite some time but their impact on ocean circulation and its analysis remains elusive. In this work an algorithm is introduced which improves the description of existing density surfaces to ensure that the resulting surfaces are as close to approximating <b>neutral</b> tangent <b>planes</b> as possible. Because of the remaining slope errors between these continuous 'density' surfaces and the <b>neutral</b> tangent <b>planes,</b> even in the absence of diapycnal mixing processes fluid trajectories penetrate through any continuous 'density' surfaces. This leads to a fictitious diapycnal diffusivity and an extra physical mechanism that achieves mean vertical advection in the ocean through any continuous 'density' surface. Using these accurate density surfaces, the effects of cabbeling, thermobaricity and the diapycnal advection due to the ill-defined nature of neutral surfaces are quantified. It is shown that these processes cause a significant downward diapycnal transport on the order of 6 Sv, concentrated in the Southern Ocean. This additional production of dense water has implications on the ocean's energetics which is discussed in this work. A new form of vertical advection, similar to the diapycnal advection due to the ill-defined nature of neutral surfaces but caused by temporal changes of the ocean's hydrography instead of spatial changes, is also introduced here. Another consequence of the ill-defined nature of neutral surface is the non-existence of a geostrophic streamfunction. New approximate expressions for the geostrophic streamfunction are also developed and are shown to be significantly more accurate than previously available expressions. All the algorithms described and the used to quantify the diapycnal velocities caused by nonlinearities in the equation of state are implemented in Matlab.

40|$|The {{materiality}} and neutrality {{of neutral}} density and several forms of orthobaric density are calculated and compared using a simple idealization of the warm-sphere water mass {{properties of the}} Atlantic Ocean. Materiality {{is the value of}} the material derivative, expressed as a quasi-vertical velocity, following the motion of each of the variables: zero materiality denotes perfect conservation. Neutrality is the difference between the dip in the isopleth surfaces of the respective variables and the dip in the <b>neutral</b> <b>planes.</b> The materiality and neutrality of the neutral density of a water sample are composed of contributions from the following: (I) how closely the sample’s temperature and salinity lie in relation to the local reference θ–S relation, (II) the spatial variation of the reference θ–S relation, (III) the neutrality of the underlying reference neutral density surfaces, and (IV) irreversible exchanges of heat and salinity. Type II contributions dominate but have been neglected in previous assessments of neutral density properties. The materiality and neutrality of surfaces of simple orthobaric density, defined using a spatially uniform θ–S relation, have contributions analogous to types I and IV, but lack any of types II or III. Extending the concept of orthobaric density to permit spatial variation of the θ–S relation diminishes the type I contributions, but the effect is counterbalanced by the emergence of type II contributions. Discrete analogs of extended orthobaric density, based on regionally averaged θ–S relations matched at interregional boundaries, reveal a close analogy between the extended orthobaric density and the practical neutral density. Neutral density is not superior, even to simple orthobaric density, in terms of materiality or neutrality...|$|R
