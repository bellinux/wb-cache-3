5|$|The Lithuanian Democratic Party and Ernestas Galvanauskas {{used the}} Seimas as an {{opportunity}} to organize the Peasant Union, which largely represented the interests of large and mid-size farmers. The Union helped spread the influence of the Seimas into the countryside. A few days after the Seimas, Jonas Basanavičius founded the Lithuanian <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (Lithuanian: Tautiškoji lietuvių demokratų partija), the first nationalistic party in Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|An {{imbalance}} {{was created}} in the polity by the result of the 1961 plebiscite. Southern Cameroon opted to join the Republic of Cameroon while Northern Cameroons chose to remain in Nigeria. The northern part of the country was now far larger than the southern part. In 1963, the nation established a Federal Republic, with Azikiwe as its first president. When elections were held in 1965, the Nigerian <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> came to power in Nigeria's Western Region.|$|E
5|$|At the 1896 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Democrats {{nominated}} William Jennings Bryan {{for president}} and adopted a platform calling for the free coinage of silver. Gold standard Democrats opposed Bryan and the free silver platform. They formed a new party—the <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> or Gold Democrats—which Buckner joined. At the new party's state convention in Louisville, Buckner's name was proposed {{as a candidate for}} vice president. He was given the nomination without opposition at the party's national convention in Indianapolis. Former Union general John Palmer was chosen as the party's nominee for president.|$|E

5|$|During his term, Brown {{served as}} {{co-chairman}} of the Appalachian Regional Commission {{and chair of the}} Southern States' Energy Board. In May 1981, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Kentucky, and in May 1982, he was the recipient of the Father of the Year award.

5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not mingle with foreigners and declared that he would vote for the far right <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{maintained}} good {{contacts with}} nationalist parties throughout Europe and other countries. The Vlaams Blok did traditionally have the closest contacts with Dutch and South African far-right groups, including the Dutch Centre Party '86, the Centre Democrats and Voorpost, and the South African Boerestaat Party. In the mid-1980s, it also established close relations {{particularly with the}} French National Front, {{as well as the}} German People's Union, The Republicans and <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> of Germany. In the 1990s, it supported the minor Dutch Block party, which had modeled itself directly on the Vlaams Blok.|$|E

50|$|Delegates from forty-one states {{gathered}} at the <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party's</b> <b>national</b> nominating convention in Indianapolis on September 2. Some delegates planned to nominate Cleveland, but they relented after a telegram arrived stating {{that he would not}} accept. Senator William Freeman Vilas from Wisconsin, the main drafter of the <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party's</b> platform, was a favorite of the delegates. However, Vilas refused to run as the party's sacrificial lamb. The choice instead was John M. Palmer, a 79-year-old former Senator from Illinois. Simon Bolivar Buckner, a 73-year-old former governor of Kentucky, was nominated by acclamation for vice-president. The ticket, symbolic of post-Civil War reconciliation, featured the oldest combined age of the candidates in American history.|$|R
5000|$|During {{and after}} that {{movement}}, however, {{factors such as the}} <b>national</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party's</b> support for the civil-rights movement and the national Republican Party's [...] "Southern strategy" [...] and support for the application of religious values to politics eroded the South's support for the Democrats.|$|R
5|$|While Mugabe was {{teaching}} abroad, an anti-colonialist African nationalist movement {{was established in}} Southern Rhodesia. This was first led by Joshua Nkomo's Southern Rhodesia African National Congress, founded in September 1957 and then banned by the colonial government in February 1959. This {{was replaced by the}} more radically oriented <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (NDP), founded in January 1960. In May 1960, Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia, bringing Hayfron with him. The pair had planned for their visit to be short, however Mugabe's friend, the African nationalist Leopold Takawira, urged them to stay.|$|E
5|$|Decisions by Republican {{incumbent}} Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to {{not participate}} in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates. In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the <b>national</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father. In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, seen by 9.1million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|September saw Maine and Vermont go heavily Republican {{in their}} state elections, meaning the Northeast was likely safe for McKinley. Early in that month, {{dissident}} Democrats, who favored the gold standard and President Cleveland's policies, formed the <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> or Gold Democrats, meeting in Indianapolis. The nomination of Illinois Senator John M. Palmer for president and former Kentucky governor Simon Bolivar Buckner for vice president meant Bryan would have to overcome an electoral split in his party. Hanna applauded the selection, and predicted it would get large numbers of votes. There was no chance Palmer would win the election, and Hanna {{saw to it that}} the Gold Democrats were aided with quietly-provided funds.|$|E

5|$|Unlike his father, Brown {{showed only}} a passing {{interest}} in politics prior to 1979. In 1960, {{he was named}} vice-chairman of John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign in Kentucky. He {{was a member of}} the Young Leadership Council of the Democratic National Committee, and was named honorary chairman of the <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> in 1972. Later that year, he considered running for the U.S. Senate, but decided against it once former governor Louie B. Nunn entered the race. From 1972 to 1974, he hosted the Democratic National Telethon. He founded the Governor's Economic Development Commission of Kentucky and served as chair from 1975 to 1977.|$|E
5|$|The main militant African {{nationalist}} {{parties in}} each territory were {{banned by the}} federal and territorial governments, but all reorganised under new names only months later. The Southern Rhodesian ANC became the <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (later ZAPU), the Northern Rhodesian ANC became the Zambian African National Congress, and the Nyasaland ANC became the Malawi Congress Party. The media's {{use of the term}} 'police state' to describe the response to the violence outraged the Liberals, the Church of Scotland, and leftist Conservatives, and particularly the Labour Party, in Britain. John Stonehouse, a Labour MP, had been deported prior to the declaration of the state of emergency, adding to the tension. A Royal Commission was announced to investigate the violence. Welensky was indignant when asked to contribute to the Royal Commission, and the Labour Party boycotted it.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the day, police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, {{and water}} cannons into crowds during violent clashes between {{authorities}} and protesters throughout Egypt. In Port Said {{tens of thousands}} gathered and multiple government buildings were set ablaze. In Suez, police shot and killed at least one protestor. Protestors in Suez took control of a police station, freed arrested protesters and then burned down a nearby smaller local police post. The government issued an 18:00 to 7:00 curfew, but protesters ignored it and were met by police. In the evening, one of the <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (NDP) headquarters buildings in Cairo was set on fire by an unidentified culprit. While protesters paused for evening prayers, police continued firing tear gas. The day's defiance was summed up by the plethora of Tunisian national flags and anti-Mubarak graffiti that the protesters had created in the Greater Cairo region, Alexandria, Beni Suef, Mansoura and Manufiya.|$|E

5|$|During the West Virginia Democratic Party Senatorial Convention held at Moorefield in August 1886, White {{proposed}} and advocated the first tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions ever passed and {{adopted by a}} West Virginia Democratic Party Convention. Prior to its passage at the convention, White's proposal received strong opposition. Tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions similar to White's proposal were adopted by the <b>national</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> {{as part of its}} 1888 platform. White had been among the first Democratic Party members in Hampshire County to openly declare his opposition to the fiscal policies of the administration of United States President Grover Cleveland. Under White's leadership, Hampshire County's Democratic delegation was the first Democratic county organization in West Virginia to hold public meetings in opposition to Cleveland's fiscal policies. As the county executive committee chairman, White was the first Democrat in Hampshire County to deliver a public speech denouncing these policies. By 1897, White had participated as a delegate from Hampshire County to most of the Senatorial and Congressional Democratic Party conventions in West Virginia, and every state Gubernatorial convention with the exception of one.|$|E
5|$|Lutosławski's {{parents were}} both {{born into the}} Polish landed nobility. His family owned estates {{in the area of}} Drozdowo. His father Józef was {{involved}} in the Polish <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> ("Endecja"), and the Lutosławski family became intimate with its founder, Roman Dmowski (Witold Lutosławski's middle name was Roman). Józef Lutosławski studied in Zürich, where in 1904 he met and married a fellow student, Maria Olszewska, who later became Lutosławski's mother. Józef pursued his studies in London, where he acted as correspondent for the National-Democratic newspaper, Goniec. He continued to be involved in National Democracy politics after returning to Warsaw in 1905, and took over the management of the family estates in 1908. Witold Roman Lutosławski, the youngest of three brothers, was born in Warsaw shortly before the outbreak of World War I. In 1915, with Russia at war with Germany, Prussian forces drove towards Warsaw. The Lutosławskis travelled east to Moscow, where Józef remained politically active, organising Polish Legions ready for any action that might liberate Poland (which was divided according to the 1815 Congress of Vienna—Warsaw was part of Tsarist Russia). Dmowski's strategy was for Russia to guarantee security for a new Polish state. However, in 1917, the February Revolution forced the Tsar to abdicate, and the October Revolution started a new Soviet government that made peace with Germany. Józef's activities were now in conflict with the Bolsheviks, who arrested him and his brother Marian. Thus, although fighting stopped on the Eastern Front in 1917, the Lutosławskis were prevented from returning home. The brothers were interned in Butyrskaya prison in central Moscow, where Lutosławski—by then aged five—visited his father. Józef and Marian were executed by a firing squad in September 1918, some days before their scheduled trial.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to its white middle class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities from the evangelical Christian vote (including Southern pockets of traditionalist Roman Catholics as in South Louisiana), which had been nonpolitical before 1980.
