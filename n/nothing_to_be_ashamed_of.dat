500|$|In 1992, Gunn's two-year-old daughter, Francesca, was {{diagnosed}} with leukaemia. Norwich City fans were at first astonished {{by the sight of}} the goalkeeper running out with a completely shaven head. In the words of author and Norwich supporter, Kevin Baldwin, [...] "Occasionally, the gap between the crowd and the players can cause unfortunate misunderstandings. A few months ago, Gunn shaved his head and we all laughed at him ... I was especially keen ... to shout [...] "Baldy!" ... It now turns out that his daughter was undergoing chemotherapy at the time, which made her hair fall out. He shaved his head to show her that this was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of.</b> Sorry, Bryan." [...] When news spread of the reason for Gunn's shaven head, he received [...] "support from the whole of the sporting world and the people of Norfolk".|$|E
500|$|Rudolph Schnaubelt (1863–1901) was {{an activist}} and the brother-in law of Michael Schwab. He {{was at the}} Haymarket when the bomb exploded. Schnaubelt was indicted with the other {{defendants}} but fled the city and later the country before he could be brought to trial. He was the detectives' lead suspect, and state witness Gilmer testified he saw Schnaubelt throw the bomb, identifying him from a photograph in court. Schnaubelt later sent two letters from London disclaiming all responsibility, writing, [...] "If I had really thrown this bomb, surely I would have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of,</b> but in [...] truth I never once thought of it." [...] He is the most generally accepted and widely known suspect and figured as the bomb thrower in The Bomb, Frank Harris's 1908 fictionalization of the tragedy. Written from Schnaubelt's point of view, the story opens with him confessing on his deathbed. However, Harris's description was fictional and those who knew Schnaubelt vehemently criticized the book.|$|E

"The most {{important}} thing to bear in mind when arrested is that you are a volunteer of a revolutionary Army, that you have been captured by an enemy force, that your cause is a just one, that you are right and that the enemy is wrong and that as a soldier you have taken the chance expected of a soldier and that there is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> in being captured.|$|E
2500|$|Obituaries for {{her were}} {{published}} in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The Sydney Morning Herald, and the Corriere della Sera, amongst others. The Sydney Morning Herald also republished one of her last blog posts, in which she discussed how engaging with a difficult activity had taught her about helping students with their own difficulties, partly by teaching them to celebrate the little successes {{on the way to}} a goal. She wrote that, [...] "Ultimately, nothing was more helpful for me than failing repeatedly" [...] and that she wanted her students to realize that failures could be part of learning and were <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of.</b> The journal ABO, which Wadewitz had worked for from 2011 to 2012, dedicated its March 2014 issue to Wadewitz.|$|E

2500|$|On 14 April, in the Commons, Powell claimed [...] "it is {{difficult}} to fault the military and especially the naval measures which the Government have taken". He added: [...] "We are in some danger of resting our position too exclusively upon the existence, the nature and {{the wishes of the}} inhabitants of the Falkland Islands... if the population of the Falkland Islands did not desire to be British, the principle that the Queen wishes no unwilling subjects would long ago have prevailed; but we should create great difficulties for ourselves in other contexts, as well as in this context, if we rested our action purely and exclusively on the notion of restoring tolerable, acceptable conditions and self-determination to our fellow Britons on the Falkland Islands.... I do not think that we need be too nice about saying that we defend our territory as well as our people. There is nothing irrational, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of,</b> in doing that. Indeed, it is impossible in the last resort to distinguish between the defence of territory and the defence of people".|$|E
