500|$|For the song, {{which is}} a baroque pop ballad, Madonna uses a {{contrast}} of timbre, her higher smoother voice with her lower one. The song begins {{with the sound of}} violins for about 20seconds. After this, a drum machine, string arrangement and piano ushers on top of the violins, as Madonna sings the chorus line [...] "You can't hurt me <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> away from you, I never thought I would." [...] The violins and the drum beats drop after the chorus, but come back again during the next bridge. As Madonna sings the verse [...] "Oh father I have sinned", the violins change their pitch to a higher one. After the second chorus, there is an instrumental break where she sings about the realization that her father did not want to hurt her but she still ran away. The song ends with the guitar and violins fading out with Madonna's voice. In an interview with Paul Zollo, Madonna commented that the [...] "Father" [...] can refer to Tony, God or all the [...] "authorities in her life".|$|E
2500|$|During {{their third}} period, {{beginning}} in the 1970s, Sun Ra and the Arkestra settled down into a relatively conventional sound, often incorporating swing standards, although their records and concerts were still highly eclectic and energetic, and typically included at least one lengthy, semi-improvised percussion jam. Sun Ra was explicitly asserting a continuity with the ignored jazz tradition: [...] "They tried to fool you, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to school you, about jazz, all about jazz" [...] he rapped, framing the inclusion of pieces by Fletcher Henderson and Jelly Roll Morton.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Jenny Harrison was named as a [...] "favourite" [...] to Shortland Street viewers. Harper herself {{did not enjoy}} playing Jenny when the soap began, but influenced the characters development with her own personality, she stated, [...] "At first, I thought Jenny {{was a bit of}} a victim [...] They've made her a stronger character <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> sick of her being so passive. It was annoying to play and I don't think she was a good role model, either." [...] Jenny's abortion in 1995 was seen as highly controversial and several complaints were made to the Broadcasting Standards Authority, though none were upheld. A storyline featuring Jenny developing a cyst was introduced to the soap but never continued due to the writers effectively forgetting about it. This later became a codename, [...] "Jenny's cyst", for forgotten or misplaced storylines occurring in the soap. 2011 advertisements for repeats of the soap's original episodes, noted Jenny as one of the featured characters to entice an audience.|$|E

6000|$|The captain went on angrily. [...] "If you'd {{spoke up}} in time, may be I might 'a' let you go. I don't {{want to do}} a man any harm if I can't do him some good. Next time, if you've got a tongue in your head, use it. I can't do {{anything}} for you <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to commit you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look at that, now! I {{might have}} {{expected}} it, letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him. So <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to go and trapse {{all the way down}} the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that creetur's up to THIS time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any answer out of you about it." ...|$|E

You talk about theory an' fact. Ten cents higher than top price is a theory to Saxon an' me.

60|$|We {{had only}} one check to our pleasure, and that {{happened}} a little while before I took my leave, when, Miss Mills chancing to make some allusion to tomorrow morning, I unluckily let out that, being obliged to exert myself <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up at five o'clock. Whether Dora had any idea that I was a Private Watchman, I am unable to say; but it made a great impression on her, and she neither played nor sang any more.|$|E
6000|$|... "I parted {{with most}} of my {{merchandise}} at normal price as I hurried home. I did not dare to give it away, or even lose it, lest I should incur suspicion. My burden was far too precious to be risked by any foolishness <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> on {{as fast as it}} is possible to travel in such countries; and arrived in London with only the lamps and certain portable curios and papyri which I had picked up on my travels.|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a {{great many}} letters in answer to these Post-Prandials as they {{originally}} came out--some of them, strange to say, not wholly complimentary. As a rule, I am too busy a man to answer letters: and I take this opportunity of apologising to correspondents who write to tell me I am a knave or a fool, for not having acknowledged direct their courteous communications. But this friendly criticism seems {{to call for a}} reply, because it involves a question of principle which I have often noted in all discussions of Utopias and Millennia.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My own fault. Yes;--I don't doubt that. I {{know it was}} my own fault, my dear, to {{have had}} {{anything}} to do with it. And <b>now</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> to pay for it.' ...|$|R

60|$|It was {{the reply}} I had asked for; {{but it was}} not {{explicit}} enough, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> it, to satisfy me. I felt the necessity of leading him (if possible) into details.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I {{reach in}} my pocket for the {{abstract}} of title; but I suddenly hear my team running away. I run {{to the window and}} emit the word--or exclamation, which-ever it may be--viz, 'Whoa!' Then I rush down-stairs and down the street, returning in a few minutes. 'Dang them mules,' I says; 'they done run away and busted the doubletree and two traces. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to hoof it home, for I never brought no money along. Reckon we'll talk about that loan some other time, gen'lemen.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; it's {{the fellows}} like you that scare me," [...] {{retorted}} the clothing merchant. [...] "Ev'ry time you curse the war you're keeping us from {{winning the war}} as quick as we ought to; you're tripping the soldiers, the government, the President--the whole machine. I'll admit I don't like the war, but I'm for it, just the same. Can you figure that out, Abe Kauffman? Once I had more sense than you have, but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{a better way of}} thinking. It ain't for me to say whether the war's right or not; my country's honor is at stake, so I'll back my country to the last ditch." ...|$|E
60|$|That morning I {{was summoned}} to see the Prince Joshua and dress his wounds, which, {{although}} not of a serious nature, were very painful. The moment that I entered the man's presence I noticed a change in his face. Like {{the rest of us}} I had always set this fellow down as a mere poltroon and windbag, a blower of his own trumpet, as Oliver had called him. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> an insight into his real nature which showed me that although he might be these things and worse, he was also a very determined and dangerous person, animated by ambitions which he meant to satisfy at all hazards.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's at Framley <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> know. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{a letter}} only {{yesterday}} from his wife, with a commission. He was there, and Lord Lufton had just left." ...|$|R
6000|$|Wild. This lady Fatima pleases me most infinitely: <b>Now</b> am <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{among the}} Hamets, the Zegrys, and the Bencerrages. Hey, what work will the Wildbloods make among the Cids and the Bens of the Arabians? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're all right, <b>now!</b> <b>I</b> reckon we've <b>got</b> the Commodore this time. <b>I</b> judge I've <b>got</b> {{the stuff}} here that'll take the tuck out of him." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{these things}} I saw, albeit dimly and blurred with tears; but I could bear no more. I {{continued}} in my place, but what I shall deliver to you <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> by others' eyes and others' mouths. Tragic sounds there were that pierced my ears and wounded my heart as I sat there, {{but it is}} as I tell you: the latest image recorded by my eyes in that desolating hour was Joan of Arc with the grace of her comely youth still unmarred; and that image, untouched by time or decay, has remained with me all my days. Now I will go on.|$|E
60|$|Oh, my poor darling! my {{innocent}} martyr! I {{understood it}} at last. The false name {{in which he}} had married me; the terrible words he had spoken when he had warned me to respect his secret; the still more terrible doubt that he felt of me at that moment--it was all intelligible to my sympathies, it was all clear to my understanding, <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up again from the sofa, strong in a daring resolution which the Scotch Verdict had suddenly kindled in me--a resolution at once too sacred and too desperate to be confided, in the first instance, to any other than my husband's ear.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{a regular}} runt before I begun," [...] he said, [...] "and look at me <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it from Peg Bowen. She's a witch, you know. I wouldn't go near her again for a bushel of magic seed. It was an awful experience. I haven't much left, but I guess I've enough to do me till I'm as tall as I want to be. You must take a pinch of the seed every three hours, walking backward, and you must never tell a soul you're taking it, or it won't work. I wouldn't spare any of it to any one but you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] quoth Hereward, laughing. [...] "Do not tempt me {{by being}} too grateful. It {{is hard enough}} to gather honey, like the bees, for other folks to eat. What if I kept you myself, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None in the least. I {{have had}} intentions, {{and they have}} failed;--from want of that support which I {{had a right to}} expect. I have {{struggled}} and I have failed, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> no intentions. What are yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Music has charms {{to soothe}} a savage breast,'" [...] quoted Peter, who {{was getting into}} the habit of adorning his {{conversation}} with similar gems.
