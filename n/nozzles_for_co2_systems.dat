As the charge of CO2 to the air conditioning systems is very small (200-400 g) there is no realistic danger for the passengers, even in case of accidental release.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{thermodynamic}} {{models for}} fitting the phase equilibrium of binary systems were applied, aiming {{to predict the}} high pressure phase equilibrium of multicomponent systems {{of interest in the}} food engineering field, comparing the results generated by the models with new experimental data and with those from the literature. Two mixing rules were used with the Peng-Robinson equation of state, one with the mixing rule of van der Waals and the other with the composition-dependent mixing rule of Mathias et al. The systems chosen are of fundamental importance in food industries, such as the binary <b>systems</b> <b>CO(2)</b> -limonene, CO(2) -citral and CO(2) -linalool, and the ternary <b>systems</b> <b>CO(2)</b> -Limonene-Citral and CO(2) -Limonene-Linalool, where high pressure phase equilibrium knowledge is important to extract and fractionate citrus fruit essential oils. <b>For</b> the <b>CO(2)</b> -limonene <b>system,</b> some experimental data were also measured in this work. The results showed the high capability of the model using the composition-dependent mixing rule to model the phase equilibrium behavior of these systems.

In this work, a CaO sorbent produced by template synthesis was studied as a sorbent <b>for</b> a <b>CO₂</b> looping <b>system</b> under RF heating which offers short start-up times, highly controlled operation, high degree of robustness and low price. The sorbent reached its stable CO₂ capacity of 15. 4 wt. % already after 10 temperature cycles (650 / 850 °C) under RF heating. Higher CO₂ desorption rate and lower degree of the sorbent sintering was observed under RF heating as compared to conventional heating...|$|R

50|$|Frequently, porous {{adsorbents}} {{with large}} surface areas, but only weak adsorption sites, lack sufficient capacity <b>for</b> <b>CO2</b> under realistic conditions. To increase low pressure CO2 adsorption capacity, adding amine functional groups to highly porous materials {{has been reported}} to result in new adsorbents with higher capacities. This strategy has been analyzed for polymers, silicas, activated carbons and metal-organic frameworks. Amine impregnated solids utilize the well-established acid-base chemistry of CO2 with amines, but dilute the amines by containing them within the pores of solids rather than as H2O solutions. Amine impregnated solids are reported to maintain their adsorption capacity and selectivity under humid test conditions better than alternatives. For example, a 2015 study of 15 solid adsorbent candidates <b>for</b> <b>CO2</b> capture found that under multicomponent equilibrium adsorption conditions simulating humid flue gas, only adsorbents functionalized with alkylamines retained a significant capacity <b>for</b> <b>CO2.</b>|$|R

50|$|Maximum {{catalytic}} {{current density}} <b>for</b> <b>CO2</b> reduction {{that can be}} achieved in aqueous media is only 10 mA cm−2 based solubility of CO2 and diffusion limitations. The integrated maximum photocurrent under Air Mass 1.5 illumination, in the conventional Shockley-Quiesser limit for solar energy conversion for p-Si (1.12 eV), p-InP (1.3 eV), p-GaAs (1.4 eV), and p-GaP (2.3 eV) are 44.0 mA cm&minus;2, 37.0 mA cm&minus;2, 32.5 mA cm&minus;2 and 9.0 mA cm&minus;2, respectively. Therefore, non-aqueous media such as DMF, acetonitrile, methanol are explored as solvent <b>for</b> <b>CO2</b> electrochemical reduction. In addition, Methanol has been industrially used as a physical absorber of CO2 in the Rectisol method. Similarly to aqueous media system, p-Si, p-InP, p-GaAs, p-GaP and p-CdTe are explored <b>for</b> <b>CO2</b> photoelectrochemical reduction. Among these, p-GaP has lowest overpotential, whereas, p-CdTe has moderate overpotential but high catalytic current density in DMF with 5% water mixture system. Main product of CO2 reduction in non-aqueous media is carbon monoxide. Competitive hydrogen generation is minimized in non-aqueous media. Proposed mechanism <b>for</b> <b>CO2</b> reduction to CO in non-aqueous media involves single electron reduction of CO2 to CO2●− radical anion and adsorption of radical anion to surface followed by disproportionate reaction between unreduced CO2 and CO2●− radical anion to form CO32− and CO.|$|R
