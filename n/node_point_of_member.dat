40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the shape control of composite material plates using piezoelectric actuators. A finite element formulation is developed for modeling a laminated composite plate that has piezoelectric actuators and sensors. To improve {{the accuracy of}} the prediction of the plate deformation, a simple higher-order deformation theory is used.

For the shape control, an optimization algorithm, based on finite element techniques, is developed to determine optimal actuator voltages to minimize the surface error between the desired shape and actual deformed shape. The error function for a plate element is determined by calculating the mean square of the surface error over the surface, instead of determining it only at the <b>node</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> the element.

Also, by texture mapping the covered pixels into the current frame of the video clip we can generate a dynamic mosaic of the object.
