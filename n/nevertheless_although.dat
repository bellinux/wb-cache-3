5|$|The {{work of the}} CNSA {{during the}} war was {{considered}} extremely successful by contemporaries and modern historians alike. By providing a network of food distribution, the CNSA and CRB managed to avoid a major famine in Belgium during the occupation. <b>Nevertheless,</b> <b>although</b> the CRB and CNSA {{were part of the}} same network, the CRB criticized the CNSA, holding it responsible for occasional thefts of food by the Germans and for providing inadequate security for the shipments. The Belgian arm, however, felt under undue pressure from the CRB. In 1916, Francqui even petitioned the British to allow the CNSA to take full charge of the international network away from the CRB, although this appeal was dismissed because of the precarious position CNSA held within the occupied country. Nevertheless, relations between the two bodies remained generally good.|$|E

5|$|Cabral {{was later}} passed over, {{possibly}} {{as a result}} of a quarrel with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional. The first question has been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. <b>Nevertheless,</b> <b>although</b> he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, Cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the Age of Discovery.|$|E

With this new entourage, he continued to perform at a number of local venues including Jewel's Catch One, a predominantly black gay dance club on West Pico Avenue in Los Angeles, but reviewers were unimpressed with the new line-up, most of whom abandoned Sylvester in December 1974. After a brief sojourn in England, Sylvester returned to San Francisco and assembled three young drag queens to be backing singers: Arnold Elzie, Leroy Davis, and Gerry Kirby. <b>Nevertheless,</b> <b>although</b> he performed at such events as the 1975 Castro Street Fair, success continued to elude him, and he eventually fired Elzie, Davis, and Kirby.|$|E

It was beset by financial problems and its preparations were hurried. Its ship, Nimrod, {{was less than}} half of the size of Robert Falcon Scott's 1901–04 expedition ship Discovery, and Shackleton's crew lacked relevant experience. Controversy arose from Shackleton's decision to base the expedition in McMurdo Sound, close to Scott's old headquarters, in contravention of a promise to Scott that he would not do so. <b>Nevertheless,</b> <b>although</b> the expedition's profile was initially much lower than that of Scott's six years earlier, its achievements attracted nationwide interest and made Shackleton a public hero. The scientific team, which included the future Australasian Antarctic Expedition leader Douglas Mawson, carried out extensive geological, zoological and meteorological work. Shackleton's transport arrangements, based on Manchurian ponies, motor traction, and sled dogs, were innovations which, despite limited success, were later copied by Scott for his ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition.|$|E

Starting in June 2002, a Dutch manufacturing firm held a monthly lottery for workers who had taken no sick leave in the previous three months and had not previously won the lottery. In a given lottery, each of seven contestants whose names were randomly drawn received 75 Euros. The authors find statistically significant differences in absence patterns across groups of workers with different eligibility statuses depending on their attendance records and whether they had previously won. One finding is that absenteeism rose among workers who, having won already, were ineligible for further participation. <b>Nevertheless,</b> and <b>although</b> the reduction in firm-wide absence associated with the lottery drifted from 2. 4 percentage points to 1. 1 percentage points after seven months, the authors conclude that the lottery was of net benefit to the firm...|$|R

The Carrier Corporation moved its headquarters out of Syracuse, relocated its manufacturing operations out of state, and outsourced some of its production to Asian facilities. <b>Nevertheless,</b> <b>although</b> city population has declined since 1950, the Syracuse metropolitan area population has remained fairly stable, even growing by 2.5 percent since 1970.

40|$|The {{membrane}} {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) virions contains high levels of cholesterol and sphingomyelin, an enrichment that is explained by the preferential budding of the virus through raft microdomains of the plasma membrane. Upon depletion of cholesterol from HIV- 1 virions with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, infectivity was almost completely abolished. In contrast, this treatment had only a mild effect on the infectiousness of particles pseudotyped with the G envelope of vesicular stomatitis virus. The cholesterol-chelating compound nystatin had a similar effect. Cholesterol-depleted HIV- 1 virions exhibited wild-type patterns of viral proteins and contained normal levels of cyclophilin A and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. <b>Nevertheless,</b> and <b>although</b> they could still bind target cells, these virions were markedly defective for internalization.

25|$|Pat Garrett, smarting {{from local}} outrage over his {{shooting}} of the Kid, wanted {{to present his}} side of the story and hoped to turn a profit as well on the American public's fascination with the notorious outlaw. Consequently, he published his account of Bonney's life, The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid, in 1882. It was credited to Garrett, but the first fifteen chapters were a concoction of factual material mixed with fabrications, written by Roswell's postmaster, Ash Upson, an itinerant journalist. The remaining chapters, written in a more restrained style, are generally accurate, and were likely composed by Garrett himself. The book failed to find a wide audience and sold just a few copies; <b>nevertheless,</b> <b>although</b> filled with many errors of fact, The Authentic Life served afterwards as the main source for most books written about the Kid until the 1960s.

25|$|Some sources {{consider}} Angaturama {{a synonym}} of Irritator, citing {{the fact that}} the remains of Angaturama allegedly seem to complete Irritators skull (meaning that they could belong to the same specimen). However, substantial objection has been raised to this assertion. Kellner and Campos (2000) and Machado and Kellner (2005) both expressed the opinion that the fossils come from two different genera, and that the fossil of Angaturama was clearly more laterally flattened than Irritator. A review of both fossils by Sales and Schultz (2017) also noted that the specimens differ in other aspects of their preservation: the Irritator specimen is brighter in color; the Irritator speicmen is affected by a vertical crack while the Angaturama specimen bears many cavities; and the damage to the teeth of the Irritator specimen is much less severe. They also identified a possible point of overlap, the third left maxillary tooth, and observed that the skull of Angaturama may have been larger than that of Irritator based on the proportions of Baryonyx. <b>Nevertheless,</b> <b>although</b> the two specimens evidently do not belong to the same individual, Sales and Schultz noted that synonymy at the genus level would need to be verified by more extensively overlapping remains. If Angaturama and Irritator are actually regarded {{as a member of the}} same genus, Irritator challengeri would be the valid scientific name under rules of priority.|$|E

Our results confirm both dynamic and static theoretical equivalence of auctioning and grandfathering.
