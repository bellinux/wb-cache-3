Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit {{suggested}} in dicta that the defenses available to foreign manufacturers in infringement actions under 35 U. S. C. § 271 (g) in Federal district courts {{do not apply}} to exclusion actions before the International Trade Commission. This iBrief argues that this decision is problematic for three reasons: (1) the Federal Circuit’s decision is inconsistent with the ITC’s longstanding tradition of consulting the patent statute when adjudicating exclusion actions under 19 U. S. C. § 1337, (2) the court’s suggestion that the ITC should be given broad discretion to resolve conflicts between the patent statute and the Tariff Act is at odds with the Chevron doctrine, and (3) if the ITC employs the broad discretion that Kinik confers to it by excluding more foreign art than Federal district courts could lawfully exclude under the patent statute, the enforcement of domestic patent policy in the United States could conceivably violate obligations of <b>non-discrimination</b> (<b>Article</b> 27. 1) and burden-shifting (Article 34) imposed by the TRIPS Agreement...|$|E
40|$|The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 brings {{together}} aspects of family, {{child care and}} adoption law that affect children. The Act deliberately seeks to incorporate the 3 key principles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) - i. e. <b>non-discrimination</b> (<b>Article</b> 2); a child's welfare as a primary consideration (Article 3); and listening to children's views (Article 12) - into Scottish legislation and practice. This 'mapping paper' undertakes {{a detailed analysis of}} the Act, and accompanying regulations and guidance, asking the following questions: In relation to which decisions do the views of children need to be sought? Which children are included in any such requirements? What processes are specified for ascertaining children's views? What weight is given to the child's views? Is provision made for feedback to the child? Relevant reported case law is considered. The mapping paper is part of a feasibility study, funded by the Scottish Executive. The feasibility study sought to examine how best to conceptualise and evaluate how decision-making in children's lives takes due account of their views, with particular attention to processes related to Part I of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 and the implications for compliance with the UNCRC.

40|$|MCom (South African and International Tax), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Base erosion in {{the form}} of profit {{shifting}} has become an increasing concern internationally as well as in South Africa. A significant type of base erosion in South Africa is {{in the form}} of excessive interest deductions where income is effectively shifted to a no-tax or low-tax jurisdiction. One of the key developments affecting the South African tax laws was the introduction of provisions that target base erosion and profit shifting. Included in these provisions is section 23 M, which limits the deduction of interest paid to persons in whose hands the interest received is not subject to tax in South Africa. It was, however, identified that section 23 M may target the same interest risks that the new section 31 thin capitalisation provisions address. Section 23 M was said to be the enactment of thin capitalisation. Although one of the purposes of tax treaties is to encourage international trade and investment, there is also discriminatory taxation, which runs counter to that purpose and therefore the prevention of such discrimination is important when dealing with tax treaties. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Model Tax Convention contains a handful of special criteria in article 24, which must not lead to different or less favourable treatment with regard to taxation. It was found that the <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>article,</b> in particular articles 24 (4) and 24 (5), may prevent the application of a thin capitalisation regime if the provisions are in contrast with the OECD non-discrimination provisions. Article 24 (4) and article 24 (5), however, contain an exception that the non-discrimination provisions would not be applicable provided that the thin capitalisation regimes are compatible with the arm’s length principles of article 9. If section 23 M was therefore found to be an arm’s length transaction, the article 24 (4) and (5) non-discrimination provisions would without further consideration, not be applicable. It was, however, found that section 23 M does not consider the factors that should be considered when an arm’s length transaction is applicable, but merely applies the same formula to each company regardless of the size of the company or the industry sector. As a result of this, it appears as if section 23 M is arbitrary in nature and therefore would not represent an arm’s length transaction. The exception would not be applicable and would therefore increase the potential non-compliance with the non-discrimination provision. The objective of this study was to determine whether any aspect of section 23 M would be contrary to the OECD guidelines relevant to thin capitalisation and in particular the non-discrimination provisions. It was, however, found that although it appears as if section 23 M’s primary focus is on cross-border transactions, the provisions do not directly discriminate on the basis of residence. As a result of the discrimination being indirect discrimination and the fact that the cause of section 23 M being applicable is not foreign ownership, but rather due to the creditor not being subject to tax, it was concluded that the OECD non-discrimination provisions would not be applicable to section 23 M.

40|$|Topic: The {{study is}} linked to the concept of a group of companies. A group {{is at the same time}} a legal and {{economical}} phenomenon. An international group of companies consists of companies and permanent establishments located in different states. The study covers not only subsidiaries to be consolidated to the group financial statement, but also associated enterprises where the group’s ownership can be below 50 % and which will not, therefore, be consolidated. Such associated enterprises which do not belong to the group under accounting and company laws can have a firm connection to the group. Regarding taxation, attention will be paid to the conditions and terms concluded inside the group. Adjustments can also become a factor in relation associated enterprises which are not consolidated if the conditions and terms concluded deviate from what would have been agreed on at the open market. The main goal of the thesis is to find out how international regulation created within the OECD and EU harmonises the taxation of interest payments between associated enterprises. The study consists of the levels of tax treaty law, European Community law and domestic tax law. From these three levels, the focus is on European Community law or in a wider context on the European Union. The main research methods are legal dogmatic and comparative law. The comparative part of the study focuses on the tax systems of the United States of America, Germany, Estonia and Finland. The macro level comparison covers not only domestic international laws, tax treaties, case law and other official documents, but also customary methods of interpretation, ways of transposing international agreements into the national legal order and carrying out international law obligations in the respective countries. These countries have been chosen from the Finnish point-of-view. The United States was a significant capital exporting country before the current economical recession. The U. S. tax treaty policy and domestic international tax laws have had a great impact on other countries’ tax systems. Economically, Germany is the most powerful country in the EU. Relatively speaking, most of the preliminary references referred to the European Court of Justice dealing with direct income tax law are made by German courts. Estonia is interesting from the Finnish perspective due to geographical reasons and tax competition. The study also covers the Swedish tax system quite deeply. Sweden was not included in the macro level comparison because group taxation systems are similar in Finland and Sweden. The two countries also joined the EU at the same time. Micro level comparison, which examines specific legal institutions, was carried out with Belgium, Denmark, France, India, Mexico and the Netherlands as examples. Structure The study has ten chapters. Chapter 1 describes the goals, methodology, limitations and sources of the thesis. Chapter 2 presents principles and goals which affect interpretation of tax law. The principles of legality and equality may be legally enforced, whereas ability to pay, neutrality and fairness are goals for the improvement of the society’s social feature. Chapter 2 first discusses the sources of international taxation from international law and treaties before and moving on to international tax law and its interpretation. European tax law is studied from a critical perspective. The impact of acquis communautaire on national tax systems has been compared to a jack-in-the-box which lowers the predictability of tax assessment. Chapter 3 deals with the history of direct tax harmonisation and the current possibilities to cross-border loss-relief. The European Commission’s initiatives for group taxation - Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base and Home State Taxation - are discussed. Thin capitalisation and transfer pricing problems would be eliminated if these initiatives were adopted. Companies taking part into unitary taxation would be fiscally consolidated at a group level. Corporate tax harmonisation could go further than this in theory. An EU tax would eliminate the current constitutional problems. The EU tax would create a direct tax link between the EU and its citizens. The EU’s political accountability would be improved if the European Parliament’s involvement in the adoption of tax laws was increased. Chapter 4 presents group financing from a taxation point-of-view. Debt financing may provide tax benefits in cross-border situations. Interest payments are usually deductible expenses, whereas dividend paid to a foreign parent company may usually not be deducted out of company profits. The differential tax treatment of debt and equity may imply tax-planning opportunities for group financing. Groups of companies may strive to allocate group financing companies into low-tax jurisdictions where the general tax rate is low, and extend intercompany loans into high-tax jurisdictions where the benefit of a tax deduction is high. Equity investments also provide tax-planning opportunities. The international tax treaty network and the Parent-Subsidiary Directive eliminate taxation at source from intra-group dividends as well. Chapter 5 examines the concept of an associated enterprise. The concept of an associated enterprise is defined differently in the OECD Model Tax Convention and the Interest and Royalties Directive. International accounting standards and domestic accounting and tax laws also define the concept using their own criteria. A company belonging to a group of companies may, in practice, be an associated company under accounting laws but fall outside the scope of the Interest and Royalties Directive. Chapters 6 - 9 deal with the concept of interest, taxation principles, interest deductions and transfer pricing issues dealing with interest and financing. Interest is commonly considered to be return on debt capital. The concept of interest has not been defined in the Finnish Income Tax Act or Business Income Tax Act. The Act on Taxation of Income of a Person Subject to Limited Tax Liability contains a definition of interest which is applied between associated companies located in different EU member states. Interest, according to the Act, means any income from debt-claims whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits. The legal concept of interest is generally equal to the economic concept of interest. Return on zero-coupon bonds and perpetual loans are considered to be interest. The amount of interest is determined by percentage of interest, time and debt. Debt is characterized by the debtor-creditor relationship and the absence of participation rights. Finnish tax law does not explicitly rule how to draw a line between debt and equity. The classification of hybrid instruments under civil law is generally a starting-point. The classification is also based on case law. The economic substance of an instrument can be considered. There are no published cases where hybrid equity would have been reclassified as debt for tax purposes. Debt has been reclassified as equity only in a few cases. According to the Commentary to the OECD Model Tax Convention, interest generally means remuneration on money lent, being remuneration coming within the category of “income form movable capital”. Article 11 OECD states that interest means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits and income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, in particular. There is an interconnection between interest and dividends in the Articles of the OECD Model Tax Convention. Interest on participating bonds should normally not be considered as a dividend; also, interest on convertible bonds should not be considered as a dividend before the bonds are actually converted as shares. It may be difficult to make a distinction between interest and dividend in situations of thin capitalisation. If the repayment of loan largely depends on the success of an enterprise, interest paid on such loans may be taxed as a dividend. The Contracting States may widen Article 11 OECD as to include any income which is taxed as interest under their domestic laws. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines require that the arm’s principle shall be followed in group financing. The arm’s length principle requires that associated enterprises shall apply market based interest rate and other financing terms to their internal debts and receivables. The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines do not, however, indicate how an arm’s length interest rate should be determined. The comparable uncontrolled price method is usually the preferred method for determining an arm’s length interest rate. It can be challenging to find loan agreements which would be sufficiently close comparables as to type, quality and quantity with an intercompany loan. The cost plus method has also been suggested as a suitable method for evaluating a current interest rate. With regard to comparables, an internal uncontrolled comparable would be preferred. External comparables will nevertheless be used in many cases. Group interest rates can be compared with market interest rates or a simulated credit rating can be carried out. Chapter 10 concludes the thesis and discusses future scenarios on interest deductions in Finland. Finland does not have statutory thin capitalisation rules. The Finnish approach is liberal toward thin capitalisation. The tax authorities evaluate a company’s financing structure as a whole. Attention will be paid to the company’s debt to equity ratio and whether interest is paid in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Debt push-down structures have been widely used. Highly-leveraged financing structures have been subject to tax audits. It is fairly common to declare that debt to equity ratio 15 : 1 is accepted in Finland. This debt to equity ratio was accepted by the Supreme Administrative Court in KHO 1999 : 19. A clear rule should not be drawn only from one judgment. Published case-law of the Supreme Administrative Court dealing with thin capitalisation is limited. Many of the cases have been decided on the basis of a double taxation treaty. A qualified <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>article</b> following Article 24 (4) of OECD Model Tax Convention has prevented a denial of deductibility of interest. The EC Treaty Freedoms also require equal treatment of domestic and cross-border situations. Landmark cases dealing with thin capitalisation are cases C- 324 / 00 Lankhorst-Hohorst, C- 524 / 04 Thin Cap Group Litigation and C- 105 / 07 N. V. Lammers. The ECJ has found that the discriminatory application of thin capitalisation provisions involving a fixed debt to equity ratio constitutes a disproportionate restriction of the freedom of establishment. Domestic anti-abuse measures which categorically prevent taxpayers from exercising their right to free movement are not allowed unless domestic legislation has a “specific purpose of preventing wholly artificial arrangements”. Interest deductions in Finland de lege ferenda The Finnish Ministry of Finance published a study in April 2009 dealing with interest deductions in corporate income taxation. The study covers the current legal status in Finland, development in various European countries and the impact of European Community law and double taxation treaties on interest deductions. The aim is to discover whether deductibility of interest payments should be limited in Finland and, if so, what kind of measures should be taken. Organisations representing Finnish industry and Trade, the Tax Administration, the Finnish Bank and tax law professors were requested to answer whether limitations on interest deductions should be introduced in Finland and, if so, what the limitations should be. The deadline was in June 2009. Due to the economic recession, it is likely that restrictions on interest deductions, if they are considered necessary, will not be introduced in the near future. The Finnish corporate tax system should be reviewed as a whole before deciding whether limitations on interest deductions should be introduced. The liberal approach toward interest deductions and thin capitalisation provide companies with a competitive advantage. If the companies’ right to make interest deductions is limited, it should also be considered whether the general corporate tax rate of 26 % should be lowered. The future of the Finnish group contribution system, where a profit-making group company may transfer taxable profit to a loss-making group company, should be reviewed in the same context. The Ministry of Finance has already indicated that Finland may transfer to a fiscal consolidation system. Taking into account the current economic situation, there is a risk that tighter interest deduction rules may create unnecessary obstacles for corporate financing. On the other hand, the protection of the Finnish corporate tax base may call for limitations on interest deductions. Statutory interest deduction rules would provide legal certainty for both the taxpayer and the tax administration. The U. S. interest-stripping rules, the German Zinsschranke and Swedish limitations on related parties’ interest deductions serve as examples for possible limitations on interest deductions. In addition, the Belgian notional interest deduction and the Dutch initiatives on defiscalisation of interest income and deductions in group taxation and a mandatory interest-box should also be considered as well. Introducing a tax incentive would stimulate investments, whereas limitations on interest deductions would probably diminish Finland’s attractiveness from an investor point-of-view. Mitkä ovat kansainvälisten konsernien verosuunnittelumahdollisuudet sisäisissä siirroissa? Kansainvälisen konsernin verotuksen tasoon voidaan vaikuttaa valitsemalla sisäisiin siirtoihin lievästi verotettava tulotyyppi. Verosopimusten mukaiset korkotulon nollaverokannat voivat alentaa konsernin efektiivistä veroastetta. Verosuunnittelu voi johtaa tilanteeseen, jossa käytetyn tulotyypin muoto ei vastaa tulon taloudellista luonnetta.

Etujärjestöt ja julkishallinto ovat antaneet valtiovarainministeriölle lausuntoja, joissa on sekä vastustettu että puollettu koron vähennysoikeuden rajoittamista. Lisäksi tarkastellaan markkinaehtoisen koron määrittämistä siirtohinnoittelussa. Denna avhandling gäller beskattning av interna räntebetalningar mellan närstående bolag belägna i olika stater. Avhandlingen är en rättsdogmatisk studie med komparativt inslag från USA, Tyskland, Estland och Finland. Även Sverige har behandlats relativt ingående. Andra länder har behandlats i anslutning till särskilda rättsfrågor. Rättsfall från cirka 10 länder har behandlats. Avhandlingen redogör för skillnaden mellan hard law och soft law. Flera metoder, såsom skattepolitik och planering, har tillämpats vid sidan av den rättsdogmatiska och komparativa metoden. Avhandlingen har lånat inslag från andra vetenskapsområden, som t. ex. bokföringen, IFRS, bolagsrätten, finansieringen, nationalekonomin och historia forskningen. Se Kristiina Äimä: Sisäiset korot lähiyhtiöiden kansainvälisessä verotuksessa. WSOY. Helsingfors 2009. Avhandlingen innehåller en engelsk resumé om 17 sidor. Temat behandlas ur ett internationellt skatterättsligt perspektiv. Begreppet närstående bolag är centralt för temat. Närstående bolag definieras på ett annorlunda sätt inom bokföring, bolagsrätt och skatterätt. Likaså är definitionerna av ränta olika i skatterätten och andra vetenskaper. Räntebegreppet undersöks ur skatteavtalsrättens, EG-skatterättens och nationella rättens perspektiv. Särskild vikt läggs vid avdragsrätten för räntebetalningar och fastställandet av en marknadsmässig ränta. Inom multinationella företagsgrupper förekommer det lån och förskott på betalningar på samma sätt som mellan oberoende bolag. Ett skuldförhållande kan utgöras av en kortfristig skuld, såsom kundfordring eller leverantörsskuld. Därtill kan kapital lånas ut långfristigt i kapitalplaceringssyfte. Likaså kan kapital lånas ut för att ställa arbetande kapital till ett närstående bolags förfogande. Beviljandet av ett närståendelån kan vara i strid med aktieägarnas likställighetsprincip. Detta har beaktats i bolagsrätten. I verksamhetsberättelsen till bokslutet skall separat uppges penninglån, säkerheter och ansvarsförbindelser till personer som står bolaget nära samt de huvudsakliga villkoren för dessa. Avhandlingen tangerar finansieringen av multinationella företagsgrupper ur beskattningens synvinkel. Det påstås allmänt att företagsfinansieringen påverkas av det faktum att investeringar som har finansierats med främmande kapital beskattas i de flesta stater lindigare än kapitalplaceringar. Enligt huvudregeln får en investerare göra avdrag för räntebetalningar medan utdelningar på kapitalplaceringar vanligtvis inte är avdragsgilla i beskattningen. De belgiska reglerna gällande fiktivt ränteavdrag på eget kapital avviker däremot från huvudregeln. OECD-medlemsländernas dubbelskattningsavtal och nationella lagstiftning befriar vanligtvis ränteinkomster från beskattning i betalarens källstat. Källskattefriheten leder till skatteeffektiva kapitalöverföringar inom multinationella företagsgrupper. Internationell skatteplanering drar nytta även av ränteavdragen. Skatteeffektiviteten kan vara icke önskvärd från en statsfiskal synpunkt. Inom EU finns det ytterligare reglering gällande interna räntebetalningar. Enligt EG:s ränte- och royaltydirektiv beskattas interna räntebetalningarna endast i mottagarens hemviststat. För övrigt har EG-domstolen tolkat EU:s grundfriheter i sin rättspraxis så att en medlemsstat skall bevilja avdragsrätten under samma förutsättningar i gränsöverskridande situationer som i inhemska situationer. En nationell bestämmelse som inskränker etableringsfriheten kan ändå vara motiverad när den särskilt avser fiktiva upplägg som iscensätts för att kringgå lagstiftningen. Kravet på lika skattebehandling har lett till att många medlemsstater har övergått från traditionell underkapitaliseringsreglering till ränteavdragsbegränsningar. De nya avdragsbegränsningarna kan vara bundna till en procentenhet av EBIT (eng. Earnings before Interest and Taxes) eller motsvarande siffra eller låntagarens nominella finansiering av affärsförmögenhet. Ett koncernbolag som hör till en europeisk företagsgrupp beskattas som om bolaget vore fristående. Detta förorsakar mångfaldig beskattning. Europeiska kommissionens initiativ att harmonisera koncernbeskattningen skulle eliminera förlustutjämnings-, underkapitaliserings- och interprissättningsproblemen inom europeiska företagsgrupper. Den senaste utvecklingen i Sverige har följts noggrant i Finland. Bland annat förekomsten av räntesnurror i företagsskatteplaneringen och Regeringsrättens dom i Industrivärlden-målet har diskuterats. Dessutom har de nya svenska ränteavdragsbegränsningarna som skall förhindra skatteplanering inom företagsgrupper väckt intresse. För tillfället utreder finansministeriet om avdragsrätten för räntebetalningar borde begränsas inom finsk näringsbeskattning. Ifall avdragsrätten begränsas används sannolikt de svenska begränsningarna som förebild för den finska nya regleringen. Avhandlingen behandlar fördelar och nackdelar som kunde uppkomma om begränsningar introducerades...|$|E

Thus, delaying the introduction of product patents in exempt technologies, notably pharmaceuticals, till 1 January 2005. Ostensibly, this gave it the opportunity to exploit changing circumstances to and emergent views on TRIPS-implementation; in particular exploring new interpretations to residual flexibility in TRIPS and any continuing legal ambiguity in TRIPS obligations. In terms of the latter, the Panel Report in Canada – Patent Protection of Pharmaceutical Products is pertinent in having exhibited rare reticence in stepping back from defining the principle of <b>non-discrimination</b> in <b>Article</b> 27 (1), TRIPS Agreement. While maintaining legal ambiguity, this reticence also provides space for law-making and regulatory diversity. The article reviews the three amendments to India’s Patent Act, 1970 and finds mixed use of residual flexibility and some evidence of efforts to explore legal ambiguity. Thus, despite a favourable climate to TRIPS implementation and an active transnational access to medicine campaign, legislators in India have demonstrated a degree of caution. The article concludes that this caution is best explained in terms of deepening ambivalence concerning intellectual property within the government and the changing economic interests of sections of Indian pharma...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the right to}} education for foreign inmates in Norwegian prisons, with a particular focus on the group of inmates who lack a residence permit in Norway and could be expelled once their sentence is served. The viewpoint of the Norwegian criminal justice policy is that all inmates {{should have the same}} right to education as other citizens and residents in Norway. For the group without residence permit, however, it seems not fully clear what that right to education should entail. National law only provides access to the education system for those with a residence permit. In addition, International law is not fully clear on the content of the right to education for inmates. On this background, the article clarifies the right to education for foreign inmates, as it follows from national and international law. It pays specific attention to the prison as a specific context for the provision of education, and explains how the right to education relates to the law of the execution of sentences. Drawing from the ethical considerations of the penal system, and from legal principles of <b>non-discrimination,</b> the <b>article</b> eventually concludes that all foreign inmates who serve sentences of certain duration must be ensured access to education on an equal basis with other prisoners. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{fact that}} {{heterosexual}} couples still cannot form civil partnerships after {{the introduction of}} gender-neutral marriage contravenes Articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950.

It dismisses the justifications espoused by executive and judicial authorities in recent litigation for the indefinite postponement of reform, namely the overestimated costs of legislative amendment, the subordination of the equality principle {{to the number of}} takers, and attempts to gauge social demand through post- 2014 statistics on gay partnerships. Finally, it provides arguments for removing discrimination by opening civil partnership to opposite-sex couples rather than abolishing it: obviating hardship for family units lawfully constituted abroad, ensuring privacy for individuals whose disclosure of civil status reveals sexual orientation, and fostering a pluralist, tolerant society, accommodating ideological objections to marriage...|$|R

At the same time, German law granted the same right to foreign performers only for their performances that had occurred in Germany.

Despite the fact that violating Article 2. 1 does not necessarily implicate Article 2. 2, international trade theorists questioned whether the Appellate Body purposely avoided finding any of the regulations more trade restrictive than necessary.

Although this reading of Article 2. 1 limits the regulatory authority of WTO Members, it successfully tests necessity and thus gives the TBT Agreement force, while also showing deference to regulatory sovereignty by functioning like an exception provision...|$|R
40|$|This article makes a {{contribution}} to current debates in human rightsbased approaches to lesbian and bisexual (LB) women’s health. With reference to concepts embodied in the Yogyakarta Principles, it is proposed {{that the right to}} health includes access to health information, participation, equity, equality and <b>non-discrimination.</b> Specifically, the <b>article</b> examines how LB women’s health can be considered as a health inequality and discusses international developments to reduce disparities. Drawing on qualitative data collected in an online survey, the article reports on sexual minority women’s experiences of health-care. Participants were recruited via a purposive sampling strategy; questionnaires were completed by 6490 respondents of whom 5909 met the study criteria of residence in the UK, sexual orientation and completing the survey once. Analysis revealed four broad themes: heteronormativity in health-care; improving attitudes among healthcare professionals; equality in access; raising awareness and informed communities. The accounts highlight the centrality of human rights principles: fairness, respect, equality, dignity and autonomy. The implications for healthcare policy and practice are discussed including ways to empower staff and service users with knowledge and skills and ensuring non-discrimination in health service deliver...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of non-discrimination constitutes a corner-stone in different fields of international economic law, notably international trade in goods and services as well as intellectual property and investment protection. While its basic rationale appears to be straightforward, {{the application of the}} different legal elements which constitute a non-discrimination obligation has proven to be most challenging. Adjudicating bodies have been applying different interpretations and standards with regard to the legal elements of ‘less favourable treatment', ‘likeness' and ‘regulatory purpose', which leads to a high fragmentation of the non-discrimination principle in international economic law. This article maps out the different theories for each of these elements on the examples of WTO law, NAFTA, bilateral investment treaties (BIT) and EU law and analyses how these theories affect the scope and liberalizing effect of the <b>non-discrimination</b> obligation. The <b>article</b> then attempts to develop a coherent factor-based application of non-discrimination rules suitable for all fields of international economic law. The article submits the theory that the elements of non-discrimination should not be applied as strict legal conditions which must be proven by a complainant, but as a range of factors which are weighed and balanced by the adjudicating bodie...|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} the {{approach}} was shown by {{the judgment of the}} European Court of Justice in the Puccini case, which covered facts arising before the directive entered force. The State of Hesse in Germany had staged the opera La Bohème by Puccini during the 1993/94 season at the Hessische Staatstheater Wiesbaden without the permission of the copyright holder. The opera was first published in Italy and Puccini died on 29 November 1924. At the time, Italy applied a copyright period of 56 years pma, so Italian protection had expired at the end of 1980: Germany, however, applied a 70 years pma period to works of German authors and the [...] "rule of the shorter term" [...] (Art. 7.8 Berne Convention) to foreign works. The Court ruled that the application of the rule of the shorter term between Member States was a breach of the principle of <b>non-discrimination</b> enshrined in <b>Article</b> 12 of the Treaty instituting the European Community: hence the work should have been protected in Germany even if it was no longer protected in Italy. Such cases should no longer arise with the implementation of the directive.|$|R
40|$|Non-refoulement is {{the central}} part of the {{protection}} of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. It is true that Article 1, a definition, is the passport to Convention refugee status and the expectation of naturalization. However, this affects only a fraction of the world's refugees. Non-refoulement, and the form of protection it brings, affects 10 - 15 million refugees. Although it is now recognized that non-refoulement has been reinforced by other human rights treaties, such as the Convention against Torture, (CAT), the full impact has not been grasped. <b>Non-discrimination</b> obligations from <b>Article</b> 26 of the 1966 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, (CCPR) can limit differentiations in the allocating of rights and benefits. A review of rights based refuge is timely because the content, what is enjoyed beyond the refuge itself, is highly variable and relates, in part, to ambiguities in key terms allocating rights in the Convention. However, the refugees involved may be persons protected from expulsion not only by the Convention, but also by the newer human rights treaties. So the content problems also relate to a lack of interpretation of human rights treaties as these apply to persons protected from expulsion. Throughout, this essay shows that authoritative interpretation of treaties is needed to make the promise of the rights based refuge a reality for refugees...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} of <b>non-discrimination</b> in <b>Article</b> 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) holds that its rights are equally applicable to ‘everyone’. Nevertheless, {{evidence from the}} national context suggests that {{access to health care}} for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants depends on their legal status and in particular, preventive health care is often inaccessible to them. This has led to several hitherto under-investigated questions concerning the right to health in this context: Does a right to preventive health care exist at the international level? If so, what individual rights and State obligations are involved in this right? How does the {{principle of}} non-discrimination relate to this right? Does this principle offer (additional) protection to asylum seekers and undocumented migrants in terms of a possible right to preventive health care? Method: The main issue is what the principle of nondiscrimination has to offer for the preventive health care of persons without a regular residence status. Based on an analysis of the non-binding, but authoritative, General Comments of the United Nations (UN) Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), the paper takes an exploratory style that goes beyond traditional legal analysis and investigates how the law should be interpreted in order to enhance its effectiveness and relevance. Results and Discussion: Strictly speaking, there is no explicit, binding right to preventive health care for asylum seekers or undocumented migrants in the ICESCR itself. 2 Nevertheless, implications {{can be found in the}} CESCR General Comments Number 14 and 20. 3 Particularly, if one takes into account how the law should be interpreted according to CESCR General Comment 14 (CESCR GC 14), there should be a right to preventive health care for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants. The exact content of such a right, however, is less clearly defined. Further, the principle of non-discrimination is not conclusive as to whether the right to health would apply equally to asylum seekers and/or undocumented migrants as it would to nationals. Conclusion: For non-discrimination to be truly unambiguous with regard to the preventive health care of asylum seekers and undocumented migrants, it would be necessary to strike out the ‘general welfare’ provision of CESCR General Comment 20 (CESCR GC 20) and to clearly state that the ‘other status’ criterion also entails ‘residence status’. In that sense, the principle of non-discrimination is, indeed, an empty promise and the right to preventive health care for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants seems to be much better protected under the CESCR GC 14 ’s non-discriminatory interpretation of the right to health itself...|$|R
40|$|This {{deliverable}} (9. 8) is {{an article}} {{submitted to the}} International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family (Oxford Journals) which analyses the notion of family in the EU and family reproductive rights {{in a group of}} EU member states with different legal, cultural and social backgrounds (Italy, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands, Croatia and Hungary). The article combines a sociological and legal approach and is based on a questionnaire completed by the partners involved in the task (see Annex I). The social and legal changes in the geographies of families in Member States encourage the European Union to reconsider its traditionally prudent approach to family law. Indeed, the free movement of people, an essential characteristic of European citizenship, requires legally established family statuses to be ‘portable’ abroad. Similarly, marriage and reproductive mobility arising from the variety of national regulations force domestic legislatures and courts to challenge the definitions of family found in domestic law and social policy {{in the name of the}} right to family life and the principle of <b>non-discrimination.</b> Thus, this <b>article</b> starts by discussing the various notions of family that emerge from national laws and social policies in six EU member states with different legal, cultural and social backgrounds (Italy, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands, Croatia and Hungary). It then delineates the role of Europe and the social and legal interactions between Member States in the construction of a definition of family. Finally, it concentrates on cross-border reproductive care, a case study that allows for shedding light on the convergences among countries, as well as the role of Europe as a supra-national institution and as a space in which family models circulate and spread. The main conclusion is that a multilevel analysis of the notion of family shows the circularity of interactions top-down and bottom-up between Europe and individual States, as well between society and law...|$|R
40|$|Trade {{disputes}} in which public policy regulation is challenged {{have been among}} the most difficult and controversial of those before the adjudicatory bodies of the WTO. They have showcased the crucial role of adjudication in achieving an appropriate balance between the sovereign autonomy of States to regulate to protect important societal values {{on the one hand and}} trade liberalization on the other. Nowhere is this more clearly apparent than in the line of case law by the WTO Appellate Body, interpreting the <b>non-discrimination</b> obligation in <b>Article</b> 2. 1 of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). Despite its limited mandate, the Appellate Body has shouldered its responsibility to give appropriate meaning to this badly drafted provision. Thereby it has averted the risk of unacceptable limitations on the regulatory autonomy of states. However, since in order to do so, the Appellate Body has had to read into this provision a flexibility not apparent in its wording, no negotiated criteria for its availability exist. Thus, to ameliorate the risk of abuse of this new flexibility, the Appellate Body has itself established some criteria limiting its use. This contribution examines these legal developments against the background of the limited mandate of the adjudicatory bodies of the WTO. After sketching the new legal framework for technical regulations resulting from the Appellate Body's case law on Article 2. 1, it illustrates the dangers of such case law driven solutions to legal problems. It does so by focusing on one of the criteria laid down by the Appellate Body for the availability of the flexibility it has carved out of Article 2. 1, namely the Appellate Body's exclusion of cases of de jure discrimination from the possibility to use this flexibility is examined to determine whether it has the potential to close the door to legitimate public policy regulation. A way forward is then proposed...|$|R
