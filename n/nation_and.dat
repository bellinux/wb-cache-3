40|$|Weight-gain and {{physical}} inactivity in pregnancy {{have important implications}} for First <b>Nations</b> <b>and</b> Métis women, populations that experience a disproportionate burden of poor health outcomes in pregnancy. Utilizing a postcolonial feminist theoretical lens in conjunction with a social determinants of health framework and tenets of cultural safety, the purpose of my doctoral research, which was written in the publishable paper format, was to address four questions: a) Are First Nations women marginalized through current physical activity pregnancy guidelines?; b) How do pregnant First <b>Nations</b> <b>and</b> Métis women understand weight-gain {{and physical}} activity during pregnancy?; c) What are the factors that influence excessive weight-gain during pregnancy in urban First <b>Nations</b> <b>and</b> Métis women?; and d) How can obesity prevention programs with pregnant First <b>Nations</b> <b>and</b> Métis women who live in urban centres be reflective of and sensitive to their cultural practices? To answer these questions, I conducted community-based qualitative research, which included 15 semi-structured interviews with key informants who are health/service providers for Aboriginal women in Ottawa and focus groups and semi-structured interviews with 25 pregnant/postpartum First <b>Nations</b> <b>and</b> Métis women. I also conducted two focus groups with both health/service providers and pregnant/postpartum women to determine what type of resource would benefit pregnant, urban First <b>Nations</b> <b>and</b> Métis women. Ultimately, I used this information to develop this resource. 	My research results revealed a complex interaction between the social determinants of health underlined by current manifestations of colonialism, which impact urban First <b>Nations</b> <b>and</b> Métis women’s physical activity and weight-gain during pregnancy. These findings emphasize the need for culturally safe physical activity and weight-gain resources for First <b>Nations</b> <b>and</b> Métis women during pregnancy. Ultimately, this study identified the importance of community consultation to develop culturally safe, community-driven, and useful health interventions for urban, pregnant First <b>Nations</b> <b>and</b> Métis women...|$|R
