5|$|Gale married Henrietta Roper, the {{daughter}} of Henry Roper of Cowling, Kent. She died in 1720. They had one son, Roger Henry Gale, {{who was born in}} 1710. Gale himself died on 25 June 1744 at his estates in Scruton, and was buried near the church there. There is no monument in the churchyard, as he stipulated in his will that he be buried in such a manner that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> exactly where he was buried.|$|E
25|$|A year later, Vito's son, Vito Jr., {{began to}} go through a rebellious phase in {{reaction}} to his father's murder and cruelty from his peers in light of his father's sexual orientation, entering the Goth subculture and performing various acts of vandalism. His mother, Marie, asked Tony Soprano for money so she could relocate her family to Maine, where <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> them or what happened to Vito. Tony asked Phil Leotardo to also intervene, because of his involvement in Vito's death. Both paid separate visits to Vito Jr. and told him to start acting more like an adult. Vito Jr. continued to act out and later defecated in a shower at school.|$|E
500|$|A doctor prescribes Prozac, a {{real life}} antidepressant, to Kyle for his {{apparent}} love for feces, which he describes as [...] "fecalphilia", a condition perhaps better known by the medical term coprophilia. Composer Philip Glass composes the avant-garde musical score for the non-denominational Christmas play. Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass; Parker, who was a music major in college, said, [...] "I really thought you could basically tell a third grader {{to sit down at}} a keyboard and mess around and sell it as a Philip Glass album, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> the difference." [...] The do-it-yourself kit in the live action commercial, in which families can make their own Mr. Hankey, is similar to the Mr. Potato Head toy set.|$|E

500|$|According to Sally Jenkins, in her Sports Illustrated {{article on}} Carlisle:To take {{advantage}} of the Indians' versatility Warner drew up a new offense... "the Carlisle formation," [...] but later it would be known as the single wing. It was predicated on one small move: Warner shifted a halfback out wide, to outflank the opposing tackle, forming something that looked like a wing. It opened up a world of possibilities. The Indians could line up as if to punt – and then throw. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> whether they were going to run, pass or kick. For added measure Warner taught his quarterbacks to sprint out a few yards to their left or their right, buying more time to throw. The rest of the players flooded downfield and knocked down any opponent who might be able to intercept or bat away the pass.|$|E
500|$|Increasing {{wind shear}} caused Paula to weaken to a Category1 {{hurricane}} late on October13. Satellite imagery and reconnaissance aircraft flights indicated that cloud pattern was disrupted and the mid- and low-level centers were becoming detached. [...] Shortly thereafter, the National Hurricane Center remarked {{about the size}} of Paula, stating that, [...] "a hurricane is crossing between the western tip of Cuba and eastern Yucatan...but without modern technology <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> it was there". Drifting north-northeastward ahead of a mid-latitude trough, Paula weakened to a tropical storm at 1200UTC on October14. Three hours later, the storm made landfall between Santa Lucía and Puerto Esperanza, in the Pinar del Río Province of Cuba, with winds of 65mph (100km/h). By 0600UTC on October15, Paula weakened to a tropical depression, while moving eastward over Cuba. Six hours later, the storm degenerated into a remnant low pressure area, before completely dissipating early on October16.|$|E
500|$|The show's animal trainer, Debbie Cove, used {{around three}} hundred {{cockroaches}} for this episode. Cove later noted {{that only one}} of the cockroaches died during the filming, due to old age. Director Kim Manners was very pleased with the way the cockroaches behaved, noting that [...] "every shot I wanted to get, they got." [...] Cast and crew members later recalled that Manners began giving orders to the roaches. Cinematographer John Bartley explained, [...] "when I saw Kim Manners talking to a bucket of cockroaches, that was a highlight for me." [...] Several [...] "incredibly detailed" [...] rubber cockroaches were created for the episode. These props were extremely detailed: prop master Ken Hawryliw explained that, [...] "you could put one next to a real roach and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> the difference." [...] In addition, the [...] "piles and piles" [...] of faux-dung were created for the show by using an organic, feces-free substance.|$|E

5000|$|On September 29, 2015, Republican Kevin McCarthy {{said the}} {{following}} during {{an appearance on}} Hannity: [...] "Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable.

500|$|Furious that Humbert tricked her, the Queen {{decides that}} first Snow White shall die {{by her own}} hand and at any cost. She goes down the dungeon to her secret room where she {{practices}} her dark magic, complete with a pet raven that [...] "knows all her secrets," [...] and in desperation uses her spellbook and cauldron to mix a potion that transforms her into a hag. Her beauty is shrouded in ugliness and age, though presumably reversible. She then conjures a poison apple, which will cause [...] "the Sleeping Death", and proceeds to leave the castle via a moat boat. She is sure that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> or perform the counter-curse to her spell, and believes the Dwarfs would bury her rival alive, thinking her dead. The Queen comes to the cottage, followed by two vicious vultures, and finds Snow White baking a pie for Grumpy the dwarf. Somehow Snow White's animal friends realize that the old hag is the Queen. After an unsuccessful attempt to warn Snow White by attacking the Queen, they go to warn the Dwarfs of the Queen's arrival. The Queen tricks the princess into letting her inside the cottage and eating the bewitched apple, telling her {{that it is a}} magic wishing apple. Snow White takes a bite and falls to the floor, apparently dead.|$|E
2500|$|... "How {{can anyone}} {{communicate}} {{the idea of}} color by means of words since the ear does not hear colors but only sounds?" [...] This quote, written by the Sicilian philosopher Gorgias, was used to show his theory that ‘there is nothing’, ‘if there were anything <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> it’, ‘and if anyone did know it, no one could communicate it’. This theory, thought of in the late 5th century BC, is still being contemplated by many philosophers throughout the world. This argument has led some to label Gorgias a nihilist (one who believes nothing exists, or {{that the world is}} incomprehensible, and that the concept of truth is fictitious).|$|E
2500|$|Specific {{individuals}} {{have been identified}} with Atari Democrats. Al Gore's [...] "passion for technological issues, from biomedical research and genetic engineering to {{the environmental impact of}} the [...] "greenhouse effect," [...] linked him with other technological politicians on Capitol Hill known as Atari Democrats." [...] TIME magazine noted that Tim Wirth [...] "made a reputation as the typical [...] "Atari Democrat," [...] who urges growth and investment in high-technology industries."The New York Times referred to Paul Tsongas as an Atari Democrat, [...] "a member of the young generation of politicians and economists who looked to high technology as a source of jobs and economic growth." [...] Gary Hart also referred to himself as an Atari Democrat and stated, [...] "I was, early on in my Senate career, described as an Atari Democrat. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> what that means because there are no more Ataris, but we were among the first - a small group of us to forecast the transition of the economy from industrialized manufacturing to the information age." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo {{expressed}} {{on numerous}} occasions their admiration for the music of Joni Mitchell, such as this quote by Thurston Moore: [...] "Joni Mitchell! I've used elements of her songwriting and guitar playing, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>know</b> about it." [...] Additionally, as with Sonic Youth, Joni Mitchell has always used a number of alternative tunings. The band named a song after her, [...] "Hey Joni".|$|R
5000|$|Probably <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>know</b> this; {{it did not}} matter. In the 1980s, Minsky and Good {{had shown}} how neural {{networks}} could be generated automatically—self replicated—in accordance with any arbitrary learning program.

In any given case, the precise details <b>would</b> never be <b>known,</b> and even if they were, they would be millions of times too complex for human understanding.|$|R
60|$|Poor George Foster now {{began to}} find out that the terrible truths which he had refused to believe were indeed great realities, and had now begun to affect himself. He {{experienced}} an awful sinking of the heart when {{it occurred to him that}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>know</b> anything about his fate, for the little boat would be sure to be found bottom up, sooner or later, and it would of course be assumed that he had been drowned.|$|R
2500|$|There are differing and {{complementary}} {{ideas on}} why LGBT communities, and expressly, gay men, {{are attracted to}} the holiday. Throughout the 1980s, Halloween street events in gay villages Key West, Florida, Christopher Street in New York, Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood and the Castro in San Francisco have evolved from informal parades into Mardi Gras-like events with [...] "drinking and dancing and carrying on in the streets". San Francisco's Polk street Halloween developed in the 1970s as people came out and moved to Castro street in 1979. In addition to stereotypes about why LGBT people are attracted to fashion, theatricality and dressing up there are cultural reasons [...] why the events have become [...] "the major holiday" [...] for LGBT people. In addition to the holiday's pagan roots, which is attractive {{to those who have}} been shunned by mainstream religions, many LGBT people are able to be outrageous and flamboyant even if they remain closeted. In the days before gay liberation, wearing masks symbolized that most gays were in the closet—if gays were interviewed on TV before 1969, they often wore masks so <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> their real identity.|$|E
2500|$|According to Rae Wear, Bjelke-Petersen demanded total {{loyalty of}} the media and was unforgiving and vindictive if {{reporting}} was not to his satisfaction. In 1984, he reacted to a series of critical articles in the Courier-Mail by switching the government's million-dollar classified advertising account to the rival Daily Sun. He banned a Courier-Mail reporter who was critical of his excessive use of the government aircraft and Wear claims other journalists who wrote critical articles became the subject of rumour-mongering, were harassed by traffic police, or found that [...] "leaks" [...] from the government dried up. Journalists covering industrial disputes and picketing were also afraid of arrest. In 1985, the Australian Journalists Association withdrew from the system of police passes because of police refusal to accredit certain journalists. Journalists, editors and producers were also deterred from critical stories by Bjelke-Petersen's increasing use of defamation actions {{in order to try to}} [...] "stop talk about a corrupt government". Queensland historian Ross Fitzgerald was threatened with criminal libel in 1984 when he sought to publish a critical history of the state. The premier and his ministers launched 24 defamation actions against the Opposition leader and Labor Party and trade union figures, with 14 of them publicly funded. He saw no role for the media in making government accountable, telling the Australian Financial Review in 1986: [...] "The greatest thing that could happen to the state and the nation is when we get rid {{of the media}}. Then we would live in peace and tranquillity and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>know</b> anything." ...|$|E

After the passing away of Master Vero, the Prince changed his character, involving himself more in sexual activities with women and drinking. He totally forsake religion.

He was talking with a crew member who started sharpening a Rambo knife and joked that he could easily kill Bennett and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>know.</b> The encounter unsettled Bennett and inspired him {{to write a story}} about a relationship where you did not completely know the other person. He worked on this 18 or 20 times {{over the next ten years}} but could never get the story right. Then he wrote it in three weeks and was satisfied.|$|R

Some 32 inmates die each year; only four generally gain parole each year. Louisiana's tough sentencing laws result in long sentences for the inmate population, who have been convicted of armed robbery, murder, and rape. In 1998 Peter Applebome of The New York Times wrote, [...] "It's impossible to visit the place and not feel that a prisoner could disappear {{off the face of the}} earth and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>know</b> or care." ...|$|R
