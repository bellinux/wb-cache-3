40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{identify}} the approaches undertaken in implementing equal employment opportunity in the transport, and services to transport industry. This male dominated industry employs limited <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> and consequently there are limited <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in management. The study investigates data from reports submitted to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency by organisations employing more than 100 persons.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{identify}} the approaches undertaken in implementing equal employment opportunity in the transport industry in Australia and the links between these approaches and indicators of increased participation <b>of</b> <b>women.</b> This male dominated industry employs limited <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> with fewer <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in management. The study analyses data from {{a unique set of}} equal opportunity progress reports from all organisations in the transport industry that are required to provide public reports under Australian legislation. The findings indicate a correlation between some approaches to equal opportunity and increased <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in some areas. The study is equally remarkable for what it does not find. Despite widespread equal opportunity implementation across a broad <b>number</b> <b>of</b> employment measures there are limited measures that predict increases in the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> in management or in non-traditional roles. This study differs from others in that it identifies issues specific to one industry and links organisational approach to equal opportunity with the employment status <b>of</b> both <b>women</b> and men. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{cultural}} icon, Nancy Drew {{is cited}} as a formative influence by a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women,</b> from Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Sonia Sotomayor to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former First Lady Laura Bush. Feminist literary critics have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic hero, an expression of wish fulfillment, or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about femininity.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name has been linked to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the mechanical ore crusher in 1804 the tasks traditionally carried out by bal maidens began to be mechanised. Despite this, the rapid growth of the mines in comparison to the slow spread of mechanisation meant the number of bal maidens appears to have risen steadily, although statistics for the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> employed in the mines {{in the early days of}} industrialisation are incomplete and a few are contradictory.|$|E
5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{leading up to}} 1848, a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> began to push against {{restrictions}} imposed upon them by society. A few men aided in this effort. In 1831, Reverend Charles Grandison Finney began allowing women to pray aloud in gatherings of men and women. The Second Great Awakening was challenging women's traditional roles in religion. Recalling the era in 1870, Paulina Wright Davis set Finney's decision {{as the beginning of}} the American women's reform movement.|$|E

5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo was the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many {{of the women were}} dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later {{as a result of their}} wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.|$|E
5|$|American Samoa is a {{territory}} of the United States that lies in the South Pacific Ocean {{to the far east}} of Australia. The dependency's debut at the Olympics was at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Between 1988 and 2008, American Samoa sent a delegation to participate at seven Olympic games (six Summer Olympics and one Winter Olympics), not missing a single Summer Olympics since its first time in the competition. In 2008, American Samoa's delegation was composed of four athletes, including two women, which is the greatest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> to have competed for American Samoa at any one games.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E
