40|$|The EU {{countries}} {{are interested in}} stable banking systems of candidate countries, because any kind of instability of the financial sector could have serious consequences to the financial and exchange rate system of the whole Community. In the article the state of stability of the banking systems is analyzed, based on several important indicators. At present the banking systems of candidate countries still look fairly stable: weak competition among the banks, a high inflation rate and a low intermediation rate in terms of total assets / GDP have enabled banks still to reach a sufficient <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> <b>yield.</b> So {{they have been able}} to stand a relatively high share of non- performing loans and also a relatively high amount of foreign exchange indebtedness. In order to ensure a problem-free integration of the banking systems of the candidate countries in the EU they must still meet several conditions. They need to widen and refine the supply of services and to lower the share of non-performing loans, mainly in the Czech Republic and Poland. The foreign exchange indebtedness of the banking and enterprises domains in Poland and Hungary needs to be restricted. Successful integration in EU competition requires in general increase in the banks own capital. ...|$|E

We use a sample of banks in the US over the period 1986 - 2012, and combine the Panel VAR with the GMM method. We find that changes in fee income have no impact on changes in <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. However, a decrease in <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins is followed {{by an increase in}} fee income in the subsequent year. This result is more pronounced for large banks after the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, which increased banks’ ability to generate fee income.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} bank regulations, concentration, inflation, and national institutions on bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins using data from over 1, 400 banks across 72 countries while controlling for bank-specific characteristics. The data indicate that tighter regulations on bank entry and bank activities boost <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. Inflation also exerts a robust, positive impact on bank margins. While concentration is positively associated with <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins, this relationship breaks down when controlling for regulatory impediments to competition and inflation. Furthermore, bank regulations become insignificant when controlling for national indicators of economic freedom or property rights protection, while these institutional indicators robustly explain cross-bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. So, bank regulations cannot be viewed in isolation. They reflect broad, national approaches to private property and competition.

40|$|Interest rate {{risk and}} bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins 1 Banks and their {{supervisors}} have spent considerable {{time and effort}} in recent years developing systems for monitoring and managing interest rate risk. 2 This special feature examines that specific component of interest rate risk arising from the possible effects of changes in market interest rates on bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. Such effects can be very large if interest rate risk is not managed carefully. For example, the secondary banking crisis in the United Kingdom in the 1970 s reflected, at least in part, the funding of longer-term assets with short-term liabilities. 3 Similarly, funding of long-term, fixed rate mortgages with savings deposits led to a very sharp drop in <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins at US thrift institutions in the early 1980 s when interest rates rose to historic highs and the yield curve inverted. The result was actually negative <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> income for two years at US thrifts, after <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins had averaged nearly 1. 5 % over the preceding decade (FHLBB (1984)). By contrast, the results presented here suggest that commercial banks in the 10 industrial countries considered have generally managed their exposures to volatility in the yield curve in ways that have limited effects on their <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. Thus, while fluctuations in <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins could be {{an important source of}} uncertainty in bank profitability – and could surely have adverse effects for particular institutions – changes in interest rates seem unlikely to undermine sharply the health of the banking sector through their effects on <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> income. The next section provides background on interest rate risk at banks, and discusses methods for assessing it. Given data limitations, the approach taken here focuses on the effects of market interest rates on the average yields on bank assets and liabilities and also on bank <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins. The subsequent section reports on the empirical findings. A final section provides some concluding remarks and caveats. 1 The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS.

Prior to 2008 the <b>net</b> <b>interest</b> margins declined primarily due to strong capital inflows and stable macroeconomic environment. In the crisis period, significant rise in government debt accompanied by the increase in macroeconomic risks and abating capital inflows were pushing margins up while other factors such as low credit demand, higher capitalization and significantly increased share of non-performing loans pressured banks’ margins down.
