D.) : Bilkent University, Department of Management, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2015. Labor {{is one of}} the most important input to the firm. Firms pay wages to employees in return for their human capital. Operating leases are the largest source of external financing to the firm. Labor costs and <b>non-cancellable</b> <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> expenses are two large claims on firm cash flows. This dissertation is focused on how these almost fixed costs affect firm risk and expected returns. Three essays empirically examine the links among cost inflexibility, cash flow sensitivity to business cycle and operating leverage risk. The first essay empirically documents that firms with more operating lease commitments earn a significant premium over firms with fewer commitments, and this premium is countercyclical. The second essay shows that a measure of firm’s labor intensity relative to its industry is associated with higher equity returns for manufacturing firms. The third essay, using ex-ante implied cost of capital as a proxy for equity risk, shows that the firms that carry a relatively high labor share, have higher ex-ante discount rates. by Figen Güneş Doğan.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} that operating lease capitalisation has on key financial statement ratios and failure prediction indicators of listed South African companies operating within five sectors (namely General Industrials, Industrial Transportation, Food & Drug Retailers, General Retailers and Travel & Leisure), as well as whether the impact thereof is substantially {{the same as the}} new proposed accounting treatment for Type A and Type B leases in terms of ED/ 2013 / 6 (IASB, 2013). Furthermore, the extent of lease usage in South Africa and whether the size of a company has a bearing on its extent of leasing is examined. Additional analysis is also performed investigating the materiality of straight-lining and onerous contract provisions relating to operating leases, as well as the impact of operating lease capitalisation on disclosed loan covenants. Based predominantly on the constructive operating lease capitalisation method developed by Imhoff, Lipe and Wright (1991 & 1997), a refined constructive lease capitalisation model is developed in this study which incorporates aspects of current lease accounting rules not previously considered, namely provisions recognised in respect of the straight-lining of operating leases as well as onerous operating lease contracts. This model also incorporates the new proposed lease accounting rules which require the capitalisation of all leases (Type A and Type B). The results indicate that the capitalisation of future <b>non-cancellable</b> <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> commitments {{have a significant impact on}} key financial statement ratios and failure prediction indicators, most notably leverage and other debt-related ratios. Furthermore, of the five sectors analysed, retailers were the most affected. When considering the new proposed accounting treatment for Type A and Type B leases, the results indicate that operating lease capitalisation has substantially the same impact on key financial statement ratios and Altman‟s failure prediction models as the conventional operating lease capitalisation method, except for certain debt-related and profitability ratios. Further results indicate that operating leases are used extensively and substantially more than finance leases within South Africa. It was also found that operating lease usage was positively related to company size, while finance lease usage decreased as company size increased. Curvilinear relationships were also noted between a company‟s size and its extent of leasing. Further analysis revealed that recognised straight-lining lease provisions are substantially more material than recognised onerous lease contract provisions and are capable of distorting the analysis of operating lease capitalisation if ignored. When scrutinising loan covenants disclosed, it was established that none of the loan covenants were breached when capitalising operating leases; however, in each instance operating lease capitalisation negatively impacted all covenant related ratios...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to examine}} {{determinants}} of <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> policies (i. e. financial constraint, asset value, growth, and firm's size), {{and the impact of}} constructive capitalisation of <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> towards company's financial ratios. The finding shows that all determinants except financial constraints influence <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> policies but most of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> is explained by factors other than the economic determinants. To restrict the abuse of <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> that mislead users of financial statements, then <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> should be capitalized.

40|$|Abstract RESEARH OBJECTIVES The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the value relevance of constructively capitalized <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> Currently, leases are classified either <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> or capital leases. Unlike capital <b>leases,</b> <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> are reported as rental expense and omitted from balance sheet. Information of <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> commitments is disclosed in footnotes. <b>Operating</b> <b>leases</b> represent one of the largest source of off-balance sheet financing. There has been a concern among standard setters for a long time, whether the current accounting practice offers reliable representation of leasing transactions that companies are engaged into for financial statement users. This study aims to examine, if the <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> commitments are reflected in the share prices, i. e. if the market perceives the <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> information correctly, even though reported off-balance sheet. DATA AND METHODOLOGY The data used in this study is obtained from Compustat. The data is from years 1993 - 2013 and comprises observations of listed companies on air transportation industry, totaling to 850 observations. The study is conducted using OLS regression analysis, by estimating three different models. FINDINGS The study fails to find incremental information content for constructively capitalized <b>operating</b> <b>leases,</b> beyond that contained in reported assets, liabilities and sales. Thus, study fails to find evidence for value relevance of <b>operating</b> <b>leases...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study investigates whether {{including}} <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> commitments {{in financial}} distress prediction models {{would increase the}} classification accuracy of these models. Classification accuracy measures the percentages of correctly classified companies in {{either of the two}} categories (healthy or financially distressed). This study includes 38 listed companies in financial distress (of which 21 companies eventually went bankrupt) and 62 healthy companies in the period from 2000 to 2004. It is concluded that financially distressed companies use relatively more <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> than healthy companies. However, the accuracy of the financial distress prediction models did not significantly improve by taking <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> into account. These results may contribute to the discussion on which type of lease-accounting is preferred: the current method in which <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> only appear in the notes to the financial statement, or the method of capitalizing financial and <b>operating</b> <b>leases...</b>|$|R
40|$|In 2008, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), in {{cooperation}} with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), will issue a new proposal to change the current accounting regulation with respect to leasing to an alternative approach. This new lease-accounting approach, called the “asset and liability approach”, capitalises all leases on the balance sheet. This contrasts with the current lease-accounting approach, called the “risk and reward approach”, which discriminates between the recognition of financial leases on the balance sheet and the disclosure of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> off the balance sheet. As with the current risk and reward approach, also the asset and liability approach has many opponents. This study investigates: - what the impact on financial ratios might be when <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> are capitalised on the balance sheet, - what company characteristics determines the choice for <b>operating</b> <b>leases,</b> and - whether financially-distressed companies use more <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> than healthy companies. The results show that <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> have become a major financing source, which is not only attributable to the accounting treatment of <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> However, the information on <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> as required in the footnotes to the financial statements is not transparent, nor reliable. The current lease-accounting standards might be maintained but improved, and this could be an intermediate solution that is acceptable for the proponents of both lease-accounting approaches...|$|R

40|$|This paper updates prior {{research}} on aircraft leasing and contrasts {{the findings of}} current data with prior results. Usage of leases by air carriers is a means to lessen the impact of financial obligations from fleet purchases. The study revisits two previous studies, one in 1969 and one in 1991, which is analyzed the incidence of leases by major air carriers. The current study updates these past studies to consider air carriers current usage of <b>leases.</b> Additionally, since <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> are not reflected in the balance sheets of airlines, <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> information was capitalized using a present value of future <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> payments. Then, financial debt burden ratios were computed to determine the impact from the capitalization of lease information. The usage of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> increased, significantly from the first study to the 1991 study, and this trend continues. The incidence of leasing, the classification of <b>leases</b> as <b>operating,</b> {{and the percentage of}} <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> to total fleet have all increased {{for the majority of the}} airlines reviewed.

40|$|<b>Operating</b> <b>leases</b> {{have grown}} {{significantly}} {{as a source}} of corporate financing over the last 30 years. Their off-balance sheet treatment, which may in part explain their popularity, raises concern that financial risk may be misjudged and capital misallocated. Prior research evidence on the above issue is mixed. To improve reporting transparency, regulators propose a new accounting concept, right of use, which will add the present value of most leases to the balance sheet. We examine the effect of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> on loan pricing by banks, a sophisticated financial statement user. Since leases are a potential debt substitute, we expect them to be important in our setting. With loan spreads as the dependent variable, we test the differential explanatory power and model fit of as-reported financial ratios versus financial ratios adjusted for the capitalization of <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> We find that lease-adjusted financial ratios better explain loan spreads, especially for larger lenders. Our results also suggest that retailer leases that are closer in substance to rental agreements than financed asset purchases are less relevant for credit risk assessments. Thus we conclude that banks not only price <b>operating</b> <b>leases,</b> on average, but also make distinctions about which leases should be priced. Second, we explore the role of credit rating agencies and confirm that credit ratings also reflect capitalized <b>operating</b> <b>leases,</b> and find support for an informational role for others’ credit assessments. However, unlike banks, rating agencies appear to capitalize all <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> mechanically. Overall, our results suggest that banks and rating agencies adjust for the off-balance sheet presentation of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> and, at least in the case of banks, attempt to do so to reflect the underlying economics of the leases. This evidence lessens concern over the potential negative consequences of existing <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> accounting and raises concern over proposed accounting that capitalizes all leases regardless of their economic characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{documents}} {{the importance of}} leasing in the UK retail sector and estimates the potential balance sheet impact of new accounting proposals to bring all leases onto lessees’ balance sheets. Off-balance sheet <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> are {{shown to be a}} major source of finance, and far more important (3. 3 times higher) than on-balance sheet long-term debt; by contrast, finance <b>leases</b> are immaterial. <b>Operating</b> <b>leased</b> assets, the major part of which is ‘land and buildings’ (98 %), represent a significant proportion (28 %) of reported total assets. Capitalization of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> would {{have a major impact on}} nine key performance ratios and would alter the ranking of companies markedly.

The study presents the impact of <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> capitalization on companies’ financial statements and financial analysis ratios. The results show a negative impact of <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> capitalization on financial analysis ratios.

While the FASB specified that <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> liabilities should be considered [...] "non-debt liabilities," [...] so {{that they should not}} affect debt ratios and most loan covenants, the addition of an equal asset and liability will reduce most companies' quick ratio, while the fact that an <b>operating</b> <b>lease</b> creates a current liability but not a current asset reduces the current ratio.

40|$|While leases {{are widely}} used to finance {{productive}} assets in the U. S, lease accounting has been sharply criticized for providing incomplete and unreliable information to investors because many leases are arranged off-balance sheet as <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> As such, a higher cost of equity capital may be required by investors to compensate for unrecorded liabilities and imperfect information. In this dissertation, I provide the empirical evidence as to how equity market participants perceive the off-balance sheet leases. ^ First, I investigate the firm characteristics that determine the choice on <b>operating</b> versus capital <b>leases.</b> By summarizing the results from prior literature, I identify the determinants from three areas: operating risks, financial constraints and tax-driven incentives. The results suggest that both economic and opportunistic reasons drive a firm 2 ̆ 7 s lease choice. Specifically, fast-growing, financially constrained, or low-tax firms opt for off-balance sheet <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> ^ Second, I {{examine the impact of}} off-balance sheet <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> on the cost of equity, and whether it would be different from that of capital leases or conventional debt. The results suggest that off-balance sheet <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> are “value relevant” as indicated by an increased cost of equity capital being associated with greater use of <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> However, investors also seem to suffer from the off-balance sheet position of disclosed <b>operating</b> <b>leases.</b> The leverage effect of <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> is largely attenuated relative to capital leases and conventional debt. ^ Third, I explore the role of information intermediaries in compensation for the deficiency in accounting for leases. The results indicate that the cost of equity, with respect to the use of off-balance sheet leases, diminishes in greater analyst followings and the existence of credit ratings. Specifically, the diminishing effect of 2 ̆ 7 financial analysts is more pronounced on off-balance sheet <b>operating</b> <b>leases</b> than that on capital leases and conventional debt. Lastly, whether a firm is audited by a big 4 / 5 / 6 / 8 firm appears to have no effect on either off- or on-balance sheet leases. ^ This study contributes to the Financial Accounting Standard Board 2 ̆ 7 s lease accounting project and helps investors assess the risk of firms with off-balance sheet leases. ...|$|R
