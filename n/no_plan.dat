5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in the photograph The Falling Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. <b>No</b> <b>plan</b> existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010–11 season, the Rockets {{said they}} would limit Yao to 24 minutes a game, with <b>no</b> <b>plan</b> to play him on {{back-to-back}} nights. Their goal was to keep Yao healthy in the long term. On December 16, 2010, {{it was announced that}} Yao had developed a stress fracture in his left ankle, related to an older injury, and would miss the rest of the season. In January 2011, he was voted as the Western Conference starting center for the 2011 All-Star Game for the eighth time in nine seasons. Injured All-Stars are usually required to attend the All-Star functions and to be introduced at the game, but Yao was not in Los Angeles because of his rehabilitation schedule after his surgery. Yao's contract with the Rockets expired {{at the end of the}} season, and he became a free agent.|$|E
5|$|The Eretrian {{strategy}} was to defend their walls, and undergo a siege. Possibly {{this was the only}} plan that could be agreed on, or became the default option when <b>no</b> <b>plan</b> was agreed. At any rate, since the Persian army had only suffered two defeats in the last century, and since a Greek army had never successfully fought the Persians, this was probably a sensible strategy. Since the Persians arrived by ship, it is probable they had little siege equipment, and indeed, they had already been foiled in the siege of Lindos earlier in the expedition.|$|E

5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and <b>no</b> <b>plan</b> was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they could get to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E
5|$|During Dunderdale's {{tenure as}} premier the Fisheries {{portfolio}} {{has seen a}} significant overturn at the ministerial level. In {{less than three years}} Dunderdale had appointed her fourth Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. Keith Hutchings became that fourth minister after his appointment on October 9, 2013. Following his appointment a representative with the Fish, Food and Allied Workers union said he hoped to see the minister stay in his portfolio {{for a longer period of}} time, as he was the seventh minister in the portfolio in ten years. Dunderdale's first Fisheries minister was Clyde Jackman, who had been the minister when Dunderdale succeeded Williams as premier. Jackman remained minister until after the 2011 provincial election, when Darin King took over the portfolio. Eleven months later King was succeeded by Derrick Dalley who was minister for the next year. Opposition parties criticized government after Hutchings appointment saying the overturn in ministers showed that there was <b>no</b> <b>plan</b> for the fishery.|$|E

25|$|However, {{free trade}} {{does not prevent}} a nation from {{establishing}} some sort of emergency plan to become temporarily self-sufficient in case of war or that a nation could simply acquire what it needs from a different nation. A {{good example of this}} is World War I, during which both Britain and Germany became partially self-sufficient. This is particularly important because Germany had <b>no</b> <b>plan</b> for creating a War economy.|$|E
25|$|Nazi Germany, however, had <b>no</b> <b>plan</b> {{or desire}} to restore {{autonomy}} to Latvia, {{even though they}} ordered Colonel Alexander Plesners to oversee formation of the Latvian Defence Forces.

Their mission was internal security and defence against a possible Russian threat through Afghanistan. As the war progressed, the size and role of the Indian Army expanded dramatically, and troops were sent to battle fronts as soon as possible. The most serious problem was lack of equipment.|$|E

25|$|With the {{invention}} of agriculture, humans were able to clear sections of rainforest to produce crops, converting it to open farmland. Such people, however, obtain their food primarily from farm plots cleared from the forest and hunt and forage within the forest to supplement this. The issue arising is between the independent farmer providing for his family and the needs and wants of the globe as a whole. This issue has seen little improvement because <b>no</b> <b>plan</b> has been established for all parties to be aided.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{have yet}} to uncover {{a single piece of}} {{contemporary}} evidence indicating that Hitler, Himmler, Bormann, or any other authority had any serious intention, let alone plan, to invade Vatican City and carry out Pope Pius XII.
