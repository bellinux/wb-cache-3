40|$|We {{consider}} an economical bilinear rectangular mixed finite element scheme on regular mesh for generalized <b>Newtonian</b> <b>flows,</b> where the viscosity obeys a Carreau type law for a pseudo-plastic. The key {{issue in the}} scheme {{is that the two}} components of the velocity and the pressure are defined on different meshes. Optimal error bounds for both the velocity and pressure are obtained by proving a discrete Babuska–Brezzi inf–sup condition on the regular quadrangulation. Finally, we perform some numerical experiments, including an example in a unit square with exact solutions, a backward-facing step and a four-to-one abrupt contraction generalized <b>Newtonian</b> <b>flows.</b> Numerical experiments confirm our error bounds.

For an isotropic <b>Newtonian</b> <b>flow</b> it is a scalar, while for anisotropic Newtonian flows {{it can be a}} second-order tensor too. The fundamental aspect is that for a Newtonian fluid the dynamic viscosity is independent on flow velocity (i.e., the shear stress constituive law is linear), while non-Newtonian flows this is not true, and one should allow for the modification: ...|$|E
50|$|The above {{formula is}} no longer the Newton's law but a generic {{tensorial}} identity: one could always find an expression of the viscosity as function of the flow velocity given any expression of the shear stress as function of the flow velocity. On the other hand, given a shear stress as function of the flow velocity, it represents a <b>Newtonian</b> <b>flow</b> only if it can be expressed as a constant for the gradient of the flow velocity. The constant one finds in this case is the dynamic viscosity of the flow.|$|E

50|$|On {{one end of}} the {{spectrum}} we have an inviscid or a simple Newtonian fluid and on the other end, a rigid solid; thus the behaviour of all materials fall somewhere in between these two ends. The difference in material behaviour is characterized by the level and nature of elasticity present in the material when it deforms, which takes the material behaviour to the non-Newtonian regime. The non-dimensional Deborah number is designed to account for the degree of non-Newtonian behaviour in a flow. The Deborah number is defined as the ratio of the characteristic time of relaxation (which purely depends on the material and other conditions like the temperature) to the characteristic time of experiment or observation. Small Deborah numbers represent <b>Newtonian</b> <b>flow,</b> while non-Newtonian (with both viscous and elastic effects present) behaviour occurs for intermediate range Deborah numbers, and high Deborah numbers indicate an elastic/rigid solid. Since Deborah number is a relative quantity, the numerator or the denominator can alter the number. A very small Deborah number can be obtained for a fluid with extremely small relaxation time or a very large experimental time, for example.|$|E
