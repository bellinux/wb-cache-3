5|$|In the end, Carys is {{reunited with}} her father. The team returns to Torchwood, {{and as she}} leaves for home, Jack advises Gwen <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the job consume her because her {{perspective}} {{is important to the}} team. He then encourages Gwen to go home and spend time with Rhys.|$|E
5|$|Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), grieving {{the loss}} of her former partner, is in denial over Doakes's {{incrimination}} and tries to collect donations for his memorial service. Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) remains determined <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the end of the Bay Harbor Butcher case break up her relationship with Lundy, but their plans for a vacation are crushed when Lundy is called to Oregon to work on another murder case.|$|E
5|$|Moon's {{friendship}} with Entwistle {{led to an}} appearance on Smash Your Head Against the Wall, Entwistle's first solo album and the first {{by a member of}} the Who. Moon did not play drums on the album; Jerry Shirley did, with Moon providing percussion. Rolling Stone's John Hoegel appreciated Entwistle's decision <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Moon drum, saying that it distanced his album from the familiar sound of the Who.|$|E
5000|$|ESPN's Mike Breen, {{who called}} the Finals for ABC, added: [...] "It's {{just another example of}} how he's just <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them lose. That was the thought as well after he blocked the shot: This guy is just <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> this team lose tonight." ...|$|R
60|$|Captain Marshall was angry, {{and he did}} <b>not</b> {{hesitate}} <b>to</b> <b>let</b> {{the first}} mate know it.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the party, Robert coaxes {{each of the}} {{employees}} into revealing their deepest fears. Before leaving, he tells a horror story implementing all their fears {{as a way to}} convince them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> fear control their lives. This inspires Jim and Pam to stop their argument and Erin to talk to Andy about her feelings.|$|E
5|$|Even then, Eberstein {{refused to}} ask Schack for {{assistance}} in the battle. Colonel Ditlev Ahlefeldt of the allied forces would <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> pride and vanity be {{the downfall of the}} attack and pleaded with Schack to attack. Shack brandished his rapier and mounted a forceful attack into the Swedish left flank. A bloody engagement ensued, but the Swedish cavalry was no match for the rested Danish forces—they fled towards Nyborg leaving the infantry defenseless. The Polish riders showed no pardon, cutting down the Swedish infantry almost to a man. The Dutch also intervened with an expeditionary fleet led by Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter.|$|E
5|$|Following the event, Gunn reverts Illyria to her demonic form, after which, Illyria {{decides to}} wholly {{collapse}} time and all existence. In {{an attempt to}} prevent Angel and his team from stopping Illyria, Gunn mortally wounds Connor. Connor pleads with Angel <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the Senior Partners win and assures him {{that he is a}} good person despite being a vampire. Connor then dies in Angel's arms. He is restored to life when Angel provokes Gunn into killing him, forcing the Senior Partners to turn back time to the moment of the original alleyway fight in the television finale. All those who died since the city was sent to hell come back to life and have their memories of the intervening time intact.|$|E

5|$|In Madison Park, Seattle, {{a family}} are {{gathered}} around the television. The mother leaves to go to bed, and {{the atmosphere in the}} room grows tense. The older of two sisters, Connie Bangs (Michelle Joyner) takes her sister Sara—who is clearly much younger than she is—to her bedroom and locks her in, warning her <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> her father inside. Connie runs out of the house, fighting off her father, and is later found wandering the streets confused. She is taken to clinical social worker Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher), and admits that her father has been sexually abusing her for years.|$|E
5|$|It did {{not take}} Louis XVIII long {{to go back on}} one of his many promises. He and his ComptrollerGeneral of Finance Baron Louis were {{determined}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the exchequer fall into deficit (there was a 75million franc debt inherited from Napoleon I), and took fiscal measures to ensure this. Louis XVIII assured the French that the unpopular taxes on tobacco, wine and salt would be abolished when he was restored, but he failed to do so, which led to rioting in Bordeaux. Expenditures on the army was slashed in the 1815 budget– in 1814, the military had accounted for 55% of government spending.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar's {{rapid rise}} to the top of WWE in 2002 led to a feud with The Undertaker, which {{involved}} a match at Unforgiven on September 22. The match ended in a double disqualification and Lesnar retained the title. Lesnar faced The Undertaker again at No Mercy, this time in a Hell in a Cell match. Leading up to the match, in the storyline, Lesnar broke The Undertaker's hand with a propane tank. Despite Heyman begging McMahon <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> The Undertaker use his cast as a weapon, the request was denied and the match went on as planned. At No Mercy on October 20, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to retain the title. After his Hell in a Cell match with The Undertaker, Lesnar successfully retained the WWE Championship in a handicap match with Heyman against Edge at Rebellion on October 26.|$|E

5|$|Producers {{created an}} {{infidelity}} {{story for the}} character which involved David's half-brother Nick Tilsley (Ben Price). David discovers the truth but decides <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Kylie know. Shepherd told Alison Gardner from What's on TV that David thinks if he confronts Kylie their relationship will end. He has to decide who should be punished for the affair. He decides that Nick is to blame {{and if he is}} to get revenge on him then Kylie must remain oblivious. He then contemplates committing suicide and then vandalises Nick's flat. The actor concluded that David could forgive Kylie for her infidelity.|$|E
5|$|Richard White as Gaston – A vain {{hunter who}} vies for Belle's hand in {{marriage}} and is determined <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> anyone else win her heart. He {{serves as a}} foil personality to the Beast, who was once as egotistic as Gaston prior to his transformation. Gaston's supervising animator, Andreas Deja, was pressed by Jeffrey Katzenberg to make Gaston handsome {{in contrast to the}} traditional appearance of a Disney villain, an assignment he found difficult at first. In the beginning, Gaston is depicted as more of a narcissist than a villain, but later he leads all the villagers to kill the beast, enraged that Belle would love a Beast more than him.|$|E
5|$|The factual {{accuracy}} of the series is often criticised by legal professionals and journalists; many of the decisions taken by Deed are unlikely to happen in a real court. The romanticised vision of the court system created by Newman caused a judge to issue a warning to a jury <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the series influence their view of trials—referring to an episode where Deed flouts rules when called up for jury service. A complaint was made by a viewer about one episode claiming biased and incorrect information about the MMR vaccine, leading the BBC to unilaterally ban repeats of it in its original form. All six series (with {{the exception of the}} two banned episodes from Series Five) have been released on DVD in the UK.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is visited by her ex-boyfriend, Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), who informs {{her that he}} is a sex addict, now atoning for his past errors. Liz is unimpressed and asks Dennis to leave, before going to work. Later, after {{arriving}} at work, Liz answers Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) cellphone, and is surprised to find that Dennis is calling Jenna. Liz pretends to be Jenna and discovers that Jenna and Dennis slept together. Liz is determined <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> this revelation affect her friendship with Jenna, so the two go to confront Dennis about his behavior. During the confrontation, Liz discovers that Jenna and Dennis actually slept together in her bed, leading her to resent Jenna's actions. As a result, she fails to tell Jenna about an improperly attached piece of equipment, leading Jenna to injure her leg.|$|E
5|$|McCoy {{was born}} in Hobbs, New Mexico. He is the eldest of three {{children}} born to Steven Brad McCoy and Debra Kay (Woodruff) McCoy. He attended Jim Ned High School in Tuscola, Texas, population 714, where he was coached in football by his father, Brad McCoy. He achieved several distinctions {{as a high school}} player, including two-time Associated Press 2A Offensive MVP and First-team All-state selection. Over his career, he completed 536-of-849 passes (63.1%) for 9,344 yards and 116 TDs. He ranks as the all-time leading passer in Texas Division 2A high school history and is fourth overall in Texas high school history. McCoy also served as Jim Ned High School's punter as a junior and senior. During his sophomore year, McCoy was also playing free safety. However, after he suffered a concussion while tackling 215-pound Bangs High School running back Jacoby Jones (not {{to be confused with the}} Baltimore Ravens wide receiver of the same name), his father decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him play defense anymore. At the time Jim Ned was 8–0, but as McCoy missed the next two games due to the concussion, Jim Ned's season unraveled. McCoy also played in the 2003 Texas 2A State Championship against the San Augustine Wolves. Jim Ned lost 28–7.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter, {{with help}} from his {{children}} Chris and Meg, decides to create his own animated series about a trio of handicapped ducks entitled Handi-Quacks. All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational suggestions are shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their more unusual and nonsensical ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then decide on a joke involving a wood stove and a house of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion about his work impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode unedited, but he decides <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E

5|$|Somalia {{received}} universality places (a wildcard {{for athletes}} {{who have not}} attained qualification standards) from the International Association of Athletics Federations to send one male and one female athlete to the 2012 Summer Olympics. The two athletes that were selected to represent Somalia at the London Games were Mohamed Hassan Mohamed in the men's 1500 metres and Zamzam Mohamed Farah in the women's 400 metres. Along with the two athletes, the country's delegation was led by chef de mission Omar Barajab. The athletes' training at Mogadishu Stadium and in the city's roads (which was for six days a week) was hampered {{by the death of}} the country's National Olympic Committee (NOC) president Aden Yabarow Wiish in a suicide bombing in April 2012, but their coach Ahmed Ali encouraged the runners <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the event influence their training. Both competitors were not confirmed until July 2012 because the NOC did not wish to jeopardise their safety by making them targets. Long-distance runner Abdinasir Said Ibrahim had been due to compete but withdrew because of extreme stress caused by unsafe roads which lowered his mental morale. Farah was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{has been}} often {{dismissed}} as a fable and Paul was conscious {{of the risk of}} disbelief. For this reason, he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of Ticinum in the hands of king Ratchis. The use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and, in particular, among the Lombards' neighbors, the Avars. Skull cups are believed {{to be part of a}} shamanistic ritual, where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man's powers. In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimund's skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemy's skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for the offering of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause of shame or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queen's answer reveals her determination <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.|$|E
5|$|In {{his letter}} of 29 October 1862, Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory named yard number 294 as North Carolina and number 295 as Mississippi. In January 1863 the Foreign Secretary, Lord Russell, {{notified}} Bulloch, who had purchased the ships {{in his own}} name, that the ships would be prevented from sailing if they were doing so to form part of the fleet of a nation currently at war. Bulloch therefore transferred ownership to some French bankers in June 1863, nominally {{on behalf of the}} Egyptian government, with the intention of transferring them to the Confederate flag once they were at sea. The Khedive was attempting to acquire warships, so this was superficially plausible. North Carolina, later HMS Scorpion, was given the cover name of El Toussan and Mississippi, later HMS Wivern, received the name of El Monnassir. Lord Russel, prompted by the protests of the U.S. Ambassador, Charles F. Adams queried the Egyptian government directly and confirmed that this was merely a subterfuge to disguise the true ownership of the vessels. The Admiralty was prompted to send a guard ship, , to watch over the newly launched El Toussan after Lairds had made a request to begin sea trials in September. The Liverpool Collector of Customs was instructed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the ship leave her graving dock under any circumstances and the Surveyor of Customs finally seized the ships on 9 October.|$|E
