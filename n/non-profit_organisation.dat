40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Design in the Faculty of Informatics and Design at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2013 As healthcare is such a widespread issue in South Africa, this research focuses on <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> in the health sector. <b>Non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> take on {{much of the work}} that the government cannot deliver with respect to the overall wellbeing of patients at hospitals, in specialised care, in basic healthcare, and most significantly, in areas where private healthcare is unaffordable. This study investigates online marketing, fundraising activities and strategies of <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> in Cape Town’s health sector. It illustrates the growing popularity of these channels, and argues that many <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> are not using online marketing tools effectively to raise the funds and support they need. Two longstanding <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> based at the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital, are the subject of the study, as this hospital {{is a prime example of}} how a government-run institution relies on the support of effective <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations.</b> The conceptual framework required extensive reviews of the existing literature on the South African non-profit sector, the health sector and the role of <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> in these sectors. Furthermore, it reviewed successful marketing practices for <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations,</b> including appropriate online marketing and fundraising strategies. A qualitative and quantitative research approach was employed, using semi-structured interviews and an online survey of twenty-seven health sector <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations.</b> Key people in the non-profit health sector, the non-profit communication design sector and the corporate online marketing sector were interviewed. The online survey was conducted to gain a clear insight into the current online marketing practices and activities of Cape Town based health sector <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations.</b> Grounded theory was used as an analytical tool in this research where themes emerge and theory is constructed based on insights and knowledge gained during the research. The results reveal that many <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> in the Cape Town health sector do not seem aware of the benefits of implementing an online marketing and fundraising strategy. This study concludes that online marketing and fundraising is vital for a non-profit organisation’s success. It is recommended that all members of <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> learn as much as they can about the importance of online marketing, as well as the importance of having a solid strategy. A unique framework for branding, strategy, online marketing and fundraising is proposed as a solution to the research problem, and further recommendations include the design of a textbook or eBook and an online platform connecting <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> in the health sector in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|<b>Non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> are {{of great}} {{importance}} in community development. These organisations often take up those issues of concern in communities, which profit making organisations {{are not interested in}} pursuing. Many South African <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> remain dependent on sources of revenue such as subsidies, donations or grants (if available) from the government or the private sector. As times have changed in the country whereby such revenue sources are limited, <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> focus on becoming more efficient in the management of these <b>organisations.</b> Managing <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> is in many cases carried out by participants on a voluntary basis. Projects and programmes can ensure meaningful outcomes if Strategic Management principles and processes are applied efficiently in the initial phases of development. Some examples of <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> in communities are evident in the form of educational institutions, social and welfare organisations, environmental community forums and organisations representing the business sector.

40|$|In this study, the {{relationships}} among relationship maintenance strategies, organisation-public relationships, {{and support for the}} organisation were examined. In particular, the focus is on <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> in South Korea, which has seldom been subject to public relations relationship management research. Support for organisations was conceptualised and measured as intention to donate and volunteer, as <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> heavily rely on these two types of public support. A survey of 275 members from five different <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> in South Korea was conducted from May to June 2008. Findings of the study showed that relationship maintenance strategies are critical antecedents of organisation-public relationships. Furthermore, the quality of organisation-public relationships significantly affected the public’s intention to support <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations.</b> Theoretical and practical implications of the study results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Whilst brand {{management}} {{as a specific}} sub-field of marketing management is well developed in business research, it is still an emerging area in <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations.</b> <b>Non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> are faced with distinct brand challenges, which include issues related to multiple stakeholders in managing the brand {{and the need to}} negotiate partnering and sponsorship arrangements. Newly established <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> can begin their organisational development with strong branding strategies, however many established <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> have a strong brand heritage, which requires special preservation, renewal and extension strategies. This paper uses a case study methodology to examine the branding issues in Surf Life Saving Australia, a volunteer community beach safety organisation that holds a unique position in the Australian community and cultural psyche, which nevertheless must continually renew and extend its brand heritage in order to achieve its evolving organisational objectives. While the organisation is unique, the paper identifies issues in stakeholder {{brand management}} and brand preservation, renewal and extension with wider theoretical and practical implications for <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> and contemporary perspectives on branding.

40|$|I {{chose the}} topic of my diploma thesis ?Role and Compass and Potential of Non-government <b>Non-profit</b> <b>Organisations</b> when Solving Crisis Situations and System of Co-operation between them and Bodies of Crisis Management? because I believe that <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> {{play a key role}} at {{providing}} help to people in distress. I pay high attention to the <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> which, within their compass, try to help people in distress. They attempt to mitigate the consequences of emergencies or crisis situations, which can affect any human being at any time. It was only when I started studying at the University of South Bohemia and when working for the police that I found out that the <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> which operate in the Czech Republic depend mainly on the grant policy, sponsorship and human approach {{of the people who are}} employed in these organisations or support them in whatever way. Having chosen {{the topic of}} my diploma thesis, I have tried to summarize and submit as much information for the readers of this paper to absorb as many data as possible on the <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> which work within the South-Bohemian region and are available when preparing and solving emergencies and crisis situations. I have made an attempt to describe their role, compass and employment at emergencies. The other objective of my thesis is to describe their communication within the Emergency Services and with the bodies of Crisis Management. The objective of my diploma thesis is to analyse the activities of non-government <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> when dealing with crisis situations and emergencies. Based on qualitative research, this goal was met. Nowadays, in the time of economic crises both in the Czech Republic and in the world, I must state that to secure funding, material and human resources, which would enable their workers to perform the activities given by their mission, represents for the <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> a superhuman task. The hypothesis that the system of co-operation of the bodies of Crisis Management and <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> is sufficient has been confirmed. The hypothesis that the activities of <b>non-profit</b> <b>organisations</b> when dealing with crisis situations and emergencies represent an important factor has been confirmed as well...|$|R
