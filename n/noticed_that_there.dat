5|$|A {{breakthrough}} came in 1948 when {{a research}} group headed by John Enders at the Children's Hospital Boston successfully cultivated the poliovirus in human {{tissue in the}} laboratory. This group had recently successfully grown mumps in cell culture. In March 1948 Thomas H. Weller was attempting to grow varicella virus in embryonic lung tissue. He had inoculated the planned number of tubes when he <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were a few unused tubes. He retrieved a sample of mouse brain infected with polio virus and added it to the remaining test tubes, on the off chance that the virus might grow. The varicella cultures failed to grow but the polio cultures were successful.|$|E
5|$|Artillery, supplies, {{and troops}} were all being {{evacuated}} {{across the river}} at this time {{but it was not}} going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came. A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{did not seem to be}} any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|Hailing from Pomona, California, {{the members}} of Bonded by Blood met through mutual friends. The idea of {{creating}} a band was conceived by lead vocalist Jose Barrales, a singer with hardcore punk and crossover thrash backgrounds, influenced by groups like The Blackheads, Cryptic Slaughter, D.R.I. and Black Flag. He always had an appreciation for heavy metal music, {{but it was not}} until a friend recommended him to listen to Exodus that Barrales got into the thrash metal subgenre. Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood had a profound impact on Barrales, and it was inspiring to the point he idealized the creation of a thrash metal band, as he had <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were few or even no groups in this genre in the music scene.|$|E

But as the Dorniers neared the airfield they <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no smoke, or signs of damage. They expected to be polishing off a damaged fighter station. As the Germans burst over the airfield the air was suddenly filled with tracer rounds as the Dorniers' gunners engaged the Bofors and British AAA defences.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a flaw in}} how it handled {{very high}} first innings scores (350+) became {{apparent}} from the 1999 Cricket World Cup match in Bristol between India and Kenya. Tony Lewis <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was an inherent weakness in the formula that would give a noticeable advantage to the side chasing a total in excess of 350. A correction was built into the formula and the software, but was not fully adopted until 2004. One-day matches were achieving significantly higher scores than in previous decades, affecting the historical relationship between resources and runs. The second version uses more sophisticated statistical modelling, but does not use a single table of resource percentages. Instead, the percentages also vary with score, so a computer is required. Therefore, it loses some of the previous advantages of transparency and simplicity.|$|E
25|$|The {{numerous}} prehistoric creatures inhabiting Skull Island {{were brought}} to life {{through the use of}} stop-motion animation by Willis O’Brien and his assistant animator, Buzz Gibson. The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete after the special effects crew realized that they could not stop, because it would make the movements of the creatures seem inconsistent and the lighting would not have the same intensity over the many days it took to fully animate a finished sequence. A device called the surface gauge was used in order {{to keep track of the}} stop-motion animation performance. The iconic fight between Kong and the Tyrannosaurus took seven weeks to be completed. O’Brien’s protegé, Ray Harryhausen, who would work with him on several films and become one of the most prominent stop-motion animators in Hollywood, stated that O’Brien’s second wife <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was so much of her husband in Kong.|$|E

25|$|On 18 February 1943, the Scholls {{brought a}} {{suitcase}} full of leaflets {{to the university}} main building. They hurriedly dropped stacks of copies in the empty corridors for students to find {{when they left the}} lecture rooms. Leaving before the lectures had ended, the Scholls <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were some left-over copies in the suitcase and decided to distribute them. Sophie flung the last remaining leaflets from the top floor down into the atrium. This spontaneous action was observed by the university maintenance man, Jakob Schmied. Hans and Sophie Scholl were taken into Gestapo custody. A draft of a seventh pamphlet, written by Christoph Probst, was found in the possession of Hans Scholl {{at the time of his}} arrest by the Gestapo. While Sophie Scholl got rid of incriminating evidence before being taken into custody, Hans did try to destroy the draft of the last leaflet by tearing it apart and trying to swallow it down. However, the Gestapo recovered enough of it and were able to match the handwriting with other writings from Probst, which they found when they searched Hans's apartment.|$|E

But the lines in the stars of Oosterhoff type I (OoI) cluster are not quite as weak as those in type II (OoII).

500|$|The {{glow from}} the burning, and the news {{spreading}} quickly round London, ensured that crowds continued to turn up in increasing numbers to watch the spectacle. Among them was a reporter for The Times, who <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were [...] "vast gangs of the light-fingered gentry in attendance, who doubtless reaped a rich harvest, and [...] did not fail to commit several desperate outrages." [...] The crowds were so thick that they blocked Westminster Bridge {{in their attempts to}} get a good view, and many took to the river in whatever craft they could find or hire in order to watch better. A crowd of thousands congregated in Parliament Square to witness the spectacle, including the Prime Minister—Lord Melbourne—and many of his cabinet. Thomas Carlyle, the Scottish philosopher, was one of those present that night, and he later recalled that: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1972, {{the first}} major {{developments}} {{in regard to the}} state's population growth occurred. Adelaide's population was set to increase to 1.3 million and the MATS plan and water-storage schemes were in planning to accommodate this. These were summarily rejected by the Dunstan Government, which planned to build a new city 83kilometres from Adelaide, near Murray Bridge. The city, to be known as Monarto, was to be built on farmland {{to the west of the}} existing town. Dunstan was very much against allowing Adelaide's suburbs to further sprawl, and thus Monarto was a major focus of his government. He argued that the new South Eastern Freeway would allow a drive of only 45 minutes from Adelaide, that the city was not far from current industry, and that water could be readily supplied from the River Murray. The government hoped that Adelaide would not sprawl into the Mount Lofty Ranges to the east and that the bureaucracy would be dispersed from the capital. In contrast, public servants feared being forced into the rural settlement. Critics—of which there were many—derided the project as [...] "Dunstan's Versailles in the bush". Environmental activists aired fears of the effects of Monarto on the River Murray, which was already suffering from pollution and salinity problems. Later on, it was <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was hard bedrock underneath the ground, raising drainage problems.|$|E

500|$|Dipayan Pal of Mumbai Boss was {{disappointed}} {{in the book and}} theorized a number of reasons for it. He felt that the solid plot and the unambiguous storytelling of The Immortals of Meluha was missing in The Secret of the Nagas, whose ending failed to live up the curiosity. Pal particularly criticized Tripathi's language, saying [...] "It seems that while writing The Secret of the Nagas, much of Amish’s attention was upon language. There are obvious and woefully inept attempts at literary flair that make the novel a tiresome read. The book suffers from a rash of exclamation marks and unnecessary italics. Sentences have been sliced to create weak, dangling fragments ('Parashuram charged. Followed by his vicious horde'). Instead of simply talking, people bellow, scream, whisper and fall silent. They are flabbergasted, they pirouette {{in the middle of a}} fight, and use words like 'exponentially', 'gargantuan' and 'plethora' in their speech. The net result is text that is labored, trite and awkward." [...] Kishwar Desai from Asian Age felt that in The Secret of the Nagas, the characterization of Shiva lost some of the fervor in it from the first book, and is cast more as a Bollywood hero, comparable to the likes of actor Salman Khan. Desai also <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were too many characters in the book, most of them remaining unexplored. Likening the book with a computer game, the reviewer concluded that [...] "one of the remarkable qualities of [...] is that it is a very visual tale and less like a literary exercise." [...] Some critics like Sandipan Deb of Outlook though favored the visual style more and felt that Tripathi stayed true to the fantasy genre.|$|E
500|$|For the 2006 First West End Revival of Evita, actor Matt Rawle portrayed Che {{and sang}} the song. Michael Billington from The Guardian {{received}} it negatively, saying that [...] "Lacking any coherent idea, {{the show is}} motored by a succession of Lloyd Webber songs: 'Another Suitcase in Another Hall', ... 'Oh What a Circus', 'High Flying, Adored' and all the rest." [...] While reviving the play for Broadway in 2012, singer Ricky Martin was signed to play Che. The character was altered and instead of portraying Che Guevara like the original play, he was made a worker class everyman, who narrated the events. According to Joe Dziemianowicz from Daily News, Martin's performance as Che gave it [...] "a great big touch of star quality... He also gives an appealing performance {{in the role of}} Che," [...] the writer added. James Hebert from San Diego Union-Tribune complimented Martin for setting [...] "the tone right away in the opening number 'Oh What a Circus'" [...] with his [...] "bemused, smilingly cynical" [...] characterization of Che. In the 2014 Second West End Revival of the play, the role of Che was played by Marti Pellow from Scottish rock band Wet Wet Wet. Natalie Banyard complimented the choice of Pellow as Che, adding in an article for Bristol Post that [...] "Never was there a more inspired piece of casting than that of [...] as [...] in Evita." [...] Banyard also <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was [...] "no hint of Marti's Scottish brogue as he stops the show with his renditions of 'Oh What a Circus' and 'The Lady's Got Potential'." [...] Hank Marvin performed an instrumental version of the song on his 1997 album Hank Marvin and the Shadows Play the Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Australian {{producer}} Ian Collie {{produced a}} documentary film on P. L. Travers titled The Shadow of [...] "Mary Poppins". During the documentary's production, Collie <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was [...] "an obvious biopic there" [...] and convinced Essential Media and Entertainment {{to develop a}} feature film with Sue Smith writing the screenplay. The project {{attracted the attention of}} BBC Films, which decided to finance the project, and Ruby Films' Alison Owen, who subsequently hired Kelly Marcel to co-write the screenplay with Smith. Marcel's drafts removed a subplot involving Travers and her son, and divided the story into a two-part narrative: the creative conflict between Travers and Walt Disney, and her dealings with her childhood issues, describing it as [...] "a story about the pain of a little girl who suffered, and the grown woman who allowed herself to let go". Marcel's version, however, featured certain intellectual property rights of music and imagery which would be impossible to use without permission from The Walt Disney Company. [...] "There was always that elephant in the room, which is Disney," [...] Collie recalled. [...] "We knew Walt Disney was a key character in the film and we wanted to use quite a bit of the music. We knew we'd eventually have to show Disney." [...] In early 2010, Robert B. Sherman provided producer Alison Owen with an advance copy of a salient chapter from his then upcoming book release, [...] [...] The chapter entitled, [...] "'Tween Pavement and Stars" [...] contained characterizations and anecdotes which proved seminal to Marcel's script rewrite, in particular, the anecdote about there not being the color red in London. In July 2011, while attending the Ischia Film Festival, Owen met with Corky Hale, who offered to present the screenplay to Richard M. Sherman. Sherman read the screenplay and gave the producers his support. Later that year, Marcel and Smith's screenplay was listed in Franklin Leonard's The Black List, voted by producers {{as one of the best}} screenplays that were not in production.|$|E
