Electricity markets are significantly more volatile than other comparable financial or commodity markets. Extreme price outcomes, typically {{referred to as}} price spikes, as well as periods of substantial price volatility and their transmission between interconnected regional markets pose significant risks for market participants. This study investigates spillover effects for electricity spot prices across different regions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), aiming to provide {{a better understanding of}} price and volatility dynamics in a multi-regional context. This pioneering study is established in the econometric framework developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012), originally applied to equity markets. The research methodology is based on forecast error variance decomposition of vector autoregressive (VAR) models. We conduct both static and dynamic analyses to assess the systemically aggregated spillovers and their directional decomposition between regions. Using daily electricity spot market data from 2010 to 2015, we find that although spillover effects {{play an important role in}} the NEM, regional prices are still mostly influenced by local factors. In particular, greater spillover effects are observed between physically interconnected markets. Among all regions in the NEM, South Australia (SA) transmits the most net spillovers to others, while New South Wales (NSW) is the most significant net spillover receiver. The spillover effects show time-varying and event-dependent patterns. Our findings provide insights to market participants for the development of cross-regional trading or risk management strategies in the Australian NEM. As the Australian Energy Regulator considers building <b>new</b> <b>interconnectors</b> to facilitate regional market integration, our findings regarding connectedness of regional markets through the applied spillover measures also provide important quantitative information to NEM policy makers.

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with the}} Norwegian transmission system operator, Statnett, and their research on two <b>new</b> <b>interconnectors</b> linking Norway to England and Germany. The work presented in this thesis has considered one of these interconnectors, with a third terminal connected offshore to allow for integration of offshore wind power and oil platforms, as shown in fig. ~ref{fig:theGrid}. Investigation of the voltage source converters (VSCs) control ability as well as operational aspects of multi-terminal DC-grids has been performed. Identified as the key control variable of a DC-grid is the DC-voltage serving as a measure of power balance, since an unbalance will affect the DC-voltage through charging or discharging of the DC-capacitances. Utilizing VSCs allowing a fast and accurate control of the DC-voltage can lead to a stable operation of a DC-grid. The three-terminal structure, fig. ~ref{fig:theGrid}, was implemented in the simulation tool SIMPOW and connected to a 35 -node AC-grid model representing the Nordic grid. The simulation model was used for analyzes of the DC-grid operation and its affect on the connected AC-grids. The converter station connected to the Nordic grid were applied with DC-voltage control, implying that it will act as the power balancing unit of the DC-grid. The simulations performed show that the control structure implemented could assure a stable DC-grid operation within 0. 3 s of a fault. It identified the need for a fast response to changes in the DC-voltage as the influence of the other connected AC-grids were directly linked to DC-voltage oscillations. Simulations were also conducted to study the advantage of applying AC-voltage control compared to reactive power for the converter connected to the Nordic grid. It was identified that an increased stability of the Nordic grid could be assured during faults in the grid itself. This also affected the DC-grid operation through an increased capability of power exchange with the Nordic grid. </p...|$|E

Operating an interconnector below its maximum transfer limit can enable the interconnector(s) to remain connected following a larger contingency size, which decreases the risk of separation, but this can reduce available market benefits. A new frequency control system protection scheme (FCSPS) is being applied to mitigate the effects of a credible contingency and optimizing the import and export capability of the Tasmania Basslink interconnector with very positive results [9]. The scheme continuously monitors the interconnector flow, and system load demand over 4 s cycle and calculates the required load or generation tripping that is necessary to mitigate the contingent loss of the interconnector. Loads or generators are tripped within hundreds of milliseconds of protection clearance time to allow system frequency to be maintained within the operational frequency tolerance band limits, even though Basslink could be operating at up to 630  MW export or 478  MW import.|$|R

40|$|The {{long-term}} European Union (EU) {{energy policy}} increasingly requires member countries to reform existing power systems, {{including those of}} small island states. These are commonly isolated electricity systems that rely heavily on imported fossil fuels. Interconnections with mainland power systems are an alternative to offset the exposure to volatile fuel prices. This paper studies the 200 -MW (MW) subsea transmission cable between the EU island member state of Malta and Sicily that was inaugurated on April 2015. Our main purpose is to examine whether {{and to what extent}} Malta's vulnerability to distinct oil price scenarios can be overcome with this <b>new</b> <b>interconnector.</b> We describe the process used to simulate the merit order for both Malta's isolated and interconnected electric generation setup. The algorithm used provides the average electricity spot price and economic scarcity rent of electricity im- ports and exports. The main finding is that the Malta-Sicily interconnector does not necessarily lower electricity prices for Malta's consumers. However, some scenarios, notably the incorporation of natural gas in Malta's future generation portfolio, achieve winewin situations for both consumer and supplier.

40|$|Master in the Electric Power IndustryIn {{light of}} European {{electricity}} market liberalization this master‘s thesis addresses the envisaged grid interconnection – a high voltage subsea cable with 200 megawatt transmission capacity – {{between the two}} EU member states Malta and Italy. So far, Malta‘s electric power system has been isolated and therefore electricity supply in the small European island state has heavily relied on imported fossil fuels. Consequently, Malta‘s exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices inherently impedes to reliably predict electricity generation costs. This motivates to investigate whether and to what degree the vulnerability to distinct oil price scenarios can be overcome with the <b>new</b> <b>interconnector</b> {{that is expected to}} be operational as of 2014 / 2015. Generally, an isolated power system like in Malta implies peculiarities. This master paper thoroughly examines whether the interconnection cable to Sicily breaks up the Maltese market and potentially threatens the privileges of the incumbent utility Enemalta. It presents the drivers that have forced the small EU member state to radically revise its hitherto energy policy. Primarily our Malta-Sicily case study i.) discusses the cable‘s qualitative implications – in particular institutional challenges – and ii.) numerically determines potential consequences for Maltese electricity consumers. Our numerical sensitivity analysis defines the merit order for both Malta‘s isolated and the future generation setup differentiating between three distinct oil price scenarios. Based on the constructed marginal cost curves, we then simulate the interconnection case. Malta‘s quantity imports and the cable‘s total capacity utilization indicator are two key findings. Moreover, the algorithm enables to determine the average electricity spot price with interconnector and the computation of rents for both the supplier and cable owner. Our analysis demonstrates that the submarine interconnector does not inherently reduce the electricity price level for Maltese consumers. It thus renders whether and in which of the presented generation setups and distinct oil price scenarios Malta‘s interconnected power system benefits. The study concludes that the cable‘s impact significantly depends on the considered generation setup, the oil price scenario and the market design. In sum, this thesis simulates how the theoretical concept of market liberalization practically applies to the EU island‘s micro power system. Its added value originates from both a qualitative and quantitative analysis which shows that the cable‘s impact for Maltese end consumers is importantly co-determined by Enemalta‘s future positioning. Although the link will certainly promote the creation of a single European electricity market, this paper suggests to thoroughly rethink infras...|$|R
