40|$|We {{theoretically}} investigate dynamic <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>polarization</b> in a self-assembled {{quantum dot}} pumped optically by two laser beams. With {{the assumption that}} a noncollinear interaction between the hole spin and nuclear spins leads to <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>polarization,</b> we find that both weak and strong <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>polarizations</b> can arise, depending on the intensities and central frequencies of the lasers. For weak <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>polarization,</b> we use a perturbation method {{to show that the}} distribution of the nuclear spin Overhauser field may become significantly narrower.

25|$|Detected as {{enhanced}} absorptive or emissive {{signals in}} the NMR spectra {{of the reaction}} products, CIDNP has been exploited for the last 30 years to characterise transient free radicals and their reaction mechanisms. In certain cases, CIDNP also offers the possibility of large improvements in NMR sensitivity. The principal application of this photo-CIDNP technique, as devised by Kaptein in 1978, has been to proteins in which the aromatic amino acid residues histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine can be polarized using flavins or other aza-aromatics as photosensitisers. The key feature of the method is that only solvent accessible histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine residues can undergo the radical pair reactions that result in <b>nuclear</b> <b>polarization.</b> Photo-CIDNP has thus been used to probe the surface structure of proteins, both in native and partially folded states, and their interactions with molecules that modify the accessibility of the reactive side chains.|$|E

2500|$|MRI has the {{advantages}} of having very high spatial resolution and is very adept at morphological imaging and functional imaging. [...] MRI does have several disadvantages though. [...] First, MRI has a sensitivity of around 10−3 mol/L [...] to 10−5 mol/L, which, compared to other types of imaging, can be very limiting. [...] This problem {{stems from the fact}} that the population difference between the nuclear spin states is very small at room temperature. [...] For example, at 1.5 teslas, a typical field strength for clinical MRI, the difference between high and low energy states is approximately 9 molecules per 2 million. Improvements to increase MR sensitivity include increasing magnetic field strength, and hyperpolarization via optical pumping or dynamic <b>nuclear</b> <b>polarization.</b> There are also a variety of signal amplification schemes based on chemical exchange that increase sensitivity.|$|E

Moreover, highly polarized discharges in gaseous helium can be used as sources of polarized beams of atomic or molecular ions or electrons. Some progress has been made recently to obtain higher <b>nuclear</b> <b>polarizations</b> in gaseous 3 He at a higher density. Laser optical pumping can produce polarizations over 60 % or more in a gas at room temperature. This can be combined with a polarization transfer technique, in which a laser is used to pump 3 He in a cell at room temperature, while another cell at a few degrees Kelvin is polarized by diffusion of the atoms through a long connecting tube. Cryogenic coatings, made of solid hydrogen frozen on the coldest parts of the inside wall of the container, reduce very effectively the fast nuclear relaxation which would occur on bare pyrex walls at low temperatures. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>polarizations</b> of the order of 50 % have been obtained in a relatively dense gas (n ~ 10 ^ 18 cm- 3) at T <= 4 K.
