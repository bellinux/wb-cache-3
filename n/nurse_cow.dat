Increased animal welfare and health were the focus of system development, but the practical and economic feasibility of the rearing system also received attention. Farmers implementing a suckling system aim to raise well-developed dairy cows that fit easily into the dairy herd and are adapted to the existing farming conditions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} <b>nurse</b> <b>cow’s</b> behaviour during the calves rearing. The experimental group consisted of five Holstein – Friesian <b>nurse</b> <b>cows.</b> The experiment takes 10 weeks of each circle. The calves were allotted to the <b>nurse</b> <b>cows</b> immediately after calving in the first circles. In the first circle was used 1 own calf and 2 foster calves in comparison with the second circle where were 3 foster calves. The calves were with <b>nurse</b> <b>cows</b> in the separate “habitual pen ” during the first week of rearing. We made 24 hours lasting etiological observations. During etiological observation we evaluated the following activities: “Lying”, “Eating”, “Standing”, “Walking”, “Drinking”, “Licking calf”, “Standing and bellowing”, “Smelling calf”, “Sucking ” and “Head knocking”. Our results show that the activity of “standing and bellowing ” did not occur in the first circle in comparison with the volume 57, 40 minutes in the second circle.

Milk yield at milking during the 9 wk of nursing was lower in <b>nursing</b> <b>cows</b> compared with control cows (26. 1 +/- 1. 0 vs. 35. 5 +/- 1. 1 kg) that were only machine milked. During nursing, the amount drunk by calves increased from 6. 5 +/- 0. 7 kg/d on wk 1 to 12. 5 +/- 1. 4 kg/d on wk 9. When this {{was added to the}} amount of milk obtained at milking, <b>nursing</b> <b>cows</b> did not differ from control cows in total milk produced (35. 5 +/- 1. 0 vs. 35. 5 +/- 1. 0 kg).

During the 6 wk after weaning, milk production was the same for the <b>nursing</b> and control <b>cows</b> (34. 0 +/- 1. 35 vs. 34. 7 +/- 1. 42 kg). Plasma oxytocin levels during milking were greater for control <b>cows</b> than for <b>nursing</b> <b>cows</b> (31. 7 +/- 5. 4 vs. 18. 0 +/- 2. 8 pg/mL), but were equivalent to concentrations in <b>nursing</b> <b>cows</b> during <b>nursing</b> (35. 5 +/- 7. 5 pg/mL).

40|$|Abstract - Maternal {{behaviour}} {{and contact}} between {{cow and calf}} is limited or absent in modern dairy systems due to the wide use of bucket feeding. This {{is also the case}} in organic dairy systems. An increasing number of individual farmers are not satisfied with the artificial bucket feeding system. In order to improve the welfare of their dairy cattle, a number of organic farms introduced suckling systems. On the dairy farms that make use of a suckling system calves are suckled by their mother or a <b>nurse</b> <b>cow,</b> for a duration that ranges from three days up to three months. We evaluated on-farm the growth and production of calves reared in a bucket feeding system or a suckling system. Suckling systems make better use of the growing potential of calves in the first months of their lives. A high weaning weight may result in a lower age at first calving and a higher weight at calving. Higher bodyweight at calving also has a positive effect on milk production in the first lactation. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{introduction}} of suckling systems in organic dairy calf rearing {{has the potential}} to enhance animal welfare in terms of ‘natural living’ and to live up to consumers' expectations about organic agriculture. This study describes the implications of suckling systems in a practical organic dairy context. Results show that farmers can successfully develop and implement a suckling system in calf rearing. The consumption of mothers' milk resulted in high weaning weights at 3 months of age. No immediate animal health problems linked to suckling systems occurred. Compared with traditional bucket feeding of milk, suckling systems resulted in increased natural behaviour such as calf-cow bonding, natural sucking behaviour and care-taking behaviour. Some farmers had difficulties accepting negative implications of suckling systems such as stress after weaning and loss of marketable milk. Although suckling of the own mother was seen as the most natural suckling system, farmers adapted their suckling system to calves suckling <b>nurse</b> <b>cows.</b> In order to implement successfully a suckling system, farmers have to step back from control and give calf and cow a chance. In the case of increasing ‘natural living’ through implementation of a suckling system, farmers should be encouraged to take enough time to accomplish this attitude change...|$|R

Median morbidity rate in outbreak herds was 1. 85 per 100 sheep-month at risk and 0. 32 per 100 cattle-month at risk for sheep and cattle, respectively. The mean proportion of BT-affected animals in outbreak herds that recovered from clinical disease was approximately eight times higher for cattle compared to sheep in the Netherlands.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the dairy}} {{industry}} {{it is common}} practice to separate cow and calf shortly after birth but this practice is disputed because of animal welfare concerns. Some producers, in many countries, milk <b>cows</b> that also <b>nurse</b> dairy calves. These cow–calf systems allow nursing as well as affiliative and other natural behaviours. In this review paper we describe cow–calf systems used in practice and/or in research, discuss the benefits and challenges documented by research, and identify areas where more research is needed. Four cow–calf systems are described: (1) free contact systems where cow and calf have unrestricted access to each other; (2) restricted suckling systems allowing short daily contact only to nurse; (3) half day contact where cow and calf are housed together during the day or night; and (4) foster cow systems where one <b>cow</b> <b>nurses</b> 2 – 4 calves usually without milking. In free and half day cow–calf contact systems the calf drinks large amounts of milk and has high daily weight gains. High pre-weaning calf weight gains {{have been shown to}} lead to higher milk yield during that animal's first lactation. One issue with cow–calf systems is the depressed weight gain of calves at weaning. The premature separation of cow and calf, compared to the natural situation, may cause stress especially in free contact systems. Weaning and separation should therefore occur in two steps. Half day contact seems particularly promising because animals get used to being separated, they experience positive human handling, and calves can learn to use a milk feeder which will prevent the growth check following weaning. <b>Nursing</b> <b>cows</b> yield less saleable milk during the suckling period, can have problems with milk ejection during machine milking and have a lower fat content of the milk, compared to non-nursing cows. Udder health of the cow may be positively affected by nursing. A rich social rearing environment has recently been shown to improve cognitive skills of calves. Still, studies on long term effects of dam rearing on behaviour, health, production and farm economics are few. There is also a need to address ways to control transmissible diseases when dairy cattle are kept in mixed age groups. Increased knowledge will help us design functional high tech dairy management systems that respect the natural behaviour of cows and calves during the calf rearing period...|$|R

In this study, herd brucellosis and bovine genital campylobacteriosis (BGC) status, and demographic and management variables were determined and related to predicted calving rate (PrCR) of cattle herds in Adamawa, Kaduna and Kano states, Nigeria. Serum samples, preputial scrapings, questionnaire data, trans-rectal palpation and farm records were used from 271 herds. The Rose-Bengal plate test and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used for Brucella serology and culture and identification from preputial samples for BGC. A herd was classified as positive if one or more animals tested positive. The PrCR was determined {{as the number of}} calvings expected during the previous 6 and next 6 months {{as a percentage of the}} number of postpubertal heifers and cows in the herd. A multilevel linear regression model was used to estimate the herd-level effect of Brucella abortus seropositivity, Campylobacter fetus infection and other factors on calculated PrCR. RESULTS : The reproductive performance of the cattle herds was generally poor: Only 6. 5 % of the <b>nursing</b> <b>cows</b> were pregnant and 51. 1 % were non-pregnant and acyclic; the mean annual PrCR was 51. 4 %. Brucella abortus and C. fetus infection of herds were independently associated with absolute reduction in PrCR of 14. 9 % and 8. 4 %, respectively. There was also a strong negative association between within-herd Brucella seroprevalence and PrCR. Presence of small ruminants, animal introduction without quarantine and the presence of handling facilities were associated with lower PrCR, whereas larger herd size, supplementary feeding, routine mineral supplementation and care during parturition were associated with higher PrCR. CONCLUSIONS : Brucellosis and BGC may be largely responsible for the poor reproductive performance of indigenous Nigerian cattle.

40|$|Many Sandhills cow-calf {{operations}} rely on hay {{produced from}} subirrigated meadows {{as a primary}} source of winter and spring forage. Grazing these meadows in the spring, rather than holding them exclusively for hay production, may improve ranch efficiency and profitability. Cattle were {{assigned to one of}} 4 treatments: graze meadow or be fed hay during a prebreeding period (May) then graze meadow or graze upland range during the breeding period (June–July) in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Stocking rates for meadow pastures were 3. 2 AUM ha − 1, 4. 4 AUM ha− 1, and 6. 0 AUM ha − 1, respectively, for pastures grazed prebreeding only, prebreeding + breeding, and breeding only. Hay harvest from May and May–July grazed meadow was half that of the non-grazed hay meadow (2, 000 kg ha− 1 vs. 4, 000 kg ha− 1, P = 0. 001) but total DM harvest from grazing and haying combined were similar for the May grazed pastures and non-grazed hay meadow (P 3 ̆e 0. 10). Total CP harvest was greater for the May grazed treatments than for non-grazed hay meadow (600 kg ha− 1 vs. 350 kg ha− 1 P = 0. 05). Body condition score of cows grazing meadow during the prebreeding period increased more (P = 0. 06) between May and October than that of cows fed hay during the prebreeding period. Management had no effect on pregnancy rate or calving interval (P 3 ̆e 0. 10). Calves grazing meadow during the prebreeding period gained 11 kg more than hay-fed groups by weaning (P = 0. 03). Utilizing spring meadow grazing together with winter grazing may spare nearly 0. 5 ha meadow cow− 1 and nearly 130 cow− 1 in feeding expenses annually. Additional gain of calves that had <b>nursed</b> <b>cows</b> grazing meadow during the prebreeding period was worth 21 hd− 1. Cost of feeding cows in the 60 days between calving and the start of the breeding season was reduced by nearly 30 hd− 1 by replacing low quality hay and supplement feeding with high quality meadow hay and May grazing. We conclude that spring grazing Sandhills meadows can be effective in increasing profitability of spring calving cow-calf enterprises. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary mission}} of a beef brood cow is to {{consistently}} produce calves. There are numerous management practices designed to assist cows in accomplishing this mission.

40|$|Behavioural {{observation}} {{was made}} on a herd of 6 dehorned Japanese Black Cows and their calves during 3 consecutive days (0900 - 1700 h, exclusive of 1500 - 1530 h) to investigate the cow-calf relationships and the social interactions between cows within the herd when kept together in a dry-lot. The intensive nursing incidents and maternal lickings occurred between 0900 and 1000 h and between 1530 and 1700 h. It appeared that such a relatively high-level behavioural synchronization was related to feed delivery time. The average number of <b>nursing</b> events per <b>cow</b> was 5. 1; the average time spent nursing 32. 2 min; the average nursing time per bout 7. 9 min and {{the average number of}} maternal lickings 10. 4. Older calves suckled less frequently, spent relatively less time suckling and more suckling time per bout. Dams of older calves also licked their own calves less frequently. Cows had a significantly higher frequency of lickings toward their own calves than that toward other cows (P=O. O 5). A total of 35 interruptions of nursing (vs 92 nursing events) induced by agonistic encounters between dams ujas observed. Interrupted nursing occurred more frequently between 1400 and 1500 h. There was a close negative association between social order and the number of interrupted nursings (r=- 0. 966, P <O. Ol), suggesting that cows lower in the order suffered more interruptions of nursing and their calves were in relatively stressful condition...|$|R
40|$|Two {{nutritional}} levels following parturition {{and five}} weaning ages for the calf were evaluated to study their effect of reproduction in Gyr cows in the savannas of West Central Brazil (Campos Cerrados). Early weaning of calves reduced postpartum weight losses and shortened the postpartum interval to conception. Energy level {{did not affect}} cow weight at weaning or conception, {{the number of days}} from parturition to first estrus or the number of matings/conception; however, the postpartum period to conception was reduced (116 vs 160 d; P less than. 05) for cows on the higher energy diet. Weaning age significantly affected postpartum weight loss in cows. Six months after calving, <b>cows</b> that <b>nursed</b> calves for 1 mo were 89 kg heavier than those that nursed calves for 6 mo (384 vs 295 kg; P less than. 05). <b>Cows</b> that were <b>nursed</b> for 1 mo returned to estrus at an average of 40 d postpartum, which was 23 d earlier (P less than. 05) than the average of the other groups nursed for longer periods of time. There {{was no significant difference in}} the postpartum period to conception among cows that had their calves weaned at 1 mo, 3 mo and <b>cows</b> which were <b>nursed</b> twice daily beginning 30 d after parturition (57, 94 and 97 d, respectively), but was less (P less than. 05) for <b>cows</b> <b>nursed</b> for 5 or 6 mo (212 and 231 d, respectively). The results show that Gyr cattle are genetically capable of responding reproductively to improve nutrition and reduced lactation stress achieved through early weaning or controlled nursing.

40|$|Lactation and {{weaning weight}} {{relationships}} were studied in 37 cows grazing Southern Utah irrigated pastures {{during the summer}} of 1979. The herd included 23 Hereford cows ranging in age from 2 to 12 years and 14 Simmental-Hereford half-blood cows aged 3 to 9 years. The suckling calves were sired by Hereford bulls. The average daily milk yield of 6. 16 kg was affected by the cow breed. Simmental-Hereford cows produced 7. 11 kg of milk per day, while the Herefords produced 5. 21 kg per day. Milk production declined with increased days in lactation. The decline was linear in the Simmental- Hereford cows and quadratic in the Herefords. Milk production was also affected by the sex of the suckling calf. Heifer calves received 6. 44 kg per day compared t o 5. 80 kg per day for bull calves. Calf birth weight and test day weight influenced milk yield as <b>cows</b> <b>nursing</b> heavier calves produced more milk. Cow breed affected milk composition. Simmental-Hereford cows had higher percent solids-not-fat, while Herefords were higher for percent protein. Calf weights were affected by sex of calf. Bull calves weighed 33. 89 kg at birth, while heifers weighed 32. 14 kg. At weaning, bulls weighed 188. 63 kg, while heifers weighed 177. 14 kg. While no breed difference was evident for birth weight, calves from Simmental-Hereford dams weighed more over the duration of the study than calves from Hereford dams. The difference between the mean 205 -day adjusted weights for the calves from the Simmental-Hereford and Hereford cows was 24. 96 kg (230. 50 kg and 205. 54 kg, respectively). Milk yield was highly correlated to calf gain (r 0. 71). The breed of dam influence upon weaning weight was largely a result of differences. in quantity of milk produced...|$|R
40|$|The {{parasitic}} mite, Demodex bovis, causes demodectic mange in cattle. Calves probably {{become infected}} {{during the first}} few days of <b>nursing</b> from infected <b>cows.</b> Poor nutrition, stress and the presence of other infections may contribute to the susceptibility of cattle to demodex outbreaks. This susceptibility may also be genetically determined. This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of SCAVON VET (The Himalaya Drug Company, Bangalore, India,) spray, a polyherbal formulation in the treatment of demodectic mange in calf. Case history and clinical observations Three months old Holstein Freshen calf was presented with a history of hair fall and redened skin color. Clinical examination revealed scaly, wrinkled, thickened skin, hair fall and a change in skin colour from its normal color to red, and bruises on the face and hind limbs. The case was tentatively diagnosed as demodectic mange and was confirmed by finding the mite during microscopic examination of deep skin scrapings of the affected area. Treatment and result The infected area was cleaned with potassium permanganate solution (Venugopalan, 1995) and wiped dry with sterile cotton, SCAVON VET spray was applied twice a day liberally over the surface of the infected area for 15 days. The calf showed recovery in 15 days without any complications. Observations indicated that SCAVON VET spray minimized the demodectic mange in calf by about 60 % by 8 days, 80 % by 10 days and 100 % by 15 days. Recurrence was not seen in a follow-up period of 1 week. The herbal ingredients in SCAVON VET spray namely Eucalyptus globules (Tailapatra), Azadirachta indica (Nimba), Andropogon citratus (Bhutrina), Curcuma longa (Haridra) and Cedrus deodara (Devadaru) are known to be antibacterial,antimycotic (Grover and Rao, 1977) and are also known to possess insecticidal, antiseptic and wound healing properties (Satyavati et al., 1976) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Research was {{conducted}} on the Keating rangelands in north-eastern Oregon to determine the food habits of deer and cattle and similarity of their diets, and to estimate deer and cattle months of grazing on both a quantitative and nutritional basis. Data were collected during the winters of 1978 - 1979, 1979 - 1980 and during the spring and fall of 1979 and 1980. In the Crystal Palace, Tucker Creek and Spring Creek study areas, field fecal collections were made and the microhistological method was used in the laboratory to determine the food habits of both deer and cattle. Similarity indices were calculated comparing food habits of both deer and cattle. In delineated plant communities, available herbaceous forage was estimated within 0. 5 m² circular plots employing a double sampling technique, and available browse was estimated employing a multiple linear regression technique. Subsamples of available forage were analyzed for in vitro dry matter digestibility and crude protein. An extensive literature review {{was conducted}} to determine nitrogen (N) and metabolizable energy (ME) requirements of both deer and cattle. Cattle and deer months of grazing were calculated for each plant community on a quantitative (i. e., forage biomass) and nutritional (i. e., metabolizable energy and nitrogen) basis employing the resources available following relationships: number supported = resources available/resources required. Management recommendations were made based on data collected in this study. Grass was the most dominant forage consumed by cattle, while deer consumed both grass and browse. Forbs were not an important dietary constituent for either cattle or deer. During the early winter period of 1978 - 1979, browse and grass averaged 57. 4 percent and 1. 6 percent of the deer diets, respectively. However, during the late winter period of 1978 - 1979, browse and grass averaged 40. 2 percent and 31. 5 percent of the deer diets, respectively. During the 1979 - 1980 winter, browse and grass averaged 35. 4 percent and 51. 9 percent of the deer diets, respectively. The predominant grass and browse consumed by deer was Sandberg's bluegrass and big sagebrush, respectively. During the spring period, crested wheatgrass, cheatgrass and Sandberg's bluegrass averaged 21. 8, 29. 1 and 19. 5 percent of cattle diets, respectively. During the fall period,. cheatgrass and Sandberg's bluegrass averaged 30. 4 and 24. 9 percent of cattle diets, respectively. Diet similarity ranged from 27. 1 percent to 52. 8 percent while the average spring overlap for both years was 37 percent and the average fall overlap was 50 percent. Most of the dietary overlap occurred on Sandberg's bluegrass. The literature review revealed that on a forage biomass basis a cow-calf pair in spring required 14 kg/day, while a dry pregnant cow in the fall required 10 kg/day. On an energy and nitrogen basis, a <b>nursing</b> <b>cow</b> required 26. 6 Meal/day of ME and 206 g of N, while a dry pregnant cow required 10. 0 Meal/day of ME and 94. 5 g of N. On a forage biomass basis, a wintering adult deer required. 9 kg of forage per day while a fawn required. 6 kg per day. Considering the length of the winter period, the energy obtained by catabolism of fat, and the energy and nitrogen required in gesta tion, I determined that during the early and late winter periods of 1978 - 1979 deer required 1. 81 and 1. 80 Meal/day of ME and during the 1979 - 1980 winter, they required 1. 73 Meal/day of ME. The literature also revealed that a wintering deer required 12. 9 g of N per day. Quantitative forage analysis showed that depending upon study area and pasture on a kg/ha basis the predominant grasses available to cattle were crested wheatgrass, Sandberg's bluegrass and cheatgrass. Determination of available browse biomass was made employing a multiple linear regression model for mountain big sagebrush (log y = - 6. 37 +. 9337 log H + 1. 49 log W₂), and a simple linear regression model for gray rabbitbrush (log y = - 3. 70 + 1. 81 log W) and basin big sagebrush (log y = - 3. 84 +. 9870 log A). Depending upon study area and plant community, quantitative analysis of the forage showed that big sagebrush and Sandberg's bluegrass were the dominant species available to deer. Early spring grazed pastures could carry more AUMS on a nutritional basis than on a quantitative basis. Pastures sampled in late spring showed that total AUMS on a forage quantity basis exceeded those on a nutritional basis. During the fall on an old-growth (i. e., previous year's growth) and fall growth basis, total AUMS based on N generally exceeded those based on ME or forage quantity, except in the crested wheatgrass-dominated pasture where more AUMS were calculated on a quantity basis than on a nutritional basis. On a fall-growth-only basis, more AUMS were calculated on a nutritional basis than on a quantity basis. Generally, the least number of AUMS could be carried on the medusahead communities while the most AUMS could be carried on the crested wheatgrass seedings. Deer months calculated for the two winters across the three study areas showed more deer months per plant community were calculated on a forage quantity basis than on an ME or N basis. However, an exception to this trend occurred in the grassland com munities where more deer months were calculated on an N basis than on an ME or forage quantity basis. Generally, the most deer months were calculated for the basin big sagebrush communities while the least number of deer months were calculated on the medusahead communities...|$|R
