50|$|Chapin {{described}} the broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> as Steganura aucupum obtusa from Luchenza in 1922. Previously, Vidua obtusa, V. interjecta, V. orientalis, V. paradisaea and V. togoensis {{were considered to}} be in the same species, and these five species are sometimes placed in the genus Steganura. The broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> is a monotypic species.|$|R
50|$|This whydah {{is found}} in Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, with an {{estimated}} distribution size of 5060000 km2. Approximately half of the range overlaps with {{the range of the}} long-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah.</b> The broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah's</b> habitat is woodlands, including miombo and Baikiaea plurijuga woodland, and also acacia savannas.|$|R
5000|$|The broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> is a brood parasite, {{its host}} being the orange-winged pytilia (Pytilia afra). The host species only weighs 14 - 15 g {{and is thus}} at a disadvantage. It mimics the host species's call. It feeds {{on the ground in}} small flocks, eating seeds. When the broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> is not breeding, it may mix with the long-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah.</b> Breeding plumage has been {{observed}} from February to July in the southeastern Congo Basin. The eggs are white, weighing approximately 1.6 g. Newborn chicks have loose greyish down, very similar to chicks of the orange-winged pytilia. The incubation period and nestling period are unknown. Irruptions can occur; in 1994, an [...] "invasion" [...] of thousands of whydahs was reported in Kasane, Botswana.|$|R
50|$|Widespread {{throughout}} its large range, the long-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|R
50|$|The long-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> or eastern <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> (Vidua paradisaea) is a {{small brown}} sparrow-like bird of Eastern Africa, from eastern South Sudan to {{southern}} Angola. During the breeding season the male moults into breeding plumage that consists of a black head and back, rusty brown breast, bright yellow nape, and buffy white abdomen with broad, elongated black tail feathers up to 36 cm long (approximately three times the length of its body). Males and females are almost indistinguishable outside of the breeding season.|$|R
50|$|The Togo <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> (Vidua togoensis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Viduidae.It is found in Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Togo.|$|R
50|$|It is a brood {{parasite}} to the green-winged pytilia. Male long-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydahs</b> {{imitate the}} song of the male green-winged pytilia. The whydah chicks are larger and louder than the host chicks, so the foster parents will give them more attention than their own chicks.|$|R
50|$|The broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> (Vidua obtusa) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Viduidae. It is found {{woodland}} and acacia savanna habitat in Sub-Saharan Africa from Angola to Uganda, Tanzania and Mozambique. A brood parasite, it has a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being of least concern.|$|R
50|$|Vidua orientalis {{has often}} been {{considered}} a subspecies of eastern <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah,</b> Vidua paradisea, since both birds parasitise the green-winged pytilia, Pytilia melba, a common species of estrildid finch. However, the finch has two subspecies, nominate melba and citerior, which are sometimes treated as separate species. The ranges of these two taxa correspond well to those of V.paradisea and V. orientalis.|$|R

50|$|The Sahel <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> {{does not}} build its own nests, but parasitises the green-winged pytilia, Pytilia melba, a common species of estrildid finch. These birds do not destroy the host green-winged pytilia's eggs, but they deposit their own {{eggs in the}} nests of their hosts, adding them to those already present. As in other whydah species to attract hens the songs of the males mimic the song of their hosts. These birds are not monogamous pairs, in fact males breed with many females. In a {{breeding}} season females may lay about 22 eggs, that hatch after 12-13 days of incubation. The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain.|$|R
50|$|The orange-winged pytilia {{is found}} in small flocks, and can form larger, looser flocks {{when it is not}} breeding. It feeds on the ground, eating seeds and {{probably}} also insects. In the non-breeding season, it can move great distances to find food. Its call is seee, and its song is quickly repeated whistles. The orange-winged pytilia is parasitised by the broad-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah,</b> which mimics its call. The orange-winged pytilia's breeding season is April to May in the southeastern Congo Basin, January to May in Zambia and Zimbabwe, March to June in Malawi, and April to June in Tanzania. The eggs weigh approximately 1.42 g, and those of the brood parasite weigh about 15% more, at 1.64 g. The pytilia's incubation period is 12 to 13 days, and the nestling period is 21 days.|$|R
5000|$|There are [...] "69 {{species of}} mammal, 327 species of birds, 7 species of reptile, 493 {{species of plants}} and 92 species of fish". Planning for the {{conservation}} and management of wildlife in Gambela Park was focused on protecting three endangered species: the African elephant, Nile lechwe and shoebill stork. Among the mammal species reported to be living here are the Cape buffalo, Masai lion, leopard, Sudan cheetah, Nubian giraffe, roan antelope, tiang, Lelwel hartebeest, olive baboon, and guereza monkey, as well as hyena, buffalo, sable antelope, hippopotamus, Kafue lechwe, zebra, greater kudu, bushbuck, oribi, reedbuck and waterbuck. The peak of the annual antelope migration occurs from January to March. Several birds only found in this area include the long-tailed <b>paradise</b> <b>whydah</b> and the red-throated and green bee-eaters.|$|R

5000|$|All are obligate brood parasites, {{which lay}} their eggs in the nests of estrildid finch species; most indigobirds use firefinches as hosts, whereas the <b>paradise</b> <b>whydahs</b> chose pytilias. Unlike the cuckoos and honeyguides, the indigobirds and whydahs do not destroy the host's eggs. Typically, they lay 2 - 4 eggs in with those already present. The eggs of both the host and the victim are white, {{although}} the indigobird's are slightly larger. Many of the indigo-plumaged species named [...] "indigobirds" [...] are very similar in appearance, with the males difficult to separate in the field, and the young and females near impossible. The best guide is often the estrildid finch {{with which they are}} associating, since each indigobird parasitises a different host species. For example, the village indigobird is usually found with red-billed firefinches. Indigobirds and whydahs imitate their host's song, which the males learn in the nest. Although females do not sing, they also learn to recognise the song, and choose males with the same song, thus perpetuating the link between each species of indigobird and firefinch. The nestling indigobirds mimic the unique gape pattern of the fledglings of the host species.|$|R

The light trees bordering the viewing {{area and the}} bay include speakers, bubble machines, infrared transmitters {{and a handful of}} VariLite lighting fixtures. On either side of the bay, there is an additional light tree with five Syncrolite fixtures. The viewing area, known as Paradise Lagoon Amphitheater, is situated along the <b>northern</b> shore of <b>Paradise</b> Bay, and can hold up to 4,000 spectators at full capacity. It is multi-tiered, similar to the viewing area for Fantasmic at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. It features trellises, flowers, and an interactive play fountain during the day. Hidden fountains located in the flower beds in the viewing area are incorporated into show. When World of Color Celebrate was being programmed, a large scrim shaped like Mickeys head was added to be raised to cover the face on Mickeys Fun Wheel giving the show another projection surface. On nights where winds are too strong, the scrim is not pulled up and some projections seen on the Fun Wheel head show up on Screamin's loop area instead. The fountains on the flower beds in the viewing area were replaced by smoke shooters and additional shooters were placed {{on the edge of the}} viewing area on the water. Each shooter has their own LED light rings like the fountains do.|$|R
40|$|A 9. 3 -year dataset of low-tide time-exposure {{images from}} Surfers <b>Paradise,</b> <b>Northern</b> Gold Coast, Australia {{was used to}} characterise the state {{dynamics}} of a double sandbar system. The morphology of the nearshore sandbars was described {{by means of the}} sequential bar state classification scheme of Wright and Short [1984. Morphodynamic variability of surf zones and beaches: a synthesis. Marine Geology 56, 93 – 118]. Besides the two end members (the dissipative (D) and the reflective (R) states) and the four intermediate states (longshore bar and trough (LBT), rhythmic bar and beach (RBB), transverse bar and rip (TBR) and low tide terrace (LTT)), we identified two additional intermediate bar states. The erosive transverse bar and rip (eTBR) state related to the dominant oblique angle of wave incidence at the study site and the rhythmic low tide terrace (rLTT) related to the multiple bar setting. Using the alongshore barline variability and alongshore trough continuity as morphological indicators enabled the objective classification of the inner and outer bar states from the images. The outer bar was mostly in the TBR state and generally advanced sequentially through the states LBT–RBB–TBR–eTBR–LBT, with occasional transitions to the D state. Wave events led to abrupt state transitions of the outer bar, but, in contrast to expectations, did not necessarily correspond to upstate transitions. Instead, upstate (downstate) transitions coincided with angles of wave incidence θ larger (smaller) than 30 °. The upstate TBR–eTBR–LBT sequence during high-angle events highlights the role of alongshore currents in bar straightening. The outer bar was found to govern the state of the inner bar to a large extent. Two types of inner bar behaviour were distinguished, based on the outer bar state. For intermediate outer bar states, the alongshore variability of the dominant inner rLTT state (52 % in time) mainly related to that of the outer bar, implying some sort of morphological coupling. For dissipative outer bar states, however, the more upstate inner bar frequently separated from the shoreline and persistently developed rip channels as TBR became the most frequent state (60 % in time) ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{international}} tourism as {{an analytical}} and ethnographic entry, this study explores the intricate {{ways in which}} local to global processes intersect, overlap, and clash. Destina-tions worldwide are adapting themselves to the homogenizing standards of global tour-ism {{while at the same}} time trying to maintain, or even increase, their local distinctiveness. Central to these deeply intertwined processes are tourism imaginaries, understood as rep-resentational systems that mediate reality and form identities, and their (re) production by local tour guides, key agents in the selling and telling of natural and cultural heritage. Drawing on 25 months of multi-sited and multi-temporal fieldwork in Yogyakarta, Indone-sia, and Arusha, Tanzania, this study addresses the following issues: (1) the representation of peoples and places in globally circulating tourism imaginaries; (2) the perceived, offi-cially sanctioned, and actual roles of local tour guides in this representational practice; (3) the formal schooling and informal learning of guides to appropriate images and dis-courses of tourism; (4) the (re) production and contestation of fashionable tourism imagery in guiding narratives and practices; and (5) the ways in which dominant imaginaries and personal imaginations of tourism stakeholders are (dis) connected. The methodology used, labeled as glocal ethnography, involves a mixed-methods approach including extensive observation, interviews, questionnaires, and the collection of secondary data. The com-parative and discourse-centered analysis of the data reveals how local guides in Yogya-karta and Arusha act as “mechanics of glocalization”, assuring the continued circulation and localization of tourism fantasies, but also using the encounter with foreigners to fo-ment their own imaginations of “paradise on earth” and to accumulate cosmopolitan knowledge. These findings add not only to the current theorizing on tour guiding and tourism, they demonstrate the potential of glocal ethnography as a methodology to move global studies from mere description or critique to grounded holistic analyses that unravel the complex human mechanisms underlying processes of glocalization. The study’s focus on the human aspects of globalization, on cosmopolitanism, and on the role of the imagi-nary in giving people’s lives meaning, illustrates some creative ways in which anthropolo-gies of tourism and travel can contribute to ongoing theoretical and methodological debates about the local-to-global nexus.
