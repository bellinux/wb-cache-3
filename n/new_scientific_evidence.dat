40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study on}} the {{identification}} of Cordyceps and establish its traditional pharmacognostic identification and modern identification method based on DNA molecular marker technology. METHODS: The methods of macroscopic, microscopic examination and RAPD-SCAR were employed here to authenticate Cordyceps. RESULTS: Based on the macroscopic identification, the features of transverse section and powder of Cordyceps were described in detail. The digital photographs were presented here in repealing the main macroscopic and microscopic characteristic of Cordyceps. The specific RAPD fragment of Cordyceps was conversed into SCAR marker, and Cordyceps could be identified by the optimized PCR conditions.

All ministerial documents do not provide any reference of specificity of motor control system and its classification. Furthermore, there are not any innovative elements on didactics and teaching methods according to scientific paradigms. It appears a repetitively traditional corpus of documents that must be changed.

In one hand the complex system of ministerial education is described in documents continuously updated and the school's secondary lower school has been reformed.

RECIPE projects that without measures to decarbonize energy systems, unabated carbon emissions will raise atmospheric concentrations to between 730 parts per million (ppm) and 840 ppm CO 2, inducing a global mean temperature increase of 3 - 7 °C above pre-industrial levels. The warming would come with severe impacts on natural and social systems. In addition, several tipping points, i. e. critical thresholds at which small perturbations can induce a qualitative shift in the mode of operation of the climate system, would likely be crossed, inflicting unprecedented damages on human settlements and ecosystems.

40|$|The {{literature}} suggests that the serum testosterone level required for maximum androgen receptor (AR) binding {{may be in the}} range of nanomolar and above this range of concentrations; this sexual hormone may not significantly affect tumour biology. This assumption is supported by clinical studies showing that cell proliferation markers did not change when serum T levels increased after exogenous T treatment in comparison to subjects treated with placebo. However, a considerable part of the global scientific community remains sceptical regarding the use of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in men suffering from hypogonadism and prostate cancer (Pca). The negative attitudes with respect to testosterone supplementation in men with hypogonadism and Pca may be justified by the relatively low number of clinical and preclinical studies that specifically dealt with how androgens affect Pca biology. More controversial still is the use of TRT in men in active surveillance or at intermediate or high risk of recurrence and treated by curative radiotherapy. In these clinical scenarios, clinicians should be aware that safety data regarding TRT are scanty limiting our ability to draw definitive conclusions on this important topic. In this review we critically discuss the <b>newest</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>evidence</b> concerning the <b>new</b> challenges in the treatment of men with hypogonadal condition and Pca providing new insights in the pharmacological and psychological approaches...|$|R
