25|$|The BC Express was {{launched}} on the 24th of June and Captain Bucey took {{her up to}} Fort George on the 29th. He was so impressed by how well she handled in the Cottonwood and Fort George canyons that he took her up to the Grand Canyon the following week, where she had <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> steaming over its infamous and deadly whirlpool. She continued to make trips between the Grand Canyon and Fort George until that September when the water levels dropped so low that Bucey decided that the Giscome Rapids were too unsafe to navigate. In October the water levels rose again and she made several trips between Fort George and Soda Creek before the season ended.|$|E

[...] "I never done nothink yit, but wot you knows on, {{to get myself}} into <b>no</b> <b>trouble.</b> I never was in <b>no</b> other <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> sir, 'sept not knowin' nothink and starwation." ...|$|R
50|$|Kim persuades him to stay, wanting them {{to become}} {{partners}} {{in more ways than}} one. Victor agrees, whereupon Kim learns that he and the Flamingo are actually having <b>no</b> money <b>troubles</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> their new partnership being what he'd had in mind all along.|$|R
60|$|In the Middle Ages, for example, {{this girl}} {{would have been}} a Damsel; and in that happy time {{practically}} everybody whose technical rating was that of Damsel was in distress and only too willing to waive the formalities in return for services rendered by the casual passer-by. But the twentieth century is a prosaic age, when girls are merely girls and have <b>no</b> <b>troubles</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Were he to stop this girl in brown and assure her that his aid and comfort were at her disposal, she would undoubtedly call that large policeman from across the way, and the romance would begin and end within the space of thirty seconds, or, if the policeman were a quick mover, rather less.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{children}} are such dears, Mr. Tryst. Billy seems to grow every day. They're <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> and quite happy. Biddy's wonderful with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This must be Flutterbudget Center," [...] {{declared}} the Wizard. [...] "You see, it's <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> to find places {{if you keep}} to the right road." ...|$|E

500|$|On 17 July 1951, it was {{announced}} that Becher had been appointed as an honorary aide-de-camp to the Governor-General of Australia for a period of three years. Following Warramungas departure from Korean waters on 1 August, Rear Admiral Alan Scott-Moncrieff, Commander West Coast Blockade Force, commented: [...] "She has been a tower of strength and done an incredible amount of steaming with <b>no</b> <b>troubles</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> I cannot speak too highly of Captain O. H. Becher and his men..." [...] Together with Bataan, Warramunga had borne the brunt of Australia's naval contribution to the Korean War. Noting his [...] "courage, skill and determination", a recommendation for Becher to be awarded the Distinguished Service Order was approved by the Australian Government on 17 August 1951, and announced in the London Gazette the following month. For his [...] "meritorious service... as C.O. of HMAS Warramunga", Becher was also decorated by the United States with the Legion of Merit.|$|R
60|$|He {{began by}} apologizing for the trouble {{he was giving}} her. She begged him not to mention it, assured him that walking downstairs was <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> to her <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> and then took a seat and waited patiently for him to begin his attack.|$|R
5000|$|... "Well, we ain’t got any," [...] George exploded. [...] "Whatever we ain’t got, that’s {{what you}} want. God a’mighty, if I was alone I could live so easy. I could {{go get a}} job an’ work, an’ <b>no</b> <b>trouble.</b> <b>No</b> mess <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> and when {{the end of the}} month come I could take my fifty bucks and go into town and get {{whatever}} I want. Why, I could stay in a cathouse all night. I could eat any place I want, hotel or any place, and order any damn thing I could think of. An’ I could do all that every damn month. Get a gallon of whisky, or set in a pool room and play cards or shoot pool." [...] Lennie knelt and looked over the fire at the angry George. And Lennie’s face was drawn in with terror. [...] "An’ whatta I got," [...] George went on furiously. [...] "I got you! You can’t keep a job and you lose me ever’ job I get. Jus’ keep me shovin’ all over the country all the time."

6000|$|... "We {{are delighted}} to see you here," [...] said Miss Thorne; [...] "you give us <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> {{and we think it}} a great favour conferred by you to come and see us--don't we, Wilfred?" ...|$|E
6000|$|CORNELIUS [anxious to {{cut short}} the discussion, {{which makes him}} ashamed of his house; for he guesses Broadbent's {{standard}} of comfort a little more accurately than his sister does] That's all right: it'll be <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Hweres Nora? ...|$|E
60|$|That {{was how the}} Fairy, the Pixie, the Knook and the Ryl all rode in the sledge {{with their}} master the {{following}} Christmas Eve; and they had <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in entering the new-fashioned houses and leaving toys for the children that lived in them.|$|E
6000|$|... "'You {{have been}} so long {{away from home and}} so long among the people that we have always {{regarded}} as aliens that I'm not sure that Jake will know you when he sees you. But Jake has a keen perception, and I rather believe that he will know a Virginia Carteret at sight. I can't conceive that even ten years in Yankee-land could change a boy of mine. Anyhow, I'm sure you will know Jake. I put eighteen collars in his valise. If he should have to buy others, he wears a number 15½. Please see that he gets the right ones. He will be <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> to you <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} it a great advantage," [...] {{one of them said}} to him. [...] "Of course, times may arrive when you will have to leave it behind; but, as a rule, there is <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> about it <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> You hire a native driver, who costs {{practically}} nothing, and he keeps with the baggage. No one asks any questions, and when you halt for a day or two, you have comforts. Of course, with a British regiment you are cut down to the last ounce, but with us it is altogether different. There being only three or four white officers to each regiment, the few extra camels in the train make no appreciable difference. Besides, these black fellows consider it quite natural and proper that their white officers should fare in a very different way from themselves; whereas a British Tommy would be inclined to grumble if he saw his officers enjoying luxuries, while he himself had to rough it." ...|$|R
50|$|Asimov {{began work}} on the book on 2 October, and found that he had <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> with it <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> writing {{anywhere}} from 6000 to 10,000 words a day without any sense of strain. By 27 January 1958, Asimov was able to deliver {{the first half of}} the completed manuscript to Basic Books, but at a meeting a month later, Svirsky suggested cutting the book in half so it could fit in one volume. At that point, Asimov was only two chapters shy of finishing the book, but saw no reason to complete it if it would be subjected to such radical abridgement, and halted work. He resumed work after being informed on 11 March That Svirsky would not try to reduce the book by half, but would instead publish it in two volumes. Svirsky also insisted that the book include an introduction by the geneticist George Wells Beadle. Asimov felt that his work didn't need an introduction by anyone else, and even though he found Beadle's introduction to be very elegant, he still resented its inclusion. Asimov delivered the final chapters to Basic Books on 21 April, and the appendices on 4 May.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Now, gentlemen, {{standing}} up here before you, I feel {{a good deal}} like Pat, and maybe after I've spieled along for a while, I may feel so darn small that I'll be able to crawl into a Pullman hammock with <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> at all! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{said the}} child, [...] "you are {{making fun of}} me, Cousin Eustace! I know there is not trouble enough {{in the world to}} fill such a great box as that. As for the snow-storm, it is <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> but a pleasure; so it could not have been in the box." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I like {{it better}} than Yarmouth; but perhaps that is because {{we live in a}} more airy and cheerful street. I would not have troubled you so early, Mr Moy"--("'Tain't <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> Nora; werry much the reverse")--"but that I am anxious to hear how you got on with poor Billy--" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Un homme qui dort ne donne pas de peine (A {{sleeping}} man is <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> all)," [...] Zaccaria urges.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, of course,' he {{answered}} readily. 'And as it's no bigger, I can carry {{it in my}} hand to the inn, and {{so it will be}} <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> all,--if I {{could be}} of any use. I don't know whether it is proper, but may I ask whether you call as,--as,--as a friend of Mr. Crawley's?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{continued}} the old lady, [...] "I {{am going to}} put the case into your hands. The man is, evidently, a good-for-nothing scoundrel, and has probably spent the little money that her miserable father left her. It's a clear case of desertion, and there should be <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in getting the divorce." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They mean nothing. Why, Miss Mackenzie, I {{should think}} it <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> {{to run down}} and consult you about {{anything}} that occurred, about any matter of business that weighed at all heavily, if nothing prevented me except distance. Thirty shillings more than does it all, with a return ticket, including a bit of lunch at the station." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{said she}} to Reddy, [...] "we {{must not only}} plan how to get that fat hen, but we must also plan how {{to get away with}} it safely. If only there was some way of getting in that {{henhouse}} at night, there would be <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> I don't suppose there is the least chance of that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O no!' {{she said}} brightly; 'I don't mind doing {{such a thing}} as that. Why not come with me tomorrow? I will say I am going to bring you. There will be <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> all.' ...|$|R
60|$|This {{demonstration}} {{was deemed}} very satisfactory, and the uneasiness among the residents abated considerably, while the Major and his officers felt convinced that, whatever happened at other stations, there would <b>at</b> least be <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> Deennugghur.|$|R
6000|$|He got up, {{and went}} {{away into the}} closet {{adjoining}} her room, in which a bed had been spread on the floor. There she heard him say: [...] "If we children was gone there'd be <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> all!" ...|$|R
60|$|He murmured complacently {{that there}} were but few things done in the town {{that he could not}} see the inside of. And as to this house, he had been using it off and on for nearly ten years. Nothing that went on in it could escape his great experience. It had been no trouble to him. <b>No</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> to return. The wind caught {{their wings}} and blew against them strongly, {{so that they}} had but to sail before the breeze and speed along until they were deep in the forest again. Then the wind moderated, and {{presently}} died away altogether, so that {{they were forced to}} begin flying in order to continue their journey home.|$|E
60|$|An {{important}} fact {{in domestic}} economy was discovered {{about this time}} by Euphemia and myself. Perhaps we were {{not the first to}} discover it, but we certainly did find it out,--and this fact was, that housekeeping costs money. At the end of every week we counted up our expenditures--it was <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> to count up our receipts--and every week the result was more unsatisfactory.|$|E
60|$|But we had <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> the settlement. Beyond {{refusing to}} sell us food, they left us to ourselves. The women and {{children}} stayed in the houses, and {{though some of the}} men appeared in sight they did not, as on former occasions, enter our camp and taunt us.|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "soothing system," [...] with {{important}} modifications, has been resumed at the chateau; yet I cannot help agreeing with Monsieur Maillard, {{that his own}} [...] "treatment" [...] was a very capital one of its kind. As he justly observed, it was [...] "simple--neat--and gave <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> all--not the least." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Mr. Andrew," [...] she said, [...] "I do {{not want}} to go back to the Hall. I am afraid of them all, and I am afraid of my {{stepmother}} more than any of them. Why may I not stay here? I will be very good, and I will give you <b>no</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>at</b> all." ...|$|R
