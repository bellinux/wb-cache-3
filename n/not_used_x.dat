50|$|The {{client-server}} model provides several advantages over all-inclusive music players. Clients may {{communicate with the}} server remotely over an intranet or over the Internet. The server can be a headless computer located anywhere on the network. Music playback can continue seamlessly when <b>not</b> <b>using</b> <b>X</b> or restarting X. Different clients {{can be used for}} different purposes - a lightweight client left open all the time for controlling playback with a more fully featured client used for intensive database searches. Several clients can use the same database, even running simultaneously - side-by-side, remotely or under different user accounts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A multi-temporal burn scar {{detection}} algorithm {{designed for}} global application is described and demonstrated using 24 -daily AVHRR images {{of an area}} of savanna burning near the Okavango Delta, Southern Africa. The algorithm is computationally simple, does <b>not</b> <b>use</b> ® <b>xed</b> thresholds except to detect saturated AVHRR pixels, and incorporates a recent active- ® re detection algorithm. The algorithm provides the basis for operational burn scar monitoring using the AVHRR and MODIS. 1...|$|R

However, because Front Row does <b>not</b> <b>use</b> QuickTime <b>X,</b> it lacks support for certain codec features like Sample Aspect Ratio.|$|R

50|$|BeOS was {{developed}} on custom AT&T Hobbit-based computers before switching to PowerPC hardware {{by a team}} led by former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée as an alternative to Mac OS.

Much effort was spent by the developers to make it an efficient platform for multimedia applications. Be Inc. was acquired by PalmSource, Inc. (Palm Inc. at the time) in 2001. The BeOS GUI still lives in Haiku, an open source software reimplementation of the BeOS.|$|R

2500|$|By the 1960s the Grace Memorial Bridge {{had become}} insufficient, with its two narrow 10-foot (3 m) lanes built for Ford Model As and its steep grades {{of up to}} 6 percent. Later changes to the side rail and curb reduced the lane width further. A new bridge was {{constructed}} alongside and parallel to it. Named for the then-South Carolina Highway Commissioner, the Silas N. Pearman Bridge opened in 1966 at cost of $15 million. Its three lanes, at a modern 12-foot (3.7 m) width, opened to northbound traffic while its older counterpart carried the southbound traffic into downtown Charleston. One lane was reversible on the Pearman bridge, which led to signs warning [...] "Use lanes with green arrow" [...] and [...] "Do <b>not</b> <b>use</b> red <b>X</b> lane" [...] on the bridge.|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to examine}} how {{students}} feel that the psychosocial work environment affects their mental health, {{and to find out}} if students feel they have the opportunity to influence their psychosocial work environment. To achieve this, we conducted a questionnaire survey. To ensure that the answers are <b>not</b> random, we <b>used</b> <b>X</b> 2 - test. Our study showed that the students feel that there is staff at the school who talk about how they should behave to one another so everyone feels good and that there are adults they can talk to if they are not feeling well. A good psychosocial work environment for students is a quiet, relaxed environment where it is quiet, but not too quiet, where it's easy to concentrate. The most prominent in the survey is the high noise level, students describe it is just too "buzzy". Validerat; 20130215 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

The adhesive quickly seeped inside and permanently attached the hood to Heinrich's flesh, preventing Zemo from ever removing his hood. Believing that he had killed his rival at long last, Zemo fled to South America as Hitler and the Nazis fell and World War II ended. After the mask was permanently bonded to his face, Zemo abandoned his long-suffering wife and toddler son, toward whom he had become emotionally and physically abusive. With an army of mercenaries loyal to him, Zemo enslaved a tribe of natives and lived as a king as he tried desperately to find a solvent that would remove his mask. After decades passed, Captain America was revived by the Avengers. This causes Zemo to renew his rivalry with the Captain. Among his attempts included sending agents {{to take the place of}} participants of a hand-to-hand combat demonstration with Captain America in order to capture him. As Captain America learned that Zemo was behind this attack, he sent a taunting message on Zemo's minions' communicator to provoke the villain into becoming more carelessly aggressive against him and thus provide an opportunity for the superhero to deal with the villain directly.|$|R
