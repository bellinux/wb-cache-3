5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping <b>noise</b> (<b>like</b> the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
5|$|Music, {{dance and}} singing {{are part of}} many a Kanak {{ceremonial}} function such as initiation, courting and mourning. Conch shells are blown by an appointed person to represent a clan chief’s arrival or the voice of an ancestor. Rhythm instruments used include Bwanjep, used during ceremonies {{by a group of}} men; Jew's harp, (wadohnu in the Nengone language where it originated) made of dried piece of coconut palm leaf held between the teeth and an attached segment of soft nerve leaf; coconut-leaf whizzer, a piece of coconut leaf attached to a string and twirled that produces a <b>noise</b> <b>like</b> a humming bee; oboe, made of hollow grass stems or bamboo; end-blown flute, made of 50cm long hollowed pawpaw leaf stem; bamboo stamping tubes that are struck vertically against the ground and played at major events; percussion instruments (hitting sticks, palm sheaths); rattles that are worn on the legs made of coconut leaves, shells and certain fruits. Kanak groups such as Bethela first made the recordings on cassette around 1975 or 1976.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a <b>noise</b> <b>like</b> thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E

25|$|On January 27, 2009, {{one of the}} coaster cars did {{not make}} it over the last hill on the Fairly Odd Coaster and stalled. No one was hurt, and once the lap bars were unlatched, the riders in the stalled car were let off. The other two cars on the circuit were stopped safely by the computer's {{actuation}} of the ride's air brakes. The ride's air brakes made a <b>noise</b> <b>like</b> a gunshot, which caused a small panic. The ride was running normally the next day.|$|E
25|$|Whalers and sealers {{had been}} visiting the South Australian coast since 1802 and by 1819 {{there was a}} {{permanent}} camp on Karta, Kangaroo Island. Many of these men were escaped convicts, sealers, whalers who had brought Tasmanian Aboriginal women with them but they also raided the mainland for women, particularly Ramindjeri. Originally the most heavily populated area in Australia, a smallpox epidemic had travelled down the River Murray before colonisation, possibly killing {{a majority of the}} Ngarrindjeri. Funeral rites and cultural practices were disrupted, family groups merged and land use became altered. Songs from the time tell of the smallpox {{that came out of the}} Southern Cross in the east with a loud <b>noise</b> <b>like</b> a bright flash. In 1830 the first exploratory expedition reached the Ngarrindjeri lands and Charles Sturt noted that the people were already familiar with firearms.|$|E

Matt Peckham described the plot as [...] "fantastic and original", and praised the game's replayability.

500|$|The term tengu and the {{characters}} used to write it are borrowed from {{the name of a}} fierce demon from Chinese folklore called tiāngoǔ. Chinese literature assigns this creature a variety of descriptions, but most often it is a fierce and [...] canine monster that resembles a shooting star or comet. It makes a <b>noise</b> <b>like</b> thunder and brings war wherever it falls. One account from the Shù Yì Jì ( [...] , [...] "A Collection of Bizarre Stories"), written in 1791, describes a dog-like tiāngoǔ with a sharp beak and an upright posture, but usually tiāngoǔ bear little resemblance to their Japanese counterparts.|$|E
500|$|For Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust, {{the song}} [...] "starts out {{dangerously close to}} 'Drops of Jupiter' territory, but luckily, there are no fried chicken or soy latte lyrics to be found here." [...] He also noted that, [...] "'When I Was Your Man' goes minimal with the musical accompaniment, {{featuring}} just Bruno and his piano, sounding halfway between an Alicia Keys ballad and Prince’s 'How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore?'." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent called it a [...] "McCartney-esque piano ballad." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix thought that the song [...] "sounds {{like a cross between}} Stevie Wonder and Elton John," [...] also seeing [...] "a touch of Michael Jackson" [...] in his delivery. Sam Lansky of Idolator agreed, writing that [...] "while evoking Elton John, the track sounds like it was recorded live in a piano bar, with audible background <b>noise,</b> <b>like</b> the spooling of film on a projector." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said that Mars lists everything he should have done for the one he loved before she broke up with him.|$|E

2500|$|The chief {{example of}} {{architecture}} is the Chavín de Huantar temple. The temple's design shows complex innovation {{to adapt to}} the highland environments of Peru. [...] To avoid the temple's being flooded and destroyed during the rainy season, the Chavín people created a successful drainage system. [...] Several canals built under the temple acted as drainage. [...] The Chavín people also showed advanced acoustic understanding. [...] During the rainy season water rushes through the canals and creates a roaring sound and creates a <b>noise</b> <b>like</b> a jaguar, a sacred animal. The temple was built of white granite and black limestone, neither of which is found near the Chavín site. This meant that leaders organized many workers to bring the special materials from far away rather than use local rock deposits.|$|E
2500|$|The first Spaniard to {{document}} the island was Juan Manuel de Ayala in 1775, who charted San Francisco Bay and {{named one of the}} three islands he identified as the [...] "La Isla de los Alcatraces," [...] which translates as [...] "The Island of the Pelicans," [...] from the archaic Spanish [...] ("pelican"). Over the years, the Spanish version [...] "Alcatraz" [...] became popular and is now widely used. In August 1827, French Captain Auguste Bernard Duhaut-Cilly wrote [...] "... running past Alcatraze's (Pelicans) Island ... covered with a countless number of these birds. A gun fired over the feathered legions caused them to fly up in a great cloud and with a <b>noise</b> <b>like</b> a hurricane." [...] The California brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis californicus) is not known to nest on the island today. The Spanish built several small buildings on the island and other minor structures.|$|E
2500|$|Two acquaintances of Markhasev, Sara Peters and Michael Chang, {{testified against}} {{him at the}} grand jury. Peters and her boyfriend, Eli Zakaria (who refused to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not {{incriminate}} himself), were with Markhasev {{on the night of}} the murder and were high on cocaine and heroin. She testified they had stopped to use the pay phone at a park-and-ride lot about [...] from where Cosby had pulled over to fix his flat tire. Peters testified that while Zakaria was on the phone, Markhasev walked off without saying where he was going. Within a few minutes, Peters heard a loud <b>noise</b> <b>like</b> a car backfiring, and Markhasev ran back to the car, saying, [...] "Let's go. We've got to get out of here. Let's go." [...] Markhasev refused to tell them what had happened, but they stopped at a wooded area that matched the description of where the murder weapon was later discovered.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{episode was}} not broadcast until 26 August 1991, when the BBC aired a version that edited together {{the first half}} of the taping with one of the two completed second halves. As it happened, the version chosen was the one in which the TARDIS doors would not close; other errors included actress Carole Ann Ford fluffing a line of dialogue, Jacqueline Hill getting caught in a doorway, a camera banging into a piece of scenery during one of the scrapyard sequences, and William Russell accidentally knocking over a mannequin in the scrapyard. Earlier, in June 1991, a version with the first half edited together with the other take of the second half of the pilot was released on the VHS compilation The Hartnell Years; later, in 2000, the complete version (including both takes) was released in a remastered form on VHS, along with The Edge of Destruction. In 2006, the Doctor Who: The Beginning DVD set contained two versions of the episode: an unedited studio recording including all takes of the second part of the show, and a newly created version of the pilot that uses the best footage from the original recording, with additional editing and digital adjustments to remove blown lines, technical problems, and reduce studio <b>noise.</b> <b>Like</b> the other episodes from this serial, both versions of the [...] "pilot" [...] were remastered for DVD release, using VidFIRE technology that simulated the original video look of the 1963 production.|$|E
2500|$|Pupa. Suspended by {{the tail}} and a band that encircles it much nearer the head than is usual with Papilio pupae. In form stout, flattened, dilated in the middle, with head and thorax thrown back. Head {{somewhat}} angular and tuberculated; two of the abdominal segments each with a prominent dorsal pair of pointed tubercles. Colour usually light brown, with a strongly contrasting saddle of old gold. (After Davidson & Aitken) - Mr T. A. Sealy (Proc. Ent Soc. 1875 p.9) states- [...] "The pupa possesses the power of making a curious <b>noise</b> <b>like</b> pha-pha!, and makes it very loudly when touched; the noise is accompanied (perhaps produced) by a short contraction of the abdominal segments. I thought {{at first it was}} merely produced by the rubbing of one ring of the pupa-case against the next, but the sound did not resemble a mere frictional sound, it was more like the sound of a rush of air through small holes. I tried to produce it with a dead chrysalis but failed: the pupa sometimes contracted on being touched without making the noise, and appeared unable to make the noise until some time was given to allow it to recover its vigour." [...] Messrs. Davidson and Aitken have also noticed this power in the pupa, but they speak of it [...] "as a husky squeaking noise, produced apparently by friction of the abdominal rings." ...|$|E

50|$|After {{he stepped}} down from the deanship, Sturges taught only three courses, {{annually}} in rotation, one semester each year—arbitration, real-property credit transactions, and chattel credit transactions. Using an advanced form of the Socratic method, he sought in these courses to teach students rhetoric and advocacy rather than substantive law—what he termed “learning to stand up on your hind legs and make <b>noises</b> <b>like</b> a lawyer.” He was famous at Yale for his technique of calling upon a student to recite what a case held, asking him whether he agreed or disagreed with the court’s ruling, and regardless of how the student replied, slowly forcing him by pointing out difficulties in that position, to adopt the contrary view, whereupon Sturges would by the same technique then argue the student back to conceding the validity of his original position. The point was to teach students both how to make <b>noises</b> <b>like</b> a lawyer and not to get led down the primrose path by an adversary.|$|R
2500|$|In June 1988, police closed an {{investigation}} into alleged jamming of the Cox campaign's phone lines by supporters of Rosenberg. [...] "For several weeks, about every third call we got {{was one of these}} bogus calls. You would hear a kind of whirring <b>noise</b> <b>like</b> a machine of some kind. ... It got so bad just before the election that we had to move our get-out-the vote operation to another office and use cellular phones in the field," [...] said Cox's campaign manager Bob Schuman. A representative of the police said that charges were not made because though the location of the jamming was traced, it could not be determined specifically which individuals were responsible. [...] "It's incredible to me that someone can do what was done to us and we have an absolute identification" [...] of the location of the jamming, said Schuman. [...] "I can't speak for Chris, but I feel pretty strongly that we don't want to let them get away with it. We don't want to let it end here," [...] he said. Rosenberg denied knowledge about the phone jamming. [...] "I don't know anything about it. I don't want to speculate about who might have done this to Cox's phones, but I certainly don't condone it," [...] said Rosenberg. Rosenberg posited that the Cox campaign was requested police look into the matter as a tactic to discourage him from attempting a write-in-campaign against Cox in the November general election for Congress. According to the Orange County Deputy District Attorney, the phone calls were traced to a residence owned by Rosenberg supporters. The residence belonged to a developer and his wife who had each made donations of $1,000 to Rosenberg's campaign for Congress.|$|E
