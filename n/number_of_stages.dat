5|$|Bills can be {{introduced}} to Parliament {{in a number of}} ways; the Scottish Government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill; a committee of the Parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit; a member of the Scottish Parliament can introduce a bill as a private member; or a private bill can be submitted to Parliament by an outside proposer. Most draft laws are government bills introduced by ministers in the governing party (or parties). Bills pass through Parliament in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> before receiving royal assent, whereupon they become Acts of the Scottish Parliament.|$|E
5|$|On release, {{the four}} reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded Kirby's Block Ball for modifying the Breakout formula {{to create a}} new and enjoyable game. They {{especially}} praised the unique power-ups, though Crispin Boyer and Sushi X also felt the game was too short and easy. Nintendo Power said they enjoyed Block Ball and its <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages,</b> but wondered how its eight megabits of memory were being used. The magazine found the parts where Kirby eats the unbreakable blocks to be innovative. All six of the magazine's reviewers recommended the game.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the yearly}} {{changes in the}} route, race length, and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages,</b> the biggest change to the how the general {{classification}} was to be calculated. The organizers chose to make the general classification centered around teams rather than individuals like the race was contested {{in the first three}} years of its existence. They chose to only allow teams of four riders to compete in the race, making this the first Giro d'Italia to not contain any independent riders. Each team was required to have three riders finish each stage in order to remain in the race. The general classification was still determined by a point system: four points went to the team that the stage winner came from, if a team got two riders in the top four placings on a stage they got two points, and if a team completed the stage with the minimum three riders, they earned one point.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, Auckland Transport {{simplified}} fares {{by changing}} {{to a system}} based on 13 fare zones. The fare is no longer based on the distance travelled (<b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages),</b> but {{on the number of}} zones passed through, so that a journey in a zone that involves multiple rides or even a mode mix (bus, train, ferry) will be charged only one fare.|$|E
25|$|The {{acceleration}} {{occurs in}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages.</b> The first stage is the 750 keV Cockcroft-Walton pre-accelerator, which ionizes hydrogen gas and accelerates the negative ions created using a positive voltage. The ions then pass into the 150 meter long linear accelerator (linac) which uses oscillating electrical fields to accelerate the ions to 400 MeV. The ions then pass through a carbon foil, to remove the electrons, and the charged protons then move into the Booster.|$|E
25|$|The Bradford Mela is {{now part}} of the bigger Bradford Festival which takes place in June. The word mela is Sanskrit for 'a gathering' or 'to meet'. In the UK, melas provide an {{opportunity}} for communities to come together to celebrate and share their cultures. Mela festivals include a combination of markets, funfairs, food and drink, arts and workshops, children's activities, strolling entertainment and a variety of music and dance performances on a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages.</b> Bradford held the first mela in Europe in September 1988 and it is presently held in Bradford City Park.|$|E

25|$|The airfoil {{profiles}} are optimized and matched {{for specific}} velocities and turning. Although compressors can be run at other conditions with different flows, speeds, or pressure ratios, this {{can result in}} an efficiency penalty or even a partial or complete breakdown in flow (known as compressor stall and pressure surge respectively). Thus, a practical limit on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages,</b> and the overall pressure ratio, comes from {{the interaction of the}} different stages when required to work away from the design conditions. These “off-design” conditions can be mitigated to a certain extent by providing some flexibility in the compressor. This is achieved normally through the use of adjustable stators or with valves that can bleed fluid from the main flow between stages (inter-stage bleed).|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{considered}} usually {{consists of a}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then {{impact on the environment}} can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive life phase of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight, and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or manufacturing cost.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountains}} classification and {{the individual}} time trial were both introduced in the 1933 Giro d'Italia. The mountains classification awarded points to the riders who crossed certain mountains on the race route first and the rider with the most points was the leader. In addition, the organizers also expanded the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> to seventeen, it had been around twelve the few preceding years. Alfredo Binda gained the lead after the second stage, but lost it to Jef Demuysere after the fifth stage. After the eighth stage, Binda regained the lead and had a six-minute advantage over Demuysere. Binda won the next three stages {{and went on to}} win the race as a whole. Along with winning the general classification, Binda won the inaugural mountains classification. By winning this edition of the Giro, Binda became the first five-time winner of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of the inner German border {{took place in a}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> between 1945 and the mid-1980s. After its establishment in 1945 as the dividing line between the Western and Soviet occupation zones of Germany, in 1949 the inner German border became the frontier between the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany). The border remained relatively easy to cross until it was abruptly closed by the GDR in 1952 in response to the large-scale emigration of East Germans to the West. Barbed-wire fences and minefields were installed and draconian restrictions were placed on East German citizens living near the border. Thousands were expelled from their homes, with several thousand more fleeing to the West. From the late 1960s, the border fortifications were greatly strengthened through the installation of new fences, detectors, watchtowers and booby-traps designed to prevent attempts to escape from East Germany. The improved border defences succeeded in reducing the scale of unauthorised emigration to a trickle.|$|E
25|$|Continuous {{distillation}} {{differs from}} batch distillation in the respect that concentrations should not change over time. Continuous distillation can be run {{at a steady}} state for an arbitrary amount of time. For any source material of specific composition, the main variables that affect the purity of products in continuous distillation are the reflux ratio {{and the number of}} theoretical equilibrium stages, in practice determined by the number of trays or the height of packing. Reflux is a flow from the condenser back to the column, which generates a recycle that allows a better separation with a given number of trays. Equilibrium stages are ideal steps where compositions achieve vapor–liquid equilibrium, repeating the separation process and allowing better separation given a reflux ratio. A column with a high reflux ratio may have fewer stages, but it refluxes a large amount of liquid, giving a wide column with a large holdup. Conversely, a column with a low reflux ratio must have a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages,</b> thus requiring a taller column.|$|E
25|$|After it was {{established}} that infants could babble {{with their hands}} and their mouths, the patterns in which productions occurred were studied. Speaking and signing infants follow very similar maturational paths in language acquisition. Both go through a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages,</b> and exhibit similar complexity in their babbling sequences. In studies where deaf and hearing children were compared, children learning sign language produced more multi-movement manual babbling than children who were not learning a sign language. There are three main components of manual babbling. The hand gestures contain a restricted set of phonetic units, show a syllabic organization, and are used without reference or meaning. This is comparable to aspects of vocal babbling as mentioned above. It is difficult to study manual babbling as often the manual activity can be mistaken as gestures rather than signs. When signing children are in fact babbling it will most often take place {{in front of their}} torso in a designated area that is called the phonetic space. One of the most common forms of manual babbling is the extension and spreading of all fingers. This babble {{is also one of the}} first indicators that an infant will begin to make in manual communication.|$|E

500|$|The Cleveland Railway {{was built}} as a freight railway and {{provided}} no passenger services during its brief existence as an independently owned railway. It was built in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages,</b> bypassing the centre of Guisborough, and opened in November 1861. Its construction was repeatedly held up by disputes with its main rival, the Stockton and Darlington Railway, which attempted unsuccessfully to use all means at its disposal to maintain its rail monopoly south of the Tees. However, the Cleveland Railway remained independent only until 1865, when {{the company and its}} rivals were bought out by the North Eastern Railway (NER).|$|E
