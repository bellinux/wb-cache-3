5|$|France's {{defeat in}} Indochina, {{coupled with the}} German {{destruction}} of her armies just 14 years earlier, seriously damaged its prestige elsewhere in its colonial empire, {{as well as with}} its <b>NATO</b> <b>allies,</b> most importantly, the United States. Within its empire, the defeat in Indochina served to spur independence movements in other colonies, notably the North African territories from which many of the troops who fought at Điện Biên Phủ had been recruited.|$|E
5|$|In late 2014, the USAF {{was testing}} a rapid {{deployment}} concept involving four F-22s and one C-17 for support, first proposed in 2008 by two F-22 pilots. The goal {{was for the}} type {{to be able to}} set up and engage in combat within 24 hours. Four F-22s were deployed to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany in August and Lask Air Base in Poland and Amari Air Base in Estonia in September 2015 to train with <b>NATO</b> <b>allies.</b>|$|E

5|$|After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed {{for power}} during {{what became known}} as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between {{capitalism}} and communism and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its <b>NATO</b> <b>allies</b> on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{escalation}} of the Cold War was highlighted by Truman's approval of NSC-68, a secret statement of foreign policy. It called for tripling the defense budget, and the globalization and militarization of containment policy whereby the U.S. and its <b>NATO</b> <b>allies</b> would respond militarily to actual Soviet expansion. The document was drafted by Paul Nitze, who consulted State and Defense officials; it was formally approved by President Truman as official national strategy after the war began in Korea. It called for partial mobilization of the U.S. economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets. The plan called for strengthening Europe, weakening the Soviet Union, and for building up the U.S. both militarily and economically.|$|E

Nevertheless, the consent of the British Prime Minister is and has been always required for the use of British nuclear weapons, including SLBMs.|$|E

Besides being used by the air force and <b>NATO</b> <b>allies,</b> the KDC-10s are also used to support peacekeeping and humanitarian aid operations. Of the first three years, 32% of the flight hours were used for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid.|$|E
25|$|The {{acquisition}} of the A-7P Corsair II {{was the result of}} many attempts by Portugal to replace its F-86F Sabre in the air defense role and, to some extent, the Fiat G.91 in the ground attack role. The first attempts started in 1968, during the Ultramar War, due to the performance of the Portuguese fighters in Africa. After the end of the war, the Portuguese Air Force (PoAF) renewed its attempts in procuring new air combat aircraft because of the F-86 and G.91 being outdated compared to the aircraft fielded by its <b>NATO</b> <b>allies</b> and the countries of the Warsaw Pact.|$|E
25|$|According to University of Amsterdam {{professor}} 'C. Wiebes', the Hellenic National Intelligence Service (EYP) systematically sabotaged NATO {{operations in}} Bosnia in the mid-1990s, {{in an attempt}} to aid Bosnian Serb nationalists. In his report for the Dutch government, entitled Intelligence en de oorlog in Bosnie 1992-1995, Wiebes claims that EYP leaked classified NATO military plans (to which, as an allied intelligence service, it had access) to the Serb Bosnian leadership, and often to General Ratko Mladić himself, during the summer of 1995. Eventually, Wiebes states in the report, <b>NATO</b> <b>allies</b> ceased sharing NATO military plans with the Greek authorities.|$|E

25|$|She {{supported}} the US bombing raid on Libya from {{bases in the}} UK in 1986 when other <b>NATO</b> <b>allies</b> would not. Her liking for defence ties with the United States was demonstrated in the Westland affair when she acted with colleagues to prevent the helicopter manufacturer Westland, a vital defence contractor, from linking with the Italian firm Agusta in favour of a link with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation of the United States. Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who had pushed the Agusta deal, resigned in protest at her style of leadership, and thereafter became a potential leadership challenger.|$|E
25|$|Germany's capital, Berlin, {{was deep}} within the area {{controlled}} after World War II by the Soviet Union. Initially governed in four sectors controlled by the four Allied powers (United States, United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union), tensions of the Cold War escalated until the Soviet forces implemented the Berlin Blockade, which the Western allies relieved with the dramatic airlift. Afterward, the sectors controlled by the <b>NATO</b> <b>Allies</b> became an effective exclave of West Germany, completely surrounded by East Germany. From 1952, the border between East and West was closed everywhere but in Berlin. Hundreds of thousands of East Germans defected to the West via West Berlin, a labour drain that threatened East Germany with economic collapse.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy of}} the United States was colored by {{considerable}} uncertainty as to whom to befriend in the Near East. American policy was torn between a desire to maintain good relations with <b>NATO</b> <b>allies</b> such as Britain and France who were also major colonial powers, {{and a desire to}} align Third World nationalists with the Free World camp. Though it would be entirely false to describe the coup deposing King Farouk in July 1952 as a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) coup, Nasser and his Society of Free Officers were nonetheless in close contact with CIA operatives led by Miles Copeland beforehand (Nasser maintained links with any and all potential allies from the Egyptian Communist Party on the left to the Muslim Brotherhood on the right).|$|E

25|$|Starting {{in early}} 2012 several insurgent groups in Mali {{started to take}} over the country. In January 2013 Mali asked for {{assistance}} from France to aid in ridding the country of the rebel insurgents. In December, the UN authorized an African intervention with the approval of the Economic Community of West African States. France then proceeded to ask its <b>NATO</b> <b>allies</b> to get involved, with Canada joining the effort by helping with the transportation of troops with a C-17 Globemaster. This was followed by twenty four Joint Task Force 2 members who entered the country to secure the Canadian embassy in the capital Bamako. A ceasefire agreement was signed on February 19, 2015 in Algiers, Algeria but sporadic terrorist attacks still occur.|$|E
25|$|Clashes between East Pakistan and West Pakistan soon erupted, further destabilising {{the entire}} country. The two states had {{different}} political ideologies and different lingual cultural aspect. West Pakistan had been {{founded on the}} main basis of a parliamentary democracy (and had a parliamentary republic form of government since 1947), with Islam as its state religion. In contrast, East Pakistan had been a socialist state since the 1954 elections, with state secularism proclaimed. West Pakistan sided with the United States and her <b>NATO</b> <b>allies,</b> whilst East Pakistan remained sympathetic to the Soviet Union and her Eastern Bloc. Pakistan's 1956 constitution validated the parliamentary form of government, with Islam as state religion and Urdu, English and Bengali as state languages. The 1956 constitution also established the Parliament of Pakistan {{as well as the}} Supreme Court of Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|NATO’s {{vehicles}} have {{a specific}} mandate to provide protection and deterrence of piracy in its territorial waters. All members of NATO help make the operation a success via funding or through ships. <b>NATO</b> <b>Allies</b> provide ships and maritime patrol aircraft to NATO Standing Maritime Groups, which in turn assigns a number of ships, on a rotational basis, to Ocean Shield. “In January 2013, there were no attacks, approaches or disruptions in the area. In comparison, in January 2012, there were four pirate attacks in which all were unsuccessful. Additionally, out of 80 suspected pirates captured by counter piracy forces, 59 were captured by NATO ships. In January 2011, there were 29 attacks and six ships were captured.” Arguably the operation has succeeded in decreasing piracy in the region while the task force was in power.|$|E
