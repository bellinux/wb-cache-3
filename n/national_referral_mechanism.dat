25|$|In the UK, human {{trafficking}} cases are processed {{by the same}} officials to simultaneously determine the refugee and trafficking victim statuses of a person. However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country. A person may need assistance as a trafficking victim but his/her circumstances may not necessarily meet the threshold for asylum. In which case, not being granted refugee status affects their status as a trafficked victim and thus their ability to receive help. Reviews of the statistics from the <b>National</b> <b>Referral</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (NRM), a tool created by the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE Convention) to help states effectively identify and care for trafficking victims, found that positive decisions for non-European Union citizens were much {{lower than that of}} EU and UK citizens. According to data on the NRM decisions from April 2009 to April 2011, an average of 82.8% of UK and EU citizens were conclusively accepted as victims while an average of only 45.9% of non-EU citizens were granted the same status. High refusal rates of non-EU people point to possible stereotypes and biases about regions and countries of origin which may hinder anti-trafficking efforts, since the asylum system is linked to the trafficking victim protection system.|$|E

50|$|In January 2010, the Armenian {{government}} enacted {{legislation that}} increased the minimum penalty for convicted trafficking offenders to five years’ imprisonment, {{allowed for the}} confiscation of assets from convicted trafficking offenders, and exempted trafficking victims from criminal prosecution for crimes committed {{as a direct result}} of being trafficked. While the government did not provide funding for victim assistance in 2009, in March 2010 it allocated approximately $15,000 to an NGO-run shelter for facility rent. The government continued to implement its <b>national</b> trafficking victim <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism</b> and nearly doubled the number of victims it identified compared with the previous year. The government demonstrated modest progress in combating government officials’ complicity in trafficking.|$|R
50|$|The Government of Jordan {{does not}} fully comply with the minimum {{standards}} {{for the elimination of}} trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During 2015, the government substantially increased efforts to prosecute and convict trafficking offenders, and continued to identify and refer to protection services an increased number of trafficking victims. Authorities also increased referrals of trafficking victims to a government-run shelter for gender-based violence (GBV) victims; as of early 2014, this shelter provided specific care for trafficking victims. Furthermore, in March 2015, the government completed construction of a shelter dedicated exclusively to trafficking victims, and {{was in the process of}} equipping and staffing the facility at the end of the reporting period; it was also in the process of drafting a <b>national</b> victim <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism</b> at the end of the reporting period. Though the government improved its law enforcement and victim identification and referral efforts, it did not systematically investigate potential cases of trafficking that involved withholding of passports and wages. Trafficking victims—particularly domestic workers who ran away from abusive employers—continued to face arrest and imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} investigated 15 {{cases of}} trafficking - including nine sex trafficking and six labor trafficking investigations - compared with 13 investigations in 2008. Armenian courts prosecuted 19 individuals in 12 trafficking cases during the reporting period, compared with eight individuals prosecuted in 2008. Authorities convicted 11 trafficking offenders in 2009 - including eight individuals for sex trafficking and three for labor trafficking - up from four convictions in 2008. All 11 convicted offenders in 2009 were given prison sentences; no traffickers received suspended sentences. Four offenders were given sentences ranging {{from three to}} five years’ and seven offenders were given sentences ranging from seven to 13 years’ imprisonment. As {{a result of the}} government’s anti-trafficking partnerships with outside parties, approximately 447 government officials received training from anti-trafficking NGOs, international organizations, foreign governments, and the Armenian government on a range of anti-trafficking issues including the application of Armenia’s anti-trafficking law and the <b>national</b> victim <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism,</b> investigation techniques, and forced labor. Although there were no new reports of government officials’ complicity in trafficking over the last year, the government demonstrated only modest progress in the reopened investigation of a well-documented 2006 corruption case. The separate trial of a former deputy principal of a state-run special needs school who was accused of forcing two students to beg in 2008 remained in progress at the conclusion of this reporting period.|$|R

50|$|NGOs {{expressed}} concern that the <b>national</b> <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism</b> was disproportionately focused on prosecuting trafficking offenders rather than assisting victims. The government significantly increased the number of identified victims during the reporting period: law enforcement officials identified 60 victims in 2009 and referred 22 of them to NGOs for assistance, compared with 34 victims identified and 20 referred for assistance in 2008. Foreign-funded NGOs assisted 26 victims in 2009, compared with 24 victims in 2008. Victims were encouraged to cooperate with law enforcement bodies; in 2009, all 60 victims assisted police with trafficking investigations.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{government}} drafted legislation {{to ensure that}} domestic trafficking victims receive free healthcare, a lack of implementation of this provision resulted in an NGO paying for some victims’ emergency medical care in 2009. During the reporting period, {{the government}} took over complete financial responsibility for the <b>National</b> <b>Referral</b> <b>Mechanism</b> Office, a coordinating body responsible for monitoring victim identification, referral, assistance, and legal processes. Macedonian law provides legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face retribution or hardship through both a two-month reflection period and a six-month residency permit. The government encouraged victims {{to participate in the}} prosecution of their traffickers; it reported that three victims provided witness testimony in courts and three assisted in law enforcement investigations in 2009. Reportedly, one of the reasons victims do not report their traffickers is because the traffickers tell the victims they have connections with the police.|$|E

50|$|The Government of Albania {{has taken}} some steps to improve its efforts to {{identify}} and protect victims of trafficking. The government has implemented a <b>National</b> <b>Referral</b> <b>Mechanism</b> and conducted meetings with relevant stakeholders to improve its functioning. It identified 94 victims of trafficking in 2009, compared with 108 in 2008. The government's one shelter assisted 24 victims and NGOs assisted 70 during 2009. In 2009, the government provided free professional training to 38 victims, provided 11 with micro-credit loans to start private businesses, and integrated five victims into schools. In January 2010, it approved a draft law to provide social assistance to trafficking victims bridging {{the time that they}} leave the shelters until they find employment. NGO-managed shelters continued to rely primarily on international donor funds in order to provide comprehensive services to trafficking victims. The government funds and operates a reception center that houses both victims of trafficking and irregular foreign migrants identified within Albanian territory; however, victims' freedom of movement is often restricted in this high-security center. The government does not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed in connection with their being trafficked and, under law, it offers legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution.|$|E

50|$|A {{system that}} is {{currently}} in place for helping trafficked people is the <b>National</b> <b>Referral</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (NRM). In order to protect trafficked people, a first responder must refer the woman to the NRM. A first responder might include the National Health Service or local authorities. In these cases, the victim has to consent to being referred, and it is preferred that it is done within 48 hours of contact with the victim. The referral {{is sent to the}} Competent Authority which is the program that will decide whether or not a person is being trafficked. The Competent Authority will analyze the referral form and make a decision within 5 business days. If the victim is believed to be trafficked, the Competent Authority will grant the victim a 45-day recovery and reflection period. This would involve being in a safe environment with medical and other kinds of help. Before the end of the 45-day period, the Competent Authority will make a ‘conclusive decision’ {{about whether or not the}} victim was one of trafficking. These results might depend on evidence that is recovered during the 45-day period. If you are found to be a victim of trafficking, a decision might be made to extend your recovery period, or to grant you a residence permit. If you receive a negative conclusive decision, the only option you have is to ask the Competent Authority to review the decision. If the authority still has not found you eligible, you have the option to challenge the decision by the judicial review. You should obtain a legal representative to go through this process, they will be able to discuss your rights according to the country you are from.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} child trafficking in the United Kingdom and of multi-agency responses in tackling it. The UK, as a signatory to the recent trafficking protocols, is required to implement measures to identify and support potential victims of trafficking - via the <b>National</b> <b>Referral</b> <b>Mechanism.</b> Effective support for child victims is reliant on cooperation between agencies. Our regional case-study contends that fragmented agency understandings of protocols and disjointed partnership approaches in service delivery means the trafficking of vulnerable children continues across the region.

40|$|Trafficking of {{children}} and young people has become an increasingly debated issue in the UK, with official statistics often considered to reflect only the “tip of the iceberg” of cases. Identification of a child as “trafficked” relies upon referral to designated “first responders” and “competent authorities” within a <b>National</b> <b>Referral</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (NRM). This article explores the complex undertaking of identifying a child as “trafficked”. It is suggested that, like any other form of child protection, in cases of “trafficking” there are unlikely to be “magic bullets” providing immediate answers to why children are not always seen as being exploited and/or abused and consequently identified as “trafficked”. Drawing on findings from two qualitative studies into understandings of trafficking amongst agencies working with children, it is suggested that identifying “trafficking” {{of children}} could be enhanced if a broader range of agencies had roles in the process, particularly those working within community engagement frameworks in positions to form crucial relationships of trust with children...|$|E

40|$|Following the UK Government’s {{ratification}} of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings in December 2008, a <b>National</b> <b>Referral</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (NRM) was implemented for adults and children trafficked into and within the UK. To accompany this mechanism the London Safeguarding Children Board developed an assessment framework and guidance to support practitioners and policy makers working with suspected victims of child trafficking. This framework and guidance was piloted as the London SCB London Safeguarding Trafficked Children Toolkit 2009 in 12 local authority areas across the UK and monitored by a national monitoring group consisting of representatives of various interested stakeholders. The monitoring included three short questionnaires for the 12 pilot local authorities and corresponding police forces, with additional statistics provided by UK Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC).   This monitoring report is being undertaken by the London Safeguarding Children Board to identify {{ways in which the}} assessment framework in the toolkit facilitated or hindered the identification, assessment and support of trafficked children in the 12 pilot local authority areas.

40|$|This {{research}} explores women’s {{experiences of}} Human Trafficking (HT) and their {{understandings of the}} term ‘support’ in light of these. It explores what type of support they saw as being useful to them given their experiences. This study was necessary and timely given {{the publication of the}} 2015 <b>National</b> <b>Referral</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (NRM), the UK policy to protect survivors of HT, which requires services to provide medical, legal and psychological ‘support’ to survivors. It has been argued that these services can be limited, particularly psychology, given that they are built on professional conceptualisations of what is necessary and useful and neglect a survivor’s perspective. The study involved in-depth interviews with sixteen survivors of HT who were all within the NRM. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis from a critical realist epistemology within a realist ontology. Three main themes were identified. Theme One encompassed participants’ grounding their understanding of ‘support’ {{in the context of their}} experiences of HT. Multiple intersecting forms of inequality and discrimination and the deceptive nature of HT were highlighted. Theme Two involved participants’ accounts of both the injuries sustained from their experiences of HT and those perpetuated by their current experiences in the NRM. The third theme related to participants’ hope that their experience of multiple injustice could be realised, recognised and understood in order to prevent and protect themselves and others from further harm. Based on the analysis, implications for future research, policy and practice are considered. This research argues that clinical psychology needs to fulfil its legislative duty to address the health of survivors of HT within a human rights and violence against women framewor...|$|E
40|$|Child {{trafficking}} {{has been}} conceptualised as ‘modern day slavery’. Slavery {{has been held}} up as the worst possible exploitation in human history (Lee, 2007). For more than 20 years UK governments have ratified United Nation Conventions and Protocols and rescheduled laws {{in its effort to}} eradicate this crime. However, despite such political commitment, in reality thousands of British children are still victims to internal trafficking for sexual exploitation in the UK today. Over the last 10 years the UK government has employed agencies, {{in the shape of the}} UK Human Trafficking Centre (UKHTC), the <b>National</b> <b>Referral</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (NRM) and the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre (CEOP). Each of these organisations have the specialised framework of identifying trafficked children (and adults), and estimating the scale of the problem. However, in each of the current reports delivered by these agencies, there is little or no statistical data and recognition for British national children (CEOP, 2010; HM Government, 2011; SOCA, 2012). The aim of this study was to try and seek out ‘why there is lack of recognition for British children who are victim to internal trafficking for sexual exploitation?’ By carrying out an analysis of academic, media and journal text and interviewing policing bodies and an NGO, who have direct experience with this subject matter, some quite alarming revelations were revealed. These include the covert nature of the crime; child protection professionals and the police not understanding the definition of ‘human trafficking’ as set out in the Palermo Protocol (2000); police officers not recording incidents of children being internally trafficked; police recording sexual exploitation as sexual abuse; no statutory responsibility of the police to pass information on trafficked children to either the UKHTC or the NRM; and the lack of police resources to deal with the situation. As such, this study presents that the internal trafficking of British children is not only a crime against humanity, but also a crime in which the UK government and its agencies appear to ignore...|$|E
