40|$|Pool boiling {{experiments}} for nanocoatings (or nanostructured surfaces) {{show that}} despite the lower thermal conductivity values than carbon, silicon yielded higher values of CHF (critical heat flux). Subsequently numerical studies showed that the interfacial thermal resistance (Kapitza resistance or ?R_(k) ?) between a <b>nanofin</b> and fluid molecules is the dominant component of the thermal impedance network. The values of R_(k) for silicon were predicted to be ~ 1000 times smaller than that of carbon in these numerical simulations. Since the total thermal impedance of silicon nanofins is {{lower than that of}} carbon they cause higher levels of enhancement of CHF. Surface adsorption of the liquid molecules on a <b>nanofin</b> results in the formation of dense ?compressed phase? which in turn induces thermal capacitance and diodic behavior. This is termed as the ?<b>nanofin</b> effect?: which implies that CHF is more sensitive to R_(k) than the thermal conductivity of the <b>nanofin.</b> Hence, the objective {{of this study was to}} verify the <b>nanofin</b> effect. Experimental and numerical investigation of transport phenomena during pool boiling were performed in this study for liquid subcooling of 0 ?, 5 ? and 10 ? on horizontal planar heater configuration. Surface temperature was measured using nanosensor (Thin Film thermocouple or ?TFT?) arrays. Heater surfaces (with or without nanofins of different heights) were composed of ceramic, oxide and metal surfaces. The nanofins were fabricated using Step and Flash Imprint Lithography (SFIL). Contact angle was measured both before and after the experiments. Nucleate pool boiling heat transfer was enhanced with increase in pillar height. Numerical predictions for R_(k) obtained from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were found to be consistent with the level of heat flux enhancement observed in the experiments for the different <b>nanofin</b> configurations. Hence this study demonstrates that R_(k) is the more dominant parameter for heat transfer enhancement during pool boiling ? compared to the thermal conduction resistance (or material properties) of the <b>nanofin</b> itself. As an outcome of these investigations future topics of research are also proposed (such as, using temperature nano-sensors for the investigation of controlled fouling on pool boiling phenomena for heaters with micro/nano-structured surfaces) ...|$|E

3000|$|In this study, {{we first}} {{investigated}} the thermal conductivity of SW-CNTs {{by means of}} classical non-equilibrium MD using both simplified one-dimensional and fully three-dimensional models. Next, based on the latter results, we {{have focused on the}} boundary conductance and thermal efficiency of SW-CNTs used as <b>nanofins</b> within water. More specifically, toward the end of computing the boundary conductance α, two different approaches have been implemented. First, α = αst was estimated through a fitting procedure of results by steady-state MD simulations and a simple one-dimensional continuous model. Second, cooling of SWNT (at TCNT [...]) within water (at Tw) was accomplished by NVE simulations. In the latter case, the time constant τd of the temperature difference (TCNT - Tw) dynamics enables us to compute α = αtr. Numerical computations do predict pretty high thermal conductance at the interface (order of 107 W·m- 2 ·K- 1), which indeed makes CNTs ideal candidates for constructing <b>nanofins.</b> We should stress that, consistently with our results αst> αtr, it is reasonable to expect that αst represents the upper limit for the thermal boundary conductance, because (in steady-state simulations) water is forced by the thermostat to the lowest temperature at any time and any position in the computational box. Finally, it is worthwhile stressing that, following the suggestion in [46], all {{the results of this study}} can be generalized to different fluids using standard non-dimensionalization techniques, upon a substitution of the parameterization (ϵCO, σCO) representing a different Lennard-Jones interaction between SWNT and fluid molecules.|$|R
40|$|Scaling of CMOS towards its {{ultimate}} limits, where quantum effects and atomistic variability due to fabrication, along with recent emphasis on heterogeneous integration of non-digital devices {{for increasing the}} functional diversification presents us with fundamentally new challenges. A comprehensive understanding of design and operation of these nanoscale transistors, and other electronic devices like RF-MEMS, requires an insight into their electronic and mechanical properties that are strongly influenced by underlying atomic structure. Hence, continuum descriptions of materials and use of empirical models at these scales become questionable. This increase in complexity of electronic devices necessitates an understanding at a more fundamental level to accurately predict the performance and reliability of these devices. The objective of this thesis is to outline the application of multiscale predictive modeling methods, ranging from atoms to devices, for addressing these challenges. This capability is demonstrated using two examples: characterization of (i) dielectric charging in RF-MEMS, and (ii) transport properties of Ge-nanofins. For characterizing the dielectric charging phenomenon, a continuum dielectric charging model, augmented by first principles informed trap distributions, is used to predict current transient measurements across {{a broad range of}} voltages and temperatures. These simulations demonstrate using ab initio informed model not only reduces the empiricism (number of adjustable parameters) in the model but also leads to a more accurate model over a broad range of operating conditions, and enable the precise determination of additional material parameters. These atomistic calculations also provide detailed information about the nature of charge traps and their trapping mechanisms that are not accessible experimentally; such information could prove invaluable in defect engineering. The second problem addresses the effect of the in-homogeneous strain profiles, inherent in strain-engineered Ge <b>nanofins,</b> on their transport properties. Fully atomistic simulations, involving a combination molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles based force-fields and semi-empirical tight binding calculations, coupled with linearized Boltzmann model are used to calculate the hole transport properties of realistic Ge <b>nanofins</b> (heights 5 - 15 nm and widths 5 nm- 40 nm). Our simulations predict the technological limit of phonon limited hole mobility improvement in Ge channel PMOS devices (H 3 ̆c 15 nm) and present geometric guidelines for patterning <b>nanofins</b> to engineer high performance uniaxial devices conducive to the existing top-down fabrication approaches. From these calculations, we demonstrate that realistic modeling of the devices requires a reduction in the empiricism of fitting parameters and incorporation of new multi-scale, multi-resolution approach spanning across various spatial and temporal scales. Such physics based predictive multiscale models facilitate an integrated approach for rapid development and pave the way for designing new advanced materials and devices. ...|$|R

40|$|Silicon based CMOS {{technology}} has seen continuous scaling of device dimensions for past three decades. There {{is a lot}} of focus on incorporating different high mobility channel materials and new device architectures for post-Si CMOS logic technology, making it a multifaceted problem. In this thesis some of the multiple challenges concerning new CMOS technologies are addressed. High carrier mobility alloyed channel materials like SiGe and InGaAs suffer from scattering due to disorder called, alloy scattering. The current theory of alloy scattering present in literature/text books can be called rudimentary at the best due to lack of a strong theoretical foundation and/or use of fitting parameters to explain experimental measurements. We present a new atomistic approach based on tight-binding parameters to understanding the alloy disorder. Using this approach we are able to provide new insights into the theory of alloy scattering and explain the experimental measurements in bulk SiGe and InGaAs that were till now based on just fitting parameters. With an updated understanding of alloy scattering, hole mobility in SiGe nanowires is calculated using a linearized Boltzmann formalism. Bulk Ge exhibits high hole mobility makeing it ideal for PMOS devices. Nano patterning of Ge/SiGe leads to Ge <b>nanofins</b> with both uniaxial and biaxial strain components, making it a device architecture design problem. Fully atomistic simulations involving molecular dynamics (ReaxFF force field) based relaxation for strain relaxation; tight-binding based bandstructure calculations and a linearized Boltzmann transport model for mobility calculations are performed. Final phonon mobility calculations reveal nearly 3. 5 X improvements compared to biaxial strained Ge in Ge <b>nanofins</b> with width reduction. High electron mobility III [...] V 2 ̆ 7 s are projected to be a material of choice for post-Si NMOS. These low electron mass materials suffer from the 2 ̆ 7 DOS bottleneck 2 ̆ 7 issue. Transistor designs based on using mixed Gamma-L valleys for electron transport are proposed to overcome the density of states (DOS) bottleneck. Improved current density over Si is demonstrated in GaAs/AlAsSb, GaSb/AlAsSb, and Ge-on-Insulator-based single gate thin-body n-channel transistors. Finally, a critical question {{that has to do with}} scaling is - How small a useful MOS transistor can be? As transistor channel lengths are scaled to lengths shorter than Lg 3 ̆c 8 nm, direct source-drain tunneling starts to limit the transistor operation. Scaling approaches needed in this tunneling dominated regime are discussed using atomistic quantum mechanical simulations. ...|$|R
3000|$|This article investigates, by {{molecular}} mechanics {{based on}} force fields (MMFF), the thermal performance of <b>nanofins</b> made of single wall CNTs (SW-CNTs). The SW-CNTs were selected {{mainly because of}} time constraints of our parallel computational facilities. The following analysis can be split into two parts. First of all, the heat conductivity of SW-CNTs is estimated numerically by both simplified model (section [...] "Heat conductivity of single-wall carbon nanotubes: a simplified model", where this approach is proved to be inadequate) and a detailed three-dimensional model (section [...] "Heat conductivity of single-wall carbon nanotubes: detailed three dimensional models"). This allows one to appreciate the role of model dimensionality (and harmonicity/anharmonicity of interaction potentials) in recovering standard heat conduction (i.e., Fourier's law). This first step is used for validation purposes in a vacuum and for comparison with results from literature. Next, the thermal boundary conductance between SW-CNT and water (for the sake of simplicity) is computed by two methods: the steady-state method (section [...] "Steady-state simulations"), mimicking ideal cooling by a strong forced convection (thermostatted surrounding fluid), and the transient method (section [...] "Transient simulations"), taking into account only atomistic interactions with the local fluid (defined by the simulation box). This strategy allows one to estimate a reasonable range for the thermal boundary conductance.|$|R

However, today, normal computational fluid dynamics (CFD) investigation is still playing a dominant role in this area. Khanafer et al. [22] found the water heat transfer rate in a two-dimensional enclosure could be substantially increased by adding more copper nanoparticles (ϕ was up to 20 %). Oztop and Abu-Nada [23] found natural heat transfer enhancement by using Al 2 O 3 /water, TiO 2 /water and Cu/water nanofluids (ϕ was up to 20 %) in two-dimensional rectangular enclosures with different aspect ratios. Furthermore, the enhancement was more pronounced at a low aspect ratio than at a high aspect ratio. Aminossadati and Ghasemi [24] reported that adding copper (Cu), silver (Ag), Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 nanoparticles (ϕ was up to 20 %) could improve cooling performance of pure water in a bottom-heated two-dimensional enclosure, especially when the Rayleigh number was low. Ghasemi and Aminossadati [25] reported a larger CuO/water nanofluid volume fraction (ϕ[*]=[*] 1 %[*]~[*] 4 %) led to Nusselt number enhancement in a two-dimensional triangular enclosure. Oueslati et al. [26] found nanofluid natural heat convection enhancement in a two-dimensional cavity when the volume fraction of Al 2 O 3, TiO 2 and Cu nanoparticles was lower than 5 %. Ternik et al. [27] examined the heat transfer enhancement of water-based gold (Au), Al 2 O 3, Cu and TiO 2 nanofluids (ϕ was up to 10 %) in a two-dimensional cavity. They indicated that the average Nusselt number was an increasing function of nanofluid volume fraction.|$|R

30|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry has followed Moore's law for over 30 years with gate dimensions of transistors approaching the nanometer scale (< 100 nm) [1]. The <b>nanofin</b> channels that are partly wrapped around these gates offer more effective control {{than that in}} traditional planar devices [2]. InAs is a direct-bandgap transition semiconductor material with high electron mobility [1 – 4]. InAs on a Si substrate is expected to allow side-by-side integration of InAs optoelectronics with conventional Si-based {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} products using monolithic epitaxial technology [1 – 8]. Unfortunately, the hetero-epitaxy of InAs nanofins deposited on Si presents challenges, including the dislocations on the <b>nanofin</b> surface and positioning of the <b>nanofin.</b> These dislocations are generated due to an 11.6 % lattice constant mismatch (aSi = 5.43 Å, aInAs = 6.06 Å), thermal expansion coefficient mismatch, and polarity mismatch [6 – 8]. For a zinc-blende structure deposited on a diamond structure, the dislocations generated near the InAs/Si interface, such as mistfit dislocations, threading dislocations, and antiphase domain boundaries, are annihilated or multiplied during the epitaxial process [6 – 19]. A previous report indicated that a threading dislocation density above 107 cm− 2 for a 900 -nm-thick epilayer decreased to 106 cm− 2 due to the self-annihilation of dislocations when the film thickness was increased to more than 4 μm for a III-V epilayer deposited on a Si substrate [8, 18]. A III-V epilayer on a miscut Si (001) substrate has fewer threading dislocations and antiphase domain boundaries than those of an epilayer on an untilted Si (001) substrate [6, 17]. Previous studies have attempted to reduce the dislocation density for a III-V epilayer deposited on a Si (001) substrate using methods such as thermal cycle annealing and the utilization of short-period strained intermediate-layer superlattices [6 – 10]. During thermal cycle annealing treatment, an epilayer is subjected to large temperature oscillations and thus periodically switches between the compressed and tensile states, reversing the motion of the dislocations. However, thermal cycle annealing processes are time-consuming. Strained intermediate-layer superlattices effectively decrease the threading dislocation density by generating additional stress, but their insertion leads to poor reproduction. In previous reports, the density of dislocations in an epilayer deposited on a planar Si substrate could be decreased by about two orders of magnitude by mixed thermal cycle annealing steps and strained intermediate-layer superlattice epitaxial growth processes [6 – 10]. An alternative technology for effectively reducing dislocation density is a kind of selective epitaxial growth on patterned Si substrate, which has the capability to produce a low-threading-dislocation surface using a simple epitaxial growth process. Yamaguchi et al. reported a model for the etching-pit density that could be reduced as the pattern trench width decreases [19].|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to study forced convective heat transfer of de-ionized water (DI water) and aqueous nanofluids flowing in a microchannel. An array of temperature nanosensors, called ?Thin Film Thermocouples (TFT) ?, was utilized for performing the experimental measurements. TFT arrays were designed (which included design of photomask layout), microfabricated, packaged and assembled for testing with the experimental apparatus. Heat removal rates from the heated surface to the different testing fluids were measured by varying the coolant flow rates, wall temperatures, nanoparticle material, nanoparticle morphology (shape and nanoparticle size) as well as mass concentrations of nanoparticles in the coolants. Anomalous thermal behavior was observed in the forced convective heat transfer experiments. Precipitation of the nanoparticles on the heat exchanging surface was monitored using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX). Isolated precipitation of nanoparticles is expected to cause formation of ?<b>nanofins?</b> leading to enhancement of surface area and thus resulting in enhanced convective heat transfer to the nanofluid coolants. However, excessive precipitation (caused due to the agglomeration of the nanoparticles in the nanofluid coolant) causes scaling (fouling) of the heat exchanging surfaces and thus results in degradation of convective heat transfer. This study shows that the surface morphology {{plays a crucial role}} in determining the efficacy of convective heat transfer involving suspensions of nanoparticles in coolants (or nanofluids).

Logical extensions of this study were explored and future directions were proposed. Preliminary experiments to demonstrate feasibility showed significant enhancement in the flow boiling heat flux values for nanofluids compared to that of pure solvent (DIW).

40|$|Recent advancements in {{fabrication}} techniques allow {{construction of}} nanostructures with well-defined features in nanometres scale. Tiny nanostructures that have features below {{the resolution of}} optical diffraction limit can now {{be made in the}} laboratory. The specific properties of those nanostructures with specific properties made from variety of materials allow us to study and explore many different properties that have never been observed while they are in bulk. One such phenomenon is localised surface plasmon resonance effect, which is exhibited by certain materials when in nanometric size. Their peculiar interaction with light is {{in such a way that}} the optical properties such as reflection and transmission deviate from typical characteristics and change according to the material involved and their shapes. Furthermore, this effect could also enhance the electric field in a specific area of the structure. 	This thesis is motivated by the attractiveness of the tunability of localised surface plasmon resonance and aims at exploring those properties by fabricating multiple types of nanostructures through a low-cost and versatile technique called nanosphere lithography. By improving the technique and combining with other fabrication techniques (such as oxygen plasma etching and argon ion milling), a large variety of nanostructures with hexagonal lattice like as nanocones, nanopencils, and <b>nanofins</b> arrays have been successfully created. Among them, three main types of nanostructure were selected for detailed study: nanotriangle, nanodisc, and nanohole-disc arrays. The distance between the adjacent nanoparticles were changed in those structures and strong interparticle coupling behaviours were observed as the distance between them becomes shorter. 	Current portable biosensing devices for in vitro studies are limited by the sensitivity limit of the detector, the poor quality of emitters and the size of the devices. In this thesis, the application of localised surface plasmon resonance for near infrared in vitro biosensing is explored. This is achieved through a mechanism called metal enhanced fluorescence. The techniques take advantage of the high electrical field strength and the resonance condition of the plasmon to enable a fluorophore to achieve brighter emission. The greater the resonance and electrical field are, the greater the emission amplification would be. Such effect makes it highly attractive for near infrared in vitro studies, which benefits from high optical penetration of common biology components such as water and lipids, but suffer from poor emission of existing fluorophores. Thus, enhancement of the emission signals through metal enhance fluorescence mechanism is an attractive route to obtain better signal to noise ratio in medical diagnostic, and improve detectability while at the same time reduce the need of a high sensitivity detector which can be costly and large in size. The three chosen nanostructures, i. e. nanotriangular arrays, nanodisc arrays and nanohole-disc arrays have shown marked enhancement in the emission of attached fluorophores up to 83 x, 235 x, and 411 x respectively, making them highly attractive nanostructures for such application.

30|$|A novel {{nanofabrication}} technique {{which can}} produce highly controlled silicon-based nanostructures in wafer scale {{has been proposed}} using a simple amorphous silicon (α-Si) material as an etch mask. SiO 2 nanostructures directly fabricated can serve as nanotemplates to transfer into the underlying substrates such as silicon, germanium, transistor gate, or other dielectric materials to form electrically functional nanostructures and devices. In this paper, two typical silicon-based nanostructures such as nanoline and <b>nanofin</b> have been successfully fabricated by this technique, demonstrating excellent etch performance. In addition, silicon nanostructures fabricated above can be further trimmed to less than 10  nm by combing with assisted post-treatment methods. The novel nanofabrication technique will be expected a new emerging technology with low process complexity and good compatibility with existing silicon integrated circuit and {{is an important step}} towards the easy fabrication {{of a wide variety of}} nanoelectronics, biosensors, and optoelectronic devices.|$|E
40|$|Nanofluids are {{suspensions}} of nanoparticles and fibers {{which have}} recently {{attracted much attention}} due to their superior thermal properties. Here, nanofluids are studied {{in the sense of}} nanofins transversally attached to a surface, so that dispersion within a fluid is mainly dictated by design and manufacturing processes. We focus on single carbon nanotubes thought as nanofins to enhance heat transfer between a surface and a fluid in contact with it. To this end, we first investigate the thermal conductivity of those nanostructures by means of classical non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Next, thermal conductance at the interface between a single wall carbon nanotube (<b>nanofin)</b> and water molecules is assessed by means of both steady-state and transient numerical experiments. Numerical evidences suggest a pretty favorable thermal boundary conductance (order of $ 10 ^{- 7 }$ $[W m^{- 2 } K^{- 1 }]$) which makes carbon nanotubes ideal candidates for constructing nanofinned surfaces.

40|$|The {{limitation}} of hot spot cooling in microchips represents an important hurdle for the electronics industry to overcome with coolers yet {{to exceed the}} efficiencies required. Nanotechnology-enabled heat sinks that can be magnetophoretically formed onto the hot spots within a microfluidic environment are presented. CrO 2 nanoparticles, which are dynamically chained and docked onto the hot spots, establish tuneable high-aspect-ratio nanofins for the heat exchange between these hot spots and the liquid coolant. These nanofins can also be grown and released on demand, absorbing and releasing {{the heat from the}} hot spots into the microfluidic system. It is shown that both high aspect ratio and flexibility of the fins have a dramatic effect on increasing the heat sinking efficiency. The system has the potential to offer a practical cooling solution for future electronics. An efficient heat transfer technique for cooling microchips is developed using dynamic <b>nanofin</b> heat sinks. CrO 2 nanoparticles are magnetically chained and docked onto hot spots, establishing high aspect ratio and flexible nanofins to facilitate the heat exchange between those spots and the liquid coolant.

40|$|Metalenses {{can achieve}} diffraction-limited {{focusing}} through localized phase {{manipulation of the}} incoming light beam. Because these structures are ultrathin, less than a wavelength, this {{has the potential of}} achieving ultrathin optical elements, with a thickness limited mainly by the mechanical strength of the transparent substrate. Recently proposed metalenses are based on either dielectric <b>nanofin</b> arrays, or nanoparticles of large number, which leads to severe manufacturing challenges. To overcome these challenges, this paper predicts a new type of metalens with concentric-nanoring topology, where the number and size of the nanorings are determined using an inverse design method. By focusing the electrical field energy at a specified position, the convex-like metalens is inversely predicted with desired numerical aperture and a diffraction-limited focal spot. The Poynting vector distribution found demonstrates the mechanism of the lensing function, in which optical vortices are generated in the nanorings to achieve a matching of the phase and impedance between the substrate and free space, and further, to form a spherical wavefront and enhance the transmission of the optical energy. The inverse design method can also be extended to predict an axicon-like metalens with focal beam. The improved manufacturability is concluded from the geometry of the concentric-nanoring configurations...|$|E
40|$|Directing' block {{copolymer}} (BCP) patterns {{is a possible}} option for future semiconductor device patterning, but pattern transfer of BCP masks is somewhat hindered by the inherently low etch contrast between blocks. Here, we demonstrate a 'fab' friendly methodology for forming well-registered and aligned silicon (Si) nanofins following pattern transfer of robust metal oxide nanowire masks through the directed self-assembly (DSA) of BCPs. A cylindrical forming poly(styrene) -block-poly(4 -vinyl-pyridine) (PS-b-P 4 VP) BCP was employed producing 'fingerprint' line patterns over macroscopic areas following solvent vapor annealing treatment. The directed assembly of PS-b-P 4 VP line patterns was enabled by electron-beam lithographically defined hydrogen silsequioxane (HSQ) gratings. We developed metal oxide nanowire features using PS-b-P 4 VP structures which facilitated high quality pattern transfer to the underlying Si substrate. This work highlights the precision at which long range ordered [similar] 10 nm Si <b>nanofin</b> features with 32 nm pitch can be defined using a cylindrical BCP system for nanolithography application. The results show promise for future nanocircuitry fabrication to access sub- 16 nm critical dimensions using cylindrical systems as surface interfaces are easier to tailor than lamellar systems. Additionally, the work helps to demonstrate the extension of these methods to a 'high [small chi]' BCP beyond the size limitations of the more well-studied PS-b-poly(methyl methylacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) system...|$|E
40|$|Ever more {{packing of}} {{transistors}} into integrated circuits (ICs), {{in order to}} achieve higher processing powers, signifies the problem of cooling of hot spots, which are generated during the operation of these electronic systems. Without any proper thermal management, the temperatures of these hot spots can significantly rise, thus reducing the expected life and reliability of the ICs. Many methods have been introduced as cooling solutions for such hot spots, including those which use microfluidics. Thermal management using microfluidics is still facing substantial challenges. Conventional microfluidic based systems are not effective in cooling denser ICs as they are limited due to the general low thermal conductivity of conventional liquid coolants. It has been demonstrated that incorporating suspended nanoparticles in liquid, and forming the so called the &ldquo;nanofluids&rdquo;, enhanced the overall thermal conductivity of the liquid. However, still many issues yet to be addressed including a comprehensive understanding of the cooling effect in microfluidics, concentration limitation of the nanoparticles that cannot exceed 10 % w/w, and the limitations posed by the materials used for making the microfluidic structure itself. In this research, the PhD candidate uses novel methods to tackle the aforementioned challenges for cooling hot spots using microfluidics. A novel infrared imaging method is used for a thorough understanding of the thermal effect of nanofluids in microfluidics. In the first stage, the PhD candidate demonstrated the heat transfer analysis of thermally conductive alumina (Al 2 O 3) nanoparticles suspended in distilled (DI) water for cooling a microfluidic channel. The thermal analysis of the suspensions was studied at various concentrations and at flow rates. The infrared camera, a non-contact device, allowed the observation of high resolution temperature profiling. In the second stage, the PhD candidate developed a novel concept to cool a hot spot in a microfluidic system based-on dynamically formed <b>nanofin</b> heat sinks from chromium oxide (CrO 2) nano-rods using a magnetophoretic technique. CrO 2 nanoparticles were chained and docked onto the hot spots; established tuneable high-aspect-ratio nanofins for exchanging heat between these hot spots and the liquid coolant. It showed that both high aspect ratio and flexibility of the nanofins had dramatic effects on increasing the heat sinking efficiency. In the third stage, the PhD candidate continued the previous work by investigating the <b>nanofin</b> heat sink structures using different morphologies of CrO 2 and iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3) magnetic nanoparticle. Results proved that the high thermal conductivity of the nanofins comprising CrO 2 significantly enhanced the heat exchange across the microchannel. Additionally, the smaller size of Fe 2 O 3 nanofins could transfer heat more efficiently in comparison to larger once. In the last stage, the PhD candidate introduced a solution for enhancing the thermal conductivity of polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) based microfluidics by introducing thermally conductive Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles, forming PDMS/Al 2 O 3 nanocomposites microfluidic systems. The nanocomposites were fully characterized for different concentrations of Al 2 O 3 in PDMS. The outomes suggested that incorporation of Al 2 O 3 at 10 % w/w, significantly enhanced the heat conduction from hot spots, while maintaining the flexibility and decreasing the specific heat capacity of the developed materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} nano-structured {{surfaces}} on pool {{boiling heat transfer}} is explored in this study. Experiments are conducted in a cubical test chamber containing fluoroinert coolant (PF 5060, Manufacturer: 3 M Co.) as the working fluid. Pool boiling experiments are conducted for saturation and subcooled conditions. Three different types of ordered nano-structured surfaces are fabricated using Step and flash imprint lithography on silicon substrates followed by Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) or Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE). These nano-structures consist of a square array of cylindrical nanofins with a longitudinal pitch of 1 mm, transverse pitch of 0. 9 mm and fixed (uniform) heights ranging from 15 nm ? 650 nm for each substrate. The contact angle of de-ionized water on the substrates is measured {{before and after the}} boiling experiments. The contact-angle is observed to increase with the height of the nano-fins. Contact angle variation is also observed before and after the pool boiling experiments. The pool boiling curves for the nano-structured silicon surfaces are compared with that of atomically smooth single-crystal silicon (bare) surfaces. Data processing is performed to estimate the heat flux through the projected area (plan area) for the nano-patterned zone as well as the heat flux through the total nano-patterned area, which includes the surface area of the fins. Maximum heat flux (MHF) is enhanced by ~ 120 % for the <b>nanofin</b> surfaces compared to bare (smooth) surfaces, under saturation condition. The pool boiling heat flux data for the three nano-structured surfaces progressively overlap with each other {{in the vicinity of the}} MHF condition. Based on the experimental data several micro/nano-scale transport mechanisms responsible for heat flux enhancements are identified, which include: ?microlayer? disruption or enhancement, enhancement of active nucleation site density, enlargement of cold spots and enhancement of contact angle which affects the vapor bubble departure frequency...|$|E
