25|$|In Week 2, {{the team}} {{traveled}} to St. Louis where they lost 24-22. A major defensive loss was suffered when Brian Orakpo went {{down from a}} tear to his left pectoral muscle. Despite widespread complaints from Redskins fans and players about the Rams playing dirty, there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> {{move on to the}} home opener against Cincinnati. The game started on a bad omen when the Bengals threw a 76-yard TD pass on the opening drive. Although the Redskins responded furiously and played another close match, they lost and injuries continued to pile up as CB Josh Wilson and WR Pierre Garçon went down. They would win their next game on a late game field goal at Tampa Bay, 24-22, after the Buccaneers made a 4th quarter comeback to take the lead. The Redskins only won one of their next five games, going into the bye week at 3-6.|$|E
500|$|On 22 June, Marlborough's forces linked up with Baden's Imperial {{forces at}} Launsheim. A {{distance}} of [...] {{had been covered}} in five weeks. Thanks to a carefully planned time-table, the effects of wear and tear had been kept to a minimum. Captain Parker described the march discipline – [...] "As we marched through the country of our Allies, commissars were appointed to furnish us with all manner of necessaries for man and horse ... the soldiers had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> pitch their tents, boil kettles and lie down to rest." [...] In response to Marlborough's manoeuvres, the Elector and Marsin, conscious of their numerical disadvantage with only 40,000 men, moved their forces to the entrenched camp at Dillingen on the north bank of the Danube. Marlborough could not attack Dillingen {{because of a lack}} of siege guns – he was unable to bring any from the Low Countries, and Baden had failed to supply any despite assurances to the contrary.|$|E

500|$|Johansson {{signed on}} to play Black Widow in Jon Favreau's Iron Man 2 (2010), {{a part of the}} Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Before she secured the role, she dyed her hair red to {{convince}} Favreau that she was right for the part, and undertook stunt and strength training preparing for the role. Johannsson said the character resonated with her, and she admired the superhero's human traits. The film earned $623.9million against its $200million budget, and received generally positive reviews from critics, but she was mostly criticized for her performance. Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph believed that she [...] "gets <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> pout [...] perform a few swivel kicks", and Matt Goldberg similarly thought that she had little to do but look attractive. In 2011, Johansson played the role of Kelly, a zookeeper in the family film We Bought a Zoo alongside Matt Damon. The film garnered mainly favorable reviews, and Anne Billson praised Johansson for bringing depth to a rather uninteresting character. Johansson earned a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: Drama nomination for her performance.|$|E
500|$|Striving {{towards the}} life beyond, Strindberg explained, he could permit {{nothing in the}} {{apartment}} that would lead the thoughts towards the earthly and material. In her comments in the Letters, Bosse described with loyalty and affection Strindberg's protectiveness and his efforts to bring his young wife with him along his own spiritual paths; nevertheless, she chafed under these efforts, pointing out that she herself, at 22, was not even remotely finished with this world. Increasingly agoraphobic, Strindberg attempted to overcome his anxieties and allow his young wife the summer excursions she longed for. He planned sunny drives in hired victorias, but often the mystical [...] "Powers" [...] which governed him intervened. [...] A crisis came as early as June 1901, when Strindberg arranged, {{and then at the}} last moment called off, a honeymoon trip to Germany and Switzerland. [...] Bosse wrote in the Letters that she had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> stay at home and choke down the tears while Strindberg attempted consolation by giving her a Baedeker [...] "to read a trip in".|$|E
500|$|When South Pacific {{opened in}} London in November 1951, the reviews were mixed. [...] London's Daily Express praised the music but disliked other {{elements}} of that show, writing, [...] "We got a 42nd Street Madame Butterfly, the weakest of all the Hammerstein-Rodgers musicals. The Daily Mail suggested, [...] "The play moved so slowly between its songs that it seemed more like South Soporific." [...] The Times applauded the songs but indicated that [...] "before the end the singing and the dancing have dwindled to almost nothing, while the rather sad little tale is slowly and conventionally wound up." [...] The Manchester Guardian, however, noted the anticipation {{in advance of the}} opening and concluded that [...] "there was no disappointment... the show bounces the audience and well deserves the cheers." [...] Drama critic Kenneth Tynan of The Spectator wrote that South Pacific was [...] "the first musical romance which was seriously involved in an adult subject... I have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> thank Logan, Rodgers and Hammerstein and climb up from my knees, a little cramped from the effort of typing in such an unusual position." ...|$|E

500|$|After the match, 150 guests {{attended}} a {{dinner at the}} Old Royal Hotel in central Birmingham [...] "in order that the shareholders {{and friends of the}} Small Heath Club might meet the players and congratulate them of their achievements and wish them still further success". Walter Hart, the club's chairman, spoke of the good character of the players, most of whom still worked at their own trades when not required for football, suggesting that [...] "a man who had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> loaf about from week's end to week's end was not ready for play, and such a mode of life was not conducive to good football". He praised the players' esprit de corps and pluck which had taken them {{to the top of the}} division, and encouraged them to resist the temptation to sign for other clubs, insisting that [...] "whatever money [...] made after providing things of necessity would come to the players and... the club could do as well for its players, if they only clung together, as any club in the country". In reply, captain Caesar Jenkyns agreed that the players' efforts meant they [...] "deserved all the praise that had been bestowed on them", and promised they would do their utmost to beat First Division club Burnley the following week in the FA Cup.|$|E
500|$|Modal jazz of {{this type}} was not unique to this album. Davis himself had {{previously}} used the same method on his 1958 Milestones album, the 58 Sessions, and Porgy and Bess (1958), on which he used modal influences for collaborator Gil Evans's third stream compositions. Also, the original concept and method had been developed in 1953 by pianist and writer George Russell. Davis saw Russell's methods of composition {{as a means of}} getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled [...] "thick." [...] Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, [...] "a return to melody." [...] In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of The Jazz Review, Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the chord progression predominant in bebop, stating [...] "No chords ... gives you a lot more freedom and space to hear things. When you go this way, you can go on forever. You don't have to worry about changes and you can do more with the [...] line. It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be. When you're based on chords, you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there's <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> repeat what you've just done—with variations. I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them." ...|$|E
500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E

He recalled, [...] "during the evening and wet days, I had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> look over my books". He had already read Lyell's Principles of Geology which opposed Lamarck by arguing that the fossil record showed no progress, and the 1845 second edition of Darwin's Journal of Researches which hinted at evolution by describing the [...] "wonderful relationship in the same continent" [...] between fossil and extant species, which would [...] "throw more light on the appearance of organic beings on our earth, and their disappearance from it, than any other class of facts", and how species unique to the Galápagos Islands [...] "all show a marked relationship with those of America" [...] despite its distance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{news of the}} Fall of Constantinople {{caused a}} {{widespread}} rebellion to break out in the Despotate of the Morea among the local Albanian population against the weak rule of the brothers Thomas and Demetrios Palaiologos. The Albanians appealed to Venice and offered to submit to its rule, which the Senate initially accepted; however, as a Venetian {{military presence in the}} Morea was sure to invite Ottoman invasion, the Venetians reconsidered their options, and on 21 June 1454 Cappello was appointed as ambassador to the Morea, and tasked with restoring peace between the Despots and their Albanian subjects, as well as to examine reported violations of Venetian rights and of the Republic's territories in the Morea (Modon, Coron, and Nauplia) by Thomas Palaiologos. Venetian suspicions of Genoese naval activity in the area also led to suggestions to try to secure various port towns—Patras, Vostitsa, Glarentsa, and Corinth—for Venice, to prevent them from coming under the control of [...] "another maritime power", but this proposal failed to pass in the Senate. Cappello arrived in Venice and began visiting the warring parties in an effort to reconcile them, but in the event, the revolt was ended through the intervention of the Ottoman warlord Turahan Bey in October 1454, who forced the Albanians to submit, and restored the feeble authority of the two Despots. The Senate was left with <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> order Cappello to return to Venice, which he died in February 1455.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{those who}} earned their {{living in the}} streets of London, the more criticized were the hackney coach drivers. Moreton defines them [...] "the scum of the people, and, {{generally}} speaking, the worst of rogues", robbing their customers on a regular basis, and often in league with highway robbers. Hackney coach travellers were generally at the mercy of their carriers, and even the simplest travel could easily turn into a real danger. Even the most [...] "honest" [...] among them were used to rework the city routes and rates as they pleased in order to increase their profits. Hackney coach drivers were so severely criticized for being rude and abusive, that in 1682 the Common Council had to pass an act for their regulation aiming: to limit their number, to establish a valid licence and a fair charge, and to set out places where they could wait for hire. Moreton brings the attention of the reader on a technicality that might explain why these drivers most of the time managed to walk unpunished. As a matter of fact, the renter of the coach rarely appears to be the actual driver (although they might be in league), therefore [...] "the penalty, which used to be on the renter, being now on the driver, the renter or owner of that figure is clear, and the driver has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> to be absent and laugh at the complainant". For this reason, the law needs to be amended so that both the driver and the renter (for Moreton equally guilty) might be accountable for extortion, insolence, or offences. In addition, the renter should be obliged to register and respond for the behaviour of the driver he rented his coach to.|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{one side}} of a table stands a grave-looking elderly gentleman with the ballot-box before him; on the other side sits a second still more grave, with an open book; in the book is written, each several number, on the margin, and {{opposite}} the number the name of the juror thereby denoted. The first grave gentleman shakes the box, puts in his hand, and takes out a card, from which he reads the number—then the other grave gentleman turns to that number in the book, and pronounces the name of the juror so numbered, whose name and address are then taken down as one of the forty-eight; and this process is repeated forty-eight times... it is said—I say nothing, but it is said—that those two gentlemen know each juror just as well by his number as by his name: and so, when the first takes out a card and finds 253, for example, written on it—if he knows that 253 would vote for the people, and against the Crown, it is said he gives out (as solemn as he looks), not 253, but, say, 255, or some loyal number; and thus a safe man is put on the list. Or, if anyone is standing by, and has an opportunity of seeing the card, he cries 253, and winks, or otherwise telegraphs to this other grave gentleman. Then the onus is upon the man with the book, who has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> call out a loyal man for the disloyal number, and so you have safe voters still. They never make the mistake, these elderly gentlemen, of turning out the whole forty-eight all of the right sort there is no need: there is a margin to the extent of twelve: and so they generally leave about nine or ten dubious names amongst the forty-eight. The Crown has afterwards the right to strike off twelve peremptorily, without reason assigned, and always gets rid of the men who would vote for the people.|$|E
