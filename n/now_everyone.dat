[...] Burton joked, [...] "ever since I did Batman, {{it was like the}} first dark comic book movie. <b>Now</b> <b>everyone</b> wants to do a dark and serious superhero movie.

2500|$|Gould {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{acclaimed}} 20th-century classical musicians. His unique pianistic method, insight into the architecture of compositions, and relatively free interpretation of scores created performances and recordings that were revelatory to many listeners while highly objectionable to others. Philosopher Mark Kingwell writes that [...] "his influence is made inescapable. No performer after him can avoid the example he sets... <b>Now,</b> <b>everyone</b> must perform through him: he can be emulated or rejected, but he cannot be ignored." ...|$|E

2500|$|Haddon {{states on}} his website that, {{although}} he had read [...] "a handful of newspaper and magazine articles about, or by, people with Asperger's and autism" [...] in preparation for writing the book, he knows [...] "very little" [...] about Asperger's syndrome and that Christopher Boone is inspired by two different people. According to Haddon, none of these people can be labelled as having a disability. Haddon added that he [...] "slightly regret" [...] that the term Asperger's syndrome appeared {{on the cover of}} his novel. In 2010, in an interview with The Independent, he was described as [...] "now thoroughly irritated that the word Asperger's appeared on subsequent editions of the novel, because <b>now</b> <b>everyone</b> imagines that he is an expert and he keeps getting phone calls asking him to appear at lectures." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "A {{people that}} {{suffered}} for 2,000 years, {{that went through}} the Holocaust, arrives at its patrimony but is thrust into a renewed round of bloodshed, that is perhaps the road to annihilation. In terms of cosmic justice, that's terrible. It's far more shocking than what happened in 1948 to {{a small part of}} the Arab nation that was then in Palestine...We are the greater victims in the course of history and we are also the greater potential victim. Even though we are oppressing the Palestinians, we are the weaker side here. We are a small minority in a large sea of hostile Arabs who want to eliminate us. So it's possible than [...] when their desire is realized, everyone will understand what I am saying to you <b>now.</b> <b>Everyone</b> will understand we are the true victims. But by then it will be too late." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the 1984 season got underway, Boros' notoriety {{from his}} use of a {{computer}} became a distraction {{in the eyes of}} team management and baseball traditionalists. Longtime friend Phil Regan recalled, [...] "He received some criticism for using computers in the mid-1980s and <b>now</b> <b>everyone</b> in the game uses computers." [...] In their book on baseball's fascination with statistics, Alan Schwartz and Peter Gammons wrote:"Baseball's conservatives howled in horror. As 1984 neared, you'd think that George Orwell was in the press box: Almost every article on baseball and computers used a silly, futuristic lead, with machines replacing managers and robots turning double plays[...] [...] [...] Steve Boros woke up one morning as the standard bearer of baseball's on-field information revolution. After one year on the job, having been profiled in dozens of publications and all but cast as a circus freak, he became unpopular enough in his own clubhouse that he was fired midway through the 1984 season." ...|$|E
2500|$|The title {{originally}} started development under GRIN, who {{had developed}} the previous title. [...] When the company folded four months into development, Fatshark took over, having worked with GRIN previously on other games. [...] Some key employees worked with Fatshark following {{the closing of}} GRIN. [...] Simon Viklund, Creative Director on the first Rearmed {{was hired as a}} Creative Advisor to the Fatshark team. [...] Of his position with Fatshark, Viklund remarked [...] "They were taking over things mid-project and I worked as a creative advisor during the hand-over to tell them what they were looking at." [...] Viklund further stated that the original design for the game involved events beyond the existing plot. [...] "I wanted to start off there and end up in a city in the FSA where everyone can see a bionic fighting. [...] a nice way to convey that <b>now</b> <b>everyone</b> will see that bionics can't always be controlled." [...] He noted that this would be an event in which the public would notice the dangers of bionics and seek to outlaw them.|$|E

2500|$|The Byrds' drummer, Gene Parsons (no {{relation}} to Gram), contributed two songs to the album: [...] "Get Down Your Line", {{a reflection on}} the need for self-improvement, and [...] "B.B. Class Road", a lighthearted song about a road manager's life on tour with a rock band, co-written by The Byrds' roadie, Stuart [...] "Dinky" [...] Dawson. [...] For many years it was assumed that the lead vocal on [...] "B.B. Class Road" [...] was sung by Dawson himself, but Parsons eventually revealed in the early 1990s that it was actually him singing on the track. [...] Parsons went on to elucidate by stating [...] "I wanted Dinky to sing this song but Dinky insisted that I do it. Until <b>now,</b> <b>everyone</b> thought he did. I tried to sing it with an excess of testosterone in the true spirit of rock 'n roll." [...] Parsons further explained to The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan in 1997 [...] "I was imitating and taking on a different persona. Stuart and I collaborated and it's me growling and howling out the vocal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1987, Orbison was {{inducted}} into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album [...] "Born to Run": [...] "I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. <b>Now,</b> <b>everyone</b> knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison." [...] In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt [...] "validated" [...] by the honor. A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. They were joined by Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, James Burton, and k.d. lang. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: [...] "Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional." [...] The concert was filmed in one take and aired on Cinemax under the title it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the rebels}} {{had yet to}} {{completely}} surround Duchang, so Taishi Ci managed to sneak past the enemy at night and enter the fortress to meet Kong Rong. He asked Kong Rong to let him lead soldiers to fight their way out, but Kong refused and insisted on waiting for reinforcements. The rebels came closer day by day. Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan, Shandong), {{but no one had}} any idea on how {{to break out of the}} siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, [...] "The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress. Everyone thinks it is impossible to break out. It will be very difficult for you to break out no matter how courageous you are." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "When I was away, you treated my mother very generously. She feels grateful, hence she told me to help you. She knew that I know what I am doing, and that I can help you. <b>Now,</b> <b>everyone</b> says it is impossible to break out. If I were to agree with them, I will not be able to repay your kindness. Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We are in a very desperate situation. I hope you won't hesitate any longer." [...] Kong Rong agreed to let him break out of the siege.|$|E
