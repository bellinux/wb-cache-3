5|$|By the 4th century BCE Aristotle {{records that}} there were no {{restrictions}} on whom an heiress might marry. If she was <b>not</b> <b>married</b> during her father's lifetime or by directions in her father's will, her nearest next-of-kin was allowed to marry her wherever he chose.|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church calls {{all members}} to {{practise}} chastity {{according to their}} state in life. Chastity includes temperance, self-mastery, personal and cultural growth, and divine grace. It requires refraining from lust, masturbation, fornication, pornography, prostitution and, especially, rape. Chastity {{for those who are}} <b>not</b> <b>married</b> requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal chastity.|$|E
5|$|Courtly {{love was}} the eroticisation of love between the nobility. Emphasis {{was placed on}} {{restraint}} between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments, where knights would fight wearing a token from their lady, {{it could also be}} private and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of love between two people <b>not</b> <b>married</b> to each other, although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous– Henry I of England had over 20bastards for instance– but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.|$|E
5|$|Few {{people in}} London {{other than their}} close friends knew that the couple were <b>not</b> <b>married.</b> Hogg's family had heard rumours that he was {{planning}} to marry, and had been curious to know whom he had chosen. They were very upset after hearing of his plans for a union with Jane. His mother was unwilling to introduce Jane to their social circles as Mrs Hogg, which ensured that she would never visit them. Hogg did not enter his family's house in Durham for seven years after he informed them of his relationship with Jane. Word of their union spread throughout Durham, and Hogg stopped practising law there for some time because of the damage to his reputation. Several of their friends were supportive of their union. Mary Shelley particularly approved of their match, despite having earlier been jealous of the time Hogg had spent with Jane.|$|E

5|$|In {{classical}} Athenian marriages, {{husband or}} wife could legally initiate a divorce. The woman's closest male relative (who {{would be her}} kyrios if she were <b>not</b> <b>married)</b> could also do so, apparently even against the couple's wishes. After divorce, the husband was required to return the dowry or pay 18 percent interest annually so the woman's livelihood would continue and she could remarry. If there were children {{at the time of}} the divorce, they remained in their father's house and he remained responsible for their upbringing. If a woman committed adultery, her husband was legally required to divorce her. A married epikleros would be divorced so she could marry her nearest relative.|$|E
5|$|Nina's mother, Trixie, {{arrives in}} town, and Lou {{gives her a}} singing job at his pub as he fancies her. Nina is upset to learn that Trixie and Nick are no longer together, and, when Trixie tells {{her that she was}} <b>not</b> <b>married</b> to her father, Nina leaves for Bombay to see Nick. Trixie and Lou later marry. Nina returns a year later after {{becoming}} an actress in Bollywood. She goes to see Jack and tells him that she wants to be with him. She also visits Lou and gives him some money, as Trixie had left him bankrupt. Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) tells Nina that Jack needs to stay in Australia so he can sort himself out. Nina performs her last concert at Lou's Place, and she tells Jack that she will wait for him. Months later, Jack flies out to Los Angeles to be with Nina.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} elements of the painting is the ring on the model's ring finger. Resting on the mantle piece, it becomes a {{focal point of the}} composition. The ring was a device of which Whistler was conscious; it had not been present in The White Girl. Though he and Hiffernan were <b>not</b> <b>married,</b> the ring showed a development in how he represented her in his art; from prostitute in Wapping, to mistress in The White Girl, and finally a wife in The Little White Girl. At the same time, this development reflected Whistler's notion of his own position in the English art world: towards greater legitimacy. The ring is also an allusion to the Christian sacrament of marriage, which lends a religious aspect to the aestheticism that he and Swinburne were trying to develop.|$|E

Định enjoyed a reputation among the locals for his martial skills and knowledge of the military classics.

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is invited}} by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas {{with him to}} help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds it strange that Jack's fiancée Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are <b>not</b> <b>married.</b> To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never told him he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as she looks down on his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery to feel sorry for her thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone. After the announcement, Liz leaves and travels to White Haven, Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with her family.|$|E
