Reliable and robust data processing and information extraction must be performed onboard the spacecraft in order to reduce downlinked data to a reasonable volume.

40|$|The Nuclear Materials Identification System (NMIS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), {{although}} {{primarily designed}} for analyzing special nuclear material, {{is capable of}} identifying nonradiological materials {{with a wide range}} of measurement techniques. This report demonstrates four different measurement methods, complementary to fast-neutron imaging, which can be used for material identification: DT transmission, DT scattering, californium transmission, and active time-tagged gamma spectroscopy. Each of the four techniques was used to evaluate how these methods can be used to identify four materials: aluminum, polyethylene, graphite, and G- 10 epoxy. While such measurements have been performed individually in the past, in this project, all four measurements were performed on the same set of materials. The results of these measurements agree well with predicted results. In particular, the results of the active gamma spectroscopy measurements demonstrate the technique's applicability in a future version of NMIS which will incorporate passive and active gamma-ray spectroscopy.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent {{developments}} in open-source information technology are creating new opportunities for data fusion for <b>nuclear</b> nonproliferation <b>verification</b> applications, particularly when some aspect of that information includes a geospatial component. Those developments include enhanced “new media” data mining tools and techniques to derive cueing information for indications of previously unknown and hence undeclared activity, coupled with rapidly expanding commercial satellite imaging capabilities and constellations, and new means to efficiently access them. In just the past year, {{there has been a}} significant expansion in the number of tools available in the open source information toolkit to draw from structured and unstructured big data, inter alia news media, social media and trade data. New open-source geospatial tools continue to keep pace, making it increasingly easy to follow-up such derived information having a geospatial context. Commercial satellite imagery has already been proven to be an effective and accepted means for <b>nuclear</b> monitoring, <b>verification,</b> and mission planning for IAEA safeguards purposes; it is still a relatively new “open-source” technology for routine information collection and analysis. Commercial satellite imagery (and its requisite processing and analysis) is continuing to evolve and advance as a result of radically new improvements in terms of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions from increasingly diverse and rapidly growing international satellite constellations. Improved means of access to this multi-resolution imagery diversity (nearing ubiquity, providing near persistent global surveillance in near-real time) will increasingly also provide a new basis for open-source information augmentation with previously unexpected synergistic effects. This paper reviews some key elements of this open-source (r) evolution, updates earlier work on the subject by these authors, and explains (by way of a few exemplar cases) how this expanding and evolving open-source tool-kit is making it easier, in terms of time and cost, to derive and assess new nuclear nonproliferation relevant information.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the {{international}} community has negotiated a number of multilateral agreements on nuclear non-proliferation and arms control, including also provisions for the verification of compliance. Among the different verification measures, earth observation (EO) by scientific or commercial satellite imaging sensors has been considered as an important source of information. If the area of interest is not accessible, remote sensing sensors offer one of the few opportunities to gather almost real-time data over the area. The study reviews the technical progress in the field of satellite imaging sensors and explores the recent advances in satellite imagery processing and geoinformation technologies as to the extraction of significant observables and signatures of possible non-compliance to non-proliferation and arms control. Moreover, it discusses how satellite data and geoinformation technologies could be used complementary for confirming information gathered from other systems or sources. The study also aims at addressing legal and political aspects and the cost benefits of using satellite imagery in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>verification</b> procedure.

40|$|As {{part of a}} European Commission Support Programme Task to the IAEA, {{a survey}} of world trade data from open source has been conducted. A {{catalogue}} was produced to cover services offering data on trade on all categories of goods, both of statistical and transactional nature. Services on statistical data have a worldwide coverage and are provided, often for free, by international and governmental organizations, and statistical offices. Services on trade transactions may have a national or multi-national scope and are typically provided by private companies. The survey was motivated by the hypothesis that trade databases {{may be useful to}} support IAEA verification activities. Trade data may provide insights to support the verification of additional protocol declarations and nuclear material transfers as well as give indications of possible undeclared activities. Since trade data is indexed in data services by the Harmonized System (HS) nomenclature of goods, a prerequisite to use this type of data is to ¿map¿ items of interest to safeguards verification with HS categories. The paper reviews services available on world trade data with an emphasis on geographical and temporal coverage, type of data provided and accessibility.

40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{diversion}} of nuclear material as well as illicit production, transport and use of nuclear material we investigated in mobile techniques to detect and identify such material in the field as early as possible. For that purpose we use a highly sensitive gamma measurement system installed in a car. It consists of two large volume plastic scintillators, {{one on each side}} of the car, each scintillator with 12 l active volume, and two extreme sensitive high purity Germanium detectors with 57 cm² crystal diameter, cooled electrically. The measured data are processed immediately with integrated, appropriate analysis software for direct assessment including material identification and classification within seconds. The software for the plastic scintillators can differentiate between natural and artificial radioactivity, thus giving a clear hint for the existence of unexpected material. In addition, the system is equipped with highly sensitive neutron detectors. We have performed numerous measurements by passing different radioactive and nuclear sources in relatively large distances with this measurement car.
