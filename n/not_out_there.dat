25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
500|$|While many Star Trek episodes {{dealt with}} false deities, The Final Frontier {{is one of}} the few that, in the words of {{religious}} scholar Ross Shepard Kraemer, [...] "intentionally confronted and explored theological questions, including the existence of God." [...] Theologian Larry Kreitzer dubbed it the film most preoccupied with religious ideas. According to the film, centuries in the future, beliefs in Eden persist, even among other alien races such as the Klingons and Romulans. Moreoever, the view of God is homogenized— no one disputes Sybok's references to God as a [...] "he". Kreitzer finds that the film's theological interpretation is offered by Kirk's words: [...] "Maybe He [...] is <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> Bones. Maybe He's right here, in the human heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{filming of}} Lizzy Borden's movie Forced Entry, which {{included}} several simulated rapes, {{was covered in}} the PBS Frontline documentary American Porn which aired on February 7, 2002; the makers of the documentary were repulsed and walked off the set. Zicari was interviewed in the documentary; he defended the company's content and challenged Attorney General John Ashcroft {{to take action against}} him. Zicari stated in an interview for the program, [...] "We've got tons of stuff they technically could arrest us for. I'm <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> saying I want to be the test case. But I will be the test case. I would welcome that. I would welcome the publicity. I would welcome everything, to make a point in, I guess, our society". These scenes possibly led to the subsequent undercover operation by federal authorities.|$|E

2500|$|The monster was {{designed}} by artist Neville Page. He sought a biological rationale for the creature, though many of his ideas would not show up on screen. Page designed the creature as immature and suffering from [...] "separation anxiety". He compared the creature to a rampaging elephant, saying [...] "there's nothing scarier than something huge that's spooked". Page said of the creature's backstory, [...] "For me, {{one of the most}} key moments in our collective brainstorming was the choice to make the creature be something that we would empathize with. It is <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> just killing. It is confused, lost, scared. It's a newborn. Having this be a story point (one that the audience does not know), it allowed for some purposeful choices about its anatomy, movement and, yes, motivations". The creature was developed by visual effects supervisor Kevin Blank and Phil Tippett's company Tippett Studio. Blank described the intended goal of the creature, [...] "Rather than the monster having a personality , it's more of an entity or an event".|$|E
2500|$|Love's {{reckless}} stage presence {{during the}} tour became a media spectacle, drawing press from MTV and other outlets {{due to her}} unpredictable performances. While touring with Sonic Youth, Love got into a physical fight with Kathleen Hanna backstage at a 1995 Lollapalooza festival and punched her in the face. In an August 1995 band interview with Rolling Stone, drummer Patty Schemel formally came out as a lesbian, saying: [...] "It's important. I'm <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> with that fucking pink flag or anything, but it's good for other people who live somewhere else in some small town who feel freaky about being gay to know that there's {{other people who are}} and that it's okay." [...] Toward the end of the tour, the band released their first EP, titled Ask for It, in September 1995; it featured 1991 Peel session recordings, as well as covers of songs by Wipers and The Velvet Underground. The band performed its last show of the year on September 3, 1995 at the Molson Polar Beach Party in Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, Canada. The concert was a promotional event for the Molson Brewery, and also featured performances by Metallica, Veruca Salt, and Moist.|$|E
2500|$|The {{announcement}} in The Times of Cowan's forthcoming marriage in June 1911 indicates {{that his family}} was at that stage living at Stratford-upon-Avon and he therefore qualified to play cricket for Warwickshire by residence; he also played club cricket for Leamington Cricket Club. He played first-class cricket {{for the first time}} in a single match in 1909, appeared in five more games in 1910 and then played six times in Warwickshire's unexpected County Championship-winning season of 1911. In these games, his single innings of more than 50 came against Lancashire in 1911, when he made an unbeaten 51. Naval duties and war then meant he disappeared from first-class cricket for eight seasons, but he reappeared for Warwickshire in the 1919 season and, although the county had one of its worst-ever seasons, finishing bottom of the County Championship, Cowan had some individual success as a batsman, though his highest innings of the year came in a first-class match for a combined Army and Navy side against a [...] "Demobilised Officers XI", when he made 67 <b>not</b> <b>out.</b> <b>There</b> were further matches for Warwickshire in 1920 and 1921, when he occasionally captained the county side; in the match against Hampshire in 1920, he made 78 as an opening batsman and this was his highest first-class score, though it was of little avail in the face of a Hampshire first innings of 616 and Warwickshire lost by an innings.|$|E

60|$|The Director of Companies was our {{captain and}} our host. We four affectionately watched his {{back as he}} stood in the bows looking to seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is {{trustworthiness}} personified.

My husband got his company six months afterwards, and was killed three years later. My pension as his widow was not a large one, and when your uncle offered me the charge of his daughter I was very glad to accept it. He gave some idea of his plans for her. I thought they were very foolish, but when I saw that his mind was thoroughly made up I {{did not attempt to}} dissuade him. He said that when he came home to England (and he had no idea when that would be) he should have me here, as head of his establishment, and it would be given out that the child was his ward. I hoped that he would alter his mind later on, but, as you know, he never did." ...|$|E

But that’s not what Trump is doing. He’s not a rebel speaking unpopular truths to power. He’s not standing up for honest discussions of deeply contentious issues. He’s <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> defying rules handed down by elites to control what we say. All Trump’s defying is common decency.|$|E

5000|$|The {{decision}} to revert Princess Bubblegum to her original 18 year old self {{was met with}} contention on the Internet, with many fans noting that the decision merely reverted the show to the status quo. Ward expressed disregard for these opinions, as Herpich stated in the DVD commentary: [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> {{to give people a}} hard time. We're out there to make quality entertainment." [...] The point of Bubblegum reverting to 18 also was meant to be emphasize the idea of sacrifice, as well as the fact that the Candy Kingdom cannot function without her as ruler.|$|E
