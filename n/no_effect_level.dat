40|$|As part of {{a project}} {{designed}} to develop a framework for extrapolating acute central nervous system (CNS) effects of hydrocarbon solvents in animals to humans, experimental studies were conducted in rats and human volunteers in which acute CNS effects were measured and toxicokinetic data were collected. A complex hydrocarbon solvent, white spirit (WS) {{was used as a}} model solvent and two marker compounds for WS, 1, 2, 4 -trimethyl benzene (TMB) and n-decane (NDEC), were analyzed to characterize internal exposure after WS inhalation. Toxicokinetic data on blood and brain concentrations of the two marker compounds in the rat, together with in vitro partition coefficients were used to develop physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for TMB and NDEC. The rat models were then allometrically scaled to obtain models for inhalatory exposure for man. The human models were validated with blood and alveolar air kinetics of TMB and NDEC, measured in human volunteers. Using these models, it was predicted that external exposures to WS in the range of 344 - 771 mg/m 3 would produce brain concentrations similar to those in rats exposed to 600 mg/m 3 WS, the <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level</b> (NOEL) for acute CNS effects. Assuming similar brain concentration-effect relations for humans and rats, the NOEL for acute CNS effects in humans should be in this range. The prediction was consistent with data from a human volunteer study in which the only statistically significant finding was a small change in the simple reaction time test following 4 h exposure to approximately 570 mg/m 3 WS. Thus, the data indicated that the results of animal studies could be used to predict a <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level</b> for acute CNS depression in humans, consistent with the framework described above. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The University of North Texas Stream Research Facility (UNTSRF) was {{designed}} to examine contaminant impacts on effluent-dominated stream ecosystems. Stream mesocosms, fed municipal effluent from the City of Denton, TX, Pecan Creek Water Reclamation Plant (PCWRP), were treated with 0, 15 or 140 µg/L cadmium for a 10 -day study in August 2000. Laboratory toxicity test and stream macroinvertebrate responses indicated that cadmium bioavailability was reduced by constituents of effluent-dominated streams. The Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) for Cd was used to predict a 48 hour Cd EC 50 for Ceriodaphnia dubia of 280 µg/L in these effluent-dominated streams. This value is higher that an EC 50 of 38. 3 µg/L Cd and a 7 -day reproduction effect level of 3. 3 µg/L Cd generated for C. dubia in reconstituted laboratory hard water. These results support use of a cadmium BLM for establishing site-specific acute water quality criteria in effluent-dominated streams. Although not affected by 15 µg/L treatments, organisms accumulated Cd in 15 µg/L treated streams. Hence, over longer exposure periods, Cd accumulation may increase and a <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level</b> may be lower than the observed 10 -day <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level</b> of 15 µg/L. A toxicity identification evaluation procedure was utilized with in vitro and in vivo bioassays to identify estrogenic compounds in PCWRP effluent, previously identified to seasonally induce vitellogenin (VTG) in male fathead minnows. Steroids, nonylphenol ethoxylate metabolites, and other unidentified compounds were identified as causative effluent estrogens. These findings suggest that in vivo VTG bioassays {{should be used to}} confirm in vitro Yeast Estrogen Screening assay activity when effluents are fractionated or screened for estrogenicity. A subsequent 90 -day cadmium study was initiated to assess long-term effluent and cadmium effects on fish endocrine function. Juvenile fathead minnows were placed in UNTSRF pool sections of replicate streams treated with 0, 5, 20 or 80 µg/L Cd. Male VTG was induced at each treatment level, indicating that PCWRP effluent was estrogenic during fall 2001. 20 and 80 µg/L Cd treatments reduced male circulating estradiol levels and critical swimming performance.

The alkaloids of poppy {{are used in the}} production of medicines. Poppy seeds used as food may also contain considerable amounts of alkaloids, which raise the question of food safety. Morphine, codeine, thebaine and noscapine concentrations of poppy seed samples from the time period 2001 - 2010, and consumption data from two Hungarian surveys, carried out in 2003 and 2009 were evaluated. Exposure calculations were made for morphine intake both by point estimate and probabilistic methods, and the uncertainty of the calculated values was estimated. The point estimate for the acute consumer exposure, calculated using the 97. 5 percentiles of morphine concentration and of poppy seed consumption and taking into account the reduction of morphine content by processing, was 78. 64 µg(kgbw) - 1 day - 1 for adults, and 116. 90 µg(kgbw) - 1 day - 1 for children.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The primary {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to develop a QSAR model to estimate the <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level</b> (NOEL) of chemicals in humans using data derived from pharmaceutical clinical trials and the MCASE software program. We believe that a NOEL model derived from human data provides a more specific estimate of the toxic dose threshold of chemicals in humans compared to current risk assessment models which extrapolate from animals to humans employing multiple uncertainty safety factors. A database of the maximum recommended therapeutic dose (MRTD) of marketed pharmaceuticals was compiled. Chemicals with low MRTDs were classified as high-toxicity compounds; chemicals with high MRTDs were classified as low-toxicity compounds. Two separate training data sets were constructed to identify specific structural alerts associated with high and low toxicity chemicals. A total of 134 decision alerts correlated with toxicity in humans were identified from 1309 training data set chemicals. An internal validation experiment showed that predictions for high- and low-toxicity chemicals were good (positive predictivity> 92 %) and differences between experimental and predicted MRTDs were small (0. 27 – 0. 70 log-fold). Furthermore, the model exhibited good coverage (89. 9 – 93. 6 %) for three classes of chemicals (pharmaceuticals, direct food additives, and food contact substances). An additional investigation demonstrated that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of chemicals in rodents was poorly correlated with MRTD values in humans (R 2 = 0. 2005, n = 326). Finally, this report discusses experimental factors which influence the accuracy of test chemical predictions, potential applications of the model, and the advantages of this model over those that rely only on results of animal toxicology studies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{emergence}} of Anopheles populations capable of withstanding lethal doses of insecticides has weakened {{the efficacy of}} most insecticide based strategies of vector control and, has highlighted the need for developing new insecticidal molecules or, improving the efficacy of existing insecticides or abandoning those to which resistance has emerged. The use of petroleum products (PP) against mosquito larvae had an immense success during early programmes of malaria control, but these compounds were abandoned and replaced in the 1950 s by synthetic insecticides probably {{because of the high}} performances given by these new products. In the current context of vector resistance, it is important to elucidate the empirical use of PP by quantifying their efficiencies on resistant strains of Anopheles. Methods Larvae of Anopheles Ladji a local resistant strain were exposed to increasing concentrations of various PP (kerosene, petrol and engine oils) for 24 hours and the lethal activities recorded. The highest concentration (HiC) having no lethal activity (also referred as the NOEL or <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level)</b> and the lowest concentration (LoC 100) yielding 100 % mortality were rated for each PP on the Ladji strain. Prior to laboratory analysis, KAP studies were conducted in three traditional communities were insecticide resistance is clearly established to confirm the use of PP against mosquitoes. Results Laboratory analysis of petrol, kerosene and engine oils, clearly established their lethal activities on resistant strains of Anopheles larvae. Contrary to existing references, this research revealed that exposed larvae of Anopheles were mostly killed by direct contact toxicity and not by suffocation as indicated in some earlier reports. Conclusion This research could serve as scientific basis to backup the empirical utilisation of PP on mosquito larvae and to envisage possibilities of using PP in some traditional settings where Anopheles have developed resistance to currently used insecticides. </p...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} an association between exposure to 50 – 60 Hz magnetic fields (EMF) and childhood leukaemia. We conducted a pooled analysis based on individual records from nine studies, including the most recent ones. Studies with 24 / 48 -hour magnetic field measurements or calculated magnetic fields were included. We specified which data analyses we planned {{to do and how}} to do them before we commenced the work. The use of individual records allowed us to use the same exposure definitions, and the large numbers of subjects enabled more precise estimation of risks at high exposure levels. For the 3203 children with leukaemia and 10 338 control children with estimated residential magnetic field exposures levels < 0. 4 μT, we observed risk estimates near the <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level,</b> while for the 44 children with leukaemia and 62 control children with estimated residential magnetic field exposures ≥ 0. 4 μT the estimated summary relative risk was 2. 00 (1. 27 – 3. 13), P value = 0. 002). Adjustment for potential confounding variables did not appreciably change the results. For North American subjects whose residences were in the highest wire code category, the estimated summary relative risk was 1. 24 (0. 82 – 1. 87). Thus, we found no evidence in the combined data for the existence of the so-called wire-code paradox. In summary, the 99. 2 % of children residing in homes with exposure levels < 0. 4 μT had estimates compatible with no increased risk, while the 0. 8 % of children with exposures ≥ 0. 4 μT had a relative risk estimate of approximately 2, which is unlikely to be due to random variability. The explanation for the elevated risk is unknown, but selection bias may have accounted for some of the increase. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{personal}} {{cigarette smoking}} {{is the most}} important cause and modulator of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure could influence the course of the disease. Despite the importance of this question, the impact of SHS exposure on COPD health outcomes remains unknown. Methods: We used data from two waves of a population-based multiwave U. S. cohort study of adults with COPD. 77 non-smoking respondents with a diagnosis of COPD completed direct SHS monitoring based on urine cotinine and a personal badge that measures nicotine. We evaluated the longitudinal impact of SHS exposure on validated measures of COPD severity, physical health status, quality of life (QOL), and dyspnea measured at one year follow-up. Results: The highest level of SHS exposure, as measured by urine cotinine, was cross-sectionally associated with poorer COPD severity (mean score increment 4. 7 pts; 95 % CI 0. 6 to 8. 9) and dyspnea (1. 0 pts; 95 % CI 0. 4 to 1. 7) after controlling for covariates. In longitudinal analysis, the highest level of baseline cotinine was associated with worse COPD severity (4. 7 points; 95 % CI - 0. 1 to 9. 4; p = 0. 054), disease-specific QOL (2. 9 pts; - 0. 16 to 5. 9; p = 0. 063), and dyspnea (0. 9 pts; 95 % CI 0. 2 to 1. 6 pts; p < 0. 05), although the confidence intervals did not always exclude the <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level.</b> Conclusion: Directly measured SHS exposure appears to adversely influence health outcomes in COPD, independent of personal smoking. Because SHS is a modifiable risk factor, clinicians should assess SHS exposure in their patients and counsel its avoidance. In public health terms, the effects of SHS exposure on this vulnerable subpopulation provide a further rationale for laws prohibiting public smoking. © 2006 Eisner et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

During the same period we attempted, unsuccessfully, to repeat our own observation of weak uterotrophic activity in the rat for the sunscreen 3 -(4 -methylbenzylidene) camphor (4 MBC). Further evaluation led us to conclude that 4 MBC is uterotrophic only when the control uterine weights are {{at the low end}} of their normally encountered range. This led us to reevaluate our earlier mouse uterotrophic assay data for bisphenol A (BPA). Originally we had concluded that BPA gave irreproducible evidence of weak uterotrophic activity, but upon ordering the eight experiments we had conducted, according to decreasing control uterine weight, we confirmed reproducible weak uterotrophic activity for BPA when the control uteri were {{at the low end of}} their normal range.

40|$|Background The {{exceptional}} physical-chemical {{properties of}} carbon nanotubes have lead to {{their use in}} diverse commercial and biomedical applications. However, their utilization has raised concerns about human exposure that may predispose individuals to adverse health risks. The present study investigated the susceptibility to cardiac ischemic injury following a single exposure to various forms of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). It was hypothesized that oropharyngeal aspiration of MWCNTs exacerbates myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R injury). Methods Oropharyngeal aspiration was performed on male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice with a single amount of MWCNT (0. 01 - 100 μg) suspended in 100 μL of a surfactant saline (SS) solution. Three forms of MWCNTs were used in this study: unmodified, commercial grade (C-grade), and functionalized forms that were modified either by acid treatment (carboxylated, COOH) or nitrogenation (N-doped) and a SS vehicle. The pulmonary inflammation, serum cytokine profile and cardiac ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury were assessed at 1, 7 and 28 days post-aspiration. Results Pulmonary response to MWCNT oropharyngeal aspiration assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) revealed modest increases in protein and inflammatory cell recruitment. Lung histology showed modest tissue inflammation {{as compared to the}} SS group. Serum levels of eotaxin were significantly elevated in the carboxylated MWCNT aspirated mice 1 day post exposure. Oropharyngeal aspiration of all three forms of MWCNTs resulted in a time and/or dose-dependent exacerbation of myocardial infarction. The severity of myocardial injury varied with the form of MWCNTs used. The N-doped MWCNT produced the greatest expansion of the infarct at any time point and required a log concentration lower to establish a <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level.</b> The expansion of the I/R injury remained significantly elevated at 28 days following aspiration of the COOH and N-doped forms, but not the C-grade as compared to SS. Conclusion Our results suggest that oropharyngeal aspiration of MWCNT promotes increased susceptibility of cardiac tissue to ischemia/reperfusion injury without a significant pulmonary inflammatory response. The cardiac injury effects were observed at low concentrations of MWCNTs and presence of MWCNTs may pose a significant risk to the cardiovascular system...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{paper is}} part 1 of our twin {{articles}} on income reference points for Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA). Preventative costs based LCA systems, {{such as the}} EcoCost system and the Oiconomy system, need targets (performance reference points) to determine the marginal preventative costs, {{the costs of the}} most expensive measure that globally needs to be employed to reach the target. To extend the EcoCost system for social issues, targets are required for issues like fair wages and fair inequality of wages, issues for which no agreed standard, <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level</b> or target exists. One way of setting targets is to take best practices as benchmark, e. g. the practices of a group of best performing countries. The purpose of this part 1 article is to first develop a well-founded benchmark group of the 20 % best performing countries and thereafter propose a well-founded target for the issue of inequality for preventative costs based SLCA, which can also serve as performance reference point for SLCA in general and for other uses. In part 2, for the same purposes and using the same benchmark group, we propose targets for fair minimum wages for every country. Methods: A benchmark group of countries for the setting of targets was determined by an assessment of available country performance indicators, based on 5 criteria. Thereafter, we derived a proposal for a maximum inequality ratio based on existing democratically determined inequality ratios in the benchmark group. Results and discussion: The Sustainable Society Index–Human Wellbeing proved the best indicator for a country benchmark for preventative cost-based SLCA. Using the average of maximum democratically determined income differences in a benchmark group of countries determined by this index, a performance reference point for SLCA for the issue of fair inequality was derived and proposed, resulting in a maximum ratio of income differences for governmental institutions of 14. 1, for government ruled companies of 18. 3 and for industry of a factor 23. 8. Conclusions: It proved possible to derive a target for maximum inequality of wages, based on democratic choices in a benchmark group of the 20 % best performing countries. The target for governmental institutions may be called objective, and proposed augmentations for government ruled companies and industry, though value choices, seem reasonable for the consumer who requires prevention of all possible harm as consequence of his purchase choices and who, as a voter, contributes to governmental standards...|$|E

Investigation the impact of salinity on fertilisation utilised gametes of trout cod (M. macquariensis, Cuvier 1829) instead of M. peelii peelii. Studies were carried out in a controlled laboratory environment using test media prepared from commercial sea salt. The results showed that the eggs of the trout cod hatched only when fertilised and incubated in freshwater, and only larvae hatched in freshwater survived through the yolk absorption period of 12 days. Yolk utilisation efficiencies were not significantly different among the salinities of 0 - 0. 30 g/L. There was no effect of pre- or post- fertilising processes on the salinity tolerances of yolk-sac larvae. No larvae survived at salinities higher than 0. 30 g/L during the yolk utilisation period. Lethal salinity concentration in Trout cod and Murray cod larvae was exposure time dependent. The 1 day LC 50 of the larvae was 1. 97 and 2. 33 g/L respectively, compared with the 12 day LC 50 values of 0. 50 and 0. 35 g/L respectively. The threshold (<b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level)</b> salinities of larvae of Trout cod and Murray cod were 0. 46 and 0. 34 g/L respectively at 12 days exposure. The salinity sensitivities of fry of Murray cod were moderated by increasing pH between pH 6. 2 and 8. 8, and stimulated by increasing temperatures from 15 to 30 C. The optimal salinity was only slightly affected by temperature. The threshold and upper sublethal salinities varied slightly depending on feeding regime. The salinity sensitivities of fingerlings of Murray cod were: LC 50 = 13. 7 g/L; optimal salinity from 4. 6 to 5. 0 g/L; threshold salinity from 5. 9 to 7. 4 g/L, and upper sub-lethal salinity from 9. 2 to 9. 9 g/L - with the range in all cases affected by acclimation period salinity. The blood osmolality at LC 50 of the fingerlings was 444 mOsmol/kgH 2 O or equivalent to 14. 2 g/L, and the dehydration rate was 4. 8 %. The osmolality increased significantly in salinities higher than 9. 0 and 6. 0 g/L when fish were exposed for a period of 1 day and 41 days respectively. The oxygen consumption increased significantly in salinities higher than 8. 0 g/L. Distortion of the notochord and corrosive skin syndrome were major symptoms describing sub-lethal effects found in the embryos, and fry and fingerlings of Murray cod respectively. Noting the risks of extrapolating directly from laboratory to field conditions, it is predicted that when salinity in natural habitats increases above 0. 34 g/L a significant impact on Murray cod recruitment will result...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} years the {{clinical}} research has rapidly advanced towards {{the direction of}} pharmacogenetics, which {{is defined as the}} study of the role of inherited variation in drug response. It appeared that individuals respond significantly different to the same drug dose; the answer lies in our genes, the differences in our genes. However, {{we are not talking about}} inconspicuous differences in the reactions to the same drug dose, the range varies between death and <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level.</b> These differences are due to polymorphisms within the gene. When describing genetic polymorphisms, it is easiest to imagine two strands of DNA that differ in sequence rather than in shape. Single nucleotide polymorphisms involve only the change of single bases in the sequence. This type of polymorphism is the most common and extremely studied form of polymorphisms in genetic research. In our studies the existence of a variable number tandem repeat plays also an important role, the variation involves individual alleles that have different numbers of repeats. Arsenic is present in the drinking water in many parts of the world. In humans, arsenic is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, but it is not known as a trace element. Inorganic arsenic is methylated, and methylconjugation has been shown to be an important pathway for biotransformation of many drugs and neurotransmitters. In this study, our goal was to analyze the genetic variations of the human arsenic methyltransferase gene with the impacts on protein function. Inorganic arsenic is methylated during biotransformation, the enzyme catalyzing this process is the arsenic methyltransferase. We followed the model of the drug-metabolizing enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase The activity of this enzyme is known to be in human red blood cells and controlled by a common genetic polymorphism that also regulates the enzyme activity in all other tissues which have been analyzed. The studies in which I participated involved testing the hypothesis that individual variation in the sequence or structure of the arsenic methyltransferase gene might contribute to individual differences in arsenic methylation in vivo and result in individual variation in arsenic toxicity and carcinogenesis. To test this hypothesis, a genotype-to-phenotype, rather than a phenotype-to-genotype strategy was used to study arsenic methyltransferase pharmacogenetics. This study initially focused on the 5 ’-flanking region and the single nucleotide polymorphisms in the open reading frame of this gene. However, the project started with resequencing the human arsenic methyltransferase gene. When that was done, 26 polymorphisms were observed, 3 of which were nonsynonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphisms in the open reading frame. An enzyme assay was then optimized to test the possible functions of the coding single nuclotide polymorphisms and its expressed proteins. A variable number tandem repeat was also observed in the 5 ‘-untranslated region. A series of reporter gene constructs, incorporating portions of the 5 ’-flanking region as well as the 5 ‘-untranslated region, were used to identify the promotor of the gene and to study the possible functional implications of the variable number tandem repeat. In conclusion, we were able to prove that the differences in the methylation level are due to the polymorphisms in the arsenic methyltransferase gene. Furthermore, we showed that not only the open reading frame but also the region within the flanking region and untranslated region had an impact on the protein activity. A major challenge for the future will be to develop ways to translate the pharmacogenetic information of the human arsenic methyltransferase gene into meaningful clinical reality and individual patient treatment...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{potential}} of the heat shock protein 70 as an in vitro measure of toxicity. The heat shock response was analysed by one-dimensional electrophoresis and a range of immunological methods. The two cell lines used, mouse connective tissue (L 929) and normal rat kidney (NRK), were found to be extremely sensitive responding to a classic heat shock treatment. One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) combined with silver staining revealed the induction of a 70 kDa protein with only a 30 C increase in temperature. Western blotting identified this as the inducible isoform of heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70). Exposure to three metals cadmium, mercury and copper showed induction of hsp 70 coupled with a repression of normal protein synthesis. At the median lethal concentration (LC 50), measurement of hsp 70 revealed a more sensitive response than that of cell mortality as determined by the neutral red assay. Hsp 70 induction was significant at the <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>level</b> (NEL) determined by the neutral red assay as the concentration at which no cell mortality could be measured. Hsp 70 induction was also shown at the lowest observed effective concentration (LOEC). Measurement of hsp 70 revealed a more sensitive response for mixtures of the three metals than that of cell mortality. In addition, hsp 70 induction revealed toxin interaction that resulted in an additive response. The use of ELISA in conjunction with hsp 70 induction to measure in vitro toxicity revealed similar results to those found using one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Below the NEL hsp 70 induction was slightly higher for several of the metals suggesting that the ELISA assay was more sensitive. The use of immunocytochemistry in conjunction with hsp 70 induction to measure in vitro toxicity also revealed similar results to those found using one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The use of immunocytochemistry allows for qualitative and quantitative assessment of hsp 70 induction. This appears more suited to low level toxicity as above the LC 50 cell mortality becomes the greater response. Using this assay a heterogeneous response was observed at intermediate toxin concentrations. To assess the potential of hsp 70 induction as an in vitro measure of toxicity a novel compound 2 -Isobutyl piperidine was tested. Measuring the induction of hsp 70 revealed a more sensitive response than cell mortality. Significant hsp 70 induction was shown at the NEL and LOEC. Hsp 70 induction showed a more sensitive response than the neutral red assay, which is considered a very sensitive measure of cell mortality. Induction of hsp 70 at the NEL demonstrates the assays ability to identify sub lethal toxicity. The high level of induction at the LOEC demonstrates the sensitivity of the assay for measuring sub lethal toxicity. The repression of normal protein synthesis aids this assay by removing potentially interfering cellular proteins. Identifying toxin interaction suggests the assay could be applied to true environmental situations. The ability of hsp 70 induction to be used in conjunction with ELISA and immunocytochemistry methods to measure in vitro toxicity provides the opportunity to develop a routine automated assay. The use of hsp 70 induction to measure the toxicity of 2 -Isobutyl piperidine demonstrates the potential to assess the toxicity of newly synthesised compounds...|$|E

40|$|Punarnava Mandur is an iron {{containing}} classical Ayurvedic formulation {{which was}} studied for repeated dose oral toxicity study in Wistar rats for 90 days. Total 48 Wistar rats (24 male and 24 female) were {{selected based on}} the body weight and were randomly distributed into four groups followed by administration of Punarnava Mandur at the dose of 0, 90, 450, 900 mg/kg body weight for 90 consecutive days. Body weight, Weekly Feed and Water consumption, Clinical Chemistry, Hematology, Differential leukocyte Count, Reticulocyte count and Organ weights were recorded and analyzed statistically. At termination, rats were sacrificed, examined for gross pathological changes, organs were collected, weighed and processed for histopathological evaluation. There was <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> on body weights and feed consumption, no abnormal findings in the histopathological evaluation of high dose group animals but there was significant increase in weight of liver in females of high dose group as compared to control. Hence, the dose level 450 mg/kg of Punarnava Mandur was found as NOAEL (<b>No</b> Observable Adverse <b>Effect</b> <b>Level).</b> However, the NOEL (<b>No</b> Observed <b>Effect</b> <b>Level)</b> could not be established.
