When fed to uninfected chickens, monensin did not affect rate of gain to a significant degree in three of four replicates. Moreover, an analysis of the aggregate data did not indicate a significant difference in rate of gain between the uninfected group. POULTRY SCIENCE 53 : 770 - 772, 1974 MONENSIN has been shown to have a broad spectrum of activity against poultry coccidia in battery trials (Shumar...|$|E
