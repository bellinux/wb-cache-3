5|$|Bawdsey, {{right on}} the eastern coast in a {{relatively}} secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more protected location on the opening of hostilities had been identified long before the war. During a visit to his alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short <b>notice.</b> <b>When</b> the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{students}} in Nashville {{had a chance to}} formalize their plans, events elsewhere brought renewed urgency to the effort. During the first week of February 1960, a small sit-in demonstration in Greensboro, North Carolina, grew into a significant protest with over eighty students participating by the third day. Although similar demonstrations had occurred previously in other cities, this was the first to attract substantial media attention and public <b>notice.</b> <b>When</b> Lawson's group met the subsequent Friday night, about 500 new volunteers showed up to join the cause. Although Lawson and other adult organizers argued for delay, the student leaders insisted that the time had come for action.|$|E
5|$|The Narrator {{complains}} to Tyler about Tyler excluding {{him from}} the newer manifestation of the Fight Club organization Project Mayhem. Soon after, Tyler leaves the house without <b>notice.</b> <b>When</b> a member of Project Mayhem is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the Narrator tries {{to shut down the}} project. Seeking Tyler, he follows evidence of Tyler's national travels. In one city, a Project Mayhem member greets the Narrator as Tyler Durden. The Narrator calls Marla from his hotel room and discovers that Marla also believes him to be Tyler. Tyler suddenly appears in his hotel room, and reveals that they are dissociated personalities in the same body. When the Narrator has believed himself to be asleep, Tyler has been controlling his body and traveling to different locations.|$|E

5|$|There's {{going to}} be no more digital {{enhancements}} or digital additions to anything based on any film I direct.... When people ask me which E.T. they should look at, I always tell them to look at the original 1982 E.T. If you <b>notice,</b> <b>when</b> we did put out E.T. we put out two E.T.s. We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version. I always tell people {{to go back to the}} '82 version.|$|E
5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience in Something for the Boys. He sat ready to work in his dressing room for two weeks without being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five weeks before he was actually called to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work <b>notice.</b> <b>When</b> Como finally appeared, the director had no idea who he was.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, the School's musical protégés came to wider <b>notice</b> <b>when</b> {{featured}} in a TV documentary A Boy Called Alex. The film followed an Etonian, Alex Stobbs, a musician with cystic fibrosis, as he worked toward conducting the difficult Magnificat by Johann Sebastian Bach.|$|E
25|$|There was {{an effort}} to {{establish}} a new industrial union {{to take the place of}} the railroad brotherhoods. The United Brotherhood of Railway Employees (UBRE) was formed, with George Estes as president. Estes came from a faction of the Order of Railroad Telegraphers. The UBRE came to public <b>notice</b> <b>when</b> it conducted a moderately successful strike in Manitoba in 1902.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} {{tenacity}} (policy of sticking to initial belief) — which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads {{to trying to}} ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well <b>notice</b> <b>when</b> another's opinion seems as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, Admonish {{achieved}} wider <b>notice</b> <b>when</b> twins Emil (guitar) and Jonas Karlsson (bass) both {{appeared on}} the MTV Europe show Pimp My Ride International. On that show, in which their car was modified, the twins advertised their band and Admonish's music was played. Horde also played its first live show ever at Nordic Fest in Oslo, Norway in November 2006. Sherlock was disguised with a hood during the show as he performed both drums and vocals.|$|E
25|$|Sir Thomas More {{has been}} acted {{in whole or}} in part several times as a radio play, twice by the BBC Third Programme (1948, 1956), by the Austrian public radio ORF in 1960, and then again by BBC Radio 3 in 1983 with Ian McKellen playing the title role. McKellen also played the role at the Nottingham Playhouse 10 June-4 July 1964, taking over from John Neville on short <b>notice,</b> <b>when</b> the latter had artistic {{differences}} with director Frank Dunlop during rehearsals.|$|E
25|$|Gabreski {{was also}} criticized {{for having a}} poor {{attitude}} towards wingmen. One historian, citing five interviews with pilots and an unpublished manuscript by a sixth, observed that Gabreski flew the fastest aircraft available and failed to <b>notice</b> <b>when</b> his slower wingmen could not keep up. These pilots, reportedly afraid to fly with him, commented {{that he was more}} interested in personal achievement than in his wingmen. He was also criticized for a lack of discipline among his off-duty pilots and for allegedly encouraging exaggerated kill claims.|$|E

25|$|Hsu {{is also an}} {{accomplished}} lyricist. Her lyric-writing talent first gained serious <b>notice</b> <b>when</b> she completed several songs for Taiwan's R singer/songwriter Jay Chou. By proving {{that she is not}} just another pretty idol, but a very capable artist, Hsu surprised both her critics and adorned fans. She continued to collaborate with Jay on his second and third albums after his triumphant self-titled debut, and co-wrote songs for other pop performers, such as Leehom Wang, Vanness Wu, Show Luo and Gigi Leung. Her lyric work is much praised for its clever and straightforward simplicity.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the primary}} role of Metzinger's syntax was {{played by the}} {{relations}} of its intricate parts within the whole, there was another key factor that emerged: the mobile underlying geometric armature organized as a dynamic composition of superimposed planes. Metzinger, Juan Gris {{and to some extent}} Jacques Lipchitz, would develop this concept further during the war; something Gleizes would <b>notice</b> <b>when</b> he returned to Paris from New York, and develop further still in Painting and its Laws (La Peinture et ses lois), written in 1922 and published in 1923. In that text Gleizes would attribute to this underlying armature 'objective notions of translation and rotation', words in which 'movement is implicit'.|$|E
25|$|Samuel came to <b>notice</b> <b>when</b> he twice won {{the prestigious}} {{award from the}} Society of Artists for the best {{historical}} drawing. He had entered the Royal Academy's schools in 1770. Later he was given money for creating an improvement in the techniques for applying mezzotint grounds, although strangely there are no surviving examples of Samuel's art that use this technique. His work consisted of conversation pieces, whole length paintings and portraits. Several of these were chosen and exhibited at the exhibitions at the Royal Academy between 1772 and 1779. In 1779 Samuel {{took a job as}} an assistant secretary at the Royal Academy (which he kept until his death).|$|E
50|$|It was {{at college}} that his acting skills were first <b>noticed</b> <b>when</b> he took top acting honours at the 1959 Hart House Inter-Varsity Drama {{competition}} in Toronto.|$|R

25|$|He {{spent nine}} {{months on the}} islands, much longer than he had intended. As a Chief Qadi, his skills were highly {{desirable}} in the formerly Buddhist nation that had recently converted to Islam. Half-kidnapped into staying, he became chief judge and married into the royal family of Omar I. He became embroiled in local politics and left when his strict judgments in the laissez-faire island kingdom began to chafe with its rulers. In the Rihla he mentions his dismay at the local women going about with no clothing above the waist, and the locals taking no <b>notice</b> <b>when</b> he complained. From the Maldives, he carried on to Sri Lanka and visited Sri Pada and Tenavaram temple.|$|E
25|$|The {{first thing}} many people <b>notice</b> <b>when</b> {{entering}} {{the gates of}} Oakland is the mausoleum of Jasper Newton Smith, on which sits a striking life-size statue of Smith himself. Jasper Smith was a real estate investor who financed two buildings downtown. One, known as The House that Jack Built, was constructed with the stipulation that its cornerstone be left even after the building was torn down. That cornerstone still stands {{at the entrance of}} the Peachtree Center MARTA station on Carnegie Way. Smith was well known for refusing to wear a necktie due to a bad experience as a child. Therefore, one story describing the creation of his statue notes that when the artist sculpted him wearing a cravat, Smith refused to pay until the offending item had been chiseled off.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} time since the 1989–90 NFL playoffs that neither conference {{championship}} game took place in the Eastern or Central time zone. During that season, the Conference Championship Games were changed from the then-traditional starting times of 12:30p.m. and 4:00p.m. to 1:30p.m. and 5:00p.m. EST respectively. This was to accommodate the fact that the Denver Broncos and San Francisco 49ers hosted the 1989–90 AFC and NFC Championship Games in the Mountain Time Zone and Pacific Time Zone, respectively — thus avoiding a locally played game at 9:30a.m. PST/10:30a.m. MST, but also forcing the networks to change or move their prime time lineups in a moment's <b>notice.</b> <b>When</b> the league changed the traditional starting times for the 2002–03 NFL playoffs to 3 p.m. and 6:30p.m. EST, it eliminated the future possibility of having to reschedule.|$|E
