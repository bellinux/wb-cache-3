40|$|The FCC {{ruling on}} Nov 4 th, 2008 on white spaces {{has opened up}} the {{possibility}} of wireless network deployments over white spaces, i. e., vacant UHF TV channels. A key requirement for any white space device (WSD) is that it must ensure that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> transmissions interfere with incumbents, namely TV transmitters and wireless microphones. The FCC ruling proposes two techniques for WSDs to meet these requirements: spectrum sensing {{and the use of}} a geo-location database. A host of prior work has focussed on building better spectrum sensing techniques for WSDs to determine those parts of teh spectrum that are currently occupied by primaries. While potentially feasible, this approach is technically challenging. Hence, in this paper we propose Sense-Less, an alternate design and approach towards building a white spaces network. As suggested by the very name, in SenseLess, WSDs rely less on spectrum sensing to determine white spaces availability. Instead, they primarily rely on a combination of an up-to-date database of incumbents, sophisticated signal propagation modeling, and an efficient content dissemination mechanism to ensure efficient, scalable, and safe white space network operation. We build, deploy, and evaluate this infrastructure service and compare our results to ground truth spectrum measurements. We present the unique system design considerations in the design and implementation of SenseLess that arise due to operating over the white spaces. We also evaluate the efficiency and scalability of SenseLess. ...|$|R

5|$|Elements {{that show}} tripositive ions with {{electronic}} configuration of a noble gas (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a clear trend in their physical properties, such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium, several trends are broken. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite {{far from the}} nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the lanthanide contraction, lutetium, the last in the lanthanide series, has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge, thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult, and thus making the metal harder. However, lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as melting and boiling points.

In addition, two fifths of the AWM's staff positions were vacant as Treloar had chosen to delay filling these vacancies. Jim McGrath, who had been the Memorial's Assistant Director (Administration) since May 1951, became acting director when Treloar was hospitalised and was confirmed in this position on 15May 1952; Bazley had also applied for this job but lost to McGrath despite having Bean's support. Under the direction of Bean, who had been appointed the Chairman of the Memorial's Board in June 1951, McGrath established a committee to develop strategies for both completing and further developing the Memorial. Bean also personally reviewed the Memorial's collection of World War I artefacts during 1952 and 1953, and found that the register of these items was inadequate and {{it was not possible to}} locate many of them. He attributed this to the movement of the collection between Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra and the changes of directorship during periods in which Treloar was absent.|$|E
