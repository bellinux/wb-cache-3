5|$|In 1954, Bethe testified {{on behalf}} of J. Robert Oppenheimer during the Oppenheimer {{security}} hearing. Specifically, Bethe argued that Oppenheimer's stances against developing the hydrogen bomb in the late 1940s had not hindered its actual development, a topic which {{was seen as a}} key motivating factor behind the hearing. Bethe contended that the developments which led to the successful Teller–Ulam design were a matter of serendipity and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> manpower or logical development of previously existing ideas. During the hearing, Bethe and his wife also tried hard to convince Edward Teller against testifying. However, Teller did not agree, and his testimony {{played a major role in}} the revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance. While Bethe and Teller had been on very good terms during the prewar years, the conflict between them during the Manhattan Project, and especially during the Oppenheimer episode, permanently marred their relationship.|$|E

25|$|So it {{was more}} {{efficient}} and more moral to go for selected targets. In any case, {{it was the only}} way we could operate, because we were so small. For us it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> the professional honor of a soldier, it was the question of an idea, an aim that had to be achieved. We were aiming at a political goal. There are many examples of what we did to be found in the Bible – Gideon and Samson, for instance. This had an influence on our thinking. And we also learned from the history of other peoples who fought for their freedom – the Russian and Irish revolutionaries, Giuseppe Garibaldi and Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
25|$|For Michel Christol, {{the term}} Liberum must be {{understood}} in this context and in an abstract sense. This liberty derives from belonging to a city and expresses {{the end of the}} civitas’ dependence, “the elevation of a community of peregrini to the liberty of Roman citizenship”, which also served to placate the fears of the inhabitants of the pagus and to open the door to a later promotion, to the status of a colony. This promotion took place in 261 CE, during the reign of Gallienus, following an appeal from Aulus Vitellius Felix Honoratus in Michel Christol’s version of events. Thereafter, the defence of the libertas publica was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> defending a privilege at risk, but of requesting the “ultimate liberty” (summa libertas) - the promotion to the status of a colony. Michel Christol also points out the abstract character of terms such as libertas or dignitas; despite their abstract use, they are references to concrete and unique events.|$|E
25|$|For him {{science was}} {{the means of}} exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full {{strength}} it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward {{the end of his}} life it brought him confidence. Gauss' God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.|$|E

500|$|Before the Human Rights Act {{was brought}} before parliament, the government's whitepaper {{considered}} {{that it was}} necessary to prevent courts from setting aside legislation on the basis of incompatibility (reflecting a strong need to respect parliamentary sovereignty). However, the effect on parliamentary sovereignty has been criticised despite the safeguards put in place. Section 3 has been defended, however, by reference to the enhanced morality and constitutionalism of the new system, prompted by an [...] "incoming tide" [...] of human rights. Aileen Kavanagh considers the choice of a court in cases <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> parliamentary sovereignty, but a complex question of how far the judiciary can perform a legislative function in that area. She considers the political and legislative pressure on government after section 3 or 4 overwhelming {{to the extent that the}} concept of parliamentary sovereignty should be [...] "eliminated". However, other writers have stressed the important of the formal right to ignore either decision. The result of this debate has been to label section 3 either a [...] "radical tool" [...] to implement human rights, or a [...] "signficiant limitation" [...] of Parliament's will.|$|E

500|$|Halo Wars was {{originally}} not a Halo series title. Ensemble spent 12 to 18 months {{working on the}} control scheme, using the Age of Mythology engine. The development team hacked an Age of Mythology expansion, , and {{used it as a}} prototype for control experiments. Ensemble found that managing Age of Mythologys resources, units, and buildings was too difficult with the console's controller. [...] "The answer [...] is actually hidden in the question," [...] Jason Pace, Microsoft Game Studio's lead producer, told The New Zealand Herald. [...] "It's something we believe has held strategy games back from succeeding on the console: you can't effectively bring a PC-style strategy game to the console because the fundamental game mechanic is tied to the mouse and keyboard input devices. It's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> just changing the control scheme to be gamepad friendly—you need to adapt the underlying strategy mechanic to make sense with the new input device." [...] Senior designer Justin Rouse said that the team kept the controls from the research they had conducted, but scrapped the rest in favor of [...] "build from the floor up what we need: the basics, the core of a strategy game." [...] With the goal of making [...] "the first great strategy game on the console", Ensemble streamlined gameplay mechanics; the game's single resource is produced at each base site, which allows players to quickly cycle through their bases instead of micromanaging multiple resources at many locations.|$|E
500|$|In 1977, British {{psychiatrist}} David Cooper asked Foucault {{the same}} question which Claude Bourdet had formerly asked Viktor Fainberg during a press conference given by Fainberg and Leonid Plyushch: when the USSR has the whole penitentiary and police apparatus, which could take charge of anybody, and which is perfect in itself, why do they use psychiatry? Foucault answered it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> a distortion {{of the use of}} psychiatry but that was its fundamental project. In the discussion Confinement, Psychiatry, Prison, Foucault states the cooperation of psychiatrists with the KGB in the Soviet Union was not abuse of medicine, but an evident case and [...] "condensation" [...] of psychiatry's [...] "inheritance", an [...] "intensification, the ossification of a kinship structure that has never ceased to function." [...] Foucault believed that the abuse of psychiatry in the USSR of the 1960s was a logical extension of the invasion of psychiatry into the legal system. In the discussion with Jean Laplanche and Robert Badinter, Foucault says that criminologists of the 1880—1900s started speaking surprisingly modern language: [...] "The crime cannot be, for the criminal, but an abnormal, disturbed behavior. If he upsets society, it's because he himself is upset". This led to the twofold conclusions. First, [...] "the judicial apparatus is no longer useful." [...] The judges, as men of law, understand such complex, alien legal issues, purely psychological matters no better than the criminal. So commissions of psychiatrists and physicians should be substituted for the judicial apparatus. And in this vein, concrete projects were proposed. Second, [...] "We must certainly treat this individual who is dangerous only because he is sick. But, at the same time, we must protect society against him." [...] Hence comes the idea of mental isolation with a mixed function: therapeutic and prophylactic. In the 1900s, these projects have given rise to very lively responses from European judicial and political bodies. However, they found a wide field of applications when the Soviet Union {{became one of the most}} common but by no means exceptional cases.|$|E
