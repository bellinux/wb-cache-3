He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because <b>ninety-nine</b> <b>percent</b> of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the trial, only ABO blood typing {{evidence}} was presented, which indicated that DuMond, along with 28 percent of the population, could have produced the semen. In 1987 the victim's jeans were given to an expert, Dr. Moses Schanfield. Using protein-based immunoglobulin allotyping, a technique less specific than current standard DNA tests, Schanfield examined a semen spot on the jeans. Dunleavy claimed Schanfield told him, [...] "No way, zip, nada. No way DuMond was the donor of that sperm. Not in a million years." [...] However, the court documents do not accord with that. In DuMond vs. Lockhart, the Court wrote: [...] "Dr. Schanfield had genetic allotyping performed on the semen found on the victim's pant leg. Schanfield concluded that based on the test, there was a <b>ninety-nine</b> plus <b>percent</b> probability that DuMond was not the rapist because the semen lacked a genetic marker which DuMond possessed. However, Dr. Schanfield's conclusion was {{based on the assumption that}} vaginal fluids were not mixed with the semen used for the test.

The lawsuit was eventually dismissed by US District Judge Colleen McMahon. While McMahon noted that the intertitle that appears {{at the end of the}} film, stating that Lucas' collaboration led to the arrest of many corrupt DEA agents, was [...] "wholly inaccurate", in that Lucas' cooperation did not lead to the convictions, and admonished that [...] "It would behoove a major corporation like Universal (which is owned by a major news organization, NBC) not to put inaccurate statements at the end of popular films", she stated that the film failed to meet legal standards of defamation because it failed to [...] "show a single person who is identifiable as a DEA agent".|$|E
