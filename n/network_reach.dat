30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} fast convergent average consensus based on community detection algorithm. Generally, {{we know that}} a small network can have a faster convergence speed than a big one at the same condition. So we divide a multiagent network into several small networks. Firstly, let every small <b>network</b> <b>reach</b> own consensus, and then entire <b>network</b> <b>reach</b> the average consensus. Based on this idea, we present FCWAC Algorithm. For the FCWAC Algorithm, we obtain the results on the average consensus of first-, second-, and high-order continuous-time multiagent systems. Finally, simulation examples illustrate our theoretical results.|$|E

This paper contains the investigation of long-reach high speed 16 -channel DWDM-PON system with efficient CD compensation methods. It is shown that chromatic dispersion compensation has a crucial role for guaranteed downstream optical link performance and maximum link length of high speed long-reach DWDM-PON system. The results show that usage of additional 7 km long dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) placed in central office improves the DWDM-PON <b>network</b> <b>reach</b> by 19. 3 % (from 57 km up to 68 km) but usage of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) improves <b>network</b> <b>reach</b> up to 26. 3 % (from 57 km up to 72 km). As a result, authors recommend the use of FBG for chromatic dispersion compensation to increase the maximum transmission distance of high speed DWDM-PON system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{increased}} <b>network</b> <b>reach</b> {{and customer}} base of next-generation time and wavelength division multiplexed PON (TWDM-PONs) have necessitated rapid fault detection and subsequent restoration {{of services to}} its users. However, direct application of existing solutions for conventional PONs to TWDM-PONs is unsuitable as these schemes rely on the loss of signal (LOS) of upstream transmissions to trigger protection switching. As TWDM-PONs are required to potentially use sleep/doze mode optical network units (ONU), the loss of upstream transmission from a sleeping or dozing ONU could erroneously trigger protection switching. Further, TWDM-PONs require its monitoring modules for fiber/device fault detection {{to be more sensitive}} than those typically deployed in conventional PONs. To address the above issues, three survivable architectures that are compliant with TWDM-PON specifications are presented in this work. These architectures combine rapid detection and protection switching against multipoint failure, and most importantly do not rely on upstream transmissions for LOS activation. Survivability analyses as well as evaluations of the additional costs incurred to achieve survivability are performed and compared to the unprotected TWDM-PON. Network parameters that impact the maximum achievable <b>network</b> <b>reach,</b> maximum split ratio, connection availability, fault impact, and the incremental reliability costs for each proposed survivable architecture are highlighted...|$|E
