2500|$|In Spain, {{legal and}} illegal foreign {{immigrants}} retain use of their cultural naming customs, yet upon becoming Spanish citizens, they are legally obliged to assume Spanish-style names (a name and two surnames). [...] If the <b>naturalised</b> <b>person</b> is from a one-surname culture, the actual surname is duplicated; [...] therefore, the English name [...] "George Albert Duran" [...] becomes the Spanish name [...] "George Albert Duran Duran", yet the law optionally allows him to adopt his mother's maiden name (her surname), as his maternal (second) surname. Formally, Spanish naming customs conflate his name [...] "George" [...] and his middle-name [...] "Albert" [...] to the composite name [...] "George Albert", and his sole surname, [...] "Duran", is duplicated as his paternal and maternal surnames. The repetition of the mother's surname was also adopted in Chile to give the children of single mothers a double surname to avoid discrimination in school.|$|E

2500|$|In 1746 a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Irish House of Commons [...] "for <b>naturalising</b> <b>persons</b> professing the Jewish religion in Ireland". This was the first reference to Jews in the House of Commons up to this time. Another {{was introduced in}} the following year, agreed to without amendment and presented to the Lord Lieutenant to be transmitted to England but it never received the royal assent. These Irish bills, however, had one very important result; namely, the formation of the Committee of Diligence, which was organized by British Jews at this time to watch the progress of the measure. This ultimately led to the organisation of the Board of Deputies, an important body which has continued in existence to the present time. Jews were expressly excepted from the benefit of the Irish Naturalisation Act of 1783. The exceptions in the Naturalisation Act of 1783 were abolished in 1846. The Irish Marriage Act of 1844 expressly made provision for marriages according to Jewish rites.|$|R

50|$|Naturalization {{is not a}} {{right of}} any {{long-term}} resident. It is held {{at the discretion of}} the Government of Bangladesh, and may be conferred categorically or without certain rights or privileges. Any adult of good character residing in Bangladesh for a period of five years (two, if married to a Bangladeshi), having resided in Bangladesh continuously for 12 months, competent in Bengali language and intending to reside in Bangladesh can apply for naturalisation. If <b>naturalised,</b> the <b>person</b> must forfeit any other nationalities held.

5000|$|Women {{lost their}} {{original}} Italian citizenship if they married a foreign husband whose country's laws gave its citizenship to the wife, {{as a direct}} and immediate effect of the marriage. (This is a situation under review, since article 10 of this statute providing for the automatic loss of citizenship by marriage is {{in contrast with the}} second paragraph of article 8, having global scope, which does not approve of the automatic loss of citizenship by foreign naturalisation. The loss of citizenship under article 8 is not considered automatic because the voluntary acceptance of a new citizenship must have been manifested by the <b>person</b> <b>naturalising</b> for Italian citizenship to be lost pursuant to article 8).|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} the causal theory of action cannot explain {{conscious}} human action adequately. Interpreting actions as bodily movements caused by (mental) states internal to the agent does not {{do justice to the}} particular role of the agent herself as ‘performing’ or ‘bringing about’ the action in the light of specific reasons. The only thing one can say about actions being distinct from other bodily movements such as automatic physiological processes or reflexes will employ again the concept of action resp. of the agent doing something consciously. Therefore the thesis is defended that the concept of conscious action resp. human agency is a basic concept referring to the basic capacity of human persons to perform actions consciously. This capacity cannot be reduced to other phenomena within the agent such as mental states and causal mechanisms regulating and guiding human behaviour. If this view of human agency is correct, it sets a limit to attempts of <b>naturalising</b> the human <b>person...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{cannot be}} denied {{that there are}} many various debates on the {{existence}} of the Gun System from the viewpoint of the consititutional history in this country, merely because the Gun is a unit of sub-division in the institutions, upon which the purpose of this treatise has been put. 　Originally {{it is obvious that the}} “has been derived from the “Kohri” used in the districts of <b>persons</b> <b>naturalised</b> in Japan, the name of which has some relations with the custom of their former nationality. 　Therefore, we must take it into consideration to evaluate the historical characteristics of the names in the district of the “Kohri ” before the system and the historical meaning of the Kohri can be investigated. 　Judging from this viewpoint, the position of the Kohri was in its history very remarkable in the Prefecture System of the anterior period of Taika Age. It means that the Kohri had a close relation with political institutions of the period and the origanisation of the prefectural Institution made the social system of Clan the essence of the bureaucratic administration, while the administrative division of the Kohri was considered a regional and social institution, with the result that the Kohri might be said to have appeared the term of the administrative region since the historical transition of the Social Institution, from the end of the fourth century to thr middle of the sixth century. In this period the leading influence was transferred form the Union of Yamato States to the Keitai and Kimmei Dynasties, when Clan Soga performed the important part in politics backed up by the naturalised Clans of Hata, Aya etc. economically and sociall as well as politically. 　And more, it was remarkable, too, that in this political institution the bureacratic and ruling systlm had its greater influence upon various political forms than other institutions in Kinki District. 　Kinki District was the base of Naturalised Clans and formerly formed the groupresidence, but with the political promotion of the Clan Soga their standarns for living were elevated. 　It was on account of this institution that the Kohri had come to comparehend the political meaning for a sub-division of regional society in Japan, and in addition, the reason for its historical existence in Kinki District might be explained...|$|R
