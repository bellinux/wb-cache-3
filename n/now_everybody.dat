5|$|Job Maarse, artistic {{director}} of Pentatone, said of the album's origins: From day one the co-operation between Pentatone and the Oregon Symphony and its Music Director Carlos Kalmar has been something magical. The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar {{attracted the attention of}} a large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea for this new album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and <b>now</b> <b>everybody</b> can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit perfectly in one program. And of course the Copland symphony {{is one of the best}} pieces ever written by an American composer.|$|E
500|$|Ne-Yo's third album, Year of the Gentleman, was {{released}} internationally on August 5, 2008. Speaking to noted UK R writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Ne-Yo explained the thinking behind its title: [...] "To me Year of the Gentleman {{is all about}} a persona, a swag and a charm. I made {{an assessment of the}} music business. And, in my personal opinion, the essence of the gentleman is absent right <b>now.</b> <b>Everybody</b> kinda looks the same, everybody's kinda doing the same thing, everybody's kinda rude and full of themselves. Whereas a gentleman is calm, courteous, kind, charming... So that title basically represents me trying to lead by example, and showing these cats {{what it is to be}} a gentleman in this business still." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} scheduled for release, August 18, 2009, but plans were changed for unknown reasons. Legacy received main production credits on the album. In {{an interview with}} Format Magazine he said, [...] "I started making beats because I didn’t want everybody else’s sound. We wanted our own sound. So, I {{had no choice but}} to make my own beats to get that sound." [...] In an interview with Ozone Magazine, when asked about their music and the revival of the [...] "newer west" [...] movement, Ben J stated, [...] "Everything is becoming positive out here.

500|$|Gene Hoglan, later {{known as}} the drummer for bands like Dark Angel and Death, {{provided}} backing vocals on the song [...] "Evil Has No Boundaries". [...] "Back {{at the time it}} was Jeff [...] and Kerry doing the 'Evil!' You know, it didn't sound too heavy and I mentioned to like Tom or Jeff or somebody like, 'You know you guys should consider...maybe consider doing like big gang vocals on that, make it sound evil like demons and stuff,' and they were like 'Good idea.' But how about now, we got about eight dudes sitting around in the studio, and <b>now</b> <b>everybody</b> jumped up and yelled 'EVIL!!!' So I was like 'Cool' because I'm like, 'I wanna sing on this record somehow, that's how I can do it,' totally unplanned you know?! Sure enough they were like, 'Fuck we have the time, let's do it.' So I was like 'Yeah, I got to sing on it!'" [...] On recording the drums, Slagel wanted drummer Dave Lombardo to play without using cymbals due to the amount of noise they made, as he was unsure if he could siphon the noise out, which he eventually did.|$|E

2500|$|... 1888: Bertha Benz and her {{two sons}} arrived in Pforzheim on the first [...] "long-distance" [...] drive {{in the history of}} the {{automobile}} in a car manufactured by her husband Carl Benz in order to visit relatives. She had started her drive in Mannheim, which is located about [...] from Pforzheim. The very first gasoline-powered automobile with an internal combustion engine of the inventor had hit the roads only two years earlier after a patent for this new technology had been granted to Karl Benz on 29 January 1886. She bought the gasoline necessary for her trip back home in a [...] "pharmacy" [...] in Pforzheim. During the trip, Bertha Benz had to make repairs with a hairpin to open a blocked fuel line, and after returning home, suggested to her husband that another gear be provided in his automobile for climbing hills. To commemorate this first long-distance journey by automobile, the Bertha Benz Memorial Route was officially approved as a route of industrial heritage of mankind in 2008. <b>Now</b> <b>everybody</b> can follow the [...] of signposted route from Mannheim via Heidelberg to Pforzheim and back.|$|E

[...] Andrew Rosenblum from the New York Observer says [...] "Animal Spirits is most compelling when the authors summon all the key behavioral patterns to explain vast, complex phenomena such as the Great Depression.... Animal Spirits...is aimed squarely at the general reader, and rightly so: Macroeconomics is <b>now</b> <b>everybody's</b> business—the banks are playing with our money." ...|$|R
2500|$|OB4CL popularized street-related, Mafioso rap on {{the east}} coast. While this style was {{originated}} by Kool G Rap in the late 1980s, it didn't completely permeate the hip hop world until the release of OB4CL in 1995. References to Cuban Linx could be heard heavily in following years with several notable changes in hip hop culture. For instance, the album refers to [...] "Wu-Gambinos" [...] in various occurrences; the term being {{a name for the}} 'alter-egos' of the rappers involved in Cuban Linx, and used on various later projects. These alter-egos inspired an already dissociative hip-hop world to adopt new names and personae, from Nas' Escobar moniker to Notorious B.I.G.'s Frank White counterpart, which he would go on to further utilize upon the release of OB4CL. A known fan of the Wu, Tupac Shakur began to refer to himself as Makaveli and gave his Outlawz crew new names, albeit with a militaristic, dictatorial theme. In regard to Raekwon's innovation of the gambinos, Method Man later affirmed [...] "Raekwon started that. Rae always had that mobster mentality, always liked to watch gangster movies and read mob books and stuff like that, you know? So he pretty much knew the names of the cats and what they was about. He polished his whole style like that." [...] Ghostface Killah also touched base on the gambino influence stating [...] "We done took that to the highest peak. We bonded as a tight family, so niggas is starting to try and do that right <b>now.</b> <b>Everybody</b> thinking they have a strong family. We opened up the door for a lot of niggas. The shit was just crazy on how it came together." ...|$|E

If you've got a plumbing business, you're gonna be better off ... if you've got a whole bunch of customers who can afford to hire you, and right <b>now</b> <b>everybody's</b> so pinched that business is bad for everybody and I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody." ...|$|R
