5|$|Musically speaking, Hate {{is notable}} for its stripped-down, {{straightforward}} approach {{and the use}} of a drum machine, the latter sparking some controversy. Lamounier claimed to have <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> using this device, on the basis that most death metal drummers use trigger pads for recording purposes, which in the end produces the same homogenized sound as that of a drum machine.|$|E

This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class differences are more marked than in the USA. The film pits passion and the dream of happiness against ambition and arrivisme, resolving the dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice.|$|E

Most of Bunker's {{characters}} have <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> stealing or brutalizing others and, as a rule, they prefer {{a life of crime}} over an honest job, in great part because the only honest career options are badly paying and low-class jobs in retail or manual labor.|$|E

Cobra Commander had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> torturing his own son to unearth the conspiracy, yet Billy refused to surrender who had sponsored the hit. Storm Shadow later freed Billy, and they both escaped to New York, where Storm Shadow trained him in ninjitsu.

25|$|Ben appears {{far less}} {{competent}} when he agrees to {{a green card}} marriage with his British co-worker Sara. He had just given up on his search for the perfect girl, {{who happens to be}} independently wealthy, enjoys mixed martial arts, and reads Sue Grafton novels. Once married, Ben immediately meets Cassidy while chasing a soul, and she fits every criteria for his perfect girl. Sara, far crueler and more shrewd than she initially lets on, forbids Ben to see Cassidy, though she has <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> her own extramarital affairs that she keeps secret from Ben. Ben is eventually able to negotiate a compromise with Sara after discovering she is pregnant with her married boyfriend Esteban's child.|$|E
25|$|The Saint {{starring}} Val Kilmer {{was made}} in 1997 but diverged far from the Charteris books, although it did revive Templar's use of aliases. Kilmer's Saint is unable to defeat a Russian gangster in hand-to-hand combat and is forced to flee; {{this would have been}} unthinkable in a Charteris tale. Whereas the original Saint resorted to aliases that had the initials S.T., Kilmer's character used Christian saints, regardless of initials. This Saint refrained from killing, and even the main villains live to stand trial, whereas Charteris's version had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> taking another life. Kilmer's Saint is presented as a master of disguise, but Charteris's version hardly used the sophisticated ones shown in this film. The film mirrored aspects of Charteris's own life, notably his origins in the Far East, though not in an orphanage as the film portrayed. Sir Roger Moore features throughout in cameo as the BBC Newsreader heard in Simon Templar's Volvo.|$|E

Nevertheless, Dow did not consider himself [...] "a party man in the politician's understanding of the term," [...] and had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> encouraging his supporters to vote against any Whig whom he considered insufficiently anti-alcohol.|$|E

Roger Ebert posed the film's underlying question as [...] "To what degree are we prepared to set aside our moral qualms in order to indulge in greed and selfishness?

Brother Eye, now spliced between a NORAD hard drive containing the bulk of his core programming and a backup satellite orbiting the Earth, activated Michael, incidentally saving him from a round-up. The Michael-OMAC reveals himself to be problematic from the first moments of being online. While other OMACs had <b>no</b> personality, nor <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> being used as killing machines, the Michael-OMAC actually rebelled against his programming upon being ordered to kill a female policewoman, Vienna Barstow, who was an associate and love interest of Michael.

She went on to make an almost complete recovery, but continued to walk with a limp. VuloviÄ‡ maintained that she had no memory of the incident and thus had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> flying {{in the aftermath of the}} crash. Despite her willingness to resume working as a flight attendant, JAT decided to give her a desk job negotiating freight contracts.

500|$|Flann's reign {{began with}} a demand for hostages from the kings of Leinster. In 881, he led an army of Irishmen and [...] "Foreigners" [...] into the north, attacking Armagh. Unlike the later poetic {{accounts}} which made the Gaels and the [...] "Foreigners" [...] bitterest enemies, and recast events as a struggle between natives and incomers, Irish kings generally had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> allying themselves with the [...] "Foreigners" [...] when convenient. It is likely that one of Flann's sisters {{was married to a}} Norse or Norse-Gael leader. Gerald of Wales offers a typically inventive account of how this marriage came about in his Topographia Hibernica. Gerald claimed that MÃ¡el Sechnaill had granted his daughter to the Viking chieftain called Turgesius, and he had sent fifteen beardless young men, disguised as the bride's handmaidens, to kill the chieftain and his closest associates.|$|E
500|$|In several {{instances}} in Torchwood, Jack displays <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> killing {{a person of}} any species, which within Doctor Who, allows Jack's character to act in ways the lead character cannot.

[...] A flashback in the third series of Torchwood shows Captain Jack sacrificing twelve children to aliens {{in order to save}} millions of lives. Davies feels that the third series of Torchwood is a [...] "tale of retribution and perhaps redemption" [...] for Captain Jack, who experiences [...] "maximum damage" [...] when his lover Ianto is killed. Davies chose to have Ianto die so that Jack would be damaged enough to sacrifice his grandson in order to destroy the same aliens.|$|E
40|$|Parental {{satisfaction}} {{is critical to}} the politics of school reform. Many charter school advocates have <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> in talking <b>about</b> a charter school move-ment, linking charter schools to a larger political effort to reform the system of education in the United States. If this movement is to have traction, par-ents who are satisfied with their childrenâ€™s schools represent a potential pool of supporters for further expansion of charter schools and choice in general. In contrast, if charter school parents are not satisfied with their schools, then a foundation for the movement is missing. In this article, using data from a four-wave panel study of parents in Washington, DC, with children in the traditional public schools and in the growing charter school sector, we ex-plore the effect of charter school enrollment on satisfaction...|$|R

His intelligent and his prodigious memory lead him to great success, both in the artistic circles of Paris and in diplomatic missions in foreign parts. But slowly, he becomes enamoured with the arrognt daughter of the marquess, Mathilde de la Mole, who is also infatuated with Julien. For the latter, Mathilde is desirable since others desire her. Her social rank pushes him to accept their affair. But Mathilde falls pregnant, and to avoid any dishonour, the marquess gives Julien a great sum of money, ennobles him as Julien Sorel de la Vernaye and makes him a lieutenant of the Hussards. But Julien abandons his new life when he attempts to murder Mme de RÃªnal in the church at VerriÃ¨res, since she exposed Julien's immorality to the marquess as her confessor advised her to.|$|R
5000|$|Despite having {{significant}} {{roles in}} many films, Corri {{is best known}} for one of her smaller parts, that of Mrs. Alexander, the wife of the writer Frank Alexander, in Stanley Kubrick's dystopian film A Clockwork Orange (1971). Though not originally cast in this role, she was brought in after the previous actress, reported to be Bernadette Milnes, left the film. Corri was offered the role after two actresses had already withdrawn from the film, one of them, according to Malcolm McDowell (Alex in the film), because she found it [...] "too humiliating -- because it involved having to be perched, naked, on Warren Clarke's (playing Dim the Droog) shoulders for weeks on end while Stanley decided which shot he liked the best." [...] Corri had <b>no</b> such <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> appearing naked, joking to McDowell: [...] "Well, Malcolm, youâ€™re about to find out that Iâ€™m a real redhead." [...] Corri earned Kubrick's respect by her willingness to undergo the grueling process of shooting endless takes. She recalled: [...] "For four days I was bashed about by Malcolm (Alex) and he really hit me. One scene was shot 39 times until Malcolm said 'I can't hit her anymore!'" ...|$|R
500|$|For the HBO {{television}} film Wit (2001), however, Thompson happily {{took the lead}} role in what she felt was [...] "one of the best scripts to {{have come out of}} America". Adapted from Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning play, it focusses on a self-sufficient Harvard University professor who finds her values challenged when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Thompson was instrumental in bringing Mike Nichols to direct the project, and the pair spent months in rehearsal to get the complex character right. [...] She was greatly drawn to the [...] "daredevil" [...] role, for which she had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> shaving her head. Reviewing the performance, Roger Ebert was touched by [...] "the way she struggles with every ounce of her humanity to keep her self-respect", and in 2008 he called it Thompson's finest work. Caryn James of The New York Times also described it as [...] "one of her most brilliant performances", adding [...] "we seem to be peering into a soul as embattled as its body." [...] The film earned Thompson nominations at the Golden Globes, Emmys and Screen Actors Guild Awards.|$|E
500|$|In a [...] "reversed opening", White {{plays an}} opening {{typically}} played by Black, but with colors reversed and thus an extra tempo. Evans writes of such openings, [...] "If a defense is considered good for Black, {{it must be}} even better for White with a move in hand." [...] Former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik reportedly expressed the same view. Watson questions this idea, citing Suba's thesis that Black, by moving second, has more complete information than White. He writes, [...] "everyone has such difficulties playing as White against a Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5), but ... leading masters have <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> answering 1.c4 with 1...e5." [...] To explain this paradox, Watson discusses several different reversed Sicilian lines, showing how Black can exploit the disadvantages of various [...] "extra" [...] moves for White. He concludes, [...] "The point is, Black's set-up in the Sicilian is fine as a reactive system, but not worth much when trying to claim the initiative as White. This is true because Black is able {{to react to the}} specific plan White chooses; in Suba's terms, his information is indeed a move greater! Furthermore, he is {{able to take advantage of}} dead equal positions which White (hoping to retain the advantage of the first move) would normally avoid." ...|$|E

At the time he was a thirty-one-year-old barrister with a strong practice, and her father had <b>no</b> <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> accepting his offer. Six months after they married John Paston died, leaving his daughter and son-in-law his entire estate and several of his clients. Bridget maintained a diary, which reveals that she mainly ran the household. Despite this she was an independent woman, travelling without her husband and acting as a helpmate to Coke. Bridget was noted by Woolrych as an [...] "incomparable" [...] woman who had [...] "inestimable value clearly manifested by the eulogies which are lavished on her character". The couple settled at the manor of Huntingfield, described by Catherine Drinker Bowen as [...] "enchanting, with a legend for every turret...
