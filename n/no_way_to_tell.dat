Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests.

2500|$|Qizhou {{was a major}} {{fortress}} city situated {{near the}} Yangtze and a 25 thousand strong Jin army advanced on it in 1221. News of the approaching army reached Zhao Yurong in Qizhou, and despite being outnumbered nearly eight to one, he decided to hold the city. Qizhou's arsenal consisted of some three thousand thunderclap bombs, twenty thousand [...] "great leather bombs" [...] (皮大炮), and thousands of gunpowder arrows and gunpowder crossbow bolts. While the formula for gunpowder had become potent enough to consider the Song bombs to be true explosives, {{they were unable to}} match the explosive power of the Jin iron bombs. Yurong describes the uneven exchange thus, [...] "The barbaric enemy attacked the Northwest Tower with an unceasing flow of catapult projectiles from thirteen catapults. Each catapult shot was followed by an iron fire bomb , whose sound was like thunder. That day, the city soldiers in facing the catapult shots showed great courage as they maneuvered [...] catapults, hindered by injuries from the iron fire bombs. Their heads, their eyes, their cheeks were exploded to bits, and only one half [...] was left." [...] Jin artillerists were able to successfully target the command center itself: [...] "The enemy fired off catapult stones ... nonstop day and night, and the magistrate's headquarters [...] at the eastern gate, as well as my own quarters ..., were hit by the most iron fire bombs, {{to the point that they}} struck even on top of [...] sleeping quarters and [...] nearly perished! Some said there was a traitor. If not, how would they have known the way to strike at both of these places?" [...] Zhao was able to examine the new iron bombs himself and described thus, [...] "In shape they are like gourds, but with a small mouth. They are made with pig iron, about two inches thick, and they cause the city's walls to shake." [...] Houses were blown apart, towers battered, and defenders blasted from their placements. Within four weeks all four gates were under heavy bombardment. Finally the Jin made a frontal assault on the walls and scaled them, after which followed a merciless hunt for soldiers, officers, and officials of every level. Zhao managed an escape by clambering over the battlement and making a hasty retreat across the river, but his family remained in the city. Upon returning at a later date to search the ruins, he found that the [...] "bones and skeletons were so mixed up that there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> who was who." ...|$|E

He had <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if internal hemorrhage still went on, but he believed that it had stopped. Otherwise she would surely not have lived so long. He marked the entrance of the bullet, and concluded that it had just touched the upper lobe of her lung. Perhaps the wound in the lung had also closed.

It was indeed remarkable how silently they could stalk a man. They could creep through a thicket so dense you would not believe a rabbit could get through, and do it without the slightest sound. Then, when ready to charge, they did so with terrible onslaught and roar. They leaped right into a circle of fires, tore down huts, even dragged natives from the low trees.
