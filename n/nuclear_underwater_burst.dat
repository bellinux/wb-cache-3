5000|$|For {{subsurface}} bursts, {{there is}} an additional phenomenon present called [...] "base surge". The base surge is a cloud that rolls outward {{from the bottom of}} the subsiding column, which is caused by an excessive density of dust or water droplets in the air. For <b>underwater</b> <b>bursts,</b> the visible surge is, in effect, a cloud of liquid (usually water) droplets with the property of flowing almost as if it were a homogeneous fluid. After the water evaporates, an invisible base surge of small radioactive particles may persist.|$|R

50|$|<b>Underwater</b> <b>nuclear</b> tests {{close to}} the surface can {{disperse}} radioactive water and steam over a large area, with severe effects on marine life, nearby infrastructures and humans.

50|$|Hot particles, {{radioactive}} {{particles of}} nuclear fallout and radioactive waste, also exhibit distinct isotopic signatures. Their radionuclide composition (and thus their age and origin) {{can be determined}} by mass spectrometry or by gamma spectrometry. For example, particles generated by a nuclear blast contain detectable amounts of 60Co and 152Eu. The Chernobyl accident did not release these particles but did release 125Sb and 144Ce. Particles from <b>underwater</b> <b>bursts</b> will consist mostly of irradiated sea salts. Ratios of 152Eu/155Eu, 154Eu/155Eu, and 238Pu/239Pu are also different for fusion and fission nuclear weapons, which allows identification of hot particles of unknown origin.|$|R

While [...] picked up survivors from the sunken destroyer escort, Whitehurst, detached from TU 77.7.1 to conduct a search, soon picked up a contact. At general quarters, the destroyer escort conducted three attacks without conclusive results. When Whitehurst pressed home a fourth depth charge attack, her efforts were crowned with success. In quick succession, five to seven explosions rumbled up from the depths. Another violent <b>underwater</b> <b>burst</b> soon followed, causing a concussion that damaged Whitehurst&#39;s detecting gear.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis {{research was conducted}} to enhance understanding {{of the use of}} high explosives to simulate the effects of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>underwater</b> explosion. A review of the known characteristics of the nuclear, spherical conventional, and tapered conventional underwater pressure-time histories illustrates the selection of the tapered charge to simulate the <b>underwater</b> <b>nuclear</b> explosion. Three areas of study were then pursued. The first compared the structural response resulting from attack by conventional and nuclear type pressure profiles, verifying the need to match duration as well as peak pressure when simulation the <b>underwater</b> <b>nuclear</b> explosion. The second employed finite element analysis to study the three dimensional shock generated by a tapered charge. Third, a computer program was written to couple an optimizer with an existing tapered charge pressure profile generating code to improve the tapered charge design process.

5000|$|Following {{extensive}} conversion, YAG-39 {{was placed}} in service at San Francisco, California, on 20 October 1953, with Lt. Comdr. Hugh W. Anglin in command. Assigned to Joint Task Force 7, she steamed to Eniwetok, Marshall Islands, where from March through May 1954 she participated in atomic tests at the Pacific Proving Grounds. During [...] "Operation Castle", a <b>nuclear</b> <b>underwater</b> test, she gathered fallout data and carried out experimental ship protection studies. After returning to San Francisco, California, she was placed out of service from June until February 1955. In May, YAG-39 again served with Joint Task Force 7 during [...] "Operation Wigwam", the deep <b>underwater</b> <b>nuclear</b> test {{carried out in the}} Eastern Pacific. During the next 10 months she operated between the West Coast and Hawaii, and conducted various experimental tests before returning to Eniwetok on 8 April 1956 to participate in additional nuclear tests. From 21 May to 23 July she took part in four nuclear-proving tests and gathered scientific data to advance knowledge of the atom and the effects of nuclear fission. Departing Eniwetok on 28 July, YAG-39 steamed via Pearl Harbor to San Francisco, California, where she arrived on 16 August. After receiving additional scientific equipment, she departed San Francisco on 6 February 1957 to resume experimental operations off the California coast. During the next few months she steamed with [...] while testing advanced weapons and ship protection systems. Towed to San Diego, California, 21 October for inactivation, she was placed out of service on 1 November and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego.|$|R

40|$|The Nonlinear Progressive Wave Equation (NPE) [McDonald and Kuperman, 1987] {{computer}} code was {{coupled with a}} linear normal mode code in order to study propagation from a high intensity source in either shallow or deep water. Simulations using the coupled NPE/linear code are used to study both harmonic (high frequency) and parametric (low frequency) generation and propagation in shallow or deep water with long-range propagation paths. Included in the modeling are both shock dissipation and linear attenuation. The results of these studies are presented. OBJECTIVE Linear acoustic propagation in a waveguide has been studied extensively theoretically, numerically and experimentally. In case of a large underwater explosion, nonlinear processes affect {{the properties of the}} acoustic wave. One can expect to characterize and localize <b>nuclear</b> <b>underwater</b> explosions by examining spectrograms, which would show this specific nonlinear behavior [Kuperman et al, 2001; D’Spain et al 2000; Gerstoft, 1999]. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight the nonlinear phenomena of acoustical propagation such as the nonlinear steepening and shock dissipation. The nonlinear scar in a pulse propagated over long ranges is discussed. Work on this topic has also been carried out by B. Ed McDonald [2002]...|$|R

Continued atmospheric nuclear weapons testing since 1963 by non-treaty nations included those by China (atomic bomb test above the Gobi Desert in 1964, hydrogen bomb test in 1967, and follow-on tests), and France (tests as recently as the 1990s). Because it is deliberately manufactured for nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors, plutonium-239 is the most abundant isotope of plutonium by far.|$|R
