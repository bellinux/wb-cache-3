One method {{to examine the effects of}} solvent exposure on visual function is flash-evoked potentials (FEPs). Greater knowledge of the role of various neurotransmitters in generating FEP peaks would be ben-eficial for understanding the basis of neurotoxicant-induced changes. FEP peak N 166 is influenced by the psychological con-struct of arousal, which in turn is believed to be influenced by the function of <b>neurons</b> <b>containing</b> <b>norepinephrine</b> (NE). Because of its known effects on both NE and FEPs, we utilized carbon disulfide (CS 2) as a means to examine the possible role of NE in modulating the amplitude of FEP peaks N 36 and N 166.

50|$|The {{endogenous}} receptor {{for substance}} P is neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1-receptor, NK1R). It {{belongs to the}} tachykinin receptor sub-family of GPCRs. Other neurokinin subtypes and neurokinin receptors that interact with SP have been reported as well. Amino acid residues {{that are responsible for}} the binding of SP and its antagonists are present in the extracellular loops and transmembrane regions of NK-1. Binding of SP to NK-1 results in internalization by the clathrin-dependent mechanism to the acidified endosomes where the complex disassociates. Subsequently, SP is degraded and NK-1 is re-expressed on the cell surface. Substance P and the NK1 receptor are widely distributed in the brain and are found in brain regions that are specific to regulating emotion (hypothalamus, amygdala, and the periaqueductal gray). They are found in close association with serotonin (5-HT) and <b>neurons</b> <b>containing</b> <b>norepinephrine</b> that are targeted by the currently used antidepressant drugs. The SP receptor promoter contains regions that are sensitive to cAMP, AP-1, AP-4, CEBPB, and epidermal growth factor. Because these regions are related to complexed signal transduction pathways mediated by cytokines, it has been proposed that cytokines and neurotropic factors can induce NK-1. Also, SP can induce the cytokines that are capable of inducing NK-1 transcription factors.|$|R
40|$|The growth cones of dissociated rat {{sympathetic}} neurons {{developing in}} culture were fixed with potassium permanganate to visualize vesicular stores of norepinephrine through {{the formation of}} granular precipitates. It was found that growth cones contain numerous small granular vesicles (SGV) 40 - 60 nm in diameter. The majority of the SGV was present in the varicosity of the growth cone but SGV also occurred in filopodia. The SGV appeared in clusters or scattered throughout the varicosity. Treatment of the cultured neurons, before fixation, with reserpine, which depletes catecholamine stores by blocking uptake into vesicles, resulted {{in the presence of}} small clear vesicles. In contrast, growth cones of nonadrenergic sensory neurons dissociated from dorsal root ganglia and fixed with permanganate lacked SGV and possessed small clear vesicles.

40|$|Tyrosine hydroxylase [TyrOHase, {{tyrosine}} 3 -monooxygenase, L-tyrosine, tetrahydropteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase (2 -hydroxylating), EC 1. 14. 16. 2] is the {{rate-limiting enzyme}} in the synthetic pathway of catecholamines and is expressed by <b>neurons</b> <b>containing</b> dopamine, <b>norepinephrine,</b> and epinephrine.

The findings suggest that this distribution is distinctly inhomogeneous. The macroscopic compartments known as striosomes have low TyrOHase-like immunoreactivity relative to the surrounding extrastriosomal matrix. These observations add to evidence that dopaminergic modulation of neural processing in the mature striatum is organized in accordance with striosomal architecture and suggest that part of the mechanism for such differentiation may involve presynaptic differences in enzymatic regulation of dopamine content in and out of striosomes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{relationship}} between catecholaminergic nerve fibers and _-adrenergic receptors {{in the heart}} and in the coronary vessels was studied in humans. Only living tissues, harvested from brain-dead heart donors, were used in this experiment. Morphological observations and histochemical staining for norepinephrine and other catecholamines were carried out and _-adrenergic receptors were stained {{by means of a}} _-blocking fluorescent drug. All morphological data underwent quantitative analysis of images and statistical evaluation. This study provided direct evidence for the distribution of catecholaminergic nerve fibers and of _-adrenergic receptors in the myocardium and in the coronary arteries. Catecholaminergic nerve fibers are located in the periadventitial tissue, in the adventitia and in the transitional zone between the intima and media. The _- adrenergic receptors are mainly located in the more innervated part of the heart and coronary arteries but there is a major, although incomplete, overlap with related catecholaminergic nerve fibers. Moreover, using specific substrates and/or inhibitors, two types of _-adrenergic receptors, _ 1 and _ 2, were demonstrated. Owing to the scarcity of available material (we used only four hearts), and objective difficulties in enrolling other patients, we are at this moment unable to draw general conclusions. Key words Catecholaminergic nerve fiber • _-Adrenergic receptor • Coronary artery • Histochemistry • Human heart • Innervation Introduction Innervation of the heart and/or coronary vessels arises from extrinsic sources. 1 Both human myocardium and coronary vessels are under sympathetic 2 and parasympathetic nervous control. 3 The sympathetic nerve fibers can be stained not only by showing the specific marker tyrosine hydroxylase, 4 but also using formaldehyde vapor, 5 and/or glyoxylic acid. 6 Also, intrinsic innervation was recently found, by means of neurons surrounding the great vessels, in guinea pig heart. 7 Concerning the human heart, Singh et al. 8 revealed perivascular, intrinsic ganglia with <b>neurons</b> <b>containing</b> <b>norepinephrine,</b> dopamine, serotonin, and histamine. Therefore, the human heart and coronary vessels may also contain the receptors of such neurotransmitters, including _-adrenergic receptors. Currently, low resolution and technical difficulties as well as high costs characterize receptor imaging techniques. Furthermore, autopsy samples of heart and coronary vessels can be damaged by postmortem changes, while biopsies obtained during conventional open-heart surgery are often not suitable for the complex methods of receptor staining. However, native hearts harvested for orthotopic cardiac transplantation (OHTx), but discarded for technical reasons, can provide a good source of fresh myocardium and/or coronary vessels for receptor-binding techniques. ...|$|R

We have explored the validity of this assumption in rat striatum using multiple-labeling methods. Conventional epi-illumination fluorescence microscopy was used to examine tissue triple labeled for SS, NPY and nNOS, or double-labeled for SS and nNOS or for SS and NPY. In tissue double-labeled for SS and nNOs, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images of SS and nNOS labeling were compared to subsequent NADPHd labeling. We found that SS, NPY and nNOS co-occurred extensively, but a moderately abundant population of <b>neurons</b> <b>containing</b> SS and nNOS but not NPY was also observed, as were small populations of SS only and nNOS only neurons.

Five groups of dye-labelled neurons could be identified immunohistochemically, noradrenergic <b>neurons</b> <b>containing</b> neuropeptide Y (NPY) (60 - 70 %), and four types of non-noradrenergic neurons, NPY-only neurons (5 - 10 %), NPY <b>neurons</b> <b>containing</b> vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (3 - 5 %), <b>neurons</b> <b>containing</b> only VIP (15 - 25 %) and <b>neurons</b> <b>containing</b> galanin (GAL) (2 - 5 %).

In a rat study, long-term treatment with SSRIs led to a significant reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase, an important enzyme in the biosynthesis of dopamine, in the substantia nigra and striatum [16]. Furthermore, dopaminergic <b>neurons</b> <b>contain</b> serotonin receptors, and serotonergic <b>neurons</b> <b>contain</b> dopamine receptors [16]. In an animal model for myoclonus dystonia, an inherited form of dystonia caused by a mutation in the epsilon-sarcoglycan gene (SCGE); the hypothesis of a dysbalanced dopamine-serotonin system has been confirmed. SCGE knockout mice show all the signs of dystonia, from jerks to depression-like behavior. After sacrificing, neurochemical studies in the striata of these mice showed increased levels of dopamine metabolites that correlated with motor performance (dystonia and jerks), while the level of serotonin metabolites, that was {{not significantly different from}} wild-type mice, inversely correlated with motor performance [17]. Jerks in CD, that resemble myoclonus in myoclonus dystonia, may also be related to alterations of the serotonin system.|$|R
