Babb often booked the movie as a midnight presentation {{twice a week}} in the same town; David F.

He became too drunk to perform, and was unable to travel to the <b>next</b> <b>stop.</b> Nye terminated the partnership and tour in response. The reason for the breakup could not be kept secret, and hotel staff reported to the Louisville Courier-Journal that they saw Riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel. The story made national news and Riley feared his career was ruined.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{with this}} momentum, Hoffman {{appeared}} in five films in 1998. He had supporting {{roles in the}} crime thriller Montana and the romantic comedy <b>Next</b> <b>Stop</b> Wonderland, {{both of which were}} commercial failures, before working with the Coen brothers in their dark comedy The Big Lebowski. Hoffman had long been a fan of the directors, and relished the experience of working with them. Appearing alongside Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, Hoffman played Brandt, the smug personal assistant of the titular character. Although it was only a small role, he claimed it was one for which he was most recognized, in a film that has achieved cult status and a large fan base. Between March and April 1998, Hoffman made 30 appearances on stage at the New York Theatre Workshop in a production of Mark Ravenhill's Shopping and Fucking, portraying an ex-heroin addict.|$|E
5|$|LeDuc's <b>next</b> <b>stop</b> was in Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), {{where he}} resumed teaming with Paul LeDuc. Wrestling {{under the name}} The Canadian Lumberjacks, they were soon pushed to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship in December 1973 by {{defeating}} Dusty Rhodes and Dick Slater. They defended the belts for two months before dropping them to Slater and his new partner Stan Vachon, a kayfabe brother of the Vachons from Montreal. This was the final time the LeDuc's held a title together, as Paul LeDuc sustained a legitimate injury that forced Jos to wrestle without him. Jos LeDuc also wrestled as a singles competitor in Florida. He was booked to win the NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship by defeating Rhodes in late 1973. He dropped the title to Rhodes in January 1974, however. LeDuc and Rhodes were placed in a heated feud at this time, and they frequently faced each other in Death matches.|$|E
5|$|Once {{out of the}} village, NY17A and NY94 {{begin to}} climb again, this time {{offering}} some panoramic views to the north, {{all the way to}} the Shawangunk Ridge and even the Catskill Mountains beyond them in clear enough weather. The road is surprisingly little developed in this area, with only one gas station between Florida and Warwick, its <b>next</b> <b>stop,</b> which likewise presents itself after a descent. Again, NY17A and NY94 serve as the bustling village's main street, longer this time and with many upscale boutiques in evidence. Many historic buildings line the road through Warwick. Near the southern end of the village, the two roads split, with NY94 continuing toward New Jersey while NY17A goes eastward.|$|E

5|$|The journey's beginning, on 9 July 1763, was inauspicious; on {{the first}} day a {{carriage}} wheel broke, requiring a 24-hour pause while repairs were carried out. Leopold turned this delay to advantage by taking Wolfgang to the nearby church at Wasserburg, where according to Leopold the boy played on the organ pedalboard {{as if he had been}} studying it for months. In Munich, on successive evenings, the children played before Elector Maximilian III, earning from these engagements the equivalent of half of Leopold's annual salary of 354 gulden or florins. The <b>next</b> <b>stop</b> was Augsburg, where Leopold's estranged mother refused to attend any of the three concerts given there. The family then moved on to Schwetzingen and the Mannheim court, where the children's performance apparently amazed Elector Palatine Karl Theodor and his Electress.|$|E
5|$|Cochet {{then set}} to compete across Europe. As the reigning champions the French Davis Cup team {{had only one}} {{scheduled}} challenge match during the season and could skip the preliminary rounds. Lacoste and Cochet entered the British Hard Court Championships. Pat Spence eliminated Cochet in the semifinal stage but lost to Lacoste in the final. Cochet and Bennett gained the mixed doubles title. In May he accepted a one-on-one and a doubles challenge with Béla von Kehrling and the Hungarian Davis Cup team in Budapest. In front of a local crowd of 3000, Cochet won in four sets against the home favorite. The doubles match between Von Kehrling – Jenő Péteri and Cochet – Roger Danet was indefinitely suspended due to bad light conditions at 6–2, 7–9, one set each. The <b>next</b> <b>stop</b> was in Vienna where he won the Austrian International Championships. Returning home he secured his French International Championships title by overcoming Lacoste in the final in four sets. The doubles were won by Jean Borotra and Jacques Brugnon {{despite the efforts of}} Cochet and René de Buzelet. Cochet and recurring partner Bennett added the French hard courts mixed title to their set of accolades after defeating Helen Wills, women's world champion, and Frank Hunter, the No. 2 USLTA player in a three-set championship match. On 6 July at the 1928 Wimbledon Championships Lacoste equalized with a victory over Cochet and deprived him of the title. Cochet and Bennett lost in the mixed quarterfinals. Cochet and Brugnon won the doubles again over Gerald Patterson and John Hawkes after their 1926 triumph. At the end of July in the Challenge round of the Davis Cup at Roland Garros the Musketeers, with the absence of Brugnon, defeated the United States to keep the trophy in French possession. Cochet won all three of his rubbers.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical cup-bearers and wine-pourers on automatic-traveling boats: The {{mechanical}} engineer Huang Gun served {{the court of}} Emperor Yang Di (r. 604–617) and wrote the book Shuishi Tujing on his inventions, which his colleague Du Bao enlarged and commented on. He constructed seven small boats, called 'wine boats', that were as large as 3m (10ft) long and 1.8m (6ft) wide which supported a number of mechanical figures of wooden statues called 'hydraulic elegances', each about 0.6m (2ft) tall, some of them animals but most in human form consisting of singing girls, musicians playing actual instruments, dancers and tumblers, oarsmen busy rowing, cup-bearers, and wine-pourers all moving simultaneously as if alive. These boats were set to travel at timed intervals along circuits made of winding stone channels and canals in palace courtyards and gardens (designed by Tang Haogui), where guests would gather for special occasions. The cup-bearer stood at the bow of each ship and beside him the wine-pourer; when the ship made automatically timed periodic stops where guests were seated, the cup-bearer automatically stretched out his arm with a full cup of wine. When the guest was done emptying his cup, he placed the cup back into the figure's hands; the latter then waited as the wine-pourer filled a second cup to be emptied. When this guest had been served, the wine boat automatically moved onwards to the <b>next</b> <b>stop.</b> The British sinologist, scientist, and historian Joseph Needham speculates that the 'wine boats' may have been paddle-wheel-driven. Another paddle wheel ship was commanded by Wang Zhen'e and described in his biographies dated from the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). side from the partial remains of the Shuishi Tujing, an account of these 'wine boats' was also preserved by Huang Gun's contemporary Yan Shigu (581–645).|$|E
