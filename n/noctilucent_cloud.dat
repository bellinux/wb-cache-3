5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a {{possible explanation is that}} the ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of sodium and iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and settle into a layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud,</b> sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent clouds {{may be seen}} by {{observers}} at a latitude of 50° to 65°. They seldom {{occur at}} lower latitudes (although there have been sightings {{as far south as}} Paris, Utah, Italy, Turkey and Spain), and closer to the poles it does not get dark enough for the clouds to become visible. They occur during summer, from mid-May to mid-August in the northern hemisphere and between mid-November and mid-February in the southern hemisphere. They are very faint and tenuous, and may be observed only in twilight around sunrise and sunset when the clouds of the lower atmosphere are in shadow, but the <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> is illuminated by the Sun. They are best seen when the Sun is between 6° and 16° below the horizon. Although noctilucent clouds occur in both hemispheres, they have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but fewer than 100 times in the southern. Southern hemisphere noctilucent clouds are fainter and occur less frequently; additionally the southern hemisphere has a lower population and less land area from which to make observations.|$|E

500|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} {{generally}} colourless or pale blue, although occasionally other colours including {{red and green}} occur.

Those caused by rocket exhausts tend to show colours other than silver or blue, because of iridescence caused by the uniform size of the water droplets produced.|$|E

2500|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} {{the highest in the}} {{atmosphere}} and form {{near the top of the}} mesosphere at about ten times the altitude of tropospheric high clouds. From ground level, they can occasionally be seen illuminated by the sun during deep twilight. Ongoing research indicates that convective lift in the mesosphere is strong enough during the polar summer to cause adiabatic cooling of small amount of water vapour to the point of saturation. This tends to produce the coldest temperatures in the entire atmosphere just below the mesopause. These conditions result in the best environment for the formation of polar mesospheric clouds.

500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the relatively recent appearance of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds,</b> and their gradual increase, {{may be linked to}} climate change. The author of the first cited study, atmospheric scientist Gary Thomas of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, has pointed out that the first sightings coincide with both Krakatoa and the nascent Industrial Revolution, and they have become more widespread and frequent throughout the twentieth century, including an uptick between 1964 and 1986. The connection of global warming to <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> remains controversial, however. Gary Thomas may have penned his paper after Wilfried Schröder, who might hold the distinction of being the first to explain <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> as [...] "indicators" [...] for atmospheric processes (Gerlands Beiträge zur Geophysik, 1971, Meteorologische Rundschau 1968–1970). Most recently in 2012 Lonnie Cumberland's physics PhD work supported viewing <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> as a possible Miner's Canary for climate change as her third conclusion as a sign of increasing the presence of water in the high atmosphere. NASA scientists speculate that methane may be driven higher into the mesophere where <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> form by climate change and through reactions that end up producing water at such altitudes.|$|R

However, Maunder wrote that the phenomenon moved rapidly from horizon to horizon, which would rule out a <b>noctilucent</b> <b>cloud</b> or upper tangent arc. Further, upper tangent arc cannot occur during nighttime when the observation was made. Since he made his observation during highly intense auroral activity, he assumed it was some extraordinary auroral phenomenon, though one he had never observed again before or after.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{considers}} historical {{aspects of}} the earliest known observations of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> (NLCs). The 1884 and 1885 are discussed by considering important historical citations by the pioneers of the earliest known observations of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds.</b> For {{the first time in}} NLC studies, we consider seven major volcanic eruptions: Laki in 1783, Mount St. Helens in 1800, Tambora in 1815, Galunggung in 1822, Cosigüina in 1835, Shiveluch in 1854 and Askja in 1875. These all preceded the catastrophic 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, which despite having a lesser magnitude than Tambora in 1815, had pronounced effects on the atmosphere. These eruptions represent possible triggers for the appearance of NLCs. For the first time, we publish an unknown, in English-speaking literature, historical fact on the first determinations of the altitude of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> made by two Russian astronomers V. K. Tseraskii and A. A. Belopolskii on 26 June 1885, who managed to infer the altitude of the clouds in the range of 73 &ndash; 83 km, that is, for the first time, demonstrating the possible existence of the clouds at great altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere. Moreover, V. K. Tseraskii was the first observer to photograph <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> in 1885 or 1886, which is 1 &ndash; 2 yr before the German astronomer O. Jesse, who owns the first published images of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds.</b> The photographs made by V. K. Tseraskii, unfortunately, did not reach us...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> {{indicate}} a secular {{increase in their}} frequency of occurrence which {{may be associated with}} changes either in the water vapour concentration or in the mean temperature of the mesopause. <b>Noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> are expected to be seen very close to the level where the relative humidity is 100 % and changes in temperature of the mesosphere or in its water vapour content might be expected to alter the height at which the clouds occur. Comparison of our height measurements with those obtained over the past 100 yr shows that the suggested changes since 1885 in temperature (a decrease of approximately 7 °C) and water vapour mixing ratio (an increase of approximately 1. 7 ppmv) have not been sufficient to affect the height of the clouds by an observable amount. Future height measurements of <b>noctilucent</b> <b>clouds</b> may provide a practical indicator of changes taking place in the mesosphere which could be associated with global-scale alterations of the lower atmosphere...|$|R
