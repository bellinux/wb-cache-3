In longer term, the influence of competition between railway and airline become more complex, because of network externalities of LOS improvement on networks. This study makes a retrospective assessment of inter-regional transportation services in ODs with their demand by using the Japanese longitudinal data in 1970, and 1995. The inter-regional <b>net</b> passenger <b>traffic,</b> average speed, fare per distance, and least frequency of the link in line-haul route are compared to find the characteristics of inter-regional LOS. Through the analyses, three kinds of inter-regional transportation markets were identified, and the characteristics of those were summarized.

50|$|For a {{long time}} during the interwar period, the entire radio <b>net</b> <b>traffic</b> of Czechoslovakia was {{considered}} easy to intercept and evaluate. It was observed by fixed listening posts and intercept companies in Silesia and Bavaria and subsequently also by stations in Austria. Towards the end of May 1938, {{one of the key}} radio stations in Prague, attached to the Czechoslovakia War Ministry, suddenly transmitted a brief unusual message, which was believed to be an order for mobilization. This message was immediately followed by changed in the radio traffic characterized by the use of new frequencies and call signs, and by regrouping of radio nets which had been prepared for the event of mobilization. During the next few days, very primitive, simple radio nets appeared along the border and then disappeared again when the tension was relax, whereupon the entire radio net resumed its original characteristics. The Intercept Control Station was able to report that the mobilization order had been revoked.|$|E
50|$|On 15 September 1938, most German nets stopped {{encrypting}} the doubled key with {{a common}} setting (the ground setting). The Poles {{had been able to}} take advantage of all messages in a net using the same machine settings to encrypt the doubled key. Now most nets stopped doing that; instead, the operator would choose his own ground setting and send it in the clear to the recipient. This change frustrated the grill method and the cyclometer card catalog. One net, the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) net, continued to use a common ground setting, and that net was used to reverse engineer new rotors (IV and V) that were introduced. The SD <b>net</b> <b>traffic</b> was doubly encoded, so the ANX method would not work. The grill method would sometimes fail after the Germans increased the number of plugboard connections to ten on 1 January 1939. When the SD net switched to the new message-key protocol on 1 July 1939, the grill method (and the cyclometer method) were no longer useful.|$|E

The studies showed that Comcast prevents distribution of files over peer-to-peer networks by sending a RST packet under the guise of the end user, and denying the connection, which effectively blocks the user from seeding over BitTorrent.

Kevin Kanarski, who works as a Lotus Notes messaging engineer, noticed some strange behavior with Lotus Notes dropping emails when hooked up to a Comcast connection and has managed to verify that Comcast's reset packets are the culprit.

40|$|Clones of HepG 2 {{cells were}} {{selected}} that stably express the cDNA for hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). When cells were cultured {{in the presence}} of labelled extracellular oleate, accumulation of labelled fatty acid as cellular triacylglycerol (TAG) was significantly lower in the transfectants compared with the wild-type cells. There was no change in the net rate of phospholipid (PL) synthesis. Culture of cells containing isotopically prelabelled TAG resulted in a greater net loss of TAG from the transfected cells than from the wild-type cells. The excess loss of labelled TAG was primarily due to an increased TAG fatty acid oxidation. Free fatty acid release into the medium was not increased in the transfectants, nor was the very low rate of lipoprotein lipid secretion. Also, there was no increased <b>net</b> <b>trafficking</b> of fatty acids from TAG into PLs. Changes in the 3 H: 14 C ratio of TAG prelabelled with [3 H]glycerol and [14 C]oleate suggested that none of excess TAG fatty acid released in the transfected cells underwent intracellular re-esterification to TAG prior to oxidation. The results suggest that fatty acids mobilized by HSL are directed immediately into the oxidative pathway and are not available for biosynthetic processes. It appears likely, therefore, that intracellular TAG-derived fatty acids which enter the oxidative pathway exist in a different compartment from those that are directed towards synthesi...|$|R

According to an estimate the WWW presently {{contains more than}} 800 millions pages, encompassing about 6 terabytes of text data on about 3 million servers. As the number of web users is increasing rapidly, {{there is a need}} to build fast and efficient systems for handling users requests on the web. Jakob Nielsen's figures from his keynote talk at the QualityWeek 1999 Conference & Exhibition suggest that the webpage should be received within 7 seconds after the request from the user. The real answer to "too slow " probably is more subjective, but at the same time probably not too terribly different. The WebSite sever is configured properly and effectively when it has "enough capacity to meet the customer demands. " Estimating the actual capacity of a WebSite server requires a variety of different types of analyses. There are many deep, highly technical methods for calculating the capacity of a server to meet imposed load. However, a more practical way is to simply measure the perceived response time accurately, and scale up server capacity to make sure that maximum real-user experiences don't exceed unacceptable delays.
