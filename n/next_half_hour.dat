60|$|Jim {{never asked}} no questions, {{he never said}} a word; but the way {{he worked for the}} <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> showed about how he was scared. By that time {{everything}} we had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a candle outside after that.|$|R
50|$|Kids of Workers (Chinese: 《工人的孩子》) {{was created}} in 2007 in Chengdu, China, where he welded and sealed himself in a cage which was hung on a tree {{clustered}} by flowers.

30|$|The {{mixture of}} {{benzylamine}} (0.268  g, 2.5  mmol), isocyanate (3.5  mmol) and triethylamine (0.695  ml, 5  mmol) in DMF (5  ml) was stirred {{at room temperature}} for 5 – 6  h (TLC Check, 50  % ethyl acetate/hexane). To the above stirring solution, KF (88  mg, 1.5  mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 0.5  h.

The product was isolated by filtration and washed with 10  ml water.|$|R
60|$|The time, now, was twenty-three {{minutes past}} twelve. The <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> at most, would decide the {{question}} of whether he would, or would not, get up from his bed, and leave the room.|$|E
60|$|During the <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> {{hardly a}} word was spoken, so {{occupied}} were all hands with watching the stranger, which approached very slowly, {{and at the}} end of that time she was almost within hailing distance.|$|E

Within {{the space of the}} <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour,</b> Dublin was unsuccessfully attacked by the German submarines at least three times with torpedoes, leading Dumaresq to conclude that the Germans were attempting to spring a trap on the British vessels. He subsequently ordered Obdurate to complete its investigation of the suspect vessel, which was subsequently determined to be a Dutch fishing vessel.|$|R
60|$|Inside of the <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> he {{had covered}} a {{territory}} of many yards {{on both sides}} of the brook. In one spot he had seen several drops of blood and the finger marks of a bloody hand. Yellow Elk, however, had completely disappeared.|$|E
60|$|For the <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> {{the door}} at the further end of the room {{continued}} to open and close, devouring, ogre-fashion, each time some dainty human morsel, now chorus gentleman, now chorus lady.

6000|$|... "Must I?" [...] said she, plaintively. And {{then she}} sat for the <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> {{with her head}} against his shoulder; but nothing more was said about it.

2500|$|The Guardian {{published}} on 30 March 2007 a story detailing inconsistencies between an account Blair gave of {{his involvement in}} the Balcombe Street Siege on the night of 6 December 1975, and the recollections of others involved at the time. In a 2006 interview, Blair had stated: [...] "We turned the corner, and there is the car ... It was a very defining moment. I think I spent the <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> pretending to be a bush. They {{got out of the car}} and started firing at us. It is an interesting experience being fired at when you have absolutely nothing to fire back with ... I loved it. I loved the job." ...|$|R

The fire's eating back into the bush all the while." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{considerable}} {{discussion with}} Tim {{he decided to}} leave it behind the cane-board {{where it would be}} screened from view, and then a crowd of customers suddenly appearing, he was so busy during the <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> that he hardly had time to think of that which had been intrusted to his keeping.|$|E
60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> was one Ben never forgot.

Many had exhausted their ammunition, and were using their bayonets or else handling their guns as clubs.|$|E

5000|$|The EU {{parking disc}} design was {{introduced}} in 2000 and the old designs abolished in 2003.

60|$|Knight in his perplexity {{stood still}} for a moment, and {{collected}} his thoughts. The vicar's account {{of the fall of}} the tower was that the workmen had been undermining it all the day, and had left in the evening intending to give the finishing stroke the <b>next</b> morning. <b>Half</b> an <b>hour</b> after they had gone the undermined angle came down. The woman who was half buried, as it seemed, must have been beneath it at the moment of the fall.|$|R

6000|$|... "Faith, man! but {{you wear}} a glum face! As for me, I could dance with joy! Surely {{there is no longer}} any cause for fear.

60|$|Doctor Gys had rather impatiently {{awaited the}} young man's return to {{consciousness}} {{that he might}} complete his examination. He now devoted the <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> to a careful diagnosis of Denton's injuries. By this time the patient was suffering intense pain and a hypodermic injection of morphine was required to relieve him. When at last he was quietly drowsing the doctor called Maud aside to give her instructions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay {{where you}} are," [...] Wilhelmina {{answered}} shortly. Her {{eyes were fixed}} upon the tall, lithe figure once more facing the bowler. The next ball {{was the last of}} the over. Macheson played it carefully for a single, and stood prepared for the bowling at the other end. He began by a graceful cut for two, and followed it up by a square leg hit clean out of the ground. For the <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour,</b> the Thorpe villagers thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Never since the days of one Foulds, a former blacksmith, had they seen such an exhibition of hurricane hitting. The fast bowler, knocked clean off his length, became wild and erratic. Once he only missed Macheson's head by an inch, but his next ball was driven fair and square out of the ground for six. The applause became frantic.|$|R
5000|$|... "D" [...] Company's attack went in {{as planned}} at 0400 hours on 30 March. Finding their line of retreat {{cut off the}} German paratroopers decided to stand and fight. After seven hours of bitter street {{fighting}} a truce was called to evacuate the wounded on both sides. Making use of the truce, Sweeting issued the German commander an ultimatum, surrender within the <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> or be totally destroyed. Realizing his position hopeless, the German commander surrendered. Of the original company from the 17th Fallschirmjäger Regiment of the 6th Fallschirmjäger Division garrisoning Netterden, only 2 officers and 22 soldiers survived to go into captivity as prisoners of war. During their two days in the area the battalion captured a total of 2 enemy officers and 128 other ranks {{at a cost of}} 4 Camerons killed and 10 wounded. For his successful company attack on Netterden Major Sweeting received the Distinguished Service Order.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a letter}} the <b>next</b> day. <b>Half</b> an <b>hour</b> after {{receiving}} it I found Cecile sunk {{down on the floor}} of her apartment, upon which all her wardrobe was strewn about as if to be packed up. She fell into my arms weeping passionately, and declaring she must leave us. to leave us and set up her menage with her husband had always been her ambition, so it was plain that this was not what she meant; but for a long time she neither would nor could tell me, or moan out anything but a 'convent,' 'how could he?' and 'my children.' ...|$|R
