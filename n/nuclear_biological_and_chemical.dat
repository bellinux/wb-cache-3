25|$|Boorda was {{particularly}} interested in C4I initiatives to place command and control, communications, computers and intelligence assets on naval ships. Essentially this manifested itself as more robust combat information systems, with improved satellite and communication links, as well as place more defensive assets on traditionally non-combatant ships such as support vessels. Boorda initiated efforts during the proposal phase for the future LPD-17 amphibious class to be fitted with first-class C4I suites, radars, communications, and defense systems-anti-torpedo, anti-missile, and anti-NBC (<b>nuclear,</b> <b>biological,</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical)</b> - along with blast-hardened bulkheads that will absorb and dissipate much more punishment than is possible with present designs. This effort was a departure from past efforts which relied on simply assigning a destroyer or cruiser to provide these functions for amphibious forces. The ship was commissioned January 14, 2006, nine years after Boorda's death.|$|E

The threshold levels of sensors at the inspection stations affect the probabilities of incorrectly accepting or rejecting a container.

25|$|John Finn is the 63rd Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, {{the first}} of which, , was {{commissioned}} in July 1991. With 75 ships planned {{to be built in}} total, the class has the longest production run for any U.S. Navy surface combatant. As an Arleigh Burke-class ship, John Finns roles included anti-aircraft, anti-submarine, and anti-surface warfare, as well as strike operations. During its long production run, the class was built in three flights: Flight I (DDG-51–DDG-71), Flight II (DDG-72–DDG-78), and Flight IIA (DDG-79–DDG-126). John Finn will be a Flight IIA ship, and as such, will feature several improvements in terms of ballistic missile defense, an embarked air wing (two MH-60R Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System helicopters), and the inclusion of mine-detecting ability. DDG-51 was also the first class of ships in the U.S. Navy to include anti-NBC (<b>Nuclear,</b> <b>Biological,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chemical)</b> warfare protection.|$|E
25|$|Overcoming Soviet {{objections}} to a united Germany's membership in NATO was of key importance. This was accomplished in July when the alliance, led by President George H.W. Bush, issued the London Declaration on a transformed NATO. On 16 July, President Gorbachev and Chancellor Kohl announced the {{agreement in principle}} on a united Germany in NATO. This {{cleared the way for}} the signing in Moscow, on 12 September, of the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany—in effect the peace treaty that was anticipated at the end of World War II. In addition to terminating Four Power rights, the treaty mandated the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Germany by the end of 1994, made clear that the current borders (especially the Oder-Neisse line) were viewed as final and definitive, and specified the right of a united Germany to belong to NATO. It also provided for the continued presence of British, French, and American troops in Berlin during the interim period of the Soviet withdrawal. In the treaty, the Germans renounced <b>nuclear,</b> <b>biological,</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons and stated their intention to reduce the (combined) German armed forces to 370,000 within 3 to 4 years after the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, signed in Paris on 19 November 1990, entered into force.|$|E
500|$|During the journey, Cardiffs crew {{performed}} various training exercises, including defence against {{air attack}} (involving simulation runs by friendly Harrier and Jaguar aircraft), <b>nuclear,</b> <b>biological,</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons and Exocet anti-ship missiles. All British Type 42's {{involved in the}} war were instructed to paint two vertical black stripes down either side {{the middle of their}} ships. This would allow the Royal Navy submarines to distinguish them from the two Argentine Type 42's. On 22 May, an Argentine reconnaissance Boeing 707, no.TC-92 of the Argentine Air Force's [...] (Spanish for [...] "2nd Air Transport Squadron, Group 1"), was fired on by Cardiff. The aircraft was detected while shadowing the Bristol group, and Cardiff was ordered to drop back and engage. The ship fired two Sea Darts at the aircraft at 11:40 (local time) from maximum range; the first fell short and second missed due to evasive manoeuvres taken by the aircraft's crew. After the attack, TC-92 dropped below radar level and returned to El Palomar. On 25 May, Cardiff was tasked with the recovery of four Special Air Service (SAS) troopers, who had parachuted from a C-130 Hercules passing over the destroyer.|$|E
