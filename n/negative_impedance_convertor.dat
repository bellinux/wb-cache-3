40|$|A {{broadside}} radiating, linearly polarized, electrically small Huygens source {{antenna system}} that has a large impedance bandwidth is reported. The bandwidth performance is facilitated by embedding non-Foster components into the near-field resonant parasitic elements of this metamaterial-inspired antenna. High-quality and stable radiation performance characteristics are achieved over the entire operational bandwidth. When the ideal non-Foster components are introduced, the simulated impedance bandwidth witnesses approximately a 17 -fold enhancement over the passive case. Within this - 10 -dB bandwidth, its maximum realized gain, radiation efficiency, and front-to-back ratio (FTBR) are, respectively, 4. 00 dB, 88 %, and 26. 95 dB. When the anticipated actual <b>negative</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>convertor</b> circuits are incorporated, the impedance bandwidth still sustains more than a 10 -fold enhancement.
