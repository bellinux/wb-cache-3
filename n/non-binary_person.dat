The {{cast of the}} webcomic competes {{in a series of}} games in order to prove themselves to be the most competent magician, but one competitor, the confident and suave <b>non-binary</b> <b>person</b> Lucy, managed to stay in the running without using any kind of magic at all. Lucy is able to do this with the help of their familiar cat Ivy, as well as through resourcefulness and luck, but may also hold a more complex secret.|$|E
5000|$|Unemployment {{rates for}} {{transgender}} people are approximately {{twice as high}} as those for cisgender people. In the National Transgender Discrimination Survey conducted by the LGBTQ+ Task Force, it was found that almost all non-binary persons had experienced discrimination in the workplace. Their findings show that being out as a <b>non-binary</b> <b>person</b> negatively affects that person's employment outcomes. Though non-binary persons have higher unemployment rates than those who identify with a specified gender, masculine non-binary persons who still appear male, or are not [...] "passing as female" [...] generally have a harder time in the work environment.|$|E

40|$|Research {{shows that}} HIV {{prevalence}} in transgender and <b>non-binary</b> <b>persons</b> is extremely high, with prevalence rates ranging up to 52. 4 % (Edwards et al., 2007). This high risk {{is associated with}} a number of (trans-specific) factors, such as stigma, discrimination, normative gender roles, involvement in sex work, a lack of knowledge about safe sex and an inaccurate perception of risk. This article critically reviews the last 10 years of research on transgender and <b>non-binary</b> <b>persons</b> and sexual risk from a feminist intersectional perspective that focuses on gender identity, class, ethnicity and other axes of difference that contribute to the high risk for HIV for (some) transgender and <b>non-binary</b> <b>persons.</b> There appears to be an interweaving of different factors in which the discrimination and stigmatisation of transgender and <b>non-binary</b> <b>persons</b> is central. The limitations and pitfalls of current research are pointed out, and suggestions for policy and further research are made...|$|R

5000|$|The State Department was {{sued for}} denying Dana Zzyym {{who is a}} veteran and an {{intersex}} and <b>non-binary</b> <b>person</b> a passport. Zzyym wrote “intersex” of their passport instead of the only two options of male or female. Zzyym was denied the passport and shortly after LGBTQ advocacy organizations filed suit on Zzyym’s behalf against the U.S. State Department. The advocacy group Lambda Legal argued for gender-neutral terms and a third option on U.S. passports. Paul Castillo represented Zzyym from Lambda Legal that stated the action violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clause in the U.S. Consitution. The State Department made the argument that it would prevent the efforts against identity theft and passport fraud for their system to validate the identity and citizenship of passport applicants. The Tenth Circuit Court {{ruled in favor of}} Zzyym, {{the first time in history}} that the federal government recognized non-binary people.|$|E
5000|$|Non-heterosexuality {{is often}} used to {{describe}} those in the LGBT+ community with non-cisgender identities. This is seen as problematic as sexual orientation and gender identity are different. However the distinction between the two is relatively modern. Historically “people were classified as homosexuals by everyone, including the physicians who specialized in their treatment, and {{it is only in the}} past fifty years or so that transgender has been theorized as different in kind from homosexuality.” [...] Many people still fail to understand or make the distinction between gender minorities and sexual minorities. The term itself is sexuality specific as it contains the word “sexual” with no mention of “gender.” [...] Much in the way the term non-heterosexuality erases sexual minorities through its implied notion of the hetero/homosexual binary, it also ignores gender minorities. While trans* people and people with non-binary gender identities are part of the LGBTQ community, having been subjected to many of the same injustices, labelling trans* and genderqueer identities under the term non-heterosexual blurs the important differences between sexual orientation and gender identity. Not all trans* people would identify their sexuality as being non-heterosexual, many trans* people are attracted to the ‘opposite’ sex and therefore identify as heterosexual. Additionally “those with non-binary gender identities are likely to place themselves in a position in which heterosexuality is nonsensical, due to there being no “opposite” gender to their identities” [...] While a <b>non-binary</b> <b>person</b> is less likely to identify as heterosexual, the assumption that as someone with a ‘non-heterosexual’ identity, they must be homosexual is also problematic as it ignores sexual orientations that are not dictated by the gender of the person but rather who they are (or are not) attracted to such as bisexual, pansexual, queer, androsexual, gynesexual, skoliosexual, or asexual.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} ways in which individuals who identify with nonbinary gender identities 1) understand and perform their gender identities and 2) navigate the workplace, intimate partner relationships, friendships, and the LGBTQ+ community. Prevailing understandings of gender rely on a gender binary; identification with a binary gender is compulsory. Individuals are assigned a gender at birth and are expected to identify fully with that gender for their entire lives. However, despite significant social pressures to identify as man or woman, there exist individuals whose identities bring into question the stability of the gender binary. Non-binary is sometimes used to describe individuals who do not identify solely or fully as man or woman. Fifteen interviews were conducted with individuals living in the Portland Metro Area who included non-binary as part or all of their gender identity. Questions included general descriptive information, questions about participants’ conceptions of masculinity and femininity, and questions regarding their experiences as a <b>non-binary</b> <b>person</b> {{in the context of the}} workplace, intimate partner relationships, friendships, and the LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, plus) community. It was found that non-binary individuals are largely held accountable to a normative performance of gender by friends, intimate partners, employers, and coworkers. While non-binary individuals are constrained by the gender structure at the individual, interactional, and institutional levels, they also appear to push back against these constraints in small but meaningful ways. Results from this study provide insight into a group of people which has been largely left out of the literature...|$|E

50|$|Although {{there is}} no {{official}} policy, the Judicial Council of the UMC ruled, in 2008, that ordained transgender pastors could serve in congregations within the denomination. In particular, the first openly transgender pastor within the UMC received overwhelming support from his congregation. In 2016, the South Carolina Annual Conference passed a resolution urging support for non-discrimination protections for transgender people. In 2017, the Northern Illinois Conference commissioned M Barclay as a Deacon {{and became the first}} openly <b>non-binary</b> trans <b>person</b> commissioned in the denomination.|$|R
50|$|The only {{instance}} of a <b>non-binary</b> identified <b>person</b> {{that has become}} significant {{in the mainstream media}} is the video Break Free, created by Ruby Rose. As of November 20, 2014, the video had garnered 1,833,889 views. Additionally, there was a Buzzfeed article written about the video, which received widespread media attention. The original Facebook post on Ruby Rose's official Facebook page has received over 135,000 likes, and 182,000 shares as of November 2014. Activist Jeffrey Marsh has also made significant strides in genderqueer representation on the Vine social media platform.|$|R
40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{is identified}} much later and less often in females than in males. Some researchers suspect that {{a different set}} of characteristics of ASD in females may not be consistent with the more established and widely recognized characteristics of ASD, leading to under-identification in women. In the present study, four women and one <b>non-binary</b> feminine-presenting <b>person</b> with ASD were interviewed. The five participants conveyed their experiences with social-pragmatic communication, and their views on gender, ASD, and gender differences in ASD. The results are discussed in relationship to the limited amount of past research on women with ASD...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} mapping undercommon appositionality—as an epistemological and ontological formation—provides a complementary corrective to identitarian “subject positions. ” It does this by accounting for structural and institutional displacements that are simultaneously constitutive of and oppositional to black (queer) femme [B(Q) F] subjectivities. In this project, I study B(Q) F subjects’ everyday negotiations with structural order that present as forms of cultural expression responsive to three systemic structural patterns: antiblackness, misogyny/misogynoir, and queer antagonism. I analyze {{the ways that}} intersectional activism and scholarship inform lived experience and, in so doing, can catalyze ontological and epistemological affirmation. For black queer women and femmes, surviving the ongoing violence of dispossession requires the creation and discursive circulation of pro-black, pro-queer, and pro-feminine knowledges without which social death is ontologically substantiated as the dominant organizing logic reducing social life to bare life. The dissertation’s case studies are organized into conceptual onto-epistemic archives: Liberation, Refusal, Exception, and Intimacy. In the first case study, I follow the work of activist-scholar Barbara Smith as it overlaps with the efforts of London’s Black Lesbian and Gay Centre. I begin {{with a discussion of}} black LGBT activism and scholarship highlighting the contemporary beginning of an explicitly black queer femme topos of political action in the 1980 s US and UK. The next chapter explores black queer femme advocacy by illuminating the ways that one queer dandy style movement further complicates how gender functions to delimit social relationships. The third study takes up social relationships, thinking through B(Q) F socialities by exploring the ways that legal policy, media representation, and cultural ideologies reproduce structural violence impacting the everyday lives of trans and gender <b>non-binary</b> <b>persons.</b> Finally, I turn toward the interiority of B(Q) F affective discourse to think through what dispossession entails in the realm of interpersonal, erotic intimacy as themes emerge in autoethnography, oral history, and two black women’s creative works: Solange Knowles's A Seat at the Table and Gayl Jones’ Eva’s Man. This progression of OEAs moves from the formation of community to the autonomous recognition of subjectivity, generating a narrative of black (queer) femme sociality along the way...|$|R
