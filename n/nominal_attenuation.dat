40|$|The {{design of}} the WFC 3 UVIS and IR {{detector}} vent tubes is intended {{to assure that the}} stray light on the science detectors from illumination by the bright Earth at the vent tube radiator openings is greatly attenuated. The limits on that stray light and the <b>nominal</b> <b>attenuation</b> required in order that the scientific quality of images is not significantly degraded are presented here. The stray light signal rate in the UVIS detector should be less than 5. 0 electrons/sec/cm 2, and less than 75 electrons/sec/cm 2 for the IR detector. In order to meet these limits, the incident flux of the bright Earth on the vent tube opening must be attenuated at the detector by greater than 2 × 1016 in the UVIS channel and 3 × 1015 in the IR channel...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we present}} {{preliminary}} {{results of the}} integration of two recently proposed vortex coronagraph (VC) concepts for on-axis telescopes on the Stellar Double Coronagraph (SDC) bench behind PALM- 3000, the extreme adaptive optics system of the 200 -inch Hale telescope of Palomar observatory. The multi-stage vortex coronagraph (MSVC) uses {{the ability of the}} vortex to move light in and out of apertures through multiple VC in series to restore the <b>nominal</b> <b>attenuation</b> capability of the charge 2 vortex regardless of the aperture obscurations. The ring-apodized vortex coronagraph (RAVC) is a one-stage apodizer exploiting the VC Lyot-plane amplitude distribution in order to perfectly null the diffraction from any central obscuration size, and for any vortex topological charge. The RAVC is thus a simple concept that makes the VC immune to diffraction effects of the secondary mirror. It combines a vortex phase mask in the image plane with a single pupil-based amplitude ring apodizer, tailor-made to exploit the unique convolution properties of the VC at the Lyot-stop plane. The prototype apodizer uses the same microdot technology that was used to manufacture the apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) equipping SPHERE, GPI and P 1640...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether lateralization judgements show adaptation during a period of unilateral ear plugging. Six normally hearing young adults were tested repeatedly using pure tone stimuli of 500 and 4000 Hz to determine (i) the threshold in each ear, (ii) the interaural sensation level difference (ISLD) at which sounds presented alternately to the two ears were of equal loudness, and (iii) the ISLD at which sounds presented simultaneously to the two ears produced a centered internal sound image. Subjects were tested 9 – 14 times over one week before an ear plug, producing a <b>nominal</b> <b>attenuation</b> of 21 dB (at both frequencies), was placed in one ear. Subjects wore the plug continuously for a further week, and were tested daily during this period, with the plug in place. After unplugging, subjects were tested less frequently for one final week. Net changes in binaural hearing were measured by subtracting the equal loudness ISLD from the centering ISLD. Four subjects showed no net change, either during or after plugging, but a small (< 3 dB) adaptation occurred during plugging in two subjects...|$|E
50|$|A {{stopband}} is {{a band of}} frequencies, between specified limits, {{through which}} a circuit, such as a filter or telephone circuit, does not allow signals to pass, or the attenuation is above the required stopband attenuation level. Depending on application, the required attenuation within the stopband may typically be a value between 20 and 120 dB higher than the <b>nominal</b> passband <b>attenuation,</b> which often is 0 dB.|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} model is presented {{which will help}} guide and interpret an upcoming series of experiments on nonlinear compressional waves in marine sediments. The model includes propagation physics of nonlinear acoustics augmented with granular Hertzian stress of order 3 / 2 in the strain rate. The model is {{a variant of the}} time domain NPE (McDonald and Kuperman, 1987) supplemented with a causal algorithm for frequency-linear attenuation. When attenuation is absent, the model equations are used to construct analytic solutions for nonlinear plane waves. The results imply that Hertzian stress causes a unique nonlinear behavior near zero stress. A fluid, in contrast, exhibits nonlinear behavior under high stress. A numerical experiment with <b>nominal</b> values for <b>attenuation</b> coefficient implies that in a water saturated Hertzian chain, the nonlinearity near zero stress may be experimentally observable...|$|R
40|$|Large core, Step-Index Plastic Optical Fiber (SIPOF) is a cheap {{alternative}} to existing copper network interconnects. The low material, production and installation costs {{come at the}} price of large values of attenuation and intermodal dispersion for fibers reaching beyond 50 m. For a 150 m, 150 Mb/s link, the dispersion induced optical power penalty can be as large as 13 dB. Combined with a <b>nominal</b> <b>attenuation</b> of up to 0. 22 dB/m, the signal drops under the sensitivity levels of current POF receivers. A non-intrusive solution to this problem could be receiver side electronic equalization. To ease integration with existing receivers and keep power consumption low, an analog implementation is proposed. As the optical channel does not behave like any low order electrical system, the design of an electrical filter with a fully matched response could result in a very complex system. Therefore, the performance of a general, low order, electrical filter was evaluated and compared with the theoretical case of full equalization in high level simulations. Based on these results, a 2 biquad adaptive gm-C filter was designed and implemented in a blind adaptive equalizer. The filter allows for individually tunable low and high frequency gain, enabling equalization of a 150 Mb/s link for fiber lengths ranging from 1 to 150 m. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Despite a {{high level}} of sound {{exposure}} and a fairly large selection of earplugs available, musicians have often been reported to use personal hearing protectors only seldom. For better hearing conservation, it is important to identify and eliminate the causes for the low motivation to use hearing protection. We explored the usage rate of custom-molded musician′s earplugs (ER- 15) among 15 symphony orchestra musicians with a questionnaire, and measured the attenuation properties of their earplugs with a Real-Ear Attenuation at Threshold (REAT) procedure in a sound field. Earplug use was found to be low, and the musicians reported that earplugs hampered listening to their own and their colleagues′ playing; earplugs affected either timbre or dynamics, or both. Additionally, several reasons related to discomfort of use were itemized, but the musicians who consistently used their earplugs did so in spite of problems with use. The REAT values obtained in sound field were relatively close to the manufacturer′s nominal specifications, being 13. 7 dB, on average. In the frequency range studied (0. 125 - 8 kHz), individual variation in REAT was, however, up to 15 dB across the measured frequencies. Fluctuation in attenuation might be related to low use of hearing protectors, and REAT measured at fixed center frequencies may be too robust a method to uncover it. We therefore tested 10 additional subjects to find out whether a sweeping signal used in Bιkιsy audiometry would bring more detailed information on earplug attenuation. Mean attenuation was found to be somewhat closer to the <b>nominal</b> <b>attenuation</b> of the ER- 9 and ER- 15 earplugs up to about 1 kHz, whereas REAT measurements in sound field revealed more even attenuation at frequencies between 1 and 6 kHz. No significant association was found between earplug attenuation properties and earplug use. It was concluded that support and determination to get accustomed to hearing protector use are important factors in hearing conservation...|$|E
