500|$|When Lennon went to Hamburg {{again in}} April 1962, {{she found a}} bedsit in a terraced house at 93 Garmoyle Road, Liverpool. Shortly after having failed her art teacher's diploma exam, in August 1962, she found she was {{pregnant}} with Lennon's child. She later explained that she and Lennon had never used contraception, had <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it, and didn't think about it at the time.

500|$|Proponents of the Bricker Amendment {{said this}} {{language}} made it essential {{to add to}} the Constitution explicit limitations on the treaty-making power. Raymond Moley wrote in 1953 that Holland meant [...] "the protection of an international duck takes precedence over the constitutional protections of American citizens". In response, legal scholars such as Professor Edward Samuel Corwin of Princeton University said the language of the Constitution regarding treaties—"under the authority of the United States"—was misunderstood by Holmes, and was written to protect the 1783 peace treaty with Britain; this became [...] "in part the source of Senator Bricker's agitation". Professor Zechariah Chafee of Harvard Law School wrote, [...] "the Framers <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> having treaties on the same level as the Constitution. What they did want was to make sure a state could no longer flout any lawful action taken by the nation". Chafee claimed that the word [...] "Supreme", as used in ArticleVI, simply meant [...] "supreme over the states".|$|E

Nicky {{graduated}} from Holy Spirit High School in Absecon, New Jersey, in 1983. By one account, Nicky Scarfo Jr. {{was not involved in}} crime during his teens, and did not intend to become involved in the syndicate.

[...] Ernst, like Avey, refused to burden anyone with his own suffering and <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> Auschwitz until very late in life. But, says Avey, [...] "I, too, have left it late. I will always regret not tracking Ernst down while he was alive. If I’d known he was living in America, I would have gone and found him, without doubt. But I am proud to have played a small part in helping one man through the obscenity of Auschwitz." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around {{this time}} he met two composers who were to be {{important}} influences: John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. His friendship with Cage began in 1949 when Cage was visiting Paris. Cage introduced Boulez to two publishers (Heugel and Amphion) who agreed to take his recent pieces; Boulez helped to arrange a private performance of Cage’s Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano. When Cage returned to New York they began an intense, six-year correspondence {{about the future of}} music. In 1952 Stockhausen arrived in Paris to study with Messiaen. Although Boulez knew no German and Stockhausen no French, the rapport between them was instant: [...] "A friend translated [...] we gesticulated wildly... We talked about music all the time—in a way I've <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it with anyone else." ...|$|E

2500|$|In mid-1972, Jobs {{moved back}} to the San Francisco Bay Area and was renting his own apartment. Brennan states by this point that their [...] "relationship was complicated. I couldn't break the {{connection}} and I couldn't commit. Steve couldn't either." [...] Jobs hitchhiked and worked around the West Coast and Brennan would occasionally join him. At the same time, Brennan notes, [...] "little by little, Steve and I separated. But we were never able to fully let go. We <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> breaking up or going our separate ways and we didn't have that conversation where one person says it's over." [...] They continued to grow apart, but Jobs would still seek her out, and visit her while she was working in a health food store or as a live-in babysitter.

2500|$|According to Fumiyo Kōno's afterword, she was {{prompted}} to write Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms when her editor {{asked her for}} a Hiroshima story. She was initially reluctant because, while {{she was born in}} Hiroshima neither she nor anyone in her family was a survivor of the atomic bomb, and growing up she found the subject upsetting and had tried to avoid it ever since. She decided to tackle the subject because she felt it was [...] "unnatural and irresponsible for me to consciously try to avoid the issue." [...] Living in Tokyo, she had come to realize that people outside of Hiroshima and Nagasaki didn't know about the effects of the bomb, not because they were avoiding the subject but because it is <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about,</b> and so she attempted the story because [...] "drawing something is better than drawing nothing at all." ...|$|E

It was two months later that they decided to do a reunion concert, which led to a 102 date tour.

[...] In 1965, the U.S. Army published a multi-volume history of World War II, The Ardennes: The Battle of the Bulge. Author Hugh M. Cole mentioned Bouck's platoon in passing, which upset platoon member William James (Tsakanikas).

2500|$|A {{suspect profile}} report {{created by the}} National Criminal Investigation Service in Norway (Kripos) {{concluded}} that there was only one perpetrator since both victims were killed in a way that could not be copied by another person.

According to Kristiansen's lawyer, Arvid Sjødin, Andersen also told the police that he had <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> this method with Kristiansen. (The interrogation transcripts are not publicly available) The suspect profile report was neither presented for the court, nor for the lawyers.
