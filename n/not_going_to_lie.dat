500|$|In a Guardian interview, Minaj {{said she}} competes with {{male and female}} rappers. In [...] "Moment 4 Life", she refers to herself as a [...] "king" [...] rather than a queen. Early in her career Minaj claimed to be bisexual, but {{eventually}} she said she just did that to get attention. [...] "I think girls are sexy, but I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> and say that I date girls." ...|$|E
500|$|Some things {{explored}} in the album were Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, {{the corruption of}} Las Vegas, and his incarceration in prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related {{to the death of}} Michael Cook. Radke stated that he chose not to write any songs about love because, [...] "...I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> ... and try to write songs on how much I love somebody. I do have love, but {{there will be a lot}} of songs about just what I’ve been through." [...] Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after they kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt, with songs on the album that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate bassist Max Green. Prior to the album's release, Radke discussed what he intended to say about Escape the Fate on certain tracks, stating in an interview that he believed that the band's first album without Radke, This War Is Ours, was named after the conflict over Mabbitt taking over Radke's position in Escape the Fate. The band has since claimed it was not written about Radke, but he did not believe them.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, but once you get into the game you're not going to think too much about it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's going to be fun seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie,</b> it's a little weird for me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win". The Canucks lost the game 5–2, {{finishing}} the month with 31 points, four points out of the final playoff spot.|$|E

2500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} the band's music is {{inspired}} mainly by vocalist Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, the corruption of Las Vegas, and his incarceration/release from prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related {{to the death of}} Michael Cook. No songs by the band to date concern love because Radke stated that, [...] "...I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> ... and try to write songs on how much I love somebody.

2500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot and {{directed}} by Chris Robinson. The president of Young Money Entertainment, Mack Maine, told MTV News, [...] "We're still {{trying to work out}} the date for the next video with [...] and Drake for the 'Moment 4 Life' video. That's the next project." [...] "Moment 4 Life" [...] is the first music video shot in a string of music videos to be released for promotion. In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Minaj revealed that Roman Zolanski's mother, Martha Zolanski, will make a physical debut in the music video. In an interview with MTV news, Minaj discussed the marriage concept of the music video between her and her label-mate Drake, stating [...] "Obviously, Drake and I, we’ve played around so much with the whole marriage thing and stuff like that, so people have come to be kind of intrigued about us and it’s where we’re shooting the video together. So I was like, {{there has to be some}} sort of romantic storyline. It’s Drake and me." [...] Drake additionally added [...] "I mean, it’s a fantasy video. You’ve got a very regal environment, and you’ve got Nicki doing what she does—big outfits, big everything. Yeah, I love that girl, man. I’m <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> to you. The twist of it, the concept of it, I don’t want to give it all away." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{recording}} session {{occurred in}} April 2005 {{in the garage}} of Stevens' Nashville, Tennessee home, which {{was used as a}} temporary studio. [...] "It was so hot in that garage the first session", guitarist Chris Rohman recalled in an interview. [...] "We go in there and we don't have the songs, we don't know what we're doing, we're stressed, he's stressed, and it's like 90 degrees [...] in the studio. Nobody wanted to be there." [...] Stevens began playing over the chords to [...] "I'm Not Alright", initially titled as [...] "I'll Be Fine", and at that point the band decided to rework the song's lyrical theme. [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie.</b> We're {{not going to try to}} sit here and try to sugarcoat what's happening right now or say something because it sounds good. I'm not alright", Matt Hammit said. The previous material they had written was lyrically [...] "shifted to the stuff we were going through at [...] point". [...] "I'm Not Alright", which became the album's lead single, was rewritten and represented the themes of brokenness and confession on The Face of Love. Mark Graalman noted: [...] "It's been an unbelievably hard year for the band. But we've learned to rely on God’s grace, and we've learned to be honest and transparent. [...] Being honest and transparent means not faking it; it has to be OK to say, 'No, I'm not alright'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Protests {{against the}} law {{extended}} to the arts and sports world as well. [...] Colombian pop singer Shakira came to Phoenix and gave a joint press conference against the bill with Mayor of Phoenix Phil Gordon. [...] Linda Ronstadt, of part Mexican descent and raised in Arizona, also appeared in Phoenix and said, [...] "Mexican-Americans are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take this <b>lying</b> down." [...] A May 16 concert in Mexico City's Zócalo, called Prepa Si Youth For Dignity: We Are All Arizona, drew some 85,000 people to hear Molotov, Jaguares, and Maldita Vecindad headline a seven-hour show in protest {{against the law}}.|$|R

6000|$|At Sligo, where I still {{went for}} my holidays, I stayed with my uncle, George Pollexfen, {{who had come}} from Ballina to fill the place of my {{grandfather}}, who had retired. My grandfather had no longer his big house, his partner William Middleton was dead, {{and there had been}} legal trouble. He was no longer the rich man he had been, and his sons and daughters were married and scattered. He had a tall, bare house overlooking the harbour, and had nothing to do but work himself into a rage if he saw a mudlighter mismanaged or judged from the smoke of a steamer that she was burning cheap coal, and to superintend the making of his tomb. There was a Middleton tomb and a long list of Middletons on the wall, and an almost empty place for Pollexfen names, but he had said, because there was a Middleton there he did not like, [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> with those old bones;" [...] and already one saw his name in large gilt letters on the stone fence of the new tomb. He ended his walk at St. John's churchyard almost daily, for he liked everything neat and compendious as upon shipboard, and if he had not looked after the tomb himself the builder might have added some useless ornament. He had, however, all his old skill and nerve. I was going to Rosses Point on the little trading steamer and saw him take the wheel from the helmsman and steer her through a gap in the channel wall, and across the sand, an unheard-of-course, and at the journey's end bring her alongside her wharf at Rosses without the accustomed zigzagging or pulling on a rope but in a single movement. He took snuff when he had a cold, but had never smoked or taken alcohol; and when in his eightieth year his doctor advised a stimulant, he replied, [...] "no, no, I am not going to form a bad habit." ...|$|E

5000|$|While {{a captain}} in the United States Army Reserve, Stephen Hill married Joshua Snyder in Washington, D.C., on May 3rd, 2011. [...] Same-sex {{marriage}} was legal in Washington, but not yet across the United States. They were married in the Congressional Cemetery at the grave site of their personal hero Leonard Matlovich whose stone reads [...] "When I was in the military {{they gave me a}} medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one." [...] The couple petitioned to have their surnames combined to Snyder-Hill in the state of Ohio, which did not recognize their marriage at the time.

Interviewed on Current TV's The War Room, Hill said “When the magistrate pulled us in there, she said that you can put any other reason on this application. … I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie.</b> That's one thing I have told myself since Don't Ask, Don't Tell was repealed.
