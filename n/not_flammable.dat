25|$|Most {{technically}} advanced Stirling engines, {{like those}} developed for United States government labs, use helium as the working gas, because it functions {{close to the}} efficiency and power density of hydrogen with fewer of the material containment issues. Helium is inert, and hence <b>not</b> <b>flammable.</b> Helium is relatively expensive, and must be supplied as bottled gas. One test showed hydrogen to be 5% (absolute) more efficient than helium (24% relatively) in the GPU-3 Stirling engine. The researcher Allan Organ demonstrated that a well-designed air engine is theoretically just as efficient as a helium or hydrogen engine, but helium and hydrogen engines are several times more powerful per unit volume.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 {{researchers}} of EPFL, Switzerland, {{reported the}} use of formic acid as a hydrogen storage material. Carbon monoxide free hydrogen has been generated in a very wide pressure range (1–600 bar). A homogeneous catalytic system based on water-soluble ruthenium catalysts selectively decompose HCOOH into H2 and CO2 in aqueous solution. This catalytic system overcomes the limitations of other catalysts (e.g. poor stability, limited catalytic lifetimes, formation of CO) for the decomposition of formic acid making it a viable hydrogen storage material. And the co-product of this decomposition, carbon dioxide, {{can be used as}} hydrogen vector by hydrogenating it back to formic acid in a second step. The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 has long been studied and efficient procedures have been developed. Formic acid contains 53 g L−1 hydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. By weight, pure formic acid stores 4.3 wt% hydrogen. Pure formic acid is a liquid with a flash point 69°C (cf. gasoline −40°C, ethanol 13°C). 85% formic acid is <b>not</b> <b>flammable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Helium was {{initially}} {{selected for the}} lifting gas {{because it was the}} safest to use in airships, as it is <b>not</b> <b>flammable.</b> One proposed measure to save helium was to make double-gas cells for 14 of the 16 gas cells; an inner hydrogen cell would be protected by an outer cell filled with helium, with vertical ducting to the dorsal area of the envelope to permit separate filling and venting of the inner hydrogen cells. At the time, however, helium was also relatively rare and extremely expensive as the gas was only available in industrial quantities from distillation plants at certain oil fields in the United States. Hydrogen, by comparison, could be cheaply produced by any industrialized nation and being lighter than helium also provided more lift. Because of its expense and rarity, American rigid airships using helium were forced to conserve the gas at all costs and this hampered their operation.|$|E

2500|$|In vehicle racing, {{nitrous oxide}} (often {{referred}} to as just [...] "nitrous") allows the engine to burn more fuel by providing more oxygen than air alone, resulting in a more powerful combustion. The gas is <b>not</b> <b>flammable</b> at a low pressure/temperature, but it delivers more oxygen than atmospheric air by breaking down at elevated temperatures. Therefore, it often is mixed with another fuel that is easier to deflagrate. Nitrous oxide is a strong oxidant, roughly equivalent to hydrogen peroxide, and much stronger than oxygen gas.|$|E
2500|$|Mixtures {{with air}} of the gas 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane are <b>not</b> <b>flammable</b> at {{atmospheric}} pressure and temperatures up to 100°C (212°F). However, mixtures with high concentrations of air at elevated pressure and/or temperature can be ignited. Contact of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane with flames or hot surfaces in excess of 250°C (482°F) may cause vapor decomposition and the emission of toxic gases including hydrogen fluoride and carbonyl fluoride. 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane itself has an [...] of 1,500g/m3 in rats, making it relatively non-toxic, apart from the dangers inherent to inhalant abuse. [...] Its gaseous form is denser than air and will displace air in the lungs. This can result in asphyxiation if excessively inhaled. This is what contributes to most deaths by inhalant abuse.|$|E

When inverted to spray liquid, the boiling fluorocarbon aerosol is easily ignitable, producing a very large blast of flame and extremely toxic gases such as hydrogen fluoride and carbonyl fluoride as combustion products.|$|R
50|$|The higher {{pressure}} and concentration of O2 in the bomb system can make compounds that are <b>not</b> normally <b>flammable</b> combustible, which {{is needed for}} this procedure, although some substances don’t combust completely, making the calculations harder once it have to take in consideration the remaining mass, making the possible error considerably bigger and compromising the data.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{condition}} for a liquid mixture not to flash {{is important in}} some cases, such as some process operation of aqueous–organic mixtures, applicability assessment of elimination of fire and explosion hazard by water in emergency response of the leakage of flammable liquids. Based on the flash point theory of binary aqueous–organic mixtures and the inerting effect on the flammability limits, a model to estimate the maximum quantity of <b>flammable</b> <b>not</b> to flash for an aqueous–organic mixture and its maximum flash point value was proposed. Validation of this model is conclusive with the experimental data for 5 miscible aqueous−organic mixtures. Overall, the model describes the experimental data of maximum flash point value and maximum quantity of <b>flammable</b> <b>not</b> to flash well...|$|R

As {{was the case with}} B, the fine fuels were comprised primarily of leaves that are <b>not</b> highly <b>flammable.</b> However, there was a greater proportion of fine live fuels (graminoids and herbs) relative to the other treatments. Reductions in basal area increased exposure, which, combined with a more flammable fuel bed, may facilitate fire in MB stands. However, predicted and observed fire intensity in the MB treatment was low relative to the other treatments (Waldrop et al. 2010).|$|R

50|$|Paper birch trees {{themselves}} have varied reactions to wildfire. A group, or stand, of paper birch is <b>not</b> particularly <b>flammable.</b> The canopy often {{has a high}} moisture content and the under story is often lush green. As such, conifer crown fires often stop once they reach a stand of paper birch or become slower moving ground fires. Since these stands are fire resistant they may become seed trees to reseed the area around them which was burned. However, in dry periods paper birch is flammable and will burn rapidly. As the bark is flammable it will often burn and may girdle the tree.|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s {{there was}} a lot of {{interest}} in fluorocarbons as anesthetics. The research did not come to anything, but a lot of effort was expended on the vital issue of flammability, and showed that the tested fluorocarbons were <b>not</b> <b>flammable</b> in air in any proportion, though most are in neat oxygen and neat nitrous oxide (gases of importance in anesthesiology).|$|E

25|$|Polypropylene, or 'polypro', {{has been}} used for the {{fabrication}} of cold-weather base layers, such as long-sleeve shirts or long underwear. Polypropylene is also used in warm-weather clothing, in which it transports sweat away from the skin. More recently, polyester has replaced polypropylene in these applications in the U.S. military, such as in the ECWCS. Although polypropylene clothes are <b>not</b> easily <b>flammable,</b> they can melt, which may result in severe burns if the wearer is involved in an explosion or fire of any kind. Polypropylene undergarments are known for retaining body odors which are then difficult to remove. The current generation of polyester does not have this disadvantage.|$|R
50|$|Core-based fires {{endanger the}} core and can cause the fuel {{assemblies}} to melt. A fire {{may be caused by}} air entering a graphite moderated reactor, or a liquid-sodium cooled reactor. Graphite is also subject to accumulation of Wigner energy, which can overheat the graphite (as happened at the Windscale fire). Light water reactors do <b>not</b> have <b>flammable</b> cores or moderators and are not subject to core fires. Gas-cooled civilian reactors, such as the Magnox, UNGG, and AGCR type reactors, keep their cores blanketed with non reactive carbon dioxide gas, which cannot support a fire. Modern gas-cooled civilian reactors use helium, which cannot burn, and have fuel that can withstand high temperatures without melting (such as the High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor and the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor).|$|R

5000|$|... "Freon" [...] is a {{trade name}} {{for a family of}} {{haloalkane}} refrigerants manufactured by DuPont and other companies. These refrigerants were commonly used due to their superior stability and safety properties: they were <b>not</b> <b>flammable</b> at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, nor obviously toxic as were the fluids they replaced, such as sulfur dioxide.

50|$|In early dirigibles, {{the lifting}} gas used was hydrogen, {{due to its}} high lifting {{capacity}} and ready availability.

30|$|Live fuel loads {{decreased}} due to {{the removal}} of the shrubby midstory layer. Fine fuels increased but probably are <b>not</b> highly <b>flammable</b> since they were mostly hardwood leaves and twigs that were partially consumed by the fire before falling to the ground. Such fuels tend to lie flat, which decreases their potential for burning, especially in protected sites on which fire behavior is constrained by high humidity. Since periodic fires in the B treatment reduce the rate of fuel accumulation, relative to M, the potential for high-intensity fire is reduced compared to that treatment (Waldrop et al. 2010). Consumption of 10 hr fuels by fire was offset by new additions from top-killed shrubs and saplings, which explains why there was little to no reduction in fuel volumes under this treatment scenario.|$|R
