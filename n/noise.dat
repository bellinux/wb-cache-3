5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove <b>noise</b> {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random <b>noise</b> in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random <b>noise</b> and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call band-limited white <b>noise.</b> For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white <b>noise</b> and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum <b>noise</b> performance.|$|E
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical <b>noise.</b> (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the <b>noise</b> in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of <b>noise</b> is called additive <b>noise,</b> with the understanding that the <b>noise</b> can be negative or positive at different instants of time. <b>Noise</b> that is not additive <b>noise</b> is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of <b>noise</b> will be omitted here.|$|E
5|$|In both {{recording}} and in live musical sound reinforcement, {{the key to}} <b>noise</b> minimisation is headroom. Headroom can be used either to reduce distortion and audio feedback by keeping signal levels low, or to reduce interference, both from outside sources and from the Johnson-Nyquist <b>noise</b> produced in the equipment, by keeping signal levels high. Most proprietary <b>noise</b> reducing technologies also introduce low levels of distortion. <b>Noise</b> minimisation therefore becomes a compromise between interference and distortion, both in {{recording and}} in live music, and between interference and feedback in live amplification. The work of Bart Kosko and Sanya Mitaim has also demonstrated that stochastic resonance {{can be used as}} a technique in <b>noise</b> minimisation and signal improvement in non-linear dynamical systems, as the addition of <b>noise</b> to a signal can improve the signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E

Different from the traditional robust filter {{based on the assumption that}} the process <b>noises</b> are uncorrelated with the measurement <b>noises,</b> the objective of the addressed robust filtering problem is to design a recursive filter such that, for packet losses and multiplicative <b>noises,</b> the state prediction and filtering covariance matrices have the optimized upper bounds in the case that there are correlated process and measurement <b>noises.</b> Two examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter...|$|R

5|$|In music, <b>noise</b> is {{variously}} {{described as}} unpitched, indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or unwanted sound. <b>Noise</b> {{is an important}} component of the sound of the human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours of <b>noise.</b> Traditional uses of <b>noise</b> are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre, such as the white <b>noise</b> component of a drum roll on a snare drum, or the transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes.|$|E

5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} <b>noise</b> that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found <b>noise</b> levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to <b>noise</b> at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. <b>Noise</b> on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, <b>noise</b> exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes.

5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed gratification is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud <b>noise</b> for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the <b>noise</b> were manipulated by one button turning off the <b>noise</b> for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the <b>noise</b> off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the <b>noise</b> immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their gratification for the relief of <b>noise</b> but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a new method that can remove view-disturbing <b>noises</b> from stereo images. One of the thorny {{problems}} in outdoor surveillance by a camera is that adherent <b>noises</b> such as waterdrops on the protecting glass surface lens disturb {{the view from}} the camera. Therefore, we propose a method for removing adherent <b>noises</b> from stereo images taken with a stereo camera system. Our method is based on the stereo measurement and utilizes disparities between stereo image pair. Positions of <b>noises</b> in images can be detected by comparing disparities measured from stereo images with the distance between the stereo camera system and the glass surface. True disparities of image regions hidden by <b>noises</b> can be estimated from the property that disparities are generally similar with those around <b>noises.</b> Finally, we can remove <b>noises</b> from images by replacing the above regions with textures of corresponding image regions obtained by the disparity referring. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
