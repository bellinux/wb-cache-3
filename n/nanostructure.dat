25|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs), {{also called}} buckytubes, are carbon molecules with a cylindrical <b>nanostructure.</b> They have a hollow structure with walls formed by one-atom-thick sheets of graphene. These sheets are rolled at specific and discrete ("chiral") angles, {{and the combination}} of chiral angle and radius controls properties such as electrical conductivity, electrolyte wettability and ion access. Nanotubes are categorized as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs). The latter have one or more outer tubes successively enveloping a SWNT, much like the Russian matryoshka dolls. SWNTs have diameters ranging between 1 and 3nm. MWNTs have thicker coaxial walls, separated by spacing (0.34nm) that is close to graphene's interlayer distance.|$|E
25|$|Metals {{can also}} be an {{effective}} way to confine light in structures equal to or smaller than the optical wavelength. This effect is emergent from the confined surface plasmon resonance induced by the resonating light, which, when confined to the surface of a <b>nanostructure</b> such as a gold channel or nanorod, induces electromagnetic resonance. Surface plasmon effects are strong in the visible range because the permittivity of a metal is very large and negative at visible frequencies. At frequencies higher than the visible range, the permittivity of a metal is closer to zero, and the metal stops being useful for focussing electric and magnetic fields. This effect was originally observed in radio and microwave engineering, where metal antennas and waveguides may be hundreds of times smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the same way, visible light can be constricted to the nano level with metal structures which form channels, tips, gaps, etc. Gold is also a convenient choice for nanofabrication because of its unreactivity and ease of use with chemical vapour deposition.|$|E
25|$|SAMs {{are also}} useful in {{depositing}} nanostructures, because each adsorbate molecule can {{be tailored to}} attract two different materials. Current techniques utilize the head to attract to a surface, like a plate of gold. The terminal group is then modified to attract a specific material like a particular nanoparticle, wire, ribbon, or other <b>nanostructure.</b> In this way, wherever the a SAM is patterned to a surface there will be nanostructures attached to the tail groups. One example {{is the use of}} two types of SAMs to align single wall carbon nanotubes, SWNTs. Dip pen nanolithography was used to pattern a 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA)SAM {{and the rest of the}} surface was passivated with 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) SAM. The polar solvent that is carrying the SWNTs is attracted to the hydrophilic MHA; as the solvent evaporates, the SWNTs are close enough to the MHA SAM to attach to it due to Van der Waals forces. The nanotubes thus line up with the MHA-ODT boundary. Using this technique Chad Mirkin, Schatz and their co-workers were able to make complex two-dimensional shapes, a representation of a shape created is shown to the right.|$|E

Seeman developed the more rigid double-crossover (DX) structural motif, and in 1998, in collaboration with Erik Winfree, published the creation of two-dimensional lattices of DX tiles. [...] These tile-based structures had the advantage that they provided the ability to implement DNA computing, which was demonstrated by Winfree and Paul Rothemund in their 2004 paper on the algorithmic self-assembly of a Sierpinski gasket structure, and for which they shared the 2006 Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology. Winfree's key insight was that the DX tiles could be used as Wang tiles, meaning that their assembly could perform computation.

Here, we present two processes based on electron-beam lithography to fabricate gold <b>nanostructures</b> for SERS. One process involves making use of metal lift-off and the other involves the use of the plasma etching. These two processes allow the successful {{fabrication of}} gold <b>nanostructures</b> with various kinds of geometrical shapes and different periodic arrangements. 4 -mercaptopyridine (4 -MPy) and Rhodamine 6 G (R 6 G) molecules are used to probe SERS signals on the <b>nanostructures.</b> The SERS investigations on the <b>nanostructured</b> substrates demonstrate that the gold <b>nanostructured</b> substrates have resulted in large SERS enhancement, which is highly dependent on the geometrical shapes and arrangements of the gold <b>nanostructures.</b> © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
