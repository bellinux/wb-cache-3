5|$|Following the Smolensk campaign, the Commonwealth was {{threatened}} by another {{attack by the}} Ottoman Empire. During the wars against Ottomans in 1633–1634 Władysław moved the Commonwealth army south of the Muscovy border, where {{under the command of}} hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski it forced the Turks to renew a peace treaty. In the resulting treaty, both countries agreed again to curb the border raids by Cossacks and the Tatars, and the Ottomans confirmed that the Commonwealth to be an independent power, and had <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> tribute to the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Lawsuits pending (House v. Price) such {{as whether}} cost-sharing {{subsidies}} must be paid. President Trump threatened <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> these subsidies in early 2017 and later decided to stop paying them. CBO estimated in September 2017 that discontinuing the payments would add an average of 15-20 percentage points to health insurance costs on the exchanges in 2018 while increasing the budget deficit nearly $200 billion over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Back in Azerbaijan, Bond {{discloses}} to M that Elektra {{may not be}} {{as innocent}} as she seems. An alarm sounds while he is handing M the locator card as proof of the theft, which reveals that the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an inspection rig heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig, a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the ransom money, and imprisons her in the Maiden's Tower.|$|E

5|$|In February 1988, plainclothes police {{officers}} forced Arias Calderón {{and his wife}} onto a plane to Costa Rica at gunpoint, and the couple spent a month in exile in Miami. Arias returned to Panama in March, calling openly for Noriega's ouster on arrival at the Omar Torrijos International Airport. In Panama's May 1989 elections, Arias stood {{as a candidate for}} First Vice President with the ADOC, with Guillermo Endara as the presidential candidate and Guillermo Ford as the candidate for Second Vice President. However, Noriega's government annulled the election before voting was complete. Days after the completion of voting, Endara, Arias, and Ford were attacked on camera by Noriega supporters while security forces observed and refused to intervene. In October of that year, Arias was briefly arrested for urging citizens <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> taxes to his government.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the issue}} of the papal bull Clericis laicos in 1296, forbidding the payment of taxes to a secular power, Winchelsey urged his clergy in 1297 to refuse {{payments}} to Edward. However, the clergy of the province of York paid a tax of a fifth of their revenues. Edward then declared clerics who refused to pay outlaws, and ordered their property to be seized. He conceded that the clergy could return to his protection if they paid a fine of a fifth of their revenues, exactly what the northern clergy had offered in the way of taxation. The royal clerks and many other clergy paid the fines, and in March, the southern clergy met again, and after a long debate, Winchelsey instructed each clerk to decide for himself whether or <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the fine. It appears that most chose to pay, but the archbishop still refused to make any contribution, and so Edward seized his lands. They were returned to him in July 1297, when the king and prelate were reconciled at Westminster. Winchelsey then tried to mediate between Edward and the earls, who also objected to Edward's tax demands.|$|E
5|$|The {{accounts}} differ as {{to exactly}} how the negotiations collapsed, but sources agree that their failure {{was the result of}} disputes within Zahir's inner circle between his financial adviser Ibrahim Sabbagh and his chief military commander, al-Dinkizli. Most accounts claim that Sabbagh urged Zahir <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Hasan's requested sums and agitated for war. Sabbagh argued that Zahir's treasury did not have the funds to pay the miri dues and that Zahir's forces were capable of defeating Hasan. Al-Dinkizli pressed Zahir to pay the amount, arguing that mass bloodshed could be averted. He advised Zahir to force Sabbagh to pay the amount if Zahir could not afford to himself. When the negotiations dragged on, Hasan pressed for a full repayment of the miri dues, warning Zahir that he would be executed if he failed to satisfy the demand. Zahir was insulted by Hasan's threat and in turn threatened to destroy Hasan's entire fleet unless he withdrew his ships.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} April a Flemish {{musician}} in Anne's service named Mark Smeaton was arrested. He initially denied {{being the}} Queen's lover but later confessed, perhaps tortured or promised freedom. Another courtier, Henry Norris, was arrested on May Day, but being an aristocrat, could not be tortured. Prior to his arrest, Norris was treated kindly by the King, who offered him his own horse to use on the May Day festivities. It seems likely that during the festivities, the King was notified of Smeaton's confession and it was shortly thereafter the alleged conspirators were arrested upon his orders. Norris denied his guilt and swore that Queen Anne was innocent; {{one of the most}} damaging pieces of evidence against Norris was an overheard conversation with Anne at the end of April, where she accused him of coming often to her chambers <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> court to her lady-in-waiting Madge Shelton but to herself. Sir Francis Weston was arrested two days later on the same charge, as was William Brereton, a groom of the King's Privy Chamber. Sir Thomas Wyatt, a poet and friend of the Boleyns who was allegedly infatuated with her before her marriage to the king, was also imprisoned for the same charge but later released, most likely due to his or his family's friendship with Cromwell. Sir Richard Page was also accused of having a sexual relationship with the Queen, but he was acquitted of all charges after further investigation could not implicate him with Anne. The final accused was Queen Anne's own brother, George Boleyn, arrested on charges of incest and treason. He was accused of two incidents of incest: November 1535 at Whitehall and the following month at Eltham.|$|E

25|$|To bypass DRM {{technologies}} {{embedded in}} video-streaming services, hackers employ {{a variety of}} methods.

25|$|In some locations, {{such as the}} United States, {{voluntary}} hospitalizations are {{outnumbered by}} involuntary commitments {{partly due to the}} fact that insurance tends <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for hospitalization unless an imminent danger exists to the individual or community. In addition, psychiatric emergency service settings admit approximately one third of patients from assertive community treatment centers. Therefore, patients who are not admitted will be referred to services in the community.|$|E

25|$|While most NBA teams hold {{contracts}} {{valued in}} excess of the salary cap, few teams have payrolls at luxury tax levels. The tax threshold in 2005–06 was $61.7million. In 2005–06, the New York Knicks' payroll was $124million, putting them $74.5million above the salary cap, and $62.3million above the tax line, which Knicks owner James Dolan paid to the league. Tax revenues are normally redistributed evenly among non-tax-paying teams, so there is often a several-million-dollar incentive to owners <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the luxury tax.|$|E

By 6 months of age infants have learned to treat acoustically different sounds that are representations of the same sound category, such as an /i/ spoken by a male versus a female speaker, as members of the same phonological category /i/.|$|E

25|$|Penn did {{not always}} pay {{attention}} to details, and had not taken the fairly simple step of determining where the 40th degree of latitude (the southern boundary of his land under the charter) actually was.

Kreis' design was a Public Works Administration project, and technically {{in violation of}} the new law, which said the federal government was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for its design.

The public acclaimed him, but the promoters set the critics against him.|$|E
