50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>kingfish</b> {{feeds on}} benthic invertebrates. The diet {{consists}} mainly of small crustaceans such as shrimps and crabs but amphipods, polychaete worms, molluscs, small fish and mysids are also eaten {{and it also}} scavenges on carrion.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>kingfish</b> is not fished commercially {{but from}} New Jersey southwards it {{provides}} good sport to surf anglers {{and those in}} boats close to the shore. The bait used can be pieces of squid, clams or bloodworms. The fish has tasty white meat.|$|E
5000|$|Menticirrhus saxatilis, the <b>{{northern}}</b> <b>kingfish</b> or northern kingcroaker, is {{a species}} of marine fish in the family Sciaenidae (commonly known as the [...] "drum" [...] or [...] "croaker" [...] family). It lives in the shallow coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
50|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>kingfish</b> is a subtropical, {{demersal}} fish found in shallow {{waters in the}} western Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from Massachusetts southwards through the Gulf of Mexico to the Yucatan peninsular of Mexico. It is found in schools in places where the seabed is sand or mud, in the surf zone and in estuaries. It can tolerate low salinity levels and the juveniles are often found in tidal rivers and creeks. It is occasionally seen in Maine and in this more northerly part of its range it is migratory, disappearing from October to May.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>kingfish</b> {{can grow}} to about 46 cm, {{but a more}} usual adult length is 30 cm. It is a slender fish, being most deep bodied in the {{pectoral}} region. As in most bottom-feeding fish, its upper jaw projects further than the lower and the snout overhangs the mouth. There is a small barbel on its fleshy lower lip. The dorsal fin {{is divided into two}} parts. The front part is triangular, short but tall with 10 spines, the third of which is the longest and is extended into a short filament. The other part of the dorsal fin is long and slightly tapered and has one spine and 24 to 27 soft rays. The pointed pectoral fins are quite large and the anal fin has 1 spine and 8 soft rays. The tailfin has a characteristic slightly concave upper lobe and a rounded lower lobe. The colour is dark grey with a metallic sheen and paler grey below. There are several diagonal bars of darker colour on the upper body. These mostly run towards the rear of the body but one or two bars near the head slope the other way. The fins are a dark colour, tipped with white. Unlike most members of its family, the <b>northern</b> <b>kingfish</b> has no air bladder, so the fish does not make the [...] "croaking" [...] sound that is characteristic of the family.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the late}} 20th century, whiting was a cheap fish, {{regarded}} as {{food for the}} poor or for pets. Whiting was also allegedly used as a filler in flour, beit wheat, barley or rye. In times of shortages, particularly in the eighteenth century, millers and bakers were commonly accused of using ground whiting to cut their flour as {{the costs of the}} fish was lower than that of the actual grain. The general decline in fish stocks means it is now more highly valued. The other fish that have been given the name whiting are mostly also edible fish. Several species of the drum, or croaker, family (Sciaenidae) are also called whiting, among them the <b>northern</b> <b>kingfish</b> (Menticirrhus saxatilis).|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{habitats}} {{make up the}} bay bottom; the dominant eelgrass Benthic habitat in the cove's of Patchogue Bay which can be classified as muddy sandflat and sandflat habitats. Many species that are found in both habitats. Sandy bottom types worms, slipper shell, and blue mussel, and mud crab. Atlantic oyster dril, a predator of bivalves, is abundant in eelgrass beds in Patchogue and Bellport Bay, and rock crab. The distribution and abundance of benthic species in the bay's eelgrass community is likely controlled {{by a number of}} factors that include eelgrass stem density, water temperature and salinity, sediment type, predation, food supply, and human harvest. Much of the bay is open water, while marshes and flats have developed on the protected northern edge of the barrier beach that shelters Patchogue Bay and the mainland from the Atlantic Ocean. Extensive tidal marshes and flats have developed on the bay side of Fire Island as well. Eelgrass beds are concentrated in the shallow waters along the back side of Fire Island, Silversides, killifish, menhaden, and bay anchovy. Forage fish species are found throughout the various aquatic habitats in the bay at different times of the year. Atlantic silverside, the most dominant member through much of the year, in most of the bay. Bay anchovy is the major mid-bay water column occupant in the summer during its spawning time in late June and July. Killifishes include mummichog in the salt marsh habitats, striped killifish over sandy habitat, and sheepshead minnow in both habitats. Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern pipefish s) is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American sandlance, probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters. The bay supports significant shellfishery for northern quahog and is a major spawning, nursery, and foraging area for blue crab. Other common aquatic species occurring in the backbarrier lagoon systems of Long Island include blue mussel, bay scallop, eastern oyster, horseshoe crab, American eel, spot, Atlantic croaker, <b>northern</b> <b>kingfish,</b> and northern puffer. There are a number of significant trout resources in streams that drain into The Bay. Nine of the twelve verified wild brook trout populations of Long Island occur in the Bay's drainage. Patchogue's Swan River, and many other local tributaries such as Mud Creek, Patchogue Creek, and Terrel Creek all contain naturally reproducing populations of brook trout.|$|E
