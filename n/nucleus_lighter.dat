2500|$|A fusion {{process that}} {{produces}} a <b>nucleus</b> <b>lighter</b> than iron-56 or nickel-62 will generally yield a net energy release. These elements have the smallest mass per nucleon and the largest binding energy per nucleon, respectively. Fusion of light elements toward these releases energy (an exothermic process), while a fusion producing nuclei heavier than these elements, will result in energy retained by the resulting nucleons, and the resulting reaction is endothermic. The opposite {{is true for the}} reverse process, nuclear fission. This means that the lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as uranium and plutonium, are more fissionable. The extreme astrophysical event of a supernova can produce enough energy to fuse nuclei into elements heavier than iron.|$|E
50|$|Photodisintegration is {{endothermic}} (energy absorbing) for atomic <b>nuclei</b> <b>lighter</b> than {{iron and}} sometimes exothermic (energy releasing) for atomic nuclei heavier than iron.

50|$|The semi-empirical {{mass formula}} {{provides}} a good fit to heavier nuclei, and a poor fit to very <b>light</b> <b>nuclei,</b> especially 4He. This is because the formula does not consider the internal shell structure of the <b>nucleus.</b> For <b>light</b> <b>nuclei,</b> it is usually better to use a model that takes this structure into account.|$|R
50|$|Besides elastic scattering, charged {{particles}} also undergo effects from their elementary charge, which repels {{them away from}} nuclei and causes their path to be curved inside an electric field. Particles can also undergo inelastic scattering and capture due to nuclear reactions. Protons and neutrons do this more often than heavier particles. Neutrons are also capable of causing fission in an incident <b>nucleus.</b> <b>Light</b> <b>nuclei</b> like deuterium and lithium can combine in nuclear fusion.|$|R

25|$|Fusion {{reactions}} {{occur when}} {{two or more}} atomic nuclei come close enough for long enough that the nuclear force pulling them together exceeds the electrostatic force pushing them apart, fusing them into heavier <b>nuclei.</b> For <b>nuclei</b> <b>lighter</b> than iron-56, the reaction is exothermic, releasing energy. For nuclei heavier than iron-56, the reaction is endothermic, requiring an external source of energy. Hence, nuclei smaller than iron-56 {{are more likely to}} fuse while those heavier than iron-56 are more likely to break apart.|$|R

Here we discuss a QCD motivated new 3 BF which should be included in studies of nuclei, in particular the light ones. We perform variational Monte Carlo calculations including this new 3 BF and discuss improvements brought in thereby for <b>light</b> <b>nuclei.</b> The study of <b>light</b> <b>nuclei</b> is of special significance, firstly as being composed of a few nucleons one hopes that their structure should be simple and secondly the understanding gained therefrom should be of basic importance for the study of heavier nuclei. It has therefore been somewhat of a surprise that these <b>light</b> <b>nuclei</b> themselves present several fundamental problems. It is however true that at present a rather good understanding has been achieved. However, there are still some open issues: (i) Is our variational wave function, having no explicit dependence on quantum chrodynamics (QCD) effects, complete?, (ii) Are ground-state energies of nuclei sensitive to QCD effects? And if so in what manner? The answer to these questions, shall be the focus of our attention here. For since over a decade, it has been known that the best microscopic calculations using successful two-body forces (2 BF) for <b>light</b> <b>nuclei</b> A = 3, 4 give underbinding and too large radii [1].
