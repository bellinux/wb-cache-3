40|$|China {{is joining}} {{the group of}} {{countries}} that have reasonably comprehensive systems of social protection in place. In 2010, the <b>National</b> <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> Congress adopted the first national Social Insurance Law, representing {{the culmination of a}} process of radical social reform. The question this paper asks is: what kind of welfare regime is being built in the <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> Republic of China? China has been politically unique. It is one of only five remaining communist states, the others being Cuba, Laos, the Democratic <b>People</b> 4 <b>s</b> Republic of Korea and Vietnam, and the only one (with some qualification for Vietnam) that has been economically successful. The characteristics of a communist state include centralized {{power in the hands of}} a party 9 lite and that this 9 lite is presumably motivated, to varying degrees, by some kind of socialist ideology of statism and social justice. While maintaining its political uniqueness, China has shed its economic uniqueness. With the reform and opening up that started in 1978, it turned its back on planned economy isolationism and has adopted an open socialist market economy. In considering what kind of welfare state is emerging in China, the paper looks at two hypotheses: is China producing a welfare state of its own kind, possibly a "socialist" welfare state? Or, if it is reproducing a conventional welfare state, what kind of previous experience elsewhere is it replicating...|$|R

40|$|While {{the protein}} {{composition}} of various yeast 60 <b>S</b> ribosomal subunit <b>assembly</b> intermediates {{has been studied}} in detail, {{little is known about}} ribosomal RNA (rRNA) structural rearrangements that take place during early 60 <b>S</b> <b>assembly</b> steps. Using a high-throughput RNA structure probing method, we provide nucleotide resolution insights into rRNA structural rearrangements during nucleolar 60 <b>S</b> <b>assembly.</b> Our results suggest that many rRNA-folding steps, such as folding of 5. 8 S rRNA, occur at a very specific stage of assembly, and propose that downstream nuclear assembly events can only continue once 5. 8 S folding has been completed. Our maps of nucleotide flexibility enable making predictions about the establishment of protein-rRNA interactions, providing intriguing insights into the temporal order of protein-rRNA as well as long-range inter-domain rRNA interactions. These data argue that many distant domains in the rRNA can assemble simultaneously during early 60 <b>S</b> <b>assembly</b> and underscore the enormous complexity of 60 S synthesis. Ribosome biogenesis is a dynamic process that involves the ordered assembly of ribosomal proteins and numerous RNA structural rearrangements. Here the authors apply ChemModSeq, a high-throughput RNA structure probing method, to quantitatively measure changes in RNA flexibility during the nucleolar stages of 60 <b>S</b> <b>assembly</b> in yeast...|$|R

40|$|YqeH, a circularly permuted GTPase, is conserved among {{bacteria}} and eukaryotes including humans. It {{was shown to}} be essential for the assembly of small ribosomal (30 S) subunit in bacteria. However, whether YqeH interacts with 30 S ribosome and how it may participate in 30 <b>S</b> <b>assembly</b> are not known. Here, using co-sedimentation experiments, we report that YqeH co-associates with 30 S ribosome in the GTP-bound form. In order to probe whether YqeH functions as RNA chaperone in 30 <b>S</b> <b>assembly,</b> we assayed for strand dissociation and annealing activity. While YqeH does not exhibit these activities, it binds a non-specific single and double-stranded RNA, which unlike the 30 S binding is independent of GTP/GDP binding and does not affect intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rates. Further, S 5, a ribosomal protein which participates during {{the initial stages of}} 30 <b>S</b> <b>assembly,</b> was found to promote GTP hydrolysis and RNA binding activities of YqeH...|$|R

40|$|SummaryProtein {{degradation}} by the ubiquitin-proteasome {{system is}} central to cell homeostasis and survival. Defects in this process are associated with diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The 26 S proteasome is a large protease complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. Here, we show that ADP-ribosylation promotes 26 S proteasome activity in both Drosophila and human cells. We identify the ADP-ribosyltransferase tankyrase (TNKS) and the 19 <b>S</b> <b>assembly</b> chaperones dp 27 and dS 5 b as direct binding partners of the proteasome regulator PI 31. TNKS-mediated ADP-ribosylation of PI 31 drastically reduces its affinity for 20 S proteasome α subunits to relieve 20 S repression by PI 31. Additionally, PI 31 modification increases binding to and sequestration of dp 27 and dS 5 b from 19 S regulatory particles, promoting 26 <b>S</b> <b>assembly.</b> Inhibition of TNKS by either RNAi or a small-molecule inhibitor, XAV 939, blocks this process to reduce 26 <b>S</b> <b>assembly.</b> These results unravel a mechanism of proteasome regulation that can be targeted with existing small-molecule inhibitors...|$|R
