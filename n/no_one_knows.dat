5|$|Robert realizes his {{daughter}} Caroline {{is a drug}} addict and is caught between his demanding new position and difficult family life. On a visit to Mexico, he is encouraged by Salazar's successful efforts in hurting the Obregón brothers. When he returns to Ohio, Robert learns his efforts to see Caroline rehabilitated have failed. She has run away {{to the city of}} Cincinnati, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> her exact location. She steals from her parents to procure money for drugs.|$|E
5|$|The vehicle starts {{again and}} they leave, but Wes panics {{and tries to}} force Sean {{to turn around and}} go back for Ritch, causing the car to go over a cliff. Calmer, he wants to wait for help, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> where they are because they had told their {{families}} they were going somewhere else. They winch the vehicle back up to the road, but they cannot get it to start.|$|E
5|$|With The Mansion Of Happiness {{published}} from 1800 in England to 1926 in The United States, it is {{the longest}} continuously published board game with a known designer, George Fox. That totals 126 years of continuous publication. Obviously Chess, Draughts (Checkers), Go, and many other board games have been continuously published for a longer time, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> the designer of these games.|$|E

5|$|TK is {{a mysterious}} {{character}} {{who wears a}} large bandanna over his eyes and tends to break out in dance every so often. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> his real name or past. He speaks in semi-nonsensical English phrases depending on the situation, mainly quoted from pop culture, but apparently does not know English fluently. He saves the team many times and does know some Japanese but rarely speaks it. He carries Browning Hi-Power and LAR Grizzly handguns or a PP-19 Bizon submachine gun during missions.|$|E
5|$|Theses 30–34 {{deal with}} the false {{certainty}} Luther believed the indulgence preachers offered Christians. Since <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> whether a person is truly repentant, a letter assuring a person of his forgiveness is dangerous. In theses 35 and 36, he attacks the idea that an indulgence makes repentance unnecessary. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} the truly repentant person, who alone may benefit from the indulgence, has already received the only benefit the indulgence provides. Truly repentant Christians have already, according to Luther, been forgiven of the penalty as well as the guilt of sin. In thesis 37, he states that indulgences are not necessary for Christians to receive all the benefits provided by Christ. Theses 39 and 40 argue that indulgences make true repentance more difficult. True repentance desires God's punishment of sin, but indulgences teach one to avoid punishment, since that is the purpose of purchasing the indulgence.|$|E
5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E

Now, I call that a most important thing to dwell upon. How can you, a scientist, overlook it?" ...|$|R

5|$|Altogether, Diocletian {{effected}} a large {{increase in}} the number of bureaucrats at the government's command; Lactantius was to claim that there were now more men using tax money than there were paying it. The historian Warren Treadgold estimates that under Diocletian the number of men in the civil service doubled from 15,000 to 30,000. The classicist Roger Bagnall estimated that there was one bureaucrat for every 5–10,000 people in Egypt based on 400 or 800 bureaucrats for 4 million inhabitants (<b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> the population of the province in 300 AD; Strabo 300 years earlier put it at 7.5 million, excluding Alexandria). (By comparison, the ratio in 12th-century Song dynasty China was one bureaucrat for every 15,000 people.) Jones estimated 30,000 bureaucrats for an empire of 50–65 million inhabitants, which works out to approximately 1,667 or 2,167 inhabitants per imperial official as averages empire-wide. The actual numbers of officials and ratios per inhabitant varied, of course, per diocese depending on the number of provinces and population within a diocese. Provincial and diocesan paid officials (there were unpaid supernumeraries) numbered about 13–15,000 based on their staff establishments as set by law. The other 50% were with the emperor(s) in his or their comitatus, with the praetorian prefects, with the grain supply officials in the capital (later, the capitals, Rome and Constantinople), Alexandria, and Carthage and officials from the central offices located in the provinces.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> {{for sure}} exactly when to {{discontinue}} treatment, even when recovery occurs quickly, {{it is still}} recommended that both ACE-I and B-B be continued {{for at least one}} year after diagnosis.|$|E

60|$|When she had gone, Lady Valleys rang for her maid again, and relapsed into meditation. Her {{first thought}} was to consult her husband; her second that secrecy was strength. Since <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> but Barbara, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> had better <b>know.</b>|$|R
25|$|In May 2009, {{his film}} <b>No</b> <b>One</b> <b>Knows</b> About Persian Cats won an Un Certain Regard Special Jury Prize ex-aequo when it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. This film chronicles the hardships facing young Iranian musicians seeking to evade censorship.|$|E
25|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> how the powers-that-be {{convinced}} Kubrick {{to direct}} the Apollo landings. Maybe they had compromised Kubrick in some way. The fact that his brother, Raul Kubrick, {{was the head of}} the American Communist Party may have been one of the avenues pursued by the government to get Stanley to cooperate.|$|E
25|$|Detectives {{surrounded}} a {{house near}} Madison and Robey Streets, {{and threw a}} dragnet over the southwestern side of town for a former boarder in the Paroubek home. They continued {{to search for the}} anonymous writer of the nasty letters received by Frank Paroubek. Apparently neither the boarder, the writer, or the unknown man who had spoken to Frank were ever found. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> what really happened to Elsie Paroubek.|$|E

25|$|Monday night games {{early in}} the season are often highly {{anticipated}} since records are new, teams usually are showcasing fresh talent and potential, and storylines coming into the season are often played out as fans try to see if these hyped teams are up to form. Since <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> during the first month of the season if a team is indeed good, or will rebound from a difficult start, interest is usually high for the first few weeks of the MNF season.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{humans who}} catch a humanized {{influenza}} A virus (a human flu virus of type A) usually have symptoms that include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, conjunctivitis, and, in severe cases, breathing problems and pneumonia {{that may be}} fatal. The severity of the infection depends {{in large part on}} the state of the infected persons' immune systems and whether they had been exposed to the strain before (in which case they would be partially immune). <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> if these or other symptoms will be the symptoms of a humanized H5N1 flu.|$|E
25|$|The {{rivalry between}} the two new states {{presented}} a dilemma of {{which was to be}} admitted first. Harrison directed Secretary of State James G. Blaine to shuffle the papers and obscure from him which he was signing first and the actual order went unrecorded, thus <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> which of the Dakotas was admitted first. However, since North Dakota alphabetically appears before South Dakota, its proclamation was published first in the Statutes At Large. Since then, it has become common to list the Dakotas alphabetically and thus North Dakota is usually listed as the 39thstate.|$|E

25|$|In 1520 the caravels began {{delivering}} Spanish cacao to Spain and {{the pirates}} {{with a letter}} of marque from England, perhaps due to ignorance of the new ingredient, burned and discarded {{the contents of the}} Spanish ships which they seized. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> for certain when cocoa first arrived in Spain, however it was considered a valuable material in the mid-16th century. The value which the product had {{can be seen in the}} strength of the Spanish galleons which carried the first cacao seeds to Spanish ports to prevent their theft.|$|E
25|$|On 28 June 1762, {{with the}} aid of her lover Grigory Orlov, Catherine rallied the troops of Saint Petersburg to her support and {{declared}} herself Catherine II, the sovereign ruler of Russia, later naming her son Paul as her heir. She had Peter arrested and forced him to sign an act of abdication. When he sought permission to leave the country, she refused it, intending to hold him prisoner for life. He had only a few days to live, however, as shortly after his arrest, he was strangled to death by Catherine's supporters, though <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> what part Catherine had in Peter's death.|$|E
25|$|Henry Augustus Pilsbry suggested, in 1946, that Orthalicus reses reses {{arrived in}} Florida from Central America and the Caribbean {{shortly after the}} {{emergence}} of the Florida peninsula in the late Pleistocene. Snails that were sealed in place on floating tropical trees may have been cast ashore on the Florida peninsula by high winds and hurricanes. This form of dispersal has been suggested for both Orthalicus and Liguus, but the exact origin of these species is still in question. In 1972, Craig suggested that populations of Orthalicus arrived directly across the Gulf of Mexico from Central America, but the mode of transportation and whether dispersal occurred as a single event or multiple events was not known. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> when Orthalicus reses reses arrived in the Lower Keys.|$|E
