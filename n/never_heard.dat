5|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} problem Biden faced {{was the fact that}} voters did not know about him and his candidacy. An April 2–5 poll {{conducted}} by Gallup found that 38% of the public had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Joe Biden and 17% had no opinion at all about him. In contrast, 0% of the public had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Hillary Clinton and only 3% had no opinion according to a June 1–3 poll by Gallup.|$|E

5|$|A September poll {{conducted}} by Clemson University found that 36% {{of the public}} had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Joe Biden and only 44% had a favorable opinion of him. However, this was the highest awareness rating in the Democratic field outside of the frontrunners (Clinton, Obama, and Edwards) and non-declared but highly discussed Al Gore. A September 18 poll found that 56% of respondents had not heard enough about Biden to form an opinion about him.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} tower collapsed, FDNY commanders issued {{evacuation}} warnings. Due to technical difficulties with malfunctioning radio repeater systems, many firefighters <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> the evacuation orders. 9-1-1 dispatchers also received information from callers {{that was not}} passed along to commanders on the scene. Within hours of the attack, a substantial {{search and rescue operation}} was launched. After months of around-the-clock operations, the World Trade Center site was cleared by the end of May 2002.|$|E
5|$|Ayers Rock {{were formed}} in the Australian pop-music scene of the early 1970s, which {{included}} artists {{in a number of}} genres: mainstream pop (Zoot and Liv Maessen), blues rock (Chain), heavy rock (Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs), and boogie (Carson). Bands such as Blackfeather and Madder Lake combined mainstream and progressive rock. Most pop and rock listeners had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> jazz fusion; when Ayers Rock incorporated the music into their sets, it was rarely performed by fellow Australian artists.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, it was {{sometimes}} {{claimed that the}} original letter could be found on display at Brasenose College at the University of Oxford along with other great works in the English language.

Peter only knows what is happening when reading the episode's plot synopsis in TV Guide (the reason he entered the rodeo), and finds out who Luke is. As Luke escapes out the window, Peter alerts Joe, who apprehends Luke. Joe also arrests Meg for harboring a fugitive, and she is sent to prison. Luke is <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> from again in the episode.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{and some}} of his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda. An {{expedition}} was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the Prince and had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of King George II either. Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E
5|$|Another elite unit {{would be}} the Black Guard, a 25-man guerrilla unit under a certain Lieutenant García. García, one of Luna's favorites, was a modest but brave soldier. His unit was tasked to {{approach}} the enemy by surprise and quickly return to camp. Luna had admired García's unit very much {{that he wanted to}} increase their size. However, García declined the offer. He believed that a larger force might undermine the efficiency of their work. Jose Alejandrino, the chief army engineer and one of Luna's aides, stated that he <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of García and his unit again after Luna's resignation on February 28.|$|E

5|$|During World War II Russell Spurr was a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Indian Navy fighting the Japanese in Burma. After the war, in February 1946, Spurr {{was part of the}} Commonwealth occupation force stationed in the Japanese naval base of Kure in southern Japan. There he noticed a huge drydock standing empty, and after querying what it had been used for, he learnt that it was where Yamato had been built. Spurr had been isolated in Burma for several years and had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Yamato, but he became interested in her story and started collecting information about the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Gertrude was {{released}} from police custody shortly after the incident. She was sent to Chicago with $7 and was <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> from again. The hydrochloric acid that Carlton ingested failed to kill him, but did badly burn his esophagus, which {{made it difficult for}} him to ingest food. Carlton was indicted on August 16 and was charged with the murder of Mamah Borthwick, the only death that was directly witnessed by a survivor. Carlton entered a not guilty plea. Forty-seven days after the fire, before the case could be heard, Carlton died of starvation in his cell.|$|E
5|$|Hearings began September 27, 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen {{witnesses}} testified. Many were agents of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, controversially and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy of guilt by association. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom they had <b>never</b> <b>heard.</b>|$|E
