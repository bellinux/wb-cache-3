5|$|When Gilda was {{forecast}} to move near southeastern Florida, gale warnings {{were issued}} from North Key Largo to Fort Lauderdale. Rough seas affected the Florida coastline for about 72hours, causing moderate coastal property damage and beach erosion. After becoming a large subtropical cyclone, gale warnings were issued {{at various times}} from Cape Hatteras, <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>to</b> {{the mouth of the}} Merrimack River in Massachusetts. High surf and minor beach erosion were reported along the coastline, and gale force winds were observed from <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>to</b> New Jersey. Over the western Atlantic Ocean, the storm produced strong winds and rough seas. One ship reported a wave height of 28ft (8.5m), though no significant marine losses were reported. Around the time of it becoming extratropical, Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia recorded a wind gust of 74mph (119km/h).|$|E
5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over New England {{resulted in the}} possibility that Edouard would track {{to the west and}} strike the United States. One computer model predicted the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City, New Jersey with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) on Labor Day. This caused Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist weekend of the year, though an evacuation never occurred. Due to the possibility for a landfall on the East Coast of the United States, officials at the National Hurricane Center issued Tropical Storm and Hurricane Watches and Warnings from Cape Lookout, <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>to</b> Eastport, Maine at various times. Tropical storm warnings existed from <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>to</b> Watch Hill, Rhode Island and {{from the mouth of the}} Merrimack River to the United States/Canada border, while hurricane warnings existed from Watch Hill, Rhode Island to Merrimack River, Massachusetts.
