5|$|Lloyd George did however {{win some}} loyalty from Keynes with his actions at the Paris conference by {{intervening}} against the French {{to ensure the}} dispatch of much-needed food supplies to German civilians. Clemenceau also pushed for substantial reparations, though <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as those proposed by the British, while on security grounds, France argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain.|$|E
5|$|Panzer Dragoon {{received}} positive reviews, both in 1995 and in retrospective coverage. Though {{sales were}} <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as Sega expected, possibly {{due to the}} success of Sony's PlayStation console over the Saturn, they were substantial enough for Sega to allow the series to continue with the 1996 prequel Panzer Dragoon II Zwei, also released on the Saturn.|$|E
5|$|The Blackdowns {{are on the}} {{south-west}} {{border of}} Somerset, extending into Devon. They are composed of Upper Greensand. The scarp faces north and is steep and wooded, with a south facing dip slope. There is an open plateau, which is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as the Mendips.|$|E

5|$|Viewing {{figures for}} season seven were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as {{previous}} seasons; by the twelfth episode, figures {{were down to}} 314,000 viewers, a 46% decrease from the season premiere which was watched by 585,000 viewers. Despite the decrease in viewers, however, reviews for the season were of praise, rather than criticism.|$|E
5|$|During Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, {{parts and}} {{remnants}} of the storm reached Presque Isle. The park was closed in preparation of the storm and waves for 14 – 18 feet were called for, along with high winds. The storm {{was expected to be}} severe, but luckily was not. Only 8 foot waves were recorded and <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> of winds either. The park made it out with only minor flooding, a few downed trees, and the loss of power at the park marina.|$|E
5|$|Pollution was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> in New Jersey or Connecticut as in New York, but it {{was still}} significant. New Jersey {{reported}} its worst-ever smog. Elizabeth, New Jersey had smog at half the levels of New York City. A Connecticut health official reported air pollution four times higher than average; Greenwich, Connecticut was minimally impacted. The nearby New York counties of Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester reported very little smog. Although not part of the area covered by the alert, unusually high smog was reported as far as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Boston, Massachusetts, whose mayor issued a similar health warning.|$|E

5|$|Saturn's {{interior}} is probably {{composed of a}} core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core {{is surrounded by a}} deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach , higher than on Jupiter, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as those on Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{began the}} 2001 season having gone 111 the {{previous}} season, {{ending with a}} 4120 victory in the 2001 Gator Bowl against Clemson. Fans' hopes for the new season were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as the previous year, however. Star quarterback Michael Vick was selected with the first pick in the 2001 NFL Draft, and there were questions about how well the team would cope {{with the loss of}} Vick and several other important players. Despite those fears, the Hokies began the 2001 season ranked No. 9 in the coaches' poll and were picked in the annual poll of media covering the Big East to finish second in that conference.|$|E
25|$|New Line Cinema {{released}} a film adaptation, titled The Golden Compass, on 7 December 2007. Directed by Chris Weitz, the production had a mixed reception, and though worldwide sales were strong, its U.S. earnings were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as the studio had hoped.|$|E

Unfortunately, the profits were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as William expected and they started having financial difficulties. William's anxiety over them was probably what caused his first nervous breakdown.|$|E
25|$|Higher-speed rail {{services}} are intercity rail services that have top speeds higher than conventional intercity trains but the speeds are <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> {{as those in}} the high-speed rail services. These {{services are}} provided after improvements to the conventional rail infrastructure in order to support trains that can operate safely at higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, men's shoes {{continued}} to have a squared toe, but the heels were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high.</b> From 1720-1730, the heels became even smaller, and the shoes became more comfortable, no longer containing a block toe. The shoes from {{the first half of}} the century often contained an oblong buckle usually embedded with stones.|$|E

50|$|One {{drawback}} of the Clerici {{solution is}} its high toxicity and corrosiveness. Today sodium polytungstate {{has been introduced}} as a replacement, but its solutions will <b>not</b> reach <b>as</b> <b>high</b> in density <b>as</b> the Clerici solution.|$|R
25|$|From 1862 the Brisbane River {{has been}} dredged for {{navigation}} purposes. Throughout {{much of the}} 20th century large quantities of sand and gravel were extracted from the estuary of the river. Since the rate of materials being deposited is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as that which was removed, the river has acted as a subaqueous mine.|$|E
25|$|The storage {{capacity}} of synaptic-based memory storage systems is very large, {{making it an}} attractive mechanism to study. There are approximately 104 synapses per neuron and 1011 neurons in the human brain. Nonsynaptic plasticity is often overlooked simply because its {{storage capacity}} is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high.</b> Regulating the density of ion channels in the axon and soma of a neuron would change the throughput and affect all of the synapses. Therefore, its storage capacity would be significantly {{less than that of}} synaptic plasticity.|$|E
25|$|The band gained {{critical}} {{praise and}} the attention of major record labels {{after the release of}} their 1992 album , leading to a recording contract with Interscope Records. They experienced a surge of popularity with the release of the albums Scream, Dracula, Scream! (1995) and RFTC (1998), accompanied by numerous vinyl singles and EPs released on independent labels. However, album sales were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as expected and Interscope soon turned their attention to higher-grossing acts. The band left the label, and shortly thereafter drummer Atom Willard departed the group.|$|E
50|$|Six {{months later}} fellow soul singer Percy Sledge {{included}} {{his version of}} the song on his 1967 album The Percy Sledge Way, but it did <b>not</b> chart <b>as</b> <b>high,</b> <b>as</b> it had a similar sound to Carr's unmistakable vocals.|$|R

25|$|Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip {{were under}} the local command of Brigadier General Johnson K. Duncan. The average quality of the {{soldiers}} in the garrison was probably <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as Lovell and Duncan would have liked; the most militant had been drawn off for other fields, leaving the irresolute and the unfit. Because New Orleans was something of an international city, the ranks contained {{a greater proportion of}} foreign-born soldiers than most units of the Confederate Army. Nevertheless, they could be expected to perform their duty, even if they would not make extraordinary exertions.|$|E
25|$|The {{turn of the}} {{millennium}} introduced digital television to Australia, {{as well as the}} transition to widescreen standard-definition and high-definition television production. Community stations also began to receive permanent transmitter licences, replacing temporary licences that were renewed yearly. At this time it was thought that allowing Commercial Multicasting would be detrimental so the publicly owned networks (ABC and SBS) were the only networks that were allowed to create new digital SD Channels. This was only revised after Digital Television Uptake was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as expected in many areas, and from 1 January 2009, Network Ten, Nine and Seven were allowed to create alternative SD channels.|$|E
25|$|Highways, on {{the other}} hand, {{complement}} the national network of expressways and federal roads and built under the JKR R5 rural highway standard, with relatively high design speed limit (although <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as the expressway speed limit) of 100km/h, allowing the maximum speed limit of 90km/h. The highways are built with partial access control, and grade-spearated interchanges and at-grade crossings are both permitted. However, {{it is possible for}} a federal or state highway to be built with almost equivalent standard of an expressway with the exception of lower speed limit, for example the Federal Highway. Highways can be built either as dual-carriageway or two-lane single carriageway.|$|E
