25|$|Demand {{for tickets}} {{at the new}} stadium easily outstripped supply, <b>not</b> <b>coincidentally</b> after the arrival of coach Vince Lombardi in 1959. In 1961, four years after it opened, the stadium's {{capacity}} was increased to 38,669.|$|E
25|$|The 1968 {{discovery}} of oil at Prudhoe Bay and the 1977 {{completion of the}} Trans-Alaska Pipeline System led to an oil boom. Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, <b>not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> Alaska repealed its state income tax.|$|E
5000|$|... 20 April: In a statement, Muqtada al-Sadr {{warned that}} he would declare [...] "open war" [...] if the {{campaign}} against him did <b>not</b> stop. <b>Coincidentally,</b> Al-Qaeda in Iraq released a similar message the same day, calling for a 30-day period of violence.|$|R
5000|$|Like the film, {{the song}} was written as an homage to and a self-parody of past Disney works, {{specifically}} such big production numbers as [...] "Under the Sea" [...] from The Little Mermaid and [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] from Beauty and the Beast, both of which, <b>not</b> so <b>coincidentally,</b> also had music by Alan Menken.|$|R

25|$|In {{the next}} couple of decades, a number of free dailies opened in Colorado. <b>Not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> most were started by University of Colorado graduates. Free dailies opened in Aspen (1979, 1988), Vail (1981), Breckenridge (1990), Glenwood Springs (1990); Grand Junction (1995); Steamboat Springs (1990); and Telluride (1991).|$|E
25|$|That October, {{it emerged}} {{in the form of}} a new company called the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway, a name which {{accurately}} reflected the physical reality of its route structure. One of the forces at work in the reorganization which engendered the BR was a Rochester coal merchant named Arthur Yates. <b>Not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> Yates was the line's biggest coal shipper.|$|E
25|$|Milwaukee {{went wild}} over the Braves, who were welcomed as genuine heroes. The Braves {{finished}} 92–62 {{in their first}} season in Milwaukee, and drew a then-NL record 1.8million fans. The success of the team was noted by many owners. <b>Not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> the Philadelphia Athletics, St. Louis Browns, Brooklyn Dodgers, and New York Giants would leave their original hometowns {{within the next five}} years.|$|E
25|$|The {{day shift}} ended, {{and the night}} shift started with 62 men running Piper Alpha. As he found the on-duty {{custodian}} busy, the engineer neglected to inform him of the condition of Pump A. Instead he placed the permit in the control centre and left. This permit disappeared and was <b>not</b> found. <b>Coincidentally</b> there was another permit issued for the general overhaul of Pump A {{that had not yet}} begun.|$|R

25|$|Since {{that time}} the city has seen rapid growth along its prime {{commercial}} corridor, West Broad Street. This occurred, perhaps <b>not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> after the city rebuilt and replanted the street {{to make it more}} appealing. The reconstruction reestablished shade trees {{along the length of the}} street and added street furniture and landscaping, in addition to placing utility lines underground. The sharp economic recession of the late-2000s brought most development to a halt.|$|E
25|$|The dissidents {{escalated}} matters {{further by}} issuing a factional bulletin devoted to {{attacks on the}} party leadership, sent out to the entire party mailing list — an action which further enraged DeLeon and his associates. Things went downhill from there, with fist fights and a full out brawl capping the summer of factional sniping, as both dissidents and regulars claimed for themselves the mantle of the party, its ballot line, and, <b>not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> the party's assets.|$|E
25|$|In years past, Florida would {{occasionally}} schedule a home game in Jacksonville, Tampa, or (less frequently) Miami and Orlando. But besides {{the annual meeting}} with Georgia, the Gators have not played a regular season home contest anywhere besides Florida Field since September 1980, when they defeated the California Golden Bears in old Tampa Stadium. <b>Not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> this game was played the season prior to Florida Field's south endzone expansion, which made it the largest football stadium in Florida.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{copies of}} the album cover contain a red and yellow {{rectangle}} spoofing the Parental Advisory seal, reading [...] "Rental Advisory: Freedom <b>Not</b> for Purchase". <b>Coincidentally,</b> {{it was the first}} Queens of the Stone Age album since Rated R to not bear a genuine Parental Advisory seal.|$|R
50|$|Purvis' mental {{stability}} {{was always}} in question, and he attempted suicide on several occasions. Although he was a brilliant musician, capable of either a hot jazz solo or a difficult passage through the hardest of arrangements, {{he could not be}} counted on to arrive anywhere on time. This lack of accountability plagued him throughout his life, and can be traced to his earliest years. In many instances, once Jack Purvis showed up to play an extended engagement, <b>not</b> so <b>coincidentally,</b> there was a spike in petty thefts and burgalaries for the vicinity of that gig.|$|R
5000|$|The CPU-powered 28.8 kbps {{software}} modem cartridge {{was developed in}} partnership between Nexus Telocation Systems, Ltd. and Surf Technology. It is housed on a special cartridge with a port for the included modular cable, which then connects to the network. [...] It is the Nintendo 64's only official Internet connectivity product, because the early discussions between Surf and Nintendo to have built one directly into the console did <b>not</b> materialize. <b>Coincidentally,</b> an unlicensed third party alternative was produced by InterAct for America {{in the form of}} the SharkWire Online system.|$|R
25|$|Other {{than the}} two orders with direct flight muscles, all other living winged insects fly using a {{different}} mechanism, involving indirect flight muscles. This mechanism evolved once, and is the defining feature (synapomorphy) for the infraclass Neoptera; it corresponds, probably <b>not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> {{with the appearance of}} a wing-folding mechanism, which allows Neopteran insects to fold the wings back over the abdomen when at rest (though this ability has been lost secondarily in some groups, such as in the butterflies).|$|E
25|$|The {{animated}} {{television series}} SpongeBob SquarePants primarily {{takes place in}} the city of Bikini Bottom, which is frequently considered to be located beneath Bikini Atoll. Voice actor Tom Kenny, who portrays the series' main character, confirmed that the fictitious city was named after Bikini Atoll, but denied a fan theory that the series' characters held any relation to the real-life nuclear testing that occurred in the atoll. Also, <b>not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> is shown in the theme song and in other parts of episodes like The Season 9 episode, Lame and Fortune.|$|E
25|$|To {{produce a}} shock wave, {{an object in}} a given medium (such as air or water) must travel faster than the local speed of sound. In {{the case of an}} {{aircraft}} travelling at high subsonic speed, regions of air around the aircraft may be travelling at exactly the speed of sound, so that the sound waves leaving the aircraft pile up on one another, similar to a traffic jam on a motorway. When a shock wave forms, the local air pressure increases and then spreads out sideways. Because of this amplification effect, a shock wave can be very intense, more like an explosion when heard at a distance (<b>not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> since explosions create shock waves).|$|E
25|$|Howard {{accepted}} {{no personal}} {{blame for the}} fiasco at Chancellorsville, and in his autobiography suggests that {{he thought it was}} entirely his corps's fault for running, <b>not</b> his.

50|$|The coastal {{neighborhood}} is mainly dense residential, with large condominium buildings {{along the beach}} and smaller condominiums, apartment buildings, and single family residences as one moves inland. A public beach is within short walking distance of all residences with some buildings having direct access. The beach includes the Long Beach bicycle path that starts at Shoreline Village and ends in the Belmont Shore neighborhood of Long Beach. Beginning in 2009 bike lanes were added to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd St. {{as part of the}} Long Beach's citywide effort to become more bicycle friendly. Perhaps <b>not</b> so <b>coincidentally</b> more bicycle shops have since opened around the area.|$|R
25|$|Troelstra was {{the member}} of {{parliament}} for the district of Leeuwarden, close to the men's village of Beetgum, and was drawn into the case after the brother's conviction. He collected additional evidence, which he published in socialist newspapers. One of his revelations was that soon after the burglary, three men had quickly emigrated to America and Germany. However, Troelstra did not manage to get the case retried. The affair gained fame, particularly in socialist circles, as the Dutch pendant of the French Dreyfus Affair, and Troelstra's role was, perhaps <b>not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> not unlike that played by Émile Zola. Despite the failure of his efforts (the brothers served most of their sentence), they contributed to Troelstra's reputation and goodwill in the Frisian countryside.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{archaeology}} {{provides the}} only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people {{have come and gone}} of which {{there is little or no}} written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, Homo sapiens has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of Homo for millions of years (see Human evolution). These civilizations are, <b>not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization – the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities – must come from archaeology.|$|E
25|$|Bode {{designed}} the velocity computing networks of Director T-15 by applying a {{finite difference method}} instead of differentiation. Under this scheme the target positional coordinates were stored in a mechanical memory, usually a potentiometer or a cam. The velocity was then calculated by taking {{the difference between the}} coordinates of the current position and the coordinates of the previous reading that were stored in memory and dividing by the difference of their respective times. This method was more robust than the differentiation method and it also smoothed out signal disturbances since the finite time-step size was less sensitive to random signal impulses (spikes). It also introduced for the first time an algorithm better suited to modern digital signal processing theory rather than to the classical Calculus-based analog signal processing approach that was followed then. <b>Not</b> <b>coincidentally</b> it {{is an integral part of}} modern digital control theory and digital signal processing and it is known as the backward difference algorithm. In addition the Director T-15 operated only in rectangular coordinates thus eliminating coordinate transformation-based errors. These design innovations paid performance dividends and the Director T-15 was twice as accurate as its predecessor and it converged on a target twice as fast.|$|E
5000|$|In I Never Played the Game, Cosell popularized {{the word}} [...] "jockocracy" [...] {{originally}} coined by author Robert Lipsyte, describing how athletes were given announcing jobs {{that they had}} <b>not</b> earned. <b>Coincidentally,</b> he was replaced for the 1985 World Series broadcast by Tim McCarver, himself a former baseball player, to join Al Michaels and Jim Palmer. (The {{title of the book}} is a double entendre, meaning that Cosell never actually played the game of football or any other professional sport he broadcast as well as implying that he never played the [...] "game" [...] of corporate politics.) Cosell is notably absent from the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|R
50|$|Escoffier {{spent nearly}} {{seven years in}} the army - at first {{stationed}} in various barracks throughout France (including five months in Villefranche-sur-Mer, <b>coincidentally</b> <b>not</b> three miles from his old home in Nice), and later at Metz as chef de cuisine of the Rhine Army after {{the outbreak of the}} Franco-Prussian War in 1870. His army experiences led him to study the technique of canning food.|$|R
50|$|With Lofthouse firmly ensconced as England centre {{forward and}} with {{competition}} {{from the likes of}} Jackie Milburn, Stan Mortensen and Ronnie Allen, it is perhaps not too surprising that his only representative honour was as reserve for a 'B' international against West Germany in March 1954. At this time Huddersfield were {{near the top of the}} First Division (something they have <b>not</b> repeated since). <b>Coincidentally</b> both Milburn and Mortensen had guested for Huddersfield during the war.|$|R
25|$|Following his MVP season, Lisch {{received}} increased physical {{attention from}} defenders {{and became an}} obvious target for opposition defences. However, he remained among the league's top ten scorers; the extra defensive attention also created more scoring opportunities for teammates like Matt Knight. Over {{the first half of}} the 2012–13 season, Lisch was named Player of the Week for Round 8 and earned selection to the South All-Stars team as the starting shooting guard for the 2012 NBL All-Star Game. However, he was forced to withdraw after being diagnosed with a Grade 2 groin strain. Additionally, against the Townsville Crocodiles on October 14, Lisch played his 100th consecutive NBL game which, <b>not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> was Rob Beveridge's 100th game for the Wildcats as coach. Lisch became the first player since Darryl McDonald 15 years earlier to achieve 100 consecutive games. Over the second half of the season, he set a season high with 26 points against the Cairns Taipans on January 5, and on February 4, he was named to the Perth Wildcats 30th Anniversary All-Star team. Lisch scored in double figures in every game but five during the regular season, helping the Wildcats finish second on the ladder with a 22–6 record. He helped the Wildcats sweep the Wollongong Hawks in the Semi Finals to move on to the 2013 NBL Grand Final series. There the Wildcats once again faced the New Zealand Breakers, only to lose the series in straight sets.|$|E
500|$|The Foundation {{commissioned}} more press adverts, instructing {{readers to}} [...] "Abandon all art now" [...] and then {{inviting them to}} vote for the worst artist of the year. The 1993 Turner Prize was being judged at the same time, and, perhaps <b>not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> both awards had the same shortlist of four artists. The prize being offered by Drummond and Cauty was £40,000 which was double the £20,000 offered for the Turner Prize.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Gyllenhaal starred {{alongside}} Michael Peña in David Ayer's film End of Watch {{about two}} Los Angeles street cops. The film {{was released on}} September 21, 2012 and received positive reviews, with Roger Ebert saying that [...] "End of Watch {{is one of the}} best police movies in recent years, a virtuoso fusion of performances and often startling action", and Salon.com's Andrew O'Hehir stating that the film was [...] "at least the best cop movie since James Gray's We Own the Night, and very likely since Antoine Fuqua's memorable Training Day (which, <b>not</b> <b>coincidentally,</b> was written by Ayer)". To train for the role, Gyllenhaal took tactical training and participated in actual police drives with co-star Michael Peña to help establish the language of the characters.|$|E

40|$|Aromatic {{amino acid}} hydroxylase (AAAH) genes and insulin-like genes {{form part of}} an {{extensive}} paralogy region shared by human chromosomes 11 and 12, thought to have arisen by tetraploidy in early vertebrate evolution. Cloning of a complementary DNA (cDNA) for an amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) hydroxylase gene (AmphiPAH) allowed us to investigate the ancestry of the human chromosome 11 / 12 paralogy region. Molecular phylogenetic evidence reveals that AmphiPAH is orthologous to vertebrate phenylalanine (PAH) genes; {{the implication is that}} all three vertebrate AAAH genes arose early in metazoan evolution, predating vertebrates. In contrast, our phylogenetic analysis of amphioxus and vertebrate insulin-related gene sequences is consistent with duplication of these genes during early chordate ancestry. The conclusion is that two tightly linked gene families on human chromosomes 11 and 12 were <b>not</b> duplicated <b>coincidentally.</b> We rationalize this paradox by invoking gene loss in the AAAH gene family and conclude that paralogous genes shared by paralogous chromosomes need not have identical evolutionary histories...|$|R
50|$|On July 18, 1903, {{running off}} Marrowstone Point in a fog, North Pacific went off course and struck a rock. The tug C.B.
