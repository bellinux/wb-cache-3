5|$|A <b>National</b> <b>Anthem</b> Committee {{was formed}} in 1948, but it had {{difficulty}} finding suitable music and lyrics. The impending state visit of the Shah of Iran in 1950, resulted in the hasty adoption of a three stanza composition by Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla. Initially it was performed without lyrics for the Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan on August 10, 1950 and was approved for playing during the visit of the Shah. However, the anthem was not officially adopted until August 1954. The <b>National</b> <b>Anthem</b> Committee eventually approved lyrics written by Abu-Al-Asar Hafeez Jullandhuri and the new <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> was first played properly on Radio Pakistan on August 13, 1954. Official approval was announced by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on August 16, 1954 followed by a performance of the <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> in 1955 involving eleven major singers of Pakistan including Ahmad Rushdi.|$|E
5|$|Before the game, Cirque du Soleil, Romero Britto and Little Louie Vega {{performed}} as the pre-game act, and Billy Joel sang the <b>National</b> <b>Anthem,</b> accompanying himself on piano. He also performed at Super Bowl XXIII, which was {{played at the}} same venue. Joel became the second person to sing the <b>National</b> <b>Anthem</b> twice for a Super Bowl; Aaron Neville sang the <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> before Super Bowl XXIV, in New Orleans, and Super Bowl XL (along with Aretha Franklin), in Detroit. This was also the last time until Luke Bryan sang at Super Bowl LI that a male artist had sung the <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> at a Super Bowl.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore {{primary schools}} at lower levels, lessons {{relating}} to the <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> and the singing of the <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> are carried out {{as part of the}} civics and moral education programme. The <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> is sung in all mainstream schools and armed forces camps at ceremonies held at the beginning and/or the end of each day, during which the national flag is also raised and lowered and the Singapore National Pledge is taken. Both the anthem and the national pledge must not be used for commercial situations.|$|E
50|$|Tunes in triple metre {{tend to be}} more lyrical {{and less}} martial than those in duple metre. Consequently, for example, triple metre is rare in <b>national</b> <b>anthems</b> - the <b>national</b> <b>anthems</b> of the United Kingdom and United States being two notable exceptions.|$|R

5|$|National anthems {{are usually}} {{written in the}} most common {{language}} of the state, whether de facto or official. States with multiple national languages may offer several versions of their anthem. For instance, Switzerland's <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> has different lyrics {{for each of the}} country's four official languages: French, German, Italian, and Romansh. The New Zealand <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> is commonly now sung with the first verse in Māori ("Aotearoa") and the second in English ("God Defend New Zealand"). The tune is the same but the lyrics have different meanings. South Africa's <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> is unique in that five of the eleven official languages are used in the same anthem, in which each language comprises a stanza.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, Singapore {{attained}} self-government and the City Council was dissolved. The Government {{felt that}} a <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> was needed to unite the different races in Singapore.

At Toh's request, Zubir modified the lyrics and melody, and the revised song {{was adopted by the}} Legislative Assembly on 11 November 1959. On 30 November, the Singapore State Arms and Flag and <b>National</b> <b>Anthem</b> Ordinance 1959 was passed to regulate the use and display of these national emblems.|$|E
5|$|The Originals' Test against Wales {{is still}} {{considered}} one of sport's great matches. The Test was played at Cardiff Arms Park, 16 December 1905 in front of 47,000 spectators.

Once they had applauded their haka, the crowd, led by 'Teddy' Morgan, sang the Welsh <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land of My Fathers). The match was reportedly the first time a <b>national</b> <b>anthem</b> had been sung before a sporting fixture.|$|E
