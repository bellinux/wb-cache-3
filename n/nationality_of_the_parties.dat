5000|$|Marriage law and {{practice}} in Scotland differs from that in England and Wales. Historically, it was always considered legal and binding for a couple to marry by making public promises, without a formal ceremony but this form has not been available since 1940. More recently [...] "marriage by cohabitation with repute" [...] has also been abolished for any relationship commenced since 2006. Church marriages [...] "without proclamation" [...] are somewhat analogous to the English [...] "marriages by licence", although the permission to perform them is not a church matter. Religious marriages in Scotland {{have never had a}} restriction on the place in which they are performed. Marriages in Scotland normally require between 2 and 6 weeks’ notice to the district registrar depending on the previous marital status and other procedural matters usually involving the country of residence and the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties.</b> Marriages with less than the normal amount of notice require the permission of the Registrar General.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "traditional approach" [...] {{looks to}} {{territorial}} factors, e.g. the domicile or <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties,</b> where the components comprising each {{cause of action}} occurred, where any relevant assets, whether movable or immovable, are located, etc., and chooses the law or laws that have the greatest connection to the cause(s) of action. Even though {{this is a very}} flexible system, there has been some reluctance to apply it and various [...] "escape devices" [...] have developed, which allow courts to apply their local laws (the lex fori) even though the disputed events took place in a different jurisdiction. The parties themselves may plead the case either to avoid invoking a foreign law or agree to the choice of law, assuming that the judge will not {{of his or her own}} motion go behind the pleadings. Their motive will be pragmatic. Full-scale conflict cases take longer and cost more to litigate. However, the courts in some states are predisposed to prefer the lex fori wherever possible. This may reflect the belief that the interests of justice will be better served if the judges apply the law with which they are most familiar, or it may reflect a more general parochialism in systems not accustomed to considering extraterritorial principles of law. One of the most common judicial strategies is to skew the characterization process. By determining that a claim is one involving a contract instead of tort, or a question of family law instead of a testamentary issue, the Court can change the choice of law rules. For example, if an employee is hired by an employer in State A, is injured due to the employer's negligence in State B, and files a lawsuit to recover for the injury in State A, the court in State A might look to the employment contract to see if it contained a clause that governed the employer's duty of care with respect to the employee. If so, the court may be able characterize the claim as a breach of the contract, instead of a tort, and apply the law of the State A either because it was the place where the contract was made (the lex loci contractus) or, if it were the place where the wage or salary was to be paid, where the contract was intended to be performed (the lex loci solutionis).|$|E
40|$|Due to <b>the</b> plethora <b>of</b> {{international}} {{elements of}} a contract to arbitrate, i. e. <b>nationalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parties,</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transaction and <b>the</b> legal background <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arbitrator, questions <b>of</b> law applicable to <b>the</b> substance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dispute are always at stake. In <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> arbitral proceedings, issues of law applicable to the arbitral dispute are raised after a concise examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law applicable to the arbitration agreement, namely whether <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> have consented to arbitrate the subject-matter in issue and the law applicable to the arbitral procedure. The present study draws upon <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>party</b> autonomy, in both theoretical and practical aspects in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freedom <b>of</b> contract principle. It further considers <b>the</b> restrictive role <b>of</b> mandatory rules upon the above principle. Light shall also be shed on <b>the</b> current trends <b>of</b> international mandatory rules and public policy as discussed in ICC awards by experienced arbitrators and solely developed within <b>the</b> ambit <b>of</b> international commercial arbitration. Furthermore, a consistent examination of possible choices of law and rules of law such as a-national rules i. e. lex mercatoria and general trade usages will sketch <b>the</b> existing variety <b>of</b> possibilities in choice of law both on <b>the</b> <b>parties</b> and lawyers leading arbitrations. The last Section will independently examine an absence of choice of law, and several doctrines which envisaged <b>the</b> stance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three distinguished European arbitral systems: English, Swiss and French. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{case was}} {{presided over by}} ICJ Vice-President Judge Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, {{alongside}} 13 other judges and two ad hoc judges appointed by the two countries. The judges were Raymond Ranjeva from Madagascar, Shi Jiuyong from <b>the</b> People's Republic <b>of</b> China, Abdul G.

50|$|Beginning in the 1930s, Moscow {{kept the}} {{republic}} under firm control. <b>The</b> <b>nationalities</b> policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Communist <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union (CPSU) fostered <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a Turkmen political elite and promoted Russification. Slavs, both in Moscow and Turkmenia, closely supervised <b>the</b> national cadre <b>of</b> {{government officials and}} bureaucrats; generally, the Turkmen leadership staunchly supported Soviet policies. Moscow initiated nearly all political activity in the republic, and, except for a corruption scandal in the mid-1980s that ousted longtime First Secretary Muhammetnazar Gapurow, Turkmenistan remained a quiet Soviet republic. Foreigners and even most Soviet citizens couldn't visit the area. Most Turkmen couldn't leave the republic either. Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika {{did not have a}} significant impact on Turkmenistan, as many people there were self-dependent, and settlers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territory and the Soviet Union's ministers rarely intertwined. The republic found itself rather unprepared for <b>the</b> dissolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union and the independence that followed in 1991.|$|R
40|$|Article 25 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ICSID Convention limits <b>the</b> {{jurisdiction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Centre {{to legal}} disputes arising {{directly out of}} an investment between a contracting state and a ‘national’ of another contracting state. Treaty protection, that is, is conditioned by <b>the</b> recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘foreign’ nature <b>of</b> an investment, by way of either a place of incorporation or a control test. In practice, arbitrators recently had to elaborate on <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> ‘nationality’ and to establish what constitutes a ‘foreign’ investment.

Ukraine and TSA Spectrum v. Argentina Republic as well as the differences in BIT provisions explaining the tribunals’ respective findings. Two questions are also considered.
