5000|$|The DuPont formula, {{also known}} as the {{strategic}} profit model, is a common way to break down ROE into three important components. Essentially, ROE will equal the <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> <b>margin</b> multiplied by asset turnover multiplied by financial leverage. Splitting return on equity into three parts makes it easier to understand changes in ROE over time. For example, if the net margin increases, every sale brings in more money, resulting in a higher overall ROE. Similarly, if the asset turnover increases, the firm generates more sales for every unit of assets owned, again resulting in a higher overall ROE. Finally, increasing financial leverage means that the firm uses more debt financing relative to equity financing. Interest payments to creditors are tax deductible, but dividend payments to shareholders are not. Thus, a higher proportion of debt in the firm's capital structure leads to higher ROE. [...] Financial leverage benefits diminish as the risk of defaulting on interest payments increases. So if the firm takes on too much debt, the cost of debt rises as creditors demand a higher risk premium, and ROE decreases. Increased debt will make a positive contribution to a firm's ROE only if the matching Return on assets (ROA) of that debt exceeds the interest rate on the debt.|$|E

A preliminary study shortly after the discovery of the deposit examines the market conditions such as the supply and demand of the mineral, the amount of ore needed to be moved to recover a certain quantity of that mineral as well as analysis of the cost associated with the operation. This pre-feasibility study determines whether the mining project is likely to be profitable; if it is then a more in-depth analysis of the deposit is undertaken. After the full extent of the ore body is known and has been examined by engineers, the feasibility study examines the cost of initial capital investment, methods of extraction, the cost of operation, an estimated length of time to payback, the gross revenue and <b>net</b> <b>profit</b> <b>margin,</b> any possible resale price of the land, the total life of the reserve, the total value of the reserve, investment in future projects, and the property owner or owners' contract. In addition, environmental impact, reclamation, possible legal ramifications and all government permitting are considered. These steps of analysis determine whether the mine company should proceed with the extraction of the minerals or whether the project should be abandoned. The mining company may decide to sell the rights to the reserve to a third party rather than develop it themselves, or the decision to proceed with extraction may be postponed indefinitely until market conditions become favorable.|$|E

Previous literature has found the risk sharing benefit associated with financial market liberalisation. With the increased number of participants in market would increase the chance of successful trades. Previous studies have found that there is a positive correlation with financial market liberalisation and market liquidity. Exchange controls have been put in place to prevent capital flight in sudden economic down turns.

A purposive sampling technique was used in this study and a sample of 28 dual listed companies was selected. The approach to this study was an explanatory approach and the research paradigm was archival. The statistical tools which were utilised in the study were broken into two components, namely, the descriptive statistics and the inferential statistics.
