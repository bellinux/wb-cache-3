While performing the study, Saffir realized there was <b>no</b> <b>simple</b> scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane. Mirroring {{the utility of the}} Richter magnitude scale in describing earthquakes, he devised a 1–5 scale based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures. Saffir gave the scale to the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>simple</b> way of {{differentiating}} a venomous snake from a non-venomous one {{merely by}} using a scale character.

Scale patterns help to indicate the species and from the references, it can be verified if the snake species is known to be venomous or not.|$|E

5|$|A {{nitrogen}} atom {{has seven}} electrons. In the ground state, they {{are arranged in}} the electron configuration 1s2s2p2p2p. It therefore has five valence electrons in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (the p-electrons) are unpaired. It {{has one of the}} highest electronegativities among the elements (3.04 on the Pauling scale), exceeded only by chlorine (3.16), oxygen (3.44), and fluorine (3.98). Following periodic trends, its single-bond covalent radius of 71pm is smaller than those of boron (84pm) and carbon (76pm), while it is larger than those of oxygen (66pm) and fluorine (57pm). The nitride anion, N3−, is much larger at 146pm, similar to that of the oxide (O2−: 140pm) and fluoride (F−: 133pm) anions. The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577MJ·mol−1, and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920MJ·mol−1. Due to these very high figures, nitrogen has <b>no</b> <b>simple</b> cationic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|About {{half the}} {{potential}} prey that hit orb webs escape. A web has to perform three functions: intercepting the prey (intersection), absorbing its momentum without breaking (stopping), and trapping the prey by entangling it or sticking to it (retention). No single design {{is best for}} all prey. For example: wider spacing of lines will increase the web's area and hence its ability to intercept prey, but reduce its stopping power and retention; closer spacing, larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention, but {{would make it easier}} for potential prey to see and avoid the web, at least during the day. However, there are no consistent differences between orb webs built for use during the day and those built for use at night. In fact, there is <b>no</b> <b>simple</b> relationship between orb web design features and the prey they capture, as each orb-weaving species takes a wide range of prey.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is <b>no</b> <b>simple</b> tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E

5|$|The author {{explores the}} {{question}} of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is <b>no</b> <b>simple</b> tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She points out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them.|$|E
