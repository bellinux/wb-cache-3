5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} analysing {{a detailed}} CT {{scan of the}} braincase of the London Archaeopteryx concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan. The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination. The skull scan also revealed the structure of its inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non-avian reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that Archaeopteryx had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception, and coordination needed to fly. Archaeopteryx had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% {{of the way to}} modern birds from the condition of non-coelurosaurian dinosaurs such as Carcharodontosaurus or Allosaurus, which had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and inner ear. Newer research shows that while the Archaeopteryx brain was more complex than that of more primitive theropods, it had a more generalized brain volume among maniraptoran dinosaurs, even smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs in several instances, which indicates the <b>neurological</b> <b>development</b> required for flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade.|$|E

After all, they will be living the longest as economic, social and environmental conditions worsen. Nevertheless, over the past decade, a sea-change has been occurring as interest in sustainability education for young children has expanded, and practitioners and researchers begin to think about, develop and implement early childhood programs with an environmental or sustainability focus. It is now being recognised that the early years are the most significant growth period in a child’s life. Experiences during this phase extensively influence physical and <b>neurological</b> <b>developments</b> which drive biological, psychological and social responses throughout the entire human lifespan. The implications for early learning for sustainability are obvious. This paper expands on these ideas and provides a short case study of how one early childhood setting in Australia has sought to embed sustainability throughout all its practices – management, curriculum and through its relationships with its community, and in so doing has provided numerous opportunities for young children to act as agents of change for sustainability. The paper concludes with a summary of key characteristics of organisational change that might help other early childhood settings and services to make sustainability a central priority...|$|R

2500|$|In the 1970s, Raymond and Dorothy Moore {{conducted}} four {{federally funded}} analyses {{of more than}} 8,000 early childhood studies, from which they published their original findings in Better Late Than Early, 1975. This was followed by School Can Wait, a repackaging of these same findings designed specifically for educational professionals. They concluded that, [...] "where possible, children should be withheld from formal schooling until at least ages eight to ten." [...] Their reason was that children [...] "are not mature enough for formal school programs until their senses, coordination, <b>neurological</b> <b>development</b> and cognition are ready". They concluded that the outcome of forcing children into formal schooling is a sequence of [...] "1) uncertainty as the child leaves the family nest early for a less secure environment, 2) puzzlement at the new pressures and restrictions of the classroom, 3) frustration because unready learning tools – senses, cognition, brain hemispheres, coordination – cannot handle the regimentation of formal lessons and the pressures they bring, 4) hyperactivity growing out of nerves and jitter, from frustration, 5) [...] failure which quite naturally flows from the four experiences above, and 6) delinquency which is failure's twin and apparently for the same reason." [...] According to the Moores, [...] "early formal schooling is burning out our children. Teachers who attempt to cope with these youngsters also are burning out." [...] Aside from academic performance, they think early formal schooling also destroys [...] "positive sociability", encourages peer dependence, and discourages self-worth, optimism, respect for parents, and trust in peers. They believe this situation is particularly acute for boys because of their delay in maturity. The Moores cited a Smithsonian Report {{on the development of}} genius, indicating a requirement for [...] "1) much time spent with warm, responsive parents and other adults, 2) very little time spent with peers, and 3) a great deal of free exploration under parental guidance."

40|$|PURPOSE: According to the {{literature}} transurethral resection of the prostate in patients with Parkinson's disease has {{an increased risk of}} postoperative urinary incontinence. However, this conclusion might have been reached because some patients with multiple system atrophy incorrectly diagnosed as Parkinson's disease were included in these reports. Therefore, we investigated the outcome of transurethral prostate resection in patients with a secure neurological diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 23 patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent transurethral prostate resection for benign prostatic obstruction were evaluated retrospectively. Subsequent <b>neurological</b> <b>developments</b> in patients were followed, ensuring that those with multiple system atrophy had not been included in analysis. RESULTS: At transurethral prostate resection median patient age was 73 years, median duration of Parkinson's disease before the resection was 3 years, and median Hoehn and Yahr scale was 2. Of the 14 patients with a preoperative indwelling urinary catheter transurethral prostate resection restored voiding in 9 (64 %) and only 5 (36 %) required catheterization postoperatively. Of the 10 patients with preoperative urge urinary incontinence, continence was restored in 5 and improved in 3 following transurethral prostate resection. There were no cases of de novo urinary incontinence after transurethral prostate resection. At a median postoperative followup of 3 years transurethral prostate resection was successful in 16 of the 23 patients (70 %). CONCLUSIONS: Transurethral prostate resection for benign prostatic obstruction in patients with Parkinson's disease may be successful in up to 70 % and the risk of de novo urinary incontinence seems minimal. Thus, Parkinson's disease should no longer be considered a contraindication for transurethral prostate resection provided that preoperative investigations including urodynamic assessment indicate prostatic bladder outlet obstruction...|$|R
