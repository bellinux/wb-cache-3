Clarke's World of Strange Powers, Elsie {{said that she}} and Frances were too embarrassed to admit the truth after fooling Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes: [...] "Two village kids and a brilliant man like Conan Doyle– well, we could only keep quiet." [...] In the same interview Frances said: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> of it as being a fraud– it was just Elsie and I having a bit of fun and I can't understand to this day why they were taken in– {{they wanted to be}} taken in." ...|$|E
500|$|Santoro was {{recommended}} by Paulo Autran, who acted {{along with him}} in the TV series Hilda Furacão. After seeing Santoro's acting, he was Bodanzky's first choice for Neto's role; [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> of another person. ... When I saw him, I was impressed with his giving of himself to the role/character. I knew that Neto was him." [...] Santoro read the book and was [...] "shocked," [...] which led him to contact Carrano; after talking to the author, he was convinced to take the role. He found the story [...] "very moving, but kind of over the top," [...] and was worried about overacting and making the character [...] "fake." [...] To prepare himself for the role, he talked with interns and watched productions on the subject, among them the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Miloš Forman.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{president}} of production Jeff Robinov had hoped a third film {{would be released}} in 2011 or 2012. Nolan wanted the story for the third installment to keep him emotionally invested. [...] "On a more superficial level, I {{have to ask the}} question," [...] he reasoned, [...] "how many good third movies in a franchise can people name?" [...] Nolan said that he <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> a third film was possible in the foreword for his book The Art and Making of the Dark Knight Trilogy. Nolan only agreed to a third film on the basis of finding a worthwhile story, fearing that he would become bored halfway through production if he discovered the film to be unnecessary. By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to Inception. Later in December, Alan F. Horn confirmed that while discussions with Nolan about a third film were ongoing, no casting had been done, and Horn denied all such rumors. Before Nolan confirmed his involvement, Gary Oldman had said he was confident Nolan would return.|$|E

25|$|The {{illusion}} {{had been}} maintained up to 1906 or 1907 through the negligence {{of those whose}} job it was to clear away the rubbish, but the break was achieved in 1908.

No-one, I mean, among those who walked above the Moulin Rouge, which they would <b>never</b> <b>even</b> have <b>thought</b> of entering.|$|R
2500|$|On 10 December, Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson {{rejected}} reports {{linking the}} club with {{a bid for}} Suárez, claiming [...] "we have <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> about" [...] buying him. However, after new Ajax manager Frank de Boer stripped him of the captaincy because of the incident, Suárez declared his intentions to leave the club, saying he was [...] "ready {{for a change of}} scenery", and Liverpool eventually signed Suárez for a club record fee of £22.8m {{at the end of the}} month, signing a five-and-a-half-year contract. In an interview shortly before departing, he again denied biting Bakkal, instead describing it as a [...] "run-in".|$|E
2500|$|In early 2010, Young the Giant {{began work}} on its debut album with Grammy-winning {{producer}} Joe Chiccarelli. The album features live track recording, which the band had never previously attempted. Drummer Francois Comtois noted that working with Chiccarelli for the sessions [...] "was incredibly intimidating, but he kicked our asses into shape." [...] Gadhia also recalled the experience: [...] "We were criticized in ways we had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> of, and were constantly pushed to reach the next level. Looking back on it, [...] he shaped us into better musicians, performers, and songwriters. It was also great fun hearing his stories about Bono, Jay-Z and Elton John.|$|E
2500|$|Rumours of the {{connection}} between the title of [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] and the initialism [...] "LSD" [...] began circulating shortly after the release of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band LP in June 1967. [...] Paul McCartney gave two interviews that same month admitting to having taken the drug. Lennon later said he was surprised at the idea that the song title was a hidden reference to LSD, countering that the song [...] "wasn't about that at all", and that it [...] "was purely unconscious that it came out to be LSD. Until someone pointed it out, I <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> of it. I mean, who would ever bother to look at initials of a title?... It's not an acid song." ...|$|E

2500|$|His first novella Is She to Blame? Pisemsky wrote {{while still}} a {{university}} student. He {{gave it to}} professor Stepan Shevyryov and the latter, being an opponent of the [...] "natural school", recommended to the author [...] "to soften up everything {{and make it more}} gentlemanly." [...] Pisemsky agreed to do so, but didn't hurry to follow this advice. What he did instead was send the professor Nina, a naive story about a fresh-looking, beautiful girl who turns into a dull matron. Shevyryov made some editorial cuts and then published the story in the July 1848 issue of the Syn Otechestva magazine. So curtailed and disfigured was this version, that the author <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> of re-issuing it. The story made its way into the posthumous Wolf's Publishing House 1884 collection of Pisemsky's works (Volume 4). Even in this curtailed form it bore, according to Skabichevsky, every mark of misanthropy and pessimism, seeds of which were sown in Boyarschina.|$|E
2500|$|Chibnall said he {{mapped out}} the show's plot and {{characters}} on several whiteboards {{in his office}} before beginning the writing process. [...] "You {{have to be very}} methodical," [...] he said about plotting Broadchurch. [...] "It's like a mathematical puzzle where you put all these blocks together and move them around for the most satisfying thing." [...] Chibnall was assisted in storyboarding series two by his good friend Sam Hoyle, a television script executive who also worked with him in laying out series one. [...] "By the time I sat down to type scenes and dialogue," [...] Chibnall said, [...] "I'd already done quite a lot of work." [...] As early as mid-July 2013, Chibnall told the Daily Mirror that he had finalised the plot and written the second series' first and last scenes, and was now working {{on the rest of the}} script. Chibnall also said that the second series' themes, story, and basic mysteries are clearly established by the end of the first episode. Much of series two draws on plot elements established in series one. Lead actor Olivia Colman noted [...] "You find out very early in the first episode which direction it's going in and it's an instant, 'Whoooa!'. Chris set up a lot of things we <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> about in the first series and now they've come to the fore. At the read-through we were going, 'You sneaky b*****d'." [...] Chibnall ended series two with what he described as [...] "the cheekiest cliffhanger yet — a real shocker". Nevertheless, there were constant rewrites of the script as filming occurred.|$|E

5000|$|Ward {{described}} {{the show as}} a [...] "dark comedy" [...] and said he enjoys experiencing ambivalent emotions, such as {{the feeling of being}} [...] "happy and scared at the same time". He has also cited the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons and Dragonsof which many of the show's writers are devoteesas an inspiration for the show. Ward intends the show's world to have a coherent physical logic, and although magic exists in the story, the show's writers try to create an internal consistency in the characters' interactions with the world. In the United States, the series is rated TV-PG; Ward has said {{he does not want to}} push the boundaries of the PG rating, noting, [...] "I've <b>never</b> really <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> about the rating ... we don't like stuff that's overly gross. We like cute stuff and nice things." ...|$|R

6000|$|The good Doctor returned; {{but with}} no news which could throw light {{on the history of}} the now mysterious Mr. John Briggs. He had locked himself into the room with his father's corpse, evidently in great {{excitement}} and grief; spent several hours in walking up and down there alone; and had then gone to an attorney in the town, and settled everything about the funeral [...] "in the handsomest way," [...] said the man of law; [...] "and was quite the gentleman in his manner, but not much of a man of business; <b>never</b> had <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> of looking for his father's will; and was quite surprised when I told him that there ought to be a fair sum--eight hundred or a thousand, perhaps, to come in to him, if the stock and business were properly disposed of.

60|$|There was {{one subject}} in which Mr. Rodney {{appeared}} to be particularly interested, and that was racing. The turf at that time had not developed into that vast institution of national demoralisation which it now exhibits. That disastrous character may be mainly attributed to the determination of our legislators to put down gaming-houses, which, practically speaking, substituted for the pernicious folly of a comparatively limited class the ruinous madness of the community. There were many influences by which in the highest classes persons might be discouraged or deterred from play under a roof; and in {{the great majority of}} cases such a habit was difficult, not to say impossible, to indulge. But in shutting up gaming-houses, we brought the gaming-table into the street, and its practices became the pursuit of those who would otherwise have <b>never</b> witnessed or <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> of them. No doubt Crockford's had its tragedies, but all its disasters and calamities together would hardly equal a lustre of the ruthless havoc which has ensued from its suppression.|$|R

60|$|If any {{expression}} savouring of slang {{could possibly}} be applied to Raymond, he might {{be said to be}} struck all of a heap by his wife's proposition. He had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> of the possibility of making a home anywhere but at Compton Poynsett, or of his wife wishing that he should do so; and proverbial sayings about the incompatability of relatives-in-law suddenly assumed a reasonableness that he could not bear to remember.|$|E
60|$|No {{question}} was asked. Diane <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> objection possible. It {{was a close}} to that present life which {{she had begun to}} loathe; it gave comparative liberty. It would dull and confuse her heart-sick pain, and give her a certain superiority to her brother. Moreover, it would satisfy the old father, whom she really loved. Marriage with a worn-out old man was a simple step to full display for young ladies without fortune.|$|E
