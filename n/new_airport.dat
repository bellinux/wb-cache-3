5|$|Construction {{began on}} 16 March 2005 when Sonia Gandhi laid the {{foundation}} stone. Two days prior, the Central Government had named the airport after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who had undergone pilot training in Hyderabad. The naming resulted in opposition from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). At Begumpet Airport, the international terminal was named after Rajiv Gandhi while the domestic terminal was named after TDP founder N. T. Rama Rao; the TDP wanted to continue this naming convention at the <b>new</b> <b>airport.</b> However, the <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> has only one terminal.|$|E

5|$|In April1995, when Parliament {{decided to}} nationalize twenty-six {{regional}} airports owned by their respective municipalities, they also debated {{a proposal to}} build a <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> in Båtsfjord. At the time Widerøe was obliged to operate routes to the airport until 31March1997. In December1995, Widerøe took delivery of their fifteenth Dash8 and thus their only need for a Twin Otter was to serve Båtsfjord. From 1994 to 1997, the cost estimates for the <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> increased from NOK95 to 125million. By June1998, Parliament approved additional funding which brought the cost to NOK178 million, including a new county road for NOK8million. The airport opened on 9 September 1999. From the opening Widerøe used the Twin Otter until 1April2000, when the route {{was taken over by}} larger Dash8 aircraft. Airport security was introduced on 1January2005.|$|E

New Zealand has a high dependence on air transport and for its size, a very developed regional airport network...|$|R
50|$|MBE is the <b>newest</b> <b>airport</b> in Hokkaidō: {{it opened}} in November 1999. The airport was {{originally}} used for general aviation flights. Flights were transferred from the original Monbetsu Airport, which was located further from the city. Air Nippon inaugurated daily service to <b>New</b> Chitose <b>Airport</b> outside Sapporo that year, and added flights to Tokyo International Airport in 2000. The Sapporo service was moved to Okadama Airport in 2001 and discontinued entirely in 2003. For a short period between July and November, Hokkaido Air System offered one daily service to <b>New</b> Chitose <b>Airport</b> until 2011.|$|R
5|$|The idea to {{construct}} a <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> for Hyderabad was first conceived around 1997 by the N. Chandrababu Naidu administration. The existing commercial airport, Begumpet Airport, was unable to handle rising passenger traffic. The State Government initially considered converting Hakimpet Air Force Station to civilian use; however, the Air Force refused. When the State proposed {{the construction of a}} <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> for the Air Force, the Ministry of Defence suggested the State consider sites south of Begumpet Airport. By October 1998, the State had narrowed down to three possible locations for the new airport: Bongloor, Nadergul and Shamshabad. Due to its convenient location near two highways (NH 44 and NH 765) and a railway line, Shamshabad was selected in December 1998.|$|E
5|$|Bringelandsåsen was {{proposed}} by the CAA in 1974. Plans were developed and in 1983 the Ministry of Transport and Communications recommended that Øyrane be closed and replaced with an all-new airport at Bringeland. Construction started in 1985 and the <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> opened on 31 August 1986, taking over all scheduled traffic from Øyrane. Widerøe started scheduled services to Oslo and Bergen, originally using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and DHC-7 Dash 7 aircraft, of which the latter which was used to Oslo.|$|E
5|$|Financing of {{the airport}} at Gardermoen would be done through a state loan issued to a limited company owned by the Civil Airport Administration. This company would build and operate Gardermoen, but from 1 January 1997 it also took over {{operation}} of Fornebu. After the last aircraft took off from Fornebu on 7 October 1998, 300 people spent the night transporting 500 truckloads of equipment from Fornebu to Gardermoen. The <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> opened {{on the morning of}} 8 October 1998.|$|E

5|$|Increased {{traffic in}} the mid-1980s changed the politician's interests, and in 1988 Parliament voted {{to build a new}} main airport at Hurum, located {{on the same side of}} Oslo as Fornebu, but further away. However, new weather data showed that Hurum was unsuitable, and the {{location}} was discarded. There were accusations that the data was fabricated to manipulate the political decision. In 1992, parliament made a final vote that started construction of a <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> at Gardermoen and mandated the closure of Fornebu.|$|E
5|$|Regarding air transport, Aarhus {{is served}} by the Aarhus Airport in Tirstrup about 35km {{northeast}} of the city centre. There has been much discussion about constructing a <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> closer to the city for many years, but so far, no plans have been realised. In August 2014, the city council officially initiated a process to assert the viability of a new international airport. A small seaplane now operates four flights daily between Aarhus harbour and Copenhagen harbour.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} was delivered on 1 August 1998. While the <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> at Gardermoen would not officially open until 8 October, when also SAS and Braathens {{would move to}} the airport, Color Air started flights from Gardermoen to Ålesund Airport, Vigra on 6 August. Flights to Trondheim Airport, Værnes commenced on 8 August, while the Bergen Airport, Flesland-route started 15 August. After a week, very few passengers were traveling with Color Air, with two at the least and twenty-four at the most per departure. Color Air was losing NOK650,000 per week of operation.|$|E

25|$|The {{day before}} the accident, two {{commercial}} airliners collided over New York, killing 134. The accidents fueled the discussions in Munich and Hamburg for building <b>new</b> <b>airports</b> further away from the cities. Due to resistance of the citizens, the <b>new</b> Munich <b>airport</b> did not commence operation until 32 years later, in 1992. Hamburg still uses Fuhlsbüttel Airport, {{which was founded in}} 1911 and is the oldest airport operating in Germany.|$|R
5|$|When the <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> {{opened on}} 8 October 1998 the Flytoget airport express trains started {{operating}} immediately, {{as did the}} Gardermoen Line from Lillestrøm {{to the airport and}} onwards to Eidsvoll. Because the tunnel was not finished, trains were required to use the old Trunk Line from Oslo Central Station to Lillestrøm. After this diversion the express trains switched to the completed section of the new Gardermoen Line between Lillestrøm and Oslo Airport. Regular operations using the Romerike Tunnel started on 22 August 1999.|$|E
5|$|With {{increased}} traffic, there {{soon became}} a capacity problem at Oslo Airport, Fornebu, the main hub for both SAS and Braathens. During the peak times during the morning and afternoon rush, there were no excess slots for new airlines. To compensate, the Norwegian Airport Administration was building a new main airport for Eastern Norway, to be located at Gardermoen. A larger terminal and two runways would give ample room for expansion, and entry of new airlines. The <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> opened on 8 October 1998.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, {{after the}} <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion {{as to what to}} do with the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep a small part of Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to business travel, the airline catered offshore workers commuting to the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E

5|$|Hammerfest {{was served}} from 1935 by {{scheduled}} seaplanes at a water aerodrome at Rypefjord. Services were interrupted by World War II, but resumed in 1945, lasting until the 1963 opening of Alta Airport. Hammerfest Airport opened on 1 August 1974, along {{with four other}} regional airport in Finnmark and Troms, and was originally served with de Havilland Canada Twin Otters. The de Havilland Canada Dash 7 was introduced in 1983 and a helicopter base was established in 1989. The Dash 8 was introduced in 1995 and the airport was nationalized two years later. A Dash 8 was damaged beyond repair after a hard landing in 2005. Because of the limited space for expansion and unfavorable wind conditions, there is a proposal to build a <b>new</b> <b>airport</b> at Grøtnes.|$|E
