25|$|The {{other major}} {{sticking}} point, which is reportedly causing concern at government level, {{is that the}} majority of people going to Potsdamer Platz are visitors to the city, implying that the original vision of the development as a linking element attracting Berliners themselves, and Berliners {{from both sides of the}} former divide, has not really materialised. There are criticisms that the development does not sit easily with or connect with its surroundings, and as a result Berliners have had difficulty accepting it as theirs (despite the fact that the choice of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan was partly because it was the only one to address the way the development juxtaposed with the Cultural Forum immediately to the west, although the Cultural Forum has itself faced similar criticisms of its own). Another, more psychological factor that has played a part here is that a long-standing mutual distrust or antipathy felt between former East Berliners and West Berliners (Ossis and Wessis according to the well-known slang terms), is still very much in evidence in the city and elsewhere in Germany, and bold civil engineering projects and architectural statements are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it go away by themselves.

40|$|First, {{let me say}} one or {{two things}} about the word love. Love is such a used, abused, and misused word that people should {{possibly}} stay away from it. We use it {{for all kinds of}} purposes, to contain all kinds of meanings. Most of them are completely disconnected and unimportant. The word is especially abused in the English language, where you have love and divine love and "whatever" love. You have also the phrase making love, which is not exactly like love, but at least has a veiy clear-cut meaning. We should use other words for this, in order not be confused and mistaken. Today, we will look at the concept of love in international affairs and love in the university. The very combinations seem somehow impossible, or perhaps too ugly, to contemplate. Having discussed the problems with the word love, let me say a few words about how I would define it. I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a comprehensive definition—it's too complex and too hard. But <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a definition that has a clear meaning, clear enough to comprehend in itself, and to set borders and limits, let us say that— in essence—love is the basic experience of a feeling for the Other. In its simplest form, it is the motion of going out from myself toward the Other. That is the essence of love, and therefore any other meaning you give the word is marring it, obscuring it or making fraudulent claims...|$|R

She was looking her very best, going well with great and highly-polished spaces; and she greeted Courtier with a special cordiality of tone, which had in it, besides kindness towards one who must be feeling a strange bird, a certain diplomatic quality, compounded of desire, as it were, to 'warn him off,' and fear of saying something that might irritate and make him more dangerous.
