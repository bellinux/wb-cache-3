5|$|Tham Chee Ho contends that, {{based on}} the {{objective}} test set out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for <b>national</b> <b>security</b> matters is misplaced. This is because the courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for <b>national</b> <b>security</b> purposes, but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves <b>national</b> <b>security</b> issues. The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve <b>national</b> <b>security</b> was a matter solely for executive judgment.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{added that}} there is a need for the {{decision-maker}} to adduce evidence in court to prove that considerations of <b>national</b> <b>security</b> are involved. A mere assertion by the decision-maker that a matter involves <b>national</b> <b>security</b> does not preclude the court's judicial function of determining whether the decision was in fact based on grounds of <b>national</b> <b>security.</b> In other words, <b>national</b> <b>security</b> cannot be raised as a plea in bar to prevent the court from considering an application at all. However, what the court cannot do is decide what action <b>national</b> <b>security</b> requires. This is to be left solely to those responsible for it.|$|E

5|$|There are {{competing}} views over the appropriate {{role of the}} judiciary in matters concerning preventive detention under the ISA. A related concern is whether the judicial process is suitable for such matters. The legislative and constitutional amendments relating to judicial review under the ISA were intended to limit {{the role of the}} courts in <b>national</b> <b>security</b> matters. In 1989, Law Minister S. Jayakumar argued in Parliament that the amendments were needed because the courts would effectively be responsible for <b>national</b> <b>security</b> matters if judicial review was permitted. The subjective test was deemed necessary to reserve to the executive the responsibility for <b>national</b> <b>security</b> matters, and to enable the Government to deal effectively with security threats.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{personal}} expertise on foreign matters, Truman listened closely to his top advisors, especially George Marshall and Dean Acheson. He won bipartisan support for both the Truman Doctrine, which formalized a policy of Soviet containment, and the Marshall Plan, which aimed to help rebuild postwar Europe. To get Congress to spend the vast sums necessary to restart the moribund European economy, Truman used an ideological argument, arguing that Communism flourishes in economically deprived areas. As part of the U.S. Cold War strategy, Truman signed the <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> Act of 1947 and reorganized military forces by merging the Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (later the Department of Defense) and creating the U.S. Air Force. The act also created the CIA and the <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> Council. In 1952, Truman secretly consolidated and empowered the cryptologic elements of the United States by creating the <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> Agency (NSA).|$|E
5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern {{matters of}} <b>national</b> <b>security,</b> the Court held that this concern {{does not preclude}} the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), the Court of Appeal decided that {{it is up to}} the courts to determine whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of <b>national</b> <b>security.</b> Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to <b>national</b> <b>security</b> may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to <b>national</b> <b>security</b> from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a <b>national</b> <b>security</b> issue involved.|$|E

40|$|For {{over three}} decades, {{there have been}} {{numerous}} attempts, both federal and provincial, to create a <b>national</b> <b>securities</b> regulator for Canada. In the spring of 2010, the federal government tabled a draft Canadian Securities Act that would create a <b>national</b> <b>securities</b> regulator and referenced the draft legislation to the Supreme Court of Canada for a determination of Parliament’s constitutional authority to enact such legislation.
