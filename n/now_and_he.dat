5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>he...</b> played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
25|$|Lisa shows Homer {{her school}} science project, a robot named Linguo, who corrects grammar. Homer breaks it by pouring beer down its throat, and Lisa runs upstairs frustrated. Meanwhile, Marge accidentally severs Homer's thumb {{as she is}} cutting brownies. They drive to the hospital, but Dr. Hibbert claims that the {{insurance}} will not cover the cost, so they instead drive off for Dr. Nick's clinic. Since Homer's thumb is starting to shrivel up, he stops by at Moe's, where he gets a pickle brine solution. He gets distracted when Moe offers him a beer. Homer rushes {{out the door and}} sees Marge is gone. He hitchhikes with Cletus who drives him to Dr. Nick's, but they discover the clinic is on fire. Homer asks Cletus to drive him to Shelbyville Hospital, but his truck gets stolen and Homer leaves for the hospital on foot. His thumb is almost completely shrivelled up <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is just about to throw it away when an explosion sends Linguo's severed head flying up into the air and it lands next to him.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, Stephen tells Django that Calvin's sister, Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly, is {{in charge}} <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> will be sold to a mine and worked to death. En route to the mine, Django proves to his escorts {{that he is a}} bounty hunter by showing them his flyer. The escorts release him and give him a revolver, which he {{immediately}} uses to kill them before stealing a horse and returning to Candyland with a bag of dynamite. At the plantation, Django kills more of Calvin's henchmen, including Mr. Stonecipher and all the other trackers, takes 's freedom papers from the dead Dr. Schultz's pocket, and frees his wife from a nearby cabin. When Calvin's mourners return from his burial, Django kills Lara and the remaining henchmen, releases the two remaining house slaves, and kneecaps Stephen before igniting the dynamite that he has planted throughout the mansion. Django and [...] watch from a distance as the mansion explodes, killing Stephen, before they ride off together.|$|E

500|$|The Rhodesian press {{reported}} {{extensively on}} the Lisbon controversy {{during the second half}} of August, generally predicting that neither Britain, Portugal nor Rhodesia would back down. While most reporters believed that Whitehall would take a strong line, few could see any way it could actually stop Reedman from taking office. On 20 August, Bottomley spoke at his final conference in Lagos, and repeated all he had previously said regarding Britain's stance on Rhodesia. Back in London three days later, he reaffirmed his previous stance regarding Lisbon, saying that he would be pleased to have a Rhodesian on the staff of the British Embassy there, but would allow no more. In the same interview, he expressed the belief that Wilson had averted a Rhodesian UDI in October the previous year by warning Salisbury of the economic consequences. Speaking in Gwelo on 27 August, Smith derided this statement, calling it [...] "incredible". His administration had not even considered a declaration of independence then, he said, but it was contemplated <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> believed Anglo-Rhodesian relations were at their all-time lowest ebb. He urged Britain to return to the bargaining table quickly.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{a lonely}} Hook summons Emma because {{he loves her}} too much to stay away. Emma brings Hook to her new house, where he notices a locked door. Emma then {{attempts}} to seduce Hook; but when true love's kiss fails to break the darkness's hold on her, he rejects her. Emma is mad that he cannot accept her for who she is <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is equally angry at her for keeping what happened at Camelot a secret, though Emma tells him that giving it away would be [...] "no fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Buss had a deal in place to acquire Chris Paul from the New Orleans Hornets for Pau Gasol and Lamar Odom, but NBA {{commissioner}} David Stern blocked the trade. That season, Brown expanded Bynum's role. The next season, the Lakers acquired Steve Nash and upgraded at center, trading Bynum for Dwight Howard. The acquisition of Howard appeared to be the start of a new dynasty for the Lakers. With their $100 million payroll, the Lakers were expected to be title contenders. Instead, Brown was fired after a 1–4 start; his dismissal after five games was the third-fastest coaching change in NBA history. In a unanimous decision by Buss, his father, and Mitch Kupchak, the Lakers decided against re-hiring Jackson and signed Mike D'Antoni instead. According to NBA.com, Jerry by that time was no longer involved in the Lakers' day-to-day affairs, and rarely exercised his veto powers. [...] Buss, however, said his father continued to be [...] "involved in every decision" [...] in the final months of his life, and he chose D'Antoni. After being passed over in favor of Brown in 2011, Shaw said he was informed by Jerry that [...] "his son is in control <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> has to let him make whatever decisions that he makes." [...] The 2012–13 season ended up being a disappointment, with Buss saying [...] "we didn't get to realize the dream of four Hall of Famers on the same team." ...|$|E
