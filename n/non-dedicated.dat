2500|$|SANS 164-4 defines three {{variants}} of the 16A {{plug and socket}} intended for specialist (known as [...] "dedicated") applications. [...] The variants use a flattened earth pin, each at a different specified rotational position. [...] This arrangement ensures that the dedicated plugs can all plug into an ordinary ("non-dedicated") socket, but that the various dedicated plug and socket combinations are not interchangeable (nor can a <b>non-dedicated</b> plug be inserted into a dedicated socket).|$|E
2500|$|Creating an Opportunistic Environment {{is another}} {{implementation}} of CPU-scavenging where special workload management system harvests the idle desktop computers for compute-intensive jobs, it also refers as Enterprise Desktop Grid (EDG). For instance, HTCondor [...] the open-source high-throughput computing software framework for coarse-grained distributed rationalization of computationally intensive tasks can be configured to only use desktop machines where the keyboard and mouse are idle to effectively harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop workstations. Like other full-featured batch systems, HTCondor provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and resource management. It {{can be used}} to manage workload on a dedicated cluster of computers as well or it can seamlessly integrate both dedicated resources (rack-mounted clusters) and <b>non-dedicated</b> desktop machines (cycle scavenging) into one computing environment.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>non-dedicated</b> {{control channel}} {{can be used}} as a traffic channel when all the other traffic {{channels}} are busy. This can be useful if the site is part of a multi-site network and has a very low traffic profile as the site could have a single channel rather than at least two freeing up one channel for use elsewhere. The disadvantage is loss of queuing, and data cannot be sent on the control channel whilst it is in traffic mode. A <b>non-dedicated</b> CCH should not be used as a [...] "reserve tank" [...] for a busy site as the lack of signalling will seriously affect the operation of the site.|$|E

50|$|To {{this point}} the route is on <b>non-dedicated</b> street lanes along {{collector}} and arterial roads, much like a standard bus route.

50|$|On <b>non-dedicated</b> gaming platforms, such as Cellphones, it is {{important}} for the game running to not be the highest priority of the hardware/software system.

50|$|In {{the case}} of a <b>non-dedicated</b> Help key, the {{location}} of the key will sometimes vary between different software packages. Most common in computer history, however, is the development of a de facto Help key location for each brand/family of computer, exemplified by the use of F1 on IBM compatible PCs.|$|E
50|$|A {{spectrum}} efficiency advantage over a 4-slot TDMA system like TETRA is {{in areas where}} a low-traffic network is required. The absolute minimum TETRA installation would require one carrier, carrying one CCH and three traffic channels, using up 25 kHz of bandwidth. The absolute minimum MPT1327 assignment is a single <b>non-dedicated</b> control channel, utilising 12.5 kHz, in most cases.|$|E
50|$|Automatic flash {{bracketing}} (sometimes {{abbreviated to}} FBR for Flash Bracketing or FEB for Flash Exposure Bracketing) is typically performed by altering the flash output of a connected dedicated flash accordingly. Using <b>non-dedicated</b> studio flashes, for example on the PC socket, flash bracketing {{can be carried}} out by altering the aperture, however, this will also affect ambient light and the depth of field.|$|E

50|$|MHSnet was {{originally}} {{developed at the}} University of Sydney by Piers Lauder and Bob Kummerfeld and {{was originally}} known as SUN3 (Sydney University Network version 3). Technically, it is similar in concept to UUCP in that it enabled the transfer of email, Usenet, and files in an efficient manner over <b>non-dedicated</b> links. In addition, it supported dynamic routing and a hierarchical name space avoiding the limitations of hardwired network addresses.|$|E

Duval County Public Schools contains both dedicated magnets, which do not have set boundaries, and <b>non-dedicated</b> magnets, which are neighborhood schools that also have magnet programs.|$|E
50|$|For the {{duration}} of his call a subscriber is exclusively allocated a traffic channel from the available pool. If all channels are occupied, the call will be queued. If the control channel has become a traffic channel, like {{in the case of}} a <b>non-dedicated</b> control channel, the call will be queued in the radio, although radio queuing loses the first come, first served effect, so if there are seven units queuing, the last unit to queue may get a traffic channel first.|$|E
50|$|All DCPS schools {{offer at}} least one choice program, special program, or {{acceleration}} program to students. The majority of schools in Duval County are boundary-based and serve students residing within that boundary. Some schools, such as <b>non-dedicated</b> magnet schools serve both neighborhood {{students as well as}} students residing outside the school’s specified boundary, who are selected via lottery. In February 2016, Duval County Public Schools received a 1.2 million dollar School Improvement Grant for use towards the development of STEM labs in 11 Title-1 schools.|$|E
