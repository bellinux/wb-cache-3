5|$|It was the Swedish {{botanist}} Carl Linnaeus {{who finally}} put order into this situation as {{he attempted to}} name all the known organisms of his day. In 1735 his Systema Naturae, which included animals (the tenth edition became {{the starting point for}} zoological nomenclature) was followed by Critica Botanica in 1737, and Philosophia Botanica in 1751.

In these works Linnaeus used a third name as a variety within a species. These varieties included both wild and horticultural variants. The horticultural varieties were still written in Latin and some have persisted to this day.|$|E
