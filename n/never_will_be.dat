5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be.</b> However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents {{only a portion of}} the precious-metal wealth of the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the wealth of someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the wealth of a family that was incredibly wealthy.|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Bart Millard has {{described}} the story behind [...] "So Long Self" [...] as [...] "...really simple: It’s Not About [...] It never has been and it <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be.</b> Just like when maybe you had to break up with a girlfriend or a boyfriend growing up, or maybe {{the same thing happened}} to you, the ultimate breakup in life is when we breakup with ourselves. Because Christ said you have to die to self to follow him". The song is also lyrically about a break-up with sinful human nature.|$|E
500|$|Reyes tracks down Natalie, but Reyes is {{attacked}} and cocooned by Dylan. Dylan's mother approaches him, {{and tells him}} {{that he is not}} like other kids and <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be.</b> Doggett arrives at the girl's home and finds Reyes and Natalie alive. Dylan and his mother, however, are nowhere to be found. A subsequent search of the Lokensgard home reveals other bodies, including the bug specialist, cocooned but survived, and Dylan's father, who supposedly ran off years earlier. After leaving with his mother, Dylan sends Natalie one last message in the form of fireflies: [...] "I love you." ...|$|E

500|$|... "There was {{one moment}} in the Six-Day War which symbolized the great victory: that was the moment in which the first paratroopers – under Gur's command – reached the stones of the Western Wall, feeling the emotion of the place; there never was, and <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> another moment like it. Nobody staged that moment. Nobody planned it in advance. Nobody {{prepared}} it and nobody was prepared for it; {{it was as if}} Providence had directed the whole thing: the paratroopers weeping — loudly and in pain — over their comrades who had fallen along the way, the words of the Kaddish prayer heard by Western Wall's stones after 19 years of silence, tears of mourning, shouts of joy, and the singing of [...] "Hatikvah"".|$|E
500|$|Hill, on {{the other}} hand, argued that: [...] "The United Kingdom was not a foreign power at Federation, is not a foreign power now and <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a foreign power while the Constitution remains in its present form." [...] Hill said that because the Constitution was enacted {{as part of a}} statute of the British Imperial Parliament it derived its {{validity}} from British law. Further, she argued that because section 128 of the Australian Constitution provides that the Constitution cannot be changed except in accordance with that section, then only a constitutional referendum could change this special status of the United Kingdom, and the Australia Act had no effect, [...] "so long as the United Kingdom retained any residual influence upon legislative, executive or judicial processes in Australia, it could not be regarded as 'foreign' to Australia." ...|$|E
500|$|At the team's annual awards night, Farmer won {{the award}} for fewest {{turnovers}} per minute played (32 in 705 minutes), but the free throw award [...] won by Farmer the previous three years [...] went to Gimel Martinez. Athletics director C. M. Newton surprised the four seniors by hanging their jerseys in the rafters at Rupp Arena. In so doing, he violated the standards for the honor set by former athletics director Cliff Hagan. Those guidelines held that honorees must have completed a degree from the university and be at least 10 years removed {{from the end of}} their athletic eligibility. Newton cited the seniors' [...] "unusual and outstanding contributions" [...] to the program as reasons to make an exception to the standards, adding, [...] "I won't say there <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> another exception, but the likelihood of another is not great." [...] Sportscaster Cris Collinsworth protested Newton's action because it honored the seniors before other program standouts like Kyle Macy and Rick Robey.|$|E

500|$|Coward's {{political}} views were conservative, but not unswervingly so: he despised {{the government of}} Neville Chamberlain for its policy of appeasing Nazi Germany, and he differed sharply with Winston Churchill over the abdication crisis of 1936. Whereas Churchill supported Edward VIII's wish to marry [...] "his cutie", Wallis Simpson, Coward thought the king irresponsible, telling Churchill, [...] "England doesn't wish for a Queen Cutie." [...] Coward disliked propaganda in plays; [...] "The theatre is a wonderful place, a house of strange enchantment, a temple of illusion. What it most emphatically is not and <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> is a scruffy, ill-lit, fumed-oak drill hall serving as a temporary soap box for political propaganda." [...] Nevertheless, his own views sometimes surfaced in his plays: both Cavalcade and This Happy Breed are, {{in the words of}} the playwright David Edgar, [...] "overtly Conservative political plays written in the Brechtian epic manner." [...] In religion, Coward was agnostic. He wrote of his views, [...] "Do I believe in God? I can't say No and I can't say Yes, To me it's anybody's guess." ...|$|E
500|$|Televised {{presidential debates}} were reintroduced {{for the first}} time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first {{incumbent}} president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they [...] "gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, [...] "There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> under a Ford Administration." [...] Ford also said that he did not [...] "believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union". In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner Max Frankel was visibly incredulous at the response. As a result of this blunder, and Carter's promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the Vietnam era during the presidential debates, Ford's surge stalled and Carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls.|$|E
500|$|Later in life, Lady Munster {{became a}} novelist and short story writer, writing {{under the title}} the Countess of Munster. At the age of nearly sixty, she {{published}} two novels; her first, Dorinda, in 1889, and her second, A Scotch Earl, in 1891. The plot of Dorinda centred on {{a young woman who}} eventually kills herself after stealing works of art from her friends. Oscar Wilde noted Munster's skill in writing Dorinda; he compared the [...] "exceedingly clever" [...] novel's eponymous heroine to [...] "a sort of well-born" [...] Becky Sharp, and praised the author's ability [...] "to draw... in a few sentences the most lifelike portraits of social types and social exceptions". In 1888, an article by Munster about ballad singing appeared in The Woman's World, a Victorian women's magazine edited by Wilde. A Scotch Earl, which centred on a vulgar Scottish nobleman named Lord Invergordon, was less well received by contemporaries. The Spectator published a critical review soon after its publication which suggested that the novel's showering of [...] "contempt upon the society of wealth and rank" [...] was close to Republicanism or Socialism. The review criticised A Scotch Earl for lacking [...] "any merits of construction or style", and added that Lady Munster was [...] "not and <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a capable novelist".|$|E

2500|$|... "The EU {{is not and}} <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a superpower" [...] {{because the}} EU lacks [...] "the {{substance}} of superpowers" [...] due to shortcomings in the EU foreign & military policy according to David Miliband, the former UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, who explained the requirements: [...] "reach [...] possess the capacity to arrive quickly anywhere with troops that can impose their government's will". Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd opined: [...] "In geopolitical terms Europe is now irrelevant".|$|E
2500|$|She {{traveled}} across France {{to entertain}} the troops in 1918. Of her time at the Western Front, McMein said, [...] "Since I have lived through air bombing I <b>never</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> frightened by anything on earth. The terror of air raids cannot be imagined. They are heralded by the blowing of sirens and the ringing of church bells, and amid this din the lights are extinguished and then suddenly come the bombs, falling no one knows where.
