5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{native to}} central and eastern Europe and western Asia. Its <b>natural</b> <b>range</b> includes Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, southern Russia, Switzerland and the former Yugoslavia. Reports of it occurring in eastern Turkey {{have been found to}} refer to A. heldreichii subsp. trautvetteri.|$|E
5|$|The band-pass of {{an atomic}} line filter is usually {{equal to the}} Doppler profile of the vapor cell, the <b>natural</b> <b>range</b> of {{frequencies}} at which a vapor cell will be excited by a pure light source. The Doppler profile is {{the width of the}} spectrum of Doppler shifted radiation emitted by the vapor cell due to its thermal motion. This value is less for larger atoms at lower temperatures, a system considered more ideal.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{populations of}} black wildebeest, endemic to the {{southern}} part of Africa, were almost completely exterminated in the 19th century, due to their reputation as pests and the value of their hides and meat. However, the species has been reintroduced widely from captive specimens, both in private areas and nature reserves throughout most of Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa. It has also been introduced outside its <b>natural</b> <b>range</b> in Namibia and Kenya.|$|E

50|$|Loehle {{worked as}} a {{research}} ecologist at Savannah River Laboratory from 1987 to 1991, and in the environmental research division at Argonne National Laboratory from 1991 to 1998. While at Argonne, he conducted research which found that trees can grow to maturity up to a thousand miles south of their <b>natural</b> <b>ranges,</b> but only fifty to a hundred miles north of their <b>natural</b> <b>ranges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{species are}} widely {{cultivated}} as ornamental plants {{outside of their}} <b>natural</b> <b>ranges,</b> though cultivation is often difficult due to their intolerance of root disturbance. The hybrid Arbutus 'Marina' is much more adaptable and thrives under garden conditions.|$|R
5|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>range</b> of Potamon fluviatile {{is highly}} fragmented, and covers parts of many {{countries}} with a Mediterranean coastline. It {{is found in}} mainland Italy and on the Balkan Peninsula from Dalmatia to the Axios River in Greece. It is also found {{on a number of}} islands, including Sicily, Malta and Gozo, the Ionian Islands, Aegean Islands, Sporades and Andros in the Cyclades. Although the species as a whole is widespread, it is declining in numbers, and these insular populations are particularly vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|The species also occurs {{outside its}} <b>natural</b> <b>range</b> in Australia, {{where it can}} be found in the warm {{effluent}} of power stations in Victoria, and in tropical Queensland. It has also been captured in Perth, Western Australia, although this initial capture also resulted in its eradication. In addition to Australia, the species has been introduced to Réunion, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, Taiwan, and the USA.|$|E
5|$|It is ectomycorrhizally {{associated}} with several tree species and is symbiotic with them. In Europe, these include hardwood and, less frequently, conifer species. It appears most commonly under oaks, but also under beeches, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, birches, filberts, hornbeams, pines, and spruces. In other areas, A.phalloides {{may also be}} {{associated with}} these trees or with only some species and not others. In coastal California, for example, A.phalloides is associated with coast live oak, {{but not with the}} various coastal pine species, such as Monterey pine. In countries where it has been introduced, it has been restricted to those exotic trees with which it would associate in its <b>natural</b> <b>range.</b> There is, however, evidence of A.phalloides associating with hemlock and with genera of the Myrtaceae: Eucalyptus in Tanzania and Algeria, and Leptospermum and Kunzea in New Zealand. This suggests the species may have invasive potential.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the species}} have been {{introduced}} accidentally outside of their <b>natural</b> <b>ranges,</b> notably C. ribicola into North America, where it is an invasive species causing heavy mortality in several pines which {{have little or no}} resistance to it.|$|R
50|$|Keeping Common Birds Common - Common native birds, both {{resident}} and migratory, must remain common throughout their <b>natural</b> <b>ranges.</b> These species comprise {{the core of}} our avian diversity and are integral to the integrity of the ecosystems of which they are a part.|$|R
50|$|Salado {{is located}} along the Balcones Fault, which causes the {{emergence}} of surface waters. The fault line is also a demarcation line for some species' <b>natural</b> <b>ranges.</b> For example, the California Fan Palm, Washingtonia filifera, occurs strictly west of Salado or the Balcones Fault.|$|R
5|$|The bald eagle's <b>natural</b> <b>range</b> covers most of North America, {{including}} most of Canada, {{all of the}} continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England, northern birds are migratory, while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. Today, {{they are much more}} common (almost attaining their peak numbers pre-colonization in North America), and nest in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{range of}} any species {{is that of}} the rock dove. This species had a large natural {{distribution}} from Britain and Ireland to northern Africa, across Europe, Arabia, Central Asia, India, the Himalayas and up into China and Mongolia. The range of the species increased dramatically upon domestication, as the species went feral in cities around the world. The species is currently resident across most of North America, and has established itself in cities and urban areas in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. The species is not the only pigeon to have increased its range due to the actions of man; several other species have become established outside of their <b>natural</b> <b>range</b> after escaping captivity, and other species have increased their natural ranges due to habitat changes caused by human activity.|$|E
5|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>range</b> of A.vera is unclear, as {{the species}} {{has been widely}} {{cultivated}} around the world. Naturalised strands of the species occur in the southern half of the Arabian Peninsula, through North Africa (Morocco, Mauritania, Egypt), as well as Sudan and neighbouring countries, along with the Canary, Cape Verde, and Madeira Islands. This distribution is somewhat {{similar to that of}} Euphorbia balsamifera, Pistacia atlantica, and a few others, suggesting that a dry sclerophyll forest once covered large areas, but has been dramatically reduced due to desertification in the Sahara, leaving these few patches isolated. For comparison, several closely related (or sometimes identical) species within other plant groups {{can be found on the}} two extreme sides of the Sahara: dragon trees (Dracaena) and Aeonium being two of the most representative examples.|$|E
5|$|The {{sycamore}} may hybridise {{with other}} species in Acer section Acer, including with A. heldreichii where their <b>natural</b> <b>ranges</b> overlap and with A.velutinum. Intersectional hybrids with A. griseum (Acer section Trifoliata) are also known, {{in which the}} basal lobes of the leaf are reduced in size, making the leaves appear almost three-lobed (trifoliate).|$|R

5|$|Three species {{occur in}} both New Guinea and Australia. Some species have {{widespread}} distributions, with the galah, for example, occurring {{over most of}} Australia, whereas other species have tiny distributions, confined to {{a small part of}} the continent, such as the Baudin's black cockatoo of Western Australia or to a small island group, such as the Tanimbar corella, which is restricted to the Tanimbar Islands of Indonesia. Some cockatoos have been introduced accidentally to areas outside their <b>natural</b> <b>range</b> such as New Zealand, Singapore, and Palau, while two Australian corella species have been introduced to parts of the continent where they are not native.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{geographic}} {{location of the}} city, {{with respect to the}} principal storm tracks, is especially favorable which is why it has earned the reputation as a vacation destination. It is south of the average path of storms originating in the higher latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms, with the exception of Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Because of the moderating effects of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach is the northernmost location on the east coast in which many species of plants (both subtropical and tropical) will reliably grow. Spanish moss, for example is near the northernmost limit of its <b>natural</b> <b>range</b> at First Landing State Park, and is the most northerly location where it is widespread. Other plants like Sabal palmetto, Pindo Palm, Windmill Palm, Hardy Citrus, and Oleander are successfully grown here while they succumb to the colder winter temperatures to the north and inland to the west.|$|E
5|$|Highly abundant, {{the brown}} roll-rim is found across the Northern Hemisphere, Europe and Asia, with records from India, China, Japan, Iran, and Turkey's eastern Anatolia. It is equally widely {{distributed}} across northern North America, extending north to Alaska, {{where it has}} been collected from tundra near Coldfoot in the interior of the state. In southwestern Greenland, P. involutus has been recorded under the birch species Betula nana, B. pubescens and B. glandulosa. The mushroom is more common in coniferous woods in Europe, but is also closely associated with birch (Betula pendula). Within woodland, it prefers wet places or boggy ground, and avoids calcareous (chalky) soils. It has been noted to grow alongside Boletus badius in Europe, and Leccinum scabrum and Lactarius plumbeus in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. There it is found in both deciduous and coniferous woodland, commonly under plantings of white birch (Betula papyrifera) in urban areas. It is one of a small number of fungal species which thrive in Pinus radiata plantations planted outside their <b>natural</b> <b>range.</b> A study of polluted Scots pine forest around Oulu in northern Finland found that P.involutus became more abundant in more polluted areas while other species declined. Emissions from pulp mills, fertiliser, heating and traffic were responsible for the pollution, which was measured by sulfur levels in the pine needles.|$|E

40|$|Neutrino data lead via the see-saw {{mechanism}} to {{masses of the}} right handed neutrinos at the intermediate mass scale. Simple formalism is suggested which incorporates the quark - lepton symmetry and allows one to find properties of the intermediate scale (masses and mixing) from neutrino data. Averaged mass scale and the mass hierarchy parameter are introduced and fixed by the data. They determine <b>natural</b> <b>ranges</b> of masses and mixing at the intermediate scale. In particular, scenario which includes the MSW solution of the solar neutrino problem and tau neutrino as the hot component of Dark Matter of the Universe leads to M_ 2 = (2 - 4) · 10 ^ 10 GeV and M_ 3 = (4 - 8) · 10 ^ 12 GeV {{in agreement with the}} linear mass hierarchy. Strong deviations from the <b>natural</b> <b>ranges</b> imply fine tuning of parameters or/and certain symmetry of the Majorana mass matrix of the right handed neutrinos.
