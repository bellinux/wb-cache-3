For 19/29JulyO.S./N.S. these three men, accompanied by Father Kalkhoven, gathered in Drochtersen the Kehdingen farmers tithing to the convent, and declared that from then on the tithe would be collected by the Jesuits.

25|$|Scutum is not {{a bright}} constellation, with the {{brightest}} star, Alpha Scuti, at magnitude 3.85. But some stars are notable in the constellation. Beta Scuti is the second brightest at magnitude 4.22, followed by Delta Scuti at magnitude 4.72. Beta Scuti is a binary system, with the primary with a spectral type similar to the Sun, although it is 1,270 times brighter. Delta Scuti is a bluish white giant star, which is <b>now</b> <b>coming</b> {{at the direction of}} the Solar System. Within 1.3 million years it will come as close to 10 light years from Earth, and will be much brighter than Sirius by that time.|$|E

25|$|The first ODI saw England bowled out {{for just}} 130, which New Zealand easily chased down {{to win the}} match by six wickets. The second game saw England thrashed by ten wickets after being bowled out for just 158. England kept the series alive by winning the next game on the DL Method, {{following}} a good performance from Stuart Broad, a player who Moores had given his debut to and was <b>now</b> <b>coming</b> to rely on as a key player.

25|$|On May 13, 2009, Pakistan's {{ambassador}} to the United States Husain Haqqani revealed on The Daily Show to Jon Stewart that Pakistan's decision to strike a peace deal with Taliban militants earlier, which effectively ceded control of large swathes of the country's northwest, {{was all part of}} a cunning plan to fool the Taliban, which is <b>now</b> <b>coming</b> to fruition with the commencement of Operation Black Thunderstorm. The ambassador mentioned to Jon Stewart that President Asif Ali Zardari's signing of the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation, which was the Swat peace deal, {{was nothing more than a}} trick to lure the Taliban from the mountains and countryside to the main towns where it would be much easier for the Pakistani military to kill or capture them.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} small city of 61,550 (2009 estimates) and often overlooked by visitors to nearby coastal resorts, Muğla {{has received a}} new boost with the foundation of Muğla University in the 1990s. Today, the university brings together a student community of 16,000 and, added by its academia and staff, it {{played a key role}} in bringing movement to the city and in opening it to the outside world. Its former profile of a predominantly rural, difficult to access, isolated and underpopulated region enclosed with a rugged mountainous complex is <b>now</b> <b>coming</b> to an end. Also in recent years, a major program of restoration of the city's architectural heritage has enhanced local tourism. The city remains an orderly, compact and leafy provincial center which could keep its old neighborhoods without surrendering to a boom in concrete constructions and displays a progressist mind as exemplified by the pride still expressed on having had Turkey's first female provincial governor in the 1990s, Ms. Lale Aytaman. Nevertheless, Muğla still lacks sizeable manufacturing and processing centers and relies on trades, crafts, services, tourism and agriculture in its economy.|$|E

Many Americans were sympathetic to the Hungarian rebels, especially recent German immigrants, who were <b>now</b> <b>coming</b> to the U.S. in large numbers and had become a major political force. Kossuth was feted by Congress, and Fillmore allowed a White House meeting after receiving word that Kossuth would not try to politicize it.

[...] The American enthusiasm for Kossuth petered out, and he departed for Europe; Fillmore refused to change American policy, remaining neutral.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Ramsey was in Rabi's {{magnetron}} group. When Rabi {{became a}} division head, Ramsey became the group leader. The {{role of the}} group was to develop the magnetron to permit a reduction in wavelength from [...] to , and then to [...] or X-Band. Microwave radar promised to be small, lighter and more efficient than older types, Ramsey's group started with the design produced by Oliphant's team in Britain, and attempted to improve it. The Radiation Laboratory produced the designs, which were prototyped by Raytheon, and then tested by the laboratory. In June 1941, Ramsey travelled to Britain, where he met with Oliphant, and the two exchanged ideas. He brought back some British components which were incorporated into the final design. A night fighter aircraft, the Northrop P-61 Black Widow, was designed around the new radar. Ramsey returned to Washington in late 1942 as an adviser {{on the use of}} the new 3cm microwave radar sets that were <b>now</b> <b>coming</b> into service, working for Edward L.
