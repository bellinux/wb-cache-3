5|$|By 1914 the non-militant {{elements}} of the suffrage movement had built up a steady presence and, although damaged by the bad press violent action brought, they also gained from the publicity. A summer school {{had been set up}} by the NUWSS in the Conwy Valley the previous year and <b>now</b> <b>their</b> members were benefitting from the training in public speaking that was given. In south Wales signs of working-class involvement in the suffrage cause took shape through the Women's Co-operative Guild, with a branch opening in Ton Pentre in the Rhondda in 1914 run by Elizabeth Andrews.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 Henry Morrison Flagler {{brought the}} Florida East Coast Railway to Miami. Mary Ann and William Davis {{had dreamed of}} {{building}} a city on Key Biscayne. <b>Now</b> <b>their</b> son Waters was a retired millionaire, and interested only in preserving Key Biscayne as a quiet retreat for his family. For a while Flagler's arrival did disturb their quiet, as Flagler brought in dredges to deepen the Cape Florida Channel and the approaches {{to the mouth of}} the Miami River, muddying the formerly clear waters of Biscayne Bay. Soon, however, a shorter route from the ocean to Miami was dredged through the southern end of what is now Miami Beach, at Government Cut, and the Cape Florida Channel was allowed to return to a natural state.|$|E

In 1997, a compilation album consisting of fourteen tracks was released.|$|E

5|$|On Beecham's {{return to}} England in 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert {{together}} that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, <b>now</b> <b>their</b> own employers, {{declined to give}} him the unfettered control that he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham, unwilling to be answerable to anybody, left the LPO and in 1946 founded a rival orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic (RPO).|$|E
5|$|The Laysan duck is an insular {{relative}} of the mallard, with a very small and fluctuating population. Mallards sometimes arrive on its island home during migration, and {{can be expected to}} occasionally have remained and hybridised with Laysan ducks as long as these species have existed. However, these hybrids are less well adapted to the peculiar ecological conditions of Laysan Island than the local ducks, and thus have lower fitness. These ducks were found throughout the Hawaiian archipelago before 400AD, after which they suffered a rapid decline during the Polynesian colonisation. <b>Now,</b> <b>their</b> range includes only Laysan Island. It is one of the successfully translocated birds, after having become nearly extinct in the early 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|During the interregnum, Hippesley {{initially}} {{continued as}} captain of Sandgate, {{until he was}} replaced in 1653, resulting in complaints from {{him that he had}} been unfairly treated and that he was owed money by Parliament. During this period the garrison was increased to include a governor, two corporals, twenty soldiers and three gunners. When Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660, Sandgate and the other Device Forts initially remained {{at the heart of the}} south coast defences, but by <b>now</b> <b>their</b> design was antiquated. The garrison was cut back to its pre-war levels, and then reduced further in 1682 to only ten men. Sandgate had fallen into a poor condition, and £200 was assigned in 1663 for the repair of the castle, to be met partially from the proceeds of lands around Sandgate confiscated from former supporters of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|The king's {{court and}} the deputies of the National Constituent Assembly were all in {{comfortable}} residence at the royal city of Versailles, where they were considering momentous changes to the French political system. Reformist deputies had managed to pass sweeping legislation {{in the weeks after}} the Bastille's fall, including the revolutionary August Decrees (which formally abolished most noble and clerical privileges) and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. <b>Now</b> <b>their</b> attention was turned {{to the creation of a}} permanent constitution. Monarchists and conservatives of all degrees had thus far been unable to resist the surging strength of the reformers, but by September their positions were beginning, however slightly, to improve. In constitutional negotiations they were able to secure a legislative veto power for the king. Many of the reformers were left aghast by this, and further negotiations were hobbled by contentiousness.|$|E
5|$|The {{main points}} of historiographical dispute {{about the battle}} are {{whether or not the}} Egyptians were {{planning}} to advance northward toward Tel Aviv, and whether or not the battle was one of the turning points of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. On June 18, after the first truce of the war took effect, Nahum Sarig said in a staff meeting, attended by the Minister of Defense, that at the time the Egyptian plans were not clear, but that <b>now</b> <b>their</b> plans were to penetrate the Negev. Ben Gurion, on the other hand, noted in his diary that the Egyptians were set on taking Tel Aviv and advancing north. In 1958, Major General Yitzhak Rabin addressed the issue; he felt that the Egyptian stop at Isdud was the result of technical difficulties, following fifteen days of continuous movement, including battles along the way. This, Rabin thought, along with ground and aerial counterattacks, eventually delayed their drive on Tel Aviv. Later, he said, the Egyptians tried to make contact with the Jordanian forces at Latrun and, after a failed pincer movement, tried to cut the Negev off from Israel. According to Israeli historian Reuven Aharoni, the battle's glorification and idealization suited the sentimental needs of the Israeli people. He believes that there is still no definite {{answer to the question of}} whether or not the Egyptians planning to drive on to Tel Aviv.|$|E
5|$|Working together, the Autobots {{and human}} {{soldiers}} manage to rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak, Starscream, Soundwave and Shockwave, with Optimus using Shockwave's arm-cannon to blast the Control Pillar, disabling the Space Bridge. Sam confronts Gould as he reactivates the Control Pillar, and knocks Gould into the Pillar, electrocuting him. Bumblebee and Ratchet arrive {{and destroy the}} Control Pillar, permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially transported Cybertron to implode. Optimus and Sentinel fight while Carly convinces Megatron {{that he will be}} replaced by Sentinel as leader of the Decepticons. Sentinel severs Optimus' right arm, and is about to execute him when Megatron intervenes, incapacitating Sentinel. Megatron slyly proposes a truce, having the desire to become the one in charge again, but Optimus instead attacks Megatron, decapitating and killing him. Sentinel pleads for his life, but Optimus executes him too for betraying his own principles. With the Decepticons defeated, Carly and Sam are reunited and the Autobots accept that, with Cybertron gone for good, Earth is <b>now</b> <b>their</b> home.|$|E

25|$|In the aftermath, the English of Connecticut Colony had to {{deal with}} the anger of the Pequots. The Pequots {{attempted}} to get their allies to join their cause, some 36 tributary villages, but were only partly effective. The Western Niantic (Nehantic) joined them, but the Eastern Niantic (Nehantic) remained neutral. The traditional enemies of the Pequot, the Mohegan and the Narragansett, openly sided with the English. The Narragansetts had warred with and lost territory to the Pequots in 1622. <b>Now</b> <b>their</b> friend Roger Williams urged the Narragansetts to side with the English against the Pequots.|$|E

Realizing that Lazarus was <b>now</b> <b>their</b> prime suspect, the detectives informed their superiors of this and arranged to discreetly collect a voluntarily discarded DNA sample from her, knowing they would have to do so without getting a warrant, which would have let Lazarus know she was under investigation for the murder. While off-duty running errands, Lazarus discarded a cup from which she had been drinking, which police retrieved. A sample was taken from it, and it matched the DNA from the bite mark on Sherri Rasmussen.|$|E

David expresses his {{frustration}} at being thwarted when they were so close to wiping out the Darkness, but Mary Margaret reminds him {{that they would have}} chosen to save their loved ones in any situation, which Emma did. Merlin tells them that this was the darkest possible future he saw for Emma, and that <b>now,</b> <b>their</b> fight to destroy the Darkness had become much more difficult. Merlin sends Sir Lancelot to find his mother, the Lady of the Lake, as she can help them defeat the Darkness. Merlin heads back to the diner, while the others continue their search for Emma and Hook around the restaurant.|$|E
25|$|Assigned to 11th (East Africa) Division, {{it moved}} east from Imphal to Tamu {{and down the}} 'pestilential' Kabaw Valley to the Chindwin to meet 5th (Indian) Division at Kalemyo. 11th EA Division with its AA support then moved north up the Chindwin to Kalewa, an {{important}} ferry centre {{which was to be}} the crossing site for XXXIII Corps. A bridgehead was secured and the engineers began building a 1100-foot Bailey bridge on pontoons. Japanese air attacks had been slight up to this point, but <b>now</b> <b>their</b> aircraft made a determined attempt to knock out the bridge.

25|$|A more {{detailed}} Georgian government account was released later on August 30. According to it, the crisis had begun on August 28, when the armed group captured a patrol of the Border Police of Georgia {{who had been}} searching for the five missing local residents. The gunmen agreed to an offer by a senior border guard officer to keep just him as a hostage and to let go the civilians and the other border guards. Later, an official from the Georgian Interior Ministry arrived to negotiate and demanded their surrender, which was rejected. The group then decided to swap the last captive border guard for the official, telling him that he is <b>now</b> <b>their</b> hostage. Two of the gunmen then accompanied the official to a location where he could talk with his superiors to update them about the new developments, but instead they were led to an ambush site, where {{one of them was}} shot dead by a government sniper. The shooting sparked a firefight, in which 10 more members of the armed group and three Georgian troops were killed. Georgian forces used helicopters and aerial drones.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays, Kirkcaldy {{remains a}} busy {{town for the}} {{surrounding}} areas complete with modernised secondary schools; two campuses of the Adam Smith College and prime shopping facilities in the town centre and Sinclairtown. The town also hosts the annual Links Market commonly known as Europe's longest street fair. The production of linoleum still continues to this day, despite being on a vastly reduced scale and now in Swiss ownership. The company, which has since become known as forbo nairn has also diversfied into the production of vinyl floor tiles and marmoleum for which the latter is <b>now</b> <b>their</b> speciality. The construction of a retail and business park, to the north–west of the town centre has also opened in the last decade. The town has also been the site for recent housing developments as seen in Seafield, Chapel and the harbour. More housing developments are being anticipated {{over the course of}} the next 20 years, which will see 1700 homes to the east, in use as open cast mines at present, and another 1200 homes to the south–east, overlooking the former A92, known locally as the Quarry Road. Other future plans proposed by Fife Council will include replacing the 89-year-old sea wall on the promenade; starting up the delayed hovercraft service and building a replacement secondary school for Viewforth to serve the east side of Kirkcaldy.|$|E
