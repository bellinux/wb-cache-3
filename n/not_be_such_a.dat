2500|$|In the Battle of Nish the crusaders were victorious {{and forced}} Kasim Pasha of Rumelia and his co-commander Turahan Bey {{to flee to}} Sofia, Bulgaria to warn Murad of the invasion. However, the two burned all the villages in their path {{in an attempt to}} wear down the crusaders with a {{scorched}} earth tactic. [...] When they arrived in Sofia, they advised the Sultan to burn the city and retreat to the mountain passes beyond, where the Ottoman's smaller army would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> disadvantage.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{procedural}} {{processes are}} not always necessarily damning in this way. Immanuel Kant, a great influence for Rawls, similarly applies a lot of procedural practice within the practical application of The Categorical Imperative, however, this is indeed not based solely on 'fairness'. Even though an example like the one above regarding the orange would not be something that required the practical application of The Categorical Imperative, it is important [...] to draw distinction between Kant and Rawls, and note that Kant's Theory would not necessarily lead to the same problems Rawls' does— i.e., the cutting in half of the orange. Kant's Theory promotes acting out of Duty— acting for the Summum Bonum for him, The Good Will - and in fact encourages Judgement, too. What this would mean [...] is that {{the outcome of the}} Orange's distribution would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> simple process for Kant as the reason why it would be wanted by both parties would necessarily have {{to be a part of}} the Judgement process, thus eliminating the problem that Rawls' account suffers here.|$|E

By early April, Kingia australis plants were re-shooting and flowering abundantly in heavily burnt areas but the legacy of the fire will be felt for some time to come. Local populations of kangaroos and other wildlife were injured and local residents assisted in their care and recovery where possible.
