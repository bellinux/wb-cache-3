Maria Theresa's ally, the Elector of Saxony, now became her enemy and GeorgeII declared the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg to be neutral. The Queen {{was once again}} in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> from Hungary. In order to obtain it, she granted favours to the Hungarian noblemen and flattered them without conceding to all of their demands. She had already won their support when she appeared in Pressburg in September 1741, hoping to persuade the Diet to call a mass conscription and recognise Francis Stephen as co-ruler. Upon achieving both goals, she showed her gift for theatrical displays by triumphantly holding her son and heir, Joseph, before the Diet, thereby gaining sympathy of the noblemen.|$|E

500|$|Anton Chekhov in {{his plays}} The Seagull, Uncle Vanya and Three Sisters {{describes}} the tortured emotional states of doctors who {{at some point}} in their careers have turned their back on conscience. In his short stories, Chekhov also explored how people misunderstood the voice of a tortured conscience. A promiscuous student, for example, in The Fit describes it as a [...] "dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was like anguish and the most acute fear and despair... in his breast, under the heart" [...] and the young doctor examining the misunderstood agony of compassion experienced by the factory owner's daughter in From a Case Book calls it an [...] "unknown, mysterious power... in fact close at hand and watching him." [...] Characteristically, Chekhov's own conscience drove him on the long journey to Sakhalin to record and alleviate the harsh conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost. As Irina Ratushinskaya writes in the introduction to that work: [...] "Abandoning everything, he travelled to the distant island of Sakhalin, the most feared place of exile and forced labour in Russia at that time. One cannot help but wonder why? Simply, because the lot of the people there was a bitter one, because nobody really knew about the lives and deaths of the exiles, because he felt that they stood in greater <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> that anyone else. A strange reason, maybe, but not for a writer who was the epitome of all the best traditions of a Russian man of letters.
