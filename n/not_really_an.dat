Miller, who interviewed {{a large number of}} Richardson's colleagues for his 1995 biography, notes that when talking about Richardson's acting, [...] "magical" [...] was a word many of them used. The Guardian judged Richardson [...] "indisputably our most poetic actor". For The Times, he [...] "was ideally {{equipped}} to make an ordinary character seem extraordinary or an extraordinary one seem ordinary". [...] He himself touched on this dichotomy in his variously reported comments that acting was [...] "merely the art of keeping a large group of people from coughing" [...] or, alternatively, [...] "dreaming to order".|$|E

The protests featured a flash mob with fifty dancers performing a choreographed dance to a song with the lyrics, [...] "We don't want your cigarettes. Jeff we can!" [...] The performance ended with the mascot: [...] "rolling {{around on the floor}} in a coughing fit and loss of breath". Shana Narula, the campaign's coordinator, said: The whole concept is to use Jeff and the hashtag #JeffWeCan and #StopMarlboro to show that these marketing tactics are not allowed and tobacco is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the world. And the fact is it's the only consumer product that when used as intended, it kills its user. This is very, very unique — no other consumer product does this. Most people think that tobacco is <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> issue in this country anymore and that's completely not true. That's what we want to shed light on today, in a fashion where people will take notice.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{formative}} {{years of the}} Gypsy Horse, the Roma bred not only for specific colour, profuse feather, and greater bone, but also for increased action and smaller size. To increase action at the trot, they first tried Hackney Pony breeding, but this blood reduced both feather and bone. The Roma therefore turned to the Section D Welsh Cob to add a more animated trot to the breed without loss of other desired traits. Another trend in breeding was a steady decrease in height, a trend still present among many Romani breeders. In the 1990s, the breed's average height still was in excess of , but horses of [...] were beginning {{to be viewed as}} more desirable, primarily for economic reasons. John Shaw, a carriage painter from Milnrow, Rochdale, Lancaster, was quoted in 1993 as saying, [...] "Very big, hairy coloureds are now in vogue.

[...] Band member Jesse [...] "Baby J." [...] Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is." [...] The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel. [...] As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: [...] "We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, but we always try to maintain some uniqueness." [...] "I don't think many people would call us a traditional oldtime band," [...] states bandleader David Sickmen: [...] "I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals. Then we have some old-time songs we play in our own way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2010, {{the church}} {{announced}} that it would buy the campus outright from the city of Houston for $7.5 million, terminating the lease after 7 years.

[...] Aaron explained that the church [...] "put a phenomenal amount of money into the facility after the lease was initially structured, and it's really not fair that someone else would get the benefit of that." [...] Aaron added that converting the property to a stadium-oriented facility [...] "would probably cost as much or more than it took {{to turn it into a}} church, and right now there are probably not very many organizations that would be willing to step forward and do that." [...] The Houston City Council was scheduled to vote on the matter on Wednesday March 24, 2010. City council delayed the vote. On March 30 of that year, Ronald Green, the city's chief financial officer, said that he approved of the sale of the building. On March 31, 2010 the Houston City Council voted 13–2 to sell the property to Lakewood.|$|E

2500|$|Kenny G has {{attracted}} significant criticism from mainstream jazz musicians and enthusiasts. Pat Metheny {{stated that he}} was a [...] "pop" [...] saxophonist, [...] "but was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> advanced player, even in that style", adding that he had [...] "major rhythmic problems" [...] and that his [...] "harmonic and melodic vocabulary was extremely limited, mostly to pentatonic based and blues-lick derived patterns". Metheny believes that the main reason why Kenny G has become unpopular and easy to attack by accomplished jazz musicians is due to the [...] "fact that he sells an enormous amount of records while not being anywhere near a really great player in relation to the standards that have been set on his instrument over the past sixty or seventy years". [...] Branford Marsalis once stated in an interview with Jazziz magazine: [...] "When all these jazz guys get in a tizzy over Kenny G, they need to leave Kenny alone. He's not stealing jazz. The audience he has wouldn't be caught dead at a real jazz concert or club. It's not like some guy says, ‘You know, I used to listen to Miles, 'Trane and Ornette. And then I heard Kenny G, and I never put on another Miles record.' It's a completely different audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Grubb was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> ironmaster, but a builder. [...] In 1745 he leased the {{ironworks}} to a consortium, Cury and Company, for 25 {{years and}} returned to Wilmington. The consortium continued the operation, with ownership passing to Peter's sons, Curtis and Peter Jr., {{after his death in}} 1754. The brothers took over the operation in 1765 and ran it quite successfully until the late 1780s. Curtis operated the Cornwall Furnace and lived on site; c1773 he built the original 19 rooms of the mansion that still stands prominently next to the property. Peter Jr. ran a forge at Hopewell, refining the pig iron produced by the furnace into more valuable bar iron. [...] The ironworks were major suppliers to the Revolutionary War effort, and George Washington once visited to inspect the operation. Unfortunately for the Grubb family, as described in [...] Curtis Grubb's biography, they were unable to retain control of the operation after Curtis' marriage in 1783. Most of the Grubb's holdings gradually fell into the hands of Robert Coleman, culminating in 1798. Coleman's son, William, was named manager of Cornwall Furnace and lived in the mansion; in 1865 the Colemans remodeled it into the 29 room structure known today as Buckingham Mansion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{issue with}} using any cut-off date as a startpoint {{is that it}} {{excludes}} everything before that date despite cricket's history making clear {{that there has been}} a continuous standard of top-class cricket in England since the late 17th century. It is true that none of the cricketers with large career totals played before 1864 (Webber's main reason for adopting that date) and so his startpoint was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> issue in that context. It does, however, exclude numerous leading players and it impacts other cricket records. If first-class cricket did not begin until 1864, then legendary cricketers like Richard Newland, John Small, William Beldham, Alfred Mynn and William Caffyn were not [...] "first-class players". Among records, the lowest known team score occurred in the 1810 match between All-England and The Bs (with Wells and Lawrell) when The Bs were dismissed for 6 in their second innings; and that match is not regarded as first-class by those statisticians who still use 1815 or 1864 as their statistical startpoint. The real significance of 1864 was the legalisation of overarm bowling but there is also evidence of a more structured approach to inter-county cricket which ultimately brought about the introduction of the official County Championship. 1864 was also the first year in which Wisden Cricketers' Almanack was published and this is seen as the key source for cricket records, although there are plenty of earlier sources.|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{preliminary}} rulings on {{the proper}} interpretation of EU law, an essential function of the Court of Justice is judicial review of the acts of the EU itself. Under TFEU article 263(1) the Court can review the legality of any EU legislative of other [...] "act" [...] against the Treaties or general principles, {{such as those in}} the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This includes legislation, and most other acts that have legal consequences for people. For example, in Société anonyme Cimenteries CBR Cementsbedrijven NV v Commission the Commission made a decision to withdraw an assurance to a Dutch cement company that it would be immune from competition law fines, for vertical agreements. The cement company challenged the decision, and the Commission argued this was <b>not</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> [...] "act", and so could not be challenged. The Court of Justice held a challenge could be made, and it was an act, because it [...] "deprived [...] of the advantages of a legal situation... and exposed them to a grave financial risk". Similarly in Deutsche Post v Commission the Commission demanded information on state aid given by Germany to Deutsche Post within 20 days. When both challenged this, the Commission argued that the demand for information could not be an act as there was no sanction. The Court of Justice disagreed, and held judicial review could proceed because the request produced [...] "binding legal effects" [...] since the information supplied or not could be relied upon as evidence in a final decision. By contrast, in IBM v Commission the Court of Justice held that a letter from the Commission to IBM that it would sue IBM for abusing a dominant position contrary to competition was not a reviewable act, but just a preliminary statement of intent to act. In any case, if a reviewable act of an EU institution is not found compatible with the law, under article 264, it will be declared void.|$|E
