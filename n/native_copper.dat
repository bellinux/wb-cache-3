5|$|INGEMMET (Instituto Geológico Minero y Metalúrgico) of Peru {{released}} internally on September 21 {{a report}} on the Carancas meteorite fall. The release of the document to the public was delayed for one week. The researchers found that the fragments from the crater zone had a chondritic texture and the following mineral composition: pyroxene (1) 40%, olivine 20%, feldspar 10%, pyroxene (2) 10%; kamacite 15%, troilite 5%, and traces of chromite and <b>native</b> <b>copper.</b> Kamacite occurs naturally only in meteorites.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{was first}} used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd Century BC. In North America, copper mining began with {{marginal}} workings by Native Americans. <b>Native</b> <b>copper</b> {{is known to have}} been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Continuing {{improvements}} led to {{the furnace}} and bellows and provided, for the first time, the ability to smelt and forge of gold, copper, silver, and lead native metals found in relatively pure form in nature. The advantages of copper tools over stone, bone, and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans, and <b>native</b> <b>copper</b> was probably used from {{near the beginning of}} Neolithic times (about 10 ka). <b>Native</b> <b>copper</b> does not naturally occur in large amounts, but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires. Eventually, the working of metals {{led to the}} discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass (about 4000 BCE). The first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1800 BCE.|$|E

25|$|When {{a mineral}} is broken in a {{direction}} that does not correspond to a plane of cleavage, it is termed to have been fractured. There are several types of uneven fracture. The classic example is conchoidal fracture, like that of quartz; rounded surfaces are created, which are marked by smooth curved lines. This type of fracture occurs only in very homogeneous minerals. Other types of fracture are fibrous, splintery, and hackly. The latter describes a break along a rough, jagged surface; an example of this property is found in <b>native</b> <b>copper.</b>|$|E
25|$|Crystal habit {{refers to}} the overall shape of crystal. Several terms are used to {{describe}} this property. Common habits include acicular, which described needlelike crystals like in natrolite, bladed, dendritic (tree-pattern, common in <b>native</b> <b>copper),</b> equant, which is typical of garnet, prismatic (elongated in one direction), and tabular, which differs from bladed habit in that the former is platy whereas the latter has a defined elongation. Related to crystal form, the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope. Euhedral crystals have a defined external shape, while anhedral crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral.|$|E

5000|$|The Western {{discovery}} of copper in Zambia is owed partly to the celebrated American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, who in 1895 led and oversaw the massive Northern Territories (BSA) Exploration Co. expedition which established that major copper deposits existed in Central Africa. [...] Along the Kafue River in then Northern Rhodesia, Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits {{he had worked}} in the United States, and he encountered <b>natives</b> wearing <b>copper</b> bracelets.

5000|$|<b>Native</b> Americans mined <b>copper</b> in {{and around}} what would later be Houghtonthousands of years before European settlement. [...] "French explorers had noted... its {{existence}} the area {{as early as the}} seventeenth century, in 1772 Alexander Henry had prospected for copper on the Ontonagon River near Victoria." [...] When Horace Greeley said, [...] "Go West, young man" [...] {{he was referring to the}} copper rush in [...] "Michigan's western Upper Peninsula." ...|$|R
25|$|A {{possible}} {{sequence of}} events in prehistory involves considering the structure of copper ore deposits, which are mostly sulphides. The surface minerals would contain some <b>native</b> <b>copper</b> and oxidised minerals, {{but much of the}} copper and other minerals would have been washed further into the ore body forming a secondary enrichment zone. This includes many minerals such as tennantite, with their arsenic, copper and iron. So the surface deposits would be used first, and with some work deeper sulphidic ores would have been uncovered and worked, {{and it would have been}} discovered that the material from this level had better properties.|$|E
500|$|Copper is {{produced}} in massive stars and {{is present in the}} Earth's crust in a proportion of about 50 parts per million (ppm). It occurs as <b>native</b> <b>copper,</b> in the copper sulfides chalcopyrite and chalcocite, in the copper carbonates azurite and malachite, and in the copper(I) oxide mineral cuprite. [...] The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, US. <b>Native</b> <b>copper</b> is a polycrystal, with the largest single crystal ever described measuring 4.4×3.2×3.2cm.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} factor in the colony's economy was copper. Ancient surface copper workings were known at Kansanshi (near Solwezi), Bwana Mkubwa and Luanshya, all on what later became known as the Copperbelt and exploration in 1895 by the British South Africa Company's celebrated American scout, Frederick Russell Burnham, who led and oversaw the massive Northern Territories (BSA) Exploration Co. expedition first established for Westerners that major copper deposits existed in Central Africa. Along the Kafue River in then Northern Rhodesia, Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in the United States, and he encountered <b>natives</b> wearing <b>copper</b> bracelets. Later, the British South Africa Company built towns along the river and a railroad to transport the copper through Mozambique.|$|R

Ahtna now live in several communities around Glennallen. In 1899, the U.S. Army built a pack trail for summer use between the port of Valdez and Eagle, which passed through the Copper River Valley. In the early 20th century, the trail was widened and became the Richardson Highway.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Native</b> Americans mined <b>copper</b> {{from small}} pits on the Keweenaw Peninsula of {{northern}} Michigan {{as early as}} 3000 BC. [...] In the American era, the first successful copper mine, the Cliff mine, began operations in 1845, and many others quickly followed. The last major copper mine in Michigan, the White Pine mine, shut down in 1995, after unsuccessfully applying for a permit to convert the underground mine to an in-situ leaching operation.|$|R
500|$|Copper occurs {{naturally}} {{as native}} metallic copper and {{was known to}} some of the oldest civilizations on record. The history of copper use dates to 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. Evidence suggests that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to follow this sequence: First, cold working of <b>native</b> <b>copper,</b> then annealing, smelting, and, finally, [...] lost-wax casting. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these techniques appear more or less simultaneously {{at the beginning of the}} Neolithic c. 7500 BC.|$|E

A DS3 transported over SONET is encapsulated in a STS-1 SONET channel. An OC-3 SONET link contains three STS-1s, and therefore may carry three DS3s. Likewise, OC-12, OC-48, and OC-192 may carry 12, 48, and 192 DS3s respectively.|$|R

2500|$|The Athabaskan Tradition flourished 1,300–800 years ago. Linguistic {{evidence}} suggests that the Athabaskan culture may have appeared in the Tanana Valley as early as 2,500 years ago. Through ethnography, oral history, and a broad array of cultural items, much has been learned about Athabaskan culture and history in the region. Artifacts associated the Athabaskan culture are exceptionally diverse and include bone and antler projectile points, fishhooks, beads, buttons, birch bark trays, and bone gaming pieces. In the Upper Tanana region, <b>native</b> <b>copper</b> (from trading with Ahtna people or [...] "Copper Indians") was available and used in addition to the traditional material types to manufacture tools such as knives, projectile points, awls, ornaments, and axes. A late prehistoric Athabaskan occupation is recognized at several sites in and around U.S. Army Garrison, Fort Wainwright's training lands. The Athabaskan Tradition includes late prehistoric and proto-historic cultures generally believed to be the ancestors of Athabascan tribes who currently inhabit Interior Alaska. Excavated Athabaskan sites are rare, but the limited body of evidence allows for several generalizations. Athabascan settlement patterns depended greatly on the availability of subsistence resources, and Interior bands lived a nomadic lifestyle.|$|E

5000|$|Native Americans {{were the}} first to mine and work the copper of Lake Superior and the Keweenaw Peninsula of {{northern}} Michigan between 5000 BCE and 1200 BCE. The <b>natives</b> used this <b>copper</b> to produce tools.

6000|$|Amongst our {{followers}} was a [...] "Kázi of the Arabs," [...] one Jabr bin 'Abd el-Nabi, who is {{a manner}} of judge in civil, but not in criminal matters. Before the suit begins the plaintiff, or his surety, deposits a certain sum in coin, corn, or other valuables, and lays his damages at so much. The defendant, if inclined to contest the claim, pays into court the disputed amount, {{and the question is}} settled after the traditional and immemorial customs of the tribe. This man, covetous as any other disciple of Justinian, was exceedingly anxious to obtain the honorarium of a Shaykh, and he worked hard to deserve it. Shortly before our departure from Sharmá, he brought in some scoriae and slag, broken and streaked with copper--in fact, ekvolades. They are thinly scattered over the seaward slope of the left jaw, where the stone nowhere shows a trace of the mineral in situ. As, however, the Expedition had found <b>native</b> <b>copper</b> in three places, more or less near the Jebel el-Abyaz, it was decided that the ore had been brought from the interior.|$|E
6000|$|I take it {{that native}} metals, coal and brick clay, are [...] "mineral products"; and I quite {{believe that they are}} {{properly}} termed [...] "wealth." [...] But when a seam of coal crops out at the surface, and lumps of coal are to be had for the picking up; or when <b>native</b> <b>copper</b> lies about in nuggets, or [171] when brick clay forms a superficial stratum, it appears to me that these things are supplied to, nay almost thrust upon, man without his labour. According to the definition, therefore, they are not [...] "wealth." [...] According to the enumeration, however, they are [...] "wealth": a tolerably fair specimen of a contradiction in terms. Or does [...] "Progress and Poverty" [...] really suggest that a coal seam which crops out at the surface is not wealth; but that if somebody breaks off a piece and carries it away, the bestowal of this amount of labour upon that particular lump makes it wealth; while the rest remains [...] "not wealth"? The notion that the value of a thing bears any necessary relation to the amount of labour (average or otherwise) bestowed upon it, is a fallacy which needs no further refutation than it has already received. The average amount of labour bestowed upon warming-pans confers no value upon them in the eyes of a Gold-Coast negro; nor would an Esquimaux give a slice of blubber for the most elaborate of ice-machines.|$|E
6000|$|We held sundry long confabs with Shaykh Mohammed, {{who seemed}} to know the {{neighbourhood}} unusually well. He declared that there were ruins but no trees at 'Ayn el-Ghadya'n, distant one day's march up the Wady el-'Arabah, and lying near the western wall. This is the place first identified by Robinson, who says nothing about the remains, with Ezion-geber, while Dean Stanley ("Sinai," [...] etc., p. 85) opines {{that we have no}} means of fixing the position of the [...] "Giant's shoulder-blade."[EN#128] Josephus ("Antiq.," [...] viii. 6, 4) places it near Ælana; and the present distance from the sea, like that of Heroopolis (Shaykh el-Ajrúd?) from Suez, may show the rise of the Wady el-'Arabah within historic times. The Shaykh assured us that [...] "Marú" [...] was to be found everywhere among the hills east of El-'Akabah, and Mr. Milne (Beke, p. 405) brought from the very summit of the [...] "true Mount Sinai" [...] (Jebel el-Yitm) a [...] "fine piece of quartz, the same kind of stone as the Brazilian pebbles of which they make the best spectacles." [...] We carried off a specimen of <b>native</b> <b>copper</b> from the Sinaitic Jebel and Wady Raddádí, some six hours to the north-west of the fort: it is found strewed upon the ground but not in veins (?). The stone looked so new that we concluded it to be the work of later generations; and the traces of smelting furnaces at old Elath confirmed the idea.|$|E
50|$|At the {{intersection}} of the Camino del Inca (the longitudinal one) and the routes that crossed the coast of the Altiplano, Calama became the main shelter of the Despoblado of Atacama. Their extensive lands for growing corn and alfalfa give testimony of the high capacity to supply food to the troops of Chasquis and to give tribute to the Inca. In fact, when Diego de Almagro, returning from Cusco, passed by the Calama shelter, the <b>natives</b> gave him <b>copper</b> horseshoes, which were made using a mysterious Incan technique used by towns conquered by the Incas. The science of such a technique still has yet to be explained, but the presence of such horseshoes further suggests strong Incan influence in Prehispanic times.|$|R
50|$|When {{different}} elements are chemically combined, with the atoms {{held together by}} chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds. Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the more common of such <b>native</b> elements are <b>copper,</b> silver, gold, carbon (as coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All {{but a few of}} the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel.|$|R
40|$|Oxidized {{phospholipids}} (oxPL) {{have been}} found in atherosclerotic plaques and have been associated with the development of atherosclerosis. To investigate the LDL modifying effects of oxPL and subsequent consequences for macrophages, murine bone marrow macrophages were treated with LDL modified with the oxidation products of 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -arachidonoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphorylcholine, oxPAPC. Effects of oxPAPC-modified LDL (oxPAPC-LDL) on macrophages were compared to <b>native</b> LDL, <b>copper</b> oxidized LDL (Cu-oxLDL) and acetylated LDL (acLDL). LDL treatment with oxPAPC or CuSO 4 induced active oxidation of the LDL particles, resulting in significant increase in F 2 -isoprostanes, typical for LDL oxidation, compared with native LDL, acLDL or PAPC-LDL. Uptake of oxPAPC-LDL in macrophages was mediated by CD 36 pathways as shown by SR-A and CD 36 inhibitors. Surprisingly, both Cu-oxLDL and acLDL induced cholesterol ester accumulation in macrophages while oxPAPC-LDL did not. Microarray analysis showed a pronounced similarity between Cu-oxLDL and oxPAPC-LDL gene expression induction, whereas acLDL and oxPAPC-LDL did not overlap. The main feature shared by oxPAPC-LDL and Cu-oxLDL was the induction of the glutathione dependent antioxidant response, indicating an important role in protecting against both types of modified LDL induced stress. Our experiments show that oxPL modifies LDL, resulting in a minimally oxidized particle that shares many features of classically copper oxidized LDL and that may have relevant in vivo properties.
