5|$|In August 1963, Mansfield {{decided to}} convert to Catholicism. Although she <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> converted, she did attend Catholic {{services}} {{when she was in}} Europe, and followed Catholic practices when she was involved with a Catholic partner (including Hargitay, Sardelli and Cimber).|$|E
5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter. But he also noted that such estimates depend on many dubious assumptions.|$|E

5|$|However, Samuel Taylor Coleridge {{proposed}} that the three weird sisters {{should be seen as}} ambiguous figures, <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> being called witches by themselves or other characters in the play. Moreover, they were depicted as more fair than foul both in Holinshed's account and in that of contemporary playgoer Simon Forman.|$|E
5|$|However, {{some have}} {{suggested}} that the Moon nonetheless deserves to be called a planet. In 1975, Isaac Asimov noted that the timing of the Moon's orbit is in tandem with the Earth's own orbit around the Sun—looking down on the ecliptic, the Moon <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Cinema Retro {{magazine}} {{hosted a}} screening of the film at Ettington Park. Richard Johnson was a special guest at the event and participated in a Q prior to the screening. Johnson {{said that he had}} <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> stepped foot in the hall during filming, and that this was the first occasion he had actually been inside the premises. The movie was mentioned in Dan Simmons' 2002 novel A Winter Haunting.|$|E

5|$|In a 2016 {{oral history}} of South Park in The Hollywood Reporter, Vernon Chatman, {{the voice of}} Towelie {{as well as a}} writer and {{producer}} on the show said that after Comedy Central censored the episode, series co-creator Trey Parker purchased a ticket to South Africa and showed it {{to the head of the}} network as a threat because Dave Chappelle had fled to Africa, though Parker <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> went.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} the Allies, Austria agreed to send a force to the Kingdom of Naples to depose Murat in February 1815, when it became {{apparent}} that Murat corresponded with Napoleon I, which was explicitly forbidden by a recent treaty. Murat <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> wrote to Napoleon, but Louis, intent on restoring the Neapolitan Bourbons at any cost, forged the correspondence, and subsidised the Austrian expedition with 25million francs.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> played in Northallerton, {{playing at the}} Bluestone Ground near County Hall in Romanby until 1974, then moving to its current {{location}} at the Regency Stadium {{on the outskirts of}} Romanby. The brothers Michael Dawson (Tottenham Hotspur defender), Andy Dawson (Hull City defender) and Kevin Dawson (Worksop Town defender) all started their football career at Northallerton Town.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{originally}} did {{not involve}} Lisa helping Ralph and Bart to brainstorm an idea to alert the penitentiary. The original scene, which Greaney cites {{as one of his}} favorite scenes in the show, despite <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> being in the show, involved Bart, Ralph, and Homer trying to make a plan to save Mayor Quimby.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{interest}} in French authors, Mariano Moreno was not Francophile or afrancesado. He kept a strong Spanish cultural heritage, and both Levene and Abelardo Ramos agree in that his stay in Chuquisaca influenced him more than the books. In line with the Spanish Enlightenment, Moreno kept strong religious beliefs. He removed the chapter from Rousseau's work that is critical of religion, and never became a freemason. He gave up his religious studies to study law and get married, but <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> became a priest, {{so there was no}} defrocking. He studied with priests such as Terrazas, who approved and perhaps even encouraged the change of vocation.|$|E
5|$|Galileo steadfastly {{refused to}} use Marius' names and invented {{as a result}} the {{numbering}} scheme that is still used nowadays, in parallel with proper moon names. The numbers run from Jupiter outward, thus I, II, III and IV for Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto respectively. Galileo used this system in his notebooks but <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> published it. The numbered names (Jupiter x) were used until the mid-20th century when other inner moons were discovered, and Marius' names became widely used.|$|E
50|$|Ijūin was {{elevated}} {{to the title}} of danshaku (baron) in 1907 under the kazoku peerage system, became an admiral on 1 December 1910 and marshal-admiral (fleet admiral) on 26 May 1915, despite <b>never</b> having <b>actually</b> commanded a ship.|$|R

50|$|Sleety Mae Crow's {{death has}} <b>never</b> been <b>actually</b> solved. The young African American {{teenagers}} were fasely accused to justify lynching {{and to get}} the African Americans out of Forsyth County by any means necessary. Sleety Mae Crows' death was collatoral damage which was extremely unfortunate.|$|R
5|$|HMS Blonde was {{the lead}} ship of the her class of scout cruisers built for the Royal Navy {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century. She led the 7th Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet from {{completion}} until 1912. The ship was temporarily assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla before she joined the 4th Battle Squadron in 1913. During the First World War, Blonde was assigned to various battleship squadrons of the Grand Fleet. The ship was converted into a minelayer in 1917, but <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> laid any mines. She was reduced to reserve in 1919 and sold for scrap in 1920.|$|E
5|$|In June 1997, Gallagher married Meg Mathews in Las Vegas, Nevada. He {{had met her}} in 1994 {{through her}} roommate, MTV {{presenter}} Rebecca de Ruvo, whom he was dating {{at the time and}} whom he left for Mathews. Mathews gave birth to a daughter, Anaïs Gallagher, on 27 January 2000. Gallagher and Mathews divorced in January 2001 on grounds of his adultery with Scottish publicist Sara MacDonald. After the divorce was finalised, Gallagher admitted he had only claimed to have cheated in order to speed up the divorce process and that he had <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> been unfaithful.|$|E
5|$|Innovations to the {{mechanical}} clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th. In the 1580s, the Italian polymath Galileo Galilei investigated the regular swing of the pendulum, {{and discovered that}} it could be used to regulate a clock. Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> constructed a clock based on that design. The first pendulum clock was designed and built by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10seconds, very accurate for their time.|$|E

5|$|Nominally {{based in}} Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for {{maintenance}} and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly , has <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that the platform is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the pitch, or field, for {{international}} adult matches is {{in the range of}} 100–110m (110–120yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75m (70–80yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120m (100–130yd) length and 45–90m (50–100yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105m (344ft) long and 68m (223ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> implemented.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{recreational}} opportunities along the Santa Ana River. The Santa Ana River watershed includes {{parts of the}} Cleveland National Forest, San Bernardino National Forest, Angeles National Forest, Mount San Jacinto State Wilderness Area, Chino Hills State Park, and Lake Perris State Recreation Area. Big Bear Lake, Lake Elsinore, and Lake Irvine are popular recreational lakes in the watershed. The river <b>never</b> <b>actually</b> flows through any of these lakes, but they each have drainage to the river via tributaries.|$|E
