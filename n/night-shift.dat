40|$|We have {{examined}} the effect of circadian disturbances induced by night shifts (NSs) on the phenotypes of the tibiae and abdominal adipose tissues (ADTs) in a mouse model by using in vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). We found that the volumes of total and visceral ADTs in the <b>night-shifted</b> group of mice were significantly larger (69 and 92 %, respectively) {{than those in the}} control. The mean polar moment of inertia, cross-sectional thickness, and bone mineral density of the cortical bone in the <b>night-shifted</b> group of mice were less (13, 5, and 3 %, respectively) than those in the control. Moreover, the volume and the thickness of growth plates (GPs) of the tibiae in the <b>night-shifted</b> mice were significantly smaller (22 and 20 %, respectively) than those in the control.

25|$|Robert Donston Stephenson (also {{known as}} Roslyn D'Onston) (20 April 1841 – 9 October 1916) was a {{journalist}} and writer interested in the occult and black magic. He admitted himself as a patient at the London Hospital in Whitechapel shortly before the murders started, and left shortly after they ceased. He authored a newspaper article, which claimed that black magic was the motive for the killings and alleged that the Ripper was a Frenchman. Stephenson's strange manner and interest in the crimes resulted in an amateur detective reporting him to Scotland Yard on Christmas Eve, 1888. Two days later Stephenson reported his own suspect, a Dr Morgan Davies of the London Hospital. Subsequently, he fell under the suspicion of newspaper editor William Thomas Stead. In his books on the case, author and historian Melvin Harris argued that Stephenson was a leading suspect, but the police {{do not appear to}} have treated either him or Dr Davies as serious suspects.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} the prevalence and associated factors of overweight and obesity in Brazilian commercial airline pilots. Methods An observational, cross-sectional study involving 1198 Brazilian commercial airline pilots with a sampling power > 80 % (ß= 20 %) and confidence level of 95 % (α= 5 %) was carried out. The pilots completed an on-line questionnaire collecting data on sociodemographics, work, health, lifestyle and sleep. Poisson regression, with robust variance (stepwise forward technique), {{was employed to}} analyze the factors associated with excess weight (overweight and obesity). The models were adjusted for the variables age, marital status and education. The {{data were analyzed using}} the STATA 12. 0 program. Results: The prevalence of overweight among the pilots was 53. 7 % and of obesity was 14. 6 %. The probability of being overweight was highest among pilots working night shifts for 6 – 10 years and that had difficulty relaxing after work, where perceived morningness was a protective factor. Risk factors for obesity included working <b>night-shifts</b> for 6 – 10 years, having difficulty relaxing after work, sleeping < 6  h on days off, having other diagnosed diseases, and practicing < 150  min/week of physical exercise. Conclusion: It was concluded that the prevalence of overweight and obesity among the commercial airline pilots was high and represents a public health problem in this population. Excess weight was associated with time working <b>night-shifts,</b> difficulty relaxing after work, inadequate sleep on days off, having other chronic diseases, and physical inactivity. In this context, nutritional status can be regarded as the result of dynamic and complex interactions promoted by occupational, sleep and health factors...|$|R

25|$|Oldham {{was once}} a {{thriving}} town, a spearhead of the industrial revolution and {{was said to be}} the cotton spinning capital of the world, producing at its peak some 13% of the entire world's cotton. However, economically, Oldham was very much dependent on this single industry, and following a depression in the British cotton industry due to increased foreign competition and the events of the two world wars, manufacture, affluence and employment opportunities steadily declined in the town {{during the first half of}} the 20th century. As such, Oldham became a relatively impoverished town, inhabited by people with non-transferable skills outside of mill work. In an attempt to keep the industry and the town alive, cotton did however continue to be spun to compete with foreign competition right up until 1989. Although cotton was produced in lesser quantities, it was under increasingly anti-social conditions (<b>night-shifts</b> and harder working conditions) and requiring manpower which was not as readily available as before the Second World War.|$|R

2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{his days in}} the isolation ward, Lukwiya would sit {{with members of the}} WHO, CDC and other medical teams that had set up in the hospital compound to offer assistance and take blood samples that allowed them to map the course of the disease. [...] His main question for them was how to stop his staff members from becoming infected. [...] The likely explanation in most cases are momentary lapses. [...] Health workers at St. Mary's worked 14 hours shifts for weeks in a row while in layers of protective clothing that were stifling in the equatorial country. [...] All that would be required for infection is for a health worker to lose focus for a moment and, after touching a patient, slip a gloved finger under their mask to scratch an itchy nose or rub an eye. [...] One infected St. Mary's health worker who may have been infected in this way was nurse Simon Ajok. [...] In the early morning of 20 November, Ajok was in the Ebola ward and critical, bleeding from both his nose and gums. [...] Fighting to breathe, Ajok pulled off his oxygen mask and coughed violently, sending a fine spray of blood and mucus against the nearby wall. [...] He then astonished and terrified the <b>night-shift</b> by rising to his feet and staggering into the hallway. [...] The night nurse on duty called Dr. Lukwiya for help. [...] Woken out of bed, Lukwiya put on protective clothing, mask, cap, gown, apron and two pairs of gloves, but not goggles or a face shield to protect the eyes. [...] Explanations for this range from grogginess at being newly awoken or haste to reach a colleague that he had helped train. [...] While it will never be known for certain, the care for Simon Ajok, who died one hour after the physician arrived, is the most likely candidate for Lukwiya's infection.|$|E

40|$|Australia’s mining boom Global {{demand for}} {{minerals}} and energy products has fuelled Australia’s recent resources boom and {{has led to}} the rapid expansion of mining projects not only in remote locations but increasingly in settled traditionally agricultural rural areas. A fundamental shift has also occurred in the provisioning of skilled and semi-skilled workers. The huge acceleration in industry demand for labour has been accompanied by the entrenchment of workforce arrangements largely dependent on fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) and drive–in, drive–out (DIDO) non-resident workers (NRWs). While NRWs are working away from their homes, they are usually accommodated in work camps or ‘villages’ for the duration of their work cycle which are normally comprised of many consecutive days of 12 -hour day- and <b>night-shifts.</b> The health effects of this form of employment and the accompanying lifestyle is increasingly becoming contentious. Impacts on personal wellness, wellbeing and quality of life essentially remain under-researched and thus misunderstood. Sodexo in Australia Sodexo began operations in Australia in 1982, and has since become a leader in providing Quality of Life (QOL) services to businesses across the country. The 6, 000 Australian employees are part of a global Sodexo team of 413, 000 people. Sodexo in Australia designs, delivers and manages on-site their QOL services at 320 diverse site locations, including remote sites. Sodexo operates in a range of sectors, including the mining industry. Service plans are tailored to suit the individual needs of organisations. Sodexo Remote Sites has previously conducted unpublished research among mining workers in Australia. The results highlighted needs and expectations of Australian mining workers. Main insights about workers’ requirements were directed towards: •	contacts with closest; •	warm rest time around proper and varied meals; •	additional services to help them better enjoy their life onsite and/or make the most of it; •	organise their transportation; •	promote community living; and •	finding balance between professional and personal life. The brief for this current research is aimed at building upon this knowledge. Research brief Expectations for quality of life and wellness and wellbeing services are increasing dramatically. It's getting costlier and more difficult to retain valuable employees. This is particularly the case in the Australian mining sector. Given the level of interest in ensuring healthy workplaces in Australia, Sodexo has commissioned QUT to conduct a literature review. The objectives as specified by Sodexo are: Objective 1 : To define the concepts of wellness and wellbeing and quality of life in Australia Objective 2 : To examine how wellness and wellbeing are developed within organisations in Australia and how they impact on employee and organizational performance. More specifically, to review the literature that could be sourced about: •	challenges of the mining environment; •	the mining lifestyle – implications for health, wellness and daily life; •	personal health and wellness of Australian mining workers; •	factors affecting health in mines and perceived support for health and wellness; and •	the impact of employer investment in health on perceptions and behaviour of employees. Objective 3 : To determine what impact employee wellness and well-being has on the performance of mining workers. More specifically, to review the literature that could be sourced about: •	impact of obesity, alcohol, tobacco use on companies; and •	links between employee engagement and satisfaction and company productivity. Accordingly this review has attempted to ascertain what factors an organisation should focus on in order to reduce absenteeism and turnover and increase commitment, satisfaction, safety and productivity, with specific reference to the mining industry in Australia. The structure of the report aligns with the stated objectives in that each of the first three parts address an objective.
