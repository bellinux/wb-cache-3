40|$|Antibodies to {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) and HSV- 2 of the {{immunoglobulin}} G (IgG) and IgA isotypes were detected in the cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) of 77 HSV- 1 - and HSV- 2 -seropositive but clinically asymptomatic African women by type-specific enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting (ECL-WB). Of the 77 subjects, 34 were HIV <b>negative,</b> <b>shedding</b> HSV- 2 DNA in their genital secretions; 20 were HIV positive, shedding HSV- 2 DNA; and 23 were HIV negative, not shedding HSV- 2 DNA. HSV-specific IgG was detected in CVS of nearly 70 % of the women studied. HSV-specific IgA was found in CVS of 50 % of the women studied. The distribution of CVS HSV-specific antibodies to each HSV type was highly heterogeneous, with a slight predominance of detectable IgG to HSV- 1 (59 %) over IgG to HSV- 2 (41 %), whereas the frequency of detectable IgA to HSV- 1 (39 %) {{was similar to that}} of IgA to HSV- 2 (36 %). The presence of detectable HSV-specific antibodies was inversely associated with HSV- 2 DNA genital asymptomatic shedding but was not affected by HIV seropositivity. In addition, 13 of 77 (17 %) CVS samples showed neutralizing activity against HSV- 2, as assessed by an HSV- 2 in vitro infectivity reduction assay. Neutralizing activity in CVS was associated with the presence of IgG and/or IgA antibodies to HSV- 1 and/or to HSV- 2 by ECL-WB. Among women whose CVS showed HSV- 2 -neutralizing activity, the specific activity of HSV-specific neutralizing antibodies was substantially (fivefold) higher in HSV- 2 DNA shedders than in nonshedders. In conclusion, HSV-specific antibodies are frequently detected in CVS of asymptomatic African women seropositive for HSV- 1 and HSV- 2. A subset of these women had functional neutralizing activity against HSV- 2 in their CVS. The origin of these antibodies and their role in HSV- 2 disease of the female genital tract remain to be determined...|$|E

We develop a dynamic general equilibrium trade model that explains these phenomena. The model combines standard search frictions in labor markets with heterogeneous firms that experience ongoing productivity shocks. Each period, firms decide whether to exit or continue producing. Those firms that remain active choose their export volumes and adjust their employment levels through vacancy postings or lay-offs. Openness matters in our model because it makes profits more sensitive to productivty shocks, as Rodrik (1997) argued.

40|$|Background The {{trivalent}} oral {{polio vaccine}} (tOPV) produced by Bio Farma consists of three live, attenuated poliovirus serotypes (1, 2, and 3). The tOPV stimulates the formation of secretory IgA (sIgA) on the intestinal wall and lumen. The existence of sIgA is considered giving immunity in the intestines, it could {{prevent the spread of}} viral replication and thus inhibit the transmission of the polio virus. Objective To determine the differences in shedding after each of the first two tOPV immunizations in newborns. Methods This one-way repeated measure study was conducted in newborns from three primary health centers in Bandung, West Java. After administering tOPV to newborns, we assessed the shedding of poliovirus in their stool specimens at 30 days after the first dose and 7 days after the second dose. Data was analyzed using McNemar test with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) to differentiate the shedding of poliovirus after the first and second doses. Results Of 150 children, 128 subjects completed the study. At 30 days after the first tOPV dose, 26 subjects (20. 3 %) were <b>negative</b> for <b>shedding</b> of poliovirus in stool specimens. Of the 102 subjects who had poliovirus isolated from their stools, the serotypes comprised of polio 1 : 10. 9 %, polio 2 : 14. 8 %, polio 3 : 45. 3 %, polio 1 and 3 : 3. 1 %, polio 2 and 3 : 4. 7 %, and polio 1, 2, and 3 : 0. 8 %. At 7 days after the second tOPV dose, there was a significant increase in subjects <b>negative</b> for <b>shedding</b> of poliovirus (78 subjects; 60. 9 %). Statistical analysis revealed significantly decreased shedding of poliovirus in stool specimens {{between the first and second}} doses of tOPV (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The near {{wake of a}} {{flat plate}} is {{investigated}} via direct numerical simulations (DNS). Many earlier experimental investigations have used thin plates with sharp trailing edges and turbulent boundary layers to create the wake. This results in large theta divided by D (sub TE) values (theta is the boundary layer momentum thickness {{towards the end of}} the plate and D (sub TE) is the trailing edge thickness). In the present study the emphasis is on relatively thick plates with circular trailing edges (CTE) resulting in theta divided by D values less than one (D is the plate thickness and the diameter of the CTE), and vigorous vortex shedding. The Reynolds numbers based on the plate length and D are 1. 255 x 10 (sup 6) and 10, 000, respectively. Two cases are computed; one with turbulent boundary layers on both the upper and lower surfaces of the plate (statistically the same, symmetric wake, Case TT) and, a second with turbulent and laminar boundary layers on the upper and lower surfaces, respectively (asymmetric case, Case TL). The data and understanding obtained is of considerable engineering interest, particularly in turbomachinery where the pressure side of an airfoil can remain laminar or transitional because of a favorable pressure gradient and the suction side is turbulent. Shed-vortex structure and phase-averaged velocity statistics obtained in the two cases are compared here. The upper <b>negative</b> <b>shed</b> vortices in Case TL (turbulent separating boundary layer) are weaker than the lower positive ones (laminar separating boundary layer) at inception (a factor 1. 27 weaker in terms of peak phase-averaged spanwise vorticity at first appearance of a peak). The upper vortices weaken rapidly as they travel downstream. A second feature of interest in Case TL is a considerable increase in the peak phase-averaged, streamwise normal intensity (random component) with increasing streamwise distance (x divided by D) that occurs nears the positive vortex cores. This behavior is observed for a few diameters in the near wake. This is counter to Case TT where the peak value essentially decreases with increasing x divided by D. Both these effects are examined in detail and the important contributors are identified...|$|R

In contrast to extensively studied negative constructions in spoken languages, the literature on negative structures in different sign languages (SL) has been scarce. However, recent linguistic analysis of less well studied SLs, such as German SL, Catalan SL, Turkish SL, have contributed to understanding of different ways of conveying negation in languages employing the visual/spatial modality. ^ The current thesis is the first study of sentential negation, negative modals and various negative lexical items in Croatian Sign Language (HZJ), the natural language of the Deaf community in Croatia. I analyzed 120 HZJ sentences elicited from a bilingual, native HZJ signer which provide evidence for two basic negative components involved in expressing sentential negation in HZJ: the manual negative sign NE ‘not’ and the nonmanual side-to-side-headshake.

Resistance against strongylid nematodes {{was associated with}} RAG affection. Hypothesis: Resistance against strongylid nematodes has a genetic basis. The genetic variants influencing strongylid resistance also influence RAG susceptibility. Faecal samples from the half-sibling offspring of two RAG-affected Warmblood stallions 98 offspring from the first family (family 1) and 79 from the second family (family 2) were analysed using a combined sedimentation-flotation method. The phenotype {{was defined as a}} binary trait - either positive or <b>negative</b> for egg <b>shedding.</b> The influence of non-genetic factors on egg shedding was analysed using SAS, the mode of inheritance was investigated using PAP and iBay, and the association between shedding of strongyle eggs and RAG was estimated by odds ratios. Previously established genotypes for 315 microsatellite markers were used for QTL analyses using GRID QTL. The inheritance of "strongylid egg shedding" is influenced by major genes on ECA 15 and ECA 20. Shedding of strongylid eggs is associated with RAG in family 1 but not in family 2. Conclusions: The status of "shedding of strongyle eggs" has a genetic background. The results were inconclusive as to whether "egg shedding" and RAG share common genetic components.

40|$|This thesis explores {{electricity}} as "a {{difference that}} makes a difference," focusing on a textile industry in Nepal. Based on six months of fieldwork in a peri-urban town called Lubhoo, I use {{a particular kind of}} power saving measure as a prism to explore aspects of daily life and work. Colloquially known as load shedding, the power saving measure is institutionalized nationwide by the state electricity corporation and regulates access in predetermined periods, distributed equally between areas. Despite the formally equal electricity supply, there are ways of securing improved access. Electricity supply is therefore not equal in practice, though augmented access comes at significant financial costs. I aim to show that limited access to electricity has a significant influence, both in households and textile factories in Lubhoo. This is especially apparent in the stop-start rhythms of factory production and more broadly in the use of machines and newer technology. Furthermore, the limited electricity supply compounded the (negative) influence of international labor and sales markets, of which Lubhoo is now irrevocably a part. The industry struggled to compete with the popularity of international work migration. This led to unstable labor access in most factories. However, the ability to mitigate the impact of load shedding through improved energy access did enable some owners to keep a more stable workforce. Despite the challenges and frustrations stemming from load shedding, there are some related effects that are not necessarily <b>negative.</b> Load <b>shedding</b> slows down industrial production and thus capital accumulation. I suggest that this could be inhibiting the implementation of harsh industrial labor regimes and a focus on production and profits as a goal in itself. By tracing the impact of load shedding throughout the textile industry and other areas of life, I will show that difference in electricity access does indeed make a difference. However, how the latter plays out depends on factors that are not related to electricity as such. Building on the ethnographic descriptions throughout this thesis, I suggest that electricity may be thought of as "the lifeblood of industrial modernity. " This metaphor can go some way toward exploring the relation between electricity and modern life. Furthermore, with this metaphor in mind, I argue that the conditions in Lubhoo may be characterized, at least in a technological-economic sense, as anemic modernity...|$|R
40|$|The {{perpendicular}} {{interaction of}} a streamwise vortex with an infinite span helicopter blade was modeled experimentally in incompressible flow. Three-component velocity and turbulence measurements were made using a sub-miniature four sensor hot-wire probe. Vortex core parameters (radius, peak tangential velocity, circulation, and centerline axial velocity deficit) were determined as functions of blade-vortex separation, streamwise position, blade angle of attack, vortex strength, and vortex size. The downstream {{development of the}} flow shows that {{the interaction of the}} vortex with the blade wake is the primary cause of the changes in the core parameters. The blade <b>sheds</b> <b>negative</b> vorticity into its wake {{as a result of the}} induced angle of attack generated by the passing vortex. Instability in the vortex core due to its interaction with this negative vorticity region appears to be the catalyst for the magnification of the size and intensity of the turbulent flowfield downstream of the interaction. In general, the core radius increases while peak tangential velocity decreases with the effect being greater for smaller separations. These effects are largely independent of blade angle of attack; and if these parameters are normalized on their undisturbed values, then the effects of the vortex strength appear much weaker. Two theoretical models were developed to aid in extending the results to other flow conditions. An empirical model was developed for core parameter prediction which has some rudimentary physical basis, implying usefulness beyond a simple curve fit. An inviscid flow model was also created to estimate the vorticity shed by the interaction blade, and to predict the early stages of its incorporation into the interacting vortex...|$|R

Much {{of the previous}} work on U. S. job flows {{has been based on}} analysis of the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), which is limited to establishments in the manufacturing sector. The LEEM is the first high-quality, nationwide, comprehensive database for both manufacturing and non-manufacturing that is suitable for measuring annual job flows. We utilize the LEEM data to measure recent gross and net job flows for the entire U. S. economy. We then examine the relationships between firm size, establishment size, and establishment age, and investigate differences resulting from use of two alternative methods for classification of job flows by size of firm and establishment. Cell-based regression analysis is used to help distinguish among the effects of age, firm size, and establishment size on gross and net job flows in existing establishments. We find that gross job flow rates decline with age, and with increasing establishment size when controlling for age differences, whether initial size or mean size classification is utilized. Firm size differences contribute little or nothing additional when establishment size and age are controlled for. However, the relationship of net job growth to business size is very sensitive to the size classification method, even when data and all other methodology are identical. When mean size classification is used, the coefficient on establishment size for net job growth is generally positive, but when initial size is used, this coefficient is <b>negative.</b> These results <b>shed</b> light on some of the apparently conflicting findings in the literature on the relationship between net growth and the size of businesses.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} frameworks for understanding the anomalies of cold and supercooled water postulates the existence of two competing, interconvertible local structures. If the non-ideality in the Gibbs energy of mixing overcomes the ideal entropy of mixing of these two structures, a liquid-liquid phase transition, terminated at a liquid-liquid critical point, is predicted. Various versions of the "two-structure equation of state" (TSEOS) based on this concept have shown remarkable agreement with both experimental data for metastable, deeply supercooled water and simulations of molecular water models. However, existing TSEOSs were not designed to describe the negative pressure region and do not account for the stability limit of the liquid state with respect to the vapor. While experimental data on supercooled water at <b>negative</b> pressures may <b>shed</b> additional light on the source of the anomalies of water, such data are very limited. To fill this gap, we have analyzed simulation results for TIP 4 P/ 2005, one {{of the most}} accurate classical water models available. We have used recently published simulation data, and performed additional simulations, over a broad range of positive and negative pressures, from ambient temperature to deeply supercooled conditions. We show that, by explicitly incorporating the liquid-vapor spinodal into a TSEOS, we are able to match the simulation data for TIP 4 P/ 2005 with remarkable accuracy. In particular, this equation of state quantitatively reproduces the lines of extrema in density, isothermal compressibility, and isobaric heat capacity. Contrary to an explanation of the thermodynamic anomalies of water based on a "retracing spinodal", the liquid-vapor spinodal in the present TSEOS continues monotonically to lower pressures upon cooling, influencing but not giving rise to density extrema and other thermodynamic anomalies.

The tests were performed through an angle-of-attack range of - 5 deg to 28 deg to investigate the effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of roll angle, wing-tail interdigitation, wing deflection, and interference among the components (body, wing, and tail). Theoretical lift and moment characteristics of the configuration and its components were calculated {{by the use of}} existing theoretical methods which have been modified for application to high angles of attack, and these characteristics are compared with experiment. The lift and drag {{characteristics of a}}ll combinations of the body, wing, and tail were independent of roll angle throughout the angle-of-attack range. The pitching-moment characteristics of the body-wing and body-wing- tail combinations, however, were influenced significantly by the roll angle at large angles of attack (greater than 10 deg). A roll from 0 deg (one pair of wing panels horizontal) to 45 deg caused a forward shift in the center of pressure which was of the same magnitude for both of these combinations, indicating that this shift originated from body-wing interference effects. A favorable lift - interference effect (lift of the combination greater than the sum of the lifts of the components) and a rearward shift in the center of pressure from a position corresponding to that for the components occurred at small angles of attack when the body was combined with either the exposed wing or tail surfaces. These lift and center-of-pressure interference effects were gradually reduced to zero as the angle of attack was increased to large values. The effect of wing-tail interference, which influenced primarily the pitching-moment characteristics, is dependent on the distance between the wing trailing vortex wake and the tail surfaces and thus was a function of angle of attack, angle of roll, and wing- tail interdigitation. Although the configuration at zero roll with the wing and tail in line exhibited the least center-of-pressure travel, the configuration with the wing and tail interdigitated had the least change in wing- tail interference over the angle - of-attack range. The lift effectiveness of the variable-incidence wing was reduced by more than 70 percent {{as a result of an}} increase in the combined angle of attack and wing incidence from 0 deg to 40 deg center dot The wing- tail interference (effective downwash at the tail) due to wing deflection was nearly zero as a result of a region of <b>negative</b> vorticity <b>shed</b> from the inboard portion of the wing. The lift characteristics of the configuration and its components were satisfactorily predicted by the calculated results, but the pitching moments at large angles of attack were not because of the influence of factors for which no adequate theory is available, such as the variation of the cross flow drag coefficient along the body and the effect of the wing downwash field on the after body loading...|$|R

The cattle were subdivided into 3 distinct age groups (0 - 30 days old, 4 - 12 months old and 2 - 7 years old). An indirect antigen-capture ELISA and an antibody-detection ELISA as well as geometric mean BCoV antibody titres were used to detect BoCV shed in the faeces and in the nasal secretions, respectively. Relationships between BCoV shedding and age group, seroconversion and clinical signs in cattle were also analysed. The rate of faecal shedding of BoCV was 37. 1 % (13 / 35) in 0 - 30 days old calves, 25. 6 % (10 / 39) in 4 - 12 months old feedlot cattle and 18. 2 % (4 / 22) in 2 - 7 years old cows. The overall rate of BCoV faecal shedding was 28. 1 % (27 / 96) in the cattle examined. Only one animal in the 4 - 12 months old age group was found to shed BoCV nasally. The analysis showed {{that there was a}} significant difference (P < 0. 0001) with respect to faecal shedding between the clinical signs and the age groups. BCoV antibody titre in 50 % of all cattle was ≤ 100 as detected by ELISA while 27. 1 % of the cattle had high titres ranging between 1, 600 and 25, 600. The seroconversion rate was 7. 3 % (7 / 96) in animals shedding BoCV in the faeces and 42. 7 % (41 / 96) in cattle <b>negative</b> for faecal <b>shedding</b> as detected by ELISA, and 20. 8 % of cattle with no seroconversion shed BCoV in the faeces. There was no statistically significant association between seroconversion and nasal or faecal BCoV shedding. These findings confirm the presence of BCoV infections in Turkey. Further studies are needed to isolate BCoV strains in Turkey and to investigate their antigenic and genetic properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the responses of sera from five groups of cattle to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for paratuberculosis by using serum absorbed with Mycobacterium phlei at a single working dilution. The infection status of the cattle was determined by fecal culture. Cattle with different levels of exposure (high versus low prevalence and test negative) and disease manifestation (clinically suspect infection versus subclinical infection) were examined, as follows: (i) two paratuberculosis-negative herds; (ii) a fecal culture-confirmed, clinically suspect cases of paratuberculosis; (iii) cows from a paratuberculosis-infected herd with a high infection rate, as determined by fecal culture, but with no clinical cases at the time of sampling; (iv) cows from three paratuberculosis-infected herds known to have paratuberculosis diagnosed on the farm (low infection rate determined by fecal culture); and (v) one fecal culture-negative herd with known serologically positive cattle. Results generally showed a decreased ELISA response when absorbed rather than nonabsorbed serum from each animal was used. The results of the fecal culture confirmed clinically suspect cases, which were analyzed in relation to the amount of colonies isolated from the animals on fecal culture (0, +, ++,+++, ++++, and above). There was a significant increase in the ELISA response for animals with heavy Mycobacterium paratuberculosis shedding (++++ or above), when both unabsorbed and absorbed sera were used, compared with the response in animals that were fecal culture <b>negative</b> or that <b>shed</b> M. paratuberculosis at lower levels (less than +) (P less than 0. 05). The effects on sensitivity and specificity by using different cutoff points for the five groups of cattle with different levels of exposure is described, since sera were not discretely segregated into distinct groups of positive and negative samples. The specificity of the ELISA in the two fecal culture-negative herds was 100 % at an ELISA cutoff of an optical density (OD) of 0. 1 and above for absorbed serum. For unabsorbed serum the specificity was 62. 9 % at a similar cutoff value. Similarly, the specificity of the fecal culture-negative, serologically positive herd increased from 37. 5 to 72. 2 at an ELISA cutoff value of 0. 1 to 0. 2 (OD) by using absorbed versus unabsorbed serum from 75. 0 to 94. 4 at an ELISA cutoff value of 0. 2 to 0. 3 (OD) ...|$|R
