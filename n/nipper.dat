5|$|Billie <b>Nipper</b> (November 22, 1929 – February 24, 2016) was an American {{artist who}} {{specialized}} in painting portraits of horses. <b>Nipper,</b> a native of Cleveland, Tennessee, painted every horse to win the Tennessee Walking Horse World Grand Championship from 1976 until her death. Besides Tennessee Walking Horses, she painted other breeds of horse, as well as landscapes. Her paintings were made into prints and transferred onto china and other objects. <b>Nipper</b> also bred horses, and her husband and son were horse trainers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nipper</b> was {{inducted}} into the Tennessee Walking Horse Hall of Fame, as well as being inducted into the Tennessee Agriculture Hall of Fame. She was listed in Who's Who by the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association and was given an award for her paintings by the Walking Horse Trainers' Association. In the 1980s, she was selected to paint a horse-themed plate that was given to American president Ronald Reagan who also owned a <b>Nipper</b> painting on canvas. In 1982, her work was displayed in the Fine Arts Pavilion at the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 2012, <b>Nipper</b> painted an ornament that decorated the Christmas tree at the Governor of Tennessee's mansion. <b>Nipper</b> was also commissioned to paint pictures for Zsa Zsa Gabor and Shania Twain.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, <b>Nipper</b> {{began to}} have her oil {{paintings}} made into prints, after getting requests from people who could not afford the originals.|$|E
50|$|Like their Senior counterparts, <b>Nippers</b> {{participate}} in regular competition against other Surf Lifesaving Clubs, at sports carnivals. <b>Nippers</b> {{are able to}} {{participate in}} a variety of Individual and Team events, including beach sprints, Flags, swimming and board races, relays, March Past, etc. Unlike Seniors, <b>Nippers</b> do not compete in surf ski or surf boat races, and they also use shorter Surf Boards than their Senior counterparts. <b>Nippers</b> start to compete when they are in the Under 8s age group.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, about 45 <b>Nippers</b> {{were still}} active, {{mostly in the}} UK. In 2010, 34 <b>Nippers</b> were {{registered}} with the British Civil Aviation Authority, where as of 2017, 19 remained.|$|R

5|$|Despite his numbers, rumors were {{swirling}} {{about his}} weight {{and its effect}} on his knees and his request for a trade out of Chicago. On December 8, Smith, the team's career leader in saves, was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitchers Al <b>Nipper</b> and Calvin Schiraldi. <b>Nipper</b> pitched only 104 more innings in the majors, and Schiraldi was out of baseball before age 30. Smith, meanwhile, registered nearly 300 saves after the trade. The trade started Smith on a journey involving seven teams in eight seasons, which may have hurt his chances in the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nipper</b> {{began to}} study horses {{in an effort to}} portray them more accurately. Her {{father-in-law}} was a professional horse trainer and farrier, and she began painting pictures of him at work.|$|E

5|$|Nipper's husband {{initially}} rode horses as an amateur, but {{he later}} became a professional trainer, as did his and Nipper's son, Joel. Joel <b>Nipper</b> first specialized in Tennessee Walking Horses, but later switched to Racking Horses, a related breed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nipper</b> {{continued}} {{painting for}} her own enjoyment until one Christmas when she gave her father-in-law a painting of his own horse as a gift.

She had many requests and soon began charging for her paintings.|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of mineral wealth on {{other parts of}} the Baie Verte Peninsula led to the sinking of a mine shaft at <b>Nipper's</b> Harbour in the early 1900s. While nearby mining sites, notably Burton's Pond, Bett's Cove, and Tilt Cove, were able to deliver some mineral wealth, <b>Nipper’s</b> Harbour was never able to extract minerals of economic value.|$|R
5|$|<b>Nipper</b> {{was a dog}} born in 1884 who {{was thought}} to be a dog of the Jack Russell terrier type. He was the {{inspiration}} for the painting Dog looking at and listening to a Phonograph, later renamed to His Master's Voice. The painting was used by a variety of music related companies including The Gramophone Company, EMI, and RCA. Today it remains in use incorporated into the logo for HMV in UK and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Drawn and Quarterly {{has become}} known as a house for art comics, {{translations}} of non-English works, like Montrealer Michel Rabagliati's Paul series, and archive editions of classic comics, such as Wright's Little <b>Nipper.</b> The publisher has earned a reputation for the special attention they put into book design, and has played a pivotal rôle in shaping comics' rise in artistic prominence, and in getting comics into mainstream book stores in both Canada and the US. D publisher Chris Oliveros, along with Art Spiegelman, lobbied bookstores to include a section for graphic novels, which would be subdivided by subject.|$|E
5|$|After the Kingdom of Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies on 3 September 1943, the unfinished CB-20 was captured by German forces and completed by March 1944. The boat was then {{handed over to the}} Italian Social Republic where it saw service with the Tenth Flotilla performing reconnaissance and landing saboteurs. At some point between September and October 1944, CB-20 was relocated to its new home port in Pula, where it was captured by the Partisans on 3 May 1945. Renamed Mališan (P-901), translating as <b>nipper</b> in English, the boat was overhauled at the Uljanik Shipyard and commissioned in 1948. The Yugoslav Navy used it for training new submariners as well as evaluating the concept of midget submarines for future use, which eventually materialized {{in the form of the}} Una-class midget submarines three decades later. Depending on the source, the exact time Mališan was decommissioned differs from the early 1950s to 1957.|$|E

25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the <b>nipper</b> jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the <b>nipper</b> jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the <b>nipper</b> jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the <b>nipper</b> jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|E
