We then perform experiments using the sixth <b>finger</b> <b>device</b> with somatosensory feedback during 1  month with varying rest time between sessions, with and without visual feedback. In addition, the sixth <b>finger</b> <b>device</b> is controlled by mirroring the movement of the thumb from the opposite hand, while giving somatosensory feedback from contact information via electrostimulations. From the experimental results, the performance on a reaching task and the modification of self-perception of the controlling finger after each session are evaluated. Finally, we discuss about ability of the brain to adapt to different scenarios and geometries of the body though the evaluations.|$|R

The movement of the device was controlled by the opposite hand thumb and the contact information was conveyed via electric stimulation from the tip of the extra robotic thumb to the tip of the finger controlling the movement.

40|$|In {{this article}} we present a new {{isometric}} input device for multi-fingered grasping in virtual environments. The device was designed to simultaneously assess forces applied by the thumb, index, and middle finger. A mathematical model of grasping, adopted from the analysis of multi-fingered robot hands, was applied to achieve multi-fingered interaction with virtual objects. We used the concept of visual haptic feedback where the user was presented with visual cues to acquire haptic information from the virtual environment. The virtual object corresponded dynamically to the forces and torques applied by the three fingers. The application of the isometric <b>finger</b> <b>device</b> for multi-fingered interaction is demonstrated in four tasks aimed at the rehabilitation of hand function in stroke patients. The tasks include opening the combination lock on a safe, filling and pouring water from a glass, muscle strength training with an elastic torus, and a force tracking task. The training tasks were designed to train patients’ grip force coordination and increase muscle strength through repetitive exercises. The presented virtual reality system was evaluated {{in a group of}} healthy subjects and two post-stroke patients (early post-stroke and chronic) to obtain overall performance results. The healthy subjects demonstrated consistent performance with the <b>finger</b> <b>device</b> after the first few trials. The two post-stroke patients completed all four tasks, however, with much lower performance scores as compared to healthy subjects. The results of the preliminary assessment suggest that the patients could further improve their performance through virtual reality training...|$|R

40|$|The {{selection}} of the right input devices for 3 D interaction methods is important for a successful VR system. While natural direct interaction is often preferred, {{research has shown that}} indirect interaction can be beneficial. This paper focuses on an immersive simulation and training environment, in which one sub-task it is to carefully grasp and move a force-sensitive thin deformable foil without damaging it. In order to ensure transfer of training it was necessary to inform the user of the fact of gentle grasping and moving the foil. We explore the potential of three simple and light-weight interaction methods that each map interaction to a virtual hand in a distinct way. We used a standard tracked joystick with an indirect mapping, a standard <b>finger</b> tracking <b>device</b> with direct mapping based on finger position, and a novel enhanced <b>finger</b> tracking <b>device,</b> which additionally allowed pinch force input. The results of our summative user study show that the task performance did not show a significant difference among the three interaction methods. The simple position based mapping using finger tracking was most preferred, although the enhanced <b>finger</b> tracking <b>device</b> with direct force input offered the most natural interaction mapping. Our findings show that both a direct and indirect input method have potential to interact with force-sensitive thin deformable objects, while the direct method is preferred...|$|R

First, studies {{are performed to evaluate}} the consistency of our test apparatus across the four fingertips and to compare our application of the adaptive thresholding method to the prior work. Next, force detection thresholds for individual fingers are collected and compared to the force detection threshold using four fingers simultaneously.

40|$|To be {{suitable}} {{for the management of}} hypertension, self-measurement of blood pressure (BP) at home should follow international recommendations. The use of accurate and validated measuring devices is an important prerequisite. Upper arm BP monitors are the first choice, while wrist and <b>finger</b> <b>devices</b> cannot be recommended. Measurements should, preferentially, be downloaded from the memory of a device or printed. Reference values have been proposed, but were mostly based on cross-sectional observations and have not yet been widely validated by prospective outcome studies.

Home BP measurement is sometimes recommended as an alternative to ambulatory BP monitoring to diagnose white-coat hypertension. However, home BP measurement cannot replace ambulatory BP monitoring in the diagnosis of hypertension (white-coat), but both techniques have complementary roles. The appropriateness of home BP measurement to guide antihypertensive treatment has only been tested in one large-scale randomized trial: the THOP (Treatment of Hypertension Based on Home or Office Blood Pressure) trial.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of a preceding flexion or extension movement on the static interaction of human finger flexor tendons and pulleys concerning flexion torque being generated. Six human fresh frozen cadaver long fingers were mounted in an isokinetic movement device for the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. During flexion and extension movement both flexor tendons were equally loaded with 40 N while the generated moment was depicted simultaneously at the fingertip. The movement was stopped at various positions of the proximal interphalangeal joint to record dynamic and static torque. The static torque was always greater after a preceding extension movement compared to a preceding flexion movement in the corresponding same position of the joint. This applied for the whole arc of movement of 0 - 105 degrees. The difference between static extension and flexion torque was maximal 11 % in average at about 83 degrees of flexion. Static torque was always smaller than dynamic torque during extension movement and always greater than dynamic torque during flexion movement. The kind of preceding movement therefore showed an influence to the torque being generated in the proximal interphalangeal joint.

40|$|Self-heating {{is one of}} {{the major}} issues of the {{existing}} gallium nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) technology. A significant factor that restricts heat flow from the device channel into the substrate arises from the low thermal conductivity of the aluminum nitride (AlN) nucleation layer that is usually grown between the GaN channel and the foreign substrate to reduce the lattice mismatch between the two materials. The nucleation layer results in a thermal boundary resistance (TBR) which reduces the thermal efficiency of the device by limiting the heat dissipation from the device into the substrate. In this work, a comparison between devices grown on silicon carbide (SiC) wafers from two different manufacturers (one manufacturer claiming very low TBR values) will be shown. The influence of the channel self-heating will be demonstrated using devices with variable gate widths of 10, 100 and 200 microns.
