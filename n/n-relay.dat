We show that in every Gaussian <b>N-relay</b> diamond network, there exists a subset k k+ 1 of k relays which alone provide approximately of the total capacity. The result holds independent {{of the number of}} available relay nodes N, the channel configurations and the operating SNR. The result is tight in the sense that there exists channel configurations for <b>N-relay</b> diamond networks, where every subset k k+ 1 of k relays can provide at most of the total capacity. The approximation is within 3 logN + 3 k bits/s/Hz to the capacity. This result also provides a new approximation to the capacity of the Gaussian <b>N-relay</b> diamond network which is up to a 1 k+ 1 multiplicative gap of and additive gap of 3 logN + 3 k.

We investigate the following question: what fraction of the capacity can we maintain by using only k out of the N available relays? We show that independent of the channel configurations and the operating SNR, we can always find a subset of k relays which alone provide a rate (kC/(k+ 1)) -G, where C is the information theoretic cutset upper bound on {{the capacity of the}} whole network and G is a constant that depends only on N and k (logarithmic in N and linear in k). In particular, for k = 1, this means that half of the capacity of any <b>N-relay</b> diamond network can be approximately achieved by routing information over a single relay. We also show that this fraction is tight: there are configurations of the <b>N-relay</b> diamond network where every subset of k relays alone can at most provide approximately a fraction k/(k+ 1) of the total capacity. These high-capacity k-relay subnetworks can be also discovered efficiently. We propose an algorithm that computes a constant gap approximation to the capacity of the Gaussian <b>N-relay</b> diamond network in O(N log N) running time and discovers a high-capacity k-relay subnetwork in O(kN) running time. This result also provides a new approximation to the capacity of the Gaussian <b>N-relay</b> diamond network which is hybrid in nature: it has both multiplicative and additive gaps. In the intermediate SNR regime, this hybrid approximation is tighter than existing purely additive or purely multiplicative approximations to the capacity of this network.

A key reason for the DMT-optimality of QMF is that quantizing at the noise level suffices to achieve the cut-set bound approximately to within an additive gap, without the requirement of any instantaneous channel state information (CSI). However, DMT only captures the high SNR performance and potentially, limited CSI at the relay can help improve the performance in moderate SNR regimes. In this work we propose an optimization framework for QMF relaying over slow fading channels. Focusing on vector Gaussian quantizers, we optimize the outage probability for the full-duplex single relay by finding the best quantization level according to the available CSI at the relays. For the half-duplex relay channel, we find jointly optimal quantizer distortions and relay schedules using the same framework. Also, for the <b>N-relay</b> diamond network, we derive an universal quantizer that uses only the information of network topology.

40|$|We {{consider}} the Gaussian "diamond" or parallel relay network, {{in which a}} source node transmits a message to a destination node {{with the help of}} N relays. Even for the symmetric setting, in which the channel gains to the relays are identical and the channel gains from the relays are identical, the capacity of this channel is unknown in general. The best known capacity approximation is up to an additive gap of order N bits and up to a multiplicative gap of order N^ 2, with both gaps independent of the channel gains. In this paper, we approximate the capacity of the symmetric Gaussian <b>N-relay</b> diamond network up to an additive gap of 1. 8 bits and up to a multiplicative gap of a factor 14. Both gaps are independent of the channel gains and, unlike the best previously known result, are also independent of the number of relays N in the network. Achievability is based on bursty amplify-and-forward, showing that this simple scheme is uniformly approximately optimal, both in the low-rate {{as well as in the}} high-rate regimes. The upper bound on capacity is based on a careful evaluation of the cut-set bound. We also present approximation results for the asymmetric Gaussian <b>N-relay</b> diamond network.

In ISIT' 12 Brahma, Özgür and Fragouli conjectured that in Gaussian half-duplex diamond networks (i. e., without {{a direct link}} between the source and the destination, and with N non-interfering relays) an approximately optimal relay scheduling policy (i. e., achieving the cut-set upper bound to within a constant gap) has at most N+ 1 active states (i. e., at most N+ 1 out of the 2 ^N possible relay listen-transmit states have a strictly positive probability). Such relay scheduling policies were referred to as simple. In ITW' 13 we conjectured that simple approximately optimal relay scheduling policies exist for any Gaussian half-duplex multi-relay network irrespectively of the topology. This paper formally proves this more general version of the conjecture and shows it holds beyond Gaussian noise networks. In particular, for any memoryless half-duplex <b>N-relay</b> network with independent noises and for which independent inputs are approximately optimal in the cut-set upper bound, an approximately optimal simple relay scheduling policy exists. A convergent iterative polynomial-time algorithm, which alternates between minimizing a submodular function and maximizing a linear program, is proposed to find the approximately optimal simple relay schedule. As an example, for <b>N-relay</b> Gaussian networks with independent noises, where each node in equipped with multiple antennas and where each antenna can be configured to listen or transmit irrespectively of the others, {{the existence of an}} approximately optimal simple relay scheduling policy with at most N+ 1 active states is proved.

The destination combines the received signals from the source and the relays using maximal ratio Combining (MRC).

The use of incremental relaying allows obtaining a higher spectral efficiency. Moreover, the symbol error probability (SEP) performance is enhanced by using MRC at the relays. The use of MRC at the relays implies that each relay overhears the signals from the source and all previous relays and combines them using MRC.

40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>N-relay</b> Gaussian diamond network where a source node communicates to a destination node via N parallel relays through {{a cascade of}} a Gaussian broadcast (BC) and a multiple access (MAC) channel. Introduced in 2000 by Schein and Gallager, the capacity of this relay network is unknown in general. The best currently available capacity approximation, independent of the coefficients and the SNR's of the constituent channels, is within an additive gap of 1. 3 N bits, which follows from the recent capacity approximations for general Gaussian relay networks with arbitrary topology. In this paper, we approximate the capacity of this network within 2 log N bits. We show that two strategies {{can be used to}} achieve the information-theoretic cutset upper bound on the capacity of the network up to an additive gap of O(log N) bits, independent of the channel configurations and the SNR's. The first of these strategies is simple partial decode-and-forward. Here, the source node uses a superposition codebook to broadcast independent messages to the relays at appropriately chosen rates; each relay decodes its intended message and then forwards it to the destination over the MAC channel. A similar performance can be also achieved with compress-and-forward type strategies (such as quantize-map-and-forward and noisy network coding) that provide the 1. 3 N-bit approximation for general Gaussian networks, but only if the relays quantize their observed signals at a resolution inversely proportional to the number of relay nodes N. This suggest that the rule-of-thumb to quantize the received signals at the noise level in the current literature can be highly suboptimal.

Exact symbol-error-rate (SER) expressions for an arbitrary N-node network employing ’ary phaseshift-keying (MPSK) modulation or quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) are provided for the proposed class of protocols. Further, approximate expressions for the SER are derived and shown to be tight at high enough signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our analysis reveals an interesting result: The class of cooperative protocols shares the same asymptotic performance at high enough SNR and does not depend on m, the number of previous nodes involving in coherent detection, hence, the asymptotic performance of a simple cooperative scenario in which each relay combines the signals from the source and the previous relay is exactly the same as that for a much more complicated scenario in which each relay combines the signals from the source and all the previous relays. The theoretical results also confirm that full diversity equal to the number of cooperating nodes is indeed achievable by the proposed protocols. Finally, we formulate a power-allocation problem in order to minimize the SER of the system. The analysis shows that the optimum power allocation at different nodes follows a certain ordering, and that the power-allocation scheme at high SNR does not depend on the channel quality of the direct link between the source and the destination.

More specifically, we show that for <b>N-relay</b> Gaussian networks with an arbitrary topology, routing can in the worst case guarantee an approximate fraction 1 / N/ 2 + 1 of the capacity of the full network, independently of the SNR regime. We prove that this guarantee is fundamental, i. e., it is the highest worst-case guarantee that we can provide for routing in relay networks.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} a Gaussian relay network where a source transmits {{a message to}} a destination {{with the help of}} N half-duplex relays. The information theoretic cut-set upper bound to the capacity is shown to be achieved to within 1. 96 (N + 2) bits by noisy network coding, thereby reducing the previously known gap. This gap is obtained as a special case of a more general constant gap result for Gaussian half-duplex multicast networks. It is then shown that the generalized Degrees-of-Freedom of this network is the solution of a linear program, where the coefficients of the linear inequality constraints are proved to be the solution of several linear programs referred as the assignment problem in graph theory, for which efficient numerical algorithms exist. The optimal schedule, that is, the optimal value of the 2 N possible transmit-receive configuration states for the relays, is investigated and known results for diamond networks are extended to general relay networks. It is shown, for the case of N = 2 relays, that only N + 1 = 3 out of the 2 N = 4 possible states have a strictly positive probability and suffice to characterize the capacity to within a constant gap. Extensive experimental results show that, for a general <b>N-relay</b> network with N ≤ 8, the optimal schedule has at most N + 1 states with a strictly positive probability. As an extension of a conjecture presented for diamond networks, it is conjectured that this result holds for any HD relay network and any number of relays. Finally, a network with N = 2 relays is studied in detail to illustrate the channel conditions under which selecting the best relay is not optimal, and to highlight the nature of the rate gain due to multiple relays.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} network {{simplification}} {{problem in the}} context of Gaussian Half-Duplex (HD) diamond networks. Specifically, given an <b>N-relay</b> diamond network, this problem seeks to derive fundamental guarantees on the capacity of the best k-relay subnetwork, {{as a function of the}} full network capacity. The main focus of this work is on the case when k=N- 1 relays are selected out of the N possible ones. First, a simple algorithm, which removes the relay with the minimum capacity (i. e., the worst relay), is analyzed and it is shown that the remaining (N- 1) -relay subnetwork has an approximate (i. e., optimal up to a constant gap) HD capacity that is at least half of the approximate HD capacity of the full network. This fraction guarantee is shown to be tight if only the single relay capacities are known, i. e., there exists a class of Gaussian HD diamond networks with N relays where, by removing the worst relay, the subnetwork of the remaining k=N- 1 relays has an approximate capacity equal to half of the approximate capacity of the full network. Next, this work proves a fundamental guarantee, which improves over the previous fraction: there always exists a subnetwork of k=N- 1 relays that achieves at least a fraction N- 1 /N of the approximate capacity of the full network. This fraction is proved to be tight and it is shown that any optimal schedule of the full network can be used by at least one of the N subnetworks of N- 1 relays to achieve a worst-case performance guarantee of N- 1 /N. Additionally, these results are extended to derive lower bounds on the fraction guarantee for general k ∈ [1 :N]. The key steps in the proofs lie in the derivation of properties of submodular functions, which provide a combinatorial handle on the network simplification problem in Gaussian HD diamond networks...|$|E
