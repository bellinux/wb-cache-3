5|$|In 1989 Manning {{directed}} the Belvoir St Theatre {{production of a}} play, Black Cockatoos, {{about the relationship between}} a white woman and an Aboriginal man. The script (not by Manning) was criticised by reviewer Angela Bennie, who nevertheless described Manning's direction as delicate and perceptive in places, if also <b>naive</b> <b>and</b> self-conscious.|$|E
5|$|Zampanò {{makes his}} living as an {{itinerant}} street performer, entertaining crowds by breaking an iron chain bound tightly across his chest, then passing the hat for tips. In short order, Gelsomina's <b>naïve</b> <b>and</b> antic nature emerges, with Zampanò's brutish methods presenting a callous foil. He teaches {{her to play}} the snare drum and trumpet, dance a bit, and clown for the audience. Despite her willingness to please, he relies on intimidation and even cruelty at times to maintain his domination.|$|E
5|$|In Half-Life 2, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of Dr. Gordon Freeman. Throughout the game, the player follows the story of a dark, dystopian future in which mankind has been enslaved by the Combine, a mysterious alien enemy. In contrast, Concerned follows the same general path through the story {{established}} by Half-Life 2, but instead follows the adventures of Gordon Frohman, a hapless, lethally clumsy oaf who arrives in City 17 a few weeks before Freeman. Frohman is incredibly <b>naïve</b> <b>and,</b> unlike the other citizens, seems to enjoy living under the rule of the totalitarian administrator, Dr. Breen, and the Combine. He holds an insane reverence for the latter, even going to the point of having a plush doll of a Combine soldier.|$|E

5|$|SpongeBob is {{depicted}} as being a good-natured, optimistic, <b>naïve,</b> <b>and</b> enthusiastic yellow sea sponge residing in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom alongside an array of anthropomorphic aquatic creatures. He works as a fry cook at a local fast food restaurant, the Krusty Krab, to which he is obsessively attached. At work, SpongeBob answers to Eugene Krabs, a greedy crab who shows SpongeBob favor, alongside his ill-tempered, snobbish next-door neighbor Squidward Tentacles. His hobbies include jellyfishing, practicing karate at an elementary level, and blowing bubbles.|$|E
5|$|While each façade of Quattro Canti is {{pleasing}} to the eye, as a scheme {{it is both}} out of proportion with the limited size of the piazza and, like most other examples of early Sicilian Baroque, can be considered provincial, <b>naive</b> <b>and</b> heavy-handed, compared with later developments. Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E
5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little <b>naive</b> <b>and</b> dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of Pathfinder Associative Networks in assessing knowledge structures for people who learn information via computer-based tutorials. Graphical representations {{for a set of}} concepts were produced for participants who had completed a computer-based tutorial related to the concepts (novices) and for those who had no tutorial (naives). Thirty undergraduates were randomly assigned to be novices or <b>naives,</b> <b>and</b> 9 faculty and professional staff members volunteered to be experts. These graphs were then compared to graphical representations generated by experts. Comparing graphs revealed that the <b>naives</b> <b>and</b> novices were the most similar groups. However, the differences that occurred between the two groups were indicative of the fact that novices were becoming more similar to experts.

5|$|The Sicilian Baroque style came to {{fruition}} during a major surge of rebuilding following the massive earthquake in 1693. Previously, the Baroque style {{had been used}} on the island in a <b>naïve</b> <b>and</b> parochial manner, having evolved from hybrid native architecture rather than being derived from the great Baroque architects of Rome. After the earthquake, local architects, many of them trained in Rome, were given plentiful opportunities to recreate the more sophisticated Baroque architecture that had become popular in mainland Italy; the work of these local architects — and the new genre of architectural engravings that they pioneered — inspired more local architects to follow their lead. Around 1730, Sicilian architects had developed a confidence {{in their use of}} the Baroque style. Their particular interpretation led to further evolution to a personalised and highly localised art form on the island. From the 1780s onwards, the style was gradually replaced by the newly fashionable neoclassicism.|$|E

25|$|Most {{scholars}} today {{consider all}} such theories {{not so much}} wrong— they occasionally offer peripheral insights— as comically <b>naïve</b> <b>and</b> irrelevant.

25|$|One of {{the first}} essays advocating a blinded {{approach}} to experiments in general came from Claude Bernard {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century, who recommended splitting any scientific experiment between the theorist who conceives the experiment and a <b>naive</b> (<b>and</b> preferably uneducated) observer who registers the results without foreknowledge of the theory or hypothesis being tested. This suggestion contrasted starkly with the prevalent Enlightenment-era attitude that scientific observation can only be objectively valid when undertaken by a well-educated, informed scientist.|$|E
25|$|It was {{formerly}} common in American English {{to use a}} diaeresis mark to indicate a hiatus: for example, coöperate, daïs, reëlect.

Nowadays the diaeresis is normally left out (cooperate), or a hyphen is used (co-operate) if the hiatus is between two morphemes in a compound word. It is, however, still common in monomorphemic loanwords such as <b>naïve</b> <b>and</b> Noël.|$|E
