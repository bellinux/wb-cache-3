The interaction of H. pylori VacA toxin and ammonia (produced by H. pylori urease) with partly polarized gastric MKN 28 cells in culture was investigated at neutral and moderately acidic pH (6. 2, compatible with cell viability) by means of <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> dye <b>uptake</b> and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry.

In addition, acidic pH blocked endosomal internalization of H. pylori outer membrane vesicles, a convenient indicator of endocytosis. Our data raise the possibility that suppression of gastric acid may increase H. pylori-induced gastric damage by enhancing epithelial internalization of H. pylori virulence factors through activation of endocytosis.

However, toxin does not form large, neutral red-positive vacuoles unless combined with ammonia, whose moderate vacuolating activity is markedly potentiated by the toxin. It is concluded that the toxin accumulated within the endosomal compartment alters the morphology and function of this organelle and plays a permissive role towards cell vacuolation, possibly by increasing the accumulation of protonated ammonia within endosomes.

The clinical usefulness of chemotherapeutic agents containing the platinum moiety is often limited by their nephrotoxicity.

Protein synthesis was the earliest indicator of toxicity, followed by NR uptake and MTT conversion. Fluorescent probes for lysosomes (acridine orange) and mitochondria (rhodamine 123) confirmed that cisplatin's toxicity to RPTCs was delayed and cumulative. Condensation of nucleolar components and fragmentation of RER were observed in RPTCs treated for as little as two hours. Since the nucleolus is the site of ribosome biogenesis, the early inhibition of protein synthesis by cisplatin may arise from disruption of this region.

We found that BA significantly enhanced the thymus and spleen indices, and stimulated lymphocyte proliferation induced by Concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide as shown by MTT assay. Flow cytometry revealed that BA increased the percentage of CD 4 + cells in thymus as well as the percentage of CD 19 + and the ratios of CD 4 +/CD 8 + in spleen.

40|$|Although the {{sesquiterpene}} lactone thapsigargin {{has been}} shown to possess hyperplastic and tumor-promoting activities when applied topically to mouse skin in vivo, the cellular mechanism(s) which underlie these effects are unclear. We show here that thapsigargin treatment of primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes increased intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration (Cai) in a concentration-dependent manner. Thapsigargin induced a rapid, transient elevation in keratinocyte Cai, in part due to the release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores. This response was followed by a sustained elevation in Ca 2 +, resulting entirely from calcium influx. Thapsigargin elicited a biphasic effect on keratinocyte DNA synthesis: a rapid inhibitory effect (50 – 60 % inhibition at 4 – 8 h), followed by a very marked and sustained elevation. Prolonged treatment of keratinocytes with thapsigargin at relatively high concentrations resulted in cytotoxicity (inhibition of <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> <b>uptake).</b> The rapid antiproliferative effect of thapsigargin was not associated with cytotoxicity, as determined by either <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> <b>uptake</b> or by trypan blue exclusion, and was not blocked by pretreatment with Ro 31 – 7549, a selective inhibitor of protein kinase C. The rapid antiproliferative effect of thapsigargin was associated with rapid, transient activation of keratinocyte c-fos expression and rapid inhibition of total protein synthesis.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{tributyltin}} (TBT) on circulating {{cells from the}} clam Tapes philippinarum were investigated in order to set up quick and reproducible in vitro bioassays to evaluate TBT toxicity in bivalve molluscs. Haemocytes, collected from adductor muscle of clams, were exposed for 60 min at 25 °C to sublethal concentrations of TBT (0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 1 µM) and the effects on <b>Neutral</b> <b>Red</b> <b>uptake,</b> and both superoxide dismutase and lysozyme activities were spectrophotometrically evaluated. Exposure of cells to 0. 05 µM TBT caused significant increase (P < 0. 05) in <b>Neutral</b> <b>Red</b> <b>uptake</b> compared to controls, whereas no differences resulted after exposure to 0. 01 and 0. 1 µM TBT. Enlarged lysosomes were observed in haemocytes exposed to 0. 05 µM TBT. Moreover, in haemocytes treated with 0. 05 and 0. 1 µM TBT SOD activity exhibited a significant decrease (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 01, respectively) with respect to controls. A significant decrease in lysozyme activity was also observed in haemocytes exposed to 0. 05 (P < 0. 01) and 0. 1 µM TBT (P < 0. 001). These results suggest a relationship between TBT exposure and alterations in functional responses of haemocytes in T. philippinarum. Proposed assays result sensitive, rapid and reproducible. They can be proposed as biomarkers, even though their responsiveness {{needs to be more}} fully evaluated in haemocytes collected after clam exposure in laboratory and field conditions...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{efficacy of}} Viburnum foetens (V. foetens) extracts against different cancer lines. Methods: The crude extract and fractions of V. foetens are evaluated against MDA MB- 468 and Caco- 2 cancer cell lines by using MTT (3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 -thiazolyl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H-tetrazolium bromide) assays. These extracts are also tested against breast carcinoma and human colon adenocarcinoma through NRU (<b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> <b>uptake)</b> assay. Results: The crude extract inhibited the cancerous cell growth in a dose dependent manner. From the MTT assay {{it is obvious}} that the ethylacetate fraction significantly inhibited the growth of Caco- 2 (93. 44...|$|E
40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} oncoprotein, p 53, is {{a critical}} regulator of stress-induced growth arrest and apoptosis. p 53 activity is regulated through the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) with stress-induced disruption leading to increased accumulation of p 53, resulting in growth arrest. In the present study, we investigate the role of p 53 to determine sensitivity to cadmium (Cd) and whether induction of stress signaling responses and perturbation of the UPS are involved in Cd-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. We treated synchronously cultured p 53 transgenic mouse embryonic fibroblasts, both wild-type p 53 +/+ and knockout p 53 −/− cells, with cadmium chloride (Cd, 0. 5 – 20 μM) for 24 h. Cd-induced cytotoxicity was assessed by cellular morphology disruption and <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> dye <b>uptake</b> assay. Proteins in the stress signaling pathway, including p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK); ubiquitination, such as high-molecular weight of polyubiquitinated proteins (HMW-polyUb); and apoptotic pathways, were all measured. We found that Cd induced p 53 -dependent cytotoxicity in the p 53 +/+ cells, which exhibited a twofold greater sensitivity. We observed a dose-dependent stimulation of p 38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation that corresponded to accumulation of HMW-polyUb conjugates and lead to the induction of apoptosis, {{as evidenced by the}} elevation of cleaved caspase- 3. Our study suggests that Cd-mediated cytotoxicity and induction of stress signaling responses, elevated accumulation of HMW-polyUb conjugates, and resulting apoptosis are all dependent on p 53 status...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{series of}} {{cyclopentane}} derivatives {{have been found}} to exhibit potent and selective inhibitory effects on influenza virus neuraminidase. These compounds, designated RWJ- 270201, BCX- 1827, BCX- 1898, and BCX- 1923, were tested in parallel with zanamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate against a spectrum of influenza A (H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2, and H 5 N 1) and influenza B viruses in MDCK cells. Inhibition of viral cytopathic effect ascertained visually and by <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> dye <b>uptake</b> was used, with 50 % effective (virus-inhibitory) concentrations (EC 50) determined. Against the H 1 N 1 viruses A/Bayern/ 07 / 95, A/Beijing/ 262 / 95, A/PR/ 8 / 34, and A/Texas/ 36 / 91, EC 50 s (determined by <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> assay) of the novel compounds were ≤ 1. 5 μM. Twelve strains of H 3 N 2 and two strains of avian H 5 N 1 viruses were inhibited at < 0. 3 μM. Influenza B/Beijing/ 184 / 93 and B/Harbin/ 07 / 94 viruses were inhibited at < 0. 2 μM, with three other B virus strains inhibited at 0. 8 to 8 μM. The novel inhibitors were comparable in potency to (or slightly more potent than) zanamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate. No cytotoxicity was seen with the compounds at concentrations of ≤ 1 mM in cell proliferation assays. The antiviral activity of RWJ- 270201, chosen for clinical development, was studied in greater detail. Its potency and that of oseltamivir carboxylate decreased with increasing multiplicity of virus infection. Time-of-addition studies indicated that treatment with either compound needed to begin 0 to 12 h after virus exposure for optimal activity. Exposure of cells to RWJ- 270201 caused most of the virus to remain cell associated, with extracellular virus decreasing in a concentration-dependent manner. This is consistent with its effect as a neuraminidase inhibitor. RWJ- 270201 shows promise in the treatment of human influenza virus infections...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{development}} of highly inspired biomaterials with multi-functional characteristics has gained considerable attention, especially in biomedical, and other health-related areas of the modern world. It is well-known {{that the lack of}} antibacterial potential has signiﬁcantly limited biomaterials for many challenging applications such as infection free wound healing and/or tissue engineering etc. In this perspective, herein, a series of novel bio-composites with natural phenols as functional entities and keratin-EC as a base material were synthesised by laccase-assisted grafting. Subsequently, the resulting composites were removed from their respective casting surfaces, critically evaluated for their antibacterial and biocompatibility features and information is also given on their soil burial degradation profile. In-situ synthesised phenol-g-keratin-EC bio-composites possess strong anti-bacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains i. e., B. subtilis NCTC 3610, P. aeruginosa NCTC 10662, E. coli NTCT 10418 and S. aureus NCTC 6571. More specifically, 10 HBA-g-keratin-EC and 20 T-g-keratin-EC composites were 100 % resistant to colonisation against all of the aforementioned bacterial strains, whereas, 15 CA-g-keratin-EC and 15 GA-g-keratin-EC showed almost negligible colonisation up to a variable extent. Moreover, at various phenolic concentrations used, the newly synthesised composites remained cytocompatible with human keratinocyte-like HaCaT, as an obvious cell ingrowth tendency was observed and indicated by the <b>neutral</b> <b>red</b> dye <b>uptake</b> assay. From the degradation point of view, an increase in the degradation rate was recorded during their soil burial analyses. Our investigations could encourage greater utilisation of natural materials to develop bio-composites with novel and sophisticated characteristics for potential applications...|$|R
