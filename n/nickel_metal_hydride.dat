25|$|Old {{rechargeable}} batteries self-discharge {{more rapidly than}} disposable alkaline batteries, especially nickel-based batteries; a freshly charged nickel cadmium (NiCd) battery loses 10% of its charge in the first 24 hours, and thereafter discharges {{at a rate of}} about 10% a month. However, newer low self-discharge <b>nickel</b> <b>metal</b> <b>hydride</b> (NiMH) batteries and modern lithium designs display a lower self-discharge rate (but still higher than for primary batteries).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{investigation}} of gas recombination in a positive-limited-sealed Ni-MHx cell. The positive electrodes were prepared by electrochemical impregnation of fibrous <b>nickel</b> plaques. The <b>metal</b> <b>hydride</b> negative electrodes {{were made by}} pasting the mixture of rare-earth hydrogen storage alloy powders, conducting and binding agents on foamed nickel substrates. The measurement of the positive capacity at different charge times was used to estimate the partial current for oxygen evolution at the same time. The effects of charge rate, electrolyte saturation level and initial state of charge of the positive electrodes on the recombination were investigated in sealed Ni-MHx cells. By determining the differential capacity of nickel hydroxide electrodes, an improved mathematical model {{was used to evaluate}} the gas recombination parameters during charge, overcharge, rest and discharge of the positive-limited-sealed Ni-MHx cell. The gas recombination during rest, discharge and overdischarge was also examined. The oxygen recombination on the nickel hydroxide electrodes can be neglected due to the consumption of water when the nickel hydroxide electrodes were discharged. The longer overdischarge produced an increase in cell pressure for the sealed Ni-MHx cell at an electrolyte unsaturated level and the evolving gas can be recombined by a following recharge operation...|$|R
40|$|Transparent {{thin films}} of copper(I) oxide {{prepared}} on conductive SnO 2 :F glass substrates by anodic oxidation of sputtered copper films or by direct electrodeposition of Cu 2 O transformed reversibly to opaque metallic copper films when reduced in alkaline electrolyte. In addition, the same Cu 2 O films transform reversibly to black copper(II) oxide when cycled at more anodic potentials. Copper oxide-to-copper switching covered a large dynamic range, from 85 % and 10 % photopic transmittance, with a coloration efficiency of about 32 cm 2 /C. Gradual {{deterioration of the}} switching range occurred over 20 to 100 cycles. This is tentatively ascribed to coarsening of the film and contact degradation caused by the 65 % volume change on conversion of Cu to Cu 2 O. Switching between the two copper oxides (which have similar volumes) was more stable and more efficient (CE = 60 cm 2 /C), but covered a smaller transmittance range (60 % to 44 % T). Due to their large electrochemical storage capacity and tolerance for alkaline electrolytes, these cathodically coloring films may be useful as counter electrodes for anodically coloring electrode films such as <b>nickel</b> oxide or <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> are {{promising}} candidates for H 2 storage, but high stability and poor kinetics are the important challenges which {{have to be}} solved for vehicular applications. Most of recent experimental reports for improving thermodynamics of <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> have been focused on lowering reaction enthalpies of a <b>metal</b> <b>hydride</b> by mixing other compounds. However, finding out <b>metal</b> <b>hydride</b> mixtures satisfying favorable thermodynamics among {{a large number of}} possible <b>metal</b> <b>hydride</b> mixtures is inefficient and thus a systematic approach is required for an efficient and rigorous solution. Our approaches introduced in this thesis allow a systematic screening of promising <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> or their mixtures from all possible <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> and their mixtures. Our approaches basically suggest two directions for improving <b>metal</b> <b>hydride</b> thermodynamics. First, our calculations for examining the relation between the particle size of simple <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> and thermodynamics of their decomposition reactions provide that the relation would depend on the total surface energy difference between a <b>metal</b> and its <b>hydride</b> form. It ultimately suggests {{that we will be able}} to screen <b>metal</b> <b>hydride</b> nanoparticles having favorable thermodynamics from all possible <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> by examining the total surface differences. Second, more importantly, we suggest that our thermodynamic calculations combined with the grand canonical linear programming method and updated database efficiently and rigorously screen potential promising bulk <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> and their mixtures from a large collection of possible combinations. The screened promising <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> and their mixtures can release H 2 via single step or multi step. Our additional free energy calculations for a few selected promising single step reactions and their metastable paths show that we can identify the most stable free energy paths for any selected reactant mixtures. In this thesis, we also demonstrate that a total free energy minimization method can predict the possible evolution of impurity other than H 2 for several specified mixtures. However, it is not ready to predict reaction thermodynamics from a large number of compounds. Ph. D.

Within the field, <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> have become a prominent focus of research due to their large hydrogen storage capacity and relative system simplicity and safety. <b>Metal</b> <b>hydride</b> heat pumps constitute one such application, in which heat and hydrogen are transferred to and from <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides.</b> While {{a significant amount of}} work has been done to study such systems, the scope of materials selection has been quite limited.

The material database contains over 300 <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> with various physical and thermodynamic properties included for each material. Sub-models for equilibrium pressure, thermophysical data, and default properties are used to predict the behavior of each material within the given system. For a given thermal system, this tool can be used to identify optimal materials out of over 100, 000 possible hydride combinations. ^ The selection tool described herein has been applied to a stationary combined heat and power system containing a high-temperature proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, a hot water tank, and two <b>metal</b> <b>hydride</b> beds used as a heat pump. A variety of factors can be used to select materials including efficiency, maximum and minimum system pressures, pressure difference, coefficient of performance (COP), and COP sensitivity. ^ The targeted down-selection of <b>metal</b> <b>hydrides</b> for this system focuses on the systemâ€™s COP for each potential pair. The values of COP and COP sensitivity have been used to identify pairs of highest interest for use in this application. The <b>metal</b> <b>hydride</b> component design tool developed in this work selects between <b>metal</b> <b>hydride</b> materials on an unprecedented scale. It can be easily applied to other hydrogen-based thermal systems, making it a powerful and versatile tool. ...|$|R
