40|$|Ten {{patients}} with {{iron deficiency anemia}} were given intravenous injections of colloidal saccharated iron oxide (a preparation temporarily named "Ferricol"). The observed hematologic responses and toxic reactions were as follows : 1) This iron preparation has an intense hematopoietic effect, particularly to cases with uncomplicated iron deficiency anemia. In almost all cases studied, the highest reticulocyte count occurred five to six days after the first injection. The maximal hemoglobin regeneration was 0. 271 g/dl/ 24 h., while the minimal was 0. 094 g (mean 0. 169 g). 2) No significant side-reaction was noted, {{so long as the}} dosis of the preparation did not exceed 50 - 100 mg per day, and the speed of injection was not too rapid. <b>No</b> <b>cumulation</b> symptom was observed when the total dosis did not exceed approximately 3 g...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} potency, time-course {{of action}} and cardiovascular effects of Org NC 45, a new non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, have been {{compared with those of}} pancuronium, aJcuronium and tubocurarine in 64 anaesthetized patients. The relative potency (ED 60) to Org NC 45 was 1. 74, 3. 69 and 8. 57 respectively. In doses which caused useful surgical relaxation, duration of action of Org NC 45 was 34 %, 39 % and 26 % that of pancuronium, alcuronium and tubocurarine. After administration of repeated doses <b>no</b> <b>cumulation</b> was seen for Org NC 45. The new drug was free from any effect on arterial pressure and heart rate. Org NC 45, the monoquaternary homologue of pancuronium, is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. It was shown to be a short-acting drug with fast onset of action. The absence of the acetyl-choline-like fragment in the A-ring of the molecule made it devoid of vagolytic action while the preserva-tion of the D-ring configuration contributed to the maintenance of strong curariform potency (Buckett...|$|R
40|$|To examine {{pharmacokinetics}} {{and tolerance}} of long term administration of olsalazine (azodisalicylate), increasing {{doses of the}} drug were given for one year to 31 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and nine patients with Crohn's colitis (CC), refractory to, or intolerant of sulphasalazine, until sustained remission was obtained or a maximum of 4 g/day was reached. Colonic drug metabolism was studied by equilibrium in vivo dialysis of faeces. Complete azoreduction occurred in most cases. Concentrations of 5 -aminosalicylic acid, but not N-acetyl- 5 -aminosalicylic acid, in faecal dialysates increased dose dependently. Serum concentrations disclosed <b>no</b> <b>cumulation</b> {{in the long term}} and olsalazine was well tolerated, although loose stools occurred transiently in some patients with extensive disease: this was associated with a larger proportion of unsplit olsalazine in the faecal dialysates. Patients with ulcerative colitis having a high prostaglandin E 2 concentration (greater than ng/ml) determined by equilibrium dialysis of rectum, were less likely to benefit from treatment. Olsalazine is a very effective means of delivery of 5 -aminosalicylic acid to the colonic mucosa in active disease.

40|$|The use of neuromuscular {{blockade}} in {{the intensive}} therapy unit (ITU) is controversial: many clinicians {{are concerned about the}} risk of awareness when the patient is paralysed, and of accidental disconnection from the ventilator (Willatts, 1985). However, there is evidence which suggests that neuromuscular blockade may be beneficial in the management of certain condi-tions, notably adult and neonatal respiratory dis-tress syndrome (Pollitzer et al., 1981; Greenough et al., 1984), tetanus (Edmondson and Flowers, 1979) and head injury (McDowall, 1983). Surveys of intensive therapy units suggest that the use of neuromuscular blocking agents is widespread (Miller-Jones and Williams, 1980; Merriman, 1981). However, there are very few data on the appropriateness of the individual agents in the ITU, and choices have been based largely on experience gained in the operating theatre. The requirements for the ideal drug would include good cardiovascular stability, lack of histamine release, <b>no</b> <b>cumulation,</b> and a means of elimination which is independent of hepatic and renal function. It is important that the neuro-muscular blockade can be antagonized easily and rapidly when required, to permit assessment of the patient and for weaning from mechanical ventilation—even in the presence of multiple organ failure. In addition, the drug should be suitable for administration by infusion, a tech-nique that offers the advantage of convenience an...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{dose-response}} {{study was}} designed to test two low dose regimens of urokinase administered over a prolonged time period in patients with chronic refractory angina pectoris with respect to effects on clinical symptoms and objectives variables of myocardial ischemia. Background. Patients with severe and chronic refractory angina pectoris in end-stage coronary artery disease represent an increasing clinical problem. Favorable therapeutic effects on myocardial ischemia have been reported for long-term application of low dose urokinase. Methods. Ninety-eight patients with chronic refractory and end-stage coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: group A (49 patients) received 50, 000 IU and group B (49 patients) 500, 000 IU of urokinase as an intravenous bolus injection three times a week over a period of 12 weeks. Variables evaluated were number of weekly anginal events, data from ergometric exercise testing with simultaneous electrocardiographic registration, semiquantitative evaluation of Tc- 99 m 2 -methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) scans and rheologic variables. Results. After 12 weeks of treatment, anginal symptoms (events/week) were reduced significantly in group B by 70 % compared with 24 % in group A (p < 0. 001). Fibrinogen decreased by 3 % in group A and by 33 % in group B (p < 0. 001). Plasma viscosity and red blood cell aggregation were reduced by 6. 4 % (p < 0. 001) and 19. 9 % (p < 0. 001), respectively, in group B. Objectives variables of myocardial ischemia were improved significantly in group B only. <b>No</b> <b>cumulation</b> of coronary ischemic events was observed in group B. Conclusions. Long-term intermittent urokinase therapy in an applied dose of 3 × 500, 000 IU/week represents an effective anti-ischemic and antianginal approach for patients with refractory angina pectoris and end-stage coronary artery disease. Apart from rheologic improvement, antithrombotic properties and plaque regression are likely anti-ischemic mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|A new {{computational}} method derived from Papuga PCr multiaxial criterion {{is presented in}} the paper. While the PCr criterion is suitable for a comparison of a local multiaxial loading with a fatigue limit, the PCF criterion derived is focused on computation within a finite life. Its use is intended for a variable amplitude multiaxial loading, where the Palmgren-Miner damage <b>cumulation</b> law is <b>applied.</b> The PCF method is based on local elastic stresses and their action within the standard S-N curves of smooth specimens. No arrangement concerning the stress gradient effect was applied, since the experiments serving for comparison were carried on smooth and unnotched specimens. The experimental set covers different load paths applied to specimens manufactured of CSN 41 1523 structural steel. Computational results are promising for cases with load paths formed from single unclosed lines, but for the cases with load paths related to closed constructs it provides too conservative solution. A need for a further term counting for the multiaxial hardening is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The new {{water-soluble}} benzodiazepine midazolam {{was compared}} in a randomized study to diazepam for postoperative sedation in fifty patients following aortocoronary bypass surgery with a sufentanil-anesthesia. Midazolam and diazepam were administered intravenously in repeated doses {{in conjunction with}} an opioid infusion (piritramide) {{from the end of}} surgery during a twelve-hour study period, patients being artificially ventilated. Midazolam scored better than diazepam for quality of sedation and cardiovascular stability during the period of mechanical ventilation and for respiration during the weaning period and after extubation, although no difference was found in weaning time from artificial ventilation and time of extubation. Hemodynamic tolerance for both drugs was good. The administration of a loading dose of midazolam 5 mg caused a slight, transient decrease in mean arterial pressure. Midazolam appeared to be a more effective sedative agent than diazepam for short-term administration during mechanical ventilation. <b>No</b> evidence of <b>cumulation</b> and prolonged recovery was seen. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolic}} fate and pharmacokinetics of Bamifylline {{have been investigated}} by high performance liquid- and gas-chromatography techniques and radio-isotopic methods in several experiments following oral and intravenous administration of single and repeated doses of 300 mg, 600 mg and 900 mg of this drug. The 300 mg single- and multiple-dose experiments were performed by comparing Bamifylline with 200 mg of Theophylline {{within the confines of}} controlled double-blind randomized cross-over studies. Bamifylline is catabolized into several closely related compounds and into sulpho- and glucurono-conjugates of an hydroxylated derivative. Its metabolites are rapidly and extensively excreted via the kidneys and the liver. Only the unchanged Bamifylline has been recorded in the blood following administration of the radio-labelled parent compound. Bamifylline achieves peak plasma levels more rapidly than Theophylline. The half-time of Bamifylline plasma concentrations ranges from 1. 5 hours to 2. 0 hours, which is appreciably shorter than that of Theophylline which exceeds four hours. By further contrast the distribution volumes of Bamifylline are three to ten times larger than those of Theophylline. <b>No</b> evidence of <b>cumulation</b> has been found in blood following the repeated administration off doses as high as 900 mg administered at intervals of eight hours...|$|R
