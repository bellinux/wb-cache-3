Tamura flees as well; looking back, he sees many bodies strewn around, but chooses {{not to go to}} the aid of any who may still be alive.|$|E

Being {{in the middle of the}} Thames, he presently fell down, only saying, 'An impost, an impost,' and so died. A most sad storm of wind immediately following.|$|E

25|$|Infuriated {{that his}} orders were being defied and a golden {{opportunity}} was being lost, Bragg issued new orders for Hindman to attack early September 11. Cleburne, who was <b>not</b> <b>sick</b> as Hill had claimed, cleared the felled timber from Dug Gap and prepared to advance {{when he heard the}} sound of Hindman's guns. By this time, however, Baird's division had reached Negley's, and Negley had withdrawn his division to a defensive position just east of the crossroads. The two Union divisions then withdrew to Stevens Gap. Hindman's men skirmished with Baird's rear guard, but could not prevent the withdrawal of the Union force.|$|E
500|$|The Kansas City Star, which owned a {{radio station}} that competed with Brinkley's, ran an {{unfavorable}} series of reports on him. By 1930, when the Kansas Medical Board held a formal hearing to decide whether Brinkley's medical license should be revoked, Brinkley had signed death certificates for 42 people, {{many of whom were}} <b>not</b> <b>sick</b> when they showed up at his clinic. It is unclear how many more of Brinkley's patients may have become ill or later died elsewhere. The medical board revoked his license, stating that Brinkley [...] "has performed an organized charlatanism ... quite beyond the invention of the humble mountebank".|$|E

[...] The pop star bought the {{teenager}} a red Ford Mustang, and invited White and his mother to spend time at his Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California. Surprising his doctors, White lived five years longer than initially predicted and died in April 1990, shortly before he would have completed high school. His funeral was attended by Jackson, as well as English musician Elton John, media personality Phil Donahue, First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush, and 1000 other mourners.|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} quatrain, after again {{questioning}} {{the integrity of}} his rival's work, Shakespeare continues to affirm his fearlessness {{in the face of}} his rival's poetry. Lines nine and ten lend themselves to the same ambiguous interpretation found in the previous quatrain, with many scholars reading them as a reference to a specific poet. Of the [...] "affable familiar ghost" [...] found in line nine, Duncan-Jones writes: [...] "The phrase seems to carry an allusion to some well-known relationship between a poet and his Muse or inspiring genius, such as Chapman's with the spirit of Homer." [...] Shakespeare, however, mocks this relationship, stating that the Rival has been [...] "gulled" [...] by whatever spirit he may be communicating with and even this creative alliance is unable to claim the victory of the speaker's silence. The final line of the quatrain ("I was <b>not</b> <b>sick</b> of any fear from thence.") sets the stage for the couplet, alluding to the fact that, while his fear did not come from [...] "thence," [...] i.e., the rival poet, there is indeed a fear that has disrupted his poetic output.|$|E

2500|$|The oceanodromous Regalecus glesne is {{recorded}} as spawning off Mexico from July to December; all species are presumed to not guard their eggs, and release brightly coloured, buoyant eggs, up to [...] across, which {{are incorporated into}} the zooplankton.

2500|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} World War II, {{the revelation of}} the Holocaust and related Nazi medical abuses brought about changes in international law. Western allies formulated the Nuremberg Code {{to protect the rights}} of research subjects. In 1964 the World Health Organization's Declaration of Helsinki specified that experiments involving human beings needed the [...] "informed consent" [...] of participants. But no one appeared to have reevaluated the protocols of the Tuskegee Study according to the new standards and in light of treatment available for the disease which is fatal 8–58% of the time. On July 25, 1972 word of the Tuskegee Study was reported by Jean Heller of the Associated Press; the next day the New York Times carried it on its front page, and the story captured national attention. Peter Buxtun, a whistleblower who was a former PHS interviewer for venereal disease, had leaked information after failing to get a response to his protests about the study within the department. He gave information to the Washington Star and the New York Times. John R. Heller Jr. of PHS, who in later years of the study led the national division, still defended the ethics of the study, stating: [...] "The longer the study, the better the ultimate information we would derive." [...] Author James Jones editorialized about Heller, suggesting that his opinion was: [...] "The men's status did not warrant ethical debate. They were subjects, not patients; clinical material, <b>not</b> <b>sick</b> people." ...|$|E

2500|$|McNabb led {{his team}} against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX. McNabb {{struggled}} at times, throwing three crucial interceptions. Two {{of these were}} thrown in New England territory, {{and one of those}} two was inside the twenty-yard line. The final interception was during a last-gasp Hail Mary {{at the end of the}} game. He was also sacked four times. Controversy surrounded the end of the game, as center Hank Fraley claimed that McNabb was seriously ill. Wide receiver Freddie Mitchell claimed that he had to call a few plays due to McNabb's illness. However, in an interview with NBC, McNabb said he was <b>not</b> <b>sick</b> and did not throw up. He just said he was tired. Some reports claim that McNabb had the wind knocked out of him by an earlier hit while others assert that he was unduly fatigued (interestingly, McNabb also suffered from a bout of nausea at the conclusion of a 2002 regular-season game played at Alltel Stadium, where Super Bowl XXXIX was contested). An article written by a staff member of The Philadelphia Inquirer refuted allegations of McNabb throwing up during the Super Bowl and even labeled the alleged incident [...] "a myth". Both head coach Andy Reid and McNabb have denied any physical problems that led to the puzzlingly slow pace of play. Despite all of the problems, McNabb finished the game with 30 completions for 357 yards, the third highest total for both categories in Super Bowl history, and three touchdowns, the only points in the game for Philadelphia. Despite McNabb's efforts, the Eagles lost by a score of 24–21.|$|E
