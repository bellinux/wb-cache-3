5|$|Frogs {{have served}} as {{experimental}} animals {{throughout the history of}} science. Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog's heart in a procedure called a Stannius ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates. The African clawed frog or platanna (Xenopus laevis) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell <b>nuclear</b> <b>transfer.</b> This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the age of fusion–evaporation reactions to produce superheavy elements {{is coming to an end}} due to the increasingly short half-lives to spontaneous fission and the looming proton drip line, so that new techniques such as <b>nuclear</b> <b>transfer</b> reactions (for example, firing uranium nuclei at each other and letting them exchange protons, potentially producing products with around 120 protons) would be required to reach the superactinides. On the other hand, many changes in techniques have been needed to synthesise transuranium elements, from neutron capture (until Z = 100) to light-ion bombardment (until Z = 110) to cold fusion (until Z = 113) and now hot fusion with 48Ca (until Z = 118), not to mention the essential difference before and after uranium between finding the elements chemically or spectroscopically in nature and synthesising them. In spite of this, the rate of discovery of new elements has remained at one every two and a half years on average for the past two and a half centuries.|$|E

25|$|One {{concern is}} that blastula {{creation}} in SCNT-based human stem cell research {{will lead to the}} reproductive cloning of humans. Both processes use the same first step: the creation of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>transferred</b> embryo, most likely via SCNT.

25|$|Interspecies <b>nuclear</b> <b>transfer</b> (iSCNT) is a {{means of}} somatic cell <b>nuclear</b> <b>transfer</b> used to {{facilitate}} the rescue of endangered species, or even to restore species after their extinction. The technique is similar to SCNT cloning which typically is between domestic animals and rodents, or where there is a ready supply of oocytes and surrogate animals. However, the cloning of highly endangered or extinct species requires the use of an alternative method of cloning. Interspecies <b>nuclear</b> <b>transfer</b> utilizes a host and a donor of two different organisms that are closely related species and within the same genus. In 2000, Robert Lanza was able to produce a cloned fetus of a gaur, Bos gaurus, combining it successfully with a domestic cow, Bos taurus.|$|E

The Nevada Test Site approach divided all onsite transfers {{into two groups}} with each group covered by a standalone OTSD identified as Non-Nuclear and <b>Nuclear.</b> The Non-Nuclear <b>transfers</b> involve all radioactive hazardous material in less than Hazard Category (HC) - 3 quantities and all chemically hazardous materials.

Both OTSDs comply with DOE O 460. 1 B requirements.

All <b>Nuclear</b> OTSD proposed <b>transfers</b> were determined to be non-equivalent and a methodology was developed to determine if “equivalent safety” to a fully compliant Department of Transportation (DOT) transfer was achieved.

Equivalent safety is demonstrated when the risk level for each controlled transfer is equal to or less than the corresponding DOT-compliant transfer risk level. In this comparison the typical DOE-STD- 3009 risk matrix was modified to reflect transportation requirements. Design basis conditions (DBCs) were developed for each non-equivalent transfer. Initial DBCs were based solely upon the amount of material present. Route-, transfer-, and site-specific conditions were evaluated and the initial DBCs revised as needed.

25|$|In {{somatic cell}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>transfer</b> ("SCNT"), {{the nucleus of}} a somatic cell is taken from a donor and transplanted into a host egg cell, which had its own genetic {{material}} removed previously, making it an enucleated egg.

25|$|The {{embryonic}} {{techniques of}} somatic cell <b>nuclear</b> <b>transfer</b> from a specific genotype via cloning, {{as well as}} some of the problems pre-figured in Blade Runner, were demonstrated by the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1996. Since 2001, political efforts have been mounting in many countries to ban human cloning, impelled by a sense of its abhorrence and imminence, while rumors abound that the first human clones may already have been produced, the most famous example being a claim by the extraterrestrial worshiping Raelians, a religious group who have offered no proof to support their extraordinary claims. In all of these developments, a clear tension between commercial and non-commercial interests is apparent, as scientific and business motivations conflict with ethical and religious concerns about the appropriateness of human intervention in the deepest fabric of nature. In many ways Blade Runner serves as a cautionary tale in the tradition of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} somatic cell nuclear {{transplant}} involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, {{known as the}} ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (Somatic Cell <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Transfer)</b> experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a somatic cell, referring to {{the cells of the}} human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a somatic cell and an unnucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the 'empty' ovum. After being inserted into the egg, the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell. The ovum, now containing the somatic cell's nucleus, is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide. The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone). Stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning {{or in the case of}} reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term.|$|E
