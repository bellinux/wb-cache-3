5|$|According to Naman Ramachandran, {{the author}} of , most of Rajinikanth's philanthropic {{activities}} went unpublicised because he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to be so. In the 1980s, when superstitious beliefs prevented a majority of people from donating eyes, Rajinikanth took the case of campaigning in support of corneal transplantation via television and public speeches. In 2011, Rajinikanth announced {{his support for the}} anti-corruption movement led by Gandhian Anna Hazare and offered his marriage hall, the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam, in Chennai free of cost for the India Against Corruption members to hold their fast. Rajinikanth's fan associations regularly organise blood donation and eye donation camps and distribute food during his birthday.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2017, Emirates has 48 orders {{outstanding}} {{but due to}} lack {{of space}} in Dubai Airport, it deferred 12 deliveries by one year and will not take any in 2019-20 before replacing its early airliners from 2021: there are open production slots in 2019 and Airbus reduced its production rate at 12 per year for 2017-18. The real backlog is much smaller than the official 107 with 47 uncertain orders: 20 commitments for the A380-specialized lessor Amedeo which commits to production only once aircraft are placed, eight for Qantas which wants to keep its fleet at 12, six for Virgin Atlantic which does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> anymore and three ex Transaero for finance vehicle Air Accord.|$|E

In 1910 or 1911, she moved to Dallas, Oregon where her husband {{supervised}} the Willamette Valley Lumber Company. They had three daughters, Georgiana, Irene, and Jean. She did not like the Dallas schools, so she hired a live-in governess for her daughters. <b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>them</b> to be in seclusion, she later opened a private kindergarten in their home and invited other girls to attend.|$|R
5|$|Bhardwaj {{instructed}} the film's entire {{cast and crew}} to watch caper classics such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000), Pulp Fiction (1994) and True Romance (1993) to study the nuances and {{become familiar with the}} genre. Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu, twin brothers with speech impediments; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers. The producers did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to look like caricatures, so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments. According to Kapoor, the producers wanted to find out about the medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects. They met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping. Kapoor said that each role had its own challenges. Charlie's physique was very different from Kapoor's and it took him nearly a year to change the look of his body. He found changing from one character to the other difficult.|$|E
5|$|For the {{hand-held}} camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs {{that were}} smaller and lighter than previous cameras and {{allowed him to}} move freely. In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had {{to keep track of}} many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to have to figure out which story they were watching.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi used fasting as a {{political}} device, often threatening suicide unless demands were met. Congress publicised the fasts as {{a political}} action that generated widespread sympathy. In response the government tried to manipulate news coverage to minimise his challenge to the Raj. He fasted in 1932 to protest the voting scheme for separate political representation for Dalits; Gandhi did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> segregated. The British government stopped the London press from showing photographs of his emaciated body, because it would elicit sympathy. Gandhi's 1943 hunger strike took place during a two-year prison term for the anticolonial Quit India movement. The government called on nutritional experts to demystify his action, and again no photos were allowed. However, his final fast in 1948, {{after the end of}} British rule in India, his hunger strike was lauded by the British press and this time did include full-length photos.|$|E

Winn, who had two young children with his wife, Mary Elizabeth Vaughn, was touched by the boys' tale and was concerned for their safety. <b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>them</b> to join outlaws, Winn and his wife took them in. On the Rufus Winn ranch Banister assisted Winn with all manner of chores and duties, and within a short time became a vital family and community member.|$|R

5|$|Phát was {{supposed}} to seize the second largest {{air force base in}} the country, located in the satellite city of Biên Hòa outside Saigon. This was to prevent Kỳ from mobilizing air power against them, but this failed, as Kỳ had already flown there to take control after dropping Khánh off at Vũng Tàu. Phát could not challenge Kỳ's fighter planes, which were already patrolling the air above Biên Hòa by the time they arrived. Kỳ flew a short distance southwest and circled Tân Sơn Nhất, threatening to bomb the rebels. Kỳ had never trusted Thảo or Phát, and did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> in power. Most of the forces of the III and IV Corps surrounding the capital disliked both Khánh and the rebels, and took no action. As nightfall came, it appeared that forces loyal to Khánh were strengthening as they began to move towards Saigon.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E

25|$|The first {{sizeable}} {{batch of}} Boer {{prisoners of war}} taken by the British consisted of those captured at the Battle of Elandslaagte on 21 October 1899. At first, many were put on ships, but as numbers grew, the British decided they did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> kept locally. The capture of 400 POWs in February 1900 was a key event, which made the British realise they could not accommodate all POWs in South Africa. The British feared they could be freed by sympathetic locals. Moreover, they already had trouble supplying their own troops in South Africa, {{and did not want}} the added burden of sending supplies for the POWs. Britain therefore chose to send many POWs overseas.|$|E
25|$|Dungeons & Dragons co-creator Dave Arneson {{described}} {{the origin of}} hit points in a 2002 interview. When Arneson was adapting the medieval wargame Chainmail (1971) to a fantasy setting, a process that with Gary Gygax would lead to Dungeons & Dragons, {{he saw that the}} emphasis of the gameplay was moving from large armies to small groups of heroes and eventually to the identification of one player and one character that is essential to role-playing as it was originally conceived. Players became attached to their heroes and did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to die every time they lost a die roll. Players were thus given multiple hit points which were incrementally decreased as they took damage. Arneson took the concept, along with armor class, from a set of a naval American Civil War game's rules.|$|E

People in the community would cast scorn on Caron but, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>them</b> to see they were emotionally scarring him, he would laugh it off and run away and do something bad. When Caron got into trouble, his older stepbrothers would hold him down while his father mercilessly whipped him. The whippings had little effect on Caron, and he would find other ways to punish himself, like punching a shed door until his knuckles bled.|$|R

Although she has previously met Leonard and likes him, she is uncomfortable about meeting his academic parents, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>them</b> to think of her family as [...] "white trash".

25|$|Wilson became {{increasingly}} concerned that Tudor, with the connivance of Lloyd George, {{who loved to}} drop hints to that effect, was operating an unofficial policy of killing IRA men in reprisal {{for the deaths of}} pro-Crown forces. Wilson wrote to Macready (June 1920) that “the discipline and good name of the Army is worth half a dozen Irelands” – although sympathetic, he had been deeply concerned to hear of troops smashing up Fermoy in reprisal for the kidnapping of General Cuthbert. However, Macready also told Wilson that the Army was arranging “accidents” for suspected IRA men, but not telling the politicians as he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> “talked and joked about after dinner by Cabinet Ministers”. Lloyd George refused to formally declare martial law, not least because in July 1920 the Amritsar Massacre (of April 1919) was being debated by Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Alternately {{attributed}} to the 16th and 17th centuries, Groote Wafelen from the Belgian Een Antwerps kookboek was published as the first recipe to use leavening (beer yeast): Take white flour, warm cream, fresh melted butter, yeast, and mix together until the flour is no longer visible. Then add ten or twelve egg yolks. Those who do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to be too expensive may also add the egg white and just milk. Put the resulting dough at the fireplace for four hours to let it rise better before baking it. Until this time, no recipes contained leavening and could therefore be easily cooked in the thin moule à oublies. Groote Wafelen, in its use of leavening, was the genesis of contemporary waffles and validates the use of deeper irons (wafelijzers) depicted in the Beuckelaer and Bruegel paintings of the time.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, KKR {{opted to}} put WTVJ and the Storer {{stations}} on the market. The firm {{had plans to}} sell channel 4 for a record price of close to $500 million (as part of a $1.85 billion group deal with six of the Storer stations), although the station was actually worth far less. CBS saw a chance to acquire an owned-and-operated station in the fast-growing Miami market. However, it lost a bidding war to television syndication company Lorimar-Telepictures. CBS, however, tried to block the deal; Lorimar produced Dallas, Knots Landing, Falcon Crest, and other shows for the network and did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> controlling the clearance rights of those particular programs. Thus, CBS threatened to yank its affiliation with WTVJ if the Lorimar deal went through, which would force the station to become an independent. Lorimar then {{walked away from the}} group deal in May 1986, CBS then made an offer to buy WTVJ for $170 million, which was far below KKR's asking price of at least $270 million.|$|E
5000|$|Love hotels (러브호텔), {{also known}} as love motels, first {{appeared}} in South Korea in the mid-1980s. They were originally called [...] "Parktel" [...] (박텔). Their boom and growth was originally attributed to the 1988 Olympics {{which took place in}} Seoul. The hotels have historically been seen as seedy, with some residents speaking out against <b>them</b> and <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>them</b> within certain distances of schools and residential areas. However, some hotel owners have tried to remove that element from their business by upgrading, offering cleaner modern services, and removing some of the more sexual elements from their decor.

On the January 21 episode of Raw, The Shield performed a triple-powerbomb on The Rock, Punk's WWE Championship contender at the event, resulting in Mr. McMahon declaring that their interference in the title match would result in Punk being stripped of the title. Four days later on SmackDown, Punk denied an alliance with The Shield before calling them out and informing them that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to interfere in his upcoming title match. However, during Punk's title match at the Royal Rumble on January 27 a blackout occurred, The Rock was attacked by The Shield in the darkness and when the lights came back on he had been put through the announce table, leading to Punk pinning The Rock and retaining the title, only for the match to be immediately restarted by McMahon with The Rock winning the WWE Championship. The following night on Raw it was revealed through footage played by McMahon that Punk's manager Paul Heyman had been paying The Shield and Brad Maddox {{to work for him}} all along.|$|E

[...] She argued that obscenity laws were largely ineffectual, that when they were effectual they only suppressed pornography from public view while allowing it to flourish out of sight, and that they suppressed the wrong material, or the right material for the wrong reasons, arguing that [...] "Obscenity laws are also woman-hating in their very construction.

This was problematic, as he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>them</b> to [...] "become the actual monsters", so he took great care in their design. Ramuh—an old wizard from earlier Final Fantasy games—was replaced; other human-like designs were re-imagined nude and with creature-like elements. Nomura, also {{the director of the}} Guardian Force animation sequences, wanted to create a greater impact than the summons of Final Fantasy VII. Leviathan was created as a test and included in a game demo. Garnering a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.|$|E
