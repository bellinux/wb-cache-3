25|$|Convex-concave (meniscus) lenses can {{be either}} {{positive}} or negative, depending on the relative curvatures of the two surfaces. A <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens has a steeper concave surface and is thinner at the centre than at the periphery. Conversely, a positive meniscus lens has a steeper convex surface and is thicker at the centre than at the periphery. An ideal thin lens with two surfaces of equal curvature would have zero optical power, meaning that it would neither converge nor diverge light. All real lenses have nonzero thickness, however, which makes a real lens with identical curved surfaces slightly positive. To obtain exactly zero optical power, a meniscus lens must have slightly unequal curvatures {{to account for the}} effect of the lens' thickness.|$|E
50|$|A {{meniscus}} corrector is a <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens {{that is used}} {{to correct}} spherical aberration in image-forming optical systems such as catadioptric telescopes. It works by having the equal but opposite spherical aberration of the objective it is designed to correct (usually a spherical mirror).|$|E
50|$|The Gauss lens {{consists}} of two lenses; in its most basic form, a positive meniscus lens on the object side and a <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens on the image side. The power of the positive element predominates, but the negative element corrects for chromatic aberration.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} two element Gauss was {{a telescope}} objective lens consisting of closely spaced positive and <b>negative</b> <b>menisci,</b> invented in 1817 Carl Friedrich Gauss as an improvement to the Fraunhofer telescope objective {{by adding a}} meniscus lens to its single convex and concave lens design. Alvan Clark and Bausch & Lomb further refined the design in 1888 by taking two of these lenses and placing them back to back making a [...] "double Gauss" [...] with indifferent photographic results. Current double Gauss lenses {{can be traced back}} to an 1895 improved design, when Paul Rudolph of Carl Zeiss Jena thickened the interior <b>negative</b> <b>menisci</b> and converted to them to cemented doublets of two elements of equal refraction but differing dispersion in the Zeiss Planar of 1896 to correct for chromatic aberration. It was the original six element symmetric f/4.5 Double Gauss lens. Horace William Lee added a slight asymmetry to the Planar in 1920, and created the Taylor, Taylor & Hobson Series 0 (also called the Lee Opic, UK) f/2 lens. It was commercially unsuccessful, but its asymmetry is the foundation of the modern Double Gauss, including the Zeiss Biotar. Later the design was developed with additional glasses to give high-performance lenses of wide aperture. The main development was due to Taylor Hobson in the 1920s, resulting in the f/2.0 Opic and later the Speed Panchro designs, which were licensed to various other manufacturers. In 1927, Lee modified the Opic design and increase the maximum aperture up to f/1.4, that is the Ultra Panchro lens. Further improvement was done by Lee in 1930, the Super Speed Panchro. It was a f/1.5 fast design with 7 glasses in 5 groups, which soon became new popular of fast speed lens type and was cited by many lens manufacturers until the 1960s.The Biotar is another competitor of British Panchro series. In the same year of 1927, Zeiss designed Biotar 50mm f/1.4 for cinematography. Its still photography version, Zeiss Biotar 58mm f/2 (Germany) appeared on the Ihagee Kine Exakta (1936, Germany), the first widely available 35mm single-lens reflex cameras, in 1939. It was also the standard lens on the VEB Zeiss Ikon (Dresden) Contax S (1949, East Germany), the first pentaprism eyelevel viewing 35mm SLR. The Biotar, originally designed in 1927, had a six element asymmetric Double Gauss formula. Post-World War II Zeiss (Oberkochen, West Germany) no longer uses the Biotar name; instead lumping any Double Gauss variant under the Planar name. The Soviet 2/58mm standard lens of the Zenit camera was the most common version of the Biotar, making an excellent value-for-money accessory today for any digital camera with APS size sensor.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{reporting on}} clinical results, {{the effect of}} meniscus allograft transplantation {{on the development of}} osteoarthritis is still unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} systematically review all studies on the effect of meniscus allograft transplantation on articular cartilage in animals. Pubmed and Embase were searched for original articles concerning the effect of meniscus allograft transplantation on articular cartilage compared with both its positive (meniscectomy) and negative (either sham or non-operated) control in healthy animals. Outcome measures related to assessment of damage to articular cartilage were divided in five principal outcome categories. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated and pooled to obtain an overall SMD and 95 % confidence interval. 17 articles were identified, representing 14 original animal cohorts with an average timing of data collection of 24 weeks [range 4 weeks; 30 months]. Compared to a <b>negative</b> control, <b>meniscus</b> allograft transplantation caused gross macroscopic (1. 45 [0. 95; 1. 95]), histological (3. 43 [2. 25; 4. 61]) damage to articular cartilage, and osteoarthritic changes on radiographs (3. 12 [1. 42; 4. 82]). Moreover, results on histomorphometrics and cartilage biomechanics are supportive of this detrimental effect on cartilage. On the other hand, meniscus allograft transplantation caused significantly less gross macroscopic (- 1. 19 [- 1. 84; - 0. 54]) and histological (- 1. 70 [- 2. 67; - 0. 74]) damage to articular cartilage when compared to meniscectomy. However, there was no difference in osteoarthritic changes on plain radiographs (0. 04 [- 0. 48; 0. 57]), and results on histomorphometrics and biomechanics did neither show a difference in effect between meniscus allograft transplantation and meniscectomy. In conclusion, although meniscus allograft transplantation does not protect articular cartilage from damage, it reduces the extent of it when compared with meniscectomy...|$|R
5000|$|In optics, a Mangin {{mirror is}} a <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens with the {{reflective}} surface {{on the rear}} {{side of the glass}} forming a curved mirror that reflects light without spherical aberration. This reflector was invented in 1876 by a French officer Alphonse Mangin [...] as an improved catadioptric reflector for search lights and is also used in other optical devices.|$|E
5000|$|The double Gauss lens {{consists}} of two back-to-back Gauss lenses (a design with a positive meniscus lens on the object side and a <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens on the image side) making two positive meniscus lenses on the outside with two <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> lenses inside them. The symmetry {{of the system and}} the splitting of the optical power into many elements reduces the optical aberrations within the system. There are many variations of the design. Sometimes extra lens elements are added. The basic lens type {{is one of the most}} developed and utilized photographic lenses. The design forms the basis for many camera lenses in use today, especially the wide-aperture standard lenses used on 35 mm and other small-format cameras. It can offer good results up to [...] with a wide field of view, and has sometimes been made at 1.0. Extra wide aperture f/1.4 Double Gauss lenses usually have seven elements for extra aberration control. Modern super wide aperture models can have eight or more elements. Moderate aperture f/2.8 versions can be simplified to five elements.|$|E
50|$|The first fisheye lens was the Beck Hill Sky (or Cloud; UK) lens of 1923. Robin Hill {{intended}} {{it to be}} pointed straight up to take 360° azimuth barrel distorted hemispheric sky images for scientific cloud cover studies. It used a bulging <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> to compress the 180° field to 60° before passing the light through a stop to a moderate wide angle lens. The Sky was 21mm f/8 producing 63mm diameter images. Pairs were used at 500 meter spacing producing stereoscopes for the British Meteorological Office.|$|E
5000|$|Dmitri Maksutov {{may have}} been working with the idea of pairing a spherical primary mirror in {{conjunction}} with a <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens as far back as 1936. His notes from that time on the function of Mangin mirrors, an early catadioptric spotlight reflector consisting of negative lens with silvering on the back side, include a sketch of Mangin mirror with the mirror part and the negative lens separated into two elements. Maksutov seems to have picked up the idea again in 1941 war-torn Europe as a variation on an earlier design that paired a spherical mirror with a negative lens, Bernhard Schmidt's 1931 [...] "Schmidt Camera". Maksutov claimed to have come {{up with the idea of}} replacing the complex Schmidt corrector plate with an all-spherical [...] "meniscus corrector plate" [...] while riding in a train of refugees from Leningrad. Maksutov is described as patenting his design in May, August, or October 1941 and building a [...] "Maksutov-Gregorian"-style prototype in October 1941. Maksutov came up with the unique idea using an [...] "achromatic corrector", a corrector made of a single type of glass with a weak <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> shape that departed from the pure concentric spherical symmetrical shape to correct chromatic aberration.|$|E
5000|$|Maksutov's most {{well known}} {{contribution}} {{in the field}} of optics was made in 1941, when he invented the Maksutov telescope. Like the Schmidt telescope, the Maksutov corrects for spherical aberration by placing a corrector lens in front of the primary mirror. However, where the Schmidt uses an aspheric corrector at the entrance pupil, Maksutov's telescope uses a deeply curved full diameter <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens (a [...] "meniscus corrector shell"). He published the design in 1944 in a paper entitled [...] "Новые катадиоптрические менисковые системы" [...] catadioptric meniscus systems. This method was adopted not only by his own laboratory for many of the most important observatories in the Soviet Union, but also internationally. Several commercial telescope-making companies produce Maksutovs, including Celestron, Meade, and Questar.|$|E
5000|$|The Maksutov (also {{called a}} [...] "Mak") is a {{catadioptric}} telescope design that combines a spherical mirror with a weakly <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens in {{a design that}} takes advantage of all the surfaces being nearly [...] "spherically symmetrical". The negative lens is usually full diameter and placed at the entrance pupil of the telescope (commonly called a [...] "corrector plate" [...] or [...] "meniscus corrector shell"). The design corrects the problems of off-axis aberrations such as coma found in reflecting telescopes while also correcting chromatic aberration. It was patented in 1941 by Russian optician Dmitri Dmitrievich Maksutov. Maksutov based his design on the idea behind the Schmidt camera of using the spherical errors of a negative lens to correct the opposite errors in a spherical primary mirror. The design is most commonly seen in a Cassegrain variation, with an integrated secondary, that can use all-spherical elements, thereby simplifying fabrication. Maksutov telescopes have been sold on the amateur market since the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The Mangin mirror's {{construction}} {{consists of}} a concave (<b>negative</b> <b>meniscus)</b> lens made of crown glass with spherical surfaces of different radii with the reflective coating on the shallower rear surface. The spherical aberration normally produced by the simple spherical mirror surface is canceled out by the opposite spherical aberration produced by the light traveling through the negative lens. Since light passes through the glass twice, the overall system acts like a triplet lens. The Mangin mirror was invented in 1876 by a French military engineer named Colonel Alphonse Mangin {{as a substitute for}} the more difficult to manufacture parabolic reflecting mirror for use in searchlights. Since the catadioptric design eliminated most of the off-axis aberration found in parabolic mirrors, Mangin mirrors had the added advantage of producing a nearly true parallel beam of light. They saw use in the late 19th century as reflectors for naval search lights. Its use in military applications was limited, since glass reflectors of any kind were thought to be too fragile and susceptible to enemy gunfire.|$|E
50|$|If {{the lens}} is biconcave or plano-concave, a {{collimated}} {{beam of light}} passing through the lens is diverged (spread); the lens is thus called a negative or diverging lens. The beam, after passing through the lens, appears to emanate from a particular point on the axis {{in front of the}} lens. The distance from this point to the lens is also known as the focal length, though it is negative with respect to the focal length of a converging lens.Convex-concave (meniscus) lenses can be either positive or negative, depending on the relative curvatures of the two surfaces. A <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> lens has a steeper concave surface and is thinner at the centre than at the periphery. Conversely, a positive meniscus lens has a steeper convex surface and is thicker at the centre than at the periphery. An ideal thin lens with two surfaces of equal curvature would have zero optical power, meaning that it would neither converge nor diverge light. All real lenses have nonzero thickness, however, which makes a real lens with identical curved surfaces slightly positive. To obtain exactly zero optical power, a meniscus lens must have slightly unequal curvatures to account for the effect of the lens' thickness.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the present work is heat {{transfer}} close to moving three-phase contact lines. The term three-phase contact line designates {{the area in which}} the liquid/vapour- or liquid/gas-interface approaches a solid wall. Due to the small thermal resistance of the extremely thin liquid film high heat fluxes are reached within this area. These can have significant influence onto the overall heat transfer process within two-phase systems. Examples of such systems are pool and flow boiling, droplet evaporation during spray cooling applications or heat pipes used for high power electronics cooling. The more the interface approaches to the heated wall, the stronger the influence of intermolecular interactions between wall molecules and those at the liquid/vapour-interface onto the local phase equilibrium becomes. This results in a shift of the equilibrium to higher temperatures, so that local evaporation is entirely inhibited through intermolecular forces at a certain minimum liquid film thickness. A few molecule layers thin liquid film that cannot be evaporated remains on the apparently dry surface. Apart from the wall superheat, the direction of contact line movement and its velocity, as well as the system pressure influence the local heat transfer in the contact line area decisively. While there is some experimental work on the influence of contact line velocity and its movement direction, the influence of system pressure has remained uninvestigated up to date. Aim of this work is therefore a target oriented experimental investigation of the pressure and velocity influence on heat transfer in the proximity of moving three-phase contact lines. Core of the dedicated experiment setup is an infrared transparent heater element, which provides the possibility to measure the temperature fields at the heater/fluid interface with high spatial and temporal resolution using infrared thermography. The heater developed for this purpose consists of an infrared transparent substrate, onto which a two-layer composition of black Chromium Nitride and pure Chromium with an overall thickness of approximately 800 nm is applied through Physical Vapour Deposition. While the black Chromium Nitride layer enhances the surface emissivity and thereby increases the signal-to-noise-ratio of the IR thermography drastically, the pure Chromium is employed as resistance heater to achieve the wall superheat necessary for evaporation. As experiment fluid degassed FC- 72 (n-perfluorohexane) is used. Within the experiment setup a single capillary slot with a width of 1. 4 mm is created between the infrared transparent heater and a polished copper wall. Liquid rises between the walls of the slot due to capillary forces and forms a single extended meniscus. The system pressure is adjusted through the saturation state of the fluid by variation of the system temperature, while the movement of the meniscus is realized through a volume displacement within the system. Movement of the meniscus results in an advancing or a receding contact line situation at the surface of the IR transparent heater, that influences the local temperature distribution at the heater wall. The temperature distribution on the backside of the Chromium Nitride layer at a distance of less than 1 micrometer away from the heater/fluid-interface is measured with a high speed IR camera at a framerate of 1000 Hz and a resolution of 29. 27 micrometer/pixel. The high speed IR camera is synchronized to a high speed black-and-white camera, that allows detection of the liquid/vapour-interface with a resolution of 4 micrometer/pixel. From the temperature fields the local heat flux distribution is calculated numerically with the same spatial and temporal resolution. Experiments were performed at reduced pressures in the range of p_R = 0. 05 to p_R = 0. 7 and with liquid/vapour-interface velocities of up to v_int = +- 40 mm/s. Comparisons to earlier experiments on three-phase contact line heat transfer show, that the results obtained using thin foil heaters are transferable to heaters with substantial larger thermal inertia, like the IR transparent heaters used within this work. Merely the extremely high temperature differences, that are present in proximity of the contact line, are significantly smaller on walls with higher thermal inertia. The conducted experiments clearly show a local heat flux peak in proximity of the contact line, which is accompanied by a local temperature minimum. At increased system pressure and equal wall superheat and contact line velocity, the local heat flux peak at the contact line decreases with increasing pressure. This effect {{can be attributed to the}} reduction of latent heat of evaporation with increasing pressure. Considering the influence of the contact line velocity, one must distinguish between advancing and receding contact lines. At a receding contact line and equal reduced pressure and wall superheat, no influence of the contact line velocity onto the local heat flux distribution in proximity of the contact line is discernible. At an advancing contact line on the other hand, an increase of the heat flux maximum at the wall and thereby the heat transfer in proximity of the contact line with increasing contact line velocity is observed. Both the increase of the heat flux maximum with increasing contact line velocity at an advancing contact line and the independence of the maximum heat flux on the contact line velocity at a receding contact line is observed at low and high levels of the reduced pressure. In some experiments with <b>negative</b> <b>meniscus</b> velocity (and therefore receding contact line) it was observed, that a thin, evaporating liquid film can be deposited on the heater surface by the moving liquid/vapour-interface. If and to which extend the thin film is deposited, depends on the wall superheat, the velocity and acceleration of the liquid/vapour-interface, the latent heat of evaporation of the fluid and the wetting characteristics of the heated wall. Furthermore it was observed, that film rupture due to instabilities can occur. If the thin film was present, the contribution of thin film evaporation to the overall heat transfer was dominating compared to the contribution of contact line heat transfer. This makes it necessary to describe the thin film with a model, if it appears during an evaporation process in order to capture the underlying physics correctly. Based on an estimation of the thickness of a liquid film staying behind on a wall drawn out of a quiescent liquid by Landau and Levich, a model for stationary thin film evaporation was developed. It is assumed, that thin film evaporation has no influence onto the initial film thickness, so it can be calculated according to Landau and Levich. Starting from the mass and energy balance at an infinitesimal thin segment of the film, an equation for the film thickness gradient in direction parallel to the wall is derived. By making the equation dimensionless, non-dimensional quantities governing thin film evolution are identified. Comparison of the length of the thin film region calculated using the model to lengths of the thin film region observed in the experiment shows good agreement up to a certain velocity, at which an increasing deviation between theoretical value and experimental data is observed. This deviation is probably caused by the limited length of the IR transparent heater, which does not allow for reaching steady state thin film evaporation...|$|E
