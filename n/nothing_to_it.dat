500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{felt that}} while the episode was [...] "still an {{entertaining}} half-hour, there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that was incredibly memorable." [...] He said that Tracy Jordan was [...] "quickly {{becoming one of the}} more enjoyable aspects of the show". Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide felt that [...] "this outing fell a bit flat for [...] ". He thought that [...] "the best moment this week, by far, had to be that big, fat wink to Aaron Sorkin's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (and West Wing, and Sports Night..., where Liz and Pete, upon realizing that they had traveled in a small circle {{over the course of a}} banter exchange, shrugged and said, 'Nice walk-and-talk', and then bumped fists. Nice." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{taking a}} pay cut to start the 1949 season, Feller pitched on Opening Day against the St. Louis Browns. During the game, he injured his {{shoulder}} and missed the rest of April. His performances were mixed {{in the rest of}} the season and he finished the year with a 15-14 record and a 3.75 ERA. Before the 1950 season, Feller suggested to Indians management he take {{a pay cut}}, and did so. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg said, [...] "He himself made the suggestion. In fact, he offered to take more than the 25 per cent maximum pay cut allowed. There was absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> We all agreed quickly on the figure after Bob showed up yesterday." [...] In a win over the Detroit Tigers in the second game of a doubleheader, Feller became the 53rd pitcher to win 200 games. Throughout the year, players noted that his velocity had returned, and, winning games with finesse rather than power, he was again effective. He finished the year with 16 wins and a 3.43 ERA.|$|E
2500|$|On January 9, the Newark Star Ledger {{reported}} through anonymous {{sources that}} Parcells had contacted the New York Giants about their available General Manager position, but the Giants {{were not interested}} in Parcells' services. [...] Parcells, the next day, quickly refuted any interest in the Giants GM position, stating, [...] "There is absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Whoever said it is a liar." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once {{the storm}} passed, Pittsburgh {{found itself in}} calm waters 900 miles from Guam. [...] "There was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> from then on," [...] Gingrich recalled. Pittsburgh arrived at Guam {{five days after the}} storm and was {{equipped}} with a temporary bow, leaving two weeks later for permanent repairs at Puget Sound Navy Yard in Washington. A week after Pittsburgh departed, the ship's bow was discovered afloat and towed back to Guam. The 500-mile separation between the cruiser's stern and bow led contemporary news accounts to dub Pittsburgh [...] "the longest ship in the Navy." ...|$|E
2500|$|CBS News journalist, Bob Schieffer, {{asked about}} the {{allegations}} on Imus in the Morning, stating, [...] "I believe that's a story {{that we will be}} avoiding, because it appears to me that there's absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> ... This seems to be just sort of a staple of modern campaigns, that you got through at least one love child, which turns out not to be a love child. And I think we can all do better than this one." [...] Mickey Kaus, a journalist at Slate, speculated that the lack of mainstream coverage was motivated by a desire not to harm Elizabeth Edwards, who was fighting cancer at the time. Kaus also considered the possibility of news organizations taking a [...] "wait-and-see" [...] attitude, pending the results of the Iowa caucuses.|$|E

2500|$|The Washington Post {{reported}} that public reaction to Shalom Baranes' {{design of the}} structures tended to be negative. Local Advisory Neighborhood Commission member Alexander Padro told the press, [...] "It's got <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> It's a lost opportunity. It's a shock to see them {{come up with a}} bunch of glass boxes instead of an impressive architectural statement." [...] Padro was strongly critical of the open plazas, pointing out that similar spaces in the city did not function as intended but were [...] "skateboard havens and homeless encampments." [...] Deborah Dietsch, architectural critic for the Washington Times, described the condominiums as [...] "disappointing", oppressive, out of place, and recalling [...] "1960s-era apartment blocks". She thought the apartment building designs were [...] "fresher". Dietsch also worried that public spaces, designed by the landscape architecture firm of Gustafson Guthrie Nichol, would be too flat, too hard, and [...] "more severe than serene." [...] But Washington Post architectural critic Philip Kennicott praised [...] "9 1/2 Street," [...] calling it [...] "the most distinctive feature" [...] of the redevelopment plan.|$|E
