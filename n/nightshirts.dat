2500|$|In 1896 Outcault {{was hired}} {{away at a}} much higher salary to William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal American where he drew the Yellow Kid in a new full-page color strip which was {{significantly}} violent and even vulgar compared to his first panels for Truth magazine. Because Outcault failed in his attempt to copyright the Yellow Kid, Pulitzer was able to hire George Luks to continue drawing the original (and now less popular) version of the strip for the World and hence the Yellow Kid appeared simultaneously in two competing papers for about a year. Luks's version of the Yellow Kid introduced a pair of twins, Alex and George, also dressed in yellow <b>nightshirts.</b> Outcault produced three subsequent series of Yellow Kid strips at the Journal American, each lasting no more than four months: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, was a {{thriving}} town as a borough and county seat of Cumberland County, {{west of the}} Susquehanna River, {{with a population of}} 6,209 people. The shoe factory in town employed over 800 residents. There were two railroads, three banks and ten hotels in Carlisle by the time Pratt established his school. By the late 19th Century, there were 1,117 [...] "colored residents" [...] in Carlisle. Carlisle boasted a low unemployment rate and a high literacy rate {{at the time of the}} census. It was considered a good location, as it was not in a big city. It was not so far West that the students would be able to run away back to their families. The historic Carlisle Barracks (established 1757, afterwards site of the U.S. Army War College, , and U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center, [...] ) were vacant and available for use. The military site was less than two miles from an already well established educational institution, Dickinson College (founded 1773, chartered 1783). When the first Indian School students arrived in Carlisle on October 6, 1879, they were in tribal dress. [...] "For the people of Carlisle it was a gala day and a great crowd gathered around the railroad. The older Indian boys sang songs aloud in order to keep their spirits up and remain courageous, even though they were frightened." [...] "For years, it was a common event for the people of Carlisle to greet the Carlisle Indian football victors on their homecoming. Led by the Indian School Band, the Carlisle Indians paraded in their <b>nightshirts</b> down the streets of Carlisle and on to the school on the edge of town." [...] Residents of Carlisle stood on their doorsteps and cheered as the Carlisle Band led a snake dance from one end of town to the other.|$|E

60|$|So {{they opened}} {{the door at the}} front of the {{carriage}} and four of them stood outside on the platform, chatting pleasantly and admiring the scenery, while two of them opened the door at the other end, and took photographs of the Lake of Geneva. The carriage rose and cursed them in six languages. Bells were rung: conductors came flying in. It was all of no use. Those American ladies were cheerful but firm. They argued with volubility: they argued standing in the open doorway. The conductors, familiar, no doubt, with the American lady and her ways, shrugged their shoulders and retired. The other passengers undid their bags and bundles, and wrapped themselves up in shawls and Jaeger <b>nightshirts.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The firing had, of course, {{given the}} alarm to our two regiments, {{who turned out}} just as they were, in their <b>nightshirts.</b> Major O'Mahony, who was in command of Dillon's regiment, as Lally was away on leave, luckily made his way in safety from his lodgings to the barracks, got his own men in order, while Colonel Wauchop, who {{commanded}} our regiment, took the command of the two battalions. Fortunately, {{a portion of the}} regiment had been ordered to fall in early for inspection, and this gave time for the rest to get into their uniforms; and, {{as soon as they were}} ready, Wauchop led them out and fell suddenly upon a portion of Mercy's force, poured in a volley, and then charged them.|$|E
6000|$|By morning {{however the}} {{eruption}} slackened; the internal fires had worn themselves out. [...] "Pélé has {{grown tired of}} kicking up such a rumpus," [...] Frank remarked cheerfully; and as he himself was tired of watching her, too, he proposed we should go in and rest ourselves a little after our arduous labours. Indeed, the lava was now almost ceasing to flow, and the bombardment of pumice-stone and fiery cinders had intermitted a little. We returned to the house, and flung ourselves down on our beds in the clothes we wore, too fatigued after our long and sleepless watch to trouble ourselves with the needless bother of undressing. When you've sat up all night observing an eruption, you don't much care about such luxuries of an advanced civilization as <b>nightshirts.</b> Before we retired however Kea brought us in a big bowl of fresh taro-paste, and on this simple food we made a most excellent and substantial breakfast. In ten minutes we were snoring so hard on our bamboo beds that I don't believe even another eruption would have roused us up, if it had thundered at our doors with one of its monstrous subterranean boulders.|$|E

Barney insists his clothing choice is superior, citing {{the possibility of}} attractive women coming to his home at night and seeing how good he looks, but then admits how unlikely that is and uncomfortable the [...] "suitjamas" [...] are. Marshall convinces Barney to try a nightshirt instead. Barney and Marshall delight in their <b>nightshirts,</b> having a dream about flying together in them. Barney starts wearing <b>nightshirts</b> to sleep. A week later, an attractive woman shows up at his apartment at night—but, upon seeing his nightshirt, she decides to leave, much to Barney's [...]|$|E

50|$|From the mid Victorian era {{until the}} early 20th century, {{seersucker}} was also known as bed ticking due to its widespread use in mattresses, pillow cases and <b>nightshirts</b> during the hot summers in the Southern US and Britain's overseas colonies. During the American Civil War, this cheap but durable material was used to make haversacks and even the famous baggy pants of Confederate Zouaves such as the Louisiana Tigers.|$|E
50|$|Despite being {{similar to}} a visual novel, the {{objective}} is not to date the Reyvateils, but to help them resolve their inner doubts and concerns. Doing so will allow the Reyvateils to craft new Song Magic as well as unlock new outfits, which act like improved equipment in battle. Many of the outfits are based on Japanese Moe-Archetypes from more familiar ones such as school uniforms, to mascot-like costumes and <b>nightshirts.</b>|$|E

50|$|Eleven riders {{prepared}} for the coming race, and it was perhaps again concerns for visibility that caused them to decide to ride wearing <b>nightshirts.</b> For those who were wintering at the Bell Hotel, Colonel Wilson, Algy Burnaby of Baggrave, and Colonel Hill Trevor, and those who lived locally, this was simply resolved, {{but for those who}} lived further out, they had to borrow something. One rider struggled into a pink gossamer item donated by Lady Augusta.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, the Steiner {{corporation}} purchased and {{merged with the}} Liberty Nightshirt Company, headquartered in Baltimore. The decline in demand for <b>nightshirts</b> {{was one of the}} reasons for the acquisition. The same circumstances forced the company to shutter most of their other area operations. Tax squabbles with the Borough of Neptune City led them to close their long-time headquarters in Neptune City in 1939 and move to Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania. They eventually went out of business.|$|E

The Times noted that this part of the show was [...] "rollicking fun, as well as good horsemanship".|$|E

After considering a number of other entrepreuneurial ventures from opening a McDonald's franchise, to reproducing antique furniture, she settled on fashion after a buyer at Bloomingdale's suggested she lengthen some peasant blouses sent to her from her native Philippines. The altered garments were sold as <b>nightshirts.</b>|$|E
