40|$|A major {{metabolic}} fate of l-methyl- 2 -nitro-l-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and nitrosocimetidine (NC) in rodents is denitros-ation {{to generate the}} unmodified, parent guanidinium compound. MNNG is a potent, locally-acting carcinogen. NC is the <b>nitrosated</b> <b>derivative</b> of cimetidine, an important clinical drug administered orally {{for the treatment of}} stomach ulcers. Contrary to expectations {{based on the results of}} various short-term in vitro tests for carcinogenic potential, NC is not a carcinogen when administered to rats or mice. Rat liver microsomal enzymes have been found to be capable of catalyzing the denitrosation of MNNG, NC and an NC analog, l, 3 -dimethyl- 2 -cyano-l-nitrosoguanidine (CyanoDMNG) in an NADPH-dependent reaction. The denitrosated guanidinium compound generated accounts for 50 - 70 % of the nitroso compound metabolized in a microsomal incubate; nitrite is generated with a yield which represents 40 — 60 % of the guanidinium compound produced. The cytochrome P 450 inhibitors metyrapone, n-octylamine, 1 -n-hexylimidazole and ellipticine inhibit the conversion of CyanoDMNG to l, 3 -dimethyl- 2 -cyanoguanidine (Cyano-DMG) and nitrite. Microsomal NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity is not perturbed by this series of organic compound inhibitors. Diethyl maleate at high concentrations weakly stimulates the reaction. The rates of production of the CyanoDMNG degradation products CyanoDMG, nitrite and nitrate are markedly diminished in nitrogen-saturated and in carbon dioxide-saturated microsomal incubates. Preincubating microsomes for 1 h at 37 °C prior to substrate and NADPH addition has no effect on the denitrosation activity. Kinetic analysis of the conversion of CyanoDMNG to CyanoDMG indicates a Km of 1. 0 mM and a Vmax of 2. 7 nmol/min/mg protein. Microsomes isolated from rats pretreated with the cytochrome P 450 inducers pyrazole or phenobarbital show enhanced denitrosation activity. The denitrosation capacity of hamster liver microsomes is similar to that observed for rat microsomes...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that a range of <b>nitrosated</b> glycine <b>derivatives</b> react with DNA to form O 6 -carboxymethylguanine and O 6 -methylguanine DNA adducts [Harrison et al. (1999) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 12, 106 - 111). <b>Nitrosated</b> glycine <b>derivatives</b> may be formed in the gastrointestinal tract from the reaction of dietary glycine with nitrosating agents. The aim {{of this study was to}} further investigate the role of dietary glycine in the formation of O 6 -guanine adducts at physiologically relevant concentrations. In vitro studies were performed by reacting 10 M to 50 mM glycine with nitric oxide in the presence of oxygen. An HPLC assay was developed to measure the resulting <b>nitrosated</b> glycine <b>derivative,</b> diazoacetate anion. The amount of nitrosating agent present in the reaction mixture was determined by colorimetric measurement of nitrite, the hydrolysis product of N 2 O 3. Diazoacetate anion formation depended linearly on glycine concentration. Solutions of nitrosated glycine reacted with 2 '-deoxyguanosine and calf thymus DNA to give O 6 -carboxymethyl- 2 '-deoxyguanosine and, at high concentrations of glycine and nitric oxide, O 6 -methyl- 2 '-deoxyguanosine. At physiological concentrations of glycine and nitric oxide, diazoacetate anion was not detectable. Studies with synthetic diazoacetate anion showed that concentrations < 14 M did not give detectable O 6 -carboxyethylguanine in DNA, even when a sensitive immunoslot blot assay was used. However, O 6 -carboxymethylguanine was detected in human blood DNA samples obtained from three volunteers consuming a standardized high meat diet, using the immunoslot blot assay. O 6 -Carboxymethylguanine levels ranged from 35 to 80 (detection limit = 15) O 6 -carboxymethylguanine per 108 bases. These studies provide further evidence that nitrosated amino acids may be risk factors for gastrointestinal tract cancers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nitrosated</b> glycine <b>derivatives</b> {{react with}} DNA to form O 6 -carboxymethyl- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (O 6 -CMdG) and O 6 -methyl- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (O 6 -MedG) adducts concurrently. O 6 -CMdG is not {{repaired}} by O 6 -alkylguanine alkyltransferases {{and might be}} expected to lead to mutations via a similar mechanism to O 6 -MedG. Potassium diazoacetate (KDA) is a stable form of nitrosated glycine and its ability to induce mutations in the p 53 gene in a functional yeast assay was studied. Treatment of a plasmid containing the human p 53 cDNA sequence with KDA afforded readily detectable levels of O 6 -CMdG and O 6 -MedG. The treated plasmid was used to transform yeast cells and coloured colonies harbouring a p 53 sequence with functional mutations were detected. Recovery of the mutated plasmids followed by DNA sequencing enabled the mutation spectrum of KDA to be characterised. The most common mutations induced by KDA were substitutions with > 50 % occurring at GC base pairs. In contrast to the methylating agent methylnitrosourea which gives predominantly (> 80 %) GCAT transitions, KDA produced almost equal amounts of transitions (GCAT) and transversions (GCTA and ATTA). This difference is probably due to a different mode of base mispairing for O 6 -CMdG compared with O 6 -MedG. The pattern of mutations induced by KDA was very similar to the patterns observed in mutated p 53 in human gastrointestinal tract tumours. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that nitrosation of glycine (or glycine derivatives) may contribute to characteristic human p 53 mutation profiles. This conclusion is borne out by recent observations that O 6 -CMdG is present in human DNA both from blood and exfoliated colorectal cells and is consistent with recent epidemiological studies that have concluded that endogenous nitrosation arising from red meat consumption is related to an increased risk of colorectal cancer...|$|R
40|$|Genotoxic agents {{derived from}} diet may {{contribute}} to the total human burden of potentially carcinogenic DNA damage. The major malondialdehyde (MDA) DNA adduct, malondialdehyde-Z'-deoxyguanosine (M -dG) and two adducts formed by <b>nitrosated</b> glycine <b>derivatives,</b> 06 -carboxymethyl- 2,-deoxyguanosine (06 -CMdG) and 06 -methyl- 2 '- deoxyguanosinc (06 -McdG), were studied. The long-term stability of Mi-dG in calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) was assessed. MDA-treated CT-DNA standards were found to be relatively stable at room temperature (RT), 4 C, - 20 C and - 80 C. Degradation at RT was detectable after 3 weeks of storage. CT-DNA standards were more stable in water when compared to phosphate buffer. Levels of M -dG in highly modified CT-DNA could be reduced substantially using primary amines. M -dG stability in human DNA was assessed using an immunoslot blot (ISB) assay incorporating a propidium iodide staining procedure for the correction of differences in DNA binding to the ISB filter. Studies on the stability of low levels of Mi-dG in human DNA were not fully conclusive, although changes in adduct levels were temperature independent. The ratio of the two 06 -alkylguanine adducts induced by potassium diazoacetate (KDA) treatment of DNA could be modulated using different buffer systems. These findings provided a unique opportunity to investigate the contribution of 06 -CMdG and 06 -MedG to the p 53 mutational spectrum using a yeast-based p 53 functional assay. Although adduct levels differed considerably, the two spectra obtained for KDA treatments in Tris-EDTA and phosphate buffer were statistically indistinguishable. The KDA-induced mutation spectra were, however, significantly different from that induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, indicating that the key features of KDA-induced p 53 spectra were caused mainly by 06 -CMdG. Studies on MDA-induced mutational spectra were less conclusive due to a much smaller number of mutations detectable following sequencing. The results presented in this thesis highlight some key aspects of methodology as well as the significance of DNA damage measurements in studies of diet-related cancer risk...|$|R
40|$|S-Nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to act as an}} endogenous NO donor and physiological regulator of blood pressure. However, the mechanisms responsible for the formation of SNO-Hb and those underlying the release of NO and subsequent biological activity have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, a number of <b>nitrosated</b> oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)) <b>derivatives</b> have been synthesized and characterized. HbO(2) can be nitrosated at up to three distinct residues, one in the alpha-globin chain and two in the beta-chain. A beta-chain mononitrosated species (designated "SNO-Hb"), generated by the reaction of HbO(2) and S-nitrosoglutathione, released NO via a thiol-dependent mechanism involving nucleophilic attack at the nitrosated thiol functionality of SNO-Hb; in the case of glutathione, this process was associated with the formation of a mixed disulfide. In contrast, multinitrosated hemoglobin species released NO and relaxed vascular smooth muscle by a thiol-independent mechanism. HbO(2) scavenged potently NO released from SNO-Hb and inhibited its vasorelaxant properties. These data show that the predominant vasoactive species released from SNO-Hb is NO, with HNO a putative intermediate; the presence of a low molecular weight thiol is a prerequisite for this process. Such observations have important implications for the generation, metabolic fate, and biological activity of S-nitrosothiols...|$|R
40|$|The {{endogenous}} nitrosation {{of dietary}} amino acids and peptides {{may be a}} major source of genotoxic damage in the stomach and lower GI tract. Amongst the many N-alkyl-N-nitrosocompounds and related compounds, there are a number which share the common features of being derived from glycine and are carboxymethylating agents.;Novel immunoaffinity-RP-HPLC-fluorescence methods were developed allowing the concomitant detection of O 6 -carboxymethyl- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (O 6 -CMdG) and O 6 -methyl- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (O 6 -MedG) with limits of detection of 0. 128 mol O 6 -CMdG/mol dG and 0. 064 mol O 6 MedG/mol dG in lmg of DNA. N-(N'-acetyl-L-prolyl) -N-nitrosoglycine (APNG), azaserine and potassium diazoacetate (KDA) all reacted with calf thymus DNA in vitro to give the expected O 6 -CMdG as well as lesser amounts of O 6 -MedG. The ratios of O 6 -MedG to O 6 -CMdG were 1 : 9. 73 (APNG), 1 : 16. 12. (KDA) and 1 : 38. 45 (azaserine). However, these <b>nitrosated</b> glycine <b>derivatives</b> showed large differences in their capacity to alkylate DNA with O 6 -alkylation formation ratios of 1 : 12. 1 : 137. 9 for 5 mM azaserine, APNG and KDA respectively.;As O 6 -CMdG is not repaired by O 6 -alkylguanine alkyl transferases and is likely to be persistent in mammalian tissues, a sensitive immunoslotblot assay (0. 32 mol O 6 -CMdG/mol dG) which required only 1 g DNA for O 6 -CMdG was developed. O 6 -CMdG was detected in the stomach DNA of experimental animals treated with KDA or APNG by gastric intubation. Interestingly, control animals and non-target tissues of treated animals (liver, intestine) also had detectable levels of O 6 -CMdG.;Examination of the DNA from human gastric biopsies from 30 individuals involved in a H. pylori study, revealed detectable amounts of O 6 -CMdG in 27 samples ranging from 0. 60 - 19. 79 mol/mol dG. No statistically significant difference was found between individuals with or without H. pylori infection on the basis of O 6 -CMdG levels, although the highest levels observed were all in infected individuals...|$|R
40|$|A study {{into the}} {{degradation}} of crystalline Hydrazinium Nitroformate (HNF) in isolation {{has been carried out}} alongside studies into HNF / polyNIMMO propellant degradation. The contribution of gas / solid autocatalysis in {{the degradation of}} the crystalline phase has been determined to be very low. Studies via GC-MS analysis do suggest that the presence (and eventual release) of the crystal impurity, isopropyl alcohol, is a more significant contributor to the eventual autocatalytic breakdown of the crystal matrix. Investigations into the chemical compatibility of HNF with <b>nitrosated</b> and nitrated <b>derivatives</b> of 2 NDPA and pNMA indicated that the reaction of HNF is most rapid with N-NO- 2 NDPA. This reaction between HNF and N-NO- 2 NDPA is proposed to be the principal route to rapid propellant degradation in 2 NDPA stabilised propellant systems. Analysis of a range of polyNIMMO / HNF propellants has allowed development of a hypothesis for this family of propellant compositions over a range of temperatures. The data has indicated that the degradation of polyNIMMO / HNF propellants is a complex process involving a number of interrelated and interdependent reactions. It appears that a significantly different reaction scheme dominates at 80 °C compared to either 60 °C or 40 °C. The incorporation of a 1 % anhydrous sodium sulphite + 1 % pNMA mixed stabiliser system has shown promise for use in propellant formulations up to temperature of 80 °C. Some level of success in stabilisation has also been achieved using very high levels of pNMA within the propellant formulation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Drug efflux {{represents}} an important protection mechanism against antibiotics and environmental toxic compounds in bacteria. Efflux genes constitute from 6 % to 18 % of all transporters in bacterial genomes, yet their regulation, natural substrates, and physiological functions are poorly understood. Among the 20 chromosomally encoded efflux genes in Escherichia coli K- 12, only the AcrAB-TolC efflux system is constitutively expressed under the ordinary laboratory growth of E. coli. To explore conditions and circumstances that trigger {{the expression of}} additional efflux genes {{as well as their}} physiological functions, I examined the expression of all 20 efflux genes under a physiologically relevant circumstance for E. coli, which is anaerobic condition in this study. I found that expression of an RND type efflux pump MdtEF is up-regulated more than 20 fold when E. coli is cultured under anaerobic conditions. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the anaerobically induced expression of mdtEF is subject to the regulation of the anaerobic global transcription factor ArcA. Direct drug efflux and tolerance assay showed that anaerobically grown E. coli cells display an increased efflux activity and enhanced drug tolerance in an MdtEF dependent manner, confirming the functional up-regulation of the efflux pump MdtEF in the anaerobic physiology of E. coli. Since the up-regulation of mdtEF by anaerobic growth occurs in the absence of antibiotics and drugs, I speculate that MdtEF has physiological functions under the anaerobic growth of E. coli. To explore this, I first compared the viability of ΔmdtEF and WT MG 1655 strains and found that ΔmdtEF caused a decreased cell survival during prolonged anaerobic growth of E. coli. Interestingly, this defect became more pronounced when cells grow in the presence of 10 mM nitrate, but no defect was observed in ΔmdtEF strain when cells grow in the presence of 40 mM fumarate under the same anaerobic conditions, suggesting that MdtEF has physiological roles relevant to the anaerobic respiration of nitrate. I further found that E. coli cells harboring the deletion of mdtEF are susceptible to indole nitrosative derivatives, a class of toxic by-products formed and accumulated within E. coli when the bacterium respires nitrate under anaerobic conditions, and deletion of the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of indole, tnaAB, restores the growth defect of the ΔmdtEF strain during anaerobic respiration of nitrate. Taken together, I conclude that the multidrug efflux pump MdtEF expels the <b>nitrosated</b> indole <b>derivatives</b> out of E. coli cells under anaerobic conditions. Since the production and accumulation of nitrosyl indole derivatives is ascribed to the reactive nitrogen species elicited when E. coli consumes nitrate, I propose that the up-regulated multidrug efflux pump MdtEF functions to protect E. coli from nitrosative damage in its anaerobic ecological niches. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
