5|$|The nuclear envelope, {{otherwise}} known as <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane,</b> consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane</b> is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E
5|$|The nucleus is an {{organelle}} {{found in}} eukaryotic cells. Inside its fully enclosed <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane,</b> it contains {{the majority of}} the cell's genetic material. This material is organized as DNA molecules, along with a variety of proteins, to form chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} proposal, the exomembrane hypothesis, {{suggests}} that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane</b> and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> {{of cardiac}} muscle cells were studied in 134 {{patients}} with cardiac hypertrophy of various causes. Abnormalities observed consisted of: a) increased foldings and convolutions; b) nuclear pseudoinclusions formed by cytoplasmic organelles protruding into saccular invaginations of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes,</b> and c) intranuclear tubules. The increased foldings and convolutions of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> and the <b>nuclear</b> pseudoinclusions appear {{to result from}} synthesis of <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> in excess of that needed to accommodate the increase in nuclear volume which occurs in hypertrophy. Intranuclear tubules were found in 6 patients and consisted of tubular invaginations, 400 to 650 A in diameter, of the inner <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> into the nucleoplasm. Some of these tubules were straight and cylindrical, and were associated with a peripheral layer of marginated chromatin; others were not associated with chromatin, appeared coiled and followed irregular courses. Intranuclear tubules in cardiac muscle cells probably represent an extreme cellular response to the stimulus of hypertrophy...|$|R
40|$|To study signal {{transduction}} directed towards the cell nucleus {{and at the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes,</b> we investigated the association of protein kinase C (PKC) with <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> obtained from nuclei isolated from bovine brain. By use of phorbol-ester-binding assays, significant amounts of PKC could be demonstrated in nuclei and <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes.</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> are shown {{to be able to}} activate purified PKC. The PKC endogenously present in <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> appears to be a so-called 'membrane-inserted' form: it is permanently active, still binds phorbol ester, but its activity is no longer dependent on Ca 2 + and cannot be activated by phorbol ester. On the other hand, this form of PKC can be inhibited by specific PKC inhibitors. By using histone HIIIS and a specific peptide substrate, it could be shown that after extraction with Triton X- 100 the PKC can be stimulated by phospholipid again. Immunoblot analysis with isoenzyme-specific antibodies revealed that the alpha- and gamma-isoenzymes, but not the beta-isoenzyme, are associated with membranes derived from brain nuclei...|$|R

Plasma membranes were very rich in phospholipid, cholesterol, sialic acid; they did not contain nucleic acids. In comparison, <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> had a lower phospholipid to protein ratio and contained much less sialic acid and cholesterol. 50 % of the cellular cholesterol and of the membrane-bound sialic acid {{were found in the}} plasma membranes, 14 % in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes.</b> Live cells were labeled with lalI, and the acid-insoluble radioactivity was followed in the subfractions. A good correlation with the distribution and enrichment of plasma membrane marker-enzymes was obtained. Label enrichment was about 50 -fold in the two lightest of the three plasma membrane fractions. 60 % of the label was contained in the plasma membranes, only 4 % in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes,</b> Crosscontamination of these two types of membranes was thus negligible.

5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane</b> is continuous with the {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes attached to the surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane</b> since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that perforate the {{nuclear envelope}}. These pores are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some {{to pass through the}} membrane, but not others. Since the nuclear pores are located in an area of high traffic, they {{play an important role in}} the physiology of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen of the rough ER.|$|E
5|$|At {{a certain}} point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new {{daughter}} cells must have {{a full set of}} genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids {{in the presence of the}} nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane</b> is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane</b> is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E
5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane</b> or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E

In {{the absence}} of US 3, <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> form multiple folds harboring virions that suggests disturbance in membrane turnover. Therefore, we investigated phospholipid metabolism in cells infected with the US 3 deletion mutant R 7041 (ΔUS 3), and quantified membranes involved in viral envelopment. We report that (i) [3 H]-choline incorporation into <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> and cytoplasmic membranes was enhanced peaking at 12 or 20 h post inoculation with wild type HSV- 1 and R 7041 (ΔUS 3), respectively, (ii) the surface area of <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> increased until 24 h of R 7041 (ΔUS 3) infection forming folds that equaled ∼ 45 % of the nuclear surface, (iii) the surface area of viral envelopes between <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> equaled ∼ 2400 R 7041 (ΔUS 3) virions per cell, and (iv) during R 7041 (ΔUS 3) infection, the Golgi complex expanded dramatically.

40|$|The {{qualitative}} and quantitative lipid composition of nuclei and <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> from pig and rat liver were determined. These determinations were compared with the corresponding data obtained for microsomes from the same material after similar treatments. The results indicate that, at least, by far the {{major part of the}} nuclear lipids is located in the <b>membranes</b> of the <b>nuclear</b> envelope. The phospholipid pattern of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes in general is widely identical in both species. As a striking difference in the lipid composition, however, a fourfold increase of esterified cholesterol in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> was found. In a quantitative approach the ratio of total surface area of the nuclear lipids to the total surface area of the <b>nuclear</b> envelope <b>membranes</b> was calculated as being 3. 6, a value which fairly approximates the requirements of a bimolecular lipid leaflet model...|$|R
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} {{acts as a}} barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane.</b> This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.|$|E
5|$|DNA viruses : The genome {{replication}} of most DNA viruses {{takes place in}} the cell's nucleus. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or – more usually – by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. However, viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane</b> to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.|$|E
5|$|Most lipids are {{synthesized}} in yeast {{either in}} the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid particles, or the mitochondrion, {{with little or no}} lipid synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane.</b> Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is completed in the Golgi apparatus. The situation is similar in mammals, {{with the exception of the}} first few steps in ether lipid biosynthesis, which occur in peroxisomes. The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.|$|E

40|$|The nuclear {{envelopes}} of amoebae {{were damaged}} microsurgically, and {{the fate of}} the lesions was studied with the electron microscope. Amoebae were placed on the surface of an agar-coated slide. Using a glass probe, the nucleus was pushed from an amoeba, damaged with a chopping motion of the probe, and reinserted into the amoeba. Cells were prepared for electron microscopy at intervals of between 10 min and 4 days after the manipulation. Nuclear envelopes studied between 10 min and 1 h after the injury displayed extensive damage, includ-ing numerous holes in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes.</b> Beginning 15 min after the manipulation, pieces of rough endoplasmic reticulum intruded into the holes in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes.</b> These pieces of rough endoplasmic reticulum subsequently appeared to become connected to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> at the margins of the holes. By 1 day following the injury, many cells had died, but the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> were intact in those cells that survived. The elaborate fibrous lamina or honeycomb layer characteristic of the amoeba nuclear envelope was resistant to early changes after the manipulation. Patches of disorganization of the fibrous lamina were present 5 h to 1 day after injury, but the altered parts showed evidence of progress toward a return to normal configuration by 4 days after the injury. It is proposed that the rough endoplasmic reticulum participates in the repair of injury to the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes.</b> The similarity of this repair process to reconstitution of the nuclear envelope in telophase of mitosis is noted, and the relationship between the nuclear envelope and the rough endoplasmic reticulum is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Because the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane</b> is {{impermeable}} {{to large}} molecules, nuclear pores {{are required to}} regulate nuclear transport of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA through the pores is required for both gene expression {{and the maintenance of}} chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound sub compartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of sub-nuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the nucleolus, which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane</b> in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate {{them from the}} rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane.</b> In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.|$|E

5|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane</b> {{contains}} a lipid bilayer that encompass {{the contents of}} the nucleus. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a synthesis and transport organelle that branches into the cytoplasm in plant and animal cells. The Golgi apparatus is a series of multiple compartments where molecules are packaged for delivery to other cell components or for secretion from the cell. Vacuoles, which are found in both plant and animal cells (though much bigger in plant cells), are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of the cell as well as storing waste products. A vesicle is a relatively small, membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances. The cell membrane is a protective barrier that regulates what enters and leaves the cell. There is also an organelle known as the Spitzenkörper that is only found in fungi, and is connected with hyphal tip growth.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the <b>nuclear</b> <b>membrane</b> into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E

40|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} of eukaryotic cells provides a barrier separating nucleus from cytoplasm, thereby regulating {{the exchange of}} macromolecules between both compartments. However, in cells exposed to severe forms of stress this barrier may break down, resulting in the mixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents.

GFP-β-galactosidase is restricted to the cytoplasm of interphase cells, but enters the nucleus when <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> are disrupted. For comparison, we have analyzed the barrier function of <b>nuclear</b> <b>membranes</b> with antibodies against lamin B. Treatment of fixed cells with digitonin permeabilizes the plasma <b>membrane,</b> but leaves <b>nuclear</b> envelopes intact.
