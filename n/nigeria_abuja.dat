The Federal Government of Nigeria embarked on a multi-million dollar project for the construction of a state-of-the-art stadium and games village to be completed in time to host the All Africa Games. The contract was awarded on the 18th of July, 2000 from a choice list of about 80 different bidders. Construction of the complex was initiated.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: African {{swine fever}} (ASF), a highly {{contagious}} fatal acute haemorrhagic viral disease of pigs currently has no treatment or vaccination protocol and it threatens the pig industry worldwide. Recent outbreaks were managed by farmers with ethnoveterinary preparations with various claims of effectiveness. RESULTS: We identified 35 compounds using GC-MS protocol and ASF virus (NIG 99) was significantly reduced by some extracts and fractions of the plant. However, {{the plant was}} poorly extracted by water and cytotoxicity {{was found to be}} a major problem {{with the use of the}} plant since its extracts also reduced the primary cells used in the assay. CONCLUSION: It is confirmed that the plant has antiviral potentials against ASF virus and farmers’ claims seem to have certain degree of veracity, but finding the best means of exploring the potential of the plant while reducing its cytotoxic effect in-vitro and in-vivo will be necessary.

40|$|Global {{warming and}} changes in {{precipitation}} patterns are among the major effects of climate change. In this study, the long-term variability in ambient surface temperature and precipitation were evaluated in the north central region of <b>Nigeria</b> (<b>Abuja,</b> Kogi, Kwara, Niger, and Plateau) using meteorological observations obtained from 1975 - 2008. Daily precipitation data from synoptic weather stations were carefully quality-controlled using the RClimdex 1. 1 developed by Expert Team on Climate Change Detection, Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDMI). The quality-controlled dataset were homogenized using RHtestsV 4 and the detected change points were adjusted. Results showed a decrease in cool nights and cool days (TN 10 P, TX 10 P), and increasing trend in warm nights and days (TN 90 P, TX 90 P). The trend in rainfall is variable compared to changes in temperature. The precipitation indices indicated increasing trend in total annual precipitation (PRCPTOT), and {{a significant decrease in}} the number of consecutive wet days (CWD) in this region. In general, regional changes in climate temperature and precipitation extremes were significant (p< 0. 05) and could result in serious climate induced effect...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Debates on how {{to improve}} {{construction}} industry productivity have been on and a number of studies blamed the construction industry inefficiency on the lackadaisical / indolent disposition of the industry key players to innovative changes. This study is therefore carried out to investigate the level of innovation adoption of the construction industry Consultants that played pivotal roles in the conceptualization, planning and development of construction projects. A cross-sectional study was adopted using 5 -point Likert structured questionnaire administered to stratified and randomly selected 500 construction consultants which includes Architectural, Quantity Surveying, Building, engineering and Consortium of services firms ’ consultants operating in Nigeria. A total of 285 properly completed responses were returned and analysed for the study. The collected data were subjected to Descriptive statistical tool of the SPSS for MS Windows and the results obtained were interpreted with the Rogers’ Innovation Diffusion Theory to determine the level of innovation practices among the studied consultants. It was found that the construction industry consultants operating in <b>Nigeria</b> (<b>Abuja</b> and Environs) are adopters of process, product/technological and business system innovations. This result implies that the studied consultants adopt process, product/technological and business system innovations in their consultancy services operations. The major contributions of the paper include the extension of Rogers...|$|E

This study scrutinizes factors associated with mental health among women victims and perpetrators of IPV over the 12 {{months prior to the}} study. Methods and materials: Mental health data were analyzed with bivariate and multiple regression methods for 1442 women aged 15 &ndash; 49 years who contacted Forensic Services at Maputo Central Hospital (Maputo City, Mozambique) for IPV victimization between April 1, 2007 and March 31, 2008. Results: In bivariate analyses, victims and perpetrators of IPVs scored higher on symptoms of mental health than their unaffected counterparts. Multiple regressions revealed that controlling behaviors, mental health comorbidity, social support, smoking, childhood abuse, sleep difficulties, age, and lack of education were more important in explaining symptoms of mental health than demographics/socioeconomics or life-style factors. Victimization and perpetration across all types of IPV were not associated with symptoms of mental health. Conclusion: In our sample, victimization and perpetration were not important factors in explaining mental ill health, contrary to previous findings. More research into the relationship between women&rsquo;s IPV victimization and perpetration and mental health is warranted as well as the influence of controlling behaviors on mental health.
