40|$|A common {{approach}} to designing Recommender Systems (RS) consists of asking users to explicitly rate items {{in order to}} collect feedback about their preferences. However, users {{have been shown to}} be inconsistent and to introduce a non-negligible amount of <b>natural</b> <b>noise</b> in their ratings that affects the accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve RS accuracy by reducing the <b>natural</b> <b>noise</b> in the input data via a preprocessing step. In order to quantitatively understand the impact of <b>natural</b> <b>noise,</b> we first analyze the response of common recommendation algorithms to this noise. Next, we propose a novel algorithm to denoise existing datasets by means of re-rating: i. e. by asking users to rate previously rated items again. This denoising step yields very significant accuracy improvements. However, re-rating all items in the original dataset is unpractical. Therefore, we study the accuracy gains obtained when re-rating only some of the ratings. In particular, we propose two partial denoising strategies: data and user-dependent denoising. Finally, we compare the value of adding a rating of an unseen item vs. re-rating an item. We conclude with a proposal for RS to improve the quality of their user data and hence their accuracy: asking users to re-rate items might, in some circumstances, be more beneficial than asking users to rate unseen items...|$|E

40|$|Noise {{is one of}} a {{wide range}} of {{disturbances}} associated with human activities that have been shown to have detrimental impacts on a wide range of species, from montane regions to the deep marine environment. Noise may also have community-level impacts via predator–prey interactions, thus jeopardising the stability of trophic networks. However, the impact of noise on freshwater ecosystems is largely unknown. Even more so is the case of insects, despite their crucial role in trophic networks. Here, we study the impact of underwater noise on the predatory functional response of damselfly larvae. We compared the feeding rates of larvae under anthropogenic noise, <b>natural</b> <b>noise,</b> and silent conditions. Our results suggest that underwater noise (pooling the effects of anthropogenic noise and <b>natural</b> <b>noise)</b> decreases the feeding rate of damselflies significantly compared to relatively silent conditions. In particular, <b>natural</b> <b>noise</b> increased the handling time significantly compared to the silent treatment, thus reducing the feeding rate. Unexpectedly, feeding rates under anthropogenic noise were not reduced significantly compared to silent conditions. This study suggests that noise per se may not necessarily have negative impacts on trophic interactions. Instead, the impact of noise on feeding rates may be explained by the presence of nonlinearities in acoustic signals, which may be more abundant in natural compared to anthropogenic noise. We conclude by highlighting the importance of studying a diversity of types of acoustic pollution, and encourage further work regarding trophic interactions with insects using a functional response approach...|$|E

30|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>noises</b> in videos {{are quite}} complex; yet, fortunately, most noises can be {{represented}} using two models: additive Gaussian noise and impulse noise [1, 2]. Additive Gaussian noise generally assumes zero-mean Gaussian distribution and is usually introduced during video acquisition, while impulse noise assumes uniform or discrete distribution and is often caused by transmission errors. Thus, filters can be designed targeting the two kinds of noises. Gaussian noise can be well suppressed by bilateral filter [3], anisotropic diffusion [4], wavelet-based approaches [5], or fields of experts [6] while maintaining edges. Impulse noise filters lie on robust image statistics to distinguish noise pixels and fine features (i.e., small high-gradient regions) and often need an iterative process to reduce false detection [7 – 9]. Building filters for removing mixture of Gaussian and impulse noise is more practical than that for one specific type of noise with respect to natural images. The essence of mixed noise filter is to incorporate the pertinent techniques into a uniform framework that can effectively smooth the mixed noise while avoiding blurring the edges and fine features.|$|R

Cowboys had to be able to jump on their horses at a moments notice during the night in case of such an instance. Naturally there were precautions taken against such things. First off there was the response tactics aforementioned, but Cowboys would also sing softly to their cattle while on watch in order to cover up any sharp, unexpected noises that could cause the herd to spook, and they were extra careful when the weather turned stormy.

We subjected the sympatric species E. emiliopugini to similar experimental conditions to assess its response to noise exposure.

A discrete vegetation noise model was developed and compared to an earlier model showing improved estimations, especially at frequencies below 0. 5 kHz.
