Among the peltasts, roughly 2,000 men were selected {{to serve in the}} elite agema vanguard, with other peltasts numbering roughly 3,000. The number of peltasts varied over time, perhaps never more than 5,000 men.

5|$|The 1971 Five Nations Championship {{was a new}} dawn for Welsh rugby. The new National Stadium was completed, and {{the team}} <b>now</b> <b>into</b> their Second Golden era were both {{experienced}} and talented. John and Edwards played in all four games, starting with an easy win over England. Wales won 22–6, with John scoring six points from two dropped goals. The second game of the Championship, played against Scotland, was a close encounter, won by Wales 19–18 thanks to a late Gerald Davies try converted by John Taylor. Barry John scored eight of Wales' points, with a try, penalty goal and a conversion; missing only his trademark drop goal to complete a full house of scores. John surpassed his Scotland tally in the next match, a home game against Ireland, scoring 11points with a dropped goal, conversion and two penalty goals. Seen as one of Wales' more accomplished victories, the 23–0 win gave the team a Triple Crown title, {{and set up a}} Grand Slam encounter with France. Despite the low score, the 9–5 win over France at Stade Colombes on 27 March was a match of the highest quality. Edwards and John scored all the points in the encounter, Edwards with a try, John a try and a penalty goal. This was Wales' first Grand Slam since 1952 and the 1971 squad is seen as the greatest ever to be fielded by Wales.|$|E

5|$|Though <b>now</b> <b>into</b> his forties, Lee {{remained}} a regular in the Middlesex {{side in the}} early 1930s, and in 1931 he scored 1,291 runs {{at an average of}} 30.02, including two centuries. Both of his brothers, Jack and Frank, also scored a first-class century during the season, Jack scored 113 for Somerset against Northamptonshire, and Frank carried his bat to remain 134 not out for Somerset against Sussex. The feat was the first instance of three professional brothers all scoring first-class centuries in the same season. Two years later, all three brothers were involved in a dismissal: Harry Lee was caught for 82 runs by Frank from the bowling of Jack. Though Lee passed 1,000 first-class runs in each of 1932 and 1933, he did so with averages under 25, and in 1934 he was dropped from the Middlesex side in order to encourage some younger players to break into the team. He continued to appear for the MCC during the season, and scored a century against Cambridge University in early July. He was briefly recalled to the Middlesex team in August, and recorded a final century, reaching 119 against Warwickshire. Although he was successful in the subsequent match against Surrey, making scores of 65 and 38 not out, Middlesex terminated his contract {{at the end of the}} season, much to his disappointment. In 437 first-class appearances, Lee scored a total of 20,158 runs at an average of 29.95. He scored 38 centuries and passed 1,000 runs in a season on 13 occasions.|$|E

25|$|The {{adoption}} of high power fiber lasers as an industrial material processing tool has been ongoing {{for several years}} and is now expanding into other markets including the medical and scientific markets. One key enhancement enabling penetration into the scientific market has been the improvements in high finesse fiber amplifiers, which are now capable of delivering single frequency linewidths (<5nbsp&kHz) together with excellent beam quality and stable linearly polarized output. Systems meeting these specifications, have steadily progressed {{in the last few years}} from a few Watts of output power, initially to the 10s of Watts and <b>now</b> <b>into</b> the 100s of Watts power level. This power scaling has been achieved with developments in the fiber technology, such as the {{adoption of}} stimulated brillouin scattering (SBS) suppression/mitigation techniques within the fiber, along with improvements in the overall amplifier design. The latest generation of high finesse, high power fiber amplifiers now deliver power levels exceeding what is available from commercial solid-state single frequency sources and are opening up new scientific applications as a result of the higher power levels and stable optimized performance.|$|E
500|$|MacDonald deems Lennon's {{remark about}} the Beatles' [...] "god-like status" [...] in March 1966 {{to have been}} [...] "fairly realistic", given the {{reaction}} to Revolver. He adds: [...] "The album's aural invention was so masterful {{that it seemed to}} Western youth that The Beatles knew – that they had the key to current events and were somehow orchestrating them through their records." [...] MacDonald highlights [...] "the radically subversive" [...] message of [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] – exhorting listeners to empty their minds of all ego- and material-related thought – as the inauguration of a [...] "till-then élite-preserved concept of mind-expansion into pop, simultaneously drawing attention to consciousness-enhancing drugs and the ancient religious philosophies of the Orient". Author Shawn Levy writes that the album presented an alternative reality that contemporary listeners felt compelled to explore further; he describes it as [...] "the first true drug album, not a pop record with some druggy insinuations, but an honest-to-heaven, steeped-in-the-out-there trip from the here and <b>now</b> <b>into</b> who knew where".|$|E
500|$|By the 1880s, Macdonald was {{becoming}} more frail, but he maintained his political acuity. In 1883, he secured the [...] "Intoxicating Liquors Bill" [...] which took the regulation system away from the provinces, in part to stymie his foe Premier Mowat. In his own case, Macdonald took better control of his drinking and binges had ended. [...] "The great drinking-bouts, the gargantuan in sobriety's of his middle years, were dwindling away <b>now</b> <b>into</b> memories." [...] As the budget moved forward, Macdonald studied the railway issue, and found the picture unexpectedly good. Although little money had been spent on the project under Mackenzie, several hundred miles of track had been built and nearly the entire route surveyed. In 1880, Macdonald found a syndicate, led by George Stephen, willing to undertake the CPR project. Donald Smith (later Lord Strathcona) was a major partner in the syndicate, {{but because of the}} ill will between him and the Conservatives, Smith's participation was initially not made public, though it was well-known to Macdonald. In 1880, the Dominion took over Britain's remaining Arctic territories, which extended Canada to its present-day boundaries, with the exception of Newfoundland, which would not enter Confederation until 1949. Also in 1880, Canada sent its first diplomatic representative abroad, Sir Alexander Galt as High Commissioner to Britain. With good economic times, Macdonald and the Conservatives were returned with a slightly decreased majority in 1882. Macdonald was returned for the Ontario riding of Carleton.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{noted the}} album's {{extensive}} exploration of sexuality. Having been a singer {{since the age}} of nine, Beyoncé felt [...] "stifled" [...] by the perception she was a role model for young children, and <b>now</b> <b>into</b> her thirties, believed she had [...] "earned the right to [...] express any and every side of self". Addressing the album's sexual content specifically, the singer said [...] "I don't at all have any shame about being sexual and I'm not embarrassed about it and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of me." [...] Several critics described Beyoncés sex songs as a celebration of monogamous love. [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] is a duet with her husband Jay-Z, and features lyrics heavily laden with double entendres that explore lust within their sexual relationship. It fuses intermittent trap beats with heavy bass, skittering synthesizers and drums, and Arabic-scale vocal arpeggios. Beyoncé's vocals are diverse, including a melodramatic chorus sung in her upper register and a half-rapped second verse. [...] "Blow" [...] veers from a thumping jazz beat created with sparse piano chords and guitars to a [...] "swinging electro-funk groove" [...] with elements of neo-disco. Its erotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics include a running cunnilingus metaphor of [...] "licking Skittles" [...] in its chorus. The slow-jam [...] "Rocket" [...] is a homage to D'Angelo's soul-infused [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] (2000). Described by Entertainment Weeklys Nick Catucci as a [...] "slippery, six-and-a-half-minute funk excursion", Beyoncé adopts a slow, harmonious vocal as she instructs her love interest to watch her perform a striptease.|$|E
