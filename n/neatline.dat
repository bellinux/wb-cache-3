40|$|UVA Library seeks Level II Start-Up {{funding for}} the {{development}} of <b>Neatline,</b> a tool for the creation of interlinked timelines and maps as interpretive expressions of the literary or historical content of archival collections. <b>Neatline</b> promotes collaboration by libraries and cultural heritage institutions with scholarly end-users, who will build on standard EAD (Encoded Archival Description) metadata to produce geospatial and temporal visualizations of the textual content of cataloged letters and manuscripts. <b>Neatline</b> is a geo-temporal framework for fruitful interchange among scholars and the stewards of primary resources. It builds on robust, open standards and tools, including OpenLayers and SIMILE Timeline. The innovation of our approach lies in our dedication to providing a seamless, out-of-the-box experience for users without deep Web development skills. <b>Neatline</b> is a contribution to interpretive humanities scholarship in the visual vernacular...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} how {{the usual}} study of architecture {{from the perspective}} of a single moment in time, usually the moment of its creation is limiting. New methodologies make it possible to add to the current rich variety of approaches available to the architectural historian in order to consider the dynamic history of the forms we study. This problem can be resolved in part through the use of digital tools, in particular <b>Neatline,</b> (www. <b>neatline.</b> org) which allows the viewer to see and understand how a building changes over time...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} photomosaics of {{high-resolution}} Viking Orbiter images of Mars is being prepared and published {{to support the}} Mars 1 : 500, 000 scale geologic mapping program. More than 100 of these photomosaics were made manually, but {{for the last several}} years they have all been made digitally. The digital mosaics are published on the Mars Transverse Mercator (MTM) system, and they are also available to the appropriate principal investigators as digital files in the mosaicked digital image model (MDIM) format. The mosaics contain Viking Orbiter images with the highest available resolution: in some areas as high as 10 m/pixel. This resolution, where it exists, will support a 1 : 100, 000 map scale. The full resolution of a mosaic is preserved in a digital file, but conventional lithographic publication of such large-scale inset maps will be done only if required by the geologic map author. When high-resolution images do not full the <b>neatlines</b> of an MTM quadrangle, the medium-resolution (1 / 256 degrees/pixel, or 231 m/pixel) MDIM is used. The mosaics are tied by image-matching to the planetwide MDIM, in which random errors as large as 5 km (10 mm at 1 : 500, 000 scale) are common; a few much larger, worst-case errors also occur. Because of the distribution of the errors, many large discrepancies appear along the cutlines between frames with very different resolutions. Furthermore, each block of quadrangles is compiled on its own local control system, and adjacent blocks, compiled later, are unlikely to match. Selection of areas to be mapped is based on geologic mapping proposals reviewed and recommended by the Mars 1 : 500, 000 scale geologic mapping review panel. There is no intention to map the entire planet at this scale...|$|R

40|$|Grid {{data and}} grid format for maps at 1 : 1, 000, 000 scale {{generally}} appear {{as described in}} this section. Except for minor differences, the design {{is essentially the same}} for Universal Transverse Mercator grids, Universal Polar Stereographic grids, and nonstandard grids. The maps usually show grid lines and ticks, their values, grid letters, and notes in the margin identifying the grid and the grid zone designation. Variations in the specifications for particular types of products at 1 : 1, 000, 000 scale exist. The individual product specifications must be followed. A typical treatment is shown in figure 34. 8 - 2 THE MAJOR GRID. 8 - 2. 1 The major grid is shown by full lines at 100, 000 -unit intervals, intersected by ticks at 10, 000 -unit intervals. Where a grid line coincides with a <b>neatline</b> of the map, the grid line and its intersecting ticks are omitted. However, the <b>neatline</b> is labeled in the margin with the values for tho grid line. 8 - 2. 2 Grid values appear outside the <b>neatline</b> on all four sides of the sheet, labeling each grid line. They may also label only the first grid line in each direction from the southwest corner.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} way digital {{technologies}} inflect experiences with and meanings of art historical objects. Specifically, it addresses the way digital technologies {{can change the}} archiving, exhibiting, and experience of ephemeral art. It does so by 1) providing a discussion of archival theory, museum practices, {{and the use of}} photography as a primary means of archiving ephemeral art, and by 2) creating three digital visualizations that focus on the same problematic but leverage different technologies: Palladio, <b>Neatline,</b> and Unity 3 d, respectively. These archival exhibits highlight spatial, temporal, and relational details that are often lost in the photographic documentation of ephemeral art. Alone, the archives highlight specific aspects of ephemera, but collectively in the exhibit, a more comprehensive record of ephemera is achieved. This emphasizes digital technologies ability to create widely accessible archives, educational resources, and different archival processes that add meaning to the records. Thesi...|$|E
40|$|On April 13, 2006, an F 2 tornado {{formed in}} Southwest Iowa City. Eight minutes and 4. 5 miles later, the twister dissipated, leaving more than 12 million in damages. In {{honor of the}} 10 th anniversary of the tragedy, the Iowa City Public Library {{collected}} images and stories from community members who experienced this historic event. Members of the public submitted more than 2, 500 images and video to the library for its digital collections on its Omeka website. ICPL plotted many of these images onto a <b>Neatline</b> map where users could tour the destruction digitally. This session shares the project’s 2 ̆ 2 lessons learned 2 ̆ 2 : What factors led to successful crowdsourcing? What struggles did crowd-controlled curation invite?

40|$|We {{used the}} St. John’s Anglican Church records housed in Leddy Library’s Rare Books and Special Collections to {{research}} Sandwich, Ontario’s church {{community as a}} microcosm of the greater Detroit River region. We examined the church’s Marriage, Baptismal, Confirmation, and Death records from 1828 to 1915 in order to study both unique individual lives and changing demographic trends within the border region. In addition to the records, we examined census materials, local publications, and archival material from the church itself. As a result, our presentation of our research was unique. Through the Centre for Digital Scholarship we created an Omeka based website which serves two functions; first, to act as a digital archive where sections of the record books have been digitally preserved using Dublin Core standards, made searchable for both academic and public use; and second, to showcase our interpretive research and utilize all of the functions of Omeka, including: timelines, geolocation maps through Google, and <b>Neatline</b> maps to help create interactive exhibits featuring the church records. Several of these exhibits illustrate not only how individuals within the church were connected to each other, but also how the church community itself was made up of parishioners throughout the greater Detroit River region. As St. John’s was the only Anglican church in the area for roughly a century, it served members from Michigan, Ontario, Quebec, and even Great Britain as the church was an important incentive for immigrants in choosing to settle in the Windsor/Detroit border region. Our research provides an important contribution to local history in understanding the role that St. John’s played in serving and connecting different communities within the Detroit River Region...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} was presented on June 17, 2015, at CARTO 2015 (annual {{conference of the}} Association of Canadian Map Libraries and Archives) at the University of Ottawa. Have you ever looked at a photo and wondered where it was taken? Have used an interactive map to browse historical photos, letters, newspaper articles, or pamphlets? Have you ever thought: wouldn’t it be great if we could {{do something like that}} at my institution? Or help instructors implement this in their courses? Online technologies and platforms such as Google Earth, History Pin, <b>Neatline</b> for Omeka, make it easy to display the geographic location of digital objects. In addition, libraries and archives with digital collection platforms such as DSpace or Islandora can enhance their metadata by including geographic coordinates of digital objects. But there is a catch…the challenge is determining the geographic location of a photo (or objects) and to do it precisely and accurately. For several years, the Map and GIS Librarian at York University has partnered with archivists at the Clara Thomas Archives and Special collections, to geo-locate several their fonds. Using examples from the Clara Thomas Archives and Special Collections, this presentation will challenge you to look for critically at digital objects (such as landscape photos) and look for clues {{that can be used to}} “geolocate” the objects. The presentation will discuss the core set of information, visual, and map literacy skills that are required to geo-locate objects; provide suggestions on types of information sources that can be used to geo-locate objects, and highlight the role and expertise of a Map/GIS/ information professionals in geo-location projects.

40|$|We are {{researching the}} life of Wilfred “Boomer” Harding and his career in hockey during the 1940 s as a {{framework}} through which we can examine the border culture shared between Windsor and Detroit and the segregational “colour line” in organized sport during the period. To understand Harding 2 ̆ 7 s life while playing hockey in the cross-border Auto-Sextet team, we unearthed previously unused sources such as newspaper articles, private letters, and personal mementos assembled by members of his family. While the history of organized and professional sports is an established field, we are considering how the individual life of Harding and his experiences as a trailblazer in crossing hockey’s colour line fits into the greater narrative examined by sports historians. Our presentation of this research will be unique in that we are combining traditional historical scholarship with the technological advances of the emerging field of digital history. We have created a <b>Neatline</b> map exhibit that is hosted in the Wilfred “Boomer” Harding Archive online. This archive contains digital scans {{of all of the}} primary documents compiled by the Harding family in an accessible format that can easily lend itself to academic research or interest into local history. Our presentation will showcase Harding’s activity in hockey through a mapping feature offered with Omeka software that allows us to create an interactive display that pinpoints important places in his life as well as segregation in hockey. At these plotting points, the user will find key primary sources categorized according to Dublin Core standards that illustrate the relevance of that location and time to our research. By focusing on the Windsor/Detroit area, our work makes a meaningful contribution to research on racial segregation in sports by highlighting the experience of an individual who faced this type of segregation firsthand...|$|E
40|$|Barrington is very {{fortunate}} to have an abundance and wide variety of natural resources. Given the Town’s location in the fast-growing seacoast region of New Hampshire, development {{can be expected to}} place increasing pressures on the Town and its natural resource base. As described throughout this Natural Resources Inventory, there are many natural resources, special habitats and ecosystems that are valuable and worthy of further consideration for further study, preservation and/or active management. Current zoning ordinances and land use regulations provide some protections. However, the Town can take several additional approaches to maintain and protect its rural character, and itsspecial resources for the benefit of current residents, visitors, wildlife, and future generations. West Environmental, Inc. (WEI) has prepared this report to document the evaluation of 36 wetlands within the Town of Sandown, New Hampshire. These wetlands were identified on the Sandown Preliminary Inventory Map (October 11, 2007), also prepared by WEI and <b>Neatline</b> Associates. The field work for this evaluation was conducted from February to July 2008 and included the verification of aerial photo interpreted wetland boundaries and functional assessments. The purpose of this wetland evaluation was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the wetland resources within the Town of Sandown and to identify wetlands that qualify for Prime Wetland Designation. Each wetland was analyzed to determine its relative importance within the town and the region. The information in this report may also be used as a planning tool by town officials to identify and protect natural resources within the community. The wetland boundaries identified on the aerial photo overlays are for planning and Prime Wetland Designation purposes and are not to be construed as site specific wetland delineations per State of New Hampshire regulations. The Town of Sandown can utilize this report as the basis for selecting Prime Wetland candidates for designation in accordance with the requirements of RSA 482 -A: 15 and Chapter Wt 700 of the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) administrative rules. These regulations allow for designation of “wetlands of significant value…because of their uniqueness, fragility and unspoiled character. ” The following sections of this report document the functions and values of 36 wetlands and include the supporting information used to make these determinations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problems of}} automatic segmentation of objects in historical maps, automatic estimation of map scale and {{the design of a}} mathematical framework for understanding the uncertainties associated with map scale estimates. The problems are motivated by the lack of accuracy and consistency in the current analysis of geographical objects found in historical maps, which is conducted by unaided visual inspection. Our approach decomposes the analysis of geographical objects into workflow steps such as object segmentation, spatial scale calibration, extraction of calibrated object descriptors and comparison of descriptors over time and multiple cartography houses. The key computer science contributions are made in the segmentation and map scale calibration workflow steps. The segmentation step is achieved by designing a template-supervised ball-based region growing method employing the Hu moments as shape descriptors. The automation of spatial calibration (map scale estimation) is accomplished by algorithms that detect and classify lines along map borders, searching for dashed neatlines intersected by latitude lines. Thus, descriptors of map objects represented by segmentation results in pixels can be converted to geographical units; for example, the area of a lake can be reported in square miles. Finally, the map scale estimation process is modeled mathematically in order to establish uncertainty of the scale results. The uncertainty framework models contributions from various sources of error in the digitized historical map images, including clutter such as text impinging on the region of interest, low contrast between light and dark dashes of the <b>neatline,</b> as well as other sources. The application of our work has been to compare shape characteristics of the Great Lakes region in a dataset of approximately 40 French and British historical maps created in the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries. The objective was to determine which colonial power possessed more accurate geographic knowledge of the region, and how this balance changed over time. We report experimental evaluations of automation accuracy based on comparison with manual segmentation results, as well as the knowledge obtained from the area comparisons. We also report the results obtained from experiments designed to allow uncertainty analysis of the scale estimation subsystem...|$|E
