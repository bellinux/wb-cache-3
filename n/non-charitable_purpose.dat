2500|$|In addition, {{the courts}} have {{recognised}} exceptions to the rules against purpose trusts.

Trusts to maintain animals may also be valid, as in Pettingall v Pettingall. Again, this is limited to the 21 years after the donor's death permitted by trusts law. Historically, religious masses have been considered an exception to the rules against purpose trusts, but in Re Hetherington, the saying of a public mass was recognised as a valid charitable cause.

2500|$|There are {{commonly}} {{said to be}} three (or maybe four) small exceptions to the rule against enforcing <b>non-charitable</b> <b>purpose</b> trusts, and there is one certain and major loophole. First, trusts can be created for building and maintaining graves and funeral monuments. Second, trusts have been allowed for the saying of private masses. Third, it was (long before the Hunting Act 2004) said to lawful to have a trust promoting fox hunting. These [...] "exceptions" [...] {{were said to be}} fixed in Re Endacott, where a minor businessman in who lived in Devon wanted to entrust money [...] "for the purpose of providing some useful memorial to myself". Lord Evershed MR held this invalid because it was not a grave, let alone charitable. It has, however, been questioned whether the existing categories are in fact true exceptions given that graves and masses could be construed as trusts which ultimately benefit the landowner, or the relevant church. In any case the major exception to the no purpose trust rule is that in many other common law countries, particularly the United States and a number of Caribbean states, they can be valid. If capital is entrusted under the rules of other jurisdictions the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 Schedule 1, articles 6 and 18 requires that the trusts are recognised. This follows the Hague Trust Convention of 1985, which was ratified by 12 countries. The UK recognises any offshore trusts unless they are [...] "manifestly incompatible with public policy". Even trusts in countries that are [...] "offshore financial centres" [...] (typically described as [...] "tax havens" [...] because wealthy individuals or corporations shift their assets there to avoid paying taxes in the UK), purpose trusts can be created which serve no charitable function, or any function related to the good of society, so long as the trust document specifies someone to be an [...] "enforcer" [...] of the trust document. These include Jersey, the Isle of Mann, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. It is argued, for example by David Hayton, a former UK academic trust lawyer who was recruited to serve on the Caribbean Court of Justice, that having an enforcer resolves any problem of ensuring that the trust is run accountably. This substitutes for the oversight that beneficiaries would exercise. The result, it is argued, is that English law's continued prohibition on <b>non-charitable</b> <b>purpose</b> trusts is antiquated and ineffective, and is better removed so that money remains [...] "onshore". This would also have the consequence, like in the US or the tax haven jurisdictions, that public money would be used to enforce trusts over vast sums of wealth which might never do anything for a living person.|$|E
2500|$|People have {{a general}} freedom, subject to {{statutory}} requirements and basic fiduciary duties, to design {{the terms of a}} trust in the way a settlor deems fit. However English courts have long refused to enforce trusts that only serve an abstract purpose, and are not for the benefit of people. Only trusts charitable trusts, defined by the Charities Act 2011, and about four other small exceptions will be enforced. The main reason for this judicial policy is to prevent, as Roxburgh J said in Re Astor's Settlement Trusts, [...] "the creation of large funds devoted to non-charitable purposes which no court and no department of state can control". This followed a similar policy to the rule against perpetuities, which rendered void any trust that would only be transferred to (or [...] "vest") in someone in the distant future (currently 125 years under the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 2009). In both ways, the view has remained strong that the wishes of the dead should not, so to speak, rule the living from the grave. It would mean that society's resources and wealth would be tied into uses that (because they were not charitable) failed to serve contemporary needs, and therefore made everyone poorer. Re Astor's ST itself concerned the wish of the Viscount Waldorf Astor, who had owned The Observer newspaper, to maintain [...] "good understanding... between nations" [...] and [...] "the independence and integrity of newspapers". While perhaps laudable, it was not within the tightly defined categories of a charity, and so was not valid. An example of a much less laudable aim in Brown v Burdett was an old lady's demand in her will that her house be boarded up for 20 years with [...] "good long nails to be bent down on the inside", but for some reason with her clock remaining inside. Bacon VC cancelled the trust altogether. But while there is a policy against enforcing trusts for abstract and non-charitable purposes, if possible the courts will construe a trust as being for people where they can. For example, in Re Bowes an aristocrat named John Bowes left £5000 in his will for [...] "planting trees for shelter on the Wemmergill estate", in County Durham. This was an extravagantly large sum of money for trees. But rather than holding it void (since planting trees on private land was a <b>non-charitable</b> <b>purpose)</b> North J construed the trust to mean that the money was really intended for the estate owners. Similarly in Re Osoba, the Court of Appeal held that a trust of a Nigerian man, Patrick Osoba, said to be for the purpose of [...] "training of my daughter" [...] was not an invalid purpose trust. Instead it was in substance intended that the money be for the daughter. Buckley LJ said the court would treat [...] "the reference to the purpose as merely a statement of the testator's motive in making the gift".|$|E

5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for <b>non-charitable</b> <b>purposes,</b> as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|R

500|$|The third {{sub-category}} covers charitable trusts for {{the benefit}} of localities.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{offshore}} jurisdictions have enacted statutes which expressly validate <b>non-charitable</b> <b>purpose</b> trusts {{outside of the}} small group of specific exceptions recognised at common law.

5000|$|There {{are a few}} {{exceptions}} to this provision concerning a [...] "definite beneficiary." [...] The most obvious is {{in the case of}} a [...] "charitable trust" [...] that is for the benefit of an organization that is usually not-for-profit and is intended [...] "for the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, the promotion of health, governmental or municipal purposes, or other purposes the achievement of which is beneficial to the community." [...] Another exception is the much-publicized (and often ridiculed) trust for the benefit of an animal, usually owned by the grantor prior to death. [...] Finally, a trust may be created for a certain <b>non-charitable</b> <b>purpose</b> without an ascertainable beneficiary for a certain period (21 years, under the default rules of the UTC.) [...] The most common example of a trust for a specific <b>non-charitable</b> <b>purpose</b> is a trust for the care of a cemetery plot.|$|E
50|$|Characteristically, {{in those}} jurisdictions a <b>non-charitable</b> <b>purpose</b> trust {{requires}} a written trust instrument and the trust instrument must specify a protector or enforcer {{who will have}} locus standi to enforce {{the terms of the}} trust against the trustees.

5000|$|In trust law, a {{beneficiary}} or cestui que use, a.k.a. cestui que trust, is {{the person}} or persons who are entitled {{to the benefit of}} any trust arrangement.

[...] The Code imposes several limits on such trusts. First, the trust can only last as long as the lifetime of the animal (or the last surviving animal in a group) {{or in the case of}} a cemetery trust, no more than 21 years. [...] Also, the trust's corpus can only be applied to the intended use of caring for the animal or the cemetery plot. [...] In essence, then, a court can determine that if the trust has property that exceeds the amount required for the animal's care, the court may intervene and distribute the funds to the grantor's successors in interest.|$|E

5000|$|Special {{problems}} arise {{in connection with}} the holding of property by unincorporated associations of persons. Whereas a company has separate legal personality and can hold property, with certain statutory exceptions, unincorporated associations of persons cannot. Accordingly, where an unincorporated association is formed for a <b>non-charitable</b> <b>purpose</b> (which is most often the case), a gift to an unincorporated association can fail as an invalid purpose trust. [...] However, the courts have usually tried to avoid such a result by construing the gift as a gift {{to the members of the}} unincorporated association. [...] The difficulty is that such a gift would then have to be construed as a distributive gift to the individual members, rather than a purposive gift for the objects of the unincorporated association. In Re Recher's Will Trust 1972 Ch 526 a more purposive approach was taken, and Brightman J held that a gift to The London and Provincial Anti-Vivisection Society was to be construed as a beneficial gift in favour of the members, not so as to entitle them to an immediate distributive share, but as an accretion to the funds of the society subject to the contract of the members as set out in the rules. [...] Further, it was held that such a construction would be possible whether the society was inward looking (i.e. existed to promote the interests of its members) or outward looking (i.e. existed to promote some external cause or purpose).|$|E
