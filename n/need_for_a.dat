40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} {{was designed to}} investigate the effects of forensic education and autopsy attitude of nursing students. Meth-ods: Data on autopsy attitude were determined and collected {{by means of a}} self-reporting questionnaire including 14 questions on perception of <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> autopsy and 11 questions on resistance to autopsy, the respondents being 846 nursing students. The col-lected data were analyzed by means of an independent t-test with one-way ANOVA in an SPSS WIn 18. 0 program. Results: The per-ception of <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> autopsy was 4. 06 on average and resistance to autopsy was 2. 64 on average. The nursing students taking a forensic course showed a relatively higher level of perception of the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> autopsy (t =- 5. 63, p <. 001) than those not attending such a course (t = 2. 93, p <. 001). Perception of the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> autopsy and resistance to autopsy show a negative correlation (r =-. 382, p =. 003). Conclusion: A forensic medicine course raises the level of perception of the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> autopsy by nursing student...|$|R

5|$|After {{the initial}} ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards {{satellites}} {{with a higher}} orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-Ålesund were unsuitable for telemetry with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, {{the size of the}} antenna dish was too small and the ground station's geographical position was out of range. Because of the change of ESRO's focus, the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program, and the facility was closed in 1974.|$|E

Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is intrathecal contrast and MR Myelography.|$|E

5|$|As Bristol {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 20th century, the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new station to serve the outskirts grew, and on 29 August 1927, the Great Western Railway opened a station at Parson Street, named Parson Street Halt. There were two platforms, {{one on each side}} of the two running lines. There was a wooden shelter on the westbound platform, and a metal shelter on the eastbound platform. The platforms were made of wood, with access from the main road via steps. No goods facilities were provided.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, {{due to the}} proximity {{to the entrance of}} Port Stephens, and the dangers of the local coastline to ships. Another reason was that mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E
