5|$|As 2015 began, Ruf {{once again}} {{had to fight}} for playing time; there was <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> opening {{for him on the}} Phillies' roster, {{notwithstanding}} {{the fact that he was}} one of the few players on the roster with the ability to hit for power.|$|E
5|$|Existing {{evidence}} suggests that water fluoridation reduces tooth decay. Consistent evidence also suggests that it causes dental fluorosis, most of which is mild and not usually of aesthetic concern. <b>No</b> <b>clear</b> evidence of other adverse effects exists, though almost all research thereof has been of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|The middlegame is {{the part}} of the game which starts after the opening. There is <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> line between the opening and the middlegame, but {{typically}} the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. (Similarly, there is <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> transition from the middlegame to the endgame; see start of the endgame.) Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans based on the features of the position, {{and at the same time}} take into account the tactical possibilities of the position. The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent's king. Some typical patterns have their own names; for example, the Boden's Mate or the Lasker–Bauer combination.|$|E

5|$|Waris Ali Meerza, {{the third}} Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad, died in 1969, {{and he took}} no steps during his {{lifetime}} to establish his succession. And before declaring his successor Waris Ali died. There was <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> successor to Waris Ali.|$|E
5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} been considered to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E

5|$|Clarence13X's {{funeral was}} held {{four days after}} his death. It was {{attended}} by about 400 people and {{was followed by a}} procession through Harlem. His death put the leadership of his movement in question—there was <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> successor. At that time, his followers were primarily teenagers, and several of his top leaders subsequently struggled with drug addiction.|$|E
5|$|Following his graduation, Breckinridge {{returned}} to Kentucky with <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> direction in his life. He began to amuse himself by attending various parties {{and other social}} engagements. During {{a visit to the}} state capital, he so offended one man that he was challenged to a duel. Though he obtained two pistols, he never accepted the man's challenge, and was branded a coward. The dispute was later settled in the Masonic Lodge of which both Breckinridge and the other man were members.|$|E
5|$|Free {{hydrochloric}} acid was first formally {{described in the}} 16th century by Libavius, who prepared it by heating salt in clay crucibles. Other authors claim that pure {{hydrochloric acid}} was first discovered by the German Benedictine monk Basil Valentine in the 15th century, when he heated common salt and green vitriol, whereas others {{argue that there is}} <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> reference to the preparation of pure hydrochloric acid {{until the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E

Carlisle United have dropped to last place, one point behind Luton Town and Leicester City.|$|R

60|$|Evidently {{anxious to}} get away and be alone, Edwin Drood now resumed his outer clothing, muttering {{something}} about time and appointments. The fog was reported <b>no</b> <b>clearer</b> (by the flying waiter, who alighted from a speculative flight in the coffee interest), but he went out into it; and Bazzard, after his manner, ‘followed’ him.|$|R
5|$|Maurice's natural {{goodness}} never wavers in the story. Unlike Shelley's Frankenstein, {{which suggests}} that environment determines a person's morality, Maurice assumes that people can be innately good. Maurice even forgives Dame Smithson, who stole him from his nurse. The story aims to generate sympathy in its readers. In contrast with other children's stories of its day, it lacks didacticism and draws <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> distinctions between virtue and vice.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a metal {{with low}} toxicity. It is poorly absorbed by human body when digested. Plants {{such as the}} water {{hyacinth}} are killed by low levels of palladium salts, but most other plants tolerate it, although tests show that, at levels above 0.0003%, growth is affected. High doses of palladium could be poisonous; tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic, though <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> evidence indicates the element harms humans.|$|E
5|$|Prehistoric art in Scotland is {{visual art}} created or {{found within the}} modern borders of Scotland, before the {{departure}} of the Romans from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or Medieval era. There is <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that may involve creativity often lack a context {{that would allow them to}} be understood.|$|E

But one {{afternoon}} Thomasin was upstairs {{getting ready for a}} walk, when she had occasion to come to the landing and call [...] "Rachel." [...] Rachel was a girl about thirteen, who carried the baby out for airings; and she came upstairs at the call.|$|R
60|$|Creech {{stepped back}} and laid a violent hand on Lucy's garments. She bent--twisted her neck to watch him. But her sight grew <b>no</b> <b>clearer.</b> Still she saw he meant to strip her naked. He braced himself for a strong, ripping pull. His yellow teeth showed deep in his lip. His {{contrasting}} eyes were alight with insane joy.|$|R
5|$|Shafi'i {{accepted}} {{cases in}} which he had to be more flexible with the application of Qisas. Similar to Abu Hanifa and Malik, he developed a tertiary source of legislation. The Shafi'i school adopted istidlal or inference, a process of seeking guidance from the source. Inference allowed the jurists to avoid strict analogy in a case where <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> precedent could be found. In this case, public interest was distinguished as a basis for legislation.|$|E
5|$|Surgery may {{be useful}} in those with a herniated disc that is causing {{significant}} pain radiating into the leg, significant leg weakness, bladder problems, or loss of bowel control. It may also be useful in those with spinal stenosis. In the absence of these issues, there is <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> evidence of a benefit from surgery.|$|E
5|$|The terms {{attachment}} disorder, attachment problems, and attachment therapy, although increasingly used, have <b>no</b> <b>clear,</b> specific, or consensus definitions. However, {{the terms}} and therapies often are applied to children who are maltreated, particularly those in the foster care, kinship care, or adoption systems, and related populations such as children adopted internationally from orphanages.|$|E

40|$|Extract] The "Reasonably Arguable Position" ("RHP") {{provisions}} {{were introduced}} in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Assessment) Act 1992 in sections 222 C and 226 K, and have created areas of uncertainty from the outset.

5|$|The upshot is that {{scholars}} cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the Ur-Hamlet (if it even existed), how much from Belleforest or Saxo, {{and how much}} from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy). <b>No</b> <b>clear</b> evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo's version. However, elements of Belleforest's version which are not in Saxo's story do appear in Shakespeare's play. Whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the Ur-Hamlet remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Whereas some {{acronyms}} are logical, such as N3 (N for natural, i.e. {{observed in}} natural diamond) or H3 (H for heated, i.e. observed after irradiation and heating), many are not. In particular, there is <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> {{distinction between the}} meaning of labels GR (general radiation), R (radiation) and TR (type-II radiation).|$|E
5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is <b>no</b> <b>clear</b> boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E

50|$|The {{sheep farming}} boom altered {{not only the}} {{demographic}} and economic outlook of Southern Patagonia, but also changed the steppe ecosystem. Research suggests that sheep excrement might have caused eutrophication of lagoons like Potrok Aike, and sheep might also have caused considerable erosion. The Strait of Magellan and the Atlantic coast were covered by natural grasslands so <b>no</b> <b>clearing</b> of forests occurred during the introduction of sheep.|$|R
