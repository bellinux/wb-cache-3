6000|$|We, who {{had been}} active in the guilty scene of the morning, felt trebly guilty when we saw the effect which our conduct had {{produced}} upon him, who, of all others, we loved and respected. The shock to the good man was strange, and pitiful to us to witness who had administered it. The child of his heart had deceived and disobeyed him--I declare I think, my dear, now, we would not or could not do it over again; his whole family had entered into a league against him. Dear, kind friend and father! We know thou hast pardoned our wrong--in the Heaven where thou dwellest amongst purified spirits who learned on earth how to love and pardon! To love and forgive were easy duties with that man. Beneficence was natural to him, and a sweet, smiling humility; and to wound either was to be savage and brutal, as to torture a child, or strike blows at a <b>nursing</b> <b>woman.</b> The deed done, all we guilty ones grovelled in the earth, before the man we had injured. I pass over the scenes of forgiveness, of reconciliation, of common worship together, of final separation when the good man departed to his government, and the ship sailed away before us, leaving me and Theo on the shore. We stood there hand in hand, horribly abashed, silent, and guilty. My wife did not come to me till her father went: in the interval between the ceremony of our marriage and his departure, she had remained at home, occupying her old place by her father, and bed by her sister's side: he as kind as ever, but the women almost speechless among themselves; Aunt Lambert, for once, unkind and fretful in her temper; and little Hetty feverish and strange, and saying, [...] "I wish we were gone. I wish we were gone." [...] Though admitted to the house, and forgiven, I slunk away during those last days, and only saw my wife {{for a minute or two}} in the street, or with her family. She was not mine till they were gone. We went to Winchester and Hampton for what may be called our wedding. It was but a dismal business. For a while we felt utterly lonely: and of our dear father as if we had buried him, or drove him to the grave by our undutifulness.|$|E

50|$|Bacteria {{can enter}} the breast through cracked nipples. This can result in an {{infection}} of the breast - mastitis. Breastmilk has antibacterial action and can protect the baby from infections. The antibacterial properties of milk help to protect the infant. A breast feeding mother can become infected by a Candida infection (thrush) infection in the infant and develop deep-pink, cracked, and sore nipples. It has been found safe for breastfeeding mothers with hepatitis B and cracked nipples to breastfeed. In the event that a <b>nursing</b> <b>woman</b> experiences cracked and bleeding nipples or breast inflammation within one to two weeks immediately following an acute Toxoplasmosis infection (when the organism is still circulating in her bloodstream), it is theoretically possible that she could transmit Toxoplasma gondii to the infant through her breast milk. Immune suppressed women could have circulating Toxoplasma for even longer periods of time. However, the likelihood of human milk transmission is very small. Transmission risk of HIV increases if the mother has cracked and bleeding nipples An uncommon infection in the mother, Chagas disease, can be transmitted to the nursing infant via cracked nipples. Women with hepatitis C are advised to abstain from breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked or bleeding.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} customs and {{protocols}} {{associated with the}} giving, receiving, wearing, storing, and disposing of lei. A story that originated during World War II tells of a hula dancer who dared to give a lei to a US soldier along with a kiss, leading it to become a tradition of lei distribution in modern times. To this day, leis remain a notable aspect of Hawaiian culture. Traditionalists give a lei by bowing slightly and raising it above the heart, allowing the recipient to take it, as raising the hands above another's head, or touching the face or head, is considered disrespectful. By tradition, only open lei are given to a pregnant or <b>nursing</b> <b>woman.</b> If due to allergies or other reasons a person cannot wear a lei which has just been given (for instance a musician who would tangle the lei {{in his or her}} guitar strap), the lei is displayed in a place of honor, such as the musician's music stand or microphone stand. Lei should never be thrown away casually, or tossed into the trash. Traditionally they should be returned to the place they were gathered, or if that is not possible, they should be returned to the earth by hanging in a tree, burying, or burning. A lei represents love, and to throw one away represents throwing away the love of the giver. Many types of lei can be left in a window to dry, allowing the natural fragrance to fill the room. This technique is often used in cars as well.|$|E

Further elaborate their influence on the physiology of the maternal organism and their deficiency on the development of pathological manifestations. These nutrients include folic acid, calcium, iron, copper and zinc. Folic acid deficiency is manifested by megaloblastic anemia, cervical cellular dysplasia and elevated plasma homocysteine. Due to insufficient calcium intake, excessive bone demineralization and osteoporosis occur. If a woman does not receive enough iron, the most common is sideropenic anemia. Lack of zinc predisposes, among other things, to breast disease and lactation disruption.

Such demonic child is most often called: podmeče (with the Serbs), podvršće (with the Croats), podmenek (with the Slovenians), odmienjec (with the Poles), odminok (with the Ukrainians), obmen (with the Russians), etc. According to the folk beliefs, a changeling differs from the other children by its sluggish growth, voraciousness, and persistent desire to harm or spite other members of the household. Slav legends mention the ways of stealing the human and planting the demonic child (a), recognizing the demonic child (b), and disposing of it and restoring the rightful child (c). In order to prevent the demon from exchanging her child, the mother must observe certain rules of conduct during pregnancy and in the 40 days following the childbirth. Certain measures of magical protection are also undertaken, as: placing sharp iron objects near the <b>nursing</b> <b>woman,</b> then brooms, leaving the candle to burn all night, burning frankincense in her presence, sprinkling her with holy water, etc. The legends on changelings were most probably adopted by the Slavs from the neighboring western peoples (Germans), and included in the already present beliefs that the birth of a child is a gift from the other world, and that the mother must take great care of the gift and be grateful for it. Otherwise, the one bestowing the gift may take it away as well...|$|E
