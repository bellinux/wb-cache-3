This standardization was central to Ford's concept of mass production, and the manufacturing [...] "tolerances", or upper and lower dimensional limits that ensured interchangeability of parts became widely applied across manufacturing. Decades later, the renowned Japanese quality guru, Genichi Taguchi, demonstrated that this [...] "goal post" [...] method of measuring was inadequate.

40|$|Abstract: The {{design and}} {{analysis}} of congestion control mechanisms for mod-ern data networks such as the Internet is a challenging problem. Mathematical models at various levels have been introduced in an eort to provide insight to some aspects of this problem. A model introduced and studied by Roberts and Massoulie [13] aims to capture the dynamics of document arrivals and departures in a network where bandwidth is shared fairly amongst ows that correspond to continuous transfers of individual elastic documents. Here we consider this model under a family of bandwidth sharing policies introduced by Mo and Walrand [14]. With generally distributed interarrival times and doc-ument sizes, {{except for a few}} special cases, it is an open problem to establish stability of this stochastic ow level model under the <b>nominal</b> <b>condition</b> that the average load on each resource is less than its capacity. As a step towards the study of this model, in a separate work [8], we introduced a measure valued process to describe the dynamic evolution of the residual document sizes and proved a uid limit result: under mild assumptions, rescaled measure valued processes corresponding to a sequence of ow level models (with xed network structure) are tight, and any weak limit point of the sequence is almost surely a solution of a certain uid model. The invariant states for the uid model were also characterized in [8]. In this paper, we review the structure of the stochastic ow level model, describe our uid model approximation and then give two interesting examples of network topologies for which stability of the uid model can be established under a <b>nominal</b> <b>condition.</b> The two types of networks are linear networks and tree networks. 1...|$|E

Furthermore, the numerical simulation results are validated by particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. The main goal of the study is, on one hand, the valida-tion of the numerical procedure proposed, {{and on the other}} hand, the detailed analysis of the unsteady inner flow field distribution and pressure fluctuation in the centrifugal pump at SOC. In addition, the head of the pump at SOC is predicted based on CFD results. The flow analysis indicates that there exists two eddies in each impeller flow passage, and the velocity at the volute diffusion part is very low.
