25|$|The sixty-seventh {{session of}} the United Nations General Assembly opened on 18 September 2012 and having its last {{scheduled}} meeting on 11 September 2013. The President of the United Nations General Assembly was chosen from the EEG (the smallest regional grouping) with Serbia's then foreign minister Vuk Jeremić beating out Lithuania's Dalius Čekuolis in an election. Notably, the session led to United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19 which granted Palestine <b>non-member</b> <b>observer</b> <b>state</b> status.|$|E

[...] On 10 September 2015, the General Assembly resolved {{to approve the}} raising at the UN of the flags of <b>non-member</b> <b>observer</b> <b>states</b> alongside those of the 193 UN member states.|$|R

50|$|In August 2015, Palestine's representatives at the UN {{presented}} a draft resolution {{that would allow}} the <b>non-member</b> <b>observer</b> <b>states</b> Palestine and the Holy See to raise their flags at the United Nations headquarters. Initially, the Palestinians presented their initiative as a joint effort with the Holy See, which the Holy See denied.|$|R
2500|$|On January 9, 2013, {{the first}} stamp with the [...] "State of Palestine" [...] wording was issued by Palestinian postal service. The move came {{following}} the historic upgrade of Palestine mission of PLO (Palestinian Authority) to the UN to <b>non-member</b> <b>observer</b> <b>state</b> on 29 November 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The bid was {{expected}} to be submitted on 23 September in the Security Council, even though the 129 member states that recognise Palestine constitute the necessary 2/3 majority; however approval needs nine of 15 of the SC votes, though the U.S. promised to veto the measure. It also follows Obama's widely condemned statement to the UNGA that the recognition should be bilaterally negotiated. Abbas's diplomatic advisor Majdi al-Khaldi said that though the Palestinians believed they could win the votes needed, [...] "Three {{of the members of the}} Security Council (Bosnia, Gabon and Nigeria) are under pressure from the Americans." [...] In turn, French President Nicolas Sarkozy suggested an alternative proposal temporarily <b>non-member</b> <b>observer</b> <b>state</b> status should be granted with a timetable for new negotiations to conclude in a year.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to the {{previous}} year, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas vowed {{to take up the}} issue of Palestinian membership in some form on 27 September at the General Debate, as part of a campaign the Western media viewed as an attempt to gain the international community's attention. However, Abbas did not call for formally putting the issue to a vote. [...] The move followed days of Palestinian protests directed against the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank cities of Bethlehem, Nablus and Hebron. [...] However, unlike {{the previous}} year, where Abbas sought full-member status, he will symbolically seek non-member status. At the same time, the Palestinian delegation will be half the size of that of the previous year. Following Operation Pillar of Defense, the Palestinians promised to seek a vote on an upgrade in status to <b>non-member</b> <b>observer</b> <b>state</b> in the UN General Assembly on 29 November, the symbolic date the UN chose voted on the Partition Plan in 1947, leading to the founding of Israel, and the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. On 29 November, the UNGA voted on the issue.|$|E
50|$|In November 2012, the United Nations {{voted to}} {{recognize}} Palestine as a <b>non-member</b> UN <b>observer</b> <b>state.</b>|$|R
500|$|In addition, {{there are}} two <b>non-member</b> <b>observer</b> <b>states</b> of the United Nations General Assembly: the Holy See (which holds {{sovereignty}} over Vatican City) and the State of Palestine. The Cook Islands and Niue, both states in free association with New Zealand, are full members of several UN specialized agencies and have had their [...] "full treaty-making capacity" [...] recognized by the Secretariat.|$|R
50|$|<b>Non-member</b> <b>observer</b> <b>states</b> are {{recognized}} as sovereign states, and are free to submit a petition to join as a full member at their discretion. At present, the Holy See and Palestine are the only <b>observer</b> <b>states</b> at the United Nations, although Switzerland also maintained such status until it became a member state. Among others the Sovereign Military Order of Malta also has observer status, although not as a state but as an entity.|$|R
2500|$|United Nations General Assembly {{resolution}} 67/19 is {{a resolution}} upgrading Palestine to <b>non-member</b> <b>observer</b> <b>state</b> {{status in the}} United Nations. It {{was adopted by the}} sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly on 29 November 2012, the date of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People and the 65th anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 181(II) on the Future Government of Palestine. The draft resolution was proposed by Palestine's representative at the United Nations. It, however, maintains the status of the Palestinian Liberation Organization as the representative of the Palestinian people within the United Nations system. Though strongly contested by the United States and the government of Israel, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed support for the measure. The motion was seen as largely symbolic, though it could allow Palestine to start proceedings at the International Criminal Court against Israel. [...] Its timing, following a year in which Palestine obtained membership of UNESCO and the UN Security Council was unable [...] "to make a unanimous recommendation" [...] on their application for full UN membership, and coming several days after the completion of Operation Pillar of Defense, was also noted. The new status equates Palestine with that of the Holy See within the United Nations system and implicitly recognises Palestinian sovereignty.|$|E

50|$|The General Assembly may invite {{non-member}} entities {{to participate}} {{in the work of the}} United Nations without formal membership, and has done so on numerous occasions. Such participants are described as observers, some of which may be further classified as <b>non-member</b> <b>state</b> <b>observers.</b> Most former <b>non-member</b> <b>observer</b> <b>states</b> accepted <b>observer</b> status at a time when they had applied for membership but were unable to attain it, due to the (actual or threatened) veto by one or more of the permanent members of the Security Council. The grant of observer status is made by the General Assembly only, and not subject to a Security Council veto.|$|R

5000|$|Most of {{the former}} <b>non-member</b> <b>observer</b> <b>states</b> {{accepted}} this status {{at a time when}} they had applied for membership but were unable to attain it, due to the (actual or threatened) veto of one or more of the permanent members of the Security Council. The vetoes were later overcome either by changes in geopolitical circumstances, or by [...] "package deals" [...] under which the Security Council approved multiple new member states at the same time, as was done with a dozen countries in 1955 and with East and West Germany in 1973.|$|R

50|$|Observer status may {{be granted}} by a United Nations General Assembly resolution. The {{status of a}} {{permanent}} observer is based purely on practice of the General Assembly, {{and there are no}} provisions for it in the United Nations Charter. A distinction has been made between <b>state</b> and non-state <b>observers.</b> <b>Non-member</b> <b>states,</b> which are members of one or more specialized agencies, can apply for the status of permanent <b>observer</b> <b>state.</b> Non-state <b>observers</b> are the international organizations and other entities.|$|R
5000|$|In some {{circumstances}} a state may elect {{to become an}} observer rather than full member. For example, to preserve its neutrality while participating in its work, Switzerland chose to remain a permanent <b>non-member</b> <b>state</b> <b>observer</b> from 1948 until it became a member in 2002. The Holy See {{did not wish to}} join the United Nations as a member because [...] "Membership in the organization would not seem to be consonant with the provisions of Article 24 of the Lateran Treaty, particularly as regards spiritual status and participation in possible use of force." [...] Since April 6, 1964, the Holy See has accepted permanent <b>observer</b> <b>state</b> status at the United Nations, which was regarded as a diplomatic courtesy, to enable the Vatican to participate in the UN's humanitarian activities and in the promotion of peace.|$|R
50|$|During Jeremić's tenure, on 29 November 2012, Palestine {{was granted}} <b>non-member</b> <b>observer</b> {{status in the}} General Assembly {{by a vote of}} 138-9.

50|$|In September 2011, Britain said {{it would}} {{recognise}} Palestine as a state, but only with <b>non-member</b> <b>observer</b> status, rather than full membership, at the United Nations. In October 2014, the UK House of Commons passed a Motion which called on the Government to recognise Palestine as an independent state. Also in October 2014, the devolved government of Scotland called for recognition of Palestine as an independent state and for the UK to open an Embassy.|$|R
