5|$|In 1929 Zhu and Mao {{were forced}} to flee Jinggangshan to Ruijin {{following}} Kuomintang military pressure. Here they formed the Jiangxi Soviet, which would eventually grow to cover some 30,000 square kilometers (11,584 square miles) and include some three million people. In 1931 Zhu was appointed leader of the Red Army in Ruijin by the CPC leadership. He successfully led a conventional military force against the Kuomintang in the lead-up to the Fourth Counter Encirclement Campaign; However, he was <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same during the Fifth Counter Encirclement Campaign and the CPC fled. Zhu helped form the 1934 break-out that began the Long March.|$|E
5|$|Workers first emerge between May and July. During {{this first}} emergence, {{reproductive}} males also emerge with this first brood and {{are called the}} early males. These males provide a great adaptation because they allow {{for the presence of}} reproductive males. Nests with a greater number of early males produce a greater number of workers, cells, pupae, and emergences. Although it is uncertain as to why, queen deaths are common in Polistes exclamans, most frequently in May. The majority of original queens are dead by July, “well before eggs that became autumn reproductive were laid,” as reproductives emerged from late August through September. Thus, queens must remain alive post June in order to birth future reproductives, and if they are <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, the eldest former worker then becomes the new queen. The reproductive early males produced may be adaptive for the deaths of the queens so that the colony will not die and will be able to continue.|$|E

5|$|It {{took five}} {{minutes for the}} pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed {{it out of the}} way to one side. Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Britain {{entered the}} war to protect Belgium from German aggression, and quickly {{assumed the role of}} {{fighting}} the Germans on the Western Front, and dismantling the overseas German Empire. The romantic notions of warfare that everyone had expected faded as the fighting in France bogged down into trench warfare. Along the Western Front the British and French launched repeated assaults on the German trench lines in 1915–16, which killed and wounded hundreds of thousands, but failed to make gains of even a mile. By 1916, with volunteers falling off, the government imposed conscription in Britain (but was <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in Ireland where nationalists of all stripes militantly opposed it) in order to keep up the strength of the army. Industry turned out munitions in large quantities, with many women taking factory jobs. The Asquith government proved ineffective but when David Lloyd George replaced him in December 1916 Britain gained a powerful and successful wartime leader.|$|E

25|$|Triple Eight Race Engineering {{dominated}} {{the first two}} races of the Skycity Triple Crown, with Jamie Whincup taking pole position for both races and leading home Craig Lowndes in each. Shane Van Gisbergen and Fabian Coulthard completed the podium in each race. Lowndes took pole for the third race, which saw a variety of strategies used by the teams. After using an alternate strategy and starting on hard tyres, as opposed to soft tyres used {{by most of the}} frontrunners, Lowndes and Whincup attempted to move forwards in the middle section of the race. Lowndes made contact with the rear of Chaz Mostert's car, puncturing his tyre and dropping him down the order. Mark Winterbottom led in the closing stages, having run soft tyres for the entire race, with Whincup and Van Gisbergen behind on fresher soft tyres. Whincup let Van Gisbergen through to try to catch Winterbottom but he was <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so and Winterbottom held on for the win. With Lowndes finishing seventeenth, Winterbottom extended his championship lead to 161 points.|$|E
25|$|Brunk {{racked up}} an astounding catalog of {{injuries}} during his ECW tenure, including broken ribs, a broken jaw, and breaking his neck twice. The {{first time he}} broke his neck was during his match with Chris Benoit at the 1994 November to Remember. Benoit threw Sabu with the intention {{that he would take}} a flapjack bump but Brunk attempted to turn mid-air and take a back body drop bump instead, which he was <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and landed on his head causing the injury. The other was during a match against Taz in December 1998, when Brunk took a Taz–Plex through a table and landed incorrectly. Brunk was able to recover from the neck injuries and return to wrestling, and he even wore a neck brace in his return match in the United States a month following the injury at Taz's hands; by Brunk's account, however, he started actively wrestling in Japan with his partner on a short tour a little over two weeks after that injury. Brunk departed from ECW for the final time in early 2000.|$|E
25|$|Lin also seriously {{attempted}} {{to withdraw from}} the nomination, but was <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so because Mao had made Lin's appointment a decision of the Central Committee, so rejecting the position would violate Party procedure and would risk ending Lin's political career. Lin was not present at the conference where it was decided to name him vice chairman. After Lin was named, he met with Mao and begged him personally not to name him to the position, but Mao criticized him, comparing Lin to the Ming emperor Shizong, who devoted so much of his time to the search for longevity medicines that he neglected his government responsibilities. In 1966 all other candidates for the position were removed, and Lin accepted the position as sole Vice-Chairman, replacing Liu Shaoqi as Mao's unofficial successor. After his appointment, Lin again {{attempted to}} submit a formal written request to Mao, asking Mao to rescind Lin's appointment to the position of vice-chairman, but Mao again rejected this request. When Lin received the rejection letter, he was so angry that he tore the letter up and threw it in the garbage.|$|E

500|$|The second pack, [...] "Pinnacle Station", was {{released}} as a paid download for the Xbox 360 {{and as a}} free download for Microsoft Windows on August 25, 2009. However, it remains absent on the PlayStation 3 version of the game. The pack introduces a training facility where the player can compete in eight virtual reality combat scenarios, divided into four different game types like Deathmatch and Capture the flag. After beating the combat scenarios, the player needs to complete four more to unlock a special survival mode, {{which is the same}} as the previous survival challenges but requires players to last five minutes. BioWare described [...] "Pinnacle Station" [...] as [...] "a Fight Club-style arena" [...] and originally intended to include a similar arena in the base game, but the idea was ultimately dropped because they were <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it well enough.

500|$|On 19 September 1942, U-156 {{was roughly}} [...] south of Freetown {{and the crew}} was still {{repairing}} minor damage, when the lookout spotted a ship at 04:30. The target was the British ship Quebec City, en route from Cape Town to Freetown. Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position and hit Quebec City with one torpedo fired from tube VI. Hartenstein surfaced and approached the lifeboats and asked the survivors for the ship's name. Quebec City did not sink easily and U-156 fired 58 rounds from the 37mm (1.46in) flak gun and seven further shots from the 10.5cm gun before Hartenstein ordered a cease fire. After a direct hit in the ship's stern ammunition magazine and an explosion, Quebec City slowly sank. According to William Clark, a member of Quebec Citys crew, Hartenstein made sure that the survivors had enough water and provisions and that Captain William Thomas had the exact coordinates. This account of that attack and {{the impression that the}} humanitarian actions of Hartenstein made is documented in the book by David Cledlyn Jones, The Enemy We Killed, My Friend. Jones himself disagrees, stating that Hartenstein was concerned about the survivors’ well-being but did not inquire about provisions, nor did he offer additional food or water. Hartenstein did express {{that it would have been}} his wish to tow them at least some distance to the African coast, but explained that he was <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so as he recently had been attacked while attempting to aid survivors.|$|E
