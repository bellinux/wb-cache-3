40|$|Mechanical {{engineering}} design involves intuition, experience, process analysis syntheses. In this paper, an attempt {{has been made}} to provide to identification of isomorphism among the kinematic chains using different kinematic pairs, by considering the examples of pump mechanisms for a manual hand pump and nosewheel assembly for a small aircraft. By using link-link form of the modify adjacency matrix and elements of the matrix was chosen as one and zero depending on the absence or presence of a connection in between the joints. The proposed method is applied for determining the characteristic polynomial equations of these mechanisms and comparing manual hand pump to the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> for detecting the isomorphism...|$|E
40|$|Damaged {{components}} of the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> of an aircraft were sent to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed damages to all {{components of}} the assembly to various extents. The starboard bearing was severely damaged and the outer race had cracked. Correspondingly, the orifice of the starboard half of the hub was also severely damaged and it got enlarged. Evidences suggest that the axial load on the bearings grossly exceeded the design load leading to fracturing of the outer race of the starboard bearing and its dislodgement. The axial load was such that the wheel hub moved on the axle towards right. The damages seen on the port bearing is negligible, because in this case, the wheel hub moved along with the bearing and the outer race {{could come out of}} the bearing without any obstruction. The movement of the outer race in this case was similar to that during dis-assembly of any conical bearing. Analysis showed that the failure in the bearings is secondary in nature and it appears to have occurred due to excessive axial load. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|E
40|$|The NASA early {{experimental}} {{program for}} parawing and lifting body spacecraft recovery concepts is discussed. Simple hand drawings, in-house construction, and crude drop tests {{were used in}} lieu of a thorough stress analysis. The parawing (parasev) was controlled by manually shifting the center of gravity with respect to the center of pressure; the craft would take off while being towed at 40 KIAS. The M- 2 lifting body was originally constructed with a 3 / 32 in. mahogany skin by a glider manufacturer and employed general aviation aircraft <b>nose</b> and main <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies.</b> A minimum altitude of 200 ft was found acceptable for release of the parasev, allowing the pilot time to adjust for transients incurred at the tow release. A small landing assist rocket was furnished for the M- 2 /F- 2 and X- 24 A lifting bodies to enhance stability, and landings at a maximum lift/drag ratio of 2. 8 were successfully completed. The data gained were eventually applied {{in the development of the}} Shuttle...|$|R

40|$|Microvibrations are a {{critical}} concern on satellites equipped with instruments with high stability requirements. Amongst many sources of microvibration onboard, reaction wheel and momentum <b>wheel</b> <b>assemblies</b> are often {{considered the most}} significant. This thesis presents the development and validation of microvibration models for a cantilever configured <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> designed with a soft-suspension system. <b>Wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> induced microvibrations under hard-mounted and coupled boundary conditions are studied. In particular, the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> semi-analytical microvibration model in a hard-mounted boundary condition is developed with harmonic excitations and the traditionally ignored broadband noise excitations are included. Some peculiar dynamics such as nonlinearity in the motor and high damping of the soft-suspension system are observed from the hard-mounted measurements conducted on a bespoke dynamometer. Modeling strategies for these peculiar dynamics are developed and implemented in the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> microvibration modeling. This includes a systematic approach to extract stiffness and damping values of the suspension system, considering nonlinearity and high damping from measurements. The microvibrations produced by the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> in a coupled boundary condition are studied using a seismic mass to support the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly.</b> A coupled microvibration measurement system, which allows the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> interface loads to be reconstructed by measuring the response accelerations on the seismic mass, is designed, built and validated. In addition, the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> driving point static and dynamic accelerance are measured and analytical expressions of the driving point dynamic accelerance are derived. The coupled microvibrations are predicted with <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> static accelerance, dynamic accelerance and the standard method (i. e. no wheel accelerance). The predicted results {{have shown that the}} method developed in this thesis which uses the <b>wheel</b> <b>assembly</b> dynamic accelerance accurately simulates the microvibrations observed in practice...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{aircraft}} ground handling characteristics and airport working efficiency, large handling angle and torque are requested for the <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> steering system of large civil aircraft. A following swivel selector valve is firstly {{designed to meet the}} demand for the hydraulic pressure commutating as soon as the dual actuator <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> steering mechanism passes through its dead center position. Considering the multiple objective functions of <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> steering mechanisms, those core design parameters are multiobjective optimized. A <b>nose</b> <b>wheel</b> steering electrohydraulic servo system with handling and antishimmy functions is designed for the steering mechanism. Then the prototypes of the steering mechanism and electrohydraulic servo system are researched to validate the design. Using the swing actuator to provide the load torque and ground excitation, the steering test bench is prepared to test the system working. The steering test and the antishimmy test are conducted to verify the functions of the system. The test results, such as steer angle, steer torque hydraulic pressure, and antishimmy torque, are analyzed in detail and compared with the theoretical results. The results show that the property of the prototype achieves the design objectives, such as work mode, steer angle, and steer torque...|$|R
