40|$|A novel {{proximal}} spectral-reflectance-based plant discrimination sensor {{for use in}} {{selective herbicide}} spraying systems is developed and its dynamic outdoor performance is experimentally assessed for two plants. For plant illumination, the sensor uses a new stabilized three-wavelength laser diode module that sequentially emits identically polarized laser light beams through a common aperture, along one optical path. Each laser beam enters a multi-spot beam generator, which produces 15 parallel, collimated laser beams spaced over a 230 -mm span. The intensity of the reflected light from each beam is detected by a high-speed line scan image sensor. Plant discrimination is based on calculating two different <b>normalised</b> <b>difference</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>indices,</b> and experimental results show that by improving {{the stability of the}} laser diodes, a plant discrimination rate greater than 90 % can be achieved with a travelling speed of 7. 5 km/h for canola and wild radish, which is a dominant weed in the canola crop field...|$|R

Fences accomplish several purposes, notable {{among these are}} containing livestock or wildlife raised for profit or subsistence, excluding use of vegetation within areas to be con-served and reducing conflicts between wildlife and humans. In addition, fences may offer unanticipated benefits such as vegeta-tion within hedgerow fences providing cover to wildlife, or grazing by confined herbivores promoting native flora. However, because fences limit mobility of large herbivores, fenced areas become fragments within the landscape. Fences may entangle or electrocute herbivores, truncate migratory routes, excise important resources needed by large herbivores and allow resident her-bivore populations to become too high and damage vegetation.

40|$|Globally, mediterranean-climate {{ecosystem}} vegetation has {{converged on}} an evergreen, sclerophyllous and shrubby growth form. The particular aspects of mediterranean-climate regions {{that contribute to}} this convergence include summer droughts and relatively nutrient-poor soils. We hypothesised that winter-precipitation implies stressful summer droughts and leaches soils due to greater water availability (i. e. balance between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration; P-PET) during cold periods. We conducted a comparative analysis of <b>normalised</b> <b>difference</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>indices</b> (NDVI) and edaphic and climate properties across the biomes of South Africa. NDVI was strongly correlated with both precipitation and P-PET (r 2 = 0. 8). There was no evidence, however, that winter-precipitation reduces NDVI in comparison to similar amounts of summer-precipitation. Base saturation (BS), a measure of soil leaching was, however, negatively related to P-PET (r 2 = 0. 64). This led to an interaction between P-PET and BS in determining NDVI, indicating {{the existence of a}} trade-off between water availability and soil nutrients that enables NDVI to increase with precipitation, despite negative consequences for soil nutrient availability. The mechanism of this trade-off is suggested to be that water increases nutrient accessibility. This implies that along with nutrient-depauperate geologies and long periods of time since glaciation, the winter-precipitation {{may have contributed to the}} highly leached status of the soils. Since many of the ecophysiological characteristics of mediterranean-ecosystem flora are associated with low nutrient availabilities (e. g. evergreen foliage, sclerophylly, cluster roots), we conclude that mediterranean-climates promote convergence of growth-forms in these regions through high leaching capacity...|$|R

The classical pixel to point matching problem along with the temporal and spatial resolution of remote sensing data are some of the many issues encountered. In this study, MODIS-sensor’s <b>Normalised</b> <b>Differenced</b> <b>Vegetation</b> <b>Index</b> (NDVI) time series data were smoothed using two filtering techniques for comparison. Several start of season (SOS) methods established in the literature, namely thresholds of amplitude, derivatives and delayed moving average, were tested for determination of LSP-SOS for broadleaf forests at a site in southwestern Germany using 2001 – 2013 time series of NDVI data. The different LSP-SOS estimates when compared with species-rich GP dataset revealed that different LSP-SOS extraction methods agree better with specific phases of GP, and the choice of data processing or smoothing strongly affects the LSP-SOS extracted. LSP methods mirroring late SOS dates, i. e., 75 % amplitude and 1 st derivative, indicated a better match in means and trends, and high, significant correlations of up to 0. 7 with leaf unfolding and greening of late understory and broadleaf tree species. GP-SOS of early understory leaf unfolding partly were significantly correlated with earlier detecting LSP-SOS, i. e., 20 % amplitude and 3 rd derivative.

A widespread HPAI vaccination campaign that {{started at the}} end of 2005 in Viet Nam resulted in the cessation of poultry and human cases, but in 2006 / 2007 severe HPAI outbreaks re-emerged. In this study we investigated the pattern of this first post-vaccination epidemic in southern Viet Nam identifying a spatio-temporal cluster of outbreak occurrence and estimating spatially smoothed incidence rates of HPAI. Spatial risk factors associated with HPAI occurrence were identified. Medium-level poultry density resulted in an increased outbreak risk (Odds ratio (OR)  =  5. 4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 6 - 18. 9) but also climate-vegetation factors played an important role: medium-level <b>normalised</b> <b>difference</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>indices</b> during the rainy season from May to October were associated with higher risk of HPAI outbreaks (OR =  3. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 7 - 8. 1), probably because temporal flooding might have provided suitable conditions for the re-emergence of HPAI by expanding the virus distribution in the environment and by enlarging areas of possible contacts between domestic waterfowl and wild birds. On the other hand, several agricultural production factors, such as sweet potatoes yield, increased buffalo density, as well as increased electricity supply were associated with decreased risk of HPAI outbreaks. This illustrates that preventive control measures for HPAI should include a promotion of low-risk agricultural management practices as well as improvement of the infrastructure in village households.

40|$|Rangeland {{or natural}} arid {{pastures}} of Morocco {{are defined as}} ecosystems {{where there is a}} natural or semi-natural vegetation composed of steppes, shrubs and grassland used mainly for livestock production as climate and soil are unsuitable to agriculture. The arid rangelands of Morocco occupy an area of over 33 million hectares between the isohyets of 100 and 400 mm. These areas represent livelihoods for thousands of people and protect the country from desertification. The main objective {{of this study is to}} provide scientific community and decision-makers methodological tools for assessing arid rangelands, based on geomatics and biophysics data. This study is divided in four parts: 1. The first part presents an overview of the threat of the desertification, emphasizes on the causes and consequences of rangeland degradation in Morocco, from literature sources, statistics, climate data and maps. Morocco rangelands are located in ten different pastoral zones that differ from each other by their floristic composition, soil and climatic conditions. According to Globcover map these rangelands are mainly composed by bare soil, herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and deciduous savanna mosaic / shrub or forest. The largest pastoral zones are: the Saharan zone, Pre-Saharan, the Oriental plateaus and the Valley of Moulouya. These zones are the most degraded with respectively 97, 89 and 69 % of their total area. Available information on several pilot areas shows that the Moroccan rangelands are degraded due to many factors, which include overgrazing, cultivation, population increase and climate variation. 2. The second part of the study demonstrates the usefulness of remote sensing for assessing drought in arid rangelands of Morocco. Bi-weekly TERRA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS 250 meters) data were used for this purpose. A Preliminary mapping by using Landsat TM 5 of major land cover types was carried out to extract the pasture area. A comparison of annual and seasonal <b>Normalised</b> <b>Difference</b> <b>Vegetation</b> <b>Indices</b> (NDVI), <b>Vegetation</b> Condition <b>Index</b> (VCI) and rainfall during the time period of 2000 – 2008 were carried out. Results show significant correlations of either NDVI (r= 0. 72 **) or VCI (r= 0. 42 *) with past season (3 months) rainfall. NDVI variation is a good indicator of vegetation changes and consequently can give a reliable indication on drought conditions in the study area. NDVI values lower than 0. 2 are indicative of drought occurrence. NDVI values between 0. 20 and 0. 28 indicate average weather conditions and values higher than 0. 28 correspond to humid conditions. 3. The third part presents an original knowledge-based approach for mapping the degradation of rangelands in North Africa. The study area is located in the high plateaus of eastern Morocco which include 3. 5 million hectares of arid rangeland steppes. The approach consists in using datasets derived from Landsat TM satellite imagery, lithology, phytogeographic data and field indicators. The field indicators are: the steppes composition, perennial vegetation cover, annual perennial production, grazing level and the prevalence of rangeland cultivation. Results show that the knowledge-based approach is a valid method for evaluating rangeland degradation. The proposed knowledge-based approach discriminated between rangeland categories that would not have been discernible using only remote sensing. Overall classification accuracy of rangeland degradation obtained using this approach was 93 %. This approach revealed that 11, 36 and 30 % of the study area have shown very severe, severe and moderate degradation level, respectively. 4. The fourth part concerns the assessment of Alfa grass (Stipa tenacissima) tussocks at various degradation levels of Alfa grass steppes in the high plateaus of eastern Morocco, based on field hyperspectral data (350 – 2500 nm) and digital images during fall and spring seasons. Digital images of Alfa grass tussocks were taken using a digital camera to classify of the tussocks according to their proportion in green leaves (green, mixed and dry tussock). Assess software (Image Analysis Software for Plant Disease Quantification, APS 2002) was used to obtain the proportion of greenness in each tussock. Hyperspectral data of three states of tussocks (Green, Mixed and Dry tussock leaves) were collected within three degradation levels of Alfa grass steppes (Slight, Moderate and Severe degradation) with the ASD FieldSpec® 3 spectroradiometer. Paired t-test, Normalized difference spectral reflectance (NDSR) and Stepwise Discriminate Analysis were used to discriminate between various tussock status and different Alfa grass steppes. The results indicate that Alfa grass had shown an intraspecific variability in reflectance spectra. The proportion of green leaves in Alfa grass tussock strongly influences the spectral response. The discrimination of different Alfa grass tussock status was better during fall than spring. The spectral behavior of Alfa grass tussock is problematic for the mapping and the assessment of Alfa grass steppes by conventional remote sensing techniques...|$|R
40|$|Rainfall exerts {{a strong}} {{control on the}} {{seasonal}} evolution of vegetation across West Africa. In turn vegetation, and the root zone soil moisture which influences its growth, controls the fluxes of water and heat back into the atmosphere. This provides a mechanism for the land to feed back on the large-scale circulation {{over the course of}} the annual cycle. In this study, satellite data are combined with the outputs from land surface models and atmospheric reanalysis to develop an overview of where and when such feedbacks can occur in the region. The influence of rainfall on vegetation cover is re-examined using satellite data from the period 2000 - 8. MODIS <b>Normalised</b> <b>Vegetation</b> <b>Difference</b> <b>Index</b> (NDVI) data are used to characterise the strong seasonality of leaf area, and the seasonally varying control of antecedent rainfall is assessed with the TRMM 3 B 42 precipitation product. Significant correlations between NDVI and antecedent rainfall are found throughout the year on the northern side of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, with lags from days to up to a year at some latitudes. The feedback of vegetation on the atmosphere is assessed through spatial correlations between NDVI and atmospheric temperature, as represented in the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis product. Significant negative correlations between NDVI and temperature are found for a majority of latitudes and times of year between 6 and 16. 5 degN. Similar analysis correlating sensible heat flux and temperature data shows consistency with this feedback, though surprisingly, the land models were less successful than the NDVI data in producing significant correlations with temperature during the months either side of the Sahelian wet season. These results suggest that there is the potential for improved predictability in the simulation of the monsoon through better land initialization in forecasts, though the representation of vegetation processes is still lacking if improvements to GCMs are to be made on an interannual time scale...|$|R

The indices were derived from Landsat 8 scenes over the wheat growing area across Bloemfontein, South Africa. The vegetation abundance indices evaluated were the <b>Normalised</b> <b>Difference</b> <b>Vegetation</b> <b>Index</b> (NDVI) and the Green <b>Normalised</b> <b>Difference</b> <b>Vegetation</b> <b>Index</b> (GNDVI).

On plots with a similar soil background, simple indices such as the normalized <b>difference</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>index,</b> ratio <b>vegetation</b> <b>index,</b> and <b>difference</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>index</b> were equal to or superior to more complex <b>vegetation</b> <b>indices</b> for predicting ground cover. Yield was estimated by integrating the normalized <b>difference</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>index</b> over the growing season. The coefficient of determination (r 2) between integrated normalized <b>difference</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>index</b> and final yield was 0. 86. Unfortunately, none of these indices were able to differentiate between the intensity of green leaf color and ground cover fraction, and thus could not distinguish nitrogen from water stress. We developed a reflective index that can differentiate nitrogen and water stress over a wide range of ground cover. The index is based on the ratio of the green and red variants of the normalized <b>difference</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>index.</b> The new index was able to distinguish nitrogen and water stress from satellite data using wavelengths less than 1000 nm. This index should be broadly applicable over a wide range of plant types and environments...|$|R

An object-based classification scheme was developed to map the major land-cover types using multi-temporal Système Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and European Remote-Sensing (ERS) (C-band VV) images covering the time period from 1993 to 2007. The developed scheme mapped the post-fire land-cover types accurately: 0. 84 Kappa coefficient and 90. 5 % overall accuracy. The use of the ERS backscatter coefficient contributed to decreasing the commission errors related to the mapping of forested areas and to overcoming misclassifications that occurred between forested areas and shrublands located in shadowed areas. Results indicated that the forest regeneration rate is rather slow, especially {{in areas where the}} degree of burn severity was high while the largest part of the burned area is, to date, covered by low vegetation and shrubs. Nevertheless, a gradual shift from low vegetation to shrubland was observed. A preliminary investigation {{on the use of the}} ERS backscatter coefficient and the <b>Normalised</b> <b>Difference</b> <b>Vegetation</b> <b>Index</b> to monitor forest regeneration revealed that the backscatter coefficient could provide information related to changes in dense regenerating pine forests for the first 18 years after the fire event, whereas the <b>Normalised</b> <b>Difference</b> <b>Vegetation</b> <b>Index</b> was found to be sensitive to the regenerating forest understorey vegetation. However, further investigation is needed to confirm these findings...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the ability of the}} photochemical reflectance index (PRI) to track changes in effective quantum yield (Delta F/F-m'), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and the xanthophyll cycle de-epoxidation (DPS) in an experimental mangrove canopy. PRI was correlated with (Delta F/F-m') and NPQ over the 4 -week measurement period and over the diurnal cycle. The <b>normalised</b> <b>difference</b> <b>vegetation</b> <b>index</b> (NDVI) was not correlated with any aspect of photochemical efficiency measured using chlorophyll fluorescence or xanthophyll pigments. This study demonstrated that photochemical adjustments were responsible for controlling the flow of energy through the photosynthetic apparatus in this mangrove forest canopy rather than canopy structural or chlorophyll adjustments...|$|E
40|$|Irrigation has a {{significant}} impact on regional water resources in south-eastern Australia. It is therefore important that objective assessments of the current use of water are undertaken on a routine basis. New remote sensing technologies now provide an opportunity to assess and monitor water use at farm and catchment scales. This study demonstrates the use of satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) and NDVI (<b>Normalised</b> <b>Difference</b> <b>Vegetation</b> <b>Index)</b> in irrigation performance indicators that relate crop water use to crop water requirement (CWR) in the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation Region of South-Eastern Australia. The METRIC energy balance algorithm (Allen et al 2007) was used to derive ET estimates from Landsat satellite data...|$|E
