The focus of this thesis is primarily on constructing the instability phase diagram of Sr segregations on LSCF surfaces at the experimentally relevant temperatures and oxygen partial pressures using the first-principles density functional theory (DFT). A generic first-principles free-energy functional is developed to obtain the nonstoichiometric oxygen vacancy concentrations for the bulk and surface phases. These results agree well with the corresponding thermo-gravimetry measurements, and furthermore suggest that the oxygen vacancies are energetically stabilized at surfaces for all temperatures and oxygen partial pressures, while such surface stabilization effects become stronger at higher temperatures and lower oxygen partial pressures. Based on these nonstoichiometric oxygen vacancy predictions, we construct the free-energy phase diagrams of the Sr-segregation reaction as a function of temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and CO 2 partial pressure for both the bulk and surface LSCF phases. Our results suggest that Sr segregations strongly accumulate towards the LSCF surface phase where the oxygen vacancy <b>nonstoichiometries</b> are abundant.

The structure and properties of chemically synthesized UO 2 +x have been investigated in great detail. It {{has been found to}} exhibit complex structural disorder, with <b>nonstoichiometry</b> being common, hence the designation ?UO 2 +x?, where 0 < x < 0. 25. Little is known about the structures and properties of the important bacteriogenic analogs, which are believed to occur as nanoparticles in the environment. Chemically synthesized UO 2 +x exhibits an open fluorite structure and is known to accommodate significant doping of divalent cations. The extent to which bacteriogenic UO 2 +x incorporates common ground water cations (e. g., Ca 2 +) has not been investigated, and little is known about <b>nonstoichiometry</b> and structure defects in the bacteriogenic material. Particle size, <b>nonstoichiometry,</b> and doping may significantly alter the reactivity, and hence stability, of bacteriogenic UO 2 +x in the subsurface. The presence of associated sulfide minerals, and solid phase oxidants such as bacteriogenic Mn oxides may also affect the longevity of bacteriogenic UO 2 in the subsurface...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the cation <b>nonstoichiometry</b> and {{composition}} {{range of the}} La 2 CoO 4 phase in the La-Co-O system were investigated and compared to earlier studies. There is a controversy over the cation <b>nonstoichiometry</b> of La 2 COO 4, and the La/Co ratio {{has been reported to}} be both 1. 83 and 2 in different papers. The objective of this work is to clarify the cation <b>nonstoichiometry</b> of La 2 CoO 4. Two samples were prepared with different La:Co ratio, one La-rich and one Co-rich sample. The samples were synthesised using the nitrate freeze-drying method before being heat treated at the temperatures 900 °C and 1100 °C. In addition, low-temperature oxidation was performed. The La/Co ratios were investigated using XRD, EPMA-WDS and TEM-EDS. Heat treatment of the La-rich and Co-rich samples at 1100 °C resulted in samples containing the La 2 CoO 4 phase with the average La/Co ratio of 2. 0550 ± 0. 0158 and 1. 997 ± 0. 0056, respectively. This indicated that the cation stoichiometry lies close to the stoichiometric value, but showed evidence that the compound might have a small composition range. The results of low-temperature oxidation of these samples did not show any evidence of any changes which indicated that a La-deﬁcient La 2 CoO 4 phase was formed. Changes in lattice parameters were observed, which was consistent with earlier studies indicating that the oxidation leads to oxygen excess in the compound, giving the formula La 2 CoO 4 +δ. Heat treatment of the samples at 900 °C resulted in the same three-phase composition containingLa 2 CoO 4. The slow reaction rate led to the samples not being fully equilibrated which made it difﬁcult to draw any conclusions on cation <b>nonstoichiometry</b> of La 2 CoO 4 from the data collected...|$|E
