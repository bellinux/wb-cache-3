5|$|On September 10, British troops {{moved from}} Long Island to occupy Montresor's Island, {{a small island}} {{at the mouth of}} the Harlem River. One day later, on September 11, the Congressional {{delegation}} arrived on Staten Island and met with Admiral Lord Howe for several hours. The meeting came to nothing, as Lord Howe was <b>not</b> <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> grant terms the Congressional delegation insisted on. It did, however, postpone the impending British attack, allowing Washington more time to decide if and where to confront the enemy.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{summary of the}} TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was <b>not</b> <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that {{would be difficult to}} prove. As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.|$|E
5|$|As {{a test to}} see if his gubernatorial {{authority}} was still recognized, Taylor issued a pardon for a man convicted of manslaughter in Knott County. The pardon was signed by the proper county officials, but officers at the penitentiary refused to release the man. It was feared that Taylor would dispatch the state militia to remove the prisoner, but no further {{attempts were made to}} secure his release. Continuing to live under heavy guard in his executive office, Taylor was criticized for not having offered a reward for the capture of Goebel's unknown assailant. Responding that he was <b>not</b> <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> make an offer {{in the absence of a}} request to do so by the officials in Franklin County, he offered a $500 reward from his own money.|$|E
50|$|In India for {{civilian}} people, skydiving sport was <b>not</b> <b>authorize</b> <b>to</b> play but now due to {{popularity of the}} sport in our country this sport has started getting recognition and has started {{for civilian}}s too. In 2013, Shital has given opportunity to 57 Indian students to pursue skydiving sport in India, and has trained 30 of them in India herself.|$|R

50|$|An {{emergency}} baptism is a baptism {{administered to}} a person in danger of death. This {{can be done by}} a person <b>not</b> normally <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> administer the sacrament.|$|R
5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was <b>not</b> <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E
5|$|Under Andriamasinavalona's rule, the {{political}} administration of Imerina became more clearly defined. The number of andriana (noble) sub-castes was expanded {{from four to}} six and additional roles and specific territories were designated for each group, both within the neighborhoods of Antananarivo and in the countryside surrounding the capital. These territorial divisions were strictly enforced: members of subcastes were required to live within their designated territories and were <b>not</b> <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> stay for extended periods in the territories reserved for others. Andriamasinavalona decentralized governance and strengthened the power of local administrators by creating a series of new decrees that further formalized {{the relationship between the}} andriana and the hova (commoners) they ruled.|$|E
5|$|Van Zandt, {{though he}} {{personally}} favored annexation by the United States, was <b>not</b> <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> entertain any overtures from the US {{government on the}} subject. Texas officials were at the moment deeply engaged in exploring settlements with Mexican diplomats, facilitated by Great Britain. Texas's predominant concern was not British interference with the institution of slavery – English diplomats had not alluded to the issue – but the avoidance of any resumption of hostilities with Mexico. Still, US Secretary of State Upshur vigorously courted Texas diplomats to begin annexation talks, finally dispatching an appeal to President Sam Houston in January 1844. In it, he assured Houston that, in contrast to previous attempts, the political climate in the United States, including sections of the North, was amenable to Texas statehood, and that a two-thirds majority in Senate could be obtained to ratify a Texas treaty.|$|E

50|$|Wyoming is {{the only}} state that does not allow news reporters to be {{execution}} witnesses, allowing only people authorized by the condemned. Mark Hopkinson did <b>not</b> <b>authorize</b> any <b>to</b> his execution in 1992, so there were no witnesses at all.|$|R
25|$|During his {{interview}} with government investigators on March 23, 2006, ICG Vice President Sam Kitts repeatedly refused to discuss the company's investigation. His Lexington, Kentucky attorney, Maraco M. Rajkovich,who also represented several other ICG employees during the interviews, said ICG had <b>not</b> <b>authorized</b> Kitts <b>to</b> {{answer questions about the}} investigation. Rajkovich {{said he did not know}} who was <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> answer such questions.|$|R
5|$|Successive Merina {{sovereign}}s ruled {{over the}} Kingdom of Imerina from Analamanga through King Andriamasinavalona's reign. This sovereign gave the growing city its current name; he established the Andohalo town square {{outside the town}} gate, where all successive sovereigns delivered their royal speeches and announcements to the public, and assigned the names of numerous locations within the city based on the names of similar sites in the nearby village of Antananarivokely. Andriamasinavalona designated specific territories for the hova (commoners) and each andriana (noble) subcaste, both within the neighborhoods of Antananarivo and in the countryside surrounding the capital. These territorial divisions were strictly enforced; members of subcastes were required to live within their designated territories and were <b>not</b> <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> stay for extended periods in the territories reserved for others. Numerous fady (taboos), including injunctions against the construction of wooden houses by non-nobles {{and the presence of}} swine within the city limits, were imposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that the election is void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny– that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers– {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was <b>not</b> <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he or she was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E

25|$|There were {{unconfirmed}} rumours in February 2008 that Cardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz Ossa, the Archbishop of Santiago, Chile {{ordered the}} Institute to cease celebrating the Tridentine Mass {{and leave the}} country. It is <b>not</b> <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> celebrate the Tridentine Mass publicly in Santiago and his celebrations are therefore of private character, as permitted by the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum.|$|E

Parliament is <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> legislate to regulate {{the conduct of the}} Ombudsman's business.|$|R
25|$|Shortly {{after this}} {{propaganda}} trip through Norway, the consular activities of Thomas {{came to an}} end.

Consequently, he resigned and left for {{his home state of}} Maine.|$|E
25|$|Common school districts, {{established}} in 1812, {{were the first}} type of school district in the state. In July 2004, there were only 11 such districts remaining. They are <b>not</b> <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> provide secondary education. They must, therefore, contract with neighboring school districts to provide high school education for pupils in the district. Typically one trustee or a three-person board of trustees will govern the district.|$|E

The levy to support fire protection districts is part of the town levy and the oversight of the district is via the town board.|$|E
