40|$|From 1996 – 1998 I {{estimated}} {{the density of}} <b>prairie</b> <b>skinks</b> (Eumeces septentrionalis) in old fields and evaluated the influence of habitat characteristics on density. I estimated <b>prairie</b> <b>skink</b> density from a trapping grid using a mark-recapture method in seven old fields. For each field I estimated arthropod density, percent plant cover and recorded field age and if the field had been burned in the last 5 y. Arthropod density was highly variable among years and fields. Percent plant cover did not explain this variation, as it varied little among fields and years. <b>Prairie</b> <b>skink</b> density ranged from 58 – 206 adults per ha among fields and was significantly correlated with field age, arthropod abundance and burn treatment. Because of {{the small number of}} replicated sampling units, however, I was unable to determine the independent effects of each factor. <b>Prairie</b> <b>skink</b> density increased with successional age but the mechanisms responsible for this pattern remain unclear...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{initiatives}} in wetlands restoration offer {{a unique opportunity}} to utilize restored or constructed wetlands as nutrient sinks for non-point source pollution in regions of row-crop agriculture. The research presented here addressed the transformation and fate of nitrate in <b>northern</b> <b>prairie</b> wetlands. A combination of wetland mesocosms and microcosms was utilized to conduct controlled and replicated experiments involving nitrate transformations with the overall objectives: (1) to estimate the capacities of restored or natural <b>northern</b> <b>prairie</b> wetlands to transform nitrate, (2) to determine the fate of transformed nitrate, and (3) to begin to identify the factors which limit the sustained abilities of <b>northern</b> <b>prairie</b> wetlands to remove nitrate;Results demonstrate the considerable capacity of <b>northern</b> <b>prairie</b> wetlands to transform nitrate. Even under highly aerobic conditions, nitrate concentrations declined rapidly in all of the mesocosm and microcosm experiments. Rates of nitrate loss on a sediment area basis often exceeded one gram NO[subscript] 3 [superscript] [...] N m[superscript]- 2 day[superscript]- 1 in the presence of several mg NO[subscript] 3 [superscript] [...] N L[superscript]- 1 and are among the highest recorded in any wetland system. Observed nitrate loss rates are clearly a function of the concentration of nitrate in the overlying water over a wide range of concentrations. Increases in the nitrate concentration of the overlying water stimulate denitrification by increasing the nitrate diffusion gradient, resulting in a higher nitrate transport rate to anaerobic zones;[superscript] 15 N tracer studies confirm denitrification to be the dominant fate of externally loaded nitrate in <b>northern</b> <b>prairie</b> wetlands, generally accounting for near 80 % of the [superscript] 15 NO[subscript] 3 [superscript]- removed for the overlying water in both experimental wetland mesocosms and microcosms. The balance of the [superscript] 15 NO[subscript] 3 [superscript]- removed was immobilized within the live cattail fractions and their associated microbes or in the sediment and submersed litter;Plant litter {{plays an important role in}} the transformation and fate of nitrate. Measurements of dissolved oxygen profiles using microelectrodes demonstrate that the cattail litter provided anaerobic microzones necessary for nitrate reduction. Both field and laboratory experiments confirmed the promotion of nitrate reduction by plant litter, with observed nitrate loss rates at least twice as high in the presence of cattail litter in addition to wetland sediment...|$|R

40|$|On 8 June 1984, at the {{intersection}} of California Street and the Union Pacific RR tracks, just west of Saddle Creek Road in Omaha, a Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscala) was seen flying approximately 2 m above the observer, with a large adult <b>prairie</b> <b>skink,</b> (Eumeces septentrionalis) (Reptilia; Sauria) in its bill. The Grackle had difficulty flying, since the skink was somewhat heavy and struggling violently, The Grackle dropped to the ground about 7 m away and released the lizard. The skink lay on its back, twitching slightly. The distal half of its tail was missing. The lack of male breeding colors and presence of a relatively stout abdomen during this season indicated that it was a gravid female. When I approached to within 3 m of the Grackle, it immediately grabbed the skink and flew away. This observation occurred at 1315. It is not known if the lizard was eventually ingested...|$|R
40|$|This book {{provides}} an exceptionally thorough technical {{review of the}} ecology of both shallow and deepwater wetland systems within the prairie pothole region of the United States and Canada and the Sandhills region of Nebraska.

The book consists of 11 chapters that address key wetland components such as hydrology, water chemistry, vegetation, waterfowl, mammals, fish, and food chain support with primary focus on the prairie pothole region.

40|$|Abstract: We used {{satellite}} platform transmitting transmitters (PTTs) in 1998 – 2000 to track {{spring and fall}} migratory movements of Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) captured at Long Point, Ontario. Migration corridors reported here corroborated those identified in previous studies using alphanumerically coded neck collars. However, PTTs provided additional information on duration of spring and fall migrations, duration of stay in different staging re-gions, time spent on breeding and wintering areas, and migration speed. Birds migrated between the Atlantic coast and <b>northern</b> <b>prairies</b> along a narrow geographic corridor through portions of the southern Great Lakes. From the <b>northern</b> <b>prairies,</b> swans followed 3 corridors to breeding areas {{on the west coast}} of Hudson Bay, central High Arctic, and Mac-kenzie River delta. While swans spent considerable time on Great Lakes (27 % of spring migration) and <b>northern</b> <b>prairie</b> (40 %) staging areas in spring, the northern boreal forest was an important fall staging area (48 % of fall migration). Tundra Swans spent 20 % of the annual cycle on wintering areas, 28 % on spring staging areas, 29 % on breeding areas, and 23 % on fall staging areas. The long duration of migration and the fact that birds spend half their lives on staging areas underscore the importance of conserving Tundra Swan migratory habitats. Thirty-gram neck-collar-attached PTTs were more suitable than 95 -g Teflon-harness-attached backpack PTTs for tracking Tundra Swans.
