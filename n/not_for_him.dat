5|$|Charles Cruft {{was born}} on 28 June 1852, one of four children. In his youth, Charles {{attended}} Ardingly College in Sussex, and Birkbeck College in London. Cruft first followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a manufacturing jeweller but he ultimately decided that the career was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and left the business in 1865.|$|E
5|$|He knew {{he wanted}} to become a {{professional}} wrestler at the age of twelve and said he performed a wrestling routine in his high school's talent show, complete with fake blood. Hickenbottom was already an athlete; his career began at the age of six when he started playing football. He was a stand-out linebacker at Randolph High School on Randolph Air Force Base and eventually became captain of the football team. After graduating, Hickenbottom attended Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, but soon realized that college life was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He then began pursuing a career in professional wrestling.|$|E
5|$|The three {{families}} travel to a dude ranch in Wyoming. In the Pritchett family storyline, Gloria (Sofía Vergara) experiences hearing difficulty following the plane ride while a cowboy, Hank (Tim Blake Nelson), flirts with her. Gloria's husband, Jay (Ed O'Neill), takes notice, but Gloria is oblivious to his behavior. Later, Hank grabs Gloria's butt causing Jay {{to tell him}} to back off, which he does. He said if it were <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> being the bad guy Jay would not have been a hero, but Gloria fights back and says Jay is always a hero.|$|E

25|$|The {{son of a}} miner, {{he gained}} the {{nickname}} 'Dickie' at school. He lives in the South Yorkshire village of Staincross. Bird failed his 11-plus and went to Raley Secondary Modern School, leaving in 1948 {{at the age of}} 15. For a while, he worked at a coal mine on the surface, but gave it up, deciding it was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Instead, he set out for a career in sport.|$|E
25|$|Initially, after {{feeling that}} Penny was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> Leonard turned his {{attention}} to fellow scientist Leslie Winkle. The first time Leonard asks Leslie out, she rejects him, and his further relationships with her proved to be only short-lived casual sexual encounters that only happened to satisfy Leslie's libido. Leslie briefly started dating Leonard in Season 2, but when he failed to back her up in an argument with Sheldon, she dumped him.|$|E
25|$|Ian Raymond Lomax (30 July 1931 – 31 July 1996) played cricket {{for more}} than 20 years for Wiltshire in the Minor Counties and latterly in List A cricket, and also played in {{first-class}} matches {{for a variety of}} amateur sides, including the Free Foresters and MCC. In 1962, he played in half a dozen first-class games for Somerset, but the life of a day-to-day county cricketer was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He was born in Fulham, London and died at Deane, Hampshire.|$|E

25|$|Nicholas Mikhailovich {{had no real}} {{military}} talent or inclination towards army life. He loved {{education and}} begged his father {{to allow him to}} enter the University, but Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich was firmly opposed. To please his father Nicholas entered the Academy of the General Staff (War College) where he excelled in his studies. Military life was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as he much preferred studying butterflies and historical research. Entering the military, as all Romanovs did, the grand duke eventually became hostile towards it and was in fact the only family member ever to formally leave military service.|$|E
25|$|Baruto won the jūryō {{division}} March 2006 honbasho tournament with {{a perfect}} 15–0 result. This was only the fourth time ever that a jūryō wrestler has won the championship with such a record. He {{was the first to}} achieve this since Kitanofuji, who ultimately reached the top yokozuna rank, in 1963. As a result of this performance he was promoted to makuuchi, the highest division, {{for the first time in}} his career in May 2006. It is likely that Baruto could have achieved a more rapid rise to the top division, were it <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> suffering from appendicitis in November 2005, the resulting absence from the tournament sending him back down to the third-highest makushita division temporarily. Despite this, his rise to the top division in two years is equal to the second-fastest ever.|$|E
25|$|A new villainous Star Sapphire {{debuted in}} Green Lantern Vol 5 #21 (August 2013). Prixiam Nol-Anj {{was a former}} {{prisoner}} of the Oan sciencells, imprisoned for a slew of different crimes: racketeering, smuggling, extortion, murder for hire, abduction, trafficking in organisms, larceny, grand theft starship, and assault with an energy weapon. Over time, she uses her wiles to beguile her guard, a Green Lantern named Cossite, and he {{falls in love with}} her. When Larfleeze attacks Oa {{in the aftermath of the}} First Lantern's defeat and the death of the Guardians, his constructs kill a Star Sapphire who arrived to aid in the defense of the planet. The fallen Sapphire's ring flies to Nol-Anj's cell, where it declares her eligible to become a Star Sapphire herself. Nol-Anj persuades Cossite that the ring's presence is proof that her love for him is true, and he readily opens the door and allows her to slip the ring onto her fingers and acquire its power. To his understandable shock, she then kills him, declaring that the love in her heart that the ring detected was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> but for the Clann she belonged to, that accepted her when no one else would.|$|E
60|$|They made polite {{efforts to}} detain him, but James fancied they were <b>not</b> sorry <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to go.|$|R
60|$|So, {{there it}} was! <b>Not</b> good <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to have {{pleasure}} {{and what he}} chiefly cared about; to try and put off feeling the inevitable end of all things, the approach of death with its stealthy, rustling footsteps. <b>Not</b> good <b>for</b> <b>him!</b> <b>Not</b> even she could see how she was his new lease of interest in life, the incarnation of all the beauty he felt slipping from him.|$|R

25|$|Seeking {{refuge from}} the waswās means that the seeker after refuge himself seeks God's refuge from its evil, i.e. from the evil lest it should whisper some evil {{suggestion}} into his own heart. The second meaning is that the caller to truth seeks God's {{refuge from the}} evil {{of the one who}} whispers evil suggestions into the hearts of the people against himself. It is not in his own power to approach all the people in whose hearts evil suggestions are being whispered against himself individually and remove the misunderstandings of every person. It is also not right and proper for him that he should give up his mission of inviting others to God and should devote all his tune and energy to removing the misunderstanding created by the whisperer and to answering their accusations. It is also below his dignity that he should stoop to the level of his opponents. Therefore, God has instructed the caller to truth to seek only His refuge from the evil of the wicked people, and then to attend single-mindedly to his work of invitation and mission. For it is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to deal with them but for God, who is Sustainer of men, King of men, God of men.|$|E
500|$|Lê Đức Thọ is {{the only}} person to ever refuse to accept a Nobel Peace Prize. He was jointly awarded the 1973 award with Henry Kissinger but {{declined}} the prize on grounds that such [...] "bourgeois sentimentalities" [...] were <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and that the Paris Peace Accords were not being adhered to in full.|$|E
500|$|The drafter of the Malayan ISA was Hugh Hickling, a British lawyer, {{author and}} professor. In 1989, he commented that he [...] "could not imagine {{then that the}} time would come when the power of detention, {{carefully}} and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution, would be used against political opponents, welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent, peaceful activities". Nonetheless, he commented that he supported review of the ISA but it was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to say if the law should be scrapped, as [...] "you've got a multi-racial society [...] in which emotions can run high very quickly".|$|E

500|$|In a short poem, [...] "Mea culpa", {{published}} in 1890 Saint-Saëns accused himself {{of lack of}} decadence, and commented approvingly on the excessive enthusiasms of youth, lamenting that such things were <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, [...] "His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day." [...] The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form. The critic Henry Colles, wrote, {{a few days after}} the composer's death: ...|$|E
500|$|The story {{develops}} into a Kafkaesque nightmare as Bergman, {{besieged by}} autograph hunters, finally decides that Hollywood is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Unable {{to get an}} international line to call Sweden, he tries to escape on foot, pursued by hotel staff, police cars and helicopters [...] "like an actor in a bad, big-budget Hollywood action film". He evades his captors and reaches the seashore, where he prays for deliverance and at last meets the angelic figure of Greta Garbo, who guides him [...] "home to somewhere monochrome, but somewhere {{you will be a}} certain kind of free". A circular plot device concludes and resolves the fantasy.|$|E
500|$|Innis {{attended}} the one-room schoolhouse in Otterville and the community's high school. He travelled [...] by train to Woodstock, Ontario, {{to complete his}} secondary education at a Baptist-run college. He intended to become a public-school teacher and passed the entrance examinations for teacher training, but {{decided to take a}} year off to earn the money he would need to support himself at an Ontario teachers' college. At age 18, therefore, he returned to the one-room schoolhouse at Otterville to teach for one term until the local school board could recruit a fully qualified teacher. The experience made him realize that the life of a teacher in a small, rural school was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|According to the New Straits Times, Hickling {{later wrote}} in 1989, [...] "I {{could not imagine}} then that the time would come when the power of detention, {{carefully}} and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution, would be used against political opponents, welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent, peaceful activities." [...] However, he commented that it was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to say if the Internal Security Act should be scrapped. [...] "As a lawyer, I'm all for its review but on {{whether it should be}} scrapped, I don't know. You've got a multi-racial society [...] in which emotions can run high very quickly." [...] Interviewed on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio programme PM in April 2001, Hickling agreed with the interviewer, Geoff Thompson, that he supported the law's continued existence and said he was [...] "sorry to say that, in the light of my own experience, I'm inclined to think you couldn't really safely get rid of it at the moment". Worldwide terrorist attacks such as 9/11 confirmed his views on the matter.|$|E
500|$|According to writer Joseph Maddrey, [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] shares themes {{with his}} more famous {{conversion}} poem [...] "Ash Wednesday", the first parts of which Eliot was writing when [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] was written and published. Eliot uses the biblical story of Simeon {{to illustrate the}} [...] "contrast between appearance and reality and humbly begs God to teach him the stillness that unifies the two". Eliot's Ariel poems and [...] "Ash Wednesday" [...] explore this new experience of conversion and {{the progress of the}} soul. Scofield writes that Eliot's depiction of Simeon presents [...] "a figure to whom revelation has been granted but to whom it has come too late for this life". [...] But as he awaits the death for which he asks, Simeon sees the consequences of the turning of faith to this new child and his mission. Simeon wants nothing of this [...] "time of sorrow" [...] and that the fate of persecution for the consequences of faith is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
500|$|Realizing {{he wanted}} to start a band from scratch, Santos placed an ad for a drummer on the social {{networking}} website MySpace. After receiving a large number of e-mails, Santos received an e-mail from Chris Mora with a video of him drumming. Santos thought [...] "You can’t be for real, dude" [...] and asked Mora to come down for the first audition. 10 minutes into the audition Mora was hired as the drummer. Santos auditioned for an Australian band that moved to America called Cryogenic. Although he thought the band was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> he met the band's bassist Henno. As Cryogenic and Mudrock, who were working together, had both lost their vocalists, Henno contacted Santos and asked him to join the band, to which Santos accepted. Ryan Ready, who Santos had known since high-school, was recruited as the second guitarist. The band's original name was announced as Silent Civilians, which originates from the world's climate change by that people have opinions on life and politics and they do not voice their beliefs, living in a nation full of 'silent civilians'.|$|E
