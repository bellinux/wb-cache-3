5|$|The final dark {{match of}} the <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{qualifier}} for the King of the Ring tournament between Davey Boy Smith and Owen Hart (managed by Jim Cornette). The match {{went to a}} fifteen-minute time-limit draw. Unlike the other dark matches, this was taped for the June 5 episode of Raw.|$|E
5|$|Stoll brought Robey to cinema audiences {{a further}} four times during 1923. The first two films were written with the {{intention}} of showcasing the comedian's pantomime talents: One Arabian <b>Night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> reworking of Aladdin and co-starred Lionelle Howard and Edward O'Neill, while Harlequinade visited the roots of pantomime. One of Robey's more notable roles under Stoll was Sancho Panza in Maurice Elvey's 1923 film Don Quixote, for which he received a fee of £700 a week. The amount of time he spent working away from home led to the breakdown of his marriage, and he separated from Ethel in 1923. He had a brief affair with one of his leading ladies {{and walked out of the}} family home.|$|E
5|$|The Princess Theatre opened as a single-screen cinema on March 8, 1915 to rave reviews. It {{had cost}} McKernan CDN$75,000 {{and had taken}} 10 months to build, longer than expected. The theatre opened with 660 seats and the largest live {{performance}} stage in a cinema west of Winnipeg. It {{was at the time}} the only cinema on Edmonton’s south side, and would keep that title until the opening of the Garneau Theatre in 1940. Opening <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> benefit concert for The Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, associated with the 19th Alberta Dragoons, B Squad. The program proudly included newsreels “featuring actual war scenes”. In audience were the Lt. Governor and Mayor W.T. Henry. The house’s first feature film, The Eagle’s Mate starring Mary Pickford, was screened the following night.|$|E

5|$|The Germans quickly {{developed}} {{a series of}} basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar {{at this stage in}} the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the Fernnachtjagd in operations over Britain. Major Kuhlmann, head of the wireless telegraphy interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the North Sea, and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or Räume (areas). Raum A was Yorkshire, bounded by Hull, Leeds, Lancaster and Newcastle. Raum B covered the Midlands and Lincolnshire whilst Raum C encompassed East Anglia bounded by London Peterborough, Luton and The Wash. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.|$|E
25|$|In December 2014 {{the band}} played two nights at The Glasshouse in Pomona, CA. The first night was {{dedicated}} to playing through Gemini, Her Majesty in its entirety, followed by a six-song encore set with horn players.

25|$|At 2045 Scheer sent {{a message}} to Commodore Michelson on SMS Rostock to organise a torpedo boat attack against the British.

25|$|The French {{revolution}} {{opened the}} exhibition to foreign artists. In the 19th century {{the idea of}} a public Salon extended to an annual government-sponsored juried exhibition of new painting and sculpture, held in large commercial halls, to which the ticket-bearing public was invited. The vernissage (varnishing) of opening <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> grand social occasion, and a crush that gave subject matter to newspaper caricaturists like Honoré Daumier. Charles Baudelaire, Denis Diderot and others wrote reviews of the Salons.|$|E
25|$|The play {{opened at}} the Arts Theatre in Cambridge on 10 February 1951 {{although}} Christie was absent as she was in Iraq accompanying her husband Max Mallowan {{on one of his}} archaeological expeditions. She arranged for flowers to be sent to the female members of the cast. Hundreds of miles away, she was as nervous as ever at the public reaction although she was reassured by telegrams which told her that the opening <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> success. Even so, Saunders and director Hubert Gregg had to make some amendments to take out some of the unintentional comic moments that had occurred on the first night.|$|E
25|$|Late <b>Night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{production}} of Lorne Michaels' Broadway Video (and, since 2003, O'Brien's Conaco). It was taped in Studio 6A in the GE Building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City. Next {{to the door}} were framed pictures of Letterman, Carson, Jack Paar and Steve Allen, each of whose groundbreaking late-night shows originated from studio 6A or 6B (where The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon is currently taped). The studio holds just over 200 audience members. It was taped at about 5:30pm as an uninterrupted hour-long program, with the band playing music through the portions that would be filled by commercials. Generally, shows were taped at 5:30pm Monday through Friday, although {{for much of the}} show's run, reruns would be aired on Mondays and the show would not tape that day.|$|E

25|$|The final {{match of}} the <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> WWF Championship Triple-Threat match between Triple H, Kurt Angle, and the {{defending}} champion, The Rock. Before The Rock made his entrance, Angle and Triple H fought at ringside, with Triple H delivering a Pedigree on Angle on the commentator's announce table, which broke prematurely, resulting in Angle being Kayfabe injured. After the incident, The Rock made his entrance {{down to the}} ring. He wrestled Triple H as Angle was attended by EMTs, who transported Angle backstage. Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley then {{came down to the}} ring and attempted to interfere by hitting The Rock with the WWF Championship belt. She accidentally hit Triple H, however, which resulted in Triple H ordering McMahon to the backstage area. Angle returned to the ring midway through the match, alongside McMahon, and attacked Triple H. As Triple H recuperated, Angle called McMahon to give him a sledgehammer, but Angle and Triple H brawled over the sledgehammer, resulting in Triple H accidentally hitting McMahon. This situation allowed The Rock to throw Angle over the top rope onto ringside and deliver a People's Elbow on Triple H into a pinfall to win the match and retain the WWF Championship.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match of}} the <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Last Man Standing match between Edge and Chris Benoit. The match {{started out with}} Benoit getting the upper hand. Edge then got the upper hand by {{throwing}} Benoit sternum first into the turnbuckles. Benoit then applied the Sharpshooter on Edge. Benoit then performed multiple German suplexes on Edge, which sent Edge outside to the floor. Benoit dived through the ropes, but was met with a trash can lid to the face. Edge hit a superplex on Benoit through a trash can. Edge grabbed a ladder and dragged it into the ring, only to get a German suplex off of the ladder. Benoit missed a diving headbutt {{off the top of}} the ladder, Edge grabbed the Money in the Bank briefcase, but was caught in the Crippler Crossface. Edge got out of the Crippler Crossface and performed an Edgecution on Benoit on the briefcase. Benoit reached his feet at nine, only to get speared by Edge. After spearing Benoit again, Edge pulled a brick out of his briefcase and hit Benoit in the back of his head, leaving Benoit unable to answer the ten count.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match of}} the <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> clash between the Los Villanos brothers, Villano III, Villano IV, and Villano V and several wrestlers from the La Lagunero area of Mexico, {{the trio of}} Dr. Wagner Jr., Blue Panther, and Black Warrior who had {{developed}} a rivalry with the brothers {{over the last several}} months and who would have repeated clashes over the years following the 2000 Sin Piedad show. The fifth match of the night would see the team of Los Guerreros del Infierno ("The Infernal Warriors"; Rey Bucanero and Último Guerrero) defend their CMLL World Tag Team Championship against the team of El Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas. Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas were the previous holders of the championship, but were forced to vacate the title when Hijo del Santo stopped working for CMLL on a full time basis in mid-2000. Los Guerreros del Infierno had won a tournament for the vacant titles only a month earlier when the two defeated Mr. Niebla and Villano IV at CMLL's Entre Torre Infernal show. Hijo del Santo returned to CMLL during the tournament, immediately challenging the new champions for a title match since they never defeated the duo of Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas for the championship.|$|E

25|$|The semi-final {{match of}} the <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{continuation}} of the storyline between the two rudo factions (also called stables) Los Perros del Mal ("The Bad Dogs") and Los Guerreros del Infierno ("The Soldiers from the Inferno") that {{had been going on}} since the inception of Los Perros a couple of years prior. The Los Guerreros team of Atlantis, Tarzan Boy and Último Guerrero faced and defeated the Los Perros team of Perro Aguayo Jr., Héctor Garza and Shocker at the CMLL 73rd Anniversary Show to win the vacant CMLL World Trios Championship. Part of the reason Los Guerreros del Infierno won the tournament final was due to Shocker turning on Los Perros, causing Los Perros to demand a rematch for the championship. CMLL agreed and booked the champions to face Los Perros representatives Héctor Garza, Damián 666 and Halloween at the Sin Piedad event. The fourth match of the night would be the in-ring debut of the ring character Ephesto, who would team up with Averno and Mephisto to form a trio called La Triada del Terror ("The Triangle of Terror"). While Ephesto was a new character in CMLL the man under the mask had been with CMLL in the early 1990s under the ring name Pantera del Ring, and later on as Safari and Hombre Sin Nombre ("Man with no name") until CMLL decided to given him a new ring character and mask to team him up with Averno and Mephisto. Their opponents for the match were the then reigning CMLL World Tag Team Champion Místico, who along with co-champion Negro Casas had defended the title against Averno and Mephisto at least once before. Místico would be joined by Último Dragón and Volador Jr. for the match. Both wrestlers had worked extensively with Averno and Mephisto and both had aspirations for Averno's CMLL World Middleweight Championship.|$|E

500|$|Tickets {{were sold}} for 50cents apiece {{for adults and}} 25cents for children, and the first film shown on opening <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> western, Blood on the Moon.

Cacchio's wife, Fannie, sold tickets to moviegoers. She had never held such a job before the Theatre's opening, but continued to sell tickets and work at the Theatre for over five decades without requesting a single paycheck. The Theatre continued to house the town's fire department for some time; one Rosendale resident, Bill Brooks, later recalled walking around a fire truck to reach the bathroom.|$|E

500|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 4 March 1945, as the bombers {{crossed over the}} English coast, a Ju 88 night fighter opened fire on a No. 214 Squadron RAF B-17, {{returning}} from a Window patrol. The bomber was damaged but evaded its attacker, landing safely at RAF Oulton. The combat was the opening salvo of Gisela. The station commander at Oulton reported an intruder over his station and soon after radar screens picked up large numbers of hostile aircraft. The headquarters of 100 Group were alerted and a scramble order given to Mosquito squadrons. A [...] "scram" [...] order was also issued to bomber units still airborne; it signified a warning to number crews that intruders were in the vicinity and they were to divert to airfields in western or southern England, and out of danger. The second victim of the <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Mosquito of No. 169 Squadron RAF which was probably shot down while en route to its alternative landing site.|$|E
500|$|... "Trapped in the Sky" [...] {{received}} a positive, contemporary critical response from L.

[...] Writing for the same newspaper in 2011, Simon Heffer remembered his enthusiastic impressions of watching [...] "Trapped in the Sky" [...] as a boy in 1965, and how it endeared him {{to the rest of the}} series: [...] "... I had just watched the first episode of Thunderbirds. I felt as though the whole landscape of what passes for my imagination had been changed... It caused an excitement of the sort that is possible only for the very young, and it lasted for days. Indeed, every Saturday <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> renewal of the miracle." [...] Co-creator Sylvia Anderson observes that, by necessity, the pilot episode comprises many examples of exposition for the purposes of introducing the primary characters and vehicles. However, she considers the roles of Lady Penelope and Parker to be [...] "brief but effective".|$|E
500|$|The band's {{set list}} {{was similar to}} that of most shows on the PopMart Tour, but with [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] in place of The Edge's karaoke segment and the {{addition}} of [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] in the second encore. The <b>night</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> celebration {{of the end of the}} war, with Bono setting the tone by shouting out [...] "Viva Sarajevo! Fuck the past, kiss the future!" [...] at the beginning of [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing". Bono had struggled with his voice throughout the tour, and the morning of the concert he woke up [...] "without a voice". There was no intent to cancel, and the show went ahead as planned. Though Bono had few difficulties through the opening quartet of [...] "Mofo", [...] "I Will Follow", [...] "Gone", and [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing", his voice gave out during [...] "Last Night on Earth". In 2006, The Edge suggested that Bono's vocal troubles had been caused by laryngitis or by the stress of the previous few months of touring, though he later remarked that [...] "it didn't really matter that our lead singer was under the weather because every member of the audience seemed to join in on every song. There was a mass chorus for the whole concert." ...|$|E
