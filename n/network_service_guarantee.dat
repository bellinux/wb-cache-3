40|$|In a post Internet bubble {{economic}} environment the obvious {{lack of any}} disruptive new technologies that could give new impetus to network growth (as, for example, experienced after {{the appearance of the}} Web) lead to a trivialization of network services: Aside grass-roots, semi-subterranean applications like file sharing, entertainment content swapping and on-line gaming, {{it can be argued that}} <b>network</b> <b>services</b> are presently used in a manner not very different than a decade ago. In this respect, one of the factors that can be identified as limiting further development is the perceived lack of guarantees with regard to <b>network</b> <b>services.</b> The articles comprised in this thesis address the subject of <b>network</b> <b>service</b> <b>guarantees</b> from two main perspectives. In Part I we study <b>network</b> <b>service</b> <b>guarantees</b> from a reliability standpoint. In particular, we address the following issues: Study what network infrastructure characteristics (e. g. data transmission method properties) are prone to inducing vulnerabilities in the overlaying <b>network</b> <b>services.</b> Analyze the mechanisms and methods used at network protocol stack level for mitigating impairments like temporary traffic congestion or network element failures. Propose mechanisms for fast <b>network</b> <b>service</b> level restoration in the wake of network elements failures. In Part II of the thesis we address the topic of guarantees with respect to the <b>network</b> <b>service</b> performance level. In particular we study and propose mechanisms for guaranteeing deterministic upper bounds on worst-case queuing delays in general packet networks. Using network calculus concepts of traffic envelope and service curve we show how to deliver end-to-end queuing delay guarantees in connection-oriented networks carrying several traffic classes, with multiple packet sizes.

40|$|The {{requirements}} of real-time applications {{mean that they}} often stand to benefit from <b>network</b> <b>service</b> <b>guarantees,</b> and in particular delay guarantees.

Active Drop Queue (ADQ) demonstrates the feasibility of providing more flexible support to the real-time applications. It supports both the conformed and the excess real-time traffic by (1) guaranteeing a delay bound to a contracted amount of real-time traffic; (2) transmitting with the same delay bound as many excess real-time packets as possible; and (3) enforcing a given link sharing ratio between excess real-time traffic and other service classes, e. g., best-effort traffic.

An novel end-to-end rate control scheme of guaranteeing minimal rate for each control loop of NCS is proposed. This scheme can guarantee to meet the requirements of quality of <b>network</b> <b>service</b> of NCS and show TCP friendly. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective. Indouction The networked control system（NCS）is a kind of control system over networks which has hard real-time requirements. There exist interaction between quality of control performance(QoP) and quality of network service(QoS) [1]. To guarantee QoP, a certain upper bound of QoS should not be exceeded[2]. UDP protocol generally is employed in NCS to guarantee hard real-time requirement. But, UDP may induce network congestion collapse which will degrade QoS, and degradation of QoS will directly make QoP of control system deteriorating and even unstable. To avoid network congestion collapse and guarantee QoP of control system, UDP data flow in NCS should possess the property of TCP Friendly and meet the QoS limit[4 - 5].

The problem involves identifying, for all hop counts, the optimal, i. e., minimum weight, path(s) between a given source and destination(s). The AHOP problem arises naturally {{in the context of}} quality-of-service (QoS) routing in networks, where routes (paths) need to be computed that provide <b>services</b> <b>guarantees,</b> e. g., delay or bandwidth, at the minimum possible “cost” (amount of resources required) to the <b>network.</b> Because <b>service</b> <b>guarantees</b> are typically provided through some form of resource allocation on the path (links) computed for a new request, the hop count, which captures the number of links over which resources are allocated, is a commonly used cost measure. As a result, a standard approach for determining the cheapest path available that meets a desired level of <b>service</b> <b>guarantees</b> is to compute a minimum hop shortest (optimal) path. Furthermore, for efficiency purposes, it is desirable to precompute such optimal minimum hop paths for all possible service requests. Providing this information gives rise to solving the AHOP problem. The paper’s contributions are to investigate the computational complexity of solving the AHOP problem for two of the most prevalent cost functions (path weights) in networks, namely, additive and bottleneck weights. In particular, we establish that a solution based on the Bellman–Ford algorithm is optimal for additive weights, but show that this does not hold for bottleneck weights for which a lower complexity solution exists...|$|R

40|$|<b>Network</b> <b>services</b> with {{deterministic}} <b>guarantees</b> {{are based}} on a worst-case description of user-generated traffic. When designing a policing and scheduling algorithm for <b>guaranteed</b> <b>services</b> on the Internet, accuracy of description of the traffic profile has to be traded with simplicity of implementation. The result of this trade off is often expressed as the number of token buckets required by the service along with the choice of their parameters. The GS type of service proposed by the IETF uses two token buckets both for characterizing the traffic and for policing it. The choice of using only two token buckets is primarily driven by policing costs. In this paper we propose a method that allows the number of token buckets used for characterizing the traffic to be greater than what is actually needed to police it. This means we can obtain an accurate profile of the traffic while keeping policing simple. The method consists of computing a profile of the traffic which involves a number of token buckets of the order of ten, and then doing the policing using only the first token bucket, plus another one which is chosen depending on the delay requirements of the receivers.
