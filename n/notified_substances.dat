40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an inventory made in 2002 by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) on the revisions of the EC Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) in support of risk assessment for newly <b>notified</b> <b>substances,</b> existing substances and biocides. The TGDs (first published in 1996) were subject to an update procedure, taking into account the experience gained in the assessment of numerous new and existing substances and the additional needs of the risk assessment of biocides. The Competent Authorities (CAs) of the EU member states came to an agreement on the revised TGDs. The 'final draft' documents, available on August 1, 2002, on the protected European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) website were used for the current inventory. These documents remained unchanged until the finalisation of the current report in November 2002. RIVM risk assessments and risk assessment procedures, along with the software tool, EUSES (European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances), will be adapted {{on the basis of this}} report...|$|E

During 2010, 41 new psychoactive substances were officially notified {{for the first time in}} the European Union through the information exchange mechanism, the Early-Warning System (EWS), which was set up by the Decision. The number of new compounds reported in 2010 was higher than ever; the list of newly <b>notified</b> <b>substances</b> was rather diverse and included a plant-based substance, synthetic derivatives of well-established drugs, as well as substances that can be described as ‘designer medicines’. Under the so called ‘Spice’ phenomenon, 11 new synthetic cannabinoids were reported, bringing the total number of synthetic cannabinoids monitored by the EWS to 21.

European Commission, Luxembourg, Part 1, 2 and 3, 760 pp. ]. To achieve this goal, an environmental risk assessment was performed according to the TGD for two major contaminants, atrazine and diuron, that are present in the Seine River estuary (France) and listed in the EU Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000 / 60 /CE). Results showed that atrazine presented a source of risk in the upper- and mid-estuary throughout the 1993 and 1996 spring seasons. Diuron introduced a risk into the same areas throughout spring periods of 1993 - 2005. Results are discussed and some suggestions for a more realistic in situ risk assessment are given. For the computation of a more relevant PNEC for pesticides, their specific mode of action should be taken into consideration as well as ecotoxicological data on species endemic to the considered area...|$|E

40|$|Environmental risk {{assessment}} {{is a key}} feature of regulations controlling the placing of new, {{and the maintenance of}} existing, chemicals products in the market place. For example, European Commission Directive 93 / 67 /EC on Risk Assessment for New <b>Notified</b> <b>Substances</b> and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1488 / 94 on Risk Assessment for Existing Substances requires that {{risk assessment}}s be carried out for new and existing substances in the European Community. The process of environmental risk assessment seeks to determine the balance of probability of species and communities being damaged by chemical releases. The process relies upon a valid estimation of a predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in relevant environmental compartments and a predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) below which the organisms present in that compartment are unlikely to be significantly affected. If the PEC exceeds the PNEC there is a potential for damaging effects to occur. This article focuses on the determination of PNECs for risk assessment. Methods for determining a PNEC described in OECD Monograph 26 (1989, Report of the OECD Workshop on Ecological Effect Assessment, Paris, France, have been applied to data derived for the four chemicals lindane, 3, 4 -dichloroaniline, atrazine, and copper in a series of collaborative research projects funded by the European Commission...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} a decision tree for {{the risk evaluation}} of the so-called "difficult" substances with the Uniform System for the Evaluation of Substances (USES). The decision tree gives practical guidelines for the regulatory authorities to evaluate <b>notified</b> <b>substances</b> like organometallic compounds, cationic compounds, anionic compounds, surfactants, inorganic compounds, acids, bases and compounds without an available octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow). The decision tree gives reasonable worst case estimates for the Risk Characterisation Ratios of substances of which no Kow value can be estimated or measured. The decision tree only asks for more {{a detailed analysis of}} both sorption and bioaccumulation, when the predicted environmental concentrations are sufficiently high to make a difference for the outcome of the risk assessment. The report suggests to use the Kow value of the neutral molecule of acids and bases even when these molecules are present as anions or cations at pH 7. The guidelines and suggestions in this report were based on the evaluation of a large data set with the Kow, soil sorption coefficient (Koc) and bioconcentration factor (BCF) of pesticides. It is argued that these guidelines and suggestions are valid {{for a wide range of}} "difficult" substances. The uncertainties encountered with the estimation of Koc and BCF from Kow for different classes of "difficult" substances were estimated and their influence on the outcome of the risk evaluation with USES 2. 0 or EUSES was analysed...|$|E

In Brazil, Carthamus tinctorius L., Asteraceae, seeds essential oil, the safflower oil, is currently used as a thermogenic compound and as treatment for problems related to the cardiovascular system. In this study, by Raman spectroscopy, it was shown that oleic and linoleic acids are the compounds present in higher concentrations in the safflower oil. We demonstrated that safflower oil (750 mg/kg, p. o.) decrease the ulcerogenic lesions in mice after the administration of hydrochloric acid-ethanol. The gastric ulcers induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in mice treated with cholinomimetics were treated with four different doses of safflower oil, of which, the dose of 187. 5 mg/kg (p. o.) showed significant antiulcerogenic properties (**p < 0. 01). Moreover, the safflower oil at doses of 187. 5 mg/kg (i. d.) increased the pH levels, gastric volume (**p < 0. 01) and gastric mucus production (***p < 0. 001), and decreased the total gastric acid secretion (***p < 0. 001). The acute toxicity tests showed that safflower oil (5. 000 mg/kg, p. o.) had no effect on mortality or any other physiological parameter. Ecotoxicological tests performed using Daphnia similis showed an EC 50 at 223. 17 mg/l, and therefore safflower oil can be considered &# 8220;non-toxic&# 8221; based on the directive 93 / 67 /EEC on risk assessment for new <b>notified</b> <b>substances</b> by European legislation.

40|$|Regulatory {{classification}} of substances in the European Union (EU) {{is intended to}} identify their hazardous toxicological properties in a formal and harmonized manner. In the regulatory work, a specific chemical with its molecular structure is classified as a skin sensitizer. This implies that the compound is stable throughout its lifetime. The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to discuss the problem of skin sensitizing oxidation/degradation products formed by air exposure of various materials or substances with very low allergenic activity. In regulatory classification work on skin sensitizers, the intrinsic suspectibility of a chemical to air oxidation (autoxidation) should be taken into consideration. We give examples of natural terpenoid materials, but the concept of allergens formed by air oxidation can apply to other materials widely used in industrial products. If a positive classification is made for a substance with a known chemical structure, a note should indicate that the primary chemical structure of the <b>notified</b> <b>substance</b> is not a skin sensitizer, but that (some of) its oxidation products are.

40|$|Introduction. This paper {{discusses}} the most topical {{issues of the}} Biocidal Products Directive (BPD) implementation, in particular, {{the impact on the}} social and health safety on various population groups, environmental safety, trade, manufacturing and their prospectives. The Aim of the Study – to evaluate the development of the biocides market and its participants in Lithuania. The Tasks – to evaluate the impact of the approximation of the laws of Lithuania and the European Union, concerning the placing of biocides on the market and its participants. Methods. Based on the "Methodology for impact of the regulatory laws assessment", the study identifies changes in the biocides market and the activity of its participants. A sample survey of manufacturers of biocides and of the users (personal health care institutions and preventive disinfection and disinfestation enterprises) was conducted. The analysis and evaluation of the available biocides database was also undertaken and SPSS statistics software was used to measure the statistical significance of the results. The market was assessed by the application of the criteria laid down in the BPD, in particular, the number of authorized biocides, distribution of product types, distribution of biocides according to categories of users, distribution of use of identified and <b>notified</b> active <b>substances</b> of biocides. Results. The study demonstrated that the Lithuanian biocides market has changed following the implementation of the BPD: in particular, number of authorized biocides has increased as well as diversity of product types, use of <b>notified</b> active <b>substances</b> in biocides has increased as well as number of biocides intended for professional users. The comparative analysis of the data gathered from participants of the Lithuanian market points to improvements, in particular, the increased access to information by manufacturers in relation to active substances in biocides; in Lithuania manufactured biocides quality confirms the requirements of the BPD; variety of biocides used by preventive disinfection and disinfestation enterprises has expanded; the reduced average number of medical professionals directly contacting with biocides and the trend towards the reduced use of biocides concentrates. Conclusions. The approximation of the laws of Lithuania and the European Union concerning the placing of biocides on the market has had a positive impact on changes in biocides market and on its participants, ensuring public health and environmental safety quality...|$|R

Hazards relating to concentration, composition, individual contaminants and supplement interactions present an increasing public health concern. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the literature for reported supplement contaminations (occurs in ca 25 % of supplements, with anabolic steroids being the most common) and complement these findings with notifications logged in the EU’s Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) through imports or market surveillance, typically logged for poor quality control issues. Notifications in the RASFF have steadily increased by sixfold for supplements in the past 7 years with the USA and China being the major transgressors. Finland and Italy lead in detections, mainly <b>notifying</b> unpermitted <b>substances</b> and contaminants in sexual-enhancing or weight-loss supplements. This paper highlights the paucity of enforcement. Regulating supplements as a foodstuff and not a medicine, coupled with the fact that a significant proportion of the supplement market is distributed via the Internet (hence absent from routine border control and surveillance), make ensuring and enforcing safety a very challenging task. The need for better quality control, compliance and public awareness is evident...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{applicability}} of a fish acute threshold (step-down) test approach {{for the assessment of}} new chemical <b>substances</b> <b>notified</b> in the EU. The proposed approach basically implies replacing the fish LC 50 toxicity test with a simple acute threshold test and thus reducing the number of fish used and also costs. The fish test would be performed only at one concentration, the lowest between the EC 50 concentrations obtained with previous testing with algae and daphnia. When fish would be more sensitive than algae and daphnia, testing with fish would be continued at lower concentrations (step-down). From step-down test results the LC 50 value can be obtained by applying the binominal method of interpolation. These data can be used together with algal and daphnid data to provide the same Predicted No Effect Concentration values. The acute aquatic toxicity data used in this evaluation were extracted from the New Chemicals Database of the European Chemicals Bureau. The results show that 53. 6 – 71. 2 % reduction of the number of fish used would be possible when applying this new testing strategy and suggest its use for regulatory purposes. JRC.

40|$|Repeated dose {{toxicity}} is a {{very complex}} toxicological endpoint and several {{attempts have been made to}} get an acceptable prediction of this endpoint to fill data gaps in the REACH dossiers without using too many animal studies. In the present project, we do apply Multi-Label-Classification (MLC) to simultaneously predict multiple toxic effects of chemical compounds. The final, validated MLC models are well documented and published as freely accessible prediction web service. The predicted target values are based on toxicity endpoints from over 2000 repeated dose toxicity studies in rats with sub-acute or sub-chronic duration and oral or inhalation application. The data basis was joined from publicly available repeated dose toxicity data of industrial chemicals (RepDose data base), and confidential toxicity data of the European List of <b>Notified</b> Chemical <b>Substances</b> (ELINCS) data base. Although this data set with 1022 compounds and 28 endpoints is very comprehensive and detailed from a toxicological point of view it is extremely sparse for statistical analysis: 82 % of the experimentally derived endpoint values are missing as the endpoint was either not considered in the particular study, or there was no measurable effect in all investigated dose groups. We have discretized the numeric endpoint values to the binary class values 'active' and 'inactive'. Thus, the LOEL values have been clustered, while taking the study duration into account. We calculated physico-chemical descriptors and structural fragments as input features for the prediction models. The structural fragments have been computed by matching the dataset compounds with established, pre-defined lists of SMARTS (SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification) patterns. We evaluated various MLC algorithms with a 10 -times repeated 10 -fold cross-validation. The selected MLC technique 'Ensemble of Classifier Chains' (ECC) exploits correlations between endpoints by repeatedly building chains of multiple classifiers in randomized orders. The overall predictive performance of this method is 68 % Area-under-ROC (AUC) (63 % sensitivity, 61 % selectivity). We compared the ECC approach with 'Predictive Clustering Trees' (PCT) which is an alternative MLC method; PCT which is slightly less predictive, but is applied within this project to create categories.

40|$|Abstract Introduction. Among novel psychoactive <b>substances</b> <b>notified</b> to EMCDDA and Europol were 1 ‐cyclohexyl‐x‐methoxybenzene {{stereoisomers}} (ortho, meta, and para). These substances {{share some}} structural characteristics with phencyclidine and tramadol. Nowadays, no {{information on the}} pharmacological and toxicological effects evoked by 1 ‐cyclohexyl‐x‐methoxybenzene are reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect evoked by each one stereoisomer on visual stimulation, body temperature, acute thermal pain, and motor activity in mice. Methods. Mice were evaluated in behavioral tests carried out in a consecutive manner according to the following time scheme: observation of visual placing response, measures of core body temperature, determination of acute thermal pain, and stimulated motor activity. Results. All three stereoisomers dose‐dependent inhibit visual placing response (rank order: meta > ortho > para), induce hyperthermia at lower and hypothermia at higher doses (meta > ortho > para) and cause analgesia to thermal stimuli (para > meta = ortho), while they do not alter motor activity. Conclusions. For the first time, this study demonstrates that systemic administration of 1 ‐cyclohexyl‐x‐methoxybenzene compounds markedly inhibit visual response, promote analgesia, and induce core temperature alterations in mice. This data, although obtained in animal model, suggest their possible hazard for human health (i. e., hyperthermia and sensorimotor alterations). In particular, these novel psychoactive substances may have a negative impact in many daily activities, greatly increasing the risk factors for workplace accidents and traffic injuries...|$|R
40|$|Objectives In this study, the {{possibility}} of using existing test data provided in Korea and elsewhere for the registration of chemical substances was examined. Data on 510 chemical substances that are among the first subject to registration under the “Act on the Registration and Evaluation, etc. of Chemical Substances (K-REACH) ” were analyzed. Methods The possibility of using existing data from 16 reference databases was examined for 510 chemical <b>substances</b> <b>notified</b> in July 2015 as being subject to registration. Results Test data with the reliability required for the registration of chemical substances under the K-REACH constituted 48. 4 % of the required physicochemical characteristics, 6. 5 % of the required health hazards, and 9. 4 % of the required environmental hazards. Conclusions Some existing test data were not within the scope of this research, including data used for registration in the European Union (EU). Thus, considering that 350 of these 510 species are registered in EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation & Restriction of Chemicals, more test data may exist that can be utilized in addition to the data identified in this study. Furthermore, the K-REACH states that non-testing data (test results predicted through Read Across, Quantitative Structure- Activity Relationships) and the weight of evidence (test results predicted based on test data with low reliability) can also be utilized for registration data. Therefore, if methods for using such data were actively reviewed, {{it would be possible to}} reduce the cost of securing test data required for the registration of chemical substances...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{commissioned}} by the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) to review the pesticide approval system in the UK and Europe {{as far as it}} affects the use of substances and techniques for crop protection by organic producers in Wales. WAG considers it important that the UK pesticide approval system does not present unnecessary barriers to the development of organic production in Wales. Key Recommendations and scope for further work · WAG should work with the Pesticides Safety Directorate to ensure that the development of pesticide regulatory policy at both National and European level takes full account of the needs of both conventional and organic agriculture and horticulture in the UK. · There is scope for WAG to support the development of a National Pesticide Policy so that regulatory and commercial barriers impeding the development of organic pesticides are minimised. Not only could greater availability of ‘organic pesticides’ {{have a significant impact on}} organic production in Wales but there could be important implications for conventional horticulture systems and the use of alternatives to conventional pesticides. · One important regulatory barrier to the registration of ‘organic pesticides’ is the MRL requirement(s) for their approval and this needs to be resolved. Suitable analytical techniques are required to determine firstly whether these substances result in residues, and secondly to identify the breakdown and residue pathways. So far, this issue has not received the attention of any EU Member State. · According to the proposed framework for the 4 th Stage Review of EU Pesticides Directive 91 / 414, notifiers are required to produce a dossier, at their own expense, covering characterisation, human toxicity, ecotoxicity efficacy and other relevant data. The Review includes specific provision for companies <b>notifying</b> the same <b>substance</b> to submit a shared dossier. This will help those businesses (many of which are relatively small companies) to save on the high cost of producing the dossiers. It will also aid the Commission since it will reduce the number of dossiers that have to be considered, and ensure that all the available data is included. WAG should encourage and support the production of collective dossiers; although as yet there is no indication of how this will be done in practice, and further details from the Commission are awaited. · This study has concluded that access to a wider range of ‘organically acceptable pesticides’ would not have a dramatic impact on organic production in Wales. However, in developing an integrated organic policy, WAG should continue to address the pesticides issue. Some of the methods of pest & disease control in organic systems are either physical or multi-cellular e. g. micro-organisms used as biocontrol agents. WAG agri environment policy may provide a vehicle to promote these techniques much more actively. Further, it is important to recognise that while Wales alone is too small to have a major impact on commercial and regulatory pressures, WAG can have an impact by working pro-actively with others to make progress. · There are no published EU or national Member State criteria that can be used to evaluate the acceptability of pesticide substances for organic production. Identifying such criteria and promoting their acceptance at EU level and nationally would allow more active substances to be made available. WAG should work with PSD and others to identify appropriate criteria. · The specific provisions of Article 7 in Annex 2 (b) of the Organic Regulation (2092 / 91) place potential barriers to the adoption of organically acceptable substances for crop protection. There are a number of potentially useful substances currently not included in the Organic Regulation e. g. potassium bicarbonate. WAG should work with PSD and others to identify such substances and support the production of appropriate dossiers. WAG could also encourage further dialogue between the organic sector and Defra to identify amendments in the Organic Regulations to facilitate the inclusion of new pesticides. · Organic pest and disease management is not just a question of inputs but it also relies crucially on advice and extension through initiatives such as Farming Connect and the work of Organic Centre Wales. Long-term commitment to supporting on going advice and extension activities is vital to promote and disseminate best practice in Welsh agriculture and horticulture. · Organic horticulture, vegetable and fruit production systems are particularly sensitive to pest and disease management. Successful control of pests, diseases (and weeds) in these sectors can be critical to the business, and is not assured even when all husbandry and management methods have been effectively applied. Consequently, the use of organically acceptable crop protection methods resulting from future developments (e. g. biopesticides, biological control agents) could have an important role in pest and disease management in these sectors. Both organic and conventional producers in Wales could benefit from having these options available to them and WAG could encourage the adoption of these approaches through appropriate Technology Transfer activities. · The way in which such substances will be regulated at a European level in future is evolving as the review of the Pesticide Directive 91 / 414 EEC enters the 4 th Stage. This stage of the review includes (amongst others) those substances permitted for use in organic production. The guidance documents for the evaluation of applications on plant protection products made from plants or plant extracts and from chemical substances are currently at the draft stage. The response of the Pesticide Safety Directorate and Defra to these developments is not yet clear but this provides an excellent opportunity for WAG to have an input at an early stage in the review process...|$|R
