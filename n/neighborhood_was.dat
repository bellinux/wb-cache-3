5|$|Even as the {{building}} was under construction, the ethnic makeup of the church's <b>neighborhood</b> <b>was</b> rapidly changing; native-born Baptists were displaced by Irish and German immigrants. As members moved uptown, the congregation decided to follow and sold their building in 1860 to Alanson T. Biggs, a successful local merchant. The departing Baptist congregation founded the Fifth Avenue Baptist church, then founded the Park Avenue Church, and finally built the Riverside Church.|$|E

5|$|The {{locations}} of the station entrances are all south of 96th Street. In 2009, there was a debate over {{the placement of the}} location of the street entrances. Because 96th Street divides the neighborhoods of the Upper East Side to the south and East Harlem to the north, some residents of East Harlem stated that their <b>neighborhood</b> <b>was</b> not served by the Second Avenue Subway.|$|E

5|$|The {{overwhelming}} sensation {{about the}} <b>neighborhood</b> <b>was</b> {{the smell of}} the community caused not just by the packing plants located immediately to the east, but also by the 345-acre Chicago Union Stock Yards containing 2,300 pens of livestock, located further east from the packing plants.|$|E
5|$|At 6:49 pm fire crews {{waiting to}} connect to Phoenix {{reported}} she was having difficulty getting close enough because of low tide conditions. Despite the problems requiring pilot and commander Arvid Havneras to perform an extraordinarily hazardous docking procedure, at 7:00 pm Phoenix was ready to pump at the Marina lagoon, two blocks away from the first fire. By this time the whole <b>neighborhood</b> <b>was</b> threatened with destruction by fire. Fire crews were manning hoses laid in anticipation; firefighters at the burning buildings were instructed to hold their ground, that they would soon have more water.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had gone as far as Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole <b>neighborhood</b> <b>was</b> set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|On August 20, 1904, severe {{thunderstorms}} and tornadoes damaged {{hundreds of}} downtown buildings, causing USD $1.78 million ($ million present-day) in damages {{to the city}} and ripping spans from the High Bridge. In the 1960s, during urban renewal, Saint Paul razed western neighborhoods close to downtown. The city also contended with the creation of the interstate freeway system in a fully built landscape. From 1959 to 1961, the western Rondo <b>neighborhood</b> <b>was</b> demolished by the construction of Interstate 94, which brought attention to racial segregation and unequal housing in northern cities. The annual Rondo Days celebration commemorates the African American community.|$|E

Schiel was one of two CPS schools recognized as a Blue Ribbon School in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} set up {{a second}} committee in 1968 who suggested that the old eastwest runway be closed and the airport's area reduced, allowing for development {{to the east of}} the airport. They suggested that this is replaced by a new runway in the sea, adjacent to the beach. The runway was closed, and a high density upper-middle income <b>neighborhood</b> <b>was</b> built to the east of the airport, although the new runway was never constructed due to the high cost involved.|$|E

5|$|Construction of I-496 {{started in}} 1963, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970. Segments of the freeway south of {{downtown}} Lansing {{were built in}} the location of a historically black neighborhood. This <b>neighborhood</b> <b>was</b> formed based on the segregationist practices of the early 20th century. Community leaders worked for different housing opportunities for the black residents displaced by I-496 rather than fight the freeway. As the trunkline neared completion, competing proposals to name it resulted in two similar, but separate designations applied to I-496. The city originally approved one name in honor of a former mayor. The local historical society proposed that the state name it as a memorial to Olds after the demolition of the Olds Mansion. The city renamed it the Oldsmobile Expressway, the name under which it opened in December 1970. Two years later, the Michigan Legislature restored its preferred name and it has been the Olds Freeway since.|$|E
5|$|Seattle's {{foreign-born}} {{population grew}} 40% between the 1990 and 2000 censuses. The Chinese {{population in the}} Seattle area has origins in mainland China, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. The earliest Chinese-Americans that came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were almost entirely from Guangdong Province.

5|$|Two {{months after}} the Anacostia Station opened, WMATA said that a study of bus and rail {{ridership}} showed that the unaltered bus routes were costing the transit agency $200,000 a month in lost rail fares. To make up the lost revenue, WMATA {{said that it would}} run only two-car trains (the shortest on the system) on the Green Line during slow periods weekdays and evenings and on Sundays beginning in June 1992. In November 1992, WMATA reported that ridership at the Anacostia Station was (on average) 7,500 riders a day, 700 below estimates. WMATA admitted that although riders had made the switch from bus to rail, the lower ridership numbers were due to the recession and not because of continuing downtown bus service in the area. Metro said ridership on buses in the <b>neighborhood</b> <b>was</b> down significantly, and the transit agency reduced the number of buses on some routes to avoid having empty buses.|$|E

5|$|The Dakota people, the {{original}} {{inhabitants of the}} area where Minneapolis now stands, believed in the Great Spirit and were surprised that not all European settlers were religious. Over fifty denominations and religions and some well known churches have since been established in Minneapolis. Those who arrived from New England were {{for the most part}} Christian Protestants, Quakers, and Universalists. The oldest continuously used church in the city, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in the Nicollet Island/East Bank <b>neighborhood,</b> <b>was</b> built in 1856 by Universalists and soon afterward was acquired by a French Catholic congregation. The first Jewish congregation in Minneapolis was formed in 1878 as Shaarai Tov (though it has been known since 1920 as Temple Israel); in 1928, it built the synagogue in East Isles. St. Mary's Orthodox Cathedral was founded in 1887, opened a missionary school in 1897 and in 1905 created the first Russian Orthodox seminary in the U.S. Edwin Hawley Hewitt designed both St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral and Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church on Hennepin Avenue just south of downtown. The first basilica in the United States, and co-cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, the Basilica of Saint Mary near Loring Park was named by Pope Pius XI in 1926.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook for the sound of a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who did come to realize the danger approaching began to alert those around them, and panic ensued in the streets as people scrambled to take shelter. Despite the best efforts of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not fully aware of the oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of the city. This <b>neighborhood</b> <b>was</b> where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having first come to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, however, {{even as the}} {{gentrification}} of the <b>neighborhood</b> <b>was</b> rapidly proceeding, crime was soaring, along with crime {{in the rest of}} New York City.
