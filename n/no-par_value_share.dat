He was, for instance, responsible for drafting the 1994 law on “kleine Aktiengesellschaften” (closed limited companies on shares), the law concerning the Corporate Sector Supervision and Transparency Act (Gesetz zur Kontrolle und Transparenz im Unternehmensbereich - KonTraG, 1998), which was the first important corporate governance reform in Germany, the law on <b>no-par</b> <b>value</b> <b>shares</b> (Stückaktiengesetz - StückAG, 1998), the law on registered shares and the facilitating of the exercise of voting rights (Gesetz zur Namensaktie und zur Erleichterung der Stimmrechtsausübung - NaStraG, 2001), and the Act on Corporate Integrity and Modernization of the Law to Challenge Decisions by the Shareholders' Meeting (Gesetz zur Unternehmensintegrität und Modernisierung des Anfechtungsrechts - UMAG, 2004). During the 16th legislative period in Germany, Seibert prepared numerous legislative proposals, such as the Act on Electronic Commercial Registers, Registers of Cooperatives and Business Registers (Gesetz über das Elektronische Handels- und Genossenschaftsregister sowie das Unternehmensregister - EHUG) and the Act to Modernize the Law Governing Private Limited Companies and to Combat Abuses (Gesetz zur Modernisierung des GmbH-Rechts und zur Bekämpfung von Missbräuchen - MoMiG, 2008) - which constituted the first major GmbH reform since the creation of this law in the late 19th century. In addition, he also drafted the politically controversial amendment of the Volkswagen Law, the Act Implementing the Shareholder Rights Directive (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Aktionärsrechterichtlinie - ARUG), and the Act on Appropriate Executive Board Renumeration (Gesetz zur Angemessenheit der Vorstandsvergütung - VorstAG). During the financial crisis of 2007-2008, he was charged with the corporation law aspects of the stabilization measures, including the Financial Market Stabilization Act (Finanzmarktstabilisierungsgesetz - FMStG, 2008). Following this, he worked on the legal regulation of professional partnerships with limited liability (Partnerschaftsgesellschaft mit beschränkter Berufshaftung - PartGmbB ...|$|R

40|$|The problem {{associated}} with <b>value</b> <b>shares</b> {{is that they}} may remain undervalued {{for an extended period}} of time. Therefore, determining when to buy <b>value</b> <b>shares</b> has been the focus of many investors and academics. Studies have determined fundamentals provide valuable information when selecting shares while price momentum provides a decent timing indicator. This research examines a novel share selection approach which seeks to combine fundamentals with momentum to obtain a leading timing indicator. This research seeks to determine if the fundamental momentum indicator can successfully and consistently separate value winners from value losers. The value portfolios were formed using a composite valuation measure made of three separate indicators. The Value portfolio was then ranked based on the strength of the fundamental momentum indicator. This research identified that Leverage Factor and Current Ratio momentum was able to separate value winners from losers in a consistent manner. However, only Current Ratio momentum was capable of creating portfolios which could consistently outperform the market. Therefore, this research identified that fundamental momentum could be used as a timing indicator when acquiring <b>value</b> <b>shares.</b> Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.
