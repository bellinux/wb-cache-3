During the Meiji Restoration, {{there had been}} a surge in the creation of monopolies. This was in part due to state intervention, as the monopolies served to allow Japan to become a world economic power. The state itself owned some of the monopolies, and others were owned by the zaibatsu. The monopolies managed the central core of the economy, with other aspects being controlled by the government ministry appropriate to the activity, including the <b>National</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Bank</b> and the Imperial family. This economic arrangement was in many ways similar to the later corporatist models of European fascists.|$|E
