25|$|Vitamin E was co-discovered by UA Agricultural Chemistry Professor Barnett Sure (1920–51). Sure, {{along with}} fellow {{professor}} Marinus C. Kik (1927–67) made major advances in <b>nutrition</b> <b>science</b> during their long tenures at the University of Arkansas. Sure co-discovered vitamin E, and extended {{knowledge of how}} vitamin E, amino acids and B-vitamins function on reproduction and lactation. Kik developed the process for parboiling rice (a major agricultural crop in the state) to increase retention of vitamins and shorten cooking time. He documented benefits of adding fish and chicken to rice and grain diets to provide adequate protein for a growing world population. Sure and Kik were Agricultural Experiment Station scientists and professors in the UA Department of Agricultural Chemistry, which merged in 1964 with Home Economics, now the School of Human Environmental Sciences.|$|E
