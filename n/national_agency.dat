40|$|There {{is little}} doubt that the process of European {{integration}} has resulted in a complex system of multilevel governance. Much has been said about the promises and pitfalls of an ever-increasing delegation of powers to the European Union (EU). However, scholars have only recently started to grasp the transformative effects of the integration process on national administrations, which is particularly visible with regard to semi-autonomous <b>national</b> <b>agencies.</b> The multilevel governance architecture of the EU increasingly relies on the administrative capacities of <b>national</b> <b>agencies</b> - which profoundly affects the allocation of attention and resources within <b>national</b> <b>agencies,</b> the institutional architecture of national administrative systems through both direct and indirect pressure to create agencies, and most importantly, the autonomy of <b>national</b> <b>agencies</b> within their domestic politico-administrations. Taken together, we argue that involvement by <b>national</b> <b>agencies</b> in European administrative networks has a transformative effect on national politico-administrative systems...|$|R
