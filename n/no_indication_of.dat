5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most multicellular animals. In sponges {{there is}} only a single report of the presence of dopamine, with <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> its function; however, dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E
5|$|Mainland law {{enforcement}} agencies must notify their Hong Kong counterparts within 14 days under a reciprocal mechanism if any Hong Kong resident is detained across the border, but Hong Kong officials had received no word through these channels at the expiration of the deadline. On 8 January Chinese security officials acknowledged that Lee Bo was being held in China. This {{took the form of}} a nine-word message sent to the Hong Kong Police Force with <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> his whereabouts or his activity status.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April 1915, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) {{landed on}} the western side of the Gallipoli Peninsula, at what {{thereafter}} became known as Anzac Cove. The first Turkish attempts to recapture the ANZAC beachhead were two unsuccessful attacks in April. Just over two weeks later, the Turks had gathered a force of 42,000 men (four divisions) to conduct their second assault against the ANZAC's 17,300 men (two divisions). The ANZAC commanders had <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the impending attack until the day before, when British aircraft reported a build-up of troops opposite the ANZAC positions.|$|E

Parsons said that Project Alberta would have it ready by August 11, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if the bomb could be readied by August 9. Parsons agreed to try to do so.|$|E
5|$|Since Warhol gave <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> a {{definitive}} ordering of the collection, the sequence chosen by MoMA (in the picture {{at the upper}} right of this article) in the display from their permanent collection reflects the chronological order in which the varieties were introduced by the Campbell Soup Company, beginning with Tomato in the upper left, which debuted in 1897. By April 2011, the curators at the MoMA had reordered the varieties, moving Clam Chowder to the upper left and tomato {{to the bottom of}} the four rows.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. Although {{there was}} <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy {{gave them the}} name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but {{in the absence of}} skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{produced}} art {{to serve}} functional purposes. For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were {{developed during the}} Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change. These artistic standards—simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> spatial depth—created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The Narmer Palette, for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs. Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of May 19, PC-815's sonar {{detected}} what the crew believed to be an enemy submarine off Cape Lookout, about ten to twelve miles offshore. Over the next two and a half days, Hubbard ordered his crew to fire a total of 35 depth charges and a number of gun rounds to target what Hubbard believed to be two Imperial Japanese Navy submarines. The PC-815 was joined by the US Navy blimps K-39 and K-33, the US Coast Guard patrol boats Bonham and 78302 and the subchasers USS SC-536 and USS SC-537 to assist it in the search for the suspected enemy vessels. Hubbard was given temporary command of the vessels on the afternoon of May 19. The larger subchaser PC-778 also joined the submarine search, though it found <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> submarines and its commander was subsequently castigated by Hubbard for his refusal to lay its own larger stock of depth charges or resupply the PC-815.|$|E

5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> {{feathering}} on {{the upper}} neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E
5|$|William H. Jackson did, in fact, own the {{property}} {{on the opposite}} side of Dearing Street from the tree. That plot included the present-day 226 Dearing Street, but in the early 19th century it was simply designated Lot #14. The tree, however, is located on a portion of what had been Lot #15. Jackson and his wife Mildred, along with a J. A. Cobb, sold their property to a Dr. Malthus Ward in 1832, the same year cited on a plaque as being the date of the tree's deed. The Clarke County real estate indices contain <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> when or from whom Jackson originally purchased {{the property}}, although much of the land in that area is reported to have belonged to a Major James Meriwether. Even though Jackson may have lived near the tree as an adult, his childhood was actually spent in Jefferson County, not in Athens, making it less likely that he had experienced idyllic childhood summers playing beneath the tree's branches.|$|E

5|$|Caligari {{was filmed}} in the Lixie-Atelier film studio (formerly owned by Continental-Kunstfilm) at 9 Franz Joseph-Strasse (now Max Liebermannstraße), Weißensee, a {{north-eastern}} suburb of Berlin. Decla {{had been making}} films at the Lixie studio since October 1919, having previously released three titles, Die Pest in Florenz (1919) and the two parts of Fritz Lang's The Spiders (Die Spinnen). The relatively small size of the studio (built some five years earlier in 1914) meant most of the sets used in the film do not exceed six meters in width and depth. Certain elements from the original script had to be cut from the film due to the limited space, including a procession of gypsies, a handcart pushed by Dr. Caligari, Jane's carriage, and a chase scene involving horse-cabs. Likewise, the script called for a fairground scene with roundabouts, barrel organs, sideshow barkers, performers and menageries, none {{of which could be}} achieved in the restrictive space. Instead, the scenes use a painting of the Holstenwall town as a background; throngs of people walk around two spinning merry-go-round props, which creates the impression of a carnival. The script also made references to modern elements like telephones, telegrams and electric light, but they were eliminated during the filming, leaving the final film's setting with <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> a specific time period.|$|E
