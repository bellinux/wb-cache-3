The periods of all terms larger than 0.0001&Prime; (about as accurately as one can measure) lie between 5.5 and 6798 days; for some reason (as with ocean tidal periods) they seem to avoid the range from 34.8 to 91 days, so it is customary to split the nutation into long-period and short-period terms. The long-period terms are calculated and mentioned in the almanacs, while the additional correction due to the short-period terms is usually taken from a table.|$|E

In this paper, for spinless systems, we show that in specific space groups at $ 4 N+ 2 $ fillings ($ 8 N+ 4 $ fillings including the spin degree of freedom), presence of the <b>nodal</b> <b>lines</b> is required regardless of the details of the systems. Here, the spinless systems refer to crystals where the spin-orbit coupling is negligible and the spin degree of freedom can be omitted because of the SU(2) spin degeneracy. In this case the shape of the band structure around these <b>nodal</b> <b>lines</b> is like an hourglass, and we call this a spinless hourglass nodal-line semimetal. We construct a model Hamiltonian as an example and we show that it is always in the spinless hourglass nodal-line semimetal phase even when the model parameters are changed without changing the symmetries of the system. We also establish {{a list of all the}} centrosymmetric space groups, under which spinless systems always have hourglass <b>nodal</b> <b>lines,</b> and illustrate where the <b>nodal</b> <b>lines</b> are located.

40|$|Nodal-line semimetals (NLSs) {{represent}} {{a new type}} of topological semimetallic beyond Weyl and Dirac semimetals {{in the sense that they}} host closed loops or open curves of band degeneracies in the Brillouin zone. Parallel to the classification of type-I and type-II Weyl semimetals, there are two types of NLSs. The conventional NLS phase, in which the two bands forming the <b>nodal</b> <b>line</b> have opposite signs for their slopes along any direction perpendicular to the <b>nodal</b> <b>line,</b> has been proposed and realized in many compounds, whereas the exotic type-II NLS is very rare. Our first-principles calculations show that Mg_ 3 Bi_ 2 is a material candidate that hosts a single type-II nodal loop around Γ. The band crossing is close to the Fermi level and the two crossing bands have the same sign in their slopes along the radial direction of the loop, indicating the type-II nature of the <b>nodal</b> <b>line.</b> Spin-orbit coupling generates only a small energy gap (∼ 35 meV) at the nodal points and does not negate the band dispersion of Mg_ 3 Bi_ 2 that yields the type-II <b>nodal</b> <b>line.</b> Based on this prediction we have synthesized Mg_ 3 Bi_ 2 single crystals and confirmed the presence of the type-II nodal lines in the material.

40|$|The {{peculiar}} {{shape of}} the Fermi surface of topological <b>nodal</b> <b>line</b> semimetals at low carrier concentrations results in their unusual optical and transport properties. We analytically investigate the linear optical responses of three and two-dimensional <b>nodal</b> <b>line</b> semimetals using the Kubo formula. The optical conductivity of a three-dimensional <b>nodal</b> <b>line</b> semimetal is anisotropic. Along the axial direction (i. e., the direction perpendicular to the nodal-ring plane), the Drude weight has a linear dependence on the chemical potential at both low and high carrier dopings. For the radial direction (i. e., the direction parallel to the nodal-ring plane), this dependence changes from linear into quadratic in the transition from low into high carrier concentration. The interband contribution into optical conductivity is also anisotropic. In particular, at large frequencies, it saturates to a constant value for the axial direction and linearly increases with frequency along the radial direction. In two-dimensional <b>nodal</b> <b>line</b> semimetals, no interband optical transition could be induced and the only contribution to the optical conductivity arises from the intraband excitations.
