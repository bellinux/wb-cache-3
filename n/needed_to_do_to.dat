Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E

An angry-looking Yemi replies, [...] "You speak to me as if I were your brother" [...] as he retreats into the jungle. Eko follows him asking [...] "Who are you?!", and then finds the smoke monster. An arm of smoke attacks Eko, beating him into trees before he is slammed into the ground. Locke and the others rush out of the station to find a bloodied Eko. Locke {{approaches}} Eko, who whispers his dying words into Locke's ears. Sayid asks what he said, and Locke replies, [...] "We're next." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} met with mixed to {{negative}} reviews from music critics. AllMusic {{gave it a}} mixed review and said: [...] "Where the full-length debut showed sparks of character and invention beneath industrial metal sludge, Smells Like Children is a smartly crafted horror show, filled with vulgarity, ugliness, goth freaks, and sideshow scares. Manson wisely chose to heighten his cartoonish personality with the EP. Most of the record is devoted to spoken words and samples, all designed to push the outrage buttons of middle America. Musically, it may not amount to much—it's goth-metal-industrial, {{as good as the}} [...] "Dope Hat," [...] "Lunchbox," [...] and [...] "Cake and Sodomy" [...] trilogy that distinguished the debut—but as a sonic sculpture, as an objet d'art, it's effective and wickedly fascinating. It's exactly what Brian Warner <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> establish Marilyn Manson as America's bogeyman for the late '90s." ...|$|E

Plame has characterized the damage as [...] "serious", noting, [...] "I can tell you, all the intelligence services {{in the world that}} morning were running my name through their databases to see, `Did anyone by this name come in the country?

Within the Islamic judicial system the Armenians had no recourse, a Muslim was allowed to request a hearing before a religious court, in which testimony from non-Muslims would be disallowed or given little value. All a Muslim <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> get a case settled was swear on the Koran. Because of this the Armenians, as well as other dhimmi, had little hope within the judicial system.

2500|$|Bethesda {{announced}} at their press {{conference at the}} Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016 in June {{that they would be}} publishing a reboot of Prey, also titled Prey to be developed by Arkane Studios. This game will not use any of the materials developed for Prey 2, outside of the IP and the franchise concepts. Arkane Studios CEO and director Raphaël Colantonio said {{that at the time of}} completing Dishonored, they sought to do a second project alongside Dishonored 2, one that was [...] "in first-person, with depth and simulation and narration", and that they opted to use the Prey narrative as it matched these thematic concepts well, but otherwise greatly different in gameplay. Hines added that when considering the core concept of the original 2006 Prey was about aliens chasing after the player-character, they felt the name worked well for the game that Arkane had pitched, and they did not have to be beholden to retain anything else about the original game. This gave Arkane's team the freedom it <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> complete their game without needing to consider the franchise's past history.|$|E

[...] Rabbi Ammi analogized from this teaching of Rabbi Jose that people who learn only one chapter of Torah in the morning and one chapter in the evening have nonetheless fulfilled the precept of [...] that [...] "this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate therein day and night." [...] Rabbi Johanan said in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai that even people who read just the Shema (...) morning and evening thereby fulfill the precept of [...] Rabbi Johanan taught that it is forbidden, however, to teach this to people who through ignorance are careless in the observance of the laws (as it might deter them from further Torah study). But Rava taught that it is meritorious to say it in their presence (as they might think that if merely reciting the Shema twice daily earns reward, how great would the reward be for devoting more time to Torah study).|$|E
