500|$|Lee {{was born}} in Marylebone, London on 26 October 1890, the eldest of three boys, all of whom progressed to play {{first-class}} cricket. His father was a greengrocer and a coal merchant who followed cricket closely in the London evening papers. During Lee's youth, he developed his cricket by playing against lamp-posts, and reflected in his autobiography that: [...] "If a bowler can clean bowl a man <b>nine</b> <b>times</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ten against a lamp-post, he will not miss a full-sized wicket when he gets the chance." [...] His cricketing talent was encouraged at school; he first attended Barrett Street School and then St. Thomas's School in Portman Square. Both schools had headmasters who were sports enthusiasts, and at St. Thomas's the headmaster, Mr. Despicht, offered a penny to any schoolboy who could bowl him out, a feat Lee achieved regularly. Mr. Despicht also taught Lee to concentrate on bowling a good length, and Lee played primarily as a bowler during his school years. During his final year at St. Thomas's, the school reached {{the final of the}} local Church School's League Shield, and Lee earned victory for his school with six wickets. When Lee left school, he worked with his father as a greengrocer, a job he liked, but not enough to stop him writing a letter to the Marylebone Cricket Club, asking for a job on the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the presence of pain, pain duration, localization(s), intensity, type and pharmacological treatment among older adults living in sheltered accommodation or receiving rehabilitation, {{as well as the}} agreement between pain assessments performed by staff and the older adults. Twenty-nine randomly selected older adults (65 + years) and the staff who looked after them participated in a structured interview based on standardized measures for pain assessment and physical, intellectual and communicative functions. Pain was found to be common, with a majority of participants experiencing it every day or all <b>of</b> the <b>time.</b> <b>Nine</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 22 of the older adults in pain had no pain relief drugs at all. Agreement between assessments by the older adults and the staff was no higher than moderate and in general pain levels were underestimated.

The provision of good nursing care for older adults in sheltered accommodation requires systematic routines for frequent pain assessments...|$|R
40|$|This study {{introduces}} a map for a therapeutic conversation and assesses its effectiveness. The {{evidence for this}} proposal {{is provided by the}} study reported, in which a number of measures were taken to ascertain whether the therapeutic process promoted useful change in clients with maladaptive assumptive systems (problem narratives), and whether those changes were sustained over <b>time.</b> <b>Nine</b> clients <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a sample of twenty- three responded and all nine respondents reported sustained changes over a period of 6 - 24 months. Michael White (2007) suggests that Narrative maps are few, but are important so that processes used by clinicians do not become lost, and are at the same time able to be evaluated, assessed and implemented by other professionals. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was taken to analyse the adaptive client narratives that occurred immediately post therapy, and which remained 6 - 24 months later. A number of themes emerged that revealed a spiritual or ‘wairua’ approach to assuming the adaptive narrative, and there was evidence to suggest that a more resourceful state of beingness (adaptive identity) had emerged and evolved as a result this. The themes point to new initiatives for dealing with the problem emerging via the processes of innovative moments and adaptive reframing. The proposed therapeutic map appeared to be successful and empowering for the respondents as they came to understand they have the power to ‘change the meaning they had assigned to the problem issue, without being defined by the problem issue as they were previously’. The individual seems to be able to perceive the problem {{through the eyes of the}} all-knowing self (higher self or spiritual self). When the meaning making and reconstruction emerges from within the client in this way, the writer proposes change is both significant and lasting- Identity Re- Referencing. It is not known if the clients who did not respond did so because they did not experience significant change, however the results would suggest that further research is warranted...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To obtain {{information}} from {{the members of the}} boards of devolved health care authorities and evaluate their orientations in meeting the expectations of provincial governments, local providers and community members. DESIGN: Mail survey, conducted in cooperation with the devolved authorities, in the summer of 1995. SETTING: Three provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island) with established boards and 2 (British Columbia and Nova Scotia) with immature boards. PARTICIPANTS: All 791 members of boards of devolved authorities in the 5 provinces, of whom 514 (65 %) responded. OUTCOME MEASURES: Sociodemographic background, training, experience and activities of board members as well as their use of information. RESULTS: There were systematic differences between established and immature boards in regard to training, information use and actual and desired activities. Members spent 35 hours per month, on average, on work for their board. Members were largely middle-aged, well educated and well off. Only 36 % were employed full <b>time.</b> <b>Nine</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 10 had previous experience on boards, more often in health care than in social services. They were least pleased with their training in setting priorities and assessing health care needs and most pleased with their training in participating effectively in meetings and understanding their roles and responsibilities. The information for decision-making most available to them was information on service costs (68 % said it was available "most of the time" or "always") and utilization (64 %); the least available information was that on key informants' opinions (47 %), service benefits (37 %) and citizens' preferences (28 %). Board activity was dominated by setting priorities and assessing needs, secondarily occupied with ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of services and allocating funds, and least concerned with delivering services and raising revenue. The match between activities desired by members and actual activities was significantly poorer for members of immature boards than for those of established boards. CONCLUSIONS: The responses concerning these structural variables suggest that board members are most likely to meet the expectations of provincial governments. Fewer appear well equipped to accommodate the views of their providers and even fewer to incorporate the perspectives of their community...|$|R
40|$|Efforts in {{managing}} diabetes, including the medical advances in novel therapies {{and public health}} policies of disease control and prevention, have not reduced the disease prevalence since 1990 s. I analyze this phenomenon from the technology and policy viewpoints underlying diabetes treatment and prevention, {{in order to control}} and manage the disease in a cost-benefit balanced manner. The innovative performance of the antidiabetic drug therapy is investigated by analyzing the fifteen New Drug Applications (NDAs) of the antidiabetics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration since the early 1990 s. I examine the characteristics of the clinical trials supporting NDAs and observe how the complexity of clinical trials has changed over <b>time.</b> <b>Nine</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the twenty-five selected indicators are found to exhibit an increasing trend of complexity. The trend is more pronounced in the oral antiglycemics group (seven indicators) than the subcutaneous group (two indicators). Interestingly, this trend in increasing complexity in clinical trials is generally consistent with that of the increasing R&D costs in the pharmaceutical industry, possibly account for the declining innovative performance of the industry over the time period under investigation. A system dynamics approach is applied to assess current public health policies in diabetes control and prevention. (cont.) The benefit of system thinking is to avoid potential policy resistance by identifying the problematic characteristics of the system, such as time-delays, feedback, and structure of stocks and flows. For diabetes management, the public health system can be considered a "dynamic-complex" system in terms of current policy made by the National Diabetes Control and Prevention Program. Despite providing earlier and expanded screening as well as improved availability and accessibility of treatment for diabetes, the policy results in the increase of prevalence. More undiagnosed people are diagnosed, thus increasing the incidence, whereas people already diagnosed prolong their lifespan due to the better and more accessible medical care. A future successful chronic disease management program should systematically integrate the efforts from both the treatment and prevention perspectives. by Hsiao-Lan Sharon Lin. Thesis (S. M.)
