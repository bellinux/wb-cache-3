Efficient heat dissipation {{is a key}} factor for the reliability and stability of topological semimetal-based <b>nano-electronics</b> <b>devices,</b> which {{is closely related to}} high thermal conductivity. In this work, the elastic properties and lattice thermal conductivity of TaN are investigated by first-principles calculations and the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA). According to the calculated bulk modulus, shear modulus and C_ 44, TaN can be regarded as a potential incompressible and hard material. The room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity is predicted to be 838. 62 W m^- 1 K^- 1 along a axis and 1080. 40 W m^- 1 K^- 1 along c axis, showing very strong anisotropy. It is found that the lattice thermal conductivity of TaN is several tens of times higher than one of other topological semimetal, such as TaAs, MoP and ZrTe, which is due to very longer phonon lifetimes for TaN than other topological semimetal. The very different atomic masses of Ta and N atoms lead to a very large acoustic-optical band gap, and then prohibits the scattering between acoustic and optical phonon modes, which gives rise to very long phonon lifetimes. Based on mass difference factor, the WC and WN can be regarded as potential candidates with ultrahigh lattice thermal conductivity. Calculated results show that isotope scattering has little effect on lattice thermal conductivity, and that phonon with mean free path(MFP) larger than 20 (80) μ m at 300 K has little contribution to the total lattice thermal conductivity. This work implies that TaN-based <b>nano-electronics</b> <b>devices</b> may be more stable and reliable due to efficient heat dissipation. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|Non-equilibrium plasmas {{have been}} used as one of the {{principal}} technologies for development of microelectronics and they are the basis for the development of new generations of <b>nano-electronics</b> <b>devices</b> required for 65 and 40 nm technologies. Microdischarges recently have become more common in everyday life. Technology of plasma etching has enabled us to develop such discharges and the field of microdischarges has grown into the most interesting field of the physics of collisional non-equilibrium plasmas. Recently, an effort to fabricate microplasma sources that can be integrated with other MEMS devices to form larger Microsystems has been made. Plasma-based microsystems can find application in bio-microelectro- mechanical system (bio-MEMS) sterilization, small-scale materials processing and microchemical analysis systems.

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of methods to isolate graphene, a one-atom-thick layer of crystalline carbon, {{has raised the}} possibility of a new class of <b>nano-electronics</b> <b>devices</b> based on the extraordinary electrical transport and unusual physical properties of this material. However, the experimental realization of devices displaying these properties was, until now, hampered by the influence of the ambient environment, primarily the substrate. Here we report on the fabrication of Suspended Graphene devices and on studies of their electrical transport properties. In these devices, environmental disturbances were minimized allowing unprecedented access to the intrinsic properties of graphene close to the Dirac Point (DP) where the energy dispersion of the carriers and their density-of-states vanish linearly giving rise to a range of exotic physical properties. We show that charge inhomogeneity is reduced by almost one order of magnitude compared to that in Non-Suspended Graphene devices. Moreover, near the DP, the mobility exceeds 100, 000 cm 2 /Vs, approaching theoretical predictions for evanescent transport in the ballistic model. Comment: 18 pages, 4 figur...|$|R

Theoretical studies of the contact resistance of CNTs using the first principles and experimental investigations into the effect of metal work function on the interface barrier were introduced. Results show that the contact resistance is low {{when there is a}} weak hybrid effect and large contact length between the metal and CNTs, and the closer the work function of the metal to that of the CNTs, the lower the barrier height. The commonly used methods for improving the contact resistance of CNTs, including ultrasonic nanowelding, high temperature annealing, metal deposition, and local Joule heating were presented, and the improvement of device performance using these methods was analysed. Among these methods, local Joule heating is more ideal at present time since it is with the advantages of simple operation, high degree of automation, less device damage, and low cost...|$|R
40|$|Recently, three-component new fermions in topological {{semimetal}} MoP are experimentally observed, {{which may}} have potential applications like topological qubits, low-power electronics and spintronics. These {{are closely related to}} thermal transport properties of MoP. In this work, the phonon transport of MoP is investigated by solving the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA). The calculated room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity is 18. 41 W m^- 1 K^- 1 and 34. 71 W m^- 1 K^- 1 along the in- and cross-plane directions, exhibiting very strong anisotropy. The isotope and size effects on the lattice thermal conductivity are also considered. It is found that isotope scattering produces little effect, and phonon has little contribution to the lattice thermal conductivity, when phonon mean free path(MFP) is larger than 0. 15 μ m at 300 K. It is noted that average room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of MoP is lower than that of representative Weyl semimetal TaAs, which is due to smaller group velocities and larger Grüneisen parameters. Our works provide valuable informations for the thermal management of MoP-based <b>nano-electronics</b> <b>devices,</b> and motivate further experimental works to study thermal transport of MoP.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem for}} {{simulation}} ultra-fast carrier transport in <b>nano-electronics</b> <b>devices</b> {{is a large}} scale computational problem and requires HPC and/or Grid computing resources. The most widely used techniques for modeling this carrier transport are Monte Carlo methods. In this work we consider a set of stochastic algorithms for solving quantum kinetic equations describing quantum effects during the femtosecond relaxation process due to electron-phonon interaction in one-band semiconductors or quantum wires. The algorithms are integrated in a Grid-enabled package named Stochas-tic ALgorithms for Ultra-fast Transport in sEmiconductors (SALUTE). There are two main reasons for running this package on the computational Grid: (i) quantum problems are very computationally intensive; (ii) the inherently parallel nature of Monte Carlo applications makes efficient use of Grid resources. Grid (distributed) Monte Carlo applications require that the underlying random number streams in each subtask are independent in a statistical sense. The efficient application of quasi-Monte Carlo algorithms entails additional difficulties due {{to the possibility of}} job failures and the inhomogeneous nature of the Grid resource. In this paper we study the quasi-random approach in SALUTE and the performance of the corresponding algorithms on the grid, using the scrambled Halton, Sobol and Niederreiter sequences. A large number of tests have been performed on the EGEE and SEEGRID grid infrastructures using specially developed grid implementation scheme. Novel results for energy and density distribution, obtained in the inhomogeneous case with applied electric field are presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method of {{preparation}} of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) specimens of nano-electronic devices with Focused Ion Beam (FIB) tools that significantly reduces specimen thickness variation over the area of interest. The general methodology {{is a combination of}} and an extension to Micro-Sampling FIB specimen preparation technique described by T. Kamino et. al. [1] and the back-side milling method [2]. An example of milling curtains obscuring the interface between tungsten filled contact and Si-substrate in a Flash memory device is shown in Figure 1. Our method re-directs ion flow to avoid formation of curtains in the target area. In this example, we use FEI Strata- 400 DB-FIB equipped with FlipStage ™ and Omniprober 200 ™ as efficient means of accomplishing specimen rotation. However we envision that the general idea behind this method can be adapted to various FIB/micromanipulator platforms and to a bulk specimen preparation from a multi-phase material where there exist vast density variations that lead to formation of milling curtains. The essence of the method dictates preparation of the specimen from a direction that allows direct access to the feature of interest through uniform material and avoids milling through tough materials above. Without further ado, the method starts by routine preparation steps to produce targeted specimen of the feature of interest. In case of <b>nano-electronics</b> <b>devices,</b> stage navigation with design CAD layout, or defect review maps can be used to locate the target.

40|$|Various {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) {{materials with}} graphene-like buckled structure emerge, and the β-phase AsP monolayer has been recently proposed to be thermodynamically stable from first-principles calculations. The studies of thermal transport are very useful for these 2 D materials-based <b>nano-electronics</b> <b>devices.</b> Motivated by this, a {{comparative study of}} strain-dependent phonon transport of AsP monolayer is performed by solving the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA). It is found that the lattice thermal conductivity (κ_L) of AsP monolayer {{is very close to}} one of As monolayer with similar buckled structure, which is due to neutralization between the reduce of phonon lifetimes and group velocity enhancement from As to AsP monolayer. The corresponding room-temperature sheet thermal conductance of AsP monolayer is 152. 5 W K^- 1. It is noted that the increasing tensile strain can harden long wavelength out-of-plane (ZA) acoustic mode, and soften the in-plane longitudinal acoustic (LA) and transversal acoustic (TA) modes. Calculated results show that κ_L of AsP monolayer presents a nonmonotonic up-and-down behavior with increased strain. The unusual strain dependence is due to the competition among reduce of phonon group velocities, improved phonon lifetimes of ZA mode and nonmonotonic up-and-down phonon lifetimes of TA/LA mode. It is found that acoustic branches dominate the κ_L in considered strain range, and the contribution from ZA branch increases with increased strain, while it is opposite for TA/LA branch. By analyzing cumulative κ_L with respect to phonon mean free path (MFP), tensile strain can modulate effectively size effects on κ_L in AsP monolayer. Comment: 8 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

In this thesis the capability for the heteroepitaxial growth of a proof-of-principle core-shell LED is advanced. A design that can be applied at the wafer scale using metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) crystal growth on highly uniform GaN nanorod (NR) structures is proposed. This project demonstrates understanding over the growth constraints of active layers and dopant layers. The impact of reactor pressure and temperature on the morphology and on the incorporated InN mole fraction was studied for thick InGaN shells on the different GaN crystal facets. Mg doping and effectiveness of the p-n junction for a core-shell structure was studied by extensive growth experiments and characterization. Sapphire and Si substrates were used, and at all the stages of growth and fabrication. The structures were optimized to achieve geometry homogeneity, high-aspect-ratio, incorporation homogeneity for InN and Mg dopant. The three-dimensional nature of NRs and their light emission provided ample challenges which required adaptation of characterization and fabrication techniques for a core-shell device.

For example, discussed in this work, a derivative of tetrathiafulvalene, which exhibits a unique loss of conductivity upon compression of the self-assembled monolayer could be developed into a molecular switch. This work also compares tunable organic (tetraphenylethylene tetracarboxylic acid and bis(pyridine) s assemblies) and metal-organic (Silver-stilbizole coordination compounds) crystals which show high electrical conductivity. The electrical properties of these materials vary depending on their composition allowing for the development of compositionally tunable functional materials. Additional work was done to investigate the effects of molecular environment on redox active 11 -ferroceneyl- 1 undecanethiol (Fc) molecules. The redox process of mixed monolayers of Fc and decanethiol was measured using conductive probe atomic force microscopy and force spectroscopy. As the concentration of Fc increased large, variations in the force were observed. Using these variations the number of oxidized molecules in the monolayer was determined.
