2500|$|Parliament {{decided that}} five Avinor {{airports}} {{would be allowed}} to issue ninety percent discount on take-off charges on international routes. This accounted in 2004 to NOK4,800 per flight for a Boeing 737-200. However, they still had to pay full terminal, security and air <b>navigation</b> <b>service</b> charges. This allowed Haugesund to establish itself as a [...] "low-cost" [...] airport for low-cost carriers. Ryanair started looking at Haugesund as a destination in 2002, hoping to serve both Rogaland and Hordaland from one airport. However, they demanded that the runway be lengthened if they were to use Karmøy. It launched its inaugural daily route to London Stansted Airport on 30 April 2003. By using the smaller Boeing 737-200 aircraft the airline could as an interim solution get by with the short runway—the shortest of any airport served by the airline.|$|E
2500|$|The Thames <b>Navigation</b> <b>Service</b> {{was first}} thought up between 1950 and 1952 by Cdr Peter de Neumann GM RN, {{when he was}} captain of HMRC Vigilant (HM Customs & Excise) based at Gravesend Reach. [...] This idea {{followed}} on from considering such incidents as the accidental ramming of HMS Truculent by the Divina in 1950, the collision with the Nore Forts by Baalbek, and the disastrous flooding of Canvey, Foulness and the East Coast in 1953. In these and other situations, rescue and intelligence gathering were severely hampered {{by a lack of}} centralised command and control, and lack of detailed [...] "picture". De Neumann resigned his command after returning Vigilant from the Spithead Review and joined the PLA, immediately suggesting in a report to them, submitted in 1953, that a feasibility study of such a system be commenced. [...] He then oversaw its development and ultimate installation at Gravesend.|$|E
