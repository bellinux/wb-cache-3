It {{was not clear}} if this <b>network</b> <b>drive</b> is for general use or for Uncharted 3 game assets and data. However, Balestra's comment seems to allude to the former, indicating {{that the purpose of}} the drive is for the game. A larger game typically translates into mo-cap and art assets, high-res textures, music, voice audio, more environments, more content, and as a result a more fulfilling game to play. Uncharted 3 will probably be the largest game to-date. According to Mick Hocking, the director of Sony WorldWide Studios' 3D team, Uncharted 3 [...] "will show a new level in 3D gaming". He went on [...] "Uncharted 3 in 3D will really convince people of our full-screen HD 3D solution... Genuinely, Uncharted 3 looks phenomenal in 3D." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{common problem}} that occurs with the drive letter {{assignment}} {{is that the}} letter assigned to a <b>network</b> <b>drive</b> can interfere with the letter of a local volume (like a newly installed CD/DVD drive or a USB stick). For example, if the last local drive is drive D: and a <b>network</b> <b>drive</b> would have been assigned as E:, then a newly attached USB mass storage device would also be assigned drive E: causing loss of connectivity with either the network share or the USB device. Users with administrative privileges can assign drive letters manually to overcome this problem.Another condition that can cause problems on Windows XP is when there are network drives defined, but in an error condition (as they would be on a laptop operating outside the network). Even when the unconnected <b>network</b> <b>drive</b> is not the next available drive letter, Windows XP {{may be unable to}} map a drive and this error may also prevent the mounting of the USB device.|$|E
