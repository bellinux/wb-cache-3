5|$|Because of its Ottoman past, Skopje {{has more}} mosques than churches. Religious {{communities}} often {{complain about the}} lack of infrastructure and <b>new</b> <b>places</b> of worship are often built. Skopje is the seat of many Macedonian religious organisations, such as the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Islamic Religious Union of Macedonia. It has an Orthodox cathedral and seminary, several madrasahs, a Roman Catholic cathedral and a synagogue.|$|E
5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came to arm the most {{important}} place. For technical reasons (distance of communication with bases) and because <b>new</b> <b>places</b> of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place. It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum {{was built on the}} old police site. The complex has a wall listing all the names of the fallen soldiers since the War Of Independence, and a monument to the glory of the heroes and another for reverence. The museum has nearly 200 tanks and other armoured vehicles of many kinds.|$|E
5|$|As in Red Dead Redemption, {{the player}} can diverge {{from the main}} story on side quests: {{requests}} from strangers, checklist challenges, and other digressions. These missions are similar in format {{to those of the}} original but their objectives are replaced to fit the zombie horror theme. For example, the player hunts for family members instead of fugitives or empties graveyards instead of gang hideouts. Marston is called to liberate towns overrun by the undead, which unlocks ammo, <b>new</b> <b>places</b> to stay, quests, and the assistance of the living townspeople. After Marston's assistance, the towns remain free of zombies for several in-game days, but will eventually require the player's assistance when zombies return once again. The player decides whether to share ammunition with the townsfolk: ammunition serves as a currency in the game since the shops have closed. The player has fewer correctives for immorality, such as helping or killing other survivors, given the dire circumstances. The game puts a greater emphasis on hyperbolic fun.|$|E

5|$|The Kirk {{began to}} concern itself with {{providing}} {{churches in the}} new towns and relatively thinly supplied Highlands, establishing a church extension committee in 1828. Led by Thomas Chalmers, by the early 1840s it had added 222 churches, largely through public subscription. When the Great Disruption occurred in 1843, and roughly a third of ministers and their congregations left the established church and its buildings to form the Free Church of Scotland, Chalmers' organisational skills helped the Free Church build over 700 <b>new</b> <b>places</b> of worship by 1847. The established church took time to recover, but embarked on a rival programme of church building, increasing its number of parishes from 924 in 1843 to 1,437 by 1909. The intense competition between different denominations {{led to the creation}} of grand churches with tall steeples and ultimately resulted in an oversupply of churches, which would be a financial burden to future generations.|$|E
5|$|In this game, Mario {{is joined}} by a robotic {{backpack}} named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away goop and help Mario reach <b>new</b> <b>places.</b> Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Squirt and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Squirt nozzle lets Mario spray a stream of water which he can use to clean sludge, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. The Hover nozzle lets Mario hover {{in the air for}} a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can be substituted with the Hover nozzle: the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles use water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit he asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot. Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which change his color, depending on the type of fruit. Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water. Juice can be replenished by eating more fruit.|$|E

25|$|Washington D.C.'s The Faith took {{hardcore}} punk to <b>new</b> <b>places</b> in {{the early}} 1980s. Even during their existence, their music hinted at what was to come, softening the standard-issue hardcore approach somewhat with better-developed melodies and a more inward-looking perspective. To be sure, it was high-energy, high-velocity punk, but its subtle deviations from the norm opened up new vistas for the D.C. scene.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked who}} the models for her characters, Loos would almost always {{say they were}} {{composites}} of various people, but when pressed, admitted that toothless flirt Sir Francis Beekman was modeled after writer Joseph Hergesheimer and producer Jesse L.

Dorothy Shaw was modeled after herself and Constance Talmadge, and Lorelei herself most closely resembled acquisitive Ziegfeld showgirl, Lillian Lorraine, who was always looking for <b>new</b> <b>places</b> to display the diamonds bestowed by her suitors.|$|E
25|$|Many of Lake Minnetonka's {{visitors}} began finding <b>new</b> <b>places</b> {{to vacation}} as the railroads expanded westward in the 1890s, causing {{most of the}} lake's hotels and steamboats to suffer financially and cease operations. Some hotels burned during this time, but most were demolished or dismantled. By 1900, however, {{an increasing number of}} families had begun to construct private summer cottages around Lake Minnetonka. Permanent homes and grand estates also began to appear around the lake as the Twin Cities metropolitan area grew. Some of these homes and cottages still exist, including the Thompson Summer House in Minnetonka Beach.|$|E

25|$|Most of Lincolnshire {{still has}} grammar schools. In Stamford, {{the place of}} grammar schools was long filled by a form of the Assisted Places Scheme that {{provided}} state funding to send children {{to one of the}} two independent schools in the town that were formerly direct-grant grammars. The national scheme was abolished by the 1997 Labour government. The Stamford arrangements remained in place as an increasingly protracted transitional arrangement. In 2008, the council decided no <b>new</b> <b>places</b> could be funded and the arrangement finally ended in 2012. The rest of South Kesteven, apart from Market Deeping, has the selective system.|$|E
25|$|They came {{together}} through music. Through their fondness for innovation and {{their desire to}} transcend boundaries. They {{came together}} through an awareness, surrounded by hazards.

They are inspired by {{the freedom to choose}} and experiment; to travel, carrying their memories, to <b>new</b> <b>places</b> resplendent with the colors of life and humanity. Marcel, Rami, and Bachar Khalife are engaged today in a new journey of togetherness and joint artistic work that began in the year 2000 when both Rami and Bachar joined Al Mayadine Ensemble that Marcel established in the late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The Industrial Revolution on Continental Europe came {{a little}} later than in Great Britain. In many industries, this {{involved}} the application of technology developed in Britain in <b>new</b> <b>places.</b> Often the technology was purchased from Britain or British engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities. By 1809, part of the Ruhr Valley in Westphalia was called 'Miniature England' because of its similarities to the industrial areas of England. The German, Russian and Belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries. In some cases (such as iron), the different availability of resources locally meant that only {{some aspects of the}} British technology were adopted.|$|E

25|$|Jews {{lived in}} at least forty-three Jewish {{communities}} in Palestine: twelve towns on the coast, in the Negev, and east of the Jordan, and thirty-one villages in Galilee and in the Jordan valley. The persecuted Jews of Palestine revolted twice against their Christian rulers. In the 5th century, the Western Roman Empire collapsed leading to Christian migration into Palestine and development of a Christian majority. Jews numbered 10–15% of the population. Judaism was the only non-Christian religion tolerated, but there were bans on Jews building <b>new</b> <b>places</b> of worship, holding public office or owning slaves. There were also two Samaritan revolts during this period.|$|E
25|$|A place cell {{is a type}} of {{pyramidal}} neuron within the hippocampus that becomes active when an animal enters a particular place in its environment; this place is known as the place field. A given place cell will have only one, or a few, place fields in a typical small laboratory environment, but more in a larger region. There is no apparent topography to the pattern of place fields, unlike other brain areas such as visual cortex—neighboring place cells are as likely to have nearby fields as distant ones. In a different environment, typically about half the place cells will still have place fields, but these will be in <b>new</b> <b>places</b> unrelated to their former locations.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the construction of}} new schools and libraries, many <b>new</b> <b>places</b> of worship were built in the downtown area. Although many of them have been demolished or converted to other purposes, several continue to offer religious services, such as Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church (1869) on West Vermont Street, Saint John the Evangelist Catholic Church (1867–71) on South Capitol Avenue, Roberts Park United Methodist Church (1870–76) at Delaware and Vermont Streets, Lockerbie Square United Methodist Church (1883) on North East Street, and Central Christian Church (1892) at the corner of Fort Wayne Avenue and Walnut Street, among others. In addition, the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Vincennes, Indiana, moved to Indianapolis in 1878, and its name was changed to the Diocese of Indianapolis in 1898.|$|E

Its growing ashrama residents hub, however, represented a wide cross-section of the Indian society, with disciples from both educated urban and simple rural milieus. Householder disciples and sympathizers supported the temples with funds, food, and volunteer labour. The Gaudiya Math centres paid serious attention to the individual discipline of their residents, including mandatory ascetic vows and daily practice of devotion (bhakti) centred on individual recitation (japa) and public singing (kirtan) of Krishna's names, regular study of philosophical and devotional texts (svadhyaya), traditional worship of temple images of Krishna and Chaitanya (archana) as well as attendance at lectures and seminars (shravanam).|$|E

Shaw also argued further that the album was a classic and, as a whole, [...] "simply genius"; considering [...] "the masterstroke of the collection is in the thread that ties each disparate view into one singular perspective".
