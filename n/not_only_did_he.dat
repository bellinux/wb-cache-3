5|$|The goddess he worshipped {{the most}} zealously, however, was Minerva. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> keep a {{personal}} shrine dedicated {{to her in}} his bedroom, she regularly appeared on his coinage—in four different attested reverse types—and he founded a legion, Legio I Minervia, in her name.|$|E
5|$|The second {{hypothesis}} holds that Userkaf chose {{to return to}} 3rd dynasty (c. 2670–2610 BC) traditions: <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> choose to construct his mortuary complex on the north-east corner of Djoser's complex but its layout {{is similar to that}} of Djoser. Indeed, both are organized on a north–south axis and both have their entrances located at the south-end of the eastern side.|$|E
5|$|The courts {{eventually}} {{decided the}} Warner Bros. lawsuit in Cagney's favor. He {{had done what}} many thought unthinkable: taking on the studios and winning. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> win, but Warner Bros. also {{knew that he was}} still their foremost box office draw and invited him back for a five-year, $150,000-a-film deal, with no more than two pictures a year. Cagney also had full say over what films he did and did not make. Additionally, William Cagney was guaranteed the position of assistant producer for the movies in which his brother starred.|$|E

5|$|Domitian also {{revived the}} {{practice}} of the imperial cult, which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and Cassius Dio allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of Dominus et Deus. However, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> reject the title of Dominus during his reign, but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.|$|E
5|$|In 64 emperor Nero {{appointed}} Gessius Florus as procurator of the Judaea Province. During his administration, the Jews were systematically {{discriminated against}} {{in favour of}} the Greek population of the region. Tensions quickly rose to civil unrest when Florus plundered the treasury of the Temple of Jerusalem {{under the guise of}} imperial taxes. Following riots, the instigators were arrested and crucified by the Romans. Appalled at the treatment of her countrymen, Berenice travelled to Jerusalem in 66 to personally petition Florus to spare the Jews, but <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> refuse to comply with her requests, Berenice herself was nearly killed during skirmishes in the city. Likewise a plea for assistance to the legate of Syria, Cestius Gallus, met with no response.|$|E
5|$|Fauré {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1909, after his {{father-in-law}} and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société Musicale Indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid. During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.|$|E

5|$|However, Boston's {{chances of}} getting Russell seemed slim. Because the Celtics had {{finished}} second in the previous season and the worst teams had the highest draft picks, the Celtics had slipped too low in the draft order to pick Russell. In addition, Auerbach had already used his territorial pick to acquire talented forward Tom Heinsohn. But Auerbach knew that the Rochester Royals, who owned the first draft pick, already had a skilled rebounder in Maurice Stokes, were looking for an outside shooting guard and were unwilling to pay Russell the $25,000 signing bonus he requested. The St. Louis Hawks, who owned the second pick, drafted Russell, but were vying for Celtics center Ed Macauley, a six-time All-Star who had roots in St. Louis. Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley, who had previously asked to be traded to St. Louis in order to be with his sick son, if the Hawks gave up Russell. The owner of St Louis called Auerbach later and demanded more in the trade. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> want Macauley, who was the Celtics premier player at the time, he wanted Cliff Hagan, who had been serving in the military for three years and had not yet played for the Celtics. After much debate, Auerbach agreed to give up Hagan, and the Hawks made the trade.|$|E

The theory of Lie groups was systematically reworked in modern mathematical language in a monograph by Claude Chevalley.|$|E
25|$|Washington {{immediately}} instructed Stirling and Stephen {{to march}} north toward Birmingham Meeting House, {{a place of}} Quaker worship.
