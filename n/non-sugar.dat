The effect of phosphate input for further improvement of the efficiency of adsorption in the juice purification process was also studied. The effect of flow of activated filtroperlit on II saturation filtration speed was studied.

Sugar beet digging {{in the first period}} was done on 13 thand 14 thSeptember, and 34 days later in the second period (18 thand 19 thOctober). Weather conditions between the terms of digging were characterized by shortage in precipitation when compared to the multiyear average, which influenced autumn growth and technological maturation of sugar beet root. Prolonged vegetation period for 34 days in the second term of digging in the trial with leaves preserved (fungicide application) for two locations on the average resulted in root yield increase by 9. 75 t/ha i. e. 11. 34 %, sugar content by 0. 79 % and pure sugar yield by 2. 17 t/ha. Consequently, {{in the second half of}} September and the first half of October root yield was daily increased by 278 kg/ha, sugar content by 0. 02 % and pure sugar yield by 63. 8 kg/ha.

40|$|Summary. Application of slanted {{diffusers}} {{is accompanied}} with irregular heating of juice- and chips mixture {{in the unit}} length, which reduces the degree of extraction of sucrose from chips and microorganisms intensive growth inside the apparatuses, increases the sucrose loss during the extraction {{and the time of}} the whole process. A method for preprocessing of beet chips prior to extraction with hot solutions of chemical agents was suggested. It was experimentally found out that the best quality indicators are inherent to the juice obtained from chips treated with a solution of 0. 05 % aluminum sulfate or with 0. 10 % bleach solution. Thermal processing of beet chips with the solutions of Al 2 (SO 4) 3 with a concentration of 0. 05 % and bleach with a concentration of 0. 10 % results in a gradual beet chips uniform heating and denaturation of the proteins, which increases the mass transfer coefficient of sugarbeet tissue, increasing its permeability. Beet chips surface washing aluminum sulfate solution reduces the solubility of the protein and pectin substances, increasing the strength and elasticity of beet chips. pH of the medium is stabilized, which reduces the transition of <b>non-sugars</b> from beet chips into the diffusion juice in the process of sucrose extraction. Combination of thermal and chemical treatment allows to stabilize the colloids of sugarbeet tissue and to heat beet chips to the optimum temperature of the diffusion process of 70 - 72 °C before entering the diffusion apparatus and to improve its structural and mechanical properties. The use of preliminary heat treatment of beet chips: improves the efficiency of diffusion processes; blocks the transition of substances of protein-pectin complex of beet chips into the raw juice, whereby their content in the diffusion juice is reduced; reduces the color of purified juice by 15. 1 %, the content of calcium salts by 31. 3 % in comparison with the standard method; -improves the purity of the purified juice by 1. 2 %.

40|$|A {{review of}} the general chromatographic theory and of {{continuous}} chromatographic techniques has been carried out. Three methods of inversion of sucrose to glucose and fructose in beet molasses were explored. These methods were the inversion of sucrose using the enzyme invertase, {{by the use of}} hydrochloric acid {{and the use of the}} resin Amberlite IR 118 in the H+ form. The preferred method on economic and purity considerations was by the use of the enzyme invertase. The continuous chromatographic separation of inverted beet molasses resulting in a fructose rich product and a product containing glucose and other <b>non-sugars</b> was carried out using a semi-continuous counter-current chromatographic refiner (SCCR 6), consisting of ten 10. 8 cm x 75 cm long stainless steel columns packed with a calcium charged 8 % cross-linked polystyrene resin Zerolit SRC 14. Based on the literature this is the first time such a continuous separation has been attempted. It was found that the cations present in beet molasses displaced the calcium ions from the resin resulting in poor separation of the glucose and fructose. Three methods of maintaining the calcium form of the resin during the continuous operation of the equipment were established. Passing a solution of calcium nitrate through the purge column for half a switch period was found to be most effective as there was no contamination of the main fructose rich product and the product concentrations were increased by 50 %. When a 53 % total solids (53 Brix) molasses feedstock was used, the throughput was 34. 13 kg sugar solids per m 3 of resin per hour. Product purities of 97 % fructose in fructose rich (FRP) and 96 % glucose in the glucose rich (GRP) products were obtained with product concentrations of 10. 93 %w/w for the FRP and 10. 07 %w/w for the GRP.

It probably happens because the digestive system senses and signals forthcoming delivery of sugars, inhibiting fatty acid release and oxidation, and starving glycogen-less muscle cells of the sole available source of energy. Even simple continuous exercise, like walking or washing dishes by hand right after the meal, may trigger rhabdomyolysis in the exercising muscles. This rhabdomyolysis is probably not of exertional, but of hypoglycemic nature, as loaded glycogen-less muscles can rapidly remove glucose from blood, and the normal mechanism of glucose homeostasis lacks the required responsiveness or capacity to prevent hypoglycemia. The broken down myocytes probably do not yield much glucose. Unlike the case with exertional rhabdomyolisys, there is no warning.

40|$|Aim:  To {{describe}} {{trends in}} purchasing patterns of non-alcoholic, water-based beverages (WBBs) in Australia, 1997 – 2006. Methods:  Trends in volume sales of WBBs were determined from data {{supplied by the}} Australian beverage industry, not including fruit juice or milk-based drinks. Change was calculated as per cent difference between 1997 and 2006, volume share by proportion of total sales in the category and per capita consumption by dividing total volume sales by population estimate for that year. Sugar supply from WBBs was calculated by multiplying sales by sugar content. Demographic trends from AC Nielsen surveys were shown as per cent households purchasing beverages and as volume share by age and sex. Results:  Total volume sales of WBBs increased by 13 % from 1997 to 2006, largely accounted for by increases in sales of plain still water and <b>non-sugar</b> carbonated soft drink (CSD). Sales in the CSD category saw a shift away from sugar-sweetened to <b>non-sugar.</b> There was a concomitant increase in sales of sugar-sweetened sports and energy drinks, and iced tea.

As stronger Lewis acids, the alkaline earth metal ions (Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺) are more effective than the alkali metal ions (Na⁺ and K⁺) to catalyze the dehydration reactions of sugar structures, leading to the formation of more cross-linked cellulose for the alkaline earth metal chloride-loaded celluloses.
