5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; the <b>next</b> <b>logical</b> <b>step</b> was to build a telescope that could look at {{all parts of the}} sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in April 1943, Mussolini had begged Hitler {{to make a}} {{separate}} peace with Stalin and send German troops to the west to guard against an expected Allied invasion of Italy.

Within {{a few days of}} the Allied landings on Sicily in July 1943, it was obvious Mussolini's army was on the brink of collapse. This led Hitler to summon Mussolini to a meeting in Feltre on 19 July 1943. By this time, Mussolini was so shaken from stress that he could no longer stand Hitler's boasting. His mood darkened further when that same day, the Allies bombed Rome—the first time that city had ever been the target of enemy bombing.|$|E

We then define use cases, intending to test a prototype on both camp creators and campers looking to join an existing camp. We then look at usability and prototyping, before asking intended users to thinkaloud.

25|$|Although these {{bandages}} were {{an improvement}} over Larrey’s method, they were far from ideal. They required {{a long time to}} apply and dry and there was often shrinkage and distortion. A great deal of interest had been aroused in Europe around 1800 by a British diplomat, consul William Eton, who described a method of treating fractures that he had observed in Turkey. He noted that gypsum plaster (plaster of Paris) was moulded around the patient’s leg to cause immobilization. If the cast became loose due to atrophy or a reduction in swelling, then additional gypsum plaster was added to fill the space. Adapting the use of plaster of Paris for use in hospitals, however, took some time. In 1828, doctors in Berlin were treating leg fractures by aligning the bones in a long narrow box which was then filled with moist sand. The substitution of plaster of Paris for the sand was the <b>next</b> <b>logical</b> <b>step.</b> Such plaster casts did not succeed however as the patient was confined to bed due to the casts being heavy and cumbersome.|$|E

30|$|ADCs or armed {{antibodies}} represent {{one of the}} <b>next</b> <b>logical</b> <b>steps</b> in {{the implementation}} of smarter, more efficient targeted drugs. Specific delivery of highly bioactive compounds to intracellular targets via antibody-receptor binding and internalization holds promise for the arrival of novel hybrid biologics with improved therapeutic windows. There are currently 2 ADCs approved in the USA (Garnock-Jones, 2013; Lambert and Chari, 2014) for oncological applications and more than 40 ADCs currently in various stages of clinical trials (Polakis, 2016; Sievers and Senter, 2013). It is recognized that there are additional challenges and complexities associated with the design and manufacturing of bio-conjugates versus standard antibodies or small molecules production. The CMC development that made possible the production of heterogeneous ADCs for successful clinical applications marks a cornerstone in biotechnology applications (Beck and Reichert, 2014). Furthermore, as improvements in the technology or novel approaches become available, we can expect additional ADCs with better overall pharmacological properties and safer profiles. The right balance needs to be engineered in the ADC so that the linker and drug are stable in blood but are promptly sorted via antibody binding and internalization to the lysosomal compartment for efficient drug release directed towards intracellular targets.|$|R

The remarks {{of this paper}} are intended to supplement, rather than supplant, those of Brother Alfred. is proposed herein. Another system of ordering We shall obtain aganeral Fibonacci sequence by taking any two integers, a and b, and employing the relationship a + b « c. Utilizing the set of integers for indexing, with a = T and b = T-, and requiring that T T n + 2, (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, •••). Thus, while any two successive terms of a general Fibonacci sequence are sufficient to define the entire sequence, we should like to employ T 0 and Tj.

In the last 5 yr the switchgrass research community has produced a genetic linkage map, an expressed sequence tag (EST) database, a set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that are distributed across the 18 linkage groups, 4 x sampling of the AP 13 genome in 400 -bp reads, and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries containing over 200, 000 clones. These studies have revealed close collinearity of the switchgrass genome with those of sorghum [(L.) Moench], rice (L.), and (L.) P. Beauv.
