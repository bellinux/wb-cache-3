5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavators}} {{found an}} iron object under the skeleton's vertebrae and speculated {{it might be}} an arrowhead {{that had been embedded}} in its back. An X-ray analysis showed it was a nail, probably of Romano-British date, that by chance had been in the ground immediately under the grave or was in soil disturbed when it was dug and had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|E

5|$|In a deleted scene set {{after the}} end of the episode, Walter talks with the first patient Joseph Slater, who wonders why he was chosen to have a piece of Walter's brain. Walter {{responds}} it was a matter of circumstance, as Slater shared his blood type and had a young resilient brain. Walter also says he himself cannot be cured, as his madness had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> missing parts of his brain.|$|E
5|$|Parker and Stone {{were very}} happy with the episode, but {{received}} feedback from fans {{that it was one of}} the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant. Many fans also did not like Kenny's tether ball accident death scene because it had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plot of the episode, which Parker and Stone said was supposed to be the joke.|$|E

Her mother later said that the incident prompted Yeomans to tell her family, [...] "It is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you Daddy, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you Mummy, and <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you Sarah (her sister).

5|$|Due {{to files}} {{recovered}} by Fisher in London (and made public by the president), the American public and Congress both believe that Iran is funding the Blacklist, and The United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Blacklist, {{and that the}} files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United States into a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone {{to blow up the}} Iranian vehicles chasing him, causing an international incident.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Luna's death, {{confusion}} reigned on both sides. The Americans {{even thought}} Luna {{had taken over}} to replace Aguinaldo. Luna's death was publicly declared only by 8 June, and a circular providing details of the event released by 13 June. While investigations were supposedly made concerning Luna's death, not one person was convicted. Later, General Pantaleon García {{said that it was}} he who was verbally ordered by Aguinaldo to conduct the assassination of Luna at Cabanatuan. His sickness at the time prevented his participation in the assassination. Aguinaldo would be firm in his stand that he had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> assassination of Luna.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially wanted <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bill, and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted {{management of the}} bill to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause {{the defeat of the}} bill. To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted the bill through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from the bill (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E

5|$|On November 30, 2011, Gumby Comics/Wildcard Ink {{published}} a single volume collecting Adams' previous two specials featuring Gumby. The book was initially called Gumby's Arthur Adams Specials, but was eventually published with a sticker covering Adams' {{name on the}} cover, effectively renaming the book Gumby's Spring Specials. According to Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool, this was done on Adams' request, who wanted <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> publisher, and took action to keep his name off the book's cover. The book is nonetheless sold by merchants such as Mile High Comics under its originally intended name.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the termination, {{the stock}} price of Braathens {{increased}} by 16%, while SAS's increased 3%. Immediately following the bankruptcy, the two airlines increased their prices. Subsequently, Braathens increased their ticket price by 15%, but stated that this had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> elimination of competition, since the price increase was not on any Oslo routes. In November, Braathens started to remove routes, and announced they would increase prices by 20%. They also reintroduced the Flag of Norway on the tailplane that since the rebranding had been replaced by a silver, abstract wing. Both Braathens and SAS lost more than NOK1 billion in 1999, and the total cost of the price war between the three airlines exceeded NOK 3 billion.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{an update}} to the SEOC Act, the Child Protection Act of 1984, made {{it illegal to}} {{purchase}} pornographic materials depicting minors through the mail, or possess them, {{on the grounds that}} it encouraged child sexual abuse. While popular with voters, civil liberties advocates warned that the expanded scope of these laws could result in prosecutions of entirely innocent people who had little or <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> child-porn industry, such as parents taking photos or videos of their children in the nude. Nevertheless, investigators forged ahead and had, by the mid-1980s, shut down almost all domestic child-porn production. The government itself was thereafter the biggest marketer, in the form of materials it created to tempt buyers.|$|E

5|$|The Zurich council {{decided that}} no {{compromise}} was possible. On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious mandate {{that no one}} shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death. Although Zwingli, technically, had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mandate, {{there is no indication}} that he disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Zurich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the Limmat. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Zurich.|$|E
5|$|Cotto faced WBC, The Ring and lineal middleweight {{champion}} Sergio Martinez for {{the titles}} on June 7, 2014 {{in his first}} fight in the middleweight division at Madison Square Garden. It {{should be noted that}} Martinez was inactive for a year before this bout and had two separate surgeries performed on his right knee. Throughout the fight, journalists and fans alike, noticed Martinez was unable to bend, flex and support his own weight while moving in the ring. Martinez himself proclaimed that his knee had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the fight and his struggles were a result of a body shot. Cotto knocked Martinez down 3 times in the first round and once in the ninth round before Martinez retired on his stool before the tenth round, giving Cotto the win by ninth-round corner retirement. With the win, Cotto became the first Puerto Rican boxer to win world titles in four different weight classes.|$|E
5|$|Florida's {{consideration}} {{of a bill}} to compensate victims of racial violence was the first by any U.S. state. Opponents argued that the bill set a dangerous precedent and put the onus of paying survivors and descendants on Floridians who had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> incident in Rosewood. James Peters, who represented the State of Florida, argued that {{the statute of limitations}} applied because the law enforcement officials named in the lawsuit—Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee—had died many years before. He also called into question the shortcomings of the report: although the historians were instructed not to write it with compensation in mind, they offered conclusions about the actions of Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee. The report was based on investigations led by historians as opposed to legal experts; they relied in cases on information that was hearsay from witnesses who had since died. Critics thought that some of the report's writers asked leading questions in their interviews.|$|E

5|$|Hindley was not arrested with Brady, but {{she demanded}} {{to go with}} him to the police station, {{accompanied}} by her dog, Puppet, to which the police agreed. Hindley was questioned about the events surrounding Evans's death, but she refused to make any statement beyond claiming that it had been an accident. As the police had no evidence that Hindley was involved in Evans's murder, she was allowed to go home, on the condition that she return the next day for further questioning. Hindley was at liberty for four days following Brady's arrest, during which time she went to her employer's premises and asked to be dismissed, so that she would be eligible for unemployment benefits. While in the office where Brady worked, she found some papers belonging to him in an envelope that she claimed she did not open, which she burned in an ashtray. She believed that they were plans for bank robberies, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> murders. On 11 October, Hindley was charged as an accessory to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at Risley.|$|E
5|$|Luftflotte 2 {{was well}} {{used in this}} way. Operations against Kenley, Biggin Hill, North Weald and Hornchurch had the {{potential}} to destroy 11 Group's major sector stations and impair its defences. It would also draw the defending fighters into battle. The attempt to attack Kenley, however, failed and 9 Staffel KG 76 paid a high price. The weather prevented any chance of the raids on Hornchurch and North Weald being successful. On the other hand, Luftflotte 3 had poor intelligence, and its raids on the radar stations were ineffective. Radar elimination would enable the Luftwaffe to destroy the command and control system of Fighter Command, but despite the severe damage done to the Poling station, the existence of other stations nearby gave the system plenty of cover. The airfields the Air Fleet attacked at Ford, Gosport and Thorney Island had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> main battle as they belonged to Coastal Command and the FAA. Sperrle and his command remained unaware of their errors in intelligence.|$|E
