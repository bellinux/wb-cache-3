50|$|In Heil v. Rankin a {{specially}} constituted Court of Appeal resolved eight test cases {{by creating a}} formula for increasing the measure of damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity. In this respect, the case only affects {{a small number of}} personal injury claims which involve serious injury; and secondly, even in the most extreme of these cases, it increases damages by only modest amounts of up to one third. Lewis and others have long argued that a no-fault approach to compensation would be more appropriate. The Heil case simply reinforces the tort system for the award of damages (in January 1996 the Law Commission had published a Consultation Paper (No. 140) Damages for Personal Injury: <b>Non-Pecuniary</b> <b>Loss,</b> followed by Commission Report No. 257).|$|E

He resigned in March 2001 after a prolonged campaign of harassment by a colleague and line manager. An employment tribunal upheld his complaint of unfair dismissal and made a compensatory award, under section 123 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. This included a sum of £10,000 for the distress suffered for the manner of his dismissal. The employer successfully appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal {{on the ground that}} the employment tribunal had had no jurisdiction to make an award of compensation for non-economic loss on a complaint of unfair dismissal.

40|$|Damages for {{personal}} injury The diploma thesis {{focuses on the}} analysis and evaluation of the recodified legal regulation on damages for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> arising from personal injury {{in the light of}} its comparison with the relevant English common law. On the background of the historical evolution of the method for assessing the amount of damages for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> arising from personal injury, as well as through the comparison of Metodika Nejvyššího soudu k náhradě nemajetkové újmy při ublížení na zdraví (bolest a ztížení společenského uplatnění podle § 2958 občanského zákoníku) with Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases, the diploma thesis arrives at a conclusion in favour of the development and application of the former, which it deems to have been a suitably chosen pre-emptive measure that would allow Czech legal practice to approach damages for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> arising from personal injury in a consistent and proportionate fashion right from the moment of the coming into effect of Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., the Civil Code, without having to overcome a period of relative legal uncertainty, during which standardised amounts of damages would have been developed through judicial practice, {{as was the case in}} the English common law.

40|$|Prior {{to changes}} in the Western Australian {{legislation}} in 1993 an injured worker could sue his or her employer for damages at common law irrespective of the seriousness of injury or size of damages. A common law action is conditional on the personal injury being sustained during the course of employment, and caused by the negligence or breach of statutory duty of the employer. In recent years there has been concern expressed about the efficacy of the common law process in providing injured workers with awards that match their pecuniary and <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>losses.</b> We address this issue by developing a model of the determination of common law awards in which we assume pre-trial settlement. We find that the economic mechanisms which bring plaintiff and defendant to a pre-trial settlement will not necessarily produce an award settlement consistent with the size of pecuniary and <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>losses.</b> The model is subjected to an empirical examination using a sample of 384 plaintiffs whose cases were closed in Western Australia in 1990. Our results indicate that in practice the common law process fails to determine an individual assessment of injured workers' losses. In particular, awards represent an inadequate compensation for the losses suffered by severely incapacitated plaintiffs.

40|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 19 th century, the claim for an effective protection of personality has been increasing in the area of civil law. Recently the legislation of the European Union is beginning to cover civil law relations. Although the way to a common European civil law is in far distance, but there were attempts to find a common ground in tort law. One of the youngest civil codes in Europe is the Dutch BW, which came into force in 1992 and contains most of the achievements of common European legal resources. Damages for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> are a really problematic field of tort law because one of the essential lemmas of compensation ? damage itself ? is non-interpretable. This study shows how the legislation deal with damages for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss,</b> this strange civil law institution, and how the jurisdiction reacted on the provisions of statutory law. Dutch Civil Code contains only general rules and gives the power to the hand of judges to adjudge damages for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> as they consider it from case to case. The only unsolved problem is in connection with the status of third parties or secondary victims, who have no right to claim for damages unless they demonstrate that they suffered such a psychical trauma, which makes them the primary victim of the injury. It is seen for the future of common European tort law that the only good solution to describe damages for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> is a very flexible statutory law, which gives enough space for courts to develop legal practice by the side of typical cases. In continental legal systems it is a big dilemma, because legislators do not want to give too much power to their judges, afraid of overturning the balance of powers. Without this confidence {{it is almost impossible to}} create acceptable solution to protect personality with civil law instrument...|$|E
40|$|In {{a remarkably}} frank paper, Professor Andrew Burrows has {{shed some light}} on the process by which awards for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> in {{personal}} injury cases were uplifted in Heil v Rankin, a process in which he played a leading role as a Law Commissioner. In apparent disregard of the criticisms to which this process has been subjected, Burrows regards it {{as an example of a}} valuable ‘methodology’ of common law law reform. These criticisms are reviewed in this paper and to them is added a criticism of the concept of ‘normal decision-making’ by the courts that is the basis of Burrows’ views. Heil v Rankin was far from normal decision-making, but in this it was merely of a piece with all awards of damages for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss,</b> for such damages have no grounding in the common law adjudication of awards of compensation. The further development in Simmons v Castle of the judicial legislation effected in Heil v Rankin is also considered...|$|E

In this article, I begin by defining the know-how contracts and in particular I will analyze the main obligations of the parties. Secondly, I will deal with the definition and the legal nature of know-how, since considerable uncertainty exists as to the degree or type of protection regarding the legal nature of know-how. There are different opinions put forward, which defines the legal nature of know-how as a property, an intangible asset, a monopoly of fact and a personality right. Finally, and on the basis of the conclusion reached under the previous section, I will discuss whether it is possible for know-how provider to claim damages for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the correct magnitude {{of pain and}} suffering damages for personal injuries. These damages differ greatly between and within countries, and the law of damages {{does not provide a}} framework to assess the correctness of the granted amounts. In our view, Law and Economics in combination with Health Economics is able to provide the required external framework. In the Law and Economics literature, a tension exists between the prevention theory (stating that the injurer should fully compensate <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>losses)</b> and the insurance theory (stat-ing that the victim should not receive compensation for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>losses,</b> because he would not self-insure against these losses). We discuss the scarce literature that suggests a synthesis between these two theories: by basing damages on the amount that victims would spend {{in order to reduce the}} expected <b>non-pecuniary</b> accident <b>losses,</b> the injurer receives the correct incentives and the victim is not over-compensated. The Law and Economics litera-ture, however, lacks a framework to connect the magnitude of the damages to the injuries of the victim. The concept of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) from the domain of Health Economics can fill this gap. A QALY expresses the value of living one year in a certain health condition. By studying Health Economics literature, the impact of different health conditions on the quality of life may be assessed. By subsequently monetizing QALYs, this impact is expressed in monetary terms, thereby providing a non-arbitrary basis for pain and suffering damages. We compare the amounts granted in pain and suffering damages in several European coun-tries with the amounts that would result from a conservative estimation of the monetary value of a QALY for specific types of personal injuries. The conclusion is that the amounts that are currently awarded are (much) too low from a perspective of deterrence, but also from the more traditional legal compensation point of view...|$|R
30|$|This section summarises {{the main}} {{research}} about school dropout distinguishing four main lines. First, some papers investigate the gains from additional schooling and use new compulsory school laws as instruments {{to estimate the}} counterfactual for students that would otherwise have left sooner (Angrist and Krueger (1991) and Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) for the US; Harmon and Walker (1995) for the UK; Oreopoulos (2007) for the US, UK, and Canada; Brunello and Rocco (2010) for the European Countries). Overall, they find that compulsion school raises earnings to individuals that otherwise would be dropouts. Other studies find <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> of school dropout such as committing crime or ending up in jail (Lochner and Moretti (2004)) and higher mortality (Lleras-Muney (2002)). For the Spanish case, Felfe et al. (2012) study the effect of extending universal compulsory schooling to age 3 (also introduced by the LOGSE) on childen’s cognitive development. They find sizeable effects on reading skills and weak evidence of a reduction in grade retention.|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper we {{have argued that}} tort law can benefit {{from the use of}} Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in assessing pain and suffering damages for personal injuries. In the current paper we pose that QALYs may be able to solve a problem which exists in the economic analysis of this area of law. The question whether a tortfeasor should compensate <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> is not answered unambiguously in Law and Economics, as shows from the debate between the prevention theory (which argues that the injurer should be liable for immaterial losses) and the insurance theory (which argues that the victim should not receive compensation for such losses). In our view, QALYs are able {{to bridge the gap between}} these two theories. They provide a framework for the assessment of pain and suffering damages for personal injuries, which is based on the impact of the health impairment on the victim. This is important for the (primarily legal) objective to provide adequate compensation to the tort victim, and for the (primarily Law and Economics) goal to provide adequate deterrent incentives. A QALY expresses the value of living one year in a certain health condition. Healt...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{topic of}} this thesis {{is the issue}} of personal rights protection, specifically the protection of personal rights in connection with an occupational injury. My interest in the topic stems from the discrepancy between the statutory damages that may be awarded for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> under the applicable provisions of Act 40 / 1964 Sb., Civil Code, as amended 1 (Civil Code) and the damages customarily awarded by Czech courts, which often substantially overstep the boundaries prescribed by the legislature. The Czech courts frequently ascribe to the view, particularly in cases involving a <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> caused by occupational injuries (even where caused by negligence), that the statutory damages, that is damages stipulated by the Civil Code 2 and by the implementing regulation, do not represent an adequate compensation; as a consequence, the courts in this jurisdiction tend to append to the statutory damages for a single injury or loss of health claim an additional compensation that derives its statutory justification from the provisions of law enacted with a completely different original intent. Unlike the purely theoretical treatises, this thesis incorporates an extensive case-study based on my comprehensive personal experience in this area that reveals some of the possible pitfalls of personal [...] ...|$|E

40|$|As it is {{apparent}} from its title, the overall {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the theoretical conception of just satisfaction. Satisfaction is a type remedy which is being awarded for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss,</b> i. e. for loss on all rights other than those which a person can own or translate. In this work I look at (1) basic categories of the conception of just satisfaction and (2) on their mutual relation.

This study is divided into nine chapters. First I look at linguistic and juristic meaning of the notion satisfaction (chapter 2 and 3). Then, I delve into the system of delictual liability and the role of just satisfaction in this system. Here I also use a comparative method of research. In this system I ask on the relation between negligence and strict liability. In the same, third chapter I look for and analyse basic characteristics of just satisfaction in relation to damages. This brings me to more basic question on the elementary conditions from which the remedy in question and also damages in general can arise. Thus in the fourth, longest [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{rationales}} {{behind and}} the effectiveness of the compensation for pecuniary and <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> in Hong Kong’s personal injury disputes will be examined in this project. Special consideration will be given to the assessment of damages for pain, suffering and loss of amenity (“PSLA”). On the other hand, the potential use of structured settlements or periodical payment orders (“PPO”) as a substitute for (or together with) lump-sum awards will also be examined. The primary sources of data comprise all judgments on personal injury issued by the Hong Kong Judiciary during 1976 - 2016. PSLA involves converting pain into dollars, which is not a process of mathematical measurement. It involves sound judgment and principled discretion guided by moral norms. For the purpose of constructing a coherent and logical framework, the statistical relationship between PSLA awards and other relevant factors, such as medical expenses, will be examined. In catastrophic personal injury cases, the lump-sum awards hinge on estimates of the claimants’ life expectancy and investment returns over inflation. However, claimants may exhaust their funds by surviving longer than their projected life expectancy, or due to lower-than-expected investment returns. PPO provide for regular payments over their lifetime, which are adjusted annually based on an inflation index. In this project, reforms focusing on PSLA and the use of PPO will be recommended...|$|R

Although the Malaysian government has enacted laws and formulated policies to govern the housing industry since it achieved Independence in 1957, abandoned housing projects still remains a recurrent problem until today.

The purchasers also may face other <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>losses</b> and sufferings, to their chagrin, such as dismissal from employment, divorces, troubles, anxiety, mental pressure, distress, personal problems leading to chaotic and miserable health and lives. There are certain legal and equitable remedies provided by the housing law particularly the I lousing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966 and its regulations (Act 1 IS), the terms and conditions in the statutory sale and purchase agreements signed by the developers and the purchasers and the law emanated through case law in court. These legal and equitable remedies include specific performance, declaratory order, rescission of contract and damages. Nonetheless these remedies may not obtainable if the housing developers have no monetary at all or that they run away out of jurisdiction or that the abandoned housing projects are too complicated and troublesome. Further there are other grievances that cannot be compensated or dealt with by the Malaysian current laws such as pain, anxiety, distress and humiliation that have been befalling the aggrieved purchasers in abandoned housing projects.

50|$|In {{contract}} cases, {{the court}} is usually interested in securing the performance of what was agreed. Where one party is about to or has suffered loss {{as a result of}} the other's breach, the court offers practical protection to his or her expectations as to performance (in some cases, the use of injunction or specific performance may be appropriate). Where a party proves that he or she has sustained loss flowing from any breach (potentially including <b>non-pecuniary</b> or intangible <b>losses,</b> e.g. for disappointment, damage to reputation, etc.), the purpose of damages is, so far as money can do it, to place the claimant in the same situation as if the contract had been performed. Thus, the most relevant basis upon which to calculate any loss is to examine the economic potential of the contract as worded. This will provide a measure of what the claimant expected to gain, and so quantify what has been lost by the breach.|$|R
40|$|Prescription drug {{coverage}} {{is a central}} issue in the policy debate over Medicare reform. Proponents of a Medicare drug benefit have argued that {{drug coverage}} increases use of essential medicines, which may increase {{quality of life and}} offset related non-drug medical spending by reducing the risk of hospitalization and nursing home stays. Evidence on {{the costs and benefits of}} expanding drug coverage remains limited. This study examines the impact of insurance coverage for prescription drugs on medical spending and functional disability in the elderly Medicare population. ^ Most elderly Medicare beneficiaries have one or more chronic conditions that often require long-term compliance with prescription drug therapy. Thus, understanding the implications of drug coverage motivates a theoretical model of how chronic illness affects the demand for medical care. Chronic illness usually implies a permanent, degenerative condition with <b>non-pecuniary</b> disability <b>loss.</b> The key characteristic of chronic illness is endogenous severity: the risk of complications and decline in functional status may be influenced by the consumer 2 ̆ 7 s choice of the level of preventive effort. In the case of prescription drugs, insurance coverage lowers the marginal cost of drugs which induces greater drug utilization and use of more costly drugs. The potential benefits are a reduction in non-drug medical spending and lower level of functional disability. ^ Using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, the effect of drug coverage on drug spending, non-drug spending, and functional disability is estimated for elderly Medicare beneficiaries continuously enrolled in supplemental insurance from employers, Medigap, and Medicare HMOs. Drug coverage is specified as an endogenous treatment effect, and selection bias is addressed using propensity score matching and selection models. ^ The study finds that drug coverage increases the probability of any prescription and aggregate drug spending. Moral hazard induces a greater number of prescriptions filled as well as a higher average cost per prescription. Although no conclusive evidence of a cost-offset to aggregate non-drug medical spending was found, some savings to acute medical care are suggested. Drug coverage may increase spending on ambulatory medical care. Some evidence of a link between drug coverage and declining disability was found. ...|$|R
40|$|European {{human rights}} law is {{superior}} to the national laws of damages. The case law of the European Court of Human Rights now provides a sufficient reason for national lawmakers to rethink their concept of non-pecuniary damage. The fact remains that the ECtHR in its case law finds a breach of a fundamental right and remedies that breach, whereas the national law of damages affords the possibility of awarding compensation for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> if the aggrieved party is injured. A conflict results: on the European level a rights-based approach is applied, and {{on the national level}} a damage/injury-based approach prevails. In this article we advocate a change in the national law of damages {{in order to ensure that}} the law of damages remains durable and consistent when confronted with judgments of the ECtHR: we advocate accepting and incorporating a rights-based approach. The clash between European human rights law and the national law of damages is clearly expressed in the different approaches regarding bereavement damage. Under Dutch law a proposal aimed at introducing a legal basis for compensation for this type of loss was rejected a few years ago, whereas the ECtHR, starting from its rights-based approach, has found that compensation for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> should be available as part of the range of redress mechanisms when a government body has infringed a family member’s right to life. An specific argument in the Dutch discussion, i. e. the moral aversion towards compensating and determining grief and suffering, can be overcome by not making a link with grief and suffering but instead taking one’s legal position as a starting point, e. g. the breach of the right to life. A rights-based approach not only supports the idea that any rights infringed should be remedied, but also implies a moral dismissal...|$|E

40|$|To {{the great}} dissatisfaction of many {{personal}} injury lawyers, in 2010 the Dutch Upper Chamber (Eerste Kamer) rejected a legislative proposal on <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> {{caused by the}} death of a loved one, i. e. bereavement damage (so-called affectieschade or Angehörigenscherzensgeld). 1 The proposal aimed to introduce a legal basis for compensating bereavement damage, i. e. damages for the next of kin’s non-pecuniary loss: (mere) grief. Until now, the close relatives of victims have no basis for claiming compensation for bereavement damage in the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek). A few months after the rejection of the proposal Wijnakker stated that a limited group of next of kin can already find a legal basis in the European Convention on Human Rights (hereinafter: ECHR). She thereby drew attention to judgements of the European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter: ECtHR or the Court) in Dutch private law literature. 2 Close relatives, under certain circumstances, find protection in Article 2 in conjunction with Article 13 ECHR as the Court has decided that compensation for nonpecuniary damage should be available as part of the range of redress {{in the case of a}} breach of Article 2 ECHR. 3 Under Dutch law, according to Article 94 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Grondwet), statutory provisions should not be applied if those provisions conflict with provisions of treaties by international institutions that are binding on all persons. 4 When confronted with a claim for compensation for bereavement damage, and the defendant is a government body, a judge should not apply the law of damages as far as this law excludes the awarding of damages for mere grief. The judgements of the European Court of Human Rights thus shed new light on the discussion regarding bereavement damage in the Netherlands. Considering the above, the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights affects the (originally: private) law of damages. Additionally, the Court does not restrict itself to awarding damages for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> in cases concerning bereavement damage. The Court awards damages for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> in other cases as well, after having ruled that a Convention right has been infringed. It does not however affect the whole range of the law of damages, as the working sphere of the ECHR is restricted and only deals with the protection of the core values that are protected by the rights in the Convention. The Court is furthermore more reluctant to rule on the tenability of private law provisions than on the tenability of acts and regulations in the public law domain. 5 On a national level judges are thus confronted with the case law of the Court that concerns acts or omissions by public authorities. In other words, the judgements of the ECtHR are not rendered between private parties, and the national law of damages, as far as it is applied between private parties, is therefore not affected. National courts, as a consequence, are confronted with two different concepts of damage. An illustration of this difference is the position of next of kin in wrongful death cases. In light of this, the main question to be answered is how the national law of damages could and should be adjusted to remain durable and consistent when confronted with judgements of the ECtHR. We illustrate the need for adjustment by focussing on the next of kin’s <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> under Dutch law, because this topic is, at least in Dutch literature, the most controversial and is still under discussion. A distinction will be made between the traditional discussion on awarding damages for bereavement damage in Dutch literature, on the one hand, and the Court’s decisions on the enforcement of the next of kin’s right to life under Article 2 ECHR, on the other, thereby explaining the different approaches of both sets of regulations, and additionally questioning the current reluctance to interweave both the law of damages and the idea of the enforcement of fundamental rights. We thereby also pay attention to German law to illustrate that the clash between the national law of damages and European human rights law is not solely a ‘Dutch’ problem, but that other Member States deal with the same issue as well. Additionally, German law in particular is interesting because it is also one of the few European systems in which bereavement damage is not a legally relevant damage. Furthermore, the idea of compensation for infringements of the general right of personality (allgemeine Persönlichkeitsrecht) in German law is a legal concept that seems interesting to analyse in the context of the idea of the vindication or enforcement of fundamental rights on the level of the ECHR...|$|E
40|$|This book {{provides}} invaluable {{assistance to}} all those facing coursework assignments or examinations in contract law. It provides the student with an easy method of identifying all the main points in a particular area, whilst teaching by illustration {{the skills needed to}} write good answers to contract questions. The questions and answers cover all the main areas dealt with in undergraduate and PGDL contract courses. This edition, which contains several completely new questions, has been fully revised to take account of recent developments. The most important of these are the House of Lords decisions in Royal Bank of Scotland v Etridge (No 2) (2001) (undue influence) and Farley v Skinner (2001) (damages for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss),</b> and the Court of Appeal decision in Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd (2002) (mistake). In the area of contract formation, the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 and the European Directive on Electronic Commerce 2000 are both fully covered, and the developing area of contracting over the internet is dealt with in detail...|$|E
40|$|The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (Cap 52 A, 2003 Rev Ed, Sing) {{attempts}} to protect consumers through compensatory damages. This article argues that compensatory damages {{are not enough}} to adequately protect consumers and deter consumer victimisation {{on the part of}} businesses. The article first sets out relevant provisions in the statute with regard to damages. Second, the article analyses the regime of damages in relation to other legislation in Canada and Australia from which it has been adapted and looks at how the damages provisions have been interpreted so far. Third, the article considers the types of damages available under the statute and how they may be interpreted by the courts, including pecuniary loss, <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss,</b> the limits of compensatory damages and non-compensatory damages. Finally, the article argues that Parliament, in leaving out exemplary damages under the statute, has weakened its effectiveness in deterring unfair practices aimed at consumers. The authors therefore recommend that Parliament should consider explicitly including exemplary damages in the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act to ensure that the regime effectively deters unfair practices...|$|E
40|$|The Road Accident Fund Amendment Act 19 of 2005 {{came into}} effect on 1 August 2008. This Act limits the Road Accident Fund’s {{liability}} for compensation {{in respect of}} claims for <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss</b> to instances where a “serious injury” has been sustained. A medical practitioner has {{to determine whether or}} not the claimant has suffered a serious injury by undertaking an assessment prescribed in the Regulations to the Act. The practitioner has to complete a RAF 4 report. In doing so the practitioner must assess the injury in terms of the American Medical Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (6 th ed). If the injury is considered to have resulted in less than 30 per cent of the whole person impairment the medical practitioner should apply the narrative test. The article focuses on the narrative test but also discusses reasons why the regulations do not fulfil the requirements of the Act; reasons why the Guides is not adequate to the task; the impact of the circumstances of an injured person on disability; problems with the existing wording of the narrative test; shortcomings on the RAf 4 form; the administrative process as well as the appeal tribunals...|$|E
40|$|This article aims {{to point}} out that some of the figures {{recurring}} in the debate on extracontractual liability are indeed unable to sustain a serious screening under the categories of tortious liability. Pure economic loss is the typical contractual damage and is alien to systems like the Italian one which, providing in art. 2043 c. c. that damage has to be “ingiusto”, contradicts a loss being purely economic. The same is to be said about the loss of chance, which paradoxically is the result of what as a damage is purely economic then not “ingiusto”, at the level of causation lacks of a link properly intended, and as a loss is uncertain. Punitive damages are the fruit of a common law (the American particularly) still inclined to consider civil liability a place for the score settling and the vengeance, even though new theories try to credit them in new perspectives. Finally the “danno esistenziale” is a fairly new Italian figure of non patrimonial damage which has contributed to muddle things up, whereas what is intended by this label already finds compensation through “danno biologico” and <b>non-pecuniary</b> <b>loss,</b> the two parts in which non patrimonial damage still divides...|$|E
