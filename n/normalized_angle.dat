40|$|Automatic {{processing}} of bank checks is a challenging research {{topic in the}} field of document analysis and recognition. Bank check processing is the process of automatic segmentation and recognition of the different data fields present on the bank check. In this process, the user entered handwritten information is automatically extracted from the check and recognized by a computer. Authentication is performed by comparing the handwritten signatures with the reference samples provided by the user. For the purpose of check processing, we have proposed a generic method for the automatic segmentation and identification of the information fields on a bank check. The uniqueness of this approach {{lies in the fact that}} it doesnt necessitate any prior information about the layout of the check and requires minimum human intervention. The various fields are segmented on the basis of their connectivity. Recognition of the fields is achieved based on the four newly devised fuzzy features, namely, average response, entropy, energy and quotient response. In addition to the proposed fuzzy features, Zernike moments have also been explored. A simple fuzzy logic based recognition approach is used to identify the various fields. The fuzzy features are able to identify all fields with reasonable accuracy but Zernike moments are found to distinguish the written matter from the printed matter only; hence these are used for coarse classification only. Automatic verification of handwritten signatures is fundamental to the authentication of bank checks. This thesis presents two approaches for handwritten signature verification using two different sets of features. In the first approach, additive fuzzy modeling has been employed to track the intrinsic variations in signatures samples of an individual for the twin purposes of signature verification and forgery detection. Innovative <b>normalized</b> <b>angle</b> features that uniquely characterize a signature are extracted by constructing a special grid which encloses the signature and divides it into ninety six local boxes. These features are then fuzzified by an exponential membership function, which has been modified to include two structural parameters. The structural parameters are devised to deal with innumerable variations in handwriting styles and personal characteristics. The membership functions constitute weights in the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model. The optimization of the output of the TS model with respect to the structural parameters yields their estimated values. Two cases are considered. In the first case, the coefficients of the consequent part of the rule are fixed so as to yield a simple form of TS model and in the second case, the coefficients are adapted. In this formulation, each fuzzy rule is constituted by a single feature and is implemented on the signature database. In the second formulation, only one rule encompassing all the features is considered. Experimental results demonstrate that the simple form of TS model in the first formulation is better than the one with coefficients adapted. In the second approach, edge features based on direction and hinge distribution are extracted from the signatures to create the knowledge base. Signature recognition is then performed using the fuzzy model derived from the Choquet integral. The output function in this model combines the fuzzy measures from input fuzzy sets and the resulting system is called non-additive fuzzy system unlike the output function in TS model where each coefficient corresponds to its own fuzzy set. This system is meant for modelling of the input fuzzy sets that have overlapping information. However, the performance of this system is found to be inferior to that of the additive fuzzy system as it is not able to detect forgeries effectively. To improve its performance, the decision from its model is fused with the decision of the simple TS model and a neural network classifier. Experimental results illustrate that although the fusion of verification algorithms produces better performance than any of the fused methods individually, it is still worse than the first approach using the grid features. Finally, a comparative analysis of well known static signature verification schemes is made on our signature database. The results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods...|$|E
30|$|In Figure 1, the {{optimized}} sum rate {{results are}} shown for the FL when users are uniformly located within cells. First it is noted {{that for all}} schemes, the maximum rates are achieved when the <b>normalized</b> beam <b>angle</b> is less than the nominal one and for both R-ZF and DPC precoding the optimal beam angles are only 30 % of the nominal one. This is because users are randomly located in the cells and it is preferred for satellite antenna feeds to focus on a smaller beam size in order to reduce interference to neighboring cells while users outside the cell can be jointly served by all feeds. As can be seen, when the <b>normalized</b> beam <b>angle</b> is less than the nominal one, more than double rates are achieved by joint beam processing using R-ZF precoding or DPC precoding, compared to conventional single beam processing. Also due to the smaller beam size, interference is not the dominant factor therefore the linear R-ZF precoding performs almost as well as DPC precoding. When the normalized beam size increases, beams become overlapped and achievable rates decrease due to the strong interferences. In this case, DPC clearly shows the advantage of nonlinear interference pre-cancelation over the linear R-ZF precoding.|$|R
40|$|Orientational {{preferences}} between interacting helices within globular proteins {{have been}} studied extensively over the years. A number of classical structural models such as “knobs into holes” and “ridges into grooves” were developed decades ago to explain perceived preferences in interhelical angle distributions. In contrast, relatively recent works have examined statistical biases in angular distributions which result from spherical geometric effects. Those works {{have concluded that the}} predictions of classical models are {{due in large part to}} these biases. In this article we perform an analysis on the largest set of helix-helix interactions within high-resolution structures of nonhomologous proteins studied to date. We examine the interhelical angle distribution as a function of spatial distance between helix pairs. We show that previous efforts to <b>normalize</b> <b>angle</b> distribution data did not include two important effects: 1), helices can interact with each other in three distinct ways which we refer to as “line-on-line,” “endpoint-to-line,” and “endpoint-to-endpoint,” and each of these interactions has its own geometric effects which must be included in the proper normalization of data; and 2), all normalizations that depend on geometric parameters such as interhelical angle must occur before the data is binned to avoid artifacts of bin size from biasing the conclusions. Taking these two points into account, we find that there are very pronounced preferences for helices to interact at angles of approximately ± 160 and ± 20 ° in the line-on-line case. This pattern persists when the closest α-carbons in the helices vary from 4 to 12 Å. The endpoint-to-line and endpoint-to-endpoint cases also exhibit distinct preferences when the data is normalized properly. Analysis of the local structural interactions which give rise to these preferences has not been studied here and is left for future work...|$|R

40|$|Background: Left {{ventricular}} (LV) {{torsion angle}} {{is a key}} parameter of cardiac performance but is difficult to measure. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe a noninvasive imaging method for the assessment of these complex cardiac motions. Objectives: In this study, left ventricular torsion <b>angle</b> and <b>normalized</b> torsion <b>angle</b> were estimated in the short axis view for healthy persons. Patients and Methods: We acquired basal and apical short axis left ventricular LV images in the short axis view for 14 healthy men to estimate LV torsion angle by echo tracking under a block-matching (BM) algorithm. By extracting the instantaneous changes in total displacement vector in the short axis view throughout a cardiac cycle, we calculated the instantaneous rotation and torsion angles in the short axis view. To account for differences in heart size, normalized torsion was calculated based on the radius of both the apical and basal slices in the end diastolic frame. Results: Apical and basal rotation was measured from short axis images by automatic frame-to-frame tracking of grayscale echo patterns. The vertical and horizontal displacements of the apical level were more than those of the basal level. All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Data was tested for normal distribution and homogeneity of variance by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S) and Levene’s test respectively. The peak rotation angles of the basal and apical levels and LV torsion angle in the short axis view were 8. 0 ± 1. 6 °, 9. 5 ± 1. 8 °, and 17. 3 ± 2. 5 °, respectively. The normalized torsion was calculated as 7. 8 ± 1. 3 °, based on the basal maximum radius, the apical maximum radius, and the distance between the apical and basal levels. Conclusions: We conclude that the <b>normalized</b> torsion <b>angle</b> is an important biomechanical parameter, because it is independent of heart size and distorted geometries in pathological ventricles...|$|R

Attitude control for AOS with a swinging sensor will be highlighted in this paper. Due to the non-negligible mass and length of the sensor, the internal motion between the satellite and the sensor will change the attitude, the position of center of mass and moment of inertia of the SYSTEM (consists of the satellite and the sensor).

Collection of GCF was performed at the mesial and distal sites of both central incisors, for the maxilla and mandible. Growth phase was assessed through the cervical vertebral maturation method. GCF parameters were expressed as total protein content, total ALP activity, and normalized ALP activity. Results: The total GCF protein content was similar between the different growth phases. On the contrary, the total ALP activity showed a peak for the pubertal growth phase. The normalized GCF ALP activity was only poorly associated with growth phase. No differences were seen between the maxillary and mandibular sites, or between the sexes, for any GCF parameter. Conclusions: The total GCF protein content is not sensitive to the growth phase.

The synthesis represents each outline as a regularly resampled data set of radially aligned shape coordinates analogous to bilateral Procrustes shape coordinates. When the center is iteratively located in one particular way, this representation has the same Procrustes distance statistics as a conventional radial representation, while the formalism of shape coordinates permits symmetrization, localizability, and thin-plate spline visualizations. We explain the method and sketch some of its advantages and limitations in the course of an example involving 99 Baculites inornatus outlines spanning 90 m of deposits from a high-precision measured section in the Campanian-age Rosario Formation cropping out at Punta San Jose, Baja California. This sequence shows substantial changes of pole curvature over time, changes that may involve a punctuation event regarding hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, or defense against predators. A concluding comment deals with implications of the developments here for Baculites microevolution and for morphometrics. Fred L. Bookstein and Peter D. War...|$|R
