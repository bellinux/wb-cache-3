The spherical tokamak, which has a very low aspect ratio, is the most promising of the compact magnetic fusion reactor designs. This compactness imposes a severe material constraint on the design, as a highly compact device will have very thin inner shielding. This inner shielding, which in traditional designs is required to be around 1 meter thick, acts to protect the central solenoid and return toroidal field coil legs from material damage and <b>nuclear</b> <b>heating</b> resulting from high neutron fluxes. The use of a sub-meter inner shield creates potential {{for the design of}} a proof of principle magnetic fusion device, sacrificing the central component materials for a demonstration of temporary fusion power production. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>heating</b> of thin shields (~ 0. 1 - 0. 2 m) of various compositions was explored using the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) transport code.

Experimental data is conservatively applied to BWR fuel to ensure that the transition to film boiling does not occur during normal or transient operation. Typical SLMCPR/MCPRSL (Safety Limit MCPR) licensing limit for a BWR core is substantiated by a calculation that proves that 99.9% of fuel rods in a BWR core will not enter the transition to film boiling during normal operation or anticipated operational occurrences.
