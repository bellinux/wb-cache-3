The new energy-efficiency law make provision for a 16 % reduction in energy intensity by 2015 in China. New law in the United States of America requires new fuel-economy standards. European Union law aims for a cut of 20 % in energy demand for the countries forming part of the European Union. Japan, with the country's <b>new</b> <b>energy</b> <b>strategy</b> aims to decrease electricity demand with 10 % by 2030 as stipulated in the <b>new</b> <b>energy</b> <b>strategy.</b> South Arica is currently experiencing a shortage in electricity generating capacity and operates within its reserve margin. The construction of new power stations is in process to address the shortage but Eskom must finance these assets by increasing the electricity tariff. Electricity prices are predicted to double from 2013 to 2017. In addition to the tariff increases, the Energy Conservation Scheme (ECS) is also planned by Eskom whereby all electricity consumers have to reduce their electricity consumption by 10 % or face penalties. Energy efficiency initiatives in South Africa will help meet some of the country's social, economic, and environmental goals. These initiatives are important as they immediately tackle the problem of electricity shortages and are a cost-effective way of increasing available electricity supply. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the need for businesses in the Vaal Triangle to be resource efficient and practice clean production in order to be able to capitalise on that need. With the current knowledge and technology available, Resource Efficiency and Cleaner Production (RECP) will prove to be a future necessity for industry. To determine the perceived readiness towards a green economy contribution is thus of importance. The study did a review on RECP, energy efficiency, supply of energy in South Africa, focus areas for energy efficiency and the benefits thereof. The study discussed energy efficiency incentive schemes and subsidisation funds available in South Africa. The study assessed the primary fields for RECP, the drivers and barriers to RECP and the willingness to participate in RECP initiatives in the Vaal Triangle.

In the last years, the share of Diesel engines in automotive applications reached about 55 % in EU market, thus trying to widen the alternatives to Diesel fuel is very important. In this framework straight vegetable oils (SVO) can represent one of the available possibilities {{at least in some}} specific applications (i. e., public transportation, hybrid or marine propulsion, etc.). SVO properties may be very different form Diesel fuel, thus operating a Diesel engine with SVO might result in some problems, especially in automotive configuration where the electronic unit acts as if it is working with Diesel fuel. This reflects in possible engine power and torque reduction, maintenance problems, and pollutant emissions during vehicles running. The latter aspect is the focus of the present paper. In this work, we used a turbocharged, four stroke, four cylinders, water cooled, common-rail multijet Diesel engine in automotive configuration to simulate the extraurban cycle according to the EU standard, comparing pollutant emissions in case of SVO and gasoil fuelling...|$|E

40|$|Triggered by {{debates on}} climate change and energy security, {{renewable}} energy sources are presently high on the political agenda in many countries. In this regard Russia seems to stand aside worldwide developments. Until recently Russia¿s enormous potential in renewable energy sources remained poorly utilised. However, Russia¿s formal commitment to the global climate change regime, its <b>new</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Strategy</b> 2030, {{and an increase in}} wood pellet production suggest a discontinuity. This paper investigates and explains the (limited) progress in the solid bioenergy sector in Northwest Russia. With little Russian experience in this sector, poor technological knowledge on renewables, and inadequate domestic market structures, the development of a domestic solid bioenergy sector is far from easy. Hence, Northwest Russian wood pellet developments cannot be traced back to new federal policies, only partly to local demand and stimulation, and significantly to foreign drivers. Major EU demand for wood pellets and intensified collaboration with foreign companies and organisations leading in the field of solid bioenergy research, technology and trade have triggered these developments. But it is a long way before Russia will be released from its fossil fuel addiction, as repeatedly promised by governmental officials...|$|E
40|$|The energy {{problem has}} been redefined {{as one of the}} most {{important}} elements of sustainable development by climate change, adaptation and mitigation. Meeting energy needs is always a current issue in Hungary, irrespective of climate change because of the country’s high dependency on oil and gas imports, limited opportunities to replace them with domestic production, and the pollution associated with using fossil energy sources.

40|$|AbstractThe EU <b>new</b> <b>energy</b> <b>strategy</b> {{represents}} a challenge and a boost for industries and researchers pushing {{them to find}} new solutions to supply the energy demand complying with new environmental requests. The transport sector {{is one of the}} most addicted to oil product and then pollutant. A new bio-fuels generation is being studied, but the use of the ones already available should be increased. The use of vegetable oils (VO) and waste cooking oils (WCO) could represent interesting alternative fuels for Diesel engines in some specific applications (i. e., public transportation, hybrid or marine propulsion, etc.). Moreover, VO can be produced almost everywhere in the world in relatively small plants, and WCO would represent the use of a waste material which otherwise should be disposed. However, operating a Diesel engine (DE) with a different fuel might results in some problems. Indeed VO and WCO have different characteristics compared to Diesel fuel (i. e, a smaller heating value, a larger density and viscosity), and this can affect the operation of a DE. In particular the DE is expected to have some problem at the injection system and power loss. In this work different vegetable oils (both straight and waste) are used to fuel a DE in automotive configuration and study its behavior. Tests are performed using a turbocharged, four stroke, four cylinders, water cooled, common-rail multijet DE. The influence of fuel used on engine power, specific consumption, efficiency, and exhaust opacity, are compared with those obtained fuelling with Diesel fuel...|$|E

40|$|As the European forest {{industry}} {{takes up the}} challenge of certification, it is also called upon to develop a strategy which mitigates the effects of climate change. From the latter perspective, the {{forest industry}} is solicited to pursue the carbon neutrality of its activity (through the Exchange Trade System). Today, public policies have thus led the forestry industry to develop green energy by biomass cogeneration. Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electricity and heat, {{both of which are}} used in paper-making. The aim of policy is to extend such production of electricity to cover domestic consumption. Such a path makes the forest and paper industries go deeper in the sustainability of their activities but it also makes them develop new strategies. From {{the point of view of}} political science, this new policy and industrial orientation can be best examined through analyzing the making and implementing of the territorial environmental strategies that cover both certification and forestry programs. In industrial terms, such a strategy not only challenges current practices of local resources provision and the valorisation of wood wastes, but more fundamentally still it constitutes the development of a new path, a new market and new constraints (in terms of norms and competition). The aim of our proposal is to highlight the displacements of regulatory decision-making between superior levels (top-down logic) and the political work undertaken by political enterprises on the ground (bottom-up logic). At the same time, analysis will encompass the normative environment and the convergence of green politics with competitive opportunities in the forest-wood-paper system.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{interest}} in implementing solar energy on vehicles (electrical and hybrid) has grown significantly [1]. There are currently limitations in this sector, such as the low energy density (efficiency of conversion) of this source, {{but it is still}} a renewable resource and as such, there is a growing interest [1]. A “smart” energy strategy implemented on a solar/electrical vehicle, in order to increase its energy harvesting volume, could enhance the growth of this sector. A tracking algorithm for a solar vehicle’s MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracker) can be designed to source solar energy very effectively and to increase the speed of finding (tracking) this optimal sourcing point (solar panel voltage and current). Even though there are many different MPPT algorithms, it was decided that most of them were designed for stationary MPPT applications and the dynamics of implementing a MPPT on a vehicle create some unique scenarios. These include: Shadow flicker. This is rhythmic, rapid moving shadows across a solar panel, such as shadows from a line of trees: Rapid changes in solar panel orientation due to the road surface/relief; Rapid changes in panel temperature due to the location of the vehicle. The aim of the research can be divided into three outcomes: 1 Creating a “Smart” energy strategy/control, 2 Implement the new control system on a solar vehicle’s MPPT, and 3 Harvesting maximum energy from solar panels using the <b>new</b> <b>energy</b> <b>strategy.</b> The term “smart” is used to indicate the ability of the MPPT algorithm to be updated and improved based on previous results.
