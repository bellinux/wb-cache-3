5|$|Worldwide {{there are}} now over two hundred {{thousand}} wind turbines operating, with a total <b>nameplate</b> <b>capacity</b> of 432 GW as of end 2015. The European Union alone passed some 100 GW <b>nameplate</b> <b>capacity</b> in September 2012, while the United States surpassed 75 GW in 2015 and China's grid connected capacity passed 145 GW in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The plant had a peak {{generation}} capability, or <b>nameplate</b> <b>capacity,</b> {{of about}} 400MWe, with design features to allow expansion {{to as much}} as 1000MWe.|$|E
5|$|The {{load factor}} (or {{capacity}} factor) for South Australian wind farms is {{usually in the}} range 32-38%. This means that a wind farm could typically produce between 32 and 38% of its <b>nameplate</b> <b>capacity</b> averaged over a year.|$|E
50|$|The KEV {{remuneration}} (see below) {{also applies}} to small-scale hydro power plants with <b>nameplate</b> <b>capacities</b> up to 10 megawatts.|$|R
50|$|So-called {{bottom-up}} models {{capture the}} engineering well and often rely on techniques from operations research. Individual plants {{are characterized by}} their efficiency curves (also known as input/output relations), <b>nameplate</b> <b>capacities,</b> investment costs (capex), and operating costs (opex). Some models allow for these parameters to depend on external conditions, such as ambient temperature.|$|R

5|$|Wind power {{capacity}} has expanded rapidly to 336 GW in June 2014, and {{wind energy production}} was around 4% of total worldwide electric power usage, and growing rapidly. The actual amount of electric power that wind is able to generate is calculated by multiplying the <b>nameplate</b> <b>capacity</b> by the capacity factor, which varies according to equipment and location. Estimates of the capacity factors for wind installations {{are in the range}} of 35% to 44%.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{power is}} variable, and during low wind periods {{it must be}} {{replaced}} by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power, is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, {{may be able to}} deliver their <b>nameplate</b> <b>capacity</b> around 95% of the time.|$|E
5|$|With {{investment}} subsidies, {{the financial}} burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out {{as a function of}} the <b>nameplate</b> <b>capacity</b> of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as Austin Energy in Texas, which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{structural}} {{limitations of}} buildings, limited space in urban areas, and safety considerations, wind turbines mounted on buildings are usually small (with <b>nameplate</b> <b>capacities</b> {{in the low}} kilowatts), rather than the megawatt-class wind turbines that are most economical for wind farms. An exception is the Bahrain World Trade Centre with three 225 kW wind turbines mounted between twin skyscrapers.|$|R

5|$|In some countries, the <b>nameplate</b> <b>capacity</b> of a {{photovoltaic}} {{power stations}} is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), {{which refers to}} the solar array's DC power output. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in MWAC; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. A third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E
5|$|In the UK {{there were}} 124 {{separate}} occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell {{to less than}} 2% of installed capacity. A report on Denmark's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1% of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002. Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind {{can be dealt with}} by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC. Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power. According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced (i.e. about 8% of total <b>nameplate</b> <b>capacity)</b> to be used as reliable, baseload electric power which can be relied on to handle peak loads, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} many large plants under {{construction}}. The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm {{under construction in}} Riverside County, California and Topaz Solar Farm being built in San Luis Obispo County, California are both 550 MW solar parks that will use thin-film solar photovoltaic modules made by First Solar.
