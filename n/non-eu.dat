5|$|Spanish {{teams are}} limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list {{includes}} only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against <b>non-EU</b> quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.|$|E
5|$|Berger {{was born}} in Prague, Czechoslovakia. His uncle is the Czech footballer Jan Berger. He married wife Jaroslava, and has two children, son Patrik and {{daughter}} Valentýnka. He gained a British passport in 2001 after having spent five years playing club football in England. This enabled him to play without needing a work permit, which he had previously required due to the Premier League's rules on <b>non-EU</b> players.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{teams are}} limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list {{includes}} only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries—countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement—are not counted against <b>non-EU</b> quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Bosnia, Bulgaria, Macedonia (which had pegged their currencies against the Deutsche Mark) and Cape Verde (formerly pegged to the Portuguese escudo), all of these <b>non-EU</b> countries had a currency peg to the French Franc before pegging their currencies to the euro. Pegging a country's currency to a major currency {{is regarded as a}} safety measure, especially for currencies of areas with weak economies, as the euro is seen as a stable currency, prevents runaway inflation and encourages foreign investment due to its stability.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players {{in favour of}} foreign players, in 1999, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union. A <b>non-EU</b> player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75percent of its competitive 'A' team matches {{for which he was}} available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.|$|E
5|$|During Jean-Marie Le Pen's presidency, {{the party}} has also been active in {{establishing}} extra-parliamentary confederations. During the FN's 1997 national congress, the FN established the loose Euronat group, which consisted {{of a variety of}} European right-wing parties. Having failed to cooperate in the European Parliament, Le Pen sought in the mid-1990s to initiate contacts with other far-right parties, including from <b>non-EU</b> countries. The FN drew most support in Central and Eastern Europe, and Le Pen visited the Turkish Welfare Party. The significant Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) refused to join the efforts, as Jörg Haider sought to distance himself from Le Pen, and later attempted to build a separate group. In 2009, the FN joined the Alliance of European National Movements; it left the alliance since. Along with some other European parties, the FN in 2010 visited Japan's Issuikai ("right-wing") movement and the Yasukuni Shrine.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{voting rights}} in {{municipal}} elections were extended to non-European Union foreigners living in Belgium, with certain conditions attached. <b>Non-EU</b> foreigners {{must have been}} living in Belgium {{for at least five years}} before becoming entitled to vote. Any <b>non-EU</b> foreigner who wants to take advantage of the new legislation must also sign an oath of allegiance to the Belgian constitution, formally agree to respect the country’s laws and sign the European Convention on Human Rights. Also, <b>non-EU</b> foreigners are not allowed to stand as candidates.|$|E
25|$|Up to five <b>non-EU</b> {{nationals}} can {{be registered}} {{and given a}} squad number for the first team in the First League, however only three can be used during a match day. Those <b>non-EU</b> nationals with European ancestry can claim citizenship from the nation their ancestors came from. If a player does not have European ancestry he can claim Bulgarian citizenship after playing in Bulgaria for five years.|$|E
25|$|Teams in the Cypriot First Division can {{register}} up to eighteen <b>non-EU</b> nationals {{and players}} with European ancestry.|$|E
25|$|However, {{official}} statistics showed that EU and <b>non-EU</b> mass immigration, together with asylum seeker applications, all increased substantially during Cameron's term in office.|$|E
25|$|In December 1996 two <b>non-EU</b> member states, Norway and Iceland, {{signed an}} {{association}} {{agreement with the}} signatories of the Agreement {{to become part of}} the Schengen Area. While this agreement never came into force, both countries did become part of the Schengen Area after concluding similar agreements with the EU. The Schengen Convention itself was not open for signature by <b>non-EU</b> member states. In 2009, Switzerland finalised its official entry to the Schengen Area with the acceptance of an association agreement by popular referendum in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Beginning with 2009, {{the driving}} licence respects the EU format without any English {{translations}} anymore which may confuse lots of non-Romanian language speakers or <b>non-EU</b> residents.|$|E
25|$|On 2 July 2010, the FIGC {{announced}} {{only one}} new <b>non-EU</b> signing from abroad could be registered, {{instead of two}} in previous season. They are marked yellow.|$|E
25|$|When in a <b>non-EU</b> country, EU {{citizens}} whose country maintains no embassy {{there have}} the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present there.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{these rights}} were {{extended}} for local elections to <b>non-EU</b> foreigners. 12,762 foreign residents {{out of a}} potential electorate of 266,250 actually registered {{to vote for the}} November 2010 local elections.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{elective}} local consultative council for foreigners, notably in Rome, and since 2005 several municipal councils voted motions {{asking for the}} extension of voting rights to <b>non-EU</b> residents.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} team selection, matchday squads must {{have no more}} than five <b>non-EU</b> representatives. Seven {{substitutes}} are permitted to be selected, from which three can be used in the duration of the game.|$|E
25|$|When in a <b>non-EU</b> {{country where}} there is no Bulgarian embassy, Bulgarian {{citizens}} as EU citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.|$|E
25|$|Under LNR rules, {{teams are}} limited to two players of <b>non-EU</b> {{nationality}} on their domestic match-day rosters. However, {{a large number of}} players whose primary nationality is outside the EU are exempt from this quota for various reasons.|$|E
25|$|When in a <b>non-EU</b> {{country where}} there is no British embassy, British citizens, like all other EU citizens, have the right to get {{consular}} protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.|$|E
25|$|As a German university, tuition is free. However, the University of Freiburg does {{charge a}} 210 EUR fee {{per year for}} all {{undergraduate}} and most graduate and doctoral programs, regardless of the EU or <b>non-EU</b> citizenship of students.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} the decision has allowed English county cricket clubs {{to employ the}} services of a multitude of overseas cricketers, especially from South Africa. Prior to the Kolpak ruling ECB rules had limited each county to one overseas (<b>non-EU)</b> professional.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-EU</b> {{family members}} who {{otherwise}} require a Schengen visa will still need one before they travel to Switzerland even if they possess a UK residence permit that clearly mentions {{that they are the}} family member of an EEA citizen.|$|E
25|$|The process, an {{intergovernmental}} agreement between EU and <b>non-EU</b> countries, {{does not have}} the status of EU legislation. Since the Bologna Declaration is not a treaty or convention, there are no legal obligations for the signatory states; participation and cooperation are voluntary.|$|E
25|$|Kolpak was ejected by {{his club}} in 2000 {{as they had}} filled their quota of two <b>non-EU</b> players. Kolpak {{challenged}} the German Handball Association, claiming that Rule 15, by treating him differently from German citizens, placed an illegal restriction on his freedom of movement as a worker. The German Handball Association held that equality of treatment applied only to citizens of European Union countries (as per the Bosman Ruling) and not to <b>non-EU</b> citizens. The case was referred by the German higher court to the European Court of Justice, for a determination on whether the Association Agreement between Slovakia and the European Union provided equal rights for Slovak workers who were living and working legally within the EU. The Court ruled in favour of Kolpak.|$|E
25|$|ESA is not {{an agency}} or body of the European Union (EU), and has <b>non-EU</b> {{countries}} (Norway, and Switzerland) as members. There are however ties between the two, with various agreements in place and being worked on, to define {{the legal status of}} ESA with regard to the EU.|$|E
25|$|In {{a related}} issue, New Zealand player Andrew Mehrtens, {{who was born}} in Durban, decided to pursue a South African {{passport}} when he signed with the English side Harlequins for the 2005–06 National Division One season, as it would enable the club to sign another <b>non-EU</b> and non-Kolpak player.|$|E
25|$|The {{match was}} {{broadcast}} live {{on national television}} stations in 17 European Union countries, {{as well as several}} other <b>non-EU</b> European nations, with host broadcasting provided by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). In the UK, the match was shown on BBC Three and on the BBC Online website.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} {{means that}} <b>non-EU</b> Schengen member states have few formally binding options {{to influence the}} shaping and evolution of Schengen rules; their options are effectively reduced to agreeing or withdrawing from the agreement. However, consultations with affected countries are conducted prior {{to the adoption of}} particular new legislation.|$|E
25|$|Since May 2004, {{with the}} {{accession}} of the Baltic states and Poland, the Baltic Sea {{has been almost}} entirely surrounded by countries of the European Union (EU). The only remaining <b>non-EU</b> shore areas are Russian: the Saint Petersburg area and the exclave of the Kaliningrad Oblast.|$|E

25|$|The German exclave town of Büsingen am Hochrhein, fully {{surrounded}} by Switzerland, is in customs {{union with the}} latter <b>non-EU</b> country. The euro is legal tender, although the Swiss franc is preferred. Büsingen is excluded from the EU customs union and VAT area. Swiss VAT and sales taxes are paid.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, it was {{reported}} that Sokolov cancelled a planned concert in London because of British visa requirements demanding that all <b>non-E.U.</b> workers provide fingerprints and eye prints with every visa application (he also cancelled his 2008 concert on seemingly similar grounds). Sokolov protested that such requirements had echoes of Soviet oppression.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{cluster of}} <b>non-EU</b> immigrant population are the larger urban centers, especially the Municipality of Athens, with 132,000 immigrants comprising 17% {{of the local}} population, and then Thessaloniki, with 27,000 immigrants reaching 7% of the local population. There is also {{a considerable number of}} co-ethnics that came from the Greek communities of Albania and the former Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Arsenal {{expressed}} interest in signing Ronaldinho, but the move collapsed after he could not obtain a work permit {{because he was a}} <b>non-EU</b> player who had not played enough international matches. He considered playing on loan with Scottish Premier League side St Mirren, which never happened due to his involvement in a fake passport scandal in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Much to the {{disapproval of}} his {{coalition}} partners, Verhofstadt and his VLD opposed granting {{the right to}} vote to <b>non-EU</b> residents. Instead, they proposed and were able to liberalise the procedure for obtaining Belgian citizenship. During the prelude to the Iraq crisis of 2003, Belgium joined France, Germany and Russia in opposition to the invasion.|$|E
