Various film studios rejected the script until the financial success of Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone. Zemeckis approached Steven Spielberg, who agreed to produce the project at Amblin Entertainment, with Universal Pictures as distributor. The first choice {{for the role of}} Marty McFly was Michael J. Fox. However, he was busy filming his television series Family Ties and the show's producers would not allow him to star in the film. Consequently, Eric Stoltz was cast in the role. During filming, Stoltz and the filmmakers decided that the role was miscast, and Fox was again approached for the part. <b>Now</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> flexibility in his schedule and the blessing of his show's producers, Fox managed to work out a timetable in which he could give enough time and commitment to both.|$|E

'Well,' said the Lord Secretary, 'I will draw up a petition for you, and will also set my hand thereto.' Then said they, 'But when shall we call for it at the hands of our Lord?' But he answered, 'Yourselves must be present at the doing of it; yea, you must put your desires to it. True, the hand and pen shall be mine, but the ink and paper must be yours; else how can you say it is your petition? Nor have I need to petition for myself, because I have not offended.' He also added as followeth: 'No petition goes from me in my name to the Prince, and so to his Father by him, but when the people that are chiefly concerned therein do join in heart and soul in the matter, for that must be inserted therein.' ...|$|E

6000|$|On the 22nd (day of the {{suppression}} of the Times) de Coetlogon wrote to inquire if hostilities were intended against Great Britain, which Knappe on the same day denied. On the 23rd de Coetlogon sent a complaint of hostile acts, such as the armed and forcible entry of the Richmond before the declaration and arrest of Gallien. In his reply, dated the 24th, Knappe took occasion to repeat, although <b>now</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> self-command, his former threat against de Coetlogon. [...] "I am still of the opinion," [...] he writes, [...] "that even foreign consuls are liable to the application of martial law, if they are guilty of offences against the belligerent state." [...] The same day (24th) de Coetlogon complained that Fletcher, manager for Messrs. MacArthur, had been summoned by Fritze. In answer, Knappe had [...] "the honour to inform your Excellency that since the declaration of the state of war, British subjects are liable to martial law, and Mr. Fletcher will be arrested if he does not appear." [...] Here, then, was the gauntlet thrown down, and de Coetlogon was burning to accept it. Fletcher's offence was this. Upon the 22nd a steamer had come in from Wellington, specially chartered to bring German despatches to Apia. The rumour came along with her from New Zealand that in these despatches Knappe would find himself rebuked, and Fletcher was accused of having [...] "interested himself in the spreading of this rumour." [...] His arrest was actually ordered, when Hand succeeded in persuading him to surrender. At the German court, the case was dismissed [...] "wegen Nichtigkeit"; and the acute stage of these distempers may be said to have ended. Blessed are the peacemakers. Hand had perhaps averted a collision. What is more certain, he had offered to the world a perfectly original reading of the part of British seaman.|$|E

[...] Where now was the instructor of his pride? [...] Slept the old pilot in so rough a tide, [...] Whose wiles had from the happy shore betray'd, [...] And thus on shelves the credulous youth convey'd?

[...] For thee did Canaan's milk and honey flow, [...] Love dress'd thy bowers, and laurels sought thy brow; [...] 880 [...] Preferment, wealth, and power thy vassals were, [...] And of a monarch all things but the care. [...] Oh! should our crimes again that curse draw down, [...] And rebel-arms once more attempt the crown, [...] Sure ruin waits unhappy Absalom, [...] Alike by conquest or defeat undone.
