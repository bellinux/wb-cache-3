5|$|An inverse agonist {{can have}} effects {{similar to those}} of an antagonist, but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a rise in cases of {{undisclosed}} synthetic diamond melee being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade. Due to the relatively inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in synthetic melee identification being made.|$|E

Recordings are now available of all the operas from Il crociato onwards, for many of the earlier Italian operas, and for other pieces including his songs and the incidental music for Struensee.|$|E

5|$|<b>Now</b> <b>beginning</b> {{to compose}} independently, Rachmaninoff's next project {{was a group}} he titled Three Nocturnes, and is {{regarded}} as his first serious attempt at writing for the piano. The first nocturne, in F-sharp minor, was written 14-21 November 1887, and has three parts: a beginning and an end in andante cantabile and a central section in allegro. The slower andantes are gentle sections, influenced by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, while the allegro is unnatural and stiff and unusually fast for a nocturne. The second piece, in F major, followed on 22-25 November, also contains a slower portion coupled with a quick section. No. 3, in C minor, {{took more than a}} month to compose, dated from 3 December 1886 to 12 January 1887. With a chordal texture spread over the entire keyboard, it is reminiscent of the music of Robert Schumann. The nocturnes were published posthumously in Moscow in 1949, but were not assigned an opus number.|$|E

She wants to be seen as normal girl, and is reluctant to reveal that she is a trans woman. She is also poor and hearing-impaired; she speaks English as a second language, and she is living away from her mother for the first time. Raci and her aunt rent a small room in Eastside Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Then came {{a decline}} in his career {{at such a young}} age which began soon after the arrival of new manager Alex Ferguson in November 1986, the change of manager coming after a dismal start to the season led to the {{decision}} to sack Ron Atkinson. Whiteside, still only 21, was facing trouble from his right knee which was <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> to require serious medical procedures to prevent it from causing his retirement. Ferguson put Whiteside back up front, and in turn he scored three times in his first four games back from injury. Ferguson did though have to rebuke Whiteside after some of his numerous drinking sessions. He ended the 1986–87 season with 10 goals in 37 appearances, however United could only manage an 11th-place finish.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of the Vengeance force, by late 1942 the RAAF was aware that the type was obsolete and other Allied air forces' experiences had demonstrated that dive bombing was an inefficient tactic. Combat experience in Europe showed that dedicated dive bombers were highly vulnerable to attack from fighter aircraft, especially when preparing to dive on targets. Few USAAF officers regarded dive bombers as effective, though they were frequently used by the United States Navy. A USAAF squadron equipped with Douglas A-24 Banshee dive bombers was deployed to New Guinea in April 1942, but was withdrawn from combat at the end of May that year after flying only a few combat sorties. The USAAF regarded this type as unsuited to conditions in the theatre, though the US Navy operated it very successfully from its aircraft carriers as the Douglas SBD Dauntless. The USAAF preferred to use fighter-bombers and light bombers to support ground troops in New Guinea, fighter-bombers especially as they could strafe and skip bomb Japanese positions as well as employ dive-bombing tactics. Similarly, by late 1942 the RAAF preferred to use the light bombers that it was <b>now</b> <b>beginning</b> to receive to provide tactical support for the Army. An order for 150 Curtis Shrike dive bombers was cancelled after the first ten of these aircraft were delivered to Australia in November 1942, making the Vengeance the only dedicated dive bomber operated by the RAAF.|$|E

France's defeat meant that Britain and other allies would look to the U.S. for large supplies of materials for the war.|$|E
