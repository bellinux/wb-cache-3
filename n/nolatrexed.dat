40|$|A {{clinical}} study of <b>nolatrexed</b> dihydrochloride (AG 337, ThymitaqTM) {{in combination with}} paclitaxel was performed. The aims were to optimize the schedule of administration and determine any pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between the two drugs. In vitro combination studies were performed to assist with schedule optimization. Three patients were entered on each of three different schedules of administration of the two drugs: (1) paclitaxel 0 – 3 h, <b>nolatrexed</b> 24 – 144 h; (2) <b>nolatrexed</b> 0 – 120 h, paclitaxel 48 – 51 h; (3) <b>nolatrexed</b> 0 – 120 h, paclitaxel 126 – 129 h. Paclitaxel was administered at a dose of 80 mg m− 2 over 3 h and <b>nolatrexed</b> at a dose of 500 mg m− 2 day− 1 as a 120 -h continuous intravenous infusion. Plasma concentrations of both drugs were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. In vitro growth inhibition studies using corresponding schedules were performed using two head and neck cancer cell lines. In both HNX 14 C and HNX 22 B cell lines, synergistic growth inhibition was observed on schedule 2, whereas schedules 1 and 3 demonstrated antagonistic effects. In the {{clinical study}}, there was no effect of schedule on the pharmacokinetics of <b>nolatrexed.</b> However, patients on schedules 1 and 3 had a higher clearance of paclitaxel (322 – 520 ml min− 1 m− 2) than those on schedule 2 (165 – 238 ml min− 1 m− 2). Peak plasma concentrations (1. 66 – 1. 93 vs 0. 86 – 1. 32 μM) and areas under the curve (392 – 565 vs 180 – 291 μM min− 1) of paclitaxel were correspondingly higher on schedule 2. The pharmacokinetic interaction was confirmed by studies with human liver microsomes, <b>nolatrexed</b> being an inhibitor of the major routes of metabolism of paclitaxel. Toxicity was not schedule-dependent. <b>Nolatrexed</b> and paclitaxel may be safely given together when administered sequentially at the doses used in this study. Studies in vitro suggest some synergy, however, due to a pharmacokinetic interaction, paclitaxel doses should be reduced when administered during <b>nolatrexed</b> infusion. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The serine/threonine protein phosphatases 1 (PP 1) and 2 A (PP 2 A) are key enzymes in {{regulating}} {{entry into the}} cell cycle, mitosis and apoptosis. Inhibition of PP 1 and PP 2 A is associated with enhanced S-phase entry culminating in G 2 /M arrest and apoptotic cell death. Thymidylate synthase (TS) is a key regulatory enzyme in DNA synthesis, inhibition of which is often a first-line treatment for colorectal carcinoma. In this study the effect of combining PP inhibition with TS inhibition in two colorectal cell lines was examined. Methods: Cantharidin and <b>nolatrexed</b> were used to inhibit PP and TS activity, respectively. The MTT cytotoxicity assay and cell cycle analysis were performed following single-drug treatment of HT 29 and HCT 116 colorectal cell lines. The median effect method {{was used to determine}} a combination index (CI), where drug antagonism was indicated by a CI> 1. 1, additivity by a CI between 0. 9 and 1. 1, and synergism by a CI< 0. 9. Results: Both cell lines were equally sensitive to cantharidin alone (GI 50 values 5. 4 and 7. 3 mgrM), which induced {{a significant increase in the}} S-phase population of both cell lines within 6 h with a concomitant increase in DNA synthesis. This response culminated in G 2 /M cell cycle arrest within 24 h and subsequent cell death. In response to <b>nolatrexed</b> alone, HT 29 cells were more sensitive than HCT 116 cells (GI 50 1. 9 mgrM vs 9. 8 mgrM), with G 1 /S-phase cell cycle arrest occurring within 24 h in both cell lines. In HT 29 cells, this was followed by cell death, whereas in HCT 116 cells, a proportion of cells died following arrest but the predominant event was re-entry into the cell cycle. The simultaneous exposure of HT 29 cells to the combination of <b>nolatrexed</b> and cantharidin in drug molar ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2. 5 for 72 h was synergistic producing composite CIs of 0. 88 and 0. 87, respectively. The sequence of <b>nolatrexed</b> followed by cantharidin 24 h later resulted in greater synergism (CI values of 0. 75, 0. 52, 0. 55, 0. 68 for molar ratios of 10 : 1, 1 : 1, 1 : 2. 5, 1 : 10), whereas the reverse sequence was antagonistic, suggesting that the point of interaction is downstream of TS inhibition. In HCT 116 cells only additive and antagonistic interactions were observed for any of the treatment combinations. The lack of synergism in these cells may be caused by the reduced sensitivity of these cells to <b>nolatrexed</b> as a single agent. Conclusion: The effect of TS inhibition can be enhanced by the inhibition of serine/threonine protein phosphatases...|$|E
40|$|Dipyridamole {{has been}} shown to enhance the in vitro {{activity}} of antimetabolite anticancer drugs through the inhibition of nucleoside transport. However, the clinical potential of dipyridamole has not been realized because of the avid binding of the drug to the plasma protein alpha 1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP). Dipyridamole analogues that retain potent nucleoside transport inhibitory activity in the presence of AGP are described and their ability to enhance the growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitors has been evaluated. Three dipyridamole analogues (NU 3026, NU 3059 and NU 3060) were shown to enhance the growth inhibitory activity of the TS inhibitor CB 3717 and block thymidine rescue in L 1210 cells. The extent of potentiation at a fixed analogue concentration (10 microM) was related to the potency of inhibition of thymidine uptake. A further analogue, NU 3076, was identified, which was more potent than dipyridamole with a Ki value for inhibition of thymidine uptake of 0. 1 microM compared to 0. 28 microM for dipyridamole. In marked contrast to dipyridamole, inhibition of thymidine uptake by NU 3076 was not significantly affected by the presence of AGP (5 mg ml(- 1)). NU 3076 and dipyridamole produced equivalent potentiation of the cytotoxicity of the non-classical antifolate TS inhibitor, <b>nolatrexed,</b> in L 1210 cells with both compounds significantly reducing the LC 90, by > threefold in the absence of salvageable thymidine. Thymidine rescue of L 1210 cells from <b>nolatrexed</b> cytotoxicity was partially blocked by both 1 microM NU 3076 and 1 microM dipyridamole. NU 3076 also caused a significant potentiation of FU cytotoxicity in L 1210 cells. These studies demonstrate that nucleoside transport inhibition can be maintained in the absence of AGP binding with the dipyridamole pharmacophore and that such analogues can enhance the cytotoxicity of TS inhibitors.

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{resistance}} to fluoropyrimidines and other inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (TS) {{is a serious}} clinical problem often associated with increased intracellular levels of TS. Since the tumour suppressor gene p 53, which is mutated in 50 % of CRC, regulates the expression of several genes, it may modulate TS activity, {{and changes in the}} status of p 53 might be responsible for chemoresistance. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate TS levels and sensitivity to TS inhibitors in wild-type (wt) and mutant (mt) p 53 CRC cells, Lovo and WiDr, respectively, transfected with mt and wt p 53. Lovo 175 X 2 cells (transfected with mt p 53) were more resistant to 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU; 2 -fold), <b>nolatrexed</b> (3 -fold), raltitrexed (3 -fold) and pemetrexed (10 -fold) in comparison with the wt p 53 parental cells Lovo 92. Resistance was associated with an increase in TS protein expression and catalytic activity, which might be caused by the loss of the inhibitory effect on the activity of TS promoter or by the lack of TS mRNA degradation, as suggested by the reversal of TS expression to the levels of Lovo 92 cells by adding actinomycin. In contrast, Lovo li cells, characterized by functionally inactive p 53, were 3 - 13 -fold more sensitive to <b>nolatrexed,</b> raltitrexed and pemetrexed, and had a lower TS mRNA, protein expression and catalytic activity than Lovo 92. However, MDM- 2 expression was significantly higher in Lovo li, while no significant differences were observed in Lovo 175 X 2 cells with respect to Lovo 92. Finally, mt p 53 WiDr transfected with wt p 53 were not significantly different from mt p 53 WiDr cells with respect to sensitivity to TS inhibitors or TS levels. Altogether, these results indicate that changes in the status of p 53, can differently alter sensitivity to TS inhibitors by affecting TS levels, depending on activity or cell line, and might explain the lack of clear correlation between mutations in p 53 and clinical outcome after chemotherapy with TS inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{reprogramming}} of {{tumor cells}} toward serine catabolism is now {{recognized as a}} hallmark of cancer. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), the enzyme providing one-carbon units by converting serine and tetrahydrofolate (H 4 PteGlu) to glycine and 5, 10 -CH 2 -H 4 PteGlu, therefore represents a target of interest in developing new chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, 13 folate analogues under clinical evaluation or in therapeutic use were in silico screened against SHMT, ultimately identifying four antifolate agents worthy of closer evaluation. The interaction mode of SHMT with these four antifolate drugs (lometrexol, <b>nolatrexed,</b> raltitrexed, and methotrexate) was assessed. The mechanism of SHMT inhibition by the selected antifolate agents was investigated in vitro using the human cytosolic isozyme. The {{results of this study}} showed that lometrexol competitively inhibits SHMT with inhibition constant (Ki) values in the low micromolar. The binding mode of lometrexol to SHMT was further investigated by molecular docking. These results thus provide insights into the mechanism of action of antifolate drugs and constitute the basis for the rational design of novel and more potent inhibitors of SHMT...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{its place}} as the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, there are {{currently}} no approved chemotherapeutic agents, devices or techniques to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. Importantly, {{there have been no}} phase III studies demonstrating survival benefit, nor any randomized studies of treatment except for transarterial chemoembolization and most recently sorafenib. The importance of well-designed clinical trials of agents to treat HCC has never been greater. However, general clinical study design issues, combined with HCC-specific issues pose significant challenges in structuring such studies. HCC-related challenges include the heterogeneity of this cancer {{and the fact that it}} is frequently accompanied by significant comorbidities at diagnosis, such as active hepatitis B or C virus replication, substantial past or on-going alcohol use, and cirrhosis, itself often a fatal disease. The recently published comparison of a newer treatment, <b>nolatrexed</b> to doxorubicin, and comments about this study’s initial HCC diagnostic criteria, staging system, comparator therapy and choice of endpoints have provided a platform to discuss the challenges unique to the design of HCC clinical trials. The difficulty in accurately framing study results obtained from the constantly changing HCC clinical landscape and approaches to meet these challenges will be reviewed...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the potent poly(ADP-ribose) {{polymerase}} (PARP) inhibitor, NU 1025 (8 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl-quinazolin- 4 -[3 H]one) to potentiate the cytotoxicity of a panel of mechanistically diverse anti-cancer agents was evaluated in L 1210 cells. NU 1025 enhanced the cytotoxicity of the DNA-methylating agent MTIC, gamma-irradiation and bleomycin 3. 5 -, 1. 4 - and 2 -fold respectively. The cytotoxicities of the thymidylate synthase inhibitor, <b>nolatrexed,</b> and the cytotoxic nucleoside, gemcitabine, were not increased. Potentiation of MTIC cytotoxicity by a delayed exposure to NU 1025 was equally effective as by a simultaneous exposure to NU 1025, indicating {{that the effects of}} NU 1025 were mediated by an inhibition of the cellular recovery. The recovery from potentially lethal gamma-irradiation damage cytotoxicity in plateau-phase cells was also inhibited by NU 1025. Investigation of DNA strand breakage and repair in gamma-irradiated cells by alkaline elution demonstrated that NU 1025 caused a marked retardation of DNA repair. A structurally different PARP inhibitor, NU 1064 (2 -methylbenzimidazole- 4 -carboxamide), also potentiated the cytotoxicity of MTIC, to a similar extent to NU 1025. NU 1064 potentiated a sublethal concentration of a DNA methylating agent in a concentration-dependent manner. Collectively, these data suggest that the most suitable cytotoxic agents for use in combination with PARP inhibitors are methylating agents, bleomycin and ionizing radiation, but not anti-metabolites.

40|$|Bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) is a {{chemically}} and genetically validated {{target in}} African trypanosomes, causative agents of sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. Here we report the kinetic properties and sensitivity of recombinant enzyme {{to a range}} of lipophilic and classical antifolate drugs. The purified recombinant enzyme, expressed as a fusion protein with elongation factor Ts (Tsf) in ThyA- Escherichia coli, retains DHFR activity, but lacks any TS activity. TS activity was found to be extremely unstable (half-life of 28 s) following desalting of clarified bacterial lysates to remove small molecules. Stability could be improved 700 -fold by inclusion of dUMP, but not by other pyrimidine or purine (deoxy) -nucleosides or nucleotides. Inclusion of dUMP during purification proved insufficient to prevent inactivation during the purification procedure. Methotrexate and trimetrexate were the most potent inhibitors of DHFR (Ki 0. 1 and 0. 6 nM, respectively) and FdUMP and <b>nolatrexed</b> of TS (Ki 14 and 39 nM, respectively). All inhibitors showed a marked drop-off in potency of 100 - to 1, 000 -fold against trypanosomes grown in low folate medium lacking thymidine. The most potent inhibitors possessed a terminal glutamate moiety suggesting that transport or subsequent retention by polyglutamylation was important for biological activity.

40|$|Melanoma {{is one of}} {{the most}} common cancers, and its {{incidence}} has continued to increase over the past few decades. Chemotherapy resistance and related defects in apoptotic signaling are critical for the high mortality of melanoma. Effective drugs are lacking because apoptosis regulation in this tumor type is not well understood. The folate pathway has been considered an interesting target for anticancer therapies, and approaches targeting this pathway have recently been extended to melanoma treatment. In this study, the intracellular apoptosis signaling pathways of two melanoma cells lines (SK-MEL- 2 and SK-MEL- 28) were investigated after treatment with a new experimental antifolate substance (MR 36) that targets thymidylate synthase. In both melanoma cell lines, apoptosis induction was triggered by a p 53 -independent mechanism. MR 36 -induced apoptosis was associated with a loss of both mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase- 3 activation. Induction of cell cycle arrest by MR 36 was associated with changes in the expression of key cell cycle regulators, such as p 21 and cyclin D 1, and the hypophosphorylation of pRb. In addition, Fas signaling was also analyzed. These findings suggest that, unlike classical antifolates, MR 36 exerted an inhibitory effect on both the enzymatic function and expression of thymidylate synthase, thereby inducing apoptosis through the activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in the melanoma cell lines. MR 36 showed a different mechanism of action from the known antifolates (<b>Nolatrexed</b> and Pemetrexed) that resulted in higher anticancer activity. Therefore, MR 36 should be included as a potential new therapeutic treatment in melanoma research...|$|E
