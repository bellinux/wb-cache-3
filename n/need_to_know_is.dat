500|$|Critics drew close {{comparisons}} between Obsessed and Adrian Lyne's 1987 stalker thriller Fatal Attraction. However, two distinctions noted were that Obsessed contains no bunny boiling-like incidents, and that Derek and Lisa {{did not actually}} have sexual intercourse. John Anderson of Variety wrote, [...] "If Derek had actually slept with Lisa, a la Michael Douglas in Fatal Attraction, Obsessed would at least have had the spurned-woman gambit to play, however hoary." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film zero out of four stars, and wrote that Derek's {{lack of interest in}} Lisa allowed for no conflict in the film. Travers concluded, [...] "Everything you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> in the trailer." [...] The Daily Telegraph Tim Robey thought that Obsessed would have been more entertaining had Lisa's character been fiercer like Alex Forrest in Fatal Attraction. Rickey opined that while the lack of infidelity made the film less thrilling, it [...] "is about the sanctity of marriage rather than the shame of adultery." ...|$|E
500|$|Second-term U.S Representative Joe Sestak, {{a former}} U.S. Navy admiral, began privately {{discussing}} {{the possibility of}} seeking the Democratic nomination {{with his family in}} December 2008. Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, approached Sestak in April 2009 and asked him to run, but Sestak claimed he was not initially interested. Nevertheless, media speculation about Sestak's possible campaign began as early as mid-April 2009, and intensified the day [...] Specter changed political parties. While most Democrats embraced the long-time Senator, Sestak issued a statement criticizing Specter's decision, declaring it an opportunist move that should have been made in consultation with Pennsylvanians rather than the Senate Democratic leadership and the Washington political establishment. Menendez approached Sestak again, this time asking him not to run against Specter, but Sestak did not agree to back down. Later, when asked by Fox News, Sestak insisted he had not decided whether he would run for the office, but declined to immediately endorse Specter and said he had to [...] "wait and see". During a May 3 appearance on CNN's State of the Union with John King, Sestak questioned whether Specter was really a genuine Democrat, adding, [...] "I think Arlen has to tell us not that it was too hard to run against someone. ... What I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> what is he running for?" ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Your Body", Aguilera sings {{of having}} a one-night stand with a random man. In the first verse, she [...] "angrily" [...] purrs, [...] "So open the box, don't need no key, I'm unlocked". Synthesizers and [...] "stuttering" [...] drums are {{featured}} at the pre-chorus, [...] "Don't even tell me your name/ All I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> whose place/ And let's get walking". Chris Martins of Spin commented that the lyrics actually means, [...] "The economy is in the tank, congress can't agree on anything, war and natural disasters consume us ... so, what else can we do but make love?" [...] At the second verse, she tells her lover, [...] "I am a freak, I'm disturbed/ So come on and give me your worst/ We're moving faster than slow/ If you don't know where to go/ I'll finish off on my own". The four-on-the-floor refrain has Aguilera [...] "flaunting her famous pipes" [...] on the chorus, [...] "All I wanna do is love your body/ Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it". In a track-by-track review for Lotus, Billboard critic Andrew Hampp thought that the song [...] "doesn't peak" [...] until Aguilera [...] "growls", [...] "I think you already know my name" [...] at the bridge. According to Jason Lipshutz from Billboard and Robert Cospey of Digital Spy, the lyrics of [...] "Your Body" [...] are similar to Aguilera's previous single [...] "Dirrty" [...] (2002).|$|E

[...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "All you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> that the {{performances of}} Larson and Tremblay will blow you away.

In 1996, MAXIMUM reported Psylocke being possibly the most popular X-Men character in Japan, where Capcom games have introduced the franchise to general public, [...] "due to her Japanese appearance...and ninja-esque martial arts moves". Psylocke was chosen as one of the 20 [...] "muses" [...] of video games by Brazilian magazine SuperGamePower in 2001. In the 2009 Marvel poll asking who is the better fighter in Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Psylocke got over two-thirds of the votes (68%) against the Street Fighter series icon and the fighting game genre female symbol Chun-Li. UGO ranked her as fifth on their 2011 list of fighting games' finest female fighters for her appearances in Capcom titles, stating that [...] "the only thing more confusing than Psylocke's backstory is what exactly her powers are [...] all you really <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> this: Psylocke is a sexy Asian lady ninja sporting the most obscene butt-floss this side of Linda Kozlowski in Crocodile Dundee".

If it were not for the weakness and wickedness of the priests, every one would know and understand God. Every one who was modest enough not to set up for particular knowledge. Men disputed whether God is Finite or Infinite, whether he has a triple or a single aspect. How should they know? All we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> the face he turns to us. They impose their horrible creeds and distinctions. None of those things matter. Call him Christ the God or call him simply God, Allah, Heaven; it does not matter. He comes to us, we know, like a Helper and Friend; that is all we want to know. You may speculate further if you like, but it is not religion. They dispute whether he can set aside nature. But that is superstition. He is either master of nature and he knows that it is good, or he is part of nature and must obey. That is an argument for hair-splitting metaphysicians. Either answer means the same for us. It does not matter which way we come to believe that he does not idly set the course of things aside. Obviously he does not set the course of things aside. What he does do for certain is to give us courage and save us from our selfishness and the bitter hell it makes for us. And every one knows too what sort of things we want, and for what end we want to escape from ourselves. We want to do right. And right, if you think clearly, is just truth within and service without, the service of God's kingdom, which is mankind, the service of human needs and the increase of human power and experience. It is all perfectly plain, it is all quite easy for any one to understand, who isn't misled and chattered at and threatened and poisoned by evil priests and teachers." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{had used}} the interim actively, not only in {{carrying}} out Grandcourt's orders about the stud and household, but in learning all he could of Gwendolen, and how things were going on at Offendene. What was the probable effect that {{the news of the}} family misfortunes would have on Grandcourt's fitful obstinacy he felt to be quite incalculable. So far as the girl's poverty might be an argument that she would accept an offer from him now in spite of any previous coyness, it might remove that bitter objection to risk a repulse which Lush divined to be one of Grandcourt's deterring motives; on the other hand, the certainty of acceptance was just [...] "the sort of thing" [...] to make him lapse hither and thither with no more apparent will than a moth. Lush had had his patron under close observation for many years, and knew him perhaps better than he knew any other subject; but to know Grandcourt was to doubt what he would do in any particular case. It might happen that he would behave with an apparent magnanimity, like the hero of a modern French drama, whose sudden start into moral splendor after much lying and meanness, leaves you little confidence as to any part of his career that may follow the fall of the curtain. Indeed, what attitude would have been more honorable for a final scene than that of declining to seek an heiress for her money, and determining to marry the attractive girl who had none? But Lush had some general certainties about Grandcourt, and one was that of all inward movements those of generosity were least likely to occur in him. Of what use, however, is a general certainty that an insect will not walk with his head hindmost, when what you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> the play of inward stimulus that sends him hither and thither in a network of possible paths? Thus Lush was much at fault as to the probable issue between Grandcourt and Gwendolen, when what he desired was a perfect confidence that they would never be married. He would have consented willingly that Grandcourt should marry an heiress, or that he should marry Mrs. Glasher: in the one match there would have been the immediate abundance that prospective heirship could not supply, in the other there would have been the security of the wife's gratitude, for Lush had always been Mrs. Glasher's friend; and that the future Mrs. Grandcourt should not be socially received could not affect his private comfort. He would not have minded, either, {{that there should be no}} marriage in question at all; but he felt himself justified in doing his utmost to hinder a marriage with a girl who was likely to bring nothing but trouble to her husband--not to speak of annoyance if not ultimate injury to her husband's old companion, whose future Mr. Lush earnestly wished to make as easy as possible, considering that he had well deserved such compensation for leading a dog's life, though that of a dog who enjoyed many tastes undisturbed, and who profited by a large establishment. He wished for himself what he felt to be good, and was not conscious of wishing harm to any one else; unless perhaps it were just now a little harm to the inconvenient and impertinent Gwendolen. But the easiest-humored of luxury and music, the toad-eater the least liable to nausea, must be expected to have his susceptibilities. And Mr. Lush was accustomed to be treated by the world in general as an apt, agreeable fellow: he had not made up his mind to be insulted by more than one person.|$|E
