40|$|The {{developments}} of the artificial football surface have grown quickly the past years; not only on professional level but also amateur football use these fields (artificial surface). There are hundreds of football fields today with the new developed surface {{around the country and}} also many smaller fields for training purpose. This new surface is always under development and the traditional fields (grass fields) that where frequent, with short fibers have now been replaced of long-haired artificial grass with rubber crush,   which are more like the traditional grass. The rubber or gum crush is a material called "gummigranulat" that appear in many types, but is usually made out of old recycled car tires. The <b>national</b> <b>chemicals</b> <b>inspectorate</b> published a report in February 2006. The report discussed the rubber and if the material could have some risk on the environment and health risks, despite that the risks are very small. There is no prohibition today against the rubber crush and therefore {{there is no reason to}} change existing football fields, but in long term should rubber from recycle car tires be replaced by alternative material to minimize environment and health risks. The purpose with this degree project is to examine what artificial surface are and what advantages is has in relation to natural grass, also the environment risks are going to be discussed and which environmental pollutions that can be avoid and how it influences the economics.   The advantages of using the artificial surface versus the traditional grass are: Ø Always even and smooth surface Ø Less damages with even surface Ø Not as slippery as natural grass Ø Better technical condition Ø Artificial surface stand the strain better Ø Higher durability Ø Can be used all -the -year- around Ø The possibility to arrange larger events such as concerts is easier on artificial surface than traditional grass. By studying the results from this project, following facts are shown: Ø Artificial grass has a higher length of life than natural grass Ø Many more advantages with artificial grass Ø It is 10 times cheaper to run and to maintain artificial grass in comparison to the usage of it. Ø SBR rubber is the best and most profitable rubber that is used Ø There is no proof that SBR rubber release dangerous chemicals, the rubber is soft and harmles...|$|E

50|$|The Royal Arsenal {{was caught}} up in the Blitz on 7 September 1940. After several attacks, the fuze factory was {{destroyed}} and the filling factory and a light gun factory badly damaged. Explosive filling work ceased on the site, but the production of guns, shells, cartridge cases and bombs continued. In September 1940, prior to the raid, some 32,500 people worked there; but after the raid this dropped to 19,000. The numbers employed on site had increased by February 1943, with 23,000 employed, but by August 1945 were down to 15,000. 103 people were killed and 770 injured, during 25 raids, by bombs, V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets. The staff of the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Inspectorate,</b> working with explosives, were evacuated in early September 1940. Shortly afterwards one of the Frog Island buildings was destroyed by bombing and another damaged. The laboratories were partially re-occupied in 1945 and fully re-occupied by 1949.|$|R

These included the Materials Quality Assurance Directorate (MQAD), which looked after materiel, including explosives and pyrotechnics; and the Quality Assurance Directorate (Ordnance) (QAD (Ord)), which looked after ordnance for the Army. MQAD was the successor of the old War Department Chemist and the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Inspectorate.</b> There was a separate Royal Navy Ordnance Inspection Department that looked after the Royal Navy's interests. QAD (Ord) was based at Royal Arsenal West together with a Ministry of Defence Publications section and part of the British Library's secure storage accommodation. MQAD was based, until closure of the site at Royal Arsenal East; and all the buildings on this site were given E numbers, such as E135. Belmarsh high-security prison was built on part of Royal Arsenal East, becoming operational in 1991.|$|R
