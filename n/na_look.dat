40|$|Atomic data, such as {{wavelengths}} {{and line}} identifications, {{are necessary for}} many applications, especially in plasma diagnostics and for interpreting the spectra of distant astrophysical objects. The number of valence shell electrons increases {{the complexity of the}} computational problem. We have selected a five-electron ion, Na 6 + (with the boron-like spectrum <b>Na</b> VII), for <b>looking</b> into the interplay of measurement and calculation. We summarize the available experimental work, perform our own extensive relativistic configuration interaction (RCI) computations based on multi-configuration Dirac–Hartree–Fock (MCDHF) wave functions, and compare the results to what is known of the level structure. We then discuss problems with databases that have begun to combine observations and computations...|$|R

5000|$|Like much of Le Guin's work, Always Coming Home follows Native American themes. According to Richard Erlich, [...] "Always Coming Home is {{a fictional}} retelling of much in A. L. Kroeber's father monumental Handbook of the Indians of California." [...] There {{are also some}} {{elements}} retrieved from her mother's The Inland Whale (Traditional narratives of Native California), such as {{the importance of the}} number nine, and the map of the <b>Na</b> Valley which <b>looks</b> like the Ancient Yurok World. There are also Taoist themes: the heyiya-if looks like the taijitu, and its hollow center (the [...] "hinge") is like the hub of the wheel as described in the Tao Te Ching. Additionally, in 1975, Le Guin described herself [...] "as an unconsistent Taoist and a consistent un-Christian".|$|R
40|$|Whether {{people of}} differing types can live happily {{together}} {{is one of}} the most important social and political questions concerning urban areas. From a variety of theoretical perspectives, such mixing seems extremely unlikely. While the theoretical result seems well supported in the context of race, the evidence for income mixing is much less stark. Compared to the strict segregation predicted by the models (and embodied in the context of race), Americans live in economically diverse neighborhoods. While this has lead to some further theoretical experiments, the stability of this mixing has never been addressed as an empirical matter. It would be <b>na</b> to <b>look</b> at cross-sectional snapshots of income mixing as representing stable situations, since neighborhood change is a prevalent feature of American urban economies. This paper sketches out the empirical implications of slow transition towards the predicted equilibrium, and tests those implications. It is the first paper to directly evaluate the persistence and stability of mixed-income communities. The results are supportive of the three models of income segregation: income mixing appears to be unstable, although the adjustment process is slow. This work is of especial importance due to the focus mixed-income communities receive in the urban planning and policy...|$|R
50|$|Another Pre-Spanish period {{identified}} with the old Malolos is from the accounts of the written testament of Pansomun (christened as Don Fernando Malang Balagtas), a royal native from Tabuñgao, Provincia de Calumpit. It was in his time that the Spanish conquest of Luzon happened. The testament was dated March 21, 1589. Don Fernando Malang Balagtas is a son of the great leader of pre-Hispanic Luzon in 15th century named Malasik, son of Prince Balagtas and Dayang Panginuan, descendants of Anka Wiyaya from Madjapahit Empire. In his testament, he mentioned the settlements and territories under their rule. These settlements and villages of the present day Malolos were the following: Quingua under Dayang Monmon, Lugam under Gat Maitan, Paombong also called Magong under Macaralaga, Looc <b>na</b> Malaqui (now <b>Look</b> Primero) under Gat Maitim. (La Primera Provincia pp. 9-14 Center for Bulacan Studies, 2010)Don Fernando wrote this testament in able to reclaim the privileges that the Spanish Crown had granted to the Lacandolas.|$|R
5000|$|As Minister for External Affairs he {{successfully}} increased Ireland's autonomy {{within the}} Commonwealth of Nations. O'Higgins was seen {{very much as}} the [...] "strong man" [...] of the Cabinet. He once described himself as one of [...] "the most conservative-minded revolutionaries that ever put through a successful revolution". Though far-left political enemies characterised him as having supposed [...] "fascist" [...] tendencies, O'Higgins was to the fore in resisting the small wing of Cumann <b>na</b> nGaedheal who <b>looked</b> to Italy for inspiration. He did not approve of left-wing feminism, for instance when asked by Labour Party leader Thomas Johnson in the Dáil whether he believed giving women the vote had been a success, O'Higgins replied, [...] "I {{would not like to}} pronounce an opinion on it in public." [...] He famously derided the socialist influenced Democratic Programme of the First Dáil as [...] "mostly poetry". Before his death, he toyed with Arthur Griffith's idea of a dual monarchy to end the Partition of Ireland.|$|R

Asia Brewery responded with by Max Beer, another extra strong beer, Manila Beer, a low-cost beer, and Carlsberg, (under licensed), marketed as a premium beer.

5000|$|During the {{recording}} of U2's 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind, lead vocalist Bono was aware that his father, Bob Hewson, was beginning to die from cancer. Bono subsequently wrote a song about him called [...] "Tough", as that was the impression he always had of his father; he called him: [...] "A tough old boot of a guy. Irish, Dub, north side Dubliner, very cynical about {{the world and the}} people in it, but very charming and funny with it." [...] After Bob died in 2001, Bono sang the song at his funeral. For {{the recording}} of the band's following album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, they revisited the song. While listening to it with Bono and guitarist the Edge, producer Steve Lillywhite critiqued the track, telling them that it did not have a chorus and that each verse simply was followed by the line [...] "sometimes you can't make it on your own". Bono then asked for a guitar to play and spontaneously sang the lines [...] "And it's you when I <b>look</b> <b>na</b> na na na / And it's you du du du du du du du / Sometimes you can't make it on your own". Even though Bono had not yet written the rest of the lyrics for this new segment, Lillywhite said: [...] "all of a sudden the song was finished. That song had been around for the best part of five years and no one had ever said to them that it didn't have a chorus." ...|$|R
