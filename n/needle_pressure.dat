In the experiment materials, named as Elastollan-C 60 A and Elastollan-C 70 A, are used as dust boots. During physical tests to be applied to the dust boot are as followed; hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break, recovery, compression set at 70 0 C/ 24 h, density, volume, weight, adhesive resistance, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter. During the aging tests, following steps are applied; change of hardness, change of tensile strength, volume change, change of weight, change of friction, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter at 100 0 C/ 70 h in the lithium grease and circulating air test. Finally those polyurethane materials, used as dust boots, are applied according to the criteria of ASTM, and DIN in order to preserve tie rod ends from outer factors for a long time. As a result, physical and aging values of these to polyurethane materials are assessed...|$|E

40|$|Background: Approximately 40 % of {{low back}} pain cases are {{attributed}} to internal disc disruption. Since mechanical loading directly affects intradiscal pressure and the stresses that the inner annulus fibrosus experiences, the mechanism that leads to disruption of the inner annulus fibrosus {{may be linked to}} changes in intradiscal pressure. Hence, {{there is a need to}} examine how intradiscal pressure changes over time during a flexion extension cyclic (FEC) loading protocol known to induce internal disc disruption. Purpose: 1) To determine whether a bore-screw pressure sensor system could be used as an alternative sensor for measuring intradiscal pressure, and 2) to characterize changes in intradiscal pressure, moments, and axial deformation using a FEC loading protocol. Study 1 summary: Technical specifications of the bore-screw pressure sensor system were compared to the <b>needle</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor. The error projected at a static compressive load of 1500 N was approximately eight percent and the bore-screw pressure sensor had an excellent dynamic response compared to the <b>needle</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor. Study 2 methods: The bore-screw pressure sensor system was successfully instrumented in 14 porcine specimens. The FEC loading protocol consisted of 3600 cycles of 1 Hz flexion-extension movement while applying a 1500 N compressive load. The four dependent variables collected were intradiscal pressure, moment, axial deformation, and angular displacement. Study 2 results: Intradiscal pressure and specimen height decreased by 45 % and 62 %, respectively, and the peak moment increased by 102 % following the FEC loading protocol. There were strong correlations between average intradiscal pressure and both peak moment and average axial deformation. The angle where maximum pressure occurred demonstrated a significant difference after 2700 cycles. There were no sequential changes in pressure difference after 2100 cycles. Twelve out of 14 specimens showed partial herniation (85. 7 %); however, the injury type was not correlated to the pressure change. Conclusions: Changes in intradiscal pressure were successfully characterized over time using a new pressure sensor system. Although the change in pressure difference was not predictive of an injury type, its increasing trend over time suggested that the inner annulus fibrosus failure mechanism may be related to fatigue. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the accuracy of measuring pressure with a fluid filled pressure device (needle) and a non-fluid filled pressure device (catheter) inside a thrombosed aneurysmal sac after exclusion from circulation by endovascular grafting. MethodsIn a static environment, consisting of a syringe to which a pressure monitoring kit was connected, experiments were performed to study the influence of the type of device (either needle or catheter) and the effect of the characteristics of the medium on the accuracy and reproducibility of pressure measurements. The pressures obtained with the needle in the different kinds of media were compared with those obtained in blood. Similar experiments were performed using a pressure catheter. Subsequently, pressure measurements were performed in a dynamic and physiological environment. This environment consisted of an artificial circulation in which an aneurysm, constructed of porcine aorta and filled with human aortic thrombus, was mounted. The pressures were compared and analyzed by Bland–Altman plots. ResultsUnder static conditions, the pressure levels obtained by a needle in blood, starch solution and thrombus were similar. Under identical conditions, pressures obtained by a catheter in starch solution were significant lower than the pressures measured in blood (P< 0. 05). Under dynamic pressure conditions the reproducibility of pressures obtained with the needle inserted in the human thrombus was very poor. ConclusionA <b>needle</b> <b>pressure</b> measuring device, inserted into media like human fibrin thrombus, does not yield accurate and reproducible results.

The technique of using a modified Schiotz tonometer was examined but rejected on grounds of inaccuracy, the need to perform the measurement with the infant in a vertical position, and the varying compressibility of the fontanelle.

40|$|A {{production}} common rail-type injector {{has been}} investigated via numerical simulation and experimentation. The functioning principle of the injector has been carefully analyzed so as to obtain a mathematical model of the device. A zero-dimensional approach {{has been used for}} modeling the injector, thus considering the variables as function of time only. The analysis of the hydraulic part of the injector resulted in the definition of an equivalent hydraulic scheme, on which basis both the equations of continuity in chambers and flow through nozzles were written. The connecting pipe between common rail and injector, as well as the injector internal line, were modeled according to a onedimensional approach. The moving mechanical components of the injector, such as <b>needle,</b> <b>pressure</b> rod, and control valve have been modeled using the mass-spring-damper scheme, thus obtaining the equation governing their motion. An electromagnetic model of the control valve solenoid has also been realized, in order to work out the attraction force on the anchor, generated by the electric current when flowing into its coil. The model obtained has been implemented using the MATLAB® toolbox SIMULINK®; the ordinary differential equations were solved by means of an implicit scheme of the second-order accuracy, suitable for problems with high level of stiffness, while the partial differential equations were integrated using the finite-difference Lax-Friedrichs method. The experimental investigation on the common-rail injection system was performed on a test bench at some standard test conditions. Electric current flowing through the injector coil, oil pressure in the common rail and at the injector inlet, injection rate, needle lift, and control valve lift were gauged and recorded during several injection phases. The mean reflux-flow rate and the mean quantity of fuel injected per stroke were also measured. Temperature and pressure of the feeding oil as well as pressure in the rail were continuously controlled during the experimental test. The numerical and experimental results were compared. Afterwards, the model was used to investigate the effect of control volume feeding and discharge holes and of their inlet fillet, as well as the effect of the control volume capacity, on the injector performance...|$|E
40|$|Epidural {{anesthesia}} is {{a commonly}} used anesthesia method during surgery or {{giving birth to}} a child. During the insertion of the needle {{in the back of}} the patient, the anesthetist has to interpret the different forces which requires extensive skills. To obtain these skills the residents train on patients, which is not without risk. Due to a lot of variation in anatomy of the human body, the identification of the tissues can be very difficult. An epidural anesthesia simulator can reduce this risk by offering anesthetists the opportunity to experience the differences in force and pressure feedback of the different tissues before moving on to patients. In literature only very little is available about needle-tissue interation around the epidural space. To collect data about tissue resistance during the insertion of an epidural needle, tests were done on living piglets. These animal tests were done at Erasmus MC, Rotterdam. During needle insertion, the position of the needle was captured along with the force on the needle and the pressure in the <b>needle.</b> <b>Pressure</b> measurements were used for the epidural space identification. The most important force feedback during the insertion is a force-peak which occurs by puncturing the ligamentum flavum. At the moment the needle tip enters the epidural space, a pressure-drop in the needle occurs which is the most important pressure feedback. The measured force-peak with a 18 G epidural needle can be described by an lognormal distribution and lies in the 68. 3 % confidence interval of 5. 45 till 11. 03 N and has an geometric mean of 7. 754 N. The distance between the force-peak event and the pressure-drop event can be described with a normal distribution with a mean of 1. 17 mm (s= 1. 217), where a positive value means that the force event occurs before the pressure-drop. The experimental results showed that there is no systematic difference in force peaks between piglets and neither between vertebrea. The measured pressure data showed that the pressure gradient is time-dependent when using a constant flow of liquid. Since it is unknown if an eventually ’tissue absorption’ ratio of the ligamentum flavum is velocity dependent, no valid statements can be done based on this data. Another observation was that the force-peaks measured in deceased tissue (1 - 5 h) are in the same range as the force-peaks in living tissue.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{definition}} of an accurate mathematical model of a production common-rail-type injector for automotive diesel engines. The mathematical model defined in a previous work was refined, accounting for {{a broader range of}} effects on injector performance, thus allowing a more strict validation of the model predictions against experimental data. The geometry of the control-valve holes, crucial in determining the actual discharge coefficient, was accurately evaluated by means of silicone molds. The moving mechanical components of the injector, such as control valve, needle, and pressure rod were modeled using the mass-spring-damper scheme. The axial deformation under pressure of <b>needle,</b> <b>pressure</b> rod, nozzle and injector body was modeled. This effect was found to also affect the control valve device operation, and was properly accounted for. The model obtained was implemented in Simulink; the ordinary differential equations were solved by means of the numerical differentiation formulas implicit scheme of second-order accuracy, while the partial differential equations were integrated using the finite-difference Lax-Friedrichs method. In order to obtain sufficient data for validating the model in its entire operation field, two separate sets of tests were carried out. In the first analysis, a constant reference pressure was imposed in the rail, and the injector energizing time was progressively increased from values relative to small pilot injections to values characteristic of large main injections. The injected volume per stroke was measured by means of a mean delivery meter (EMI) device. During the second set of tests, the injector was mounted on a flow rate meter (EVI) device so as to measure the injection law. Electric current flowing through the injector solenoid, oil pressure in the common rail, and at the injector inlet, needle, and control valve lift were also gauged and recorded. The good agreement between numerical and experimental results allowed the use of the model to gain greater insight into the mechanisms and phenomena that regulate injector behavior. The nozzle hole discharge coefficient dependence upon time and needle lift was discussed, and the trends were presented in several working conditions. The flow in the control volume holes was studied, in order to determine whether cavitation occurs or not, giving an answer to a long disputed topic. Finally, the effects of injector deformation caused by fuel pressure on performance were investigate...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAcupuncture, one of {{the primary}} methods of {{treatment}} in traditional Oriental medicine, is based on a system of meridians. Along the meridians lie acupuncture points or acupoints, which are stimulated by <b>needling,</b> <b>pressure</b> or heat to resolve a clinical problem. A number of methods have been used to identify meridians and to explain them anatomically. Thus, tendinomuscular structures, primo-vessels (Bonghan ducts), regions of increased temperature and low skin resistance have been suggested to represent meridians or as methods to identify them. However, n{{one of the}}se methods have met the criteria for a meridian, an entity that, when stimulated by acupuncture can result in clinical improvement. More recently, modern physiologists have put forward the “neural hypothesis” stating that the clinical influence of acupuncture is transmitted primarily through stimulation of sensory nerves that provide signals to the brain, which processes this information and then causes clinical changes associated with treatment. Although additional research is warranted to investigate the role of some of the structures identified, it seems clear that the peripheral and central nervous system can now be considered to be the most rational basis for defining meridians. The meridian maps and associated acupoints located along them are best viewed as road maps that can guide practitioners towards applying acupuncture to achieve optimal clinical results...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MscAgric (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Six non-lactating, ruminally {{cannulated}} Holstein cows {{were used}} in a three part study {{to determine the effect}} of biotin supplementation to dairy cows on forage fermentation characteristics. Cows were randomly assigned to two groups in a 2 x 3 change-over experiment. All cows received oat hay ad libitum and one of two concentrate feeds, fed twice daily at 2 kg per feeding as a top dressing. The concentrates were identical in composition, except for a premix that was included to provide either 0 or 40 mg supplemental biotin/cow per day when the concentrate was fed at a rate of 4 kg/cow. Cows received the respective treatments for 28 days before being changed over to the other treatment. All cows therefore received both treatments. The first 21 days in each period were used for adaptation, while the last 7 days of the period were used for an in sacco trial, {{as well as for the}} collection of rumen liquor for two in vitro studies. The in vitro studies were a gas production trial and an in vitro digestibility trial. Forages differing in neutral detergent fibre (NDF) content were used as substrates in the study. Lucerne hay (440 g NDF/kg DM), oat hay (680 g NDF/kg DM), and wheat straw (798 g NDF/kg DM) were chosen to represent high, medium and low quality forages. In the gas production study, samples (0. 5 g) of the three forages were incubated at 39 ºC in buffered rumen liquor (obtained from cows in the different treatments) in glass vials. Pressure readings were taken after 12, 18, 24, 30 and 48 hours incubation using a digital pressure gauge fitted with a 21 gauge <b>needle.</b> <b>Pressure</b> readings were converted to gas volumes with the aid of a predetermined regression equation. In the in vitro digestibility trial, forage samples (0. 25 g) were weighed into Ankom F 57 filter bags and incubated at 39 ºC in an Ankom Daisy II incubator in buffered rumen liquor. Three bags of each substrate were removed from the incubation jars after 18, 24 and 30 h incubation. Bag residues were analyzed for dry matter, organic matter and NDF. In the in sacco degradability trial, forage samples (5 g) were weighed into 100 x 200 mm Ankom Forage Bags and inserted into the rumina of the respective cow simultaneously. One bag per substrate was removed from each cow at after 4, 8, 18, 24, 30 and 48 h incubation, while two bags per substrate were removed after 72 and 96 h to ensure enough residue for subsequent chemical analysis. Samples of rumen liquor were taken at each of the mentioned incubation times for VFA analysis, while rumen pH was also measured at these times. All the data collected were subjected to a one-way ANOVA, least square means were determined and significance was declared at P< 0. 05. Biotin supplementation increased the rate of gas production (0 - 12 h) of all three substrates, as well as cumulative gas production at 48 h. No treatment effects were observed in the in vitro digestion study. Biotin supplementation increased the rate of in sacco NDF disappearance and calculated effective NDF degradability in oat hay and wheat straw, but not in lucerne hay. The rumen pH curve appeared higher for the biotin treatment than for the control and the value at the 72 h sampling time was significantly higher for the biotin treatment than for the control treatment (6. 13 vs 5. 94). Rumen pH tended to be higher (P< 0. 10) at 18 h (6. 44 vs 6. 23), 48 h (6. 13 vs 6. 00) and 96 h (6. 14 vs 6. 04). There was also a tendency (P< 0. 10) for the mean pH over the total 96 h period to be higher for the biotin treatment than for the control (6. 09 vs 5. 97), while the maximum and minimum pH values did not differ between treatments. Molar proportions of volatile fatty acids did not differ between treatments and the acetic acid proportion was relatively high (acetic:propionic = 74 : 15), which was probably because the cows were not on a very high concentrate diet. It was concluded that biotin supplementation to dairy cows may improve fermentation rates and NDF digestibility of certain forages...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMany {{factors such}} as the size and type of <b>needle</b> and {{negative}} <b>pressure</b> can affect the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). However, because many biases exist in clinical studies of humans, particularly in terms of individual differences among participants, results are largely dependent on the characteristics of the patients and tumors. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the properties of EUS-FNA needles and aspiration techniques using animal and artificial models under stable conditions. MethodsWe performed EUS-FNA on a pig liver under general anesthesia in Protocol 1. We used all types (soft-type, stiff-type, and reverse-beveled needles) and all sizes of <b>needles</b> with negative <b>pressure</b> applied using a 20 -mL syringe or the slow-pull technique. All the obtained specimens were fixed in formalin for the cell block method. The specimens were scored according to the our own grading system. In Protocol 2, EUS-FNA was performed using three materials: Japanese sweet bean jelly, tofu, and cow liver. The obtained specimens were placed on the dish one by one. The FNA specimens were evaluated macroscopically and compared with each other. ResultsIn Protocol 1, the mean ± standard deviation score for reverse-beveled needles (4. 1  ±  1. 41) was significantly higher than that for soft-type needles (3. 5  ±  1. 79; P <  0. 05, Dunn's test). However, there was no significant difference between stiff-type and reverse-beveled needles. The score for each size of needle showed no significant difference, even between 25 gauge (G) and 19 G. Comparing the slow-pull technique with 20 -mL negative pressure, the slow-pull technique provided a small specimen but less blood in Protocol 2. Negative pressure was not useful for EUS-FNA of a hard tumor model. ConclusionThe score for the reverse-beveled needle was better than that of the soft-type needle. The slow-pull technique may be useful for a bloody tumor, but it provides less specimen. We should select the EUS-FNA method based on the relevant patient and tumor characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Background Shockwave {{treatment}} is increasingly used for plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendinopathy. To be effective {{it is believed}} that high pressure must be achieved in the tissues. We report on the first human cadaveric experiments to characterize pressure from radial shockwave therapy (rSWT) for plantar fasciitis. Methods The pressure from rSWT was measured in two cadaveric feet using a <b>needle</b> hydrophone. Maximal <b>pressure</b> and energy flux were calculated from the measurements. Results The pressure persisted longer than supposed, for up to 400  μs. The peak negative pressure was up to two Mega Pascal. The predicted energy in the tissue strongly depended on the time interval used in calculations. Conclusions The measured pressure may be sufficiently high to cause cavitation in the tissue, {{which is one of the}} proposed healing mechanisms associated with rSWT. The results suggest that the energy is imparted to the tissues for much longer than previously thought...|$|R

40|$|A. Equipment Two {{pieces of}} {{equipment}} are needed {{to gain access to}} the abdomen: an insuf-flator and a Veress needle (or Hasson cannula, see Section C). 1. Insufflator Turn the insufflator on and check the carbon dioxide (CO 2) cylinder to ascer-tain that it contains sufficient gas to complete the procedure. If there is any doubt, bring an extra CO 2 container into the operating room. In any event, always keep a spare tank of CO 2 immediately available. Check the insufflator to assure it is functioning properly. Connect the sterile insufflation tubing (with in-line filter) to the insufflator. Turn the insuf-flator to high flow (> 6 L/min); with the insufflator tubing not yet connected to a Veress <b>needle,</b> the intra-abdominal <b>pressure</b> indicator should register 0 (Fig. 2. 1). Lower the insufflator flow rate to 1 L/min. Kink the tubing to shut off the flow of gas. The pressure indicator should rapidly rise to 30 mmHg and flo...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{modelling}} of a research type Heavy Duty Common Rail (CR) fuel injection system. More specifically it reports on the observed interaction between fuel properties and injection and on the capability to model this. For that reason a hydraulic model of the fuel injection system has been developed using the AMESim code (Imagine S. A., 2003). The reliability of the numerical results is tested through a comparison between numerical and experimental results when using regular diesel fuel. Basis for this detailed comparison are measurements of injected mass flow rate, <b>needle</b> lift and <b>pressure</b> oscillations in the injection duct for a single injection. Simulation results for regular diesel show good agreement with measured data for pressure oscillations in the injection duct, needle lift and injected fuel mass flow rate. A comparison of experimental and simulated results for Rapeseed oil Methyl Ester (RME) also shows good correspondence, which proves the capability of the model to capture the influence of different fuel properties...|$|R
