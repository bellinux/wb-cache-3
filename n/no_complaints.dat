5|$|A {{total of}} 65 ABC affiliates—28% of the network—did not clear the {{available}} timeslot for the film, {{even with the}} offer of The Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent, to pay all fines for language to the Federal Communications Commission. In the end, however, <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> were lodged against ABC affiliates who showed Ryan, perhaps because even conservative watchdogs like the Parents Television Council supported the unedited rebroadcast of the film. Additionally, some ABC affiliates in other markets that were near affected markets, such as Youngstown, Ohio, ABC affiliate WYTV (which is viewable {{in parts of the}} Columbus, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh markets, none of which aired the film) and Gainesville, Florida, ABC affiliate WCJB-TV (which is viewable in parts of the Orlando and Tampa markets), still aired the film and gave those nearby markets the option of viewing the film. TNT and Turner Classic Movies have also broadcast the film.|$|E
5|$|Playford {{retired from}} Parliament with a pension of $72 a week; he had {{resisted}} giving higher pensions to Ministers or longer-serving MPs throughout his tenure. Regardless {{of what people}} thought of the Playmander, Playford was held in high regard for his integrity; during his premiership, there were <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> of corruption or government largesse. Playford also prohibited his ministers from sitting {{on the board of}} directors of public companies or owning shares, lest they became conflicted in their decision-making. He returned to his orchard at Norton Summit, and took a continued interest in South Australian politics, but did not typically raise his opinions publicly; he was still consulted in private by Liberals up until his death, however. His closeness to Labor figures did not end either, offering advice to their new South Australian ministers, and assisting in a memorial to the former Labor Prime Minister John Curtin. In line with his reputation for promoting his state, Playford also privately lobbied the Liberal government in Canberra on behalf of the state Labor administration for more infrastructure funding. In 1977, when Don Dunstan celebrated his 50th birthday party, Playford was the only Liberal invited. There he socialised with former and future Labor Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke, Dunstan, and other Laborites.|$|E

The aircraft had received regular maintenance and servicing, {{and there were}} <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> of mechanical difficulty.

25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether I {{could make the}} film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, and I said I could not. You will not believe this, but the day the film was released, I saw the same judge coming towards me and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have <b>no</b> <b>complaints.</b>|$|E
25|$|To counter those claims, Rosas {{arranged}} {{a meeting with}} diplomats from the United States, Portugal, Sardinia, Bolivia and France. The British diplomat refused to assist, but the French Mareuil did so. All of them declared unanimously that they had <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> about the treatment to foreigners, {{that they had no}} knowledge of foreigners forced by terror into the military or to sign petitions, that they had no knowledge of abuses from the Mazorca, and that the information of alleged butcheries in India Muerta was inexact. Rosas included as well a petition signed by 15 000 British and French living in Buenos Aires, protesting against the blockade. Rosas was confident in that this formal declaration, signed by foreign diplomats, would counter the Montevidean propaganda and turn the international opinion to his side.|$|E

25|$|In {{the trials}} {{described}} above, the only common predictor of SVR among all three was {{the treatment of}} HCV other than type 1.6-8 In the trial by Chung et al., patient characteristics that predicted an SVR were treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin, absence of prior drug abuse, a detectable level of HIV-1 RNA, and a Karnofsky score of 100. The Karnofsky score is a subjective measure of how well the patient is doing. A score of 100 indicates that the patient has <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> or evidence of disease, a score of 50 indicates that the patient requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care, and a score of 0 indicates that the patient is dead. In the study by Carrat et al., no protease inhibitor therapy, an age of 40 years or younger, or a baseline alanine aminotransferase greater {{than three times the}} upper limit of normal predicted a sustained virological response. In the study by Torrani et al., SVR was predicted by HCV genotype other than 1 and a baseline HCV RNA level of 800,000 IU or less per milliliter.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers noted a {{significant}} amount of crude and vulgar humor in [...] "Terrance and Philip in Not Without My Anus", even by South Park standards; The Sydney Morning Herald noted the episode contained 29 separate fart jokes in the span of 22 minutes. Global Television Network in Canada reported <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> about the episode in the weeks after its release.|$|E
500|$|After {{the trial}} began, Skippon warned media outlets {{that it was}} illegal to use the film without written permission. The {{director}} wrote to The Independent that <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> were made against Harris during {{the making of the}} film. In an article about the allegations against Harris, The Sunday Telegraph noted that Kids Can Say No! was commissioned by the NSPCC; a NSPCC spokesperson responded, [...] "The film was made independently by Rolf Harris and a film company nearly 30 years ago... We did not commission it, fund it, make it or distribute it".|$|E

500|$|Celtic's attacking style {{play against}} Internazionale's catenaccio was heralded as a win for football. Internazionale manager Helenio Herrera said that [...] "We can have <b>no</b> <b>complaints.</b> Celtic {{deserved}} their victory. We were beaten by Celtic's force. Although we lost, the match {{was a victory}} for sport." [...] while one Portuguese official said [...] "This attacking play, {{this is the real}} meaning of football. This is the true game.". The Portuguese newspaper, Mundo Desportivo, said [...] "It was inevitable. Sooner or later the Inter of Herrera, the Inter of catenaccio, of negative football, of marginal victories, had to pay for their refusal to play entertaining football." ...|$|E
500|$|Graham offered <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> {{and told}} reporters: [...] "I thought they played very well. We just didn't finish them off. It's a thin {{dividing}} line between success and failure." [...] He went on to call the defeat his [...] "lowest moment in football." [...] Wrexham midfielder Davies accused Arsenal of underestimating their opponents and felt their unrest at having conceded the equaliser worked to the home side's advantage: [...] "I {{thought they were going}} to be a lot more professional when they were leading and tighten it up. They treated it as a training match. We've got a team of youngsters and two old men and perhaps our desire to win was greater than theirs." ...|$|E
500|$|Sense and Sensibility {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. However, the Jane Austen Society criticised it for being [...] "too raunchy" [...] and accused Davies of [...] "degrading fine English literature", after he included a seduction {{scene in the}} opening episode. The chairman of the society, Patrick Stokes, stated, [...] "Sexing this story up says more about the BBC than Jane Austen. It is lowering itself by degrading fine English literature {{in the battle for}} ratings. While it is good that it draws people's attention to her works, there is not a lot you can do if someone makes a hash of it." [...] A BBC spokesman believed the drama was not overtly sexual and stated that they had received <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> about it, though they did get several calls from viewers expressing their appreciation for the series.|$|E

500|$|In their {{review of}} the game, GameSpot called the music [...] "catchy and eclectic", though they disapproved {{of the amount of}} reused tracks from {{previous}} Katamari games. IGN was more ambivalent, saying that while they had <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> about the music, they also saw [...] "nothing to really praise either". Square Enix Music Online, in their {{review of the}} album, said that the album's [...] "lack of humorous vocal tracks and high quality experimental instrumentals" [...] meant that it did not match up to the previous soundtracks in the series. They additionally felt that the second disc did not add much to the album, and that on the whole the new Me & My Katamari tracks were not strong or numerous enough to make the purchase worthwhile. Unlike the previous two soundtracks in the series, the soundtrack to Me & My Katamari did not win any awards.|$|E
500|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the best}} PlayStation 2 and action games of all time, God of War II {{received}} critical acclaim, with aggregate scores of 92.79% from GameRankings and 93 out of 100 from Metacritic, who describe their score as [...] "universal acclaim". It has been praised for its story and improvements over its predecessor, such as gameplay and graphics. Chris Roper of IGN said that God of War II is [...] "one of gaming's most intense and engaging experiences available." [...] He said it [...] "is practically devoid" [...] of the minor flaws of the original, citing an example that players can now quickly navigate wall climbing, such as being able to vertically slide down walls. Furthering his praise of the gameplay, he said that it is one of the most [...] "polished and refined experiences...in gaming." [...] Although he said that the combat mechanics were practically identical to the original, he had <b>no</b> <b>complaints,</b> stating it is [...] "for good reason as it was already perfect the first time out." ...|$|E
500|$|United {{created the}} first {{significant}} opportunity of the game, around the midway point of the first half, when a header from Steve Bruce was inadvertently cleared by his own teammate McClair in the Arsenal goal. In the meantime, Arsenal manager George Graham spotted that the marking in midfield was poor and instructed Limpar and Rocastle to push forward, while striker Paul Merson was given a deeper role to follow Mike Phelan. Arsenal took the lead two minutes before half-time; Limpar made a run across United's penalty area to receive Paul Davis' corner from the right hand side. United [...] "clearly believed this was a dummy run", hence why Phelan {{made no attempt to}} challenge. Davis passed the ball short to Limpar, who turned and curled it goalwards into the penalty area with his left foot. Although goalkeeper Les Sealey [...] "did well {{to get down to the}} ball", he was unable to hold it; referee Keith Hackett deemed the ball to have crossed the goal line and gave the goal. Ferguson offered <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> about Hackett's decision afterwards: [...] "The video showed quite clearly the referee was right and the ball crossed the line." ...|$|E

500|$|SFScope's Sarah Stegall {{praised the}} writers for {{showcasing}} Peter, believing Jackson gave [...] "a solid, convincing performance that teaches {{us more about}} Peter than we learned {{in the first half}} of this season". She also was pleased with Peter's reactions to the obstacles thrown in his path, but criticized the writing for having another man behind the murders ('Too much coincidence. Way too much coincidence. From a plotting standpoint, it was clumsy'). Stegall concluded her review by praising all of the actors' performances, explaining that other than the [...] "clumsy" [...] killer plot twist, [...] "I had <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> at all about this episode. The supporting cast was top notch". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly enjoyed how the episode mystery was processed from Peter's point of view, and loved the revelation at the end about Walternate. MTV columnist Josh Wigler praised the episode's [...] "pretty mature storytelling" [...] for not making Peter [...] "go on an angry rampage" [...] or become [...] "an angsty ball of self-loathing" [...] after the previous episode's events. He continued, [...] "You can see that he's hurting, but he's still not quite sure how to process everything. Excellent work from the writers and Joshua Jackson".|$|E
500|$|The Third Circuit Court heard oral {{arguments}} in the appeals on May 17, 2007, at the United States Courthouse in Philadelphia. The appeal panel consisted of Chief Judge Anthony Joseph Scirica, Judge Thomas Ambro, and Judge Robert Cowen. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sought to reinstate the sentence of death, {{on the basis that}} Yohn's ruling was flawed, as he should have deferred to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which had already ruled on the issue of sentencing, and the Batson claim was invalid because Abu-Jamal made <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> during the original jury selection. Although Abu-Jamal's jury was racially mixed, with 2 blacks and 10 whites {{at the time of his}} unanimous conviction, his counsel told the Third Circuit Court that Abu-Jamal did not get a fair trial because the jury was racially biased, misinformed, and the judge was a racist. He noted that the prosecution used eleven out of fourteen peremptory challenges to eliminate prospective black jurors. Terri Maurer-Carter, a former Philadelphia court stenographer, claimed in a 2001 affidavit nearly 20 years after the trial that she overheard Judge Sabo say [...] "Yeah, and I'm going to help them fry the nigger" [...] in the course of a conversation with three people present regarding Abu-Jamal's case. Sabo denied having made any such comment.|$|E
500|$|The death verdict against Kesselring {{unleashed}} {{a storm of}} protest in the United Kingdom. Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill immediately branded it as too harsh and intervened in favour of Kesselring. Field Marshal Alexander, now Governor General of Canada, sent a telegram to Prime Minister Clement Attlee in which he expressed his hope that Kesselring's sentence would be commuted. [...] "As his old opponent on the battlefield", he stated, [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>complaints</b> against him. Kesselring and his soldiers fought against us hard but clean." [...] Alexander had expressed his admiration for Kesselring as a military commander as early as 1943. In his 1961 memoirs Alexander paid tribute to Kesselring as a commander who [...] "showed great skill in extricating himself from the desperate situations into which his faulty intelligence had led him". Alexander's sentiments were echoed by Lieutenant General Sir Oliver Leese, who had commanded the British Eighth Army in the Italian campaign. In a May 1947 interview, Leese said he was [...] "very sad" [...] to hear of what he considered [...] "British victor's justice" [...] being imposed on Kesselring, an [...] "extremely gallant soldier who had fought his battles fairly and squarely". Lord de L'Isle, who had been awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry at Anzio, raised {{the issue in the}} House of Lords.|$|E
