5|$|Peter McConnell {{announced}} that the game's soundtrack would be fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra for the remastered version of the game being released in 2015. After the original Pro Tools sound files were recovered, McConnell found {{that some of the}} samples he had used originally did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> good, and the team opted to re-orchestrate the score.|$|E
5|$|Tornado {{warnings}} were {{in effect}} {{at the time}} and issued on average about 30 minutes before the tornado hit, but few people were alerted as many were asleep as the tornado hit in the overnight hours. The local NOAA Weather Radio transmitter was experiencing technical difficulties at the time, causing some weather radios to <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> an alarm. Damages were estimated at around $85 million.|$|E
5|$|Chris Brandkamp {{produced}} most of {{the ambient}} and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp {{had to wait until}} the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway, because recordings of actual fire did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.|$|E

She returned to Iraq on February 11, with no acknowledgement from WikiLeaks that they had received the files.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> like its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
5|$|Voice casting was {{managed by}} Kris Zimmerman, who chose voice actors {{that seemed to}} suit certain roles: the Matoran were voiced by young adults, while the Turaga were voiced by older actors. The voice actors and their {{performances}} were chosen so they would <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> like they came from a specific area of the world, instead sound like they came from and belonged in the Bionicle universe. A notable event during recording was a behind-the-scenes incident between Michas and Francis: originally cast in the respective roles of Jaller and Takua, Michas came into a recording session in a muddled state and began reading Takua's lines by mistake. When Francis came in, he read Jaller's lines: when the staff heard them and were favourably impressed, the actors permanently switched roles. Voice acting for the project was mostly done in 2002, but dialogue was re-recorded during Additional Dialogue Recording (ADR) into 2003: approximately 30% of the final film's dialogue was done during ADR. Audio and music post-production was handled by Hacienda Post. The company's president Tim Borquez served as sound supervisor. Mask of Light {{was the first time}} in any media that Bionicle characters spoke.|$|E

50|$|A {{case has}} been {{registered}} against officials of the Larji Hydroelectric Project and College for causing the death of 24 engineering students through negligence.

5|$|The track {{had been}} patched up {{prior to the}} weekend's racing using a {{synthetic}} rubber compound, and it had remained secure throughout the practice and qualifying sessions, {{as well as the}} Grand-Am and Indy Lights races. However, the Dallara DW12's aerodynamic ground force effects acted to pull the compound out. After assessing the track conditions, {{the decision was made to}} attempt to repair the track and restart the race. Marshalls and track workers started to pull the loose strips up from the track, and a quick drying concrete was used to fill the troughs. The repairs were held up for a short time when a crew was despatched to collect more of the concrete, as the on-site resources had been used up, but eventually the race director was happy the race could restart. Kanaan and Power drove around to survey the repairs, acting as driver representatives, and although Kanaan particularly did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> confident that they would hold up, they agreed to try and continue racing. There was some confusion about the rules of the restart; no repairs were allowed, and the teams could change tires, but had to remain on the same compound. This led to J.R. Hildebrand suffering a one lap penalty as his car required repair work, and a number of drivers being angered at having to stay on the harder tires, which were the slower compound.|$|E

25|$|If {{the reader}} has also {{received}} {{the benefit of}} the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.|$|E
25|$|After the September 11 attacks, Hanjour's {{family in}} Saudi Arabia vehemently {{stated that they}} could not, and would not, believe he had been {{involved}} {{as one of the}} hijacker pilots, and also stated that he had phoned them just eight hours prior to the hijackings and his voice did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> strange or unusual at all.|$|E

25|$|Local dialectical {{readings}} of kanji are also classified under kun'yomi, most notably readings for words in Ryukyuan languages. Further, {{in rare cases}} gairaigo (borrowed words) have a single character associated with them, in which case this reading is formally classified as a kun'yomi, because the character is being used for meaning, <b>not</b> <b>sound.</b> This is discussed under single character gairaigo, below.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the station again became an {{important}} outlet for new Canadian music, with bands such as Barenaked Ladies, The Lowest of the Low, Rheostatics, and Sloan counting CFNY as their first major radio supporter. Unfortunately for the station's influence, alternative rock became the decade's dominant genre and so CFNY did <b>not</b> <b>sound</b> as distinctive compared to other radio stations as it once had.|$|E
