The experiments involved varying the peak deviation and measuring the bit error probability (BEP) at various signal energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratios (E(b) /N(o)). The experiments showed that the optimum <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>deviation</b> was about 0. 7 to 0. 8 times the – 3 dB IF bandwidth and that the E(b) /N(o) required for a given BEP increased as the ratio of IF bandwidth to bit rate increased.

40|$|High-throughput optical {{communication}} systems utilize binary soft-decision {{forward error correction}} (SD-FEC) with bit interleaving over the bit channels. The generalized mutual information (GMI) is an achievable information rate (AIR) in such systems and {{is known to be}} a good predictor of the bit error rate after SD-FEC decoding (post-FEC BER) for uniform signaling. However, for probabilistically shaped (nonuniform) signaling, we find that the normalized AIR, defined as the AIR divided by the signal entropy, is less correlated with the post-FEC BER. We show that the information quantity based on the distribution of the single bit signal, and its asymmetric log-likelihood ratio, are better predictors of the post-FEC BER. In simulations over the Gaussian channel, we find that the prediction accuracy, quantified as the <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>deviation</b> of the post-FEC BER within a set of different modulation formats and distributions, can be improved more than 1 0 times compared with the normalized AIR...|$|R
40|$|Onroad CO 2 {{emissions}} {{were analyzed}} {{as part of}} overall GHG emissions, but those studies have suffered from {{one or more of}} these five shortcomings: 1) the spatial resolution was coarse, usually encompassing a region, or the entire U. S.; 2) the temporal resolution was coarse (annual or monthly); 3) the study region was limited, usually a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) or state; 4) fuel sales were used as a proxy to quantify fuel consumption instead of focusing on travel; 5) the spatial heterogeneity of fleet and road network composition was not considered and instead national averages are used. ^ Normalized vehicle-type state-level spatial biases range from 2. 6 % to 8. 1 %, while the road type classification biases range from - 6. 3 % to 16. 8 %. These biases are found to cause errors in reduction estimates as large as ± 60 %, corresponding to ± 0. 2 MtC, for a national-average emissions mitigation strategy focused on a 10 % emissions reduction from a single vehicle class. ^ Temporal analysis shows distinct emissions seasonality that is particularly visible in the northernmost latitudes, demonstrating <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>deviations</b> from the annual mean of up to 50 %. The hourly structure shows <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>deviation</b> from a weekly average of up to 200 % for heavy-duty (HD) vehicles and 140 % for light-duty (LD) vehicles. ^ The present study focuses on reduction of travel and fuel economy improvements by putting forth several mitigation scenarios aimed at reducing VMT and increasing vehicle fuel efficiency. It was found that the most effective independent reduction strategies are those that increase fuel efficiency by extending standards proposed by the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) or reduction of fuel consumption due to price increases. These two strategies show cumulative emissions reductions of approximately 11 % and 12 %, respectively, from a business as usual (BAU) approach over the 2000 - 2050 period. ^ The U. S. onroad transportation sector is long overdue a comprehensive study of CO 2 emissions at a highly resolved level. Such a study would improve fossil fuel flux products by enhancing measurement accuracy and prompt location-specific mitigation policy. The carbon cycle science and policymaking communities are both poised to benefit greatly from the development of a highly resolved spatiotemporal emissions product. ...|$|R
40|$|We numerically {{work out}} {{the impact of the}} general {{relativistic}} Lense-Thirring effect on the Earth-Mercury range caused by the gravitomagnetic field of the rotating Sun. The peak-to peak nominal amplitude of the resulting time-varying signal amounts to 1. 75 10 ^ 1 m over a temporal interval 2 yr. Future interplanetary laser ranging facilities should reach a cm-level in ranging to Mercury over comparable timescales; for example, the BepiColombo mission, to be launched in 2014, should reach a 4. 5 - 10 cm level over 1 - 8 yr. We looked also at other Newtonian (solar quadrupole mass moment, ring of the minor asteroids, Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, Trans-Neptunian Objects) and post-Newtonian (gravitoelectric Schwarzschild solar field) dynamical effects on the Earth-Mercury range. They act as sources of systematic errors for the Lense-Thirring signal which, in turn, if not properly modeled, may bias the recovery of some key parameters of such other dynamical features of motion. Their <b>nominal</b> <b>peak-to-peak</b> amplitudes are as large as 4 10 ^ 5 m (Schwarzschild), 3 10 ^ 2 m (Sun's quadrupole), 8 10 ^ 1 m (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta), 4 m (ring of minor asteroids), 8 10 ^- 1 m (Trans-Neptunian Objects). Their temporal patterns are different with respect to that of the gravitomagnetic signal. Comment: LaTex 2 e, 19 pages, 2 tables, 6 figures.

The receiving system in common use employs an FM limiter/discriminator as a detector followed by an integrate and dump matched filter for bit detection. This system has been studied by previous authors [1] and {{it is well known}} that in the absence of frequency uncertainty the optimum transmission parameters consist of a modulation index of. 7 (<b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>deviation</b> divided by the bit rate) and an IF filter bandwidth equal to the bit rate followed by a limiter discriminator. In many cases, there is a need for some small amount of analog telemetry transmission in addition to the digital data discussed above. In these cases it is common practice to include analog subcarriers on the main carrier with the digital data modulating the carrier at baseband, the resulting system is called PCM/FM + FM/FM. These hybrid analog/digital systems are the subject of this paper. In particular this paper addresses the performance of these systems through simulation using the Block Oriented System Simulator (BOSS) from Comdisco and with analytical techniques to obtain the BER versus SNR curves for these systems. The simulation is used over a wide range of parameters to find the optimum values of modulation index and IF bandwidth for these systems...|$|R
40|$|Operation of in situ space assets, such as rovers and landers, {{requires}} {{operators to}} acquire {{a thorough understanding of}} the environment surrounding the spacecraft. The following programs help with that understanding by providing higher-level information characterizing the surface, which is not immediately obvious by just looking at the XYZ terrain data. This software suite covers three primary programs: marsuvw, marsrough, and marsslope, and two secondary programs, which together use XYZ data derived from in situ stereo imagery to characterize the surface by determining surface normal, surface roughness, and various aspects of local slope, respectively. These programs all use the Planetary Image Geometry (PIG) library to read mission-specific data files. The programs themselves are completely multimission; all mission dependencies are handled by PIG. The input data consists of images containing XYZ locations as derived by, e. g., marsxyz. The marsuvw program determines surface normals from XYZ data by gathering XYZ points from an area around each pixel and fitting a plane to those points. Outliers are rejected, and various consistency checks are applied. The result shows the orientation of the local surface at each point as a unit vector. The program can be run in two modes: standard, which is typically used for in situ arm work, and slope, which is typically used for rover mobility. The difference is primarily due to optimizations necessary for the larger patch sizes in the slope case. The marsrough program determines surface roughness in a small area around each pixel, which is defined as the maximum <b>peak-to-peak</b> <b>deviation</b> from the plane perpendicular to the surface normal at that pixel. The marsslope program takes a surface normal file as input and derives one of several slope-like outputs from it. The outputs include slope, slope rover direction (a measure of slope radially away from the rover), slope heading, slope magnitude, northerly tilt, and solar energy (compares the slope with the Sun s location at local noon). The marsuvwproj program projects a surface normal onto an arbitrary plane in space, resulting in a normalized 3 D vector, which is constrained to lie in the plane. The marsuvwrot program rotates the vectors in a surface normal file, generating a new surface normal file. It also can change coordinate systems for an existing surface normal file. While the algorithms behind this suite are not particularly unique, what makes the programs useful is their integration into the larger in situ image processing system via the PIG library. They work directly with space in situ data, understanding the appropriate image metadata fields and updating them properly. The secondary programs (marsuvwproj, marsuvwrot) were originally developed to deal with anomalous situations on Opportunity and Spirit, respectively, but may have more general applicability...|$|R
40|$|Averages {{taken over}} full orbit data spans of the {{pitch and roll}} {{residual}} measurement errors of the two conical Earth sensors operating on the LANDSAT 4 spacecraft are described. The variability of these full orbit averages over representative data throughtout the year is analyzed to demonstrate the long term stability of the sensor measurements. The data analyzed consist of 23 segments of sensor measurements made at 2 to 4 week intervals. Each segment is roughly 24 hours in length. The variation of full orbit average {{as a function of}} orbit within a day as a function of day of year is examined. The dependence on day of year is based on association the start date of each segment with the mean full orbit average for the segment.

Additionally, we introduce the ensemble median algorithm EMMA combining individual soundings of the seven algorithms into one new data set. The ensemble takes advantage of the algorithms' independent developments. We find ensemble spreads being often < 1 ppm but rising up to 2 ppm especially in the tropics and East Asia. On the basis of gridded monthly averages, we compare EMMA and all individual algorithms with TCCON and CarbonTracker model results (potential outliers, north/south gradient, seasonal (<b>peak-to-peak)</b> amplitude, standard <b>deviation</b> of the difference). Our findings show that EMMA is a promising candidate for inverse modeling studies.

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61205103, 61405211]FM-to-AM {{modulation}} is {{an important}} effect in {{the front end of}} high-power lasers that influences the temporal profile. Various methods have been implemented in standard-fiber and polarization-maintaining (PM) -fiber front ends to suppress the FM-to-AM modulation. To analyze the modulation in the front end, a theoretical model is established and detailed simulations carried out that show that the polarizing (PZ) fiber, whose fast axis has a large loss, can successfully suppress the modulation. Moreover, the stability of the FM-to-AM modulation can be improved, which is important for the front end to obtain a stable output. To verify the model, a PZ fiber front end is constructed experimentally. The FM-to-AM modulation, without any compensation, is less than 4 %, whereas that of the PM fiber front end with the same structure is nearly 20 %. The stability of the FM-to-AM modulation depth is analyzed experimentally and the <b>peak-to-peak</b> and standard <b>deviation</b> (SD) are 2 % and 0. 38 %, respectively, over 3 h. The experimental results agree with the simulation results and both prove that the PZ fiber front end can successfully suppress the FM-to-AM conversion. The PZ fiber front end is a promising alternative for improving the performance of the front end in high-power laser facilities. (C) 2016 Optical Society of Americ...|$|R
40|$|Intraoperative neurophysiologic {{monitoring}} is {{an integral}} part of spinal surgeries and involves the recording of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). However, clinical application of IONM still requires anywhere between 200 to 2000 trials to obtain an SSEP signal, which is excessive and introduces a significant delay during surgery to detect a possible neurological damage. The aim of this study is to develop a means to obtain the SSEP using a much less, twelve number of recordings. The preliminary step involved was to distinguish the SSEP with the ongoing brain activity. We first establish that the brain activity is indeed quasi-stationary whereas an SSEP is expected to be identical every time a trial is recorded. An algorithm was developed using Chebychev time windowing for preconditioning of SSEP trials to retain the morphological characteristics of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). This preconditioning was followed by the application of a principal component analysis (PCA) -based algorithm utilizing quasi-stationarity of EEG on 12 preconditioned trials. A unique Walsh transform operation was then used to identify the position of the SSEP event. An alarm is raised when there is a 10 % time in latency deviation and/or 50 % <b>peak-to-peak</b> amplitude <b>deviation,</b> as per the clinical requirements. The algorithm shows consistency in the results in monitoring SSEP in up to 6 -hour surgical procedures even under this significantly reduced number of trials. In this study, the analysis was performed on the data recorded in 29 patients undergoing surgery during which the posterior tibial nerve was stimulated and SSEP response was recorded from scalp. This method is shown empirically to be more clinically viable than present day approaches. In all 29 cases, the algorithm takes 4 sec to extract an SSEP signal, as compared to conventional methods, which take several minutes. The monitoring process using the algorithm was successful and proved conclusive under the clinical constraints throughout the different surgical procedures with an accuracy of 91. 5 %. Higher accuracy and faster execution time, observed in the present study, in determining the SSEP signals provide a much improved and effective neurophysiological monitoring process. ...|$|R
