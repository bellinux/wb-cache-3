The Canadiens stocked their team with francophone stars including Newsy Lalonde, Georges Poulin and Didier Pitre. Before being allowed to play, Pitre had to resolve a lawsuit with the Montreal Nationals, to whom he was already under contract.|$|E

500|$|I try <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
2500|$|... 19 September 1903 Scientific American {{reported}} Whitehead made {{powered glider}} flights in a triplane machine towed by an assistant pulling a rope: [...] "By {{running with the}} machine against the wind after the motor had been started, the aeroplane was made to skim along above the ground at heights of from 3 to 16 feet for a distance, without the operator touching, of about 350 yards. It was possible to have traveled a much longer distance, without the operator touching terra firma, but for the operator's desire <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> far above it. Although the motor was not developing its full power, owing to the speed not exceeding 1,000 R.P.M., it developed sufficient to move the machine against the wind." [...] The article said a [...] two-cycle motor powered a two-bladed [...] diameter tractor propeller. The engine shown in the article was exhibited by Whitehead at the Second Annual Exhibit of the Aero Club of America in December 1906.|$|E

50|$|The Cobequid Acadians {{were close}} to an Indian mission located where the Stewiacke meets the Shubenacadie; and which had been run, for many years, by Le Loutre.

[...] Indeed, the album's lyrics maintain P.O.D.'s common themes of spiritual preservation; however, Payable on Death deemphasizes the upbeat urban rocks anthems of their past.

60|$|For a {{few minutes}} he watched it from the top rail of the old fence. Then he scurried {{down to the ground}} and, a few steps at a time, {{stopping}} to watch sharply between each little run, he drew nearer and nearer to that queer acting string. It gave him a funny feeling inside to see a string acting like that, so he was very careful <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> near. He looked at it from one side, then ran around and looked at it from the other side. At last he got where he could see that one end of the string was under an old board, and then he began to understand. Of course there was somebody hiding under that old board and jerking the string.|$|E
60|$|The audacious {{should not}} complain. A mere trader {{ought not to}} grumble at the tolls levied by a mighty king. His mightiness was {{sometimes}} very overwhelming; but even when you had to defy him openly, as {{on the banks of}} the Agulhas homeward bound from the East Indies, or on the outward passage round the Horn, he struck at you fairly his stinging blows (full in the face, too), and it was your business <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> much staggered. And, after all, if you showed anything of a countenance, the good-natured barbarian would let you fight your way past the very steps of his throne. It was only now and then that the sword descended and a head fell; but if you fell you were sure of impressive obsequies and of a roomy, generous grave.|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} the tree where Hooty was, he was {{blinking}} his great yellow eyes and had fluffed out all his feathers, which is a way he has when he is angry, to make himself look twice as big as he really is. Of course, {{he had heard the}} noisy crew coming, and he knew well enough what to expect. As soon as they saw him, they began to scream as loud as ever they could and to call him all manner of names. The boldest of them would dart at him as if to pull out a mouthful of feathers, but took the greatest care <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>too</b> near. You see, the way Hooty hissed and snapped his great bill was very threatening, and they knew that if once he got hold of one of them with those big cruel claws of his, that would be the end.|$|E

50|$|Most staffed camps have a swap box — a box {{in which}} crews may place {{unwanted}} food and take anything they might desire. Predictably, swap boxes tend to fill up with foods that people tend <b>not</b> <b>to</b> like, <b>get</b> <b>too</b> much of, or food few want to carry. Typical finds in swap boxes include sunflower seeds and apple cider mix, however on occasion much more valuable goods can be found, such as peanut butter, ritz crackers, et cetera. Some crews will have an unofficial organization system where one person will eat food the others don't like, cutting down on food waste.|$|R

He has a strange Indonesian neighbor who claims Adrian's favorite food is stinky bean paste, something that Conri strongly dislikes. Adrian's personality is honest, kind, generous, and understanding, though sometimes these traits are masked in hostility.|$|R
