40|$|ABSTRACT: The present {{investigation}} was aimed to evaluate efficacy of ethanolic extract seeds of Nigella sativa against glucose induced cataract in goat eye lens. In the in vitro study, goat lenses {{were subjected to}} photographic evaluation and biochemical parameters such as protein, GSH, MDA, NA + /K + ATPase and sodium and potassium were also analyzed. Photographic examination of the eyes showed that treatment with ethanolic extracts of seeds <b>of</b> <b>N.</b> sativa retarded <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> lens opacification. Cataract lens treated with <b>N.</b> sativa elevated <b>the</b> activity of Na + K + ATPase, total and water soluble proteins and K + ions {{to the level of}} normal level whereas reduced concentrations of Na + ions. The MDA levels were significantly less in <b>the</b> <b>N.</b> sativa treated groups whereas, the level of GSH, in high glucose (55 mM), compared to the normal control group was significantly low but N. sativa treated groups showed higher level of GSH. These results support the view that ethanolic extract of seeds of N. sativa as seen in this in vitro model may, counteracts the effects of glucose in inducing cataract to some extent.

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> refractive {{errors of}} pupils in Hetian Road primary school of Shanghai Zhabei community {{and analyze the}} relationship between refractive errors progression and relative factors. METHODS:All the 6 - 12 years old in-school pupils in Hetian Road primary school of Shanghai Zhabei community were invited in the study. The participates were examined first-visit in May 2011 and second-visit in May 2012. All the 303 pupils(606 eyes) were investigated the age, height(H), weight(W), uncorrected visual acuity(UCVA), diopter of spherical(DS), diopter of cylinder(DC), spherical equivalent(SE), axial length(AL), and corneal curvature(K). <b>The</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> refractive condition was described and the relevant factors were analyzed. RESULTS:Among 606 eyes, <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> average SE was - 0. 45 ± 0. 60 D and <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> average AL was 0. 32 ± 0. 25 mm. <b>The</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> SE diopter {{was positively correlated with}} <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> AL(r = 0. 409, P P = 0. 004).

40|$|METCAM, an {{integral}} membrane {{cell adhesion molecule}} (CAM) in the Ig-like gene superfamily, is capable of performing typical functions of CAMs, such as mediating cell-cell and cell-extracellular interactions, crosstalk with intracellular signaling pathways, and modulating social behaviors of cells. METCAM is expressed in about nine normal cells/tissues. Aberrant expression of METCAM {{has been associated with}} <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> several epithelial tumors. Further in vitro and in vivo studies show that METCAM plays a dual role in <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> different tumors. It can promote <b>the</b> malignant <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> several tumors. On the other hand, it can suppress <b>the</b> malignant <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> other tumors. We suggest that the role <b>of</b> METCAM in <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> <b>of</b> different cancer types may be modulated by different intrinsic factors present in different cancer cells and also in different stromal microenvironment.
