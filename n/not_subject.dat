5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic pH range 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils <b>not</b> <b>subject</b> to waterlogging.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Lim {{noted that}} the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all {{children}} {{have the opportunity to}} receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for children with special needs were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for children with special needs was <b>not</b> <b>subject</b> to the same subsidies that students in mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E
