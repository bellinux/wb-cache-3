5|$|On February 15, 2013, La Sombra {{defeated}} Volador Jr. {{to win the}} 2013 Reyes del Aire tournament. Following their clash {{over the}} Reyes del Aire trophy Volador Jr. and La Sombra were teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament, the same tournament that in 2010 was the impetus for Volador Jr.'s rudo turn. The rivals put their issues aside for the tournament, defeating the teams of Guerrero Maya Jr. and Negro Casas, La Máscara and Averno, and Shocker and Mr. Niebla {{to qualify for the}} finals of the tournament. On March 15, at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, Volador Jr. and La Sombra defeated Altantis and Último Guerrero to win the Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles. The truce between La Sombra and Volador Jr. that allowed them to win the tag team tournament only lasted until the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> two rivals were in the same ring. On February 17, 2013 La Sombra teamed up with Marco Corleone and Místico II against Volador Jr., Euforia and Último Guerrero. During the match Volador Jr. attacked both La Sombra and the referee, causing a disqualification before leaving the ring and his confused partners behind. On September 13 at CMLL's 80th Anniversary Show, La Sombra and Volador Jr. defeated Atlantis and Último Guerrero in a Relevos Suicidas match and thus advanced to a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuestas against each other.

5|$|The game, which largely {{follows the}} action RPG and hack and slash {{gameplay}} of previous {{games in the}} series, sees players alternate between the roles of Sora and Riku. Alternating between characters is done via the 'Drop' system. During gameplay, a Drop Gauge gradually depletes over time, though it can be replenished with items. When the gauge completely empties, control will switch to the other character, though players may also opt to drop manually at any time. Drop Points, which are earned by defeating enemies and completing optional objectives, can be spent on bonuses {{that can be used}} until the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> character drops, such as a slower Drop Gauge or increased attack or defense. The game reuses the Command Deck system from Birth by Sleep, in which players can customize a deck filled with various actions, spells, and items that can be quickly selected. There are also several new elements added to the gameplay. Flowmotion allows players to move quickly about by performing actions such as bouncing off walls, grinding on rails and spinning around poles. Reality Shift is a system the player can use on certain objects or weakened opponents involving a touch-screen activated minigame unique to each world. These include dragging the screen to fling a target like a catapult, touching hidden words to take control of enemies, and playing a small rhythm-based game to cause fireworks to appear.|$|E

Two days later, Los Depredadores del Aire defeated Los Reyes de la Atlantida (Atlantis, Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr.) {{to win the}} Mexican National Trios Championship. For July 29, Volador Jr. traveled to Tokyo, Japan, {{in an attempt to}} regain the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship from Prince Devitt, but would eventually fail in his title challenge. The following month, Volador Jr. started a rivalry with Mr. Niebla, for which he was positioned as a tecnico even though still being a part of rudo stable Los Invasores. On October 30, Los Depredadores del Aire lost the Mexican National Trios Championship back to Los Reyes de la Atlantida. On January 22, 2013, Volador Jr. survived a torneo cibernetico to advance to a final match for the vacant CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship against the other survivor, Rey Escorpión. On January 29, Volador Jr. was defeated in the finals of the tournament by Escorpión. Following their clash over the Reyes del Aire trophy, Volador Jr. and La Sombra were teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament, the same tournament that in 2010 was the impetus for Volador Jr.'s rudo turn.

The <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Lions had the ball, Jeris White intercepted a pass intended for Sims and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown, the second longest interception return in NFL playoff history. Then on their third possession, quarterback Eric Hipple was sacked by blitzing cornerback Vernon Dean causing a fumble that defensive tackle Darryl Grant recovered on the Redskins 19-yard line. This set up Mark Moseley's 26-yard field goal to make the score 10–0 with just over two minutes left in the first quarter.|$|E

Around 100,000 people came to support India during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record. The crowd's reaction to Tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The match resumed after Tendulkar {{and the president of}} the ICC appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200people.

Unitas was knocked {{out of the game}} permanently on the play with a rib injury and was replaced by Earl Morrall, who was widely blamed for the Colts loss in Super Bowl III. The Cowboys, starting from their own 15, were unable to score any points off the turnover. After sustaining a 15-yard pass interference penalty, they punted. After regaining possession, the Colts offense, led by Morrall, stormed {{all the way to the}} Cowboys 2-yard line with less than two minutes remaining in the half. However, the Cowboys defense stiffened. Colts running back Norm Bulaich was stuffed on three consecutive rushing attempts from inside the 2-yard line. On fourth down, Morrall threw an incomplete pass, turning the ball over on downs and ending the half with Dallas leading 13–6.|$|E
