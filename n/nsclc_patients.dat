50|$|Mutations in the kinase {{domain of}} the EGFR are {{observed}} with approximately 2 to 25% of non-small cell lung carcinoma (<b>NSCLC)</b> <b>patients.</b> Some studies have shown a negative correlation between the effectiveness of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and such mutations.

50|$|In May 2013, erlotinib, a drug {{manufactured}} by Astellas, {{was approved by}} the U.S. FDA to treat <b>NSCLC</b> <b>patients</b> with tumors caused by mutations of EGFR.

The significant relationship between GPS and OS was assessed in all the subgroup analyses stratified by the study type (retrospective vs. prospective) and different stages (early stage vs. stage IV or inoperable).

40|$|Abstract. Gefitinib {{has come}} to be the most widely used {{epidermal}} growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (<b>NSCLC)</b> in Asian <b>patients.</b> Common side effects include mild to moderate skin rash and diarrhea, however, drug-induced liver injury of varying severity is overlooked in long‑term gefitinib administration and rarely reported. The current case report presents a female Chinese <b>NSCLC</b> <b>patient</b> who developed severe gefitinib‑induced hepatotoxicity and was rechallenged with gefitinib following a 3 ‑month break. The patient achieved partial clinical remission but developed drug-induced grade 4 hepatotoxicity following gefitinib administration for 14 months. As an alternative, 4 cycles of chemotherapy were administered to control tumor progression. Following restora-tion of the patient's liver function, gefitinib was rechallenged together with active hepatoprotective therapy. The patient presented good disease control and maintained normal liver function for> 6 months. Thus, sequential chemotherapy and gefitinib rechallenge with hepatoprotective therapy may be a potential new treatment strategy for gefitinib‑induced hepa-totoxicity...|$|R

However, whether erlotinib actually enters into brain metastases has not been adequately elucidated. In this study, we investigated the accumulation of [11 C]-erlotinib by positron emission tomography (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MethodsA 32 -year-old <b>patient</b> with <b>NSCLC</b> and multiple brain metastases was treated with first-line erlotinib.

A PET/CT of the brain with [11 C]-erlotinib was performed during treatment, and a MRI of the head and a CT of the chest were performed pre- and posttreatment. ResultsThe primary lung tumor displayed an erlotinib-sensitizing exon 19 deletion in the EGFR gene, and [11 C]-erlotinib PET/CT showed accumulation in the brain metastases.
