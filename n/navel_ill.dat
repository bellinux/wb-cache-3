40|$|The {{prevalence}} of surgical diseases of 2081 cattle was studied from different free-ranging (Bathan) and stall-feeding systems. The overall {{prevalence of}} surgical disease of cattle was higher (53. 2 %) in Bathan {{than in the}} stall-feeding (37. 5 %) system. In Bathan, the most prevalent surgical diseases were myiasis (13. 4 %) followed by <b>navel</b> <b>ill</b> (12. 5 %), trauma (10. 8 %), claw diseases (7. 6 %), arthritis (6. 1 %), horn diseases (3. 4 %) and teat obstruction (2. 6 %). In stall-feeding system, the highest prevalence (10. 6 %) was claw diseases and <b>navel</b> <b>ill</b> (6. 6 %). <b>Navel</b> <b>ill,</b> hernia, arthritis, horn diseases, urolithiasis and tail gangrene were more prevalent in male; and claw diseases, trauma, myiasis, upward patellar fixation and dislocation of hip joint were more prevalent in female cattle. Most diseases were more prevalent in summer but claw diseases, urolithiasis and teat crack were more prevalent in winter. Clean environment is needed to reduce the prevalence of such problems.

40|$|Some calves with {{neonatal}} {{diarrhea and}} distinctly disturbed general condition have elevated {{blood levels of}} D-lactate and respond poorly to the usual correction of acidosis. This observation led to this prospective study with the objective to elucidate whether calves with elevated D-lactate levels require higher doses of sodium bicarbonate and more frequent treatments than calves with normal D-lactate levels. Among the calves admitted to the clinic between September, 2002, and March, 2003, 73 calves with an age of up to 3 weeks were included in this study. Further selection criteria were diarrhea (according to the history or upon admission), and metabolic acidosis with a base excess below - 10 mmol/l. Exclusion criteria were hypoglycemia, hyperkalemia, evidence of myodystrophy, severe bronchopneumonia, and <b>navel</b> <b>ill</b> requiring surgical intervention. Within the period of investigation (24 hours) the calves received a standardized therapy but no anti-inflammatory drugs and no oral rehydration solutions. Dosage of sodium bicarbonate was calculated using the formula body weight x base deficit x 0. 6 and administered in a volume of 2. 5 liters within 3. 5 hours. During the subsequent 20 hours the calves received infusions of 0. 9 % sodium chloride in volumes corresponding to the estimated fluid loss. Blood samples were taken before the infusion and after four and 24 hours and assayed for D-lactate concentration and base excess; additionally, behavior and posture of the calves were recorded. Voluntary milk intake at the first regular feeding {{after the end of}} the investigation was also recorded. Approximately 85 % of the calves had elevated D-lactate levels. Significant correlations between D-lactate levels and both behavior and posture were found, allowing for a relatively reliable diagnosis of hyper-D-lactatemia on the basis of clinical signs. Posture and behavior seemed to be more strongly influenced by D-lactate than by degree of acidosis. No correlations were found between either D-lactate level or base excess, and milk intake. Mean D-lactate concentration decreased very little after the first four hours, whereas a distinct drop was observed after the subsequent 20 hours. A possible explanation for this finding is that metabolism of D-lactate increases after the normalization of blood pH. Significant correlations between D-lactate levels and base excess after the sodium bicarbonate infusion indicate that calves with elevated D-lactate levels have received to little buffer. Furthermore significant correlations between D-lactate levels and base excess after 24 hours indicate that those calves, which still had elevated D-lactate levels after this period of time, in most cases required a repeated treatment with buffer. Conclusion: Calves with clinical evidence of D-lactate acidosis require higher doses of buffer and possibly repeated treatments...|$|E
40|$|Herd level {{cross-sectional}} and calf level longitudinal {{observational study}} was conducted between November 2014 to April 2015 in peri-urban and urban dairy farms of Bahir Dar milk-shed, Ethiopia. The aims {{of this study were}} therefore, to determine the incidence rate of calf morbidity and mortality, investigating potential determinant factors of calf morbidity and mortality and to determine the passive transfer of immunity in some selected dairy calves. Both concurrent and prospective cohorts were employed to recruit calves aged below 6 month in the study herds. A total of 440 calves, a random sample of 322 calves from small-holder and 118 from five large dairy farms located in Bahir Dar milkshed were included in the study. Each study calf was individually ear -tagged and regularly monitored in monthly basis for clinical health problems up to an age of six months. Information on different potential risk factors was collected by using herd and calf level recording sheets and personal observations. Serum samples were taken from some study calves to determine their level of passive transfer and it was conducted in Bahir Dar Animal Health Diagnostic and Investigation Laboratory. The overall incidences of crude morbidity and crude mortality rates found in this study were 47. 3 % and 17. 9 %, respectively. Calf diarrhea, pneumonia, <b>navel</b> <b>ill,</b> septicemic conditions, Lumpy Skin Disease, rabies, congenital problems and other miscellaneous cases were encountered during this study. The most frequent disease condition was calf diarrhea with the incidence rate of 25. 2 % followed by pneumonia (8. 6 %). The incidence of crude mortality was apparently higher in large sized dairy farms than smallholder farms. However, calf diarrhea and crude morbidity rates were higher in the latter. About six, 6, 4 and 2 explanatory variables were found significantly associated with crude mortality, crude morbidity, diarrhea and pneumonia respectively by multivariate Cox - regression at P< 0. 05. Older calves above three months age were at lower risk (HR= 0. 03, P= 0. 000) of mortality than younger calves of below three month. The relative hazard (HR= 0. 15, P= 0. 000) of mortality in good vigored calves was lower than that of calves with poor vigor at birth. Those calves fed complete colostrum were found at lower risk (HR= 4. 64, P= 0. 000) of mortality than those fed partial colostrum. Birth type (twin vs. single), method of colostrum feeding and farming system were also the other risk factors determining calf mortality. Likewise, older calves were found at lower risk of crude morbidity (H= 0. 45, P= 0. 000) than younger calves. The hazard of morbidity in those good vigored calves at birth was lower (HR= 0. 26, P= 0. 000) than calves with history of poor vigor. Furthermore, dam age, dam birth related disorders and study location were also found additional risk factors of crude calf morbidity. The relative hazard of diarrhea in crossbred calves (HR= 2. 63, P= 0. 016) was higher than that of local counter parts. Those good vigored calves at birth were also found at lower risk (HR= 0. 24, P= 0. 000) of diarrhea than that of poor vigored counter parts. Furthermore, calf age and study location were found to be additional risk factors of calf diarrhea. Those calves with previous treatment history were at greater risk (HR= 0. 076, P= 0. 000) for pneumonia than calves which did not receive any previous medical treatment. Moreover, vigor status at birth (HR= 0. 24, P= 0. 000) was found significantly associated with calf pneumonia. Out of 46 calves examined by Zinc sulfate (ZnSo 4. 7 H 20) turbidity test, about 8. 7 % of them were found with no detectable colostral Ig (FPT), the remaining 34. 8 % and 56. 5 % were found with adequate and partial protection levels, respectively. Generally, 65. 2 % of calves were found immunologically unprotected in the study herds. In conclusion, the incidence of calf morbidity and mortality found in this study were high and above economically tolerable level. This record therefore, could affect the productivity of the dairy farms through mainly decreasing the availability of replacement stock. Among the significant risk factors investigated, calf vigor, age, breed, dam age and amount of colostrum ingestion were found very important determinant factors of calf mortality and morbidity under the context of small-holder farming system in Bahir Dar milk-shed. A sound dairy calf management practice, is therefore needs understanding and manipulating of the above mentioned calf health determinant factors with subsequent application of tailor-made interventions.
