40|$|The use of {{open source}} {{software}} {{is becoming more and}} more predominant and it is important that the reliability of this software are evaluated. Even though a lot of researchers have tried to establish the failure pattern <b>of</b> different <b>packages</b> a deterministic model for evaluating reliability is not yet developed. The present work details a simplified model for evaluating the reliability of the {{open source software}} based on the available failure data. The methodology involves identifying a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> at the start of the time and defining the failure rate based on the failure data for these preset <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages.</b> The defined function of the failure rate is used to arrive at the reliability model.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{introduce}} a new multi-objective optimization problem derived from a real-world application: the package server location problem. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> servers are to be located at nodes of a network. Demand for these package servers is located at each node, and a subset of nodes are to be chosen to locate one or more package servers. Each client is statically associated to a package server. The objective is to minimize the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> servers while maximizing the efficiency and {{the reliability of the}} broadcast <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> to clients. These objectives are contradictory: the broadcast becomes more efficient as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> servers increases. This problem is analyzed as a multi-objective optimization problem and a mathematical formulation is proposed. In addition, the criteria combination can be specified via a small dedicated language. Results for exact multi-objective solution approaches based on mixed integer linear programming are reported...|$|R

Having selected any product, limitations must be faced and some of these will only be found after selection.

40|$|Software {{reliability}} engineering has gained considerable {{momentum in the}} recent past. A variety of models are available {{for the evaluation of}} software reliability. However the models, as such, cannot be applied for software based systems as any given system is comprised of both hardware and software. The present paper brings up an algorithm for determining reliability of software based systems by integrating both hardware reliability and software reliability. The open source software data is made use of and the methodology for evaluating the software reliability involves identifying a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> {{at the start of the}} time and defining the failure rate based on the failure data for these preset <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages.</b> The defined function of the failure rate is used to arrive at the software reliability model.

Some <b>of</b> these <b>packages</b> use standard formats and are inter-operable, whereas others are much less so.|$|R

40|$|Packaging the {{integrated}} circuit (IC) chip {{is a necessary}} step in the manufacturing process of IC products. In general, wafers with {{the same size and}} process should have a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaged</b> dies. However, many factors decrease the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the actually <b>packaged</b> dies, such as die scratching, die contamination, and die breakage, which are not considered in the existing die-counting methods. Here we propose a robust method that can automatically determine the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> actual <b>packaged</b> dies by using machine vision techniques. During the inspection, the image is taken {{from the top of the}} wafer, in which most dies have been removed and packaged. There are five steps in the proposed method: wafer region detection, wafer position calibration, dies region detection, detection of die sawing lines, and die number counting. The abnormal cases of fractional dies in the wafer boundary and dropped dies during the packaging are considered in the proposed method as well. The experimental results show that the precision and recall rates reach 99. 83 % and 99. 84 %, respectively, when determining the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> actual <b>packaged</b> dies in the 41 test cases...|$|R

Generally, the import process is faster for apt/dpgk based virtual machines than for yum/rpm based virtual machines. The source of this problem seems to be the use of the rpm binary to extract the information from the database.|$|R
40|$|This study explores whether {{patients}} with Type 2 diabetes mellitus have higher drug use {{as compared to}} {{patients with}}out diabetes over a time period prior to and after diagnosis of diabetes. A case-control study compared drug use of patients with a future diagnosis of diabetes (cases) with patients without a diagnosis (controls) based on community pharmacy records. Cases had used oral hypoglycaemic drugs during 2006. A repeated measures analysis calculated the mean <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> and costs <b>of</b> drugs in cases during the two years prior to diagnosis and the first year following diagnosis and in control patients during three years. Volume of drug use was expressed as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> consumed by a patient. Drug costs {{were based on the}} public price. Our dataset covered 2, 697 patients (899 cases and 1, 798 control patients). The mean annual <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>packages</b> and costs <b>of</b> drugs increased over time for cases and control patients (p< 0. 001). In patients with a future diagnosis of diabetes, the growth in drug use and costs over time was more pronounced than in control patients (p< 0. 001). Higher drug use and costs were mainly observed for cardiovascular drugs, antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs, and drugs related to gastric acid disorders. Patients with a future diagnosis of diabetes have higher drug use and costs prior to diagnosis than control patients. Drug use could be an indicator to trigger active monitoring for Type 2 diabetes mellitus...|$|R
