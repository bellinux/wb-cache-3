40|$|In {{response}} to their traumatic experience of dispossession, <b>stateless</b> <b>Palestinians</b> adopted several modes of resistance. Their efforts have included tactics deemed illegitimate by outside observers, and many Palestinians themselves. The involvement of women in violence has also provoked unease. It seems to throw into question women’s traditional role. This chapter explores Palestinian women’s justifications for what some describe as ‘atrocities’. However, random acts of violence by Palestinians, aimed at ending the Israeli occupation, can also be seen, {{in the context of}} this book as expressions of deep insecurity. Far from espousing a ‘moral’ cause, the use of indiscriminate violence suggests the disintegration of Palestinian claims to justice; this is further reinforced by the involvement of women as defenders and perpetrators of terror as a weapon of resistance...|$|R
50|$|Rabei {{flew into}} Frankfurt, Germany on June 1999. He {{was arrested for}} not having any {{identification}} while travelling on a train from Germany to France on 20 June 1999. He doesn’t know why he was traveling to France remains unknown. When he was arrested, he introduced himself as Muhammad Abdul Hadi Fayed, and {{claimed to be a}} <b>stateless</b> <b>Palestinian</b> person who came from Libya to stay in Frankfurt, Germany. However, the authorities could not verify any of this information. Rabei applied for political asylum as a Palestinian refugee. His request was denied in July 1999 and he was sent promptly to prison. While in prison, he worked as a prison janitor. He was released on 12 September 2000 and sent to a hostel for asylum seekers in Lebach, Saarland, Germany. At the refugee center, people noticed he was very religious and spoke English well. Rabei started a prayer group and began to act as a kind of an imam.|$|R
5000|$|His {{wife and}} three eldest {{children}} were granted refugee status in Canada. Since he was a <b>stateless</b> <b>Palestinian,</b> there was no country to which he could be safely deported, and his wife ended up acquiring an entry visa for him to Algeria, and he was put on a plane towards Algeria through Switzerland on July 5, but returned to Canada a week later after Algerian authorities refused to let him enter. It was later revealed that his Canadian escorts had taken him to Casablanca hoping to leave him in Morocco; but while they were themselves [...] "mistakenly left behind" [...] in the North African country, Baroud had simply booked himself a plane back to Canada.

This move came following the Comorian legislature's decision to sell Comorian <b>nationalities</b> to <b>stateless</b> Bedoons in the Gulf countries, including UAE, in return for these Gulf countries' economic investment in Comoros.

50|$|Large {{numbers of}} {{political}} dissidents, including Abwehr personnel, sought refuge in Portugal after {{the plot of}} 20 July 1944 to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Until late 1942, immigration was very restricted. In cases in which refugees were suspected to desire not simply to pass through Portugal in transit to their destination, but rather intended {{to remain in the}} country, the consulates needed to get a previous authorization from Lisbon. This was frequently the case with foreigners of indefinite or contested <b>nationality,</b> <b>stateless</b> individuals, Russians, and Jews expelled from their countries of origin. Other refugees {{on their way to the}} Americas were allowed to use the country as an escape route. The list of famous people that used Portugal as an escape route in this way is quite extensive and includes names such as Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Peggy Guggenheim, Max Ernst, Marc Chagall, Arthur Koestler, Calouste Gulbenkian, Otto von Habsburg, etc. The novel The Night In Libson by Erich Maria Remarque is a fictionalized description of the experience of European political refugees seeking escape from Nazism via Portugal in this era and the plot focuses heavily on the difficulty many had of obtaining the documents and money they needed to leave.|$|R
2500|$|While in America, Kook led a {{group of}} Irgun activists under the {{pseudonym}} [...] "Peter Bergson", supposedly to avoid embarrassing his family (particularly his famous uncle Abraham Isaac) with his political activities. The name [...] "Bergson Group" [...] or [...] "Bergsonites" [...] eventually became {{used to refer to}} all the members of Kook's immediate circle. The Bergson Group was composed of a hard-core cadre of ten Irgun activists from Europe, America and Palestine, including Aryeh Ben-Eliezer, Yitzhak Ben-Ami, Alexander Rafaeli, Shmuel Merlin, and Eri Jabotinsky. The Bergson Group was closely involved with various Jewish and Zionist advocacy groups, such as the American Friends for a Jewish Palestine and the Organizing Committee of Illegal Immigration. The group also founded some separate initiatives of its own, specifically the Committee for a Jewish Army of <b>Stateless</b> and <b>Palestinian</b> Jews, whose goal was the formation of an Allied fighting force of <b>stateless</b> and <b>Palestinian</b> Jews. Some credit the later formation of the Jewish Brigade, a British unit of Palestinian Jews, with Kook's activism. Two American members of the Bergson Group were author and screenwriter Ben Hecht and cartoonist Arthur Szyk.|$|R
40|$|This thesis interrogates the {{continued}} statelessness {{of more than}} 12 million stateless people around the world, {{in the face of}} Article 15 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which provides that everyone has a right to a nationality. Its principal argument is that {{the continued}} unresolved presence of stateless groups around the world exposes international law’s inadequate protection of the ‘right to a nationality’. It advocates the adoption of a robust approach to protect and enforce this right to <b>nationality</b> of <b>stateless</b> people. Article 15 of the UDHR has been complemented by a host of international and regional instruments relating to the right to nationality. In developing its argument, the thesis reviews the relevant instruments, as well as local and international judicial decisions relating to the right. The review is juxtaposed with local legislation and state practices on the issue of citizenship, for the purpose of determining the status of the right, and whether the right forms part of customary international law. This thesis also examines the emergence of nationality as a human right under international law and the interplay between states sovereignty and the right to nationality, for the purpose of showing the lacuna in international law that allows continued statelessness. It examines the relationship between the possession of nationality and the enjoyment of other human rights vis-à-vis the sufferings that arise from statelessness, as well as the extent to which denationalization is a step toward genocide, for the purpose of showing that protection of the right qualifies as erga omnes obligation. It also argues that suffering of stateless people must be taken seriously, as a step toward taking the right to <b>nationality</b> of <b>stateless</b> people seriously. While the thesis does not necessarily provide the final solution to all the problems arising out of statelessness, it is anticipated that it will make a worthy contribution to addressing the legal questions on statelessness and, more importantly, provide a sound basis for further discussions on the status, importance and the need to protect and enforce the right to <b>nationality</b> of <b>stateless</b> people...|$|R
2500|$|On November 11 of 1939, the Portuguese {{government}} sent Circular 14 to all Portuguese consuls throughout Europe {{stating the}} categories of war refugees whom the PVDE considered to be [...] "inconvenient or dangerous." [...] The Dispatch allowed consuls to keep on granting Portuguese transit visas, but established {{that in the case}} of [...] "Foreigners of indefinite or contested <b>nationality,</b> the <b>Stateless,</b> Russian Citizens, Holders of a Nansen passport, or Jews expelled from their countries and those alleging to embark from a Portuguese port without a consular visa for their country of destination, or air or sea tickets, or an Embarkation Guarantee from the respective companies, the consuls needed to ask permission in advance to the Foreign Ministry head office in Lisbon." [...] With Europe at war this meant that refugees fleeing from Nazism would have serious difficulties.|$|R
50|$|According to the 1952 Israeli Citizenship Law, any Palestinian who {{discontinued}} {{residency in}} Israel after {{the establishment of}} the state, also known as the ‘1948 refugees’, lost his entitlement to automatic Israeli citizenship by right of residence.Section 3 of the 1952 Citizenship law states that 3 conditions must be met in order to acquire citizenship by way of residence. First, one must currently be residing in Israel. Second, one must have been present in Israel after {{the establishment of the}} state in 1948. And lastly, one must be registered in the 1951 population registry. These conditions are meant to grant citizenship to those who stayed in Israel during the 1948 war and to deny status to those who had fled. Those who did not meet the necessary conditions were left <b>stateless</b> since <b>Palestinian</b> citizenship was abolished {{with the end of the}} British Mandate.|$|R
50|$|Weill {{had all the}} {{necessary}} credentials to collaborate on We Will Never Die. As a German emigrant, son of a cantor, student of Ferruccio Busoni, and a born theater composer, he had mastered techniques for the effective use of music in both pageants and radio. He had used theater to highlight social concerns throughout his career. Although often characterized as a political composer because of his association in Germany with Bertolt Brecht, close analysis of his music and writings reveal him to be {{more concerned with the}} human condition than with political causes. His willingness to work on We Will Never Die was probably motivated more by the plight of the Jews in Europe than by a conviction to join Hecht in supporting Peter Bergson and the Committee for a Jewish Army of <b>Stateless</b> and <b>Palestinian</b> Jews.|$|R

40|$|This is an ethnographic {{study of}} the fraught and complex {{cultural}} politics of music making in Palestine-Israel {{in the context of}} the post-Oslo era. I examine the politics of sound and the ways in which music making and attached discourses reflect and constitute identities, and also, contextualize political action. Ethical and aesthetic positions that shape contemporary artistic production in Israel-Palestine are informed by profound imbalances of power between the State (Israel), the <b>stateless</b> (<b>Palestinians</b> of the occupied Palestinian territories), the complex positioning of Israel's Palestinian minority, and contingent exposure to ongoing political violence. Cultural production in this period is also profoundly informed by highly polarized sentiments and retreat from the expressive modes of relationality that accompanied the 1990 s peace process, strategic shifts in the Palestinian struggle for liberation, which is increasingly taking place on the world stage through diplomatic and cultural work, and the conceptual life and currency Palestine has gained as an entity deserving of statehood around the world. The ethnography attends to how the conflict is lived and expressed, musically and discursively, in both Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories (oPt) of the West Bank, encompassing different sites, institutions and individuals. I examine the ways in which music making and attached discourses reflect and constitute identities, with the understanding that musical culture is a sphere in which power and hegemony are asserted, negotiated and resisted through shifting relations between and within different groups. In all the different contexts presented, the dissertation is thematically and theoretically underpinned by the ways in which music is used to culturally assert or reterritorialize social and spatial boundaries in a situation of conflict. Beginning with cultural policy promoted by music institutions located in Israel and in the West Bank, the ethnography focuses on two opposing approaches to cultural interventions in the conflict: music as a site of resistance and nation building amongst Palestinian music conservatories located in the oPt, and music is a site of fostering coexistence and shared models of citizenship amongst Jewish and Arab citizens in mixed Palestinian-Jewish environments in Israel. This follows with the ways in which music making is used to re-write the spatial and temporal boundaries imposed on individuals and communities by the repressive regime of the occupation. The ethnography also attends to the ways in which the cultural construction of place and nation is lived and sounded outside of institutional frameworks, in the blurry boundaries and `boderzones' where fixed ethno-national divisions do not align with physical spaces and individual identities. This opens up spaces for alternative imaginings of national and post-national identities, of resistance and coexistence, of the universal and the particular, that musically highlight the daily struggles of individuals and communities negotiating multiplex modalities of difference...|$|R
40|$|This article {{questions}} {{the validity of}} conventional notions of borders as fixed territorial areas. Through oral history as a method and critique, I examine the narratives of eight persons who are <b>Palestinian</b> <b>stateless</b> refugees from Syrian who have escaped to neighboring Lebanon since 2011. Oral history has a methodological strength that allows access to narratives {{of past and present}} events, some of which link the mass eviction of people from Palestine in 1948 – known as Al-Nakba (the Catastrophe), to the currentday Syrian crisis, which is perceived by Palestinians from Syria as a new and ongoing Nakba (al Nakba al mustamirrah in Arabic). The narrators of this often experience border crossing as a pervasive part of their reality one that can be described as “social death,” a result of the limitations imposed by borders on the lives of stateless people. I argue that the accounts presented speak back to a world of borders whilst challenging the nation-state driven order of borders as fixed spaces. Through strategies of self-reflexivity, shared authority and maintaining relations, I open a discussion of how to use privilege, for example the privilege of possessing a European passport, and having the recourses to document experiences across geographical areas, as a way of speaking back to a world of checkpoints whilst advocating a process of research decolonization.

40|$|Since the 1954 and 1961 UN Conventions {{pertaining}} to statelessness, which were both signed and ratified by The Netherlands, {{there has been}} a lack of improvement in the situation of stateless persons. Although statelessness is quite widespread in Europe, there are only a handful of countries that actually have a statelessness determination procedure in place. The Netherlands is not one of these countries, although they {{are in the process of}} developing such a procedure at the moment of writing. Since statelessness is a serious problem, and The Netherlands is usually a country that values human rights and its position as a leading country in Europe, it is interesting to find out why there is no such procedure in place yet. This might be because in the years right after the drafting of both aforementioned conventions, statelessness and nationality were considered to be a national matter, and not an international one. This meant that there was little pressure from the international community in developing a procedure. However, since then much has changed, and it is now generally acknowledged to be an international matter, which needs to be dealt with accordingly. Not having a <b>nationality,</b> being <b>stateless,</b> is hard enough as it is, but at least if one has the official status of being stateless, there are procedures in place which allow for obtaining of the Dutch nationality after a period of time. However, if a person does not even have the official status of being stateless, they are stuck in a legal limbo which is extremely difficult to get out of. In this period of time, since they have no official status, they have hardly, if any, legal rights anymore. Even the universal human rights that many speak of are not attainable for this group of people. 6 Therefore this paper will deal with several aspects of the issue. Firstly, an overview of what statelessness means will be provided, including the definitions of de jure and de facto statelessness. Secondly, the question of why there is no statelessness determination procedure in place in the Netherlands will be addressed. This is followed by looking into the option of developing a European Union-wide set of standards for statelessness determination procedures and the framework in which this should be done. Finally, an overview will be given in the conclusion, followed by a set of recommendations for the development of the Dutch statelessness determination procedure...|$|R
