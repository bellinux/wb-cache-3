5|$|The series began {{development}} in January 2007. HBO acquired the TV {{rights to the}} novels, with Benioff and Weiss as its executive producers, and Martin as a co-executive producer.

Initially, Martin would write one episode per season while Benioff and Weiss would write {{the rest of the}} episodes. Jane Espenson and Bryan Cogman were later added to write one episode apiece the first season.|$|E
5|$|A Song of Ice and Fire {{takes place}} on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The {{point of view of}} each chapter in the story is a limited {{perspective}} of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first <b>novel,</b> <b>to</b> thirty-one by the fifth. Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.|$|E
5|$|After {{his first}} novel, The Wooden Horse, in 1909, Walpole wrote prolifically, {{producing}} {{at least one}} book every year. He was a spontaneous story-teller, writing quickly to get all his ideas on paper, seldom revising. His first <b>novel</b> <b>to</b> achieve major success was his third, Mr Perrin and Mr Traill, a tragicomic story of a fatal clash between two schoolmasters. During the First World War {{he served in the}} Red Cross on the Russian-Austrian front, and worked in British propaganda in Petrograd and London. In the 1920s and 1930s Walpole was much in demand not only as a novelist but also as a lecturer on literature, making four exceptionally well-paid tours of North America.|$|E

5|$|Another crucial {{literary}} {{source for}} film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first <b>novel</b> <b>to</b> be published was Little Caesar, in 1929. It {{was turned into}} a hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for Scarface, while The Beast of the City (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date. Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriotsâ€”his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as films noir, including three of the most famous: High Sierra (1941), This Gun for Hire (1942), and The Asphalt Jungle (1950).|$|E
5|$|Aram Avakian was {{initially}} selected {{to be the}} film's director, but when he continually refused to do a sentimental-type dog story, he was replaced by Leslie H. Martinson. Lillie Hayward and Roberta Hodes wrote the screenplay for the film, adapting several of the short stories from the <b>novel</b> <b>to</b> create a single narrative, and adding in an all-purpose villain. The film was released on June 6, 1962. The studio {{hoped it would be}} successful enough to be followed by a second film and a television series. Though praised by fans and modern reviewers, contemporary critiques felt Terhune's work did not translate well to film and it was considered a low budget, B-movie. It was released to home video in 1995.|$|E
5|$|As {{a first-time}} novelist, Niffenegger had trouble finding a {{literary}} agent. She eventually sent the <b>novel</b> <b>to</b> MacAdam/Cage unsolicited and, after an auction took {{place for the}} rights, Niffenegger selected them as her publishers. The book became a bestseller after an endorsement from author and family friend Scott Turow on The Today Show, and as of March 2009 had sold nearly 2.5 million copies in the United States and the United Kingdom. Many reviewers were impressed with Niffenegger's unique perspectives on time travel. Some praised her characterization of the couple, applauding their emotional depth; others criticized her writing style as melodramatic and the plot as emotionally trite. The novel won the Exclusive Books Boeke Prize and a British Book Award. A film version was released in August 2009.|$|E
