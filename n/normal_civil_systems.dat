In two petitions to the crown challenging this conviction Bruce accounted that he had asked Lieutenant Cooper to include him on any raids but he had found nothing and taken nothing. Bruce also challenged the credibility of key witnesses, and referred to his previous good character and military record: handling {{large sums of money}} in Russia and Japan with no losses. Bruce made several unsuccessful appeals against his conviction, these attempts eventually led to a bankruptcy hearing at Cheltenham in 1924. He was convicted by Court Martial on 22 December 1920 due to the <b>normal</b> <b>civil</b> court <b>system</b> having broken down in Ireland at that time and his MC and DSO were forfeited in July 1921.|$|R

Every agency had a shadow “political hiring czar” whose operation trumped <b>normal</b> <b>civil</b> service authority of personnel offices. Then-White House Personnel Office chief Fred Malek teamed up with Alan May to prepare the “Malek Manual,” a guide to exploiting loopholes in civil service laws to drive politically undesirable career employees out of government {{and replace them with}} applicants selected through a political rating system of 1-4, based on factors such as campaign contributions and future campaign value. The Watergate Committee’s finding of the abuses led to creation of the Ink Commission, whose exhaustive study and recommendations were the foundation for the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, including creation of the Office of Special Counsel to see that this type of merit system abuse never happened again.|$|R

40|$|The {{negative}} impact of variability on <b>civil</b> <b>systems</b> projects is investigated in research in Lean Construction. However, geometric variability has received little focus. Geometric variations due to tolerances can have costly direct and indirect impacts in <b>civil</b> <b>systems,</b> which include architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) projects. Nevertheless, AEC practitioners and researchers, overall, lack {{an understanding of how}} tolerances and tolerance problems propagate throughout a project. In contrast, investigation into manufacturing reveals more advanced techniques and strategies for tolerance management that have resulted in significant improvement in manufacturing efficiency and product quality. This research investigates the application of manufacturing tolerance management techniques and strategies to <b>civil</b> <b>systems.</b> The author looked at many industry practices and reports in-depth on three case studies. The first case investigates structural steel bolt connections on the seismic retrofit of a steel suspension bridge. The second looks at the interface between windows and cast-in-place concrete in a multi-story building.

An analytical complication, however, is that the effects are often combined with other treatments such as class size reductions (Muralidharan and Sundararaman 2010; Duflo et al. 2011; Bold et al. 2013), which makes it difficult to isolate the effect of contract teachers.|$|R
