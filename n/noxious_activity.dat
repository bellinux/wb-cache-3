40|$|New {{paradigms}} {{have been}} recently {{proposed in the}} pathogenesis of both {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), evidencing surprising similarities between these deadly diseases, despite their obvious clinical, radiological and pathologic differences. There is growing evidence supporting a "double hit" pathogenic model where in both COPD and IPF the cumulative action of an accelerated senescence of pulmonary parenchyma (determined by either telomere dysfunction and/or a variety of genetic predisposing factors), and the <b>noxious</b> <b>activity</b> of cigarette smoke-induced oxidative damage are able to severely compromise the regenerative potential of two pulmonary precursor cell compartments (alveolar epithelial precursors in IPF, mesenchymal precursor cells in COPD/emphysema). The consequent divergent derangement of signalling pathways involved in lung tissue renewal (mainly Wnt and Notch), can eventually lead to the distinct abnormal tissue remodelling and functional impairment that characterise the alveolar parenchyma in these diseases (irreversible fibrosis and bronchiolar honeycombing in IPF, emphysema and airway chronic inflammation in COPD) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{northern}} Cameroon, {{the rice}} weevil, Sitophilus oryzae L. (Coleptera: Curculionidae) {{is a major}} pest of Sorghum bicolor (Poaceae) during storage. This staple crop is currently damaged by many insects and others pests during storage. To reduce the post-harvest losses due to S. oryzae, many control strategies are performed. An important step to achieve successful control is to isolate and characterize the <b>noxious</b> <b>activity</b> of rice weevil present on the sorghum variety currently stored. The present study shows that the two main ecotypes of S. bicolor, the "djiigari" ecotype is very susceptible to the 7 weevils strains isolated in the region. In a period of 100 days a single female {{of one of the}} most prolific strains produces 24 adults and more than 57 % of grains are attacked.

For this purpose, histopathological analysis, genotoxicity and oxidative status were investigated in this setting. A total of twenty Wistar rats weighing 250 g on the average, and 8 weeks age were distributed into four groups (n= 5), as follows: Control group (non-treated group, CTRL); Cadmium group (Cd) and Purple carrot extract groups at 400 mg/L or 800 mg/L. Histopathological analysis revealed that liver from animals treated with purple carrot extract improved tissue degeneration induced by cadmium intoxication. Genetic damage was reduced in blood and hepatocytes as depicted by comet and micronucleus assays in animals treated with purple carrot extract. SOD-CuZn and cytocrome C gene expression increased in groups treated with purple carrot extract. Purple carrot extract also reduced the 8 OHdG levels in liver cells when compared to cadmium group.

40|$|Introduction]: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{characterized by}} the deposition of -amyloid (A) in the brain, which produces progressive neuronal loss and dementia. We recently demonstrated that the noxious effects of A on cultured hippocampal neurons are in part provoked by the antagonism of nerve growth factor (NGF) signalling, which impairs the activation of nuclear factor B (NF-B) by impeding the tyrosine phosphorylation of I-B. As a result, {{the expression of the}} homologue of Enhancer-of split 1 (Hes 1) gene is downregulated and ultimately, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -ergic connectivity is lost. [Methods]: Hes 1 activity was promoted in cultured hippocampal neurons by overexpressing a Hes 1 -encoding plasmid or by upregulating this gene by activating NF-B through different approaches (overexpressing either the I-B kinase, or p 65 /RelA/NF-B). Alternatively neurons were exposed to TGF 1. Dendrite patterning, GABAergic connectivity and cell survival were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Hes 1 expression was determined by real-time PCR. NF-B activation was measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay. [Results]: The expression of Hes 1 abolished the effects of A on dendritic patterning and GABAergic input, and it prevented the death of the cultured neurons. TGF 1, a known neuroprotector, could counteract the deleterious effects of A by inducing NF-B activation following the serine phosphorylation of I-B. Indeed, the number of GABAergic terminals generated by inducing Hes 1 expression was doubled. [Conclusion]: Our data define some of the mechanisms involved in A-mediated cell death and they point to potential means to counteract this <b>noxious</b> <b>activity.</b> P Chacon was supported by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (Contratos PostDoctorales Sara Borrell).

40|$|Dental {{bleaching}} is {{a simple}} and conservative procedure for aesthetic restoration of vital and non-vital discolored teeth. Nevertheless, {{a number of studies}} have demonstrated the risk of tissue damage from the contact of these agents with the oral mucosa. In the current study, the genotoxic potential associated with exposure to dental bleaching agents was assessed by the single cell gel (comet) assay in vitro. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in vitro were exposed to six commercial dental bleaching agents (Clarigel Gold - Dentsply; Whitespeed - Discus Dental; Nite White - Discus Dental; Magic Bleaching - Vigodent; Whiteness HP - FGM and Lase Peroxide - DMC). The results pointed out that all dental bleaching agents tested contributed to DNA damage as depicted by the mean tail moment, being the strongest effect observed with the highest dose of hydrogen peroxide (Whiteness HP and Lase peroxide, at a 35 % concentration). On the other hand, Magic Bleaching (Vigodent) induced the lowest level of DNA breakage. Negative and positive controls displayed absence and presence of DNA-damaging, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that dental bleaching agents may be a factor that increases the level of DNA damage.

Methods: A total of 17 adults and 17 children submitted to panoramic dental radiography were included in this study. Results: the results indicated no statistically significant differences (P > 0. 05) in children's micronucleated oral mucosa cells before and after dental X-ray exposure. in the same way, no mutagenic effects were observed in adults following X-ray exposure. On the other hand, X-rays increased other nuclear alterations closely related to cytotoxicity such as karyorrhexis, pyknosis and karyolysis in both groups. the comparative analysis between children and adults demonstrated no statistically significant differences in micronucleus frequency or (P > 0. 05). Conclusions: in summary, these data indicate that dental paroramic radiography may not be a factor that includes chromosomal damage, but it is able to promote cytotoxicity.

40|$|Purpose. Although it {{has been}} clearly {{demonstrated}} that X-rays {{play a key role}} in diagnosing medical and dental problems, this type of ionizing radiation is also able to induce <b>noxious</b> <b>activities,</b> such as genetic damage. the aim of the present study was to evaluate DNA damage (micronucleus) and cellular death in exfoliated buccal mucosa cells from healthy individuals (smokers and nonsmokers) following dental X-ray exposure. Material and methods. A total of 39 healthy people who had submitted to panoramic dental radiography were included in the study: 9 smokers and 30 nonsmokers. Results. the results indicated no significant statistically differences (P > 0. 05) in micronucleated oral mucosa cells before and after dental X-ray exposure. On the other hand, X-ray exposure did increase other nuclear alterations closely related to cytotoxicity, such as karyorrhexis, pyknosis, and karyolysis. It seems that cigarette smoke did not affect X-ray outcomes induced in buccal cells. Conclusion. These data indicate that dental panoramic radiography may not induce chromosomal damage, but it is able to promote cytotoxicity. Because cellular death is considered a prime mechanism in nongenotoxic mechanisms of carcinogenesis, dental X-ray should be used only when necessary.

40|$|The present {{studies were}} {{designed}} to examine the role of superficially located nociceptive neurons in spinal opiate analgesia. In the first study, we examined the influence of spinally administered fentanyl on the spontaneous and <b>noxious</b> heat-evoked <b>activity</b> of nociceptive specific (NS: n= 14) and wide dynamic range (WDR: n= 19) neurons in the superficial dorsal horn of decerebrate spinal cord transected cats. Both spontaneous and evoked activities of both types of neurons in the superficial layer were suppressed by spinally administered fentanyl. However, NS neurons were suppressed {{to a lesser degree}} than WDR neurons. In the second study, we also examined the influence of spinally administered morphine of 0. 25 mg on spontaneous and <b>noxious</b> heat-evoked <b>activity</b> of WDR neurons (n= 8) in the superficial dorsal horn of cats. Morphine reduced both spontaneous and evoked activities of WDR neurons. Comparing the results from both the superficially located WDR neurons (present study) and deeply located WDR neurons (previous study 18)), the rate of onset and the degree of suppression by morphine were similar. In the third study, we investigated the distribution and localization of intrathecally administered radioactive morphine in the cat spinal cord by light microscopic autoradiography, and compared the time course of penetration with the neurophysiologic results obtained in the second study. Silver grain numbers in the superficial dorsal horn were 2 - 3 times as large as that in the deep dorsal horn. These results demonstrate the difference in the sensitivity of NS and WDR neurons in the same superficial layer of the spinal cord to fentanyl suppression. It is suggested that there is a difference in sensitivity to morphine suppression between superficially and deeply located WDR neurons, or that deeply located WDR neurons are suppressed by morphine {{at the site of the}} superficial dorsal horn...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the genetic damage induced by paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) in three different male mice strains in peripheral blood, heart, kidney and liver tissues by the single cell gel (comet) assay. Swiss, C 57 BL/ 6 j and hairless (HRS/j) mice were submitted to PSD by the multiple platform technique for 72 hr, and DNA damage was evaluated. Statistically significant differences in DNA damage were found in blood cells of the Swiss mice strain when compared to negative controls. By contrast, no statistically significant differences were found in the C 57 BL/ 6 j or hairless mice strains. With regard to the liver, extensive genotoxic effects were found in the Swiss strain. the hairless and C 57 BL/ 6 j mice strains did not show any signs of genotoxocity in this organ. the same lack of effect was noted in kidney and heart cells of all strains evaluated. in conclusion, our results reveal that sleep deprivation exerted genetic damage in the form of DNA breakage in blood and liver cells of the Swiss mice strain only.

40|$|Sensorimotor {{dysfunction}} following incomplete {{spinal cord}} injury (iSCI) is often characterized by the debilitating symptoms of paralysis, spasticity and pain, which require treatment with novel pleiotropic pharmacological agents. Previous in vitro studies suggest that Albumin (Alb) and Oleic Acid (OA) {{may play a role}} together as an endogenous neurotrophic factor. Although Alb can promote basic recovery of motor function after iSCI, the therapeutic effect of OA or Alb-OA on a known translational measure of SCI associated with symptoms of spasticity and change in nociception has not been studied. Following T 9 spinal contusion injury in Wistar rats, intrathecal treatment with: i) Saline, ii) Alb (0. 4 nanomoles), iii) OA (80 nanomoles), iv) Alb-Elaidic acid (0. 4 / 80 nanomoles), or v) Alb-OA (0. 4 / 80 nanomoles) were evaluated on basic motor function, temporal summation of <b>noxious</b> reflex <b>activity,</b> and with a new test of descending modulation of spinal activity below the SCI up to one month after injury. Albumin, OA and Alb-OA treatment inhibited nociceptive Tibialis Anterior (TA) reflex activity. Moreover Alb-OA synergistically promoted early recovery of locomotor activity to 50 ± 10 % of control and promoted de novo phasic descending inhibition of TA <b>noxious</b> reflex <b>activity</b> to 47 ± 5 % following non-invasive electrical conditioning stimulation applied above the iSCI. Spinal L 4 -L 5 immunohistochemistry demonstrated a unique increase in serotonin fibre innervation up to 4. 2 ± 1. 1 and 2. 3 ± 0. 3 fold within the dorsal and ventral horn respectively with Alb-OA treatment when compared to uninjured tissue, in addition to a reduction in NR 1 NMDA receptor phosphorylation and microglia reactivity.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a disabling inflammatory {{demyelinating disease}} of the central nervous system, considered to result from self-reactivity to myelin antigens. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the p 55 TNF receptor (TNFR) have been strongly implicated in MS pathogenesis. We reveal in this study a dual role for TNF in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for MS. In addition to its well-established proinflammatory effects, TNF exhibits potent immunosuppressive properties, providing {{one possible explanation for}} the immune and disease activating effect of anti-TNF treatment of MS. We show that in TNF-deficient mice, myelin-specific T cell reactivity fails to regress and expansion of activated/memory T cells is abnormally prolonged, leading to exacerbated EAE. Strikingly, immnosuppression by TNF and protection against EAE does not require the p 55 TNFR, whereas the same receptor is necessary for the detrimental effects of TNF during the acute phase of the disease. Thus, blocking the function of the p 55 TNFR in autoimmune demyelination may inhibit the <b>noxious</b> proinflammatory <b>activities</b> of TNF without compromising its immunosuppressive properties.

40|$|SummaryWe {{compared}} brain activations {{in response}} to acute noxious thermal stimuli in controls and chronic back pain (CBP) patients. Pain perception and related cortical activation patterns were similar in the two groups. However, nucleus accumbens (NAc) activity differentiated the groups {{at a very high}} accuracy, exhibiting phasic and tonic responses with distinct properties. Positive phasic NAc activations at stimulus onset and offset tracked stimulus salience and, in normal subjects, predicted reward (pain relief) magnitude at stimulus offset. In CBP, NAc activity correlated with different cortical circuitry from that of normals and phasic activity at stimulus offset was negative in polarity, suggesting that the acute pain relieves the ongoing back pain. The relieving effect was confirmed in a separate psychophysical study in CBP. Therefore, in contrast to somatosensory pathways, which reflect sensory properties of acute <b>noxious</b> stimuli, NAc <b>activity</b> in humans encodes its predicted value and anticipates its analgesic potential on chronic pain.

40|$|Sensorimotor {{dysfunction}} following incomplete {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) is often characterized by paralysis, spasticity and pain. Previously, we showed that intrathecal (i. t.) administration of the albumin-oleic acid (A-OA) complex in rats with SCI produced partial improvement of these symptoms and that oral 2 -hydroxyoleic acid (HOA, a non-hydrolyzable OA analogue), was efficacious in the modulation and treatment of nociception and pain-related anxiety, respectively. Here we observed that intrathecal treatment with the complex albumin-HOA (A-HOA) every 3 days following T 9 spinal contusion injury improved locomotor function assessed with the Rotarod and inhibited TA <b>noxious</b> reflex <b>activity</b> in Wistar rats. To investigate the mechanism of action of A-HOA, microarray analysis {{was carried out in}} the spinal cord lesion area. Representative genes involved in pain and neuroregeneration were selected to validate the changes observed in the microarray analysis by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Comparison of the expression between healthy rats, SCI rats, and SCI treated with A-HOA rats revealed relevant changes in the expression of genes associated with neuronal morphogenesis and growth, neuronal survival, pain and inflammation. Thus, treatment with A-HOA not only induced a significant overexpression of growth and differentiation factor 10 (GDF 10), tenascin C (TNC), aspirin (ASPN) and sushi-repeat-containing X-linked 2 (SRPX 2), but also a significant reduction in the expression of prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) and phospholipases A 1 and A 2 (PLA 1 / 2). Currently, SCI has very important unmet clinical needs.

However, it produces profound analgesia without pain enhancement when co-administration with low dose naloxone. To examine {{the effect of}} nalbuphine or nalbuphine plus naloxone on activity in brain regions that may explain these differences, we employed pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) in a double blind cross-over study with 13 healthy male volunteers. In separate imaging sessions subjects were administered nalbuphine (5 mg/ 70 kg) preceded by either saline (Sal-Nalb) or naloxone 0. 4 mg (Nalox-Nalb).

The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of a novel and potent non-nucleoside adenosine kinase (AK) inhibitor, ABT- 702, on the responses of dorsal horn neurones to selected peripheral stimuli. ABT- 702 is orally effective to reduce behavioural signs of nociception in models of acute, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain. Electrophysiological recordings were made from wide dynamic range (WDR) neurones in halothane-anaesthetized rats. ABT- 702 was given subcutaneously following either carrageenan inflammation or peripheral nerve injury (L 5 /L 6 spinal nerve ligation). Comparisons were made between carrageenan and uninjected control animals, and similarly between spinal nerve ligated (SNL) and sham operated animals. ABT- 702 produced inhibition of the postdischarge, wind-up and C-fibre evoked responses in both carrageenan and nerve-injured animals. Furthermore, the mechanical and thermal evoked responses were similarly reduced in SNL rats. Overall, ABT- 702 produced a significantly greater inhibition of these responses in SNL rats as compared to sham controls. Similarly ABT- 702 tended to produce greater effects after carrageenan inflammation, however this did not reach significance. Protection of endogenous adenosine by ABT- 702 therefore produces a marked inhibition of the <b>noxious</b> evoked neuronal <b>activity</b> in inflamed and neuropathic rats.

40|$|Background and Purpose Functional neuroimaging can {{distinguish}} {{components of the}} pain experience associated with anticipation to pain from those associated {{with the experience of}} pain itself. Anticipation to pain is thought to increase the suffering of chronic pain patients. Inappropriate anxiety, of which anticipation is a component, is also a cause of disability. We present a pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which we investigate the selective modulation by midazolam of brain activity associated with anticipation to pain compared to pain itself. Methods Eight right-handed male volunteers underwent fMRI combined with a thermal pain conditioning paradigm and midazolam (30 μg/kg) or saline administration on different occasions, with order randomized across volunteers. Volunteers learned to associate a colored light with either painful, hot stimulation or nonpainful, warm stimulation {{to the back of the}} left hand. Results Comparison of the period during thermal stimulation (pain−warm) revealed a network of brain activity commonly associated with <b>noxious</b> stimulation, including <b>activities</b> in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the bilateral insular cortices (anterior and posterior), the thalamus, S 1, the motor cortex, the brainstem, the prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum. Comparison of the periods preceding thermal stimulation (anticipation to pain−anticipation to warm) revealed activity principally in the ACC, the contralateral anterior insular cortex and the ipsilateral S 2 /posterior insula. Detected by a region-of-interest analysis, midazolam reduced the activity associated specifically with anticipation to pain while controlling for anticipation to warm. This was most significant in the contralateral anterior insula (P<. 05). There were no significant drug effects on the activity associated with pain itself.

40|$|Neural coding in medial {{prefrontal cortex}} (mPFC) {{is thought to}} {{underlie}} various cognitive behaviors such as rule-guided learning, strategy use, or cognitive flexibility. Specifically, prefrontal neurons display many behaviorally relevant correlates related to sensory perception, motor responses, or reward that are believed to contribute to behavioral outcome. The mPFC is the cortical region that receives exceptionally dense dopaminergic (DA) innervation arising from the mesopontine Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA). Noradrenergic fibers originating from the brain stem nucleus Locus Coeruleus (LC) are also dense in mPFC. Previous investigations indicated that NA and DA systems have common target neurons in mPFC. The ascending NA and DA projections to mPFC have been implicated in {{a broad range of}} cognitive processes in rodents and primates including modulation of perception, attention, motivation, or memory. It is still, however, unknown whether and how NA and DA affect the prefrontal neural codes. To address this question, we performed simultaneous recordings of unit activity and local field potentials in mPFC, VTA and LC in the rat. We first studied temporal relations of firing activity in the three brain regions during spontaneous and evoked activity under anesthesia. Mild electric shocks were applied to the rat hind paw for somatosensory stimulation. The LC neurons responded to a single foot shock (1 ms, 5 mA) with a short latency (~ 20 ms), phasic burst, followed by brief inhibition. Trains of pulses (100 ms, 50 Hz, 5 mA) elicited much stronger responses. The mPFC and VTA neurons did not respond to a single foot shock. Trains elicited sustained (~ 1 s) excitatory responses in a subpopulation of mPFC neurons with latencies of ~ 100 ms, usually followed by inhibition. Trains elicited both excitatory and inhibitory responses in a small number of putative dopaminergic, VTA cells, with latencies always greater than 100 ms. Both spontaneous and evoked activity of VTA neurons was highly synchronized with mPFC activity; cortical activity always led VTA by several milliseconds. In some cases, sensory stimulation resulted in entrainment of mPFC and VTA neurons in several cycles of slow oscillation. Next, we inhibited the LC by systemic or local application of clonidine, an α 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist. This manipulation dramatically abolished the excitatory evoked responses in both VTA and mPFC without having much effect on spontaneous activity. The results indicate that short-latency responses of LC neurons to somatosensory stimulation with corresponding release of NA modulate sensory responses in the target regions including mPFC and VTA. The long-latency responses of the VTA cells suggest that its ascending projections do not {{play an important role in}} modulating mPFC responses to <b>noxious</b> stimuli. VTA <b>activity</b> is rather driven by mPFC and, possibly, modulated by LC. We will further investigate NA modulation of mPFC codes in the rat performing a prefrontaldependent task. To induce release of NA in mPFC, we will apply electrical microstimulation to the LC just before presentation of discrimination stimuli, mimicking the burst activity of LC typically observed in response to salient stimuli. We expect to see more robust coding in the mPFC correlated with better behavioral performance in the presence of LC activation...|$|R
