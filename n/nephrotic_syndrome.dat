40|$|Glomerular visceral {{epithelial}} cells (podocytes) contain interdigitated processes that form specialized intercellular junctions, termed slit diaphragms, which provide a selective filtration barrier in the renal glomerulus. Analyses of disease-causing mutations in familial <b>nephrotic</b> <b>syndromes</b> and targeted mutagenesis in mice have revealed critical roles of several proteins {{in the assembly}} of slit diaphragms. The nephrin–podocin complex is the main constituent of slit diaphragms. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating these proteins to maintain the slit diaphragms are still largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the PAR 3 –atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) –PAR 6 b cell polarity proteins co-localize to the slit diaphragms with nephrin. Furthermore, selective depletion of aPKCl in mouse podocytes results in the disassembly of slit diaphragms, a disturbance in apico-basal cell polarity, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The aPKC–PAR 3 complex associates with the nephrin–podocin complex in podocytes through direct interaction between PAR 3 and nephrin, and the kinase activity of aPKC {{is required for the}} appropriate distribution of nephrin and podocin in podocytes.

40|$|Background. Steroid-resistant <b>nephrotic</b> <b>syndromes</b> (NS) with focal and {{segmental}} glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can be differentiated into sporadic and syndromic forms. In sporadic NS, a circulating FSGS-factor {{is discussed}} in the pathogenesis and is thought to inhibit the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) from l-arginine by blocking the NO synthase (NOS). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor {{of all types of}} NOS. In a previous study we did not find an elevation of ADMA in a syndromic form of FSGS, the Schimke-immuno-osseous dysplasia. Here we report for the first time data on the l-arginine/NO pathway in sporadic FSGS of childhood. Methods. Nine children (5 to 18 years of age) suffering from sporadic FSGS and age-matched healthy controls were investigated. ADMA in plasma and urine as well as l-arginine in plasma were determined by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The NO metabolites nitrate and nitrite were measured in plasma and urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The ADMA metabolite dimethylamine (DMA) was measured in urine by GC-MS. Results. We found elevated plasma levels of ADMA in children suffering from sporadic FSGS compared to healthy controls (851 nmol/L versus 684 nmol/L, P = 0. 008). An inverse correlation between ADMA and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was found in sporadic FSGS (Pearson's correlation coefficient − 0. 784, P = 0. 012). Conclusion. Our study suggests that ADMA synthesis is elevated in sporadic FSGS. This finding argues for the involvement of ADMA in the pathogenesis of this disease in childhoo...|$|R
40|$|Glomerular podocytes {{are highly}} {{specialized}} cells with a complex cytoarchitecture. Their most prominent features are interdigitated foot processes with filtration slits in between. These are bridged by the slit diaphragm, which {{plays a major}} role in establishing the selective permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier. We searched Medline and Pubmed using the combination of keywords "NPHS 2 ", "podocin", "steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome," and "genetics" to identify studies describing an association between NPHS 2 gene and renal disease. The highly dynamic foot processes contain an actin-based contractile apparatus comparable to that of smooth muscle cells. Mutations affecting several podocyte proteins lead to rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, disruption of the filtration barrier, and subsequent renal disease. The fact that the dynamic regulation of the podocyte cytoskeleton is vital to kidney function has led to podocytes emerging as an excellent model system for studying actin cytoskeleton dynamics in a physiological context. Injury to podocytes leads to proteinuria, a hallmark of most glomerular diseases. Recent studies have led to a considerable increase in our understanding of podocyte biology including composition and arrangement of the cytoskeleton involved in the control of ultrafiltration. Moreover, disturbances of podocyte architecture resulting in the retraction of foot processes and proteinuria appear to be a common theme in the progression of an acquired glomerular disease. In hereditary <b>nephrotic</b> <b>syndromes</b> identified over the last few years, all mutated gene products were localized in podocytes.

Further studies suggested that more than one podocyte molecule were together involved in acquired or experimental NS. However, we do not know much on the relationship among these podocyte molecules, and the molecular response induced by the change of each podocyte protein to the remaining ones. We respectively knockdown the nephrin, podocin, CD 2 AP, or α-actinin- 4 mRNA by using reconstructed RNA interference vector – psiRNA-hH 1 GFPzeo in mouse podocyte clone. The molecular behavior or response was revealed by the quantitative expression both at mRNA and protein levels with RT-PCR and Western blot, and by the molecular distribution detected with confocal microscopy. With nephrin knockdown, only CD 2 AP increased, whereas podocin showed no change. Contrarily, with podocin or CD 2 AP knockdown, nephrin decreased, while CD 2 AP or podocin increased. Nephrin, podocin, or CD 2 AP knockdown did not change the expression of α-actinin- 4, whereas α-actinin- 4 knockdown begetted the reduction of nephrin, and the increment of podocin and CD 2 AP. The redistributions of nephrin, podocin, and CD 2 AP were revealed around a predominant nuclear staining compared with the membrane surface staining in the control podocytes. Our data imply that the response between the four podocyte molecules is very complicated and evidently different. There is not always an interaction between podocyte molecules. The normal localization of podocyte molecules would depend on their normal expression quantity and the molecular reactions between them...|$|R

Here we gathered R 3 RPTPs from organisms covering a broad evolutionary distance, annotated their structure and analyzed their phylogenetic relationships. We show that R 3 RPTPs (i) have probably originated in the common ancestor of animals (metazoans), (ii) are variants of a single ancestral gene in protostomes (arthropods, annelids and nematodes); (iii) a likely duplication of this ancestral gene in invertebrate deuterostomes (echinodermes, hemichordates and tunicates) generated the precursors of PTPRQ and PTPRB genes, and (iv) R 3 RPTP groups are monophyletic in vertebrates and have specific conserved structural characteristics. These findings could have implications for the interpretation of past studies and provide a framework for future studies and functional analysis of this important family of proteins...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Membranous Nephropathy (MN) {{represents}} {{a large amount}} of <b>Nephrotic</b> <b>Syndromes</b> in the adult population and its definitive diagnosis is currently carried out through biopsy. An autoimmune condition is suspected in MN in which some glomerular structures are targeted by patient antibodies. We do not know yet the target protein (or proteins) putatively involved and responsible for the disease. The aim of this work is to identify these proteins by screening a lambda-phage library using patient serum pools. METHODS: We set up the following three pools of sera: (i) from 15 MN patients, (ii) from 15 non-MN renal patients (4 with diabetic nephropathy, 4 with focal glomerulosclerosis, 4 with type I membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, 3 with minimal change disease), and (iii) from 15 healthy individuals. A commercial cDNA phagemide library (from healthy kidney whole mRNA) was screened using the above described pooled sera, in order to detect positive signals following antigen-antibody recognition. RESULTS: We detected one phagemide clone expressing a protein which was shown to be targeted by the antibodies of the pooled MN sera only. Control sera were both negative. The cDNA insert carried by the phagemide was subsequently sequenced. In particular, by comparing the sequence we isolated with a human DNA database, a complete matching with the synaptonemal complex protein 65 (SC 65), also known as No 55, was found. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-No 55 autoantibodies appear to be involved in MN physiopathology by being present in patient sera. Considering the invasiveness and the resulting risk coming from renal biopsy, our ongoing aim is to set up a procedure able to diagnose affected patients through a little- or non-invasive method such as blood sampling rather than a biopsy. By dosing patient autoantibodies targeting this self-protein, {{it might be possible to}} carry out a correct diagnosis thus avoiding biopsy-correlated risks...|$|R
