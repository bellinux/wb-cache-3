40|$|This {{study was}} {{prompted}} {{by the prospect of}} transgenic pigs providing donor hearts for transplantation in human recipients. Autonomic innervation is important for the control of cardiac dynamics, especially in the conduction system. Our objective was to assess the relative distribution of autonomic nerves in the pig heart, focusing initially on the conduction system but addressing also the myocardium, endocardium and epicardium (see Crick et al. 1999). Quantitative immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques were adopted. All regions of the conduction system possessed a significantly higher relative density of the total neural population immunoreactive for the general neuronal marker protein gene product 9. 5 (PGP 9. 5) than did the adjacent myocardium. A similar density of PGP 9. 5 -immunoreactive innervation was observed between the sinus node, the transitional region of the atrioventricular node, and the penetrating atrioventricular bundle. A differential pattern of PGP 9. 5 -immunoreactive innervation was present within the atrioventricular node and between the components of the ventricular conduction tissues, the latter being formed by an intricate network of Purkinje fibres. Numerous ganglion cell bodies were present in the peripheral regions of the sinus node, in the tissues of the atrioventricular groove, and even in the interstices of the compact atrioventricular node. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) -containing nerves were the dominant subpopulation observed, representing 60 – 70 % of the total pattern of innervation in the <b>nodal</b> <b>tissues</b> and penetrating atrioventricular bundle. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -immunoreactive nerves were the next most abundant neural subpopulation, representing 37 % of the total pattern of innervation in the compact atrioventricular node compared with 25 % in the transitional nodal region. A minor population of ganglion cell bodies within the atrioventricular nodal region displayed TH immunoreactivity. The dominant peptidergic nerve supply possessed immunoreactivity for neuropeptide Y (NPY), which displayed a similar pattern of distribution to that of TH-immunoreactive nerve fibres. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) -immunoreactive nerves represented 8 – 9 % of the total innervation of the <b>nodal</b> <b>tissues</b> and penetrating atrioventricular bundle, increasing to 14 – 19 % in the bundle branches. Somatostatin-immunoreactive nerve fibres were relatively sparse (4 – 13 % of total innervation) and were most abundant in the nodes, especially the compact atrioventricular node. The total pattern of innervation of the porcine conduction system was relatively homogeneous. A substantial proportion of nerve fibres innervating the <b>nodal</b> <b>tissues</b> could be traced to intracardiac ganglia indicative of an extensive intrinsic supply. The innervation of the atrioventricular node and ventricular conduction tissues was similar to that observed in the bovine heart, but markedly different to that of the human heart.

Here, we applied this approach to investigate sensitivity and specificity of human and automated classification in discriminating images of atrial working myocardium and specialized tissue of the conduction system. Two-dimensional image sequences from atrial working myocardium and <b>nodal</b> <b>tissue</b> of isolated perfused rodent hearts were acquired using a fiber-optics confocal microscope (Leica FCM 1000). We compared two methods for local application of extracellular fluorophores: topical via pipette and with a dye carrier. Eight blinded examiners evaluated 162 randomly selected images of atrial working myocardium (n = 81) and <b>nodal</b> <b>tissue</b> (n = 81). In addition, we evaluated the images using automated classification. Blinded examiners achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 99. 2 ± 0. 3 % and 98. 0 ± 0. 7 %, respectively, with the dye carrier method of dye application. Sensitivity and specificity was similar for dye application via a pipette (99. 2 ± 0. 3 % and 94. 0 ± 2. 4 %, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity for automated methods of tissue discrimination were similarly high.

40|$|Background Standard {{surgical}} {{practice for}} colorectal cancer involves resection {{of the primary}} lesion and all draining lymph nodes. Accurate intraoperative assessment of nodal status could allow stratified resectional extent. One-step nucleic acid (OSNA) can provide a rapid method of interrogating <b>nodal</b> <b>tissue,</b> whilst near-infrared (NIR) laparoscopy together with indocyanine green (ICG) can identify relevant <b>nodal</b> <b>tissue</b> intraoperatively. Methods ICG was administered around the tumour endoscopically prior to the operation. Fluorescent nodes identified by NIR were marked and submitted for whole-node OSNA analysis. Further fresh lymph nodes dissected from the standard resection specimen were examined and analysed by both conventional histology and OSNA. In addition, {{the status of the}} fluorescent nodes was compared to that of non-ICG nodes to assess their predictive value. Results Sixteen patients were recruited with a total final lymph node count of 287. 78 fresh lymph nodes were identified on fresh dissection for both histological and OSNA assessment with an analytical concordance rate of 98. 7 % (77 / 78). OSNA sensitivity was 1 (0. 81 – 1, 95 % CI) and specificity 0. 98 (0. 91 – 1, 95 % CI). Six patients had a total of nine nodes identified intraoperatively by ICG fluorescence. Of these nine nodes, one was positive for metastasis on OSNA. OSNA analysis of the ICG-labelled node matched the final histological nodal stage in 3 / 6 patients (two being N 0 and one N 1). The final pathological nodal stage of the other three was N 1 or N 2, while the ICG nodes were negative. Conclusion OSNA is highly concordant with standard histology, although only a minority of nodes identifiable by full pathological analysis were found for OSNA on fresh dissection.

40|$|The {{generation}} and propagation of the cardiac impulse {{is the central}} function of the cardiac conduction system (CCS). Impulse initiation occurs in <b>nodal</b> <b>tissues</b> that {{have high levels of}} automaticity, but slow conduction properties. Rapid impulse propagation is a feature of the ventricular conduction system, which is essential for synchronized contraction of the ventricular chambers. When functioning properly, the CCS produces ~ 2. 4 billion heartbeats during a human lifetime and orchestrates the flow of cardiac impulses, designed to maximize cardiac output. Abnormal impulse initiation or propagation can result in brady- and tachy-arrhythmias, producing an array of symptoms, including syncope, heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Underlying the functional diversity of the CCS are gene regulatory networks that direct cell fate towards a nodal or a fast conduction gene program. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding of the transcriptional networks that dictate the components of the CCS, the growth factor-dependent signaling pathways that orchestrate some of these transcriptional hierarchies and the effect of aberrant transcription factor expression on mammalian conduction disease...|$|R

This investigation determined the effects of diltiazem on cardiac rate and rhythm, left ventricular (LV) function, central hemodynamics, and peripheral blood flow in normal, standing, nonsedated horses. A dose-finding study was performed. Afterward, 8 healthy horses were treated with diltiazem IV every 30 minutes to achieve cumulative dosages of 0 (saline control), 1, 1. 5, and 2 mg/kg. Plasma diltiazem concentration, heart rate and rhythm (by electrocardiography), LV function and central hemodynamics (by cardiac catheterization), LV dimensions (by echocardiography), and forelimb blood flow (by Doppler sonography) were determined during each treatment period. Diltiazem plasma concentrations between 390 and 910 ng/mL were achieved, with considerable variation among horses. Cardiac effects of diltiazem included intermittent depression of the sinus and atrioventricular (AV) nodes and mild impairment of systolic and diastolic LV function. Vascular effects of diltiazem included arterial vasodilatation, increased limb blood flow, and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Baroreceptor reflex-mediated sympathetic activation increased sinus node rate and presumably blunted the depressive effects of diltiazem on myocardial and <b>nodal</b> <b>tissues.</b> Two horses developed transient high-grade sinus arrest with severe systemic hypotension.

After 5 to 7 hours the polymorphonuclear leucocytes are found densely congregated about the hilar region, and 9 hours after inoculation most of the phagocyted organisms have been digested. At {{the end of the}} 24 hour period the popliteal node presents the picture of a subsiding inflammation with a marked macrophage reaction and regenerating lymph follicles. Phagocytosis of encapsulated pneumococci in the foot-pad and popliteal node occurs in less than 30 minutes after inoculation. It is assumed that this prompt phagocytosis is effected by the non-antibody mechanism of "surface phagocytosis.

40|$|A 53 {{year old}} woman was {{referred}} for percutaneous coronary intervention {{because of a}} recent inferior myocardial infarction. During right coronary artery stent implantation, intermittent occlusion of the coronary side branch for the sinus node occurred, associated with intermittent sinus arrest and junctional escape rhythm. This led to speculation about the potential mechanisms for sinus node dysfunction. Degenerative fibrosis of <b>nodal</b> <b>tissue</b> is actually considered {{the most common cause}} of bradyarrhythmias. Yet, in everyday practice, no particular attention is usually paid to other potential pathogenic mechanisms such as coronary artery disease. This may be particularly true for elderly patients or patients with multiple risk factors. Thus, sinus node dysfunction may be an unrecognised marker of coronary artery disease...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{standstill}} is {{an uncommon}} bradyarrhythmia defined by {{complete absence of}} P waves or other atrial activity on ECG and nodal or ventricular escape rhythms. This electrical disturbance can be temporarily induced by conditions such as severe hyperkalemia and digitalis toxicosis. Alternatively, atrial standstill can be persistent or permanent due to an idiopathic degeneration and fibrosis of atrial and <b>nodal</b> <b>tissue.</b> Pacemaker therapy is the definitive treatment of choice, but due to the often-progressive nature of the cardiomyopathy, ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure often occur within months to years of diagnosis. Even with artificial pacing, survival in dogs with this disease is decreased compared to dogs with other, more common bradyarrhythmias...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the intratumoral T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and the impact of TCR on survival. Experimental Design: We performed high-throughput unbiased TCRβ sequencing on a population-based cohort of 92 patients with DLBCL treated with conventional (i. e., non-checkpoint blockade) frontline "R-CHOP" therapy. Key immune checkpoint genes within the TME were digitally quantified by nano-String. The primary endpoints were 4 -year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: The TCR repertoire within DLBCL nodes was abnormally narrow relative to non-diseased <b>nodal</b> <b>tissues</b> (P < 0. 0001). In DLBCL, a highly dominant single T-cell clone was associated with inferior 4 -year OS rate of 60. 0 % [95 % confidence interval (CI), 31. 7 %- 79. 6 %], compared with 79. 8 % in patients with a low dominant clone (95 % CI, 66. 7 %- 88. 5 %; P = 0. 005). A highly dominant clone also predicted inferior 4 -year PFS rate of 46. 6 % (95 % CI, 22. 5 %- 76. 6 %) versus 72. 6 % (95 % CI, 58. 8 %- 82. 4 %, P = 0. 008) for a low dominant clone. In keeping, clonal expansions were most pronounced in the EBV+ DLBCL subtype that is known to express immunogenic viral antigens and is associated with particularly poor outcome. Increased T-cell diversity was associated with significantly elevated PD- 1, PD-L 1, and PD-L 2 immune checkpoint molecules. Conclusions: Put together, these findings suggest that the TCR repertoire is a key determinant of the TME. Highly dominant T-cell clonal expansions within the TME are associated with poor outcome in DLBCL treated with conventional frontline therapy. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{measurements}} of relative nerve density were achieved using computer-assisted image analysis of immunohistochemically and histochemically defined nerves in the conduction {{system of the}} guinea pig heart. All regions of the conduction system possessed a similar density of nerve fibres and fascicles displaying immunoreactivity for the general neuronal marker protein gene product 9. 5 (PGP 9. 5), and this was 3 to 4 -fold {{higher than in the}} adjacent myocardium. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) positive and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -immunoreactive nerves were the main subtypes identified in the sinus and atrioventricular nodes, representing 40 - 45 % of the stained area occupied by PGP 9. 5 -immunoreactive nerves. AChE-positive nerves were the dominant subtype identified in the left and right bundle branches, but were equal in proportion to TH-immunoreactive nerves in the penetrating bundle. Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive nerves represented the main peptide-containing subpopulation in the <b>nodal</b> <b>tissues,</b> displaying a similar pattern of distribution and relative density to those nerves demonstrating TH immunoreactivity. Substance P and calcitonin gene-related polypeptide immunoreactive nerves were present throughout the conduction system and represented the main peptide-containing subpopulation in the ventricular conduction tissues. Nerve fibres showing immunoreactivity for either somatostatin or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide exhibited distinct patterns of distribution and comprised a relatively minor component of the innervation. The innervation of the guinea pig conduction tissues thus exhibits a uniform distribution and it comprises putative parasympathetic nerves and intrinsic neurons (AChE positive), sympathetic efferent nerves (NPY and TH-immunoreactive nerves) as well as other peptide-containing nerves, some of which (substance P and calcitonin gene-related polypeptide) are considered to represent afferent nerves. The distribution and density of nerve subpopulations in the guinea pig conduction system differ from those observed in the human conduction system, which suggests that the guinea pig may be an inappropriate model for comparative functional studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} significance of papillary or follicular thyroid tissue incidentally discovered in cervical lymph nodes during pathological assessment of neck dissections for non-thyroid cancers {{of the upper}} aero-digestive tract is critically reviewed. Special emphasis is given to controversies over normal-looking, nodal, thyroid follicles. Arguments for and against the benign nature of these follicles are considered together with processes that could be involved in their formation. The admittedly limited evidence suggests that benign, thyroid follicular inclusions rarely occur in cervical lymph nodes. Histological criteria that could be helpful in recognizing the inclusions, which include assessing their extent {{in conjunction with the}} size of the node, are discussed. Finally, an algorithm based on collaboration between specialists, correlating histological findings with imaging and loco-regional control of the upper aero-digestive tract cancer, is suggested for the management of patients with incidentally discovered, <b>nodal</b> thyroid <b>tissue...</b>|$|R
