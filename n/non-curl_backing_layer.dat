The model simulates a linear array consisting of 128 PZT- 5 A crystals, a tungsten-epoxy <b>backing</b> <b>layer,</b> an Araldite matching layer, and a Perspex lens layer. The thickness of the crystal layer is chosen to simulate pulses centered at 4 [*]MHz. The model is used to investigate whether changes in the electromechanical properties of the individual transducer <b>layers</b> (<b>backing</b> <b>layer,</b> crystal layer, matching layer, and lens layer) {{have an effect on}} the simulated in-air reverberation image generated. Changes in the electromechanical properties are designed to simulate typical medical transducer faults such as crystal drop-out, lens delamination, and deterioration in piezoelectric efficiency. The simulations demonstrate that fault-related changes in transducer behaviour can be observed in the simulated in-air reverberation image pattern. This exploratory approach may help to provide insight into deterioration in transducer performance and help with early detection of faults...|$|R

The top layer has the labels printed on its front and conductive stripes printed on the back.

The <b>back</b> <b>layer</b> has conductive stripes printed perpendicularly to those of the front layer. When placed together, the stripes form a grid. When the user pushes down at a particular position, their finger pushes the front layer down through the spacer layer to close a circuit at one of the intersections of the grid.

40|$|Abstract. Laminated {{composites}} with ceramic front {{layers and}} metallic or com-posite <b>backing</b> <b>layers</b> have gained attractiveness as lightweight armours, as they exhibit the same ballistic performance with lower areal densities {{as compared to}} steels. Drop-weight testing (DWT) has potential for evaluating the low velocity impact behaviour of materials. This testing gives significant ideas and information about failure mechanisms and behaviour of materials under low velocity impact. In this study, DWT of alumina/aluminum laminated composites was done in order to investigate the effects of lamination type, density with respect to area and mechan-ical property of backing material on the low velocity ballistic performance of these composites. The experimental {{results showed that the}} laminated composite with ceramic front layer and aged-aluminum alloy as <b>backing</b> <b>layer</b> was the most effec-tive among different investigated specimens against low velocity impact loads...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{analytical}} model of water transport in the polymer electrolyte fuel cell is developed. Nonlinear membrane resistance and voltage loss due to incomplete membrane humidification are calculated. Both values depend on parameter r, {{the ratio of}} mass transport coefficients {{of water in the}} membrane and in the <b>backing</b> <b>layer.</b> Simple equation for cell performance curve, which incorporates the effect of cathodic water is constructed. Depending of the value of r, the cell may operate in one of the two regimes. When r {{greater than or equal to}} 1, incomplete membrane humidification simply reduces cell voltage; the limiting current density is determined by oxygen transport in the <b>backing</b> <b>layer</b> (oxygen-limiting regime). If r < 1, limiting current density is determined by membrane drying (water-limiting regime). In that case there exists optimal current density, which provides minimal membrane resistance. It is shown that membrane drying may lead to parasitic "in-plane" proton current. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} study on fatigue resistance of thin aluminium bearing linings (supported by harder <b>backing</b> steel <b>layers)</b> produced by high velocity oxyfuel (HVOF) spray coating and conventional roll bonding (RB) processes {{has shown that}} the former is superior to the latter with similar lining composition (Al- 20 %Sn- 1 %Cu- 0. 25 %Mn) when compared on the basis of oscillating lining surface strains under a three point bend test condition. In terms of the integrity of the multi-layered bearing systems under oscillating stresses, the HVOF lining appeared to show worse fatigue resistance due to a poor/brittle bond between the lining and the <b>backing</b> steel <b>layer</b> resulting in the detachment of the lining from the <b>backing</b> <b>layer.</b> The newly developed RB alloy with reduced Sn content (Al- 6. 5 %Sn- 2. 5 %Si- 1 %Ni- 1 %Cu- 0. 25 %Mn) and scattered intermetallics showed higher fatigue resistance than the HVOF and previous RB systems.

40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the potential use for bacterial cellulose (BC) as a novel <b>backing</b> <b>layer</b> for fuel cell, BC/Charcoal Activated (BC/CA) composites were prepared by in-situ and casting methods. The BC/CA composites were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis, electrical conductivity measurement, and visual observation. Our {{results showed that the}} penetration of CA into BC network through in-situ method has occurred at concentration below 4 w/v %. It was proved by the changing of the color of culture medium from black (the solution of CA in coconut water) to clear after 2 weeks inoculation. In addition, this carbon still remained in the composites during neutralization. SEM analysis of the composites showed that BC matrix acted as a binder which supports mechanical properties of the composites. Addition of CA enhanced thermal degradation and electrical conductivity of the resultant composites. Electrical conductivity reaches 10 - 2 S/cm for the composites made by casting method containing 10 % CA.

40|$|Conditions for an {{impedance}} {{model to}} be physically admissible are checked for some popular models in the outdoor sound propagation community. They require that {{the definition of the}} impedance model is extended in the whole complex plane and that its inverse Fourier transform is real, causal and passive. For the many impedance models that are written as the square-root of a rational function, such as the Zwikker and Kosten model, the four-parameter Attenborough model and the Hamet and Bérengier model, these conditions are shown to be satisfied for a semi-infinite ground and for a rigidly <b>backed</b> <b>layer.</b> The case of polynomial type models is then investigated. The Delany and Bazley model is not physically admissible as it is real or causal depending on its extension in the complex plane, but it can not simultaneously fulfill both conditions. The Miki model for a rigidly <b>backed</b> <b>layer</b> does not satisfy also the passivity condition as its real part is negative for low frequencies.

The anode employed comprises of the catalyst layer and diffusion layer. The latter comprises of <b>backing</b> <b>layer</b> and catalyst-supporting layer. The supporting layer is present in between the <b>backing</b> <b>layer</b> and the catalyst layer. The composition of the supporting layer is optimized based on the information obtained from polarization and AC impedance measurements. Among the three types of carbons (Black pearl 2000, Vulcan XC- 72, Shawinigan acetylene black), Black pearls 2000 is found to be the ideal type of carbon used in the supporting layer. The optimized loading compositions of carbon, Nafion and PTFE in the supporting layer are reported to be 3 mg cm(- 2), 10 wt%, and 0 wt%, respectively.

Currently, the microchip employs a nonbiodegradable sealant layer, and the new design aims to fabricate it only of biodegradable parts.
