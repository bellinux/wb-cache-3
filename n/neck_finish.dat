40|$|Bottle mould making {{technology}} {{has become one}} of the most important industries nowadays. However, the bottle necks mould making process is given less attention and special tooling is needed in order to shape the mould. Bottle neck tool making process involves features consideration of its complex geometry. This project is aim to design and manufacture the bottle neck tool. This tool will be use to form a shape the workpiece to become bottle neck mould. For that, the tool design was done using Solidworks and Cimatron. The FEA method was used in electrostatic current and voltage analysis on the tool. Finally, the DFM Concurrent Costing was applied to estimate the machining cost before it proceeds into the machining stages. The results show that after FEA analysis, the values of the electrical current magnitude were stated as 1 936. 07 A/m 2 (highest) and 11. 1 649 A/m 2 (lowest) respectively. Meanwhile, the estimated machining cost generated from DFM software was RM 867. 19. A prototype of the <b>neck</b> <b>finish</b> electrode was fabricated at the end of this project. As a conclusion, the electrode design, analysis and fabrication have achieved by using tools such as Solidworks, Cimairon, ALGOR, DFM Concurrent Costing and MasterCAM...|$|E

40|$|The food {{industry}} {{is well aware}} that consumers want innovation and value novelty, and therefore the packaging industry must innovate or stagnate. One of the major trends is material substitution, from glass to polyethylene terepthalate (PET) bottles. Its light weight and convenience are likely to prove popular with consumers. Lightweighting is also a new trend in packaging. Direct printing onto the bottle means that no label is required and a special <b>neck</b> <b>finish</b> enables a tearoff ring-pull closure to be attached. Now a variety of bar code symbologies that can be read by smartphones are appearing on packs. The QR (quick response) is the most common, it can launch exclusive content, update Facebook status, download coupons, promotions and music and invite friends to join. Sustainable packaging has been substituted with a more balanced view of efficient packaging, minimum resources, minimizing product waste, transport and display efficiency and effective after-use disposal and recycling.
