25|$|In general, inventions are {{eligible}} for patent protection if they pass the tests of patentability: patentable subject matter, novelty, inventive step or <b>non-obviousness,</b> and industrial applicability (or utility).|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} for granting patents, requirements {{placed on the}} patentee, {{and the extent of}} the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a granted patent application must include one or more claims that define the invention. A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. These claims must meet relevant patentability requirements, such as novelty, usefulness, and <b>non-obviousness.</b> The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others, or at least to try to prevent others, from commercially making, using, selling, importing, or distributing a patented invention without permission.|$|E

50|$|The {{requirement}} for <b>non-obviousness</b> is codified under s. 28.3 of the Patent Act.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the inventive step, or <b>non-obviousness,</b> {{requirement}} is to avoid granting patents for inventions which only follow from [...] "normal product design and development", in order to eventually achieve a proper balance between the incentives provided by the patent system, namely encouraging innovation, and the social cost of the patent system, namely, conferring temporary monopolies. The <b>non-obviousness</b> bar, hence, {{is a measure of}} what we, as a society, accept as a valuable discovery. Additional reasons for the <b>non-obviousness</b> requirement comprise providing incentives for fundamental research rather than for [...] "incremental improvements", and to minimize the [...] "proliferation of economically insignificant patents that are expensive to search and to license".|$|E
50|$|To be {{considered}} patentable, an invention must pass three criteria: novelty, <b>non-obviousness</b> and utility.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{commonly}} {{assumed that the}} PHOSITA (or its European equivalent) in the <b>non-obviousness</b> provision and in the disclosure provision are the same person. Raising the <b>non-obviousness</b> bar (as has been proposed by people concerned about [...] "trivial patents" [...] being granted) therefore implies that the requirements for disclosure are lowered: if more inventions are considered [...] "trivial", the PHOSITA is apparently considered smarter, so {{they do not need}} an elaborate disclosure. Some writers therefore have proposed to [...] "decouple" [...] the PHOSITA.|$|E

50|$|In general, inventions are {{eligible}} for patent protection if they pass the tests of patentability: patentable subject matter, novelty, inventive step or <b>non-obviousness,</b> and industrial applicability (or utility).|$|E
5000|$|Although all {{countries}} with actively functional patent systems currently have {{a requirement for}} inventive step, {{the need for such}} a doctrine has been questioned. For example, [...] "substantial novelty" [...] has been proposed as an alternative approach. Also, many countries have, in addition to patents, utility models, which have a lower (or none) requirement for <b>non-obviousness</b> in return for a shorter monopoly term duration. The availability of utility model protection minimizes for inventors, developers and manufacturers the risk associated with the uncertainty of <b>non-obviousness</b> analysis (litigation) outcome (see below).|$|E

5000|$|While {{trying to}} weed out the [...] "easy" [...] inventions, the <b>non-obviousness</b> {{requirement}} brings in several downsides to the overall patent system, particularly in the pharmaceutical field, which depends on patent protection most heavily. For example, ...|$|E
50|$|Different {{countries}} have {{different ways of}} dealing with the question of inventive step and <b>non-obviousness</b> in relation to software patents. Europe uses an 'Inventive step test'; see the Inventive step requirement in Europe and, for instance, T 258/03.|$|E
50|$|In patent law, when a {{priority}} is validly claimed, {{the date of}} filing of the first application, called the priority date, {{is considered to be}} the effective date of filing for the examination of novelty and inventive step or <b>non-obviousness</b> for the subsequent application claiming the priority of the first application. In other words, the prior art which is taken into account for examining the novelty and inventive step or <b>non-obviousness</b> of the invention claimed in the subsequent application would not be everything made available to the public before the filing date (of the subsequent application) but everything made available to the public before the priority date, i.e. the date of filing of the first application.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{neither the}} pragmatic {{approach}} nor the [...] "unusual or surprising consequence" [...] criterion {{received further development}} at that time, because the Congress took in 1952 {{a different approach to}} determining <b>non-obviousness</b> going back to a subjective factor similar to the inventor's (called PHOSITA) state-of-mind.|$|E
5000|$|The KSR {{decision}} has been criticized because it apparently replaced the requirement of <b>non-obviousness</b> with the requirement of non-predictability, thus {{making it more difficult}} to get patents in the predictable arts, and creating a contradiction with some Graham's factors such as [...] "failures of others".|$|E
50|$|The {{involvement}} of the public in patent examination is used in some forms to help identifying relevant prior art and, more generally, to help assessing whether patent applications and inventions {{meet the requirements of}} patent law, such as novelty, inventive step or <b>non-obviousness,</b> and sufficiency of disclosure.|$|E
50|$|A {{statistical}} study {{noted that}} there was a multi-fold increase in the percentage of patents found invalid on trials both on the basis of novelty and of <b>non-obviousness</b> before and after the certiorari in KSR. These percentage went down to almost pre-KSR levels in 2 years following KSR.|$|E
5000|$|Constitutionally, the <b>non-obviousness</b> {{requirement}} is established by Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8: [...] "The Congress shall {{have the power}} … to promote the Progress of Science [...]., by securing for limited Times to … Inventors the exclusive Right to their … Discoveries". The phrase to promote the Progress of Science defines {{the purpose of the}} patent system, which is to encourage private investments into fundamental science research rather than to grant monopoly on something that is taken from a public domain (or on something that limits the opportunities for doing research, e.g. research tools are not patentable). The Progress of Science requirement constitutionally validates the pragmatic approach to <b>non-obviousness</b> described below. The word Discoveries establishes the level to which the contribution to the Progress of Science must rise to deserve the temporary monopoly.|$|E
5000|$|Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 248 (1850), was a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{credited with}} introducing into United States patent law {{the concept of}} <b>non-obviousness</b> as a patentability requirement, as well as stating the applicable legal standard for determining its presence or absence in a claimed invention.|$|E
5000|$|WIPO's {{policies}} and laws state that for an invention {{to be eligible}} for patenting, it must fulfill several criteria. Generally, the invention must be within patentable subject matter, must have industrial use or applicability (utility), it must be new (novel) and must exhibit a sufficient [...] "inventive step" [...] (<b>non-obviousness).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{inventive step}} and <b>non-obviousness</b> reflect a general {{patentability}} requirement present in most patent laws, {{according to which}} an invention should be sufficiently inventive—i.e., non-obvious—in order to be patented. In other words, [...] "the nonobviousness principle asks whether the invention is an adequate distance beyond or above {{the state of the}} art".|$|E
50|$|The Patent Act of 1952 added 35 U.S.C. § 103, which {{effectively}} codified <b>non-obviousness</b> as {{a requirement}} {{to show that}} an idea is suitable for patent protection. The section essentially requires {{a comparison of the}} subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art, {{to determine whether or not}} the subject matter of the patent as a whole would have been obvious, at the time of the invention, to a Person having ordinary skill in the art a.k.a. PHOSITA. (Similar criteria were enacted and are currently used in many other countries.) Clark held that the Congress, in passing the Act, intended to codify and clarify the common law surrounding the Patent Act by making explicit the requirement of <b>non-obviousness.</b> However, this test turned out be ambiguous and of little help in practice since PHOSITA does not exist.|$|E
50|$|The TSM test is {{actually}} {{more similar to}} the requirement for novelty than for <b>non-obviousness.</b> Despite an immediate and overwhelming uproar in the technical and legal communities criticizing TSM as being too low, the Congress did not act to overturn the TSM standard. However, its application was refined by the US Supreme Court in KSR v. Teleflex (2006).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of patent law and {{specifically}} in prior art searches, searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to novelty or inventive step (or <b>non-obviousness</b> in United States patent law) of an invention. Under United States patent law, the abstract may be called [...] "Abstract of the Disclosure".|$|E
5000|$|The {{test for}} <b>non-obviousness</b> (also {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "inventive ingenuity" [...] or [...] "inventive step") is whether an [...] "unimaginative skilled technician, in light of his general knowledge and the literature and information on the subject available to him on (the date that the application is filed in Canada), would have been led directly and without difficulty to the invention." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 2) The {{fact that}} an inventor's own {{disclosures}} {{can be used as}} a prior art—not only for novelty but also for <b>non-obviousness</b> analysis—forces both for-profit and not-for-profit (since the Bayh-Dole Act in the USA) business to delay (or to completely stop) dissemination of their research findings, complicates collaborations between different institutions, and gets in the way of the patents' constitutional purpose" [...] to promote Progress of Science".|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} reduce the impact of <b>non-obviousness</b> on patentability, to {{eliminate}} the flash of genius test, and to provide a more fair and practical way to determine whether the invention disclosure deserves a patent monopoly, the Congress took the matter in its own hands and enacted the Patent Act of 1952 35 U.S.C. Section § 103 reads: The last sentence about the manner was added in order to overrule the flash of genius test.|$|E
