25|$|In 1899, the {{university}} opened a <b>national</b> <b>design</b> contest {{for the new}} campus. The renowned Philadelphia firm Cope & Stewardson won unanimously with its plan for a row of Collegiate Gothic quadrangles inspired by Oxford and Cambridge Universities. The cornerstone of the first building, Busch Hall, was laid on October 20, 1900. The construction of Brookings Hall, Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the 1904 World's Fair and Olympics. The delay allowed {{the university}} to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent {{for the development of}} the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson’s original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.|$|E
25|$|Carnegie {{spent his}} last {{years as a}} philanthropist. From 1901 forward, public {{attention}} was turned from the shrewd business acumen which had enabled Carnegie to accumulate such a fortune, to the public-spirited {{way in which he}} devoted himself to utilizing it on philanthropic projects. He had written about his views on social subjects and the responsibilities of great wealth in Triumphant Democracy (1886) and Gospel of Wealth (1889). Carnegie bought Skibo Castle in Scotland, and made his home partly there and partly in his New York mansion located at 2 East 91st Street at Fifth Avenue. The building was built in 1903 and he lived there until his death in 1919. His wife Louise also lived there until her death in 1946. The building is now the Cooper-Hewitt, <b>National</b> <b>Design</b> Museum, part of the Smithsonian Institution. The surrounding neighborhood on Manhattan's Upper East Side has come to be called Carnegie Hill. The mansion was named a National Historic Landmark in 1966. He then devoted his life to providing the capital for purposes of public interest and social and educational advancement.|$|E

500|$|Two {{years after}} the attacks, federal {{officials}} formed the Flight93 National Memorial Advisory Commission responsible for making design recommendations for a permanent memorial. A <b>national</b> <b>design</b> competition was held to create a public memorial in the Pennsylvania field where Flight93 crashed. The winning design, [...] "Crescent of Embrace", was selected out of a pool of 1,011 submissions on September 7, 2005. The site plan features a large crescent pathway with red maples and sugar maples planted along the outer arc. This design ran into opposition over funding, size, and appearance. Republican Congressman Charles H. Taylor blocked $10million in federal funds toward the project {{as he saw it}} as [...] "unrealistic." [...] Republican Congressional leaders later persuaded him to acquiesce to political pressure and began approving some federal funds. The proposed design has also attracted critics who see Islamic symbolism in the crescent design. An important milestone was announced August 31, 2009, marking an agreement between the landowners and the National Park Service to allow the purchase of land for around 9.5million dollars. The memorial area with a white marble Wall of Names was dedicated on September 10, 2011, the day before the 10th anniversary of the crash of Flight 93. A concrete and glass visitor center was opened on September 10, 2015 on a hill overlooking the memorial, with both the visitor center and the Wall of Names being aligned with the flight path.|$|E
500|$|In {{the words}} of his biographer, Pei has won [...] "every award of any {{consequence}} in his art", including the Arnold Brunner Award from the National Institute of Arts and Letters (1963), the Gold Medal for Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1979), the AIA Gold Medal (1979), the first Praemium Imperiale for Architecture from the Japan Art Association (1989), the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cooper-Hewitt, <b>National</b> <b>Design</b> Museum, the 1998 Edward MacDowell Medal in the Arts, and the 2010 Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 1983 {{he was awarded the}} Pritzker Prize, sometimes called the Nobel Prize of architecture. In its citation, the jury said: [...] "Ieoh Ming Pei has given this century some of its most beautiful interior spaces and exterior forms... His versatility and skill in the use of materials approach the level of poetry." [...] The prize was accompanied by a US$100,000award, which Pei used to create a scholarship for Chinese students to study architecture in the US, on the condition that they return to China to work. In being awarded the 2003 Henry C. Turner Prize by the National Building Museum, museum board chair Carolyn Brody praised his impact on construction innovation: [...] "His magnificent designs have challenged engineers to devise innovative structural solutions, and his exacting expectations for construction quality have encouraged contractors to achieve high standards." [...] In December 1992, Pei was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bush.|$|E
