Jule realises that her mobile phone is gone, and she and Jan leave later that night {{to look for it}} in the house. After she finds it, Hardenberg walks in the door and struggles with Jule when he recognises her. Hearing them, Jan comes downstairs and knocks Hardenberg unconscious with a flashlight. <b>Not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> to do, they call Peter and he comes to their aid.|$|E
5|$|An {{earthquake}} {{opens up}} a previously hidden cavern in Altar Cave {{near the village of}} Ur on the floating continent. Four young orphans under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore the earthquake's impact and come across a crystal of light. The crystal grants them a portion of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. <b>Not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> to make of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive family of their mission and set out to explore an overworld outside the area in which they were brought up, in order to bring balance back to the world.|$|E

Luckily, Sekar {{turns out to be}} a school friend of JB, and when he discovers that Balu and Geetha are truly in love, he steps aside, wishing the couple a happy life. When Balu is finally revealed as JB, Geetha, again <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> to believe, thinks the wedding plans are yet another of Balu's practical jokes and tries to run away. He finds her and clears up all of the misunderstandings between them. The two then get married.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca {{seems to me}} to have taken us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> it is doing.|$|E
5|$|Suleiman {{tried to}} {{reinforce}} his offensive, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> {{had happened in}} the valley, but then Stephen, with the full support of his boyars, ordered a major attack. All his troops, together with peasants and heavy cavalry, attacked from all sides. Simultaneously, Moldavian buglers concealed behind Ottoman lines started to sound their bugles, and in great confusion some Ottoman units changed direction to face the sound. When the Moldavian army hit, Suleiman lost control of his army. He desperately tried to regain control, but was later forced to signal a retreat. The battle lasted for four days, with the last three days seeing the fleeing Ottoman army being pursued by the Moldavian light cavalry and the 2,000-strong Polish cavalry until they reached the town of Obluciţa (now Isaccea, Romania), in Dobruja.|$|E

5|$|The plant {{develops}} {{the ability to}} speak and demands that Seymour feed it. Now anemic and <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> to feed the plant, Seymour takes a walk along a railroad track. When he carelessly throws a rock to vent his frustration, he inadvertently knocks out a man who falls on the track and is {{run over by a}} train. Miserably guilt-ridden but resourceful, Seymour collects the body parts and feeds them to Audrey Jr. Meanwhile, at a restaurant, Mushnick discovers he has no money with him, and when he returns to the shop to get some cash, he secretly observes Seymour feeding the plant. Although Mushnick considers telling the police, he procrastinates by the next day when he sees the line of people waiting to spend money at his shop.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix {{was passing}} through customs at Toronto International Airport, {{authorities}} detained him after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $10,000 bail. He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial, which took place in December of that year. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> was in it. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.|$|E

A young man really well deserves constant support and patronage,' looking at the Doctor, 'who makes such sacrifices.' ...|$|R
25|$|It {{was only}} then that the {{majority}} of the people in the café began to realise what was happening and that the shots were not from a reenactment at the historical site.

25|$|In California {{the police}} and Edwards {{interview}} the Trents. Unknown to them, the flying saucer {{has returned to the}} graveyard. Officer Kelton (Paul Marco) encounters the zombie old man, who then chases him into the Trents' yard, where the zombie old man is hit with Eros' ray, causing his body to rapidly decompose. <b>Not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> to make of this, the Trents, Edwards, and the police drive to the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} {{paradox is}} a theory set forth by Marshall W. Meyer and Vipin Gupta in 1994, which posits that organizations are able to maintain control by <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> exactly performance is. This theory is based on several facts of performance, namely that the number and type of performance measurements that exist are increasing at a rapid rate and that these new metrics tend to be weakly correlated with old ones.|$|E

25|$|Without {{much hope}} of dialog, Maldonado began {{his return to}} Mexico City under hostile conditions. When passing by the Ejido, San Miguel, a Zapatista patrol beckoned them to stop. Maldonado, {{surprised}} and <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> was happening, was handed a radio. Using it, Maldonado and Marcos resumed their dialog, and made agreements {{in accordance with the}} law to start the formal peace talks. Marcos convinced the Zapatista movement to put aside their arms and begin the talks to reach a peace agreement.|$|E
25|$|The civil {{authorities}} were often asked to accumulate information, <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> {{it would be}} used for; in August 1940 a list of aliens showed 407 in Guernsey. In October 1940, they produced {{a list of all}} German, Austrian and Italian people. A census was held of all civilians in August 1941. In September 1941, the census was used to make a lists of all British-born people. This list identified people for deportation to camps in Germany in 1942 and 1943.|$|E
25|$|In {{the dark}} night {{the bow of the}} Helena floated for some time with the ship number 50 showing.

But the USS Radford illuminated the unknown object and identified it as a ship's prow. Finally the destroyer put a searchlight on the floating wreckage and it was identified as the remains of the Helena. The bow would sink later the next day.|$|E

25|$|The prince {{next came}} across a railway {{switchman}} who told him how passengers constantly rushed {{from one place to}} another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows. A merchant then talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated thirst, which was very popular, saving people fifty-three minutes a week. The prince replied that he would instead gladly use that extra time to go around finding fresh water, again underscoring the materialism and lack of spirituality of a world that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> to expect, the British schoolteachers are {{at first}} most excited about {{learning}} from {{and working with}} each other, as under no other circumstances would the three schools {{be able to come}} together and exchange ideas. Finding the same hustle bustle at 4 in the morning at the Jinnah International Airport as the plane lands in Karachi that they would at 8 pm in Birmingham kick-starts the series of experiences and discoveries that this documentary explores. The traditions and customs of Sindh serve as the contextual framework to what they learn about education in Pakistan, how they interact with its peoples, and the many ways in which they embrace its culture.|$|E
25|$|Yasuda joined Toei Doga in April 1958, {{immediately}} after her graduation from high school. Yasuda {{has said that}} she applied <b>not</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> the job entailed but that she had submitted her application {{because she did not}} fancy employment in any of the other jobs available for most women at the time, such as bank teller or store clerk. Instead she took the opportunity to work in a creative field. She started out in the Toei finishing department, in the ink and paint section, where she worked on TV series and commercials as a tracer. In traditional animation a tracer is a person whose job involves transferring cleaned up line drawings onto the cels. Through her work and union activities at the company she made the acquaintance of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki whose careers also began at Toei, joining in 1959 and 1963 respectively.|$|E
