[...] Ozone is a greenhouse gas itself. Many ozone-depleting substances are also greenhouse gases, some agents of radiative forcing are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide over the short and medium term. The increases in concentrations of these chemicals have produced 0.34 ± 0.03 W/m2 of radiative forcing, corresponding to about 14% of the total radiative forcing from increases in the concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases.

Validation of precision estimates (viz., the random component of estimated uncertainty) is important for remote sensing measurements, which provide the {{information about}} atmospheric parameters via solving an inverse problem. For the Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS) instrument, it is of a real challenge, due to dependence of signal-to-noise ratio (and thus precision estimates) on stellar properties, small number of self-collocated measurements, and uncertainty estimates growing with time due to instrument ageing. Estimated uncertainties of ozone retrievals are small in the stratosphere for bright stars, which results in additional complexity of detecting them on the background of <b>natural</b> <b>ozone</b> variability. In this paper, we discuss different methods for geophysical validation of precision estimates and their applicability to GOMOS data. We propose a simple method for validation of GOMOS precision estimates for ozone in the stratosphere. This method is based on comparisons of difference in sample variance with the difference in uncertainty estimates for measurements from different stars selected in a region of small natural variability. For GOMOS, the difference in sample variances for different stars at altitudes 25 - 45 km is well explained by the difference in squared precisions, if stars are not dim. Since it is observed for several stars, and since normalized χ 2 is close to 1 in these occultations in the stratosphere, we can conclude that GOMOS precision estimates are realistic in occultations of sufficiently bright stars. For dim stars, errors are overestimated due to improper accounting for the dark charge correction uncertainty in the error budget. The proposed method can also be applied to stratospheric ozone data from other instruments, including multi-instrument analyses...|$|E

The objective of the project was to systematically investigate two essential aspects relevant in ozone research: for one thing, the contribution of (tropical) ozone to the dynamics of QBO; for another, the impact of large-scale dynamic effects of QBO on global ozone distribution.

In this study, an A. thaliana hol mutant and 35 S::HOL lines were used to investigate the function of HOL. No support was found for the hypothesis that HOL contributes to salt stress tolerance via the disposal of excessive amounts of halides. On the contrary, increased HOL activity made 35 S::HOL plants more susceptible towards salt stress. Despite the toxicity of methyl halides, differences in HOL activity in hol mutant and 35 S::HOL plants did not affect the performance of insect herbivores, nor did it alter the microbial diversity of the rhizosphere in these lines. Microarray analysis of WT and hol mutant plants pointed to a function of HOL in starch/carbon metabolism and stress response pathways in A. thaliana. Brassica crops are significant emitters of methyl halides. A HOL-homologous gene (BraA. HOL. a) was identified in Brassica rapa.

We have used the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) to study the long-term (> few months) influences of solar proton events from 1963 through 2004 on stratospheric ozone and temperature. There were extremely large solar proton events in 1972, 1989, 2000, 2001, and 2003. These events caused very distinctive polar changes in layers of the Earth's atmosphere known as the stratosphere (12 - 50 km; - 7 - 30 miles) and mesosphere (50 - 90 km; 30 - 55 miles). The solar protons connected with these events created hydrogen- and nitrogen-containing compounds, which led to the polar ozone destruction. The nitrogen-containing compounds, called odd nitrogen, lasted much longer than the hydrogen-containing compounds and led to long-lived stratospheric impacts. An extremely active period for these events occurred in the five-year period, 2000 - 2004, and caused increases in odd nitrogen which lasted for several months after individual events. Associated stratospheric ozone decreases of >lo% were calculated to last for up to five months past the largest events.

The four largest events in the past 45 years (August 1972; October 1989; July 2000; and October-November 2003) caused very distinctive polar changes in layers of the Earth's atmosphere known as the stratosphere (12 - 50 km; - 7 - 30 miles) and mesosphere (50 - 90 km; 30 - 55 miles). The solar protons connected with these events created hydrogen- and nitrogen- containing compounds, which led to the polar ozone destruction. The hydrogen-containing compounds have very short lifetimes and lasted for only a few days (typically the duration of the solar proton event). On the other hand, the nitrogen-containing compounds lasted much longer, especially in the Winter. The nitrogen oxides were predicted to increase substantially due to these solar events and led to mid- to upper polar stratospheric ozone decreases of over 20 %. These WACCM results generally agreed with satellite measurements.

It presents the first global and seasonal distributions of lightning-produced NOx (LNOx) based on the observed distribution of electrical storms and the physical properties of lightning strokes. We derive a global rate for cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes of 20 – 30 flashes/s with a mean energy per flash of 6. 7 × 109  J. Intracloud (IC) flashes are more frequent, 50 – 70 flashes/s but have 10 % of the energy of CG strokes and, consequently, produce significantly less NOx. It appears to us that the majority of previous studies have mistakenly assumed that all lightning flashes produce the same amount of NOx, thus overestimating the NOx production by a factor of 3. On the other hand, we feel these same studies have underestimated the energy released in CG flashes, resulting in two negating assumptions. For CG energies we adopt a production rate of 10 × 1016  molecules NO/J based on the current literature. Using a method to simulate global lightning frequencies from satellite-observed cloud data, we have calculated the LNOx on various spatial (regional, zonal, meridional, and global) and temporal scales (daily, monthly, seasonal, and interannual). Regionally, the production of LNOx is concentrated over tropical continental regions, predominantly in the summer hemisphere. The annual mean production rate is calculated to be 12. 2 Tg N/yr, and we believe it extremely unlikely that this number is less than 5 or more than 20 Tg N/yr. Although most of LNOx, is produced in the lowest 5 km by CG lightning, convective mixing in the thunderstorms is likely to deposit large amounts of NOx, in the upper troposphere where it is important in ozone production. On an annual basis, 64 % of the LNOx, is produced in the northern hemisphere, implying that the northern hemisphere should have <b>natural</b> <b>ozone</b> levels as much as 2 times greater than the southern hemisphere, even before anthropogenic influences. The amount of O 3  produced from this NOx is expected to exceed the stratospheric source by a factor of 1. 5, and thus the hemispheric asymmetry in LNOx would lead to a significant excess of northern hemisphere O 3  even in the preindustrial troposphere.

40|$|Distributions of mean ozone levels {{from the}} first two years of data from the NASA Global Atmospheric Sampling Program (GASP) show spatial and {{temporal}} variations in agreement with previous measurements. The standard deviations of these distributions reflect the large <b>natural</b> variability of <b>ozone</b> levels in the altitude range of the GASP measurements. Monthly mean levels of ozone below the tropopause show an annual cycle with a spring maximum which is believed to result from transport from the stratosphere. Correlations of ozone with independent meteorological parameters, and meteorological parameters obtained by the GASP systems show that this transport occurs primarily through cyclogenesis at mid-latitudes. The GASP water vapor data, analyzed with respect to the location of the tropopause, correlates well with the simultaneously obtained ozone and cloud data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Three {{scientific}} ozone {{products from}} the In-frared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) aboard MetOp-A, retrieved in three different research teams (LA, LATMOS/ULB, LISA) with different retrieval schemes, are characterized and validated using ozonesondes measure-ments. The characteristics of the products are analyzed in terms of retrieval sensitivity, systematic and random errors, and ability to retrieve the <b>natural</b> variability of <b>ozone</b> and fo-cus on different partial columns from the lower troposphere up to 30 km. The validation covers the midlatitudes and the tropics and the period from January to December 2008. The products present degrees of freedom (DOF) in the tropo-sphere between 1 and 1. 2 on average in the midlatitudes and between 1 and 1. 4 in the tropics. The DOF are distributed differently on the vertical depending on the profiles and th...|$|R
40|$|Balloon {{sounding}} of {{the ozone}} in the Earth atmosphere was performed {{in order to determine}} the <b>natural</b> behavior of <b>ozone</b> and its recognizable deviations. The importance of ozone in the Earth atmosphere and the orographic situation of observatories and ozone sounding statistics since 1966 are explained. The physical processes governing the total amount of ozone, and the behavior of stratospheric ozone are described. Measurements in the upper stratosphere show a decrease {{of the ozone}} partial pressure above 26 km altitude since 1977. The behavior of tropospheric ozone is discussed. Data since 1977 show increasing ozone values in the troposphere, up to 50 % to 70 %. This increase is independent of the solar radiation intensity and the reinforced transport of stratospheric ozone into the troposphere. The increase in the troposphere cannot compensate the stratospheric decrease...|$|R
