5|$|Raynald {{was held}} in prison until 1176. After his release for a large ransom, he {{did not return to}} Antioch, because his wife had {{meanwhile}} died. He married Stephanie of Milly, the wealthy heiress of Oultrejordain. Since Baldwin IV of Jerusalem also granted Hebron to him, Raynald was one of the wealthiest barons of the realm. He controlled the caravan routes between Egypt and Syria. Baldwin, who suffered from leprosy, made him regent in 1177. Raynald led the crusader army that defeated Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard. He was the only Christian leader to pursue an offensive policy against Saladin, making plundering raids against the caravans travelling near his domains. He built a fleet of five ships which plundered the coast of the Red Sea, threatening the route of the Muslim pilgrims towards Mecca in early 1183. Saladin pledged that he would <b>never</b> <b>forgive</b> Raynald.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1994, the duo {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Waitin' on Sundown. It also produced five charting singles, three of which made {{number one on the}} country charts: [...] "She's Not the Cheatin' Kind", [...] "Little Miss Honky Tonk" [...] and [...] "You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone". The other two singles, [...] "I'll <b>Never</b> <b>Forgive</b> My Heart" [...] and [...] "Whiskey Under the Bridge", both made top ten. Allmusic critic Thom Owens thought that the album's singles were [...] "solid" [...] but {{that the rest of the}} songs were [...] "filler". A review of the single [...] "She's Not the Cheatin' Kind" [...] from the same site praised it for its [...] "hard-driving, honky-tonk spirit". Nash praised the honky-tonk sound of [...] "I'll <b>Never</b> <b>Forgive</b> My Heart", but thought that most of the other songs relied on [...] "contrivance". Randy Lewis of the Orlando Sentinel gave a generally positive review, saying that the [...] "minidrama" [...] of [...] "A Few Good Rides Away" [...] (which Brooks co-wrote) was the strongest track on the album.|$|E

John of Lancaster – the third eldest son of Henry of Bolingbroke – resides at Kenilworth Castle {{with his mother}} Countess Mary and three {{brothers}} Harry, Thomas, and Humfrey.

[...] Richards and Pallenberg would remain a couple for twelve years. Despite these complications, the Rolling Stones toured Europe in March and April 1967. The tour included the band's first performances in Poland, Greece, and Italy.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his success}} on the court, Robertson's college career was soured by racism. In those days, {{southern}} university programs {{such as those of}} Kentucky, Duke, and North Carolina did not recruit black athletes, and road trips to segregated cities were especially difficult, with Robertson often sleeping in college dorms instead of hotels. [...] "I'll <b>never</b> <b>forgive</b> them", he told The Indianapolis Star years later. Decades after his college days, Robertson's stellar NCAA career was rewarded by the United States Basketball Writers Association when, in 1998, they renamed the trophy awarded to the NCAA Division I Player of the Year the Oscar Robertson Trophy. This honor brought the award full circle for Robertson since he had won the first two awards ever presented.|$|E

In 1774, he founded the [...] "Society for Inoculating the Poor Gratis", {{in order to help}} the poor people of Philadelphia afford inoculation. In his autobiography, Franklin writes: [...] "In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the smallpox taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention {{for the sake of the}} parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should <b>never</b> <b>forgive</b> themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen." ...|$|E

[...] The author identifies the press as a key figure in the tenor of the 2016 campaign, [...] "The public hates us reporters in the best of times. But the summer of Trump could easily turn into an Alamo moment for the press." [...] Taibbi comes to the view that members of the press should spend more time hearing out the viewpoints of the American populace, writing, [...] "Just like the politicians our job was to listen, and we talked instead.

A grateful Deimos then aids his brother in battling the god with the Arms of Sparta. Thanatos, however, kills Deimos but is destroyed, in turn, by Kratos. Remarking that his brother is finally free, Kratos places Deimos in his grave (leaving the Arms of Sparta as a grave marker), while the gravedigger states that Kratos has become [...] "Death... the Destroyer of Worlds." [...] Athena appears, begs for forgiveness, and offers full godhood for not revealing the truth, but Kratos ignores her and returns to Olympus, promising that [...] "the gods will pay for this." [...] As Kratos is seen leaving, Athena looks apologetically at Kratos and whispers out of his earshot, [...] "Forgive me... brother." ...|$|E

500|$|Saladin {{revived the}} Egyptian naval force {{and tried to}} capture Beirut, but his ships were forced to retreat. Raynald ordered the {{building}} of five ships which were carried to the Gulf of Aqaba at {{the northern end of}} the Red Sea in February 1183. Raynald laid siege to the Egyptian fortress on Ile de Graye. Part of his fleet made a plundering raid along the coasts, threatening the security of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Raynald left Ile de Graye, but his fleet continued the siege. Saladin's brother, Al-Adil, the governor of Egypt, dispatched a fleet to the Red Sea. The Egyptians relieved Ile de Graye and destroyed the Christian fleet. Raynald's soldiers were executed, and Saladin took an oath that he would <b>never</b> <b>forgive</b> him. Though Raynald's naval expedition [...] "showed a remarkable degree of initiative", according to historian Bernard Hamilton, most modern historians agree that it contributed to the unification of Syria and Egypt under Saladin's rule. Saladin captured Aleppo in June 1183, completing the encirclement of the crusader states.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert Mant, a {{journalist}} who covered the tour, investigated the leak in the mid-1990s. He died in 1997, but had arranged for a summary of his findings {{to be sent to}} David Frith with a request not to publish the information before Bradman died. Mant believed the leak was not a serious crime and pointed out that any of the players except Ponsford and Richardson, who were batting at the time Warner entered the dressing room, could have leaked the story. Bradman, in correspondence with Mant in 1992, continued to blame Fingleton and would <b>never</b> <b>forgive</b> the [...] "dastardly lie he concocted about me" [...] and hoped Mant could clear Bradman's name. As part of his investigations, Mant contacted Corbett's family. Corbett died in 1944, and his son Mac said he never mentioned the leak. However, his daughter Helen related that Corbett had spoken to his wife about the affair. She had told Helen that Corbett had received the information from Bradman. Mant believed that while Corbett may have played a joke on Fingleton in naming the culprit, he would not have done so with his wife.|$|E

Wail al-Shehri's father denied reports that Wail had an {{aeronautics}} degree, as some news reports said, [...] "My son Wail was 25 {{years old and had}} a BA in physical education from the Abha Teacher’s College. He was mentally ill and had gone to numerous clerics for assistance in overcoming this instability. He had asked the school, where he taught, for a 6-month leave to go to Madinah."

I'll <b>never</b> <b>forgive</b> them for that." [...] Family members said that Wail and Waleed became very religious in the months before they disappeared, had expressed interest in going to Chechnya, and hoped for martyrdom. In a report entitled [...] "A Saudi Apology" [...] for Dateline NBC aired on August 25, 2002, John Hockenberry traveled to Asir, where he interviewed Shehri's brother, Salah, who agreed that Wail and Waleed were deceased.
