It is structured in three parts. In the first section, data pertaining to the evolution of access to schooling is analysed in connection with notions of teaching quality. In the second part, the dimension of the problem of quality is evidenced by means of an analysis of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results and their repercussions in Brazil.

40|$|Sobre o pano de fundo do desemprego, da violência e da precariedade do ensino público {{fundamental}} e médio brasileiros atuais, vem ganhando força um discurso que atribui à escola a missão social de prevenção da criminalidade juvenil, não pelo ensino de conteúdos e habilidades ou de preparação para o trabalho, mas como espaço de permanência dos alunos que supostamente os protege dos "caminhos da criminalidade". Uma pesquisa documental - com destaque para os pareceres de Rui Barbosa sobre a educação nacional, datados de 1882 - 1883, mas voltados para o projeto republicano que estava em andamento - revela, no entanto, que o lema "escolas cheias, cadeia vazias" é antigo no discurso educacional do país e data da passagem do Império à República e de suas conseqüências sobre a vida nas cidades: a chamada "questão social" da Primeira República, tida por alguns como "caso de polícia", e por outros como "caso de educação". Embora ciente de que a história é também descontinuidade, a análise destaca a continuidade do processo histórico brasileiro, na qual idéias e ações oficiais, aparentemente diversas, repõem-no sob novas vestes. O texto termina apontando algumas medidas que se fazem necessárias e urgentes se não quisermos permanecer reféns do poder do atraso inerente à lentidão da história do Brasil. In {{the current}} background of unemployment, violence and precariousness of Brazilian secondary education system, a new discourse {{has been gaining}} strength. According to this discourse, the school has the social mission of preventing juvenile criminality. This {{is not expected to}} be done by teaching content and skills or by preparing for the job market, but by being a hangout area where students are protected from the "criminal paths". A documentary survey - highlighting Rui Barbosa’s judgments about national education, which date from 1882 - 1883 and are centered on the republican project that was taking place - reveals, however, that the motto "full schools, empty jails" is an old one in the educational discourse of the country. It dates from the transition from Empire to Republic and from its consequences on the lives of the cities: the so-called "social issue" of the First Republic, considered by some a "police matter" and by others an "education matter". In spite of our awareness that history is also discontinuity, the analysis will emphasize the continuity of Brazilian historical process, in which ideas and official action - apparently dissimilar - display the same core in different outerwear. In the end of the article, we indicate <b>necessary</b> and <b>urgent</b> <b>measures</b> to be taken if we are not to be held as hostages of the loitering power that is inherent in Brazilian history...|$|R
