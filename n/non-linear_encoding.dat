40|$|Abstract—Recent {{empirical}} evidence supports {{the hypothesis that}} invariant visual object recognition might result from <b>non-linear</b> <b>encoding</b> of the visual input followed by linear decoding [1]. This hypothesis has received theoretical support {{through the development of}} neural network architectures which are based on a <b>non-linear</b> <b>encoding</b> of the input via recurrent network dynamics followed by a linear decoder [2], [3]. In this paper we consider such an architecture in which the visual input is non-linearly encoded by a biologically realistic spiking model of V 1, and mapped to a perceptual decision via a sparse linear decoder. Novel is that we 1) utilize a large-scale conductance based spiking neuron model of V 1 which has been well-characterized in terms of classical and extra-classical response properties, and 2) use the model to investigate decoding over a large population of neurons. We compare decoding performance of the model system to human performance by comparing neurometric and psychometric curves. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{coherence}} {{function of}} integrate-and-fire neurons shows low-pass {{properties in the}} most diverse firing regimes [1]. While the coherence function provides a good approximation to the full information transfer properties {{in the case of}} a weak input, for a strong input <b>non-linear</b> <b>encoding</b> could play an important role. The complete information transfer is quantified by Shannon’s mutual information rate [2] which has been estimated in certain biological model systems [3]. In general, the exact analytical calculation of the mutual information rate is unfeasible and even the numerical estimation is demanding [4]. Numerical calculation of the mutual information rate is now a commonly adopted practice, but it does not indicate what aspects of the stimulus are best repre-sented by the neuronal response.

40|$|Garcia-Frias, JavierLinear systems {{work very}} well for the {{transmission}} of discrete-time continuous amplitude samples in poor signal-to-noise conditions, but their performance does not improve when {{the quality of the}} channel increases. Specifically, for high signal-to-noise ratios the gap with respect to the theoretical bounds is extremely large and, therefore, a more suitable method must be found. This is why <b>non-linear</b> <b>encoding</b> schemes have been studied, and several solutions have been proposed that outperform the classic linear approach. In this thesis we present analog non-linear mappings with very simple and flexible design methods, low encoding and decoding complexity, and great robustness against noise. All these characteristics make them very versatile codes ready to be applied in many different scenarios. For example, successful results have been achieved in the transmission of images by creating an analog joint source-channel encoding scheme that combines Compressed Sensing measurements with our non-linear analog codes.

40|$|Over {{the brief}} time {{intervals}} available for processing retinal output, roughly 50 to 300 msec, {{the number of}} extra spikes generated by individual ganglion cells can be quite variable. Here, computer-generated spike trains were used to investigate how signal/noise might be improved by utilizing spatiotemporal correlations among retinal neurons responding to large, contiguous stimuli. Realistic correlations were produced by modulating the instantaneous firing probabilities of all stimulated neurons by a common oscillatory input whose amplitude and temporal structure were consistent with experimentally measured field potentials and correlograms. Whereas previous studies have typically measured synergy between pairs of ganglion cells examined one at a time, or alternatively have employed optimized linear filters to decode activity across larger populations, {{the present study investigated}} a distributed, <b>non-linear</b> <b>encoding</b> strategy by using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reconstruct simple visual stimuli from up to one million oscillatory pairwise correlations extracted on single trials from massively-parallel spike trains as short as 25 msec in duration. By integrating signals across retinal neighborhoods commensurate in size to classical antagonistic surrounds, the first principal component of the pairwise correlation matrix yielded dramatic improvements in signal/noise without sacrificing fine spatial detail. These results demonstrate how local intensity information can distributed across hundreds of neurons linked by a common, stimulus-dependent oscillatory modulation, a strategy that might have evolved to minimize the number of spikes required to support rapid image reconstruction...|$|E

40|$|We examine {{transport}} in a holographic {{model in}} which {{the dynamics of the}} charged degrees of freedom is described by the non-perturbative Dirac [...] Born [...] Infeld (DBI) action. Axionic scalar fields are included to break translational invariance and generate momentum dissipation in the system. Scaling exponents are introduced by using geometries which are non-relativistic and hyperscaling-violating in the infrared. When the momentum relaxation is strong, the theory reproduces the anomalous temperature dependence of the resistivity and Hall angle of the cuprate strange metals, ρ∼ T and Θ_H ∼ T^ 2. These scaling laws would not be present without the <b>non-linear</b> dynamics <b>encoded</b> by the DBI interactions. We further show that because of its richness the DBI theory supports a wide spectrum of temperature scalings. This model provides explicit examples in which transport is controlled by different relaxation times. On the other hand, when only one quantity sets the temperature scale of the system, the Hall angle and conductivity typically exhibit the same temperature behavior. We illustrate this point using new fully-backreacted analytical dyonic black brane solutions. Comment: 16 page...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{introduction}} {{in the year}} 2000 by Ahlswede et al., the network coding paradigm has revolutionized the way we understand information flows in networks. Traditionally, information transmitted in a communication network {{was treated as a}} commodity in a transportation network, much like cars on highways or fluids in pipes. This approach, however, fails to capture the very nature of information, which in contrast to material goods, can be coded and decoded. The network coding techniques take full advantage of the inherent properties of information, and allow the nodes in a network, not only to store and forward, but also to "mix", i. e., encode, their received data. This approach was shown to result in a substantial throughput gain over the traditional routing and tree packing techniques. In this dissertation, we study applications of network coding for guarantying reliable and secure information transmission in networks with compromised edges. First, we investigate the construction of robust network codes for achieving network resilience against link failures. We focus on the practical important case of unicast networks with non-uniform edge capacities where a single link can fail at a time. We demonstrate that these networks exhibit unique structural properties when they are minimal, i. e., when they do not contain redundant edges. Based on this structure, we prove that robust linear network codes exist for these networks over GF(2), and devise an efficient algorithm to construct them. Second, we consider the problem of securing a multicast network against an eavesdropper that can intercept the packets on a limited number of network links. We recast this problem as a network generalization of the classical wiretap channel of Type II introduced by Ozarow and Wyner in 1984. In particular, we demonstrate that perfect secrecy can be achieved by using the Ozarow-Wyner scheme of coset coding at the source, on top of the implemented network code. Consequently, we transparently recover important results available in the literature on secure network coding. We also derive new bounds on the required secure code alphabet size and an algorithm for code construction. In the last part of this dissertation, we study the connection between index coding, network coding, and matroid linear representation. We devise a reduction from the index coding problem to the network coding problem, implying that in the linear case these two problems are equivalent. We also present a second reduction from the matroid linear representability problem to index coding, and therefore, to network coding. The latter reduction establishes a strong connection between matroid theory and network coding theory. These two reductions are then used to construct special instances of the index coding problem where vector linear codes outperform scalar linear ones, and where <b>non-linear</b> <b>encoding</b> is needed to achieve the optimal number of transmission. Thereby, we provide a counterexample to a related conjecture in the literature and demonstrate the benefits of vector linear codes...|$|E

Approximations necessary for application of information theory to neural spike trains are presented and different measures are compared. Finally, the consequences of spike patterning caused by relative refractoriness and bursting on information transfer are investigated.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{here the}} results of the first genome-wide survey of candidate exon repetition events in expressed sequences from human, mouse, rat, chicken, zebrafish and fly. Exon repetition is a rare event, reported in < 10 genes, in which one or more exons is tandemly duplicated in mRNA but not in the gene. To identify candidates, we analysed database sequences for mRNA transcripts in which the order of the spliced exons does not follow the linear genomic order of the individual gene [events we term rearrangements or repetition in exon order (RREO) ]. Using a computational approach, we have identified 245 genes in mammals that produce RREO events. RREO in mRNA occurs predominantly in the coding regions of genes. However, exon 1 is never involved. Analysis of the open reading frames suggests that this process may increase protein diversity and regulate protein expression via nonsense-mediated RNA decay. The sizes of the exons and introns involved around these events suggest a gene model structure that may facilitate non-linear splicing. These findings imply that RREO affects a significant subset of genes within a genome and suggests that <b>non-linear</b> information <b>encoded</b> within the genomes of complex organisms could contribute to phenotypic variation. 1411...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{approaches}} to category-level object or scene recognition usually follow the classical supervised classification paradigm where, given some global feature extraction process, the feature vectors {{associated with a}} number of positive and negative training pictures are used to train a classifier such as a support vector machine. Once trained, this classifier can be used to classify test images using the corresponding feature vectors. A key ingredient in these approaches is the design of the feature extraction process. A three-step pipeline combining 1) <b>non-linear</b> local <b>encoding,</b> 2) local spatial pooling, and 3) concatenation of weighted representations of neighboring regions of interest has emerged as a particularly successful feature extraction module. These operations were used in early models of image recognition (and more recent related models), like the neocognitron [3], convolutional networks [4, 6, 7, 8, 12], the HMAX class of models [13], and Pinto et al. ’s object recognition model [11]. Powerful image descriptors like Lowe’s SIFT descriptor [9], the GIST descriptor of Oliva and Torralba [10], the HOG operator of Dalal and Triggs [2] can all be viewed as examples of this same three-step paradigm. The original bag of features model [14], the spatial pyramid of Lazebnik et al.

Methods: A truly portable (< 100 kg) proof-of-concept MRI scanner has been constructed and validated, which replaces conventional gradient encoding with a rotating lightweight, cryogen-free, low-field magnet. When rotated about the object, an inhomogeneous magnetic field pattern {{is used as a}} rotating Spatial Encoding Magnetic field (rSEM) to create generalized projections and encode the iteratively reconstructed 2 D images. Multiple receive channels are used to disambiguate the non-bijective encoding field. Results: The system is validated with experimental images of 2 D test phantoms.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} few years, {{cryptographic}} multilinear maps have proved their tremendous potential as building blocks for new constructions, in particular the first viable approach to general program obfuscation. After the first candidate construction by Garg, Gentry and Halevi (GGH) based on ideal lattices, a second construction over the integers was described by Coron, Lepoint and Tibouchi (CLT). However the CLT scheme was recently broken by Cheon et al.; the attack works by computing the eigenvalues of a diagonalizable matrix over Q derived from the multilinear map. In this paper we describe a new candidate multilinear map over the integers. Our construction is based on CLT but with a new arithmetic technique that makes the zero-testing element <b>non-linear</b> in the <b>encoding,</b> which prevents the Cheon et al. attack. Our new construction is relatively practical as its efficiency {{is comparable to the}} original CLT scheme. Moreover the subgroup membership and decisional linear assumptions appear to hold in the new setting. ...|$|R

The prevalence of these mutations makes these kinase signal transduction pathways an attractive target for cancer therapy. However, tumors have generally shown adaptive resistance to treatment. This adaptation is achieved in melanoma through its ability to undergo neovascularization, migration and rearrangement of signaling pathways. To understand the dynamic, nonlinear behavior of signaling pathways in cancer, several computational modeling approaches have been suggested. Most of those models require that the pathway topology remains constant over the entire observation period. However, changes in topology might underlie adaptive behavior to drug treatment. To study signaling rearrangements, here we present a new approach based on Fuzzy Logic (FL) that predicts changes in network architecture over time.

40|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} human language is compositionality. We can efficiently express {{a wide variety}} of real-world situations, events, and behaviors by compositionally constructing the meaning of a complex expression from a finite number of elements. Previous studies have analyzed how machine-learning models, particularly neural networks, can learn from experience to represent compositional relationships between language and robot actions with the aim of understanding the symbol grounding structure and achieving intelligent communicative agents. Such studies have mainly dealt with the words (nouns, adjectives, and verbs) that directly refer to real-world matters. In addition to these words, the current study deals with logic words, such as “not,” “and,” and “or” simultaneously. These words are not directly referring to the real world, but are logical operators that contribute to the construction of meaning in sentences. In human–robot communication, these words may be used often. The current study builds a recurrent neural network model with long short-term memory units and trains it to learn to translate sentences including logic words into robot actions. We investigate what kind of compositional representations, which mediate sentences and robot actions, emerge as the network's internal states via the learning process. Analysis after learning shows that referential words are merged with visual information and the robot's own current state, and the logical words are represented by the model in accordance with their functions as logical operators.
