The third MEN 2 component is familial MTC (FMTC) in which only MTC is present. These syndromes follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. They are due to activating germline mutations of the RET protooncogene on chromosome 10 q (1). MEN 2 B (MIM 162300) is characterized primarily by earl...|$|R
40|$|Neurinomas, also {{referred}} to as <b>neurilemmomas</b> and schwannomas, are rare benign tumours of the peripheral nerves. A small percentage of these lesions arise from the brachial plexus. The Authors report two cases of schwannoma arising from the brachial plexus. Such lesions, usually asymptomatic, may cause sensitivity alterations or, less frequently, motor deficits in the involved arm.

50|$|Schwannomas {{are mostly}} benign tumors that {{commonly}} occur in individuals with NF2 and schwannomatosis (sometimes called neurofibromatosis type III). Schwann cells are glial cells that myelinate the axons of nerve cells. Myelin is a lipid covering that speeds the conduction of action potentials. When Schwann cells proliferate {{out of control}} in an encapsulation it is called a schwannoma. Although schwannomas are benign they become detrimental when the growing tumor compresses the nerve. Schwannomas on sensory nerve axons cause chronic severe pain. Treatment options for schwannomas are to surgically remove them, have radiation, cyberknife or Intracapsular Enucleation. Previous designations for schwannomas include neurinoma and <b>neurilemmoma.</b>|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Neurilemmoma</b> is {{a benign}} nerve sheath {{neoplasm}} commonly {{located in the}} soft tissue. Intraosseous <b>neurilemmoma</b> is rare, constituting less than 1 % of primary bone tumors. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 21 year-old woman was presented with left elbow pain of 1 -month duration. Plain radiographs showed a well-defined, lytic and expansile lesion of the proximal ulna. Computed tomography revealed cortical destruction and soft tissue extension. Because the tissue of origin for the tumor was uncertain, an open biopsy was performed. The specimens demonstrated a benign spindle cell tumor suggestive of a <b>neurilemmoma,</b> similar to a soft tissue <b>neurilemmoma.</b> The diagnosis of intraosseous <b>neurilemmoma</b> was established. Marginal excision of the soft tissue component and curettage of the lesion in the bone were performed. After 3. 5 years of follow up, there is no clinical or radiographic finding to suggest any recurrence. DISCUSSION: The major site of intraosseous <b>neurilemmoma</b> is the mandible. Occurrence in the long bone is particularly rare. Only two cases of intraosseous <b>neurilemmoma</b> involving the bones around the elbow {{have been reported to}} our knowledge; these cases arose in the distal humerus. We describe the first case of intraosseous <b>neurilemmoma</b> of the proximal ulna of the left elbow. The recommended treatment is conservative resection and bone grafting, as malignant change is extremely rare. CONCLUSION: Although very rare, intraosseous <b>neurilemmoma</b> should be taken under consideration in the differential diagnosis of painful, radiographically benign-appearing osseous tumor around the elbow...|$|E
40|$|Schwannoma, or <b>neurilemmoma,</b> is {{a benign}} nerve sheath tumor most {{commonly}} {{located in the}} soft tissue. Occasionally, Schwannomas involve osseous structures.

We present the case of a <b>neurilemmoma</b> affecting both the distal fibula and tibia. Although rare, intraosseous <b>neurilemmoma</b> should be included on the differential diagnosis of painful, radiographically benign-appearing lesions arising in long bones...|$|E
40|$|Schwannomas or <b>neurilemmomas</b> are benign {{neoplasms}} of the Schwann {{cells in}} neural sheaths. They may arise in any nerve {{in the body}} and occur frequently {{in the head and neck}} region or extremities. While breast lumps and schwannomas are very common, mammary schwannomas are exceedingly scarce with, 30 cases reported in the literature. We describe a case of a breast schwannoma in a 37 -year-old female and review the literature surrounding this rare occurrence...|$|R
40|$|Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF 2) is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder {{characterized by the}} occurrence of bilateral acoustic neuromas, as well as meningiomas and schwannomas. The gene locus for NF 2 resides on chromosome 22 q 12 and has been cloned recently. Neurilemmomatosis is characterized by multiple cutaneous and spinal <b>neurilemmomas</b> without other signs of NF 1 or NF 2. Many cases with this disorder include the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis or other rare diseases unexplained by current nosology. In this study, we analyzed the peripheral leukocytes and tissue from cutaneous <b>neurilemmomas</b> of seven patients with neurilemmomatosis using DNA markers for different regions of chromosome 22. We detected allelic losses in three of seven tumors from seven patients with a probe for the NF 2 region of the long arm of chromosome 22 and the germ-line mutations in two of three tumors from the same three patients. Mutations in the NF 2 gene were a deletion from at least codon 334 to 579 and G insertion at codon 42. We conclude that the neurilemmomatosis locus lies within the NF 2 region and that these diseases might be identical...|$|R
40|$|Schwannomas (<b>neurilemmomas)</b> are benign tumors {{arising from}} {{peripheral}} nerve sheaths.

They are rarely diagnosed preoperatively. The risk of nerve damage after excision is high under general anesthesia. In this article, a case of brachial plexus schwannoma was presented and the excision with local anesthesia was shown to prevent the nerve injury.     ...|$|R
40|$|Jugular foramen <b>neurilemmoma</b> is {{frequently}} manifested as a jugular foramen syndrome or extraaxial mass. <b>Neurilemmoma</b> {{arising from the}} cranial nerves of the foramen, although rare, may be manifestated as an intracranial or extracranial mass lesion. When the tumor is located only in the intracranium, it is often misdiagnosed as an acoustic neurinoma or a brainstem tumor because of their similarity in clinical or radiological findings.

40|$|Schwannomas (<b>neurilemmomas)</b> are benign tumors {{arising from}} the Schwann cells of the neural sheath. They are typically, well-encapsulated lesions which rarely adhere to the {{adjacent}} structures. In the chest, schwannomas are often seen within the posterior mediastinum and commonly originating along intercostal nerves. Several operative approaches have previously been described for the resection of these tumors, including thoracoscopic techniques and posterolateral thoracotomy.

40|$|Schwannomas (<b>neurilemmomas)</b> are benign neurogenic tumours of {{peripheral}} nerves. They {{originate from}} Schwann cells, which form the neural sheath. Although Schwannomas and neuroﬁbromas {{are the most}} common primary peripheral nerve tumours, Schwannomas are rarely observed in ophthalmic areas. When they occur, ocular Schwannomas are usually located in the orbit, uveal tract and conjunctiva. Isolated eyelid Schwannomas are reported infrequently. Herein, we describe a case of eyelid Schwannoma in a 50 -year-old man. The diagnosis of Schwannoma was made after the eyelid mass was removed by excisional biopsy so this entity {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis of eyelid margin tumours...|$|R

40|$|A 34 -year-old man {{presented}} with a 5 -year history of paraesthesia of the right palm and the right middle and ring fingers. This paraesthesia was exacerbated by elevation of the right arm. A tumour was palpable in the subclavicular fossa. As magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated a neurogenic tumour origi-nating from the brachial plexus, a diagnosis of tho-racic outlet syndrome caused by a <b>neurilemmoma</b> in the pectoralis minor space was made. Pathological examination showed the tumour to be a benign <b>neurilemmoma.</b> There have been only three previous case reports of neurilemmomas as causes of thoracic outlet syndrome worldwide, {{and this is the}} first report of a <b>neurilemmoma</b> originating from the late-ral fascicles of the brachial plexus in the pectoralis minor space causing thoracic outlet syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Two {{examples}} of intracerebral <b>neurilemmoma</b> {{occurred in the}} absence of von Recklinghausen's disease. The first case was unique because the patient was clinically asymptomatic, and the second case was unusual with a combination of oligodendroglioma and <b>neurilemmoma</b> in the same mass. The latter lesion arising in persons without stigmata of neurofibromatosis has not been described. The nature of nerve sheath neoplasms in both instances has been verified by electron-microscopy. Clinical features of this rare neoplasm differ from those of acoustic or other cranial nerve tumour, particularly in relation to age and sex. Intracerebral <b>neurilemmoma</b> has been found most often in the first two decades of life and more often in males. Seizures and paresis, although non-specific are common signs and symptoms.
