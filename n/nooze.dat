40|$|An iconic {{case study}} in grammaticalization {{research}} {{is the development of}} the going to-construction. In this talk, I look at new evidence with respect to its early emancipation out of a compositional combination of going with a purposive adjunct. I argue that the emergence of a grammaticalized futurate construction was made possible through an analogical model involving a number of verbs such as intend, begin and desire. While recent studies have already amply stressed the primacy of analogy (e. g. Fischer 2007, De Smet 2009) the going to-construction has played an iconic role in the argumentation of proponents of the primacy of reanalysis, with, most recently, Traugott’s (2011) arguments against external analogy via periphrastic auxiliaries suggested in Fischer (2007). Alternatively, Garrett (2012) argues grammaticalization occurred via an internal analog, the free adjunct going to meaning ‘turn to’. Complementing his account, I argue that an external analogical model was also present. 	The original compositional combination of [[go][allative motion]] + [[be Ving][imperfectivity/on-goingness]] + [[to Inf][purpose adjunct]] is illustrated in (1). (1) 	As they were goynge to bringe hym there, [...] . cometh one Piers Venables [...] . (1439 [MED]) Note that already in this early example, spatial motion is demoted through the integration of the goal location within the infinitival phrase (there). An early example of the extended construction, where the motion + purpose adjunct-reading is no longer available, is (2). (2) 	Hee tooke his owne garters off; and as {{he was going to make}} a <b>nooze,</b> I watch’d my time and ranne away. (1611 [taken from Garrett 2012]) I argue this extension was motivated by existing analogs such as those in (3) -(4). (3) 	Seeing you are beginnyng to tell a tale, I cannot tell howe longe you woulde [...] . remember my questions. (1572) (4) 	The duke of Aniowe was entending to make a voyage. (1523) Besides the formal similarity of the examples and the chronological evidence, there is also semantic evidence that [begin/intend/ [...] . to Inf] + [be Ving] are plausible analogs, as they too conveyed planned action, either already started (beginning) or well contemplated (intending). Theoretically, I draw attention to a stage in the development where [be going to] is a member of two constructional schemas, the original one, and that of the analog, where dual membership has to be distinguished from ambiguous membership (a refinement of De Smet’s [2009] notion of recategorization). This stage, which can elegantly be represented in a constructionist framework, allows for internal analogy (as in Garret 2012) and external analogy to reinforce each other for a while before actualization and subsequent automation drive the grammaticalized construction away from its origins. status: publishe...|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} morning Mr. Goodenough and Frank {{were called to}} the door by the noise of a passing crowd, and to their horror saw a man being taken to sacrifice. He was preceded by men beating drums, his hands were pinioned behind him. A sharp thin knife was passed through his cheeks, to which his lips were <b>noozed</b> like the figure 8. One ear was cut off and carried before him, the other hung to his head by {{a small piece of}} skin. There were several gashes in his back, and a knife was thrust under each shoulder blade. He was led by a cord passed through a hole bored in his nose. Frank ran horror stricken back into the house, and sat for a while with his hand over his eyes as if to shut out the ghastly spectacle.|$|R
