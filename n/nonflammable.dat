5|$|Argon has {{approximately}} the same solubility in water as oxygen and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than nitrogen. Argon is colorless, odorless, <b>nonflammable</b> and nontoxic as a solid, liquid or gas.

5|$|Six {{nonmetals}} occur naturally as monatomic noble gases: helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and {{the radioactive}} radon (Rn). They comprise {{a group of}} chemical elements with very similar properties.

5|$|The NFPA 704 {{standard}} rates {{compressed oxygen}} gas as nonhazardous to health, <b>nonflammable</b> and nonreactive, but an oxidizer. Refrigerated liquid oxygen (LOX) {{is given a}} health hazard rating of 3 (for increased risk of hyperoxia from condensed vapors, and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite), and all other ratings {{are the same as}} the compressed gas form.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} are colorless, odorless, tasteless, and <b>nonflammable</b> under {{standard}} conditions. They were once labeled group0 in {{the periodic table}} because it was believed they had a valence of zero, meaning their atoms cannot combine {{with those of other}} elements to form compounds. However, it was later discovered some do indeed form compounds, causing this label to fall into disuse.|$|E
25|$|In health-care environments, the {{prevention}} of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning. <b>Nonflammable</b> alcohol vapor in CO2 systems is used in health care environments where medical electronics would be adversely affected by aerosolized chlorine or other caustic compounds.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{drinking}} bird's appearance and classification as a toy {{there is a}} potential danger of thin shards of glass should the bulb break. Early models were often filled with highly flammable substances, though the fluid in later versions is <b>nonflammable.</b> Dichloromethane can irritate the skin on contact and the lungs if inhaled. It may be dangerous to people with pre-existing heart, liver, or nervous system conditions and is a suspected carcinogen.|$|E
500|$|While {{the fire}} bore marked {{similarities}} to the 1957 fire, {{the level of}} contamination was less severe because the HEPA filters in the exhaust system did not burn through (After the 1957 fire, the filter material was changed from cellulose to <b>nonflammable</b> fiberglass). Had the filters failed or the roof (which sustained heavy fire damage) been breached, the release {{could have been more}} severe than the 1957 fire. About [...] of plutonium was in the storage area where the fire occurred, and about [...] total plutonium was in building 776/777.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{experiment}} began to record shower data, lightning ignited the flammable liquid {{of one of}} the counters. [...] Local firemen quickly extinguished the resulting fire before it spread to nearby trees, which were soaked with rain water. [...] Because the trees played an essential role in suppressing atmospheric convection that would degrade telescopic observations, Harvard and MIT carried out tense negotiations, until an elaborate system of fire protection was installed, and the experiment was allowed to resume. [...] To eliminate the threat of fire, Clark, Frank Scherb and William B. Smith created a [...] "factory" [...] that made <b>nonflammable</b> plastic scintillator disks, whose thickness was [...] and whose diameter was approximately [...]|$|E
2500|$|Tetrachloroethylene is an {{excellent}} solvent for organic materials. [...] Otherwise it is volatile, highly stable, and <b>nonflammable.</b> For these reasons, it is widely used in dry cleaning. It {{is also used to}} degrease metal parts in the automotive and other metalworking industries, usually as a mixture with other chlorocarbons. It appears in a few consumer products including paint strippers and spot removers.|$|E
2500|$|Freon is an odorless, colorless, <b>nonflammable,</b> and noncorrosive {{chlorofluorocarbon}} and hydrochlorofluorocarbon refrigerant, {{which is}} used in air conditioning, refrigeration and some automatic fire-fighting systems. Refrigerators from the late 19th century until 1929 used toxic gases, ammonia, methyl chloride, and sulfur dioxide as refrigerants. This new [...] "miracle compound" [...] was co-invented in 1929 by Charles Midgley Jr. and Charles Kettering.|$|E
2500|$|Ethanol {{has proven}} to be an {{effective}} topical sanitizer against MRSA. Quaternary ammonium can be used in conjunction with ethanol to increase the duration of the sanitizing action. The prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning. <b>Nonflammable</b> alcohol vapor in [...] NAV-CO2 systems have an advantage, as they do not attack metals or plastics used in medical environments, and do not contribute to antibacterial resistance.|$|E
2500|$|For {{more than}} a century, the land now {{occupied}} by the Watergate complex belonged to the Gas Works of the Washington Gas Light Company, which produced [...] "manufactured gas" [...] (a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and other flammable and <b>nonflammable</b> gases) for heating, cooking, and lighting throughout the city. Gas production ceased at the site in 1947, and the plant was demolished shortly thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|The Expansion Engine {{can offer}} {{significant}} advantages here, in particular for lower power ratings of 2 to 100kW: with expansion ratios of 1:5, the theoretical efficiency reaches 15%, {{which is in}} the range of ORC systems. The Expansion Engine uses water as working fluid which is simple, cheap, not toxic, <b>nonflammable</b> and not corrosive. It works at pressure near and below atmospheric. So that sealing is not a problem. And it is a simple machine, implying cost effectiveness. Researchers from the University of Southampton / UK are currently developing a modern version of Watt's engine in order to generate energy from waste steam and waste heat. They improved the theory, demonstrating that theoretical efficiencies of up to 17.4% (and actual efficiencies of 11%) are possible.|$|E
2500|$|But {{many other}} {{sections}} of the original 1860s grade were harder to improve on, notably over the Sierra Nevada between Colfax, California, and Reno, Nevada. The newer second track follows a better route here and there, but the original route changed little (except {{for the removal of}} the [...] wooden snowsheds, or their replacement by <b>nonflammable</b> concrete ones) until the 1993 abandonment of the 6.7-mile section of the Track No. 1 crossing of the summit between Norden and Eder which includes the original [...] Summit Tunnel (No. 6). Traffic was sent instead over the easier-to-maintain Track No. 2 and through the [...] tunnel called “The Big Hole” (No. 41) which had been driven under Mt. Judah a mile south of the Pass when that portion of the line was double tracked in 1925. Aside from those modifications the Sierra grade looks much the same to train passengers as it did when the line opened in 1868.|$|E

During these years he founded the Cellulose Products Company demonstrating that cellulose acetate could be used in producing <b>nonflammable</b> wire insulation and artificial silk. The company didn't do well financially, and when it was dissolved, Eastman Kodak purchased the company's patents for the first <b>nonflammable</b> motion picture film and the Lustron Company bought the artificial silk patents becoming the only American manufacturer of acetate silk.|$|E

50|$|Early in the 20th century Dexter {{became the}} focus of {{research}} that would confirm the existence of an abundance of naturally occurring and readily available helium. In May 1903, a newly drilled natural gas well was found to contain a <b>nonflammable</b> gas. Researchers at the University of Kansas found the “Dexter gas” contained only 15 percent methane and 72 percent nitrogen, causing the gas to be <b>nonflammable.</b> In addition they discovered helium within an “inert residue” in the gas and, after expanding their research to other wells throughout Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma, published a paper in 1907 saying that helium could be extracted from natural gas. Helium did not have any practical applications at the time, but by 1917 the federal government was sponsoring extensive research into the possibility of using helium in airships.|$|E
