By contrast, Percy, however, did not favour an entry into the luxury market, and the Riley Engine Company had been renamed PR Motors to be a high-volume supplier of engines and components. Although the rest of the Riley companies would go on to become part of Nuffield and then BMC, PR Motors remained independent.

As a modern hydrological modelling, it is composed of two parts: (i) the system for data and results visualization based on the Geographic Information System uDig and (ii) the component based modelling system. All the system is based on Java because of its portability. Java is a modern and mature language aware of the web and has features such as multithreading that are essential to build scalable modelling platform. There are a few open source frameworks available that allow adaptation for our task, such as the GeoTools project by the Open GIS Consortium, representing a solid foundation for spatial analysis. OMS was chosen for facilitating model connectivity because of it low invasiveness in code practice and capability in production of leaner and more descriptive modelling code. uDig as visualization/GIS platform, including GIS services, and its integration with the JGrass GIS, developed by [URL] offers a spatial toolbox which contains the features previously offered by JGrass. Compared to traditional hydrological models, which are built upon monolithic code, JGrass-NewAge allows for multiple modelling solutions for the same physical process, provided they share similar input and outputs constraints. Modeling components are connected {{by means of a}} concise scripting language NewAge-JGrass components can be grouped in several categories. The geomorphic and DEM analyses which solves the problem of basin delineation; the tools for making spatial extrapolation/interpolation of the meteorological data; the estimation of the radiation forcing; the estimation of evapotranspiration; the estimation of the runoff production; the channel routing and tools for automatic model parameter calibration such as DREAM, Particle Swarm and LUCA. <b>NewAge</b> requires interpolated meteorological variables (such as air temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity) as input data for each hillslope. They can be computed by a deterministic or geostatistic approaches. The energy model includes both, shortwave and longwave radiation calculation components for each hillslope. The first implements algorithms that take into account shade and complex topography and cloud cover. Evapotraspiration can be modelled using two different solutions: the Fao-Evapotraspiration model and the Priestley-Taylor model. A snow melting and snow water equivalent model is also part of the system. Duffy's model and Hymod model are the runoff production models implemented in <b>NewAge.</b> In both cases the model is applied for each hillslope. Finally, the discharge generated at each hillslope is routed to each associated stream link. Modeling solutions (connections of different components) are applied in three different river basin and verifications against measured data (discharge, radiation fluxes, snow water equivalent) are presented by using traditional goodness of fitting indices. ...|$|E
40|$|Direction {{sensitive}} direct {{detection of}} Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) as dark matter {{would provide an}} unambiguous non-gravitational signature of dark matter (DM). The diurnal variation of DM signal due to earth's rotation around its own axis can be a significant signature for galactic WIMPs. Because of particular orientation of earth's axis of rotation with respect to WIMP wind direction, the apparent direction of WIMP wind as observed at a detector can alter widely over a day. In this work we calculate the directional detection rates with their daily and yearly modulations in earth-bound dark matter experiments considering detailed features of the geometry and dynamics of the earth-sun system along with the solar motion in galactic frame. A separate halo model namely the dark disc model other than the usual standard halo model for dark matter halo is also considered and the results for two models are compared. We demonstrate the results for two types of gas detectors namely DRIFT (target material CS 2) and <b>NEWAGE</b> (target material CF 4) that use Time Projection Chamber techniques for measuring directionality of the recoil nucleus.

Na prvoj nekropoli Kod križa otkriveno je 97 grobova, a na nekropoli sedamdeset metara zapadnije 23 groba. Nekropole se vremenski mogu smjestiti u razdoblje od 13. do 18. st. Nekropola Kod križa najugoistoku se prostirala prelw kamene gomile, u kojoj je, uzjedanaest kasnosrednjovjelwvnih grobova, otkriven i prapovijesni grob, te dijelovi vrča iz ranog brončanog doba. Planning the Zagreb -Zadar -Split highway, {{passing by}} {{the village of}} Koprivno, to pass over archaeological sites with a stone mound and two necropolises, {{generated}} the need of protective researches. At the first necropolis, Kod križa, there have been excavated 97 graves, and at the other one, 70 meters further to the west, 23 graves. They can be dated to the 13 th- 18 th centuries. The Kod križa necropolis spread to the south-east Over a stone mound in which, besides eleven medieval graves, {{there have also been}} discovered a prehistoric grave and fragments of an early Bronze Age jug. 1. KOD KRIŽA CEMETERY Before the research, there was visible a larger undecorated slab-shaped tombstone. At the site there were also visible several graves with drystone crowns. The main feature of the site is a trunk-shaped tumbstone, made of stećak tombstone fragments. The grave:S western side is made of a slab-shaped stećak, decorated with half-moon and circle relieves and two incised crosses. Above {{the western part of the}} grave there is a larger stone cross that gave name to the site (Kod križa = By the Cross). At the eastern part of the stone cross there is relief image ofan anthropomorphic cross and two circles lrosettes. At this late Middle-Age and New Age necropolis there have been found 97 graves. To the south-east the cemetery spread over the stone mound, and to the north and the west under the country road. The terrain on which the cemetery is located is markedly rocky, and most of the graves are cut in the bedrock. Most of the graves have, cut in the bedrock, built grave architecture, that is, they are lined with vertically set stone slabs. Occasional/y, instead of slabs, lining is made of amorphous cut rocks. Such grave is covered with several slabs from the feet to the head. Most oft he graves had a drystone crown, oval or rectangular, under which there is the grave. Some of them in the crown had a head-stone, even two head-stones. The present All Saints 2 ̆ 7 Church, at the local cemetery, was built at the end of the 19 " century, most probably on the site of an older one. At the entrance to the cemetery, north-west of the church, there are visible older graves, identical by the way of building to some of the graves of the Kod križa necropolis. Most of the grave goods fund at the Kod križa necropolis are needles, clothing buckles and simple buttons. All of them are characteristic for the late Middle Age. Dated to the New Age are shoe-sole guards, and coins -six coins of the Spanish king Carlos II (ruled 1665 - 1 700) from the child grave G 79. Since the coins are perforated, they were obviously used as decoration, a part of a necklace. ln the graves there have been also found five Turkish silver coins -the akche, and two Roman co ins, of one of them only a small fragment. The Roman coins make incidental finds, whereas the Turkish akche were official money in these parts at the time of the Turkish conquest. Most probably, they were struck in Bosnia in the 162 ̆ 7 " century. Turkish silver coins, remains of wool clothing with buckles, the grave architecture -crowned graves, as well as the historic sources, indicate that a part oft he graves can be related to the Vlachs, Turkish subjects, who settled the deserted area of Dugopolje -Koprivno in the first half oft he 16 " 2 ̆ 7 century. Burials at the Kod križa necropolis started in the 16 th and ended in the 18 th century. 2. STONE MO UND Besides this stone mound, there are several more in Koprivno, and several empty graves in smaller mounds are visible above Nazlići. Our stone mollnd is situated south-east of the necropolis, its base oval shaped, 19. 5 m in radius, and up to 1. 4 m in height. Next to the already known late Middle-Age and <b>NewAge</b> graves (eleven graves) at the eastern end of the mould, there has been excavated a pre-historic grave (G S 5 A), shaped like a stone trunk. The grave, 90 x 40 cm in size, contained bones of a male person (50 - 55 years old) buried in the bent position and no grave goods.

The only pre-historic grave in che moOuld of Koprivno is found at its eastern end. As the first one created, it should have been located closer to its centre. It has been shifted to its end, probably, by moving of the mound westward, because of clearing of the land for agriculture, or because ofeleven new burials in the late Middle Ages. Almost in the centre of the mound, 100 cm deep, there have been found fragments of a black clay jug. This is probably a vessel used for the burial cult purposes. The jug is identical to the similar examples from mounds around the spring, and belongs to the early Bronze Age, indicating the time of building of the mound and the burial. In the later Middle Ages, the mound was used in widening of the nearby necropolis. 3. KOPRiVNO -CEMETERY BY THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE JAKOV NAZLIĆ 2 ̆ 7 S FENCE Another necropolis in Koprivno is situated about 70 m west of the Kod križa site. 23 graves have been excavated there. Most of the graves are oriented E -W, with minor deviations, and five oft hem NE -SW One third of the graves are buried in the soil, and others cut in the bedrock. Graves 6, 9, 18 and 19 have no sepulchral architecture. Others have the common sepulchral architecture, consisting of stone slabs, more rarely of amorphous rocks used to line the grave. Grave 10 stands out by being located above the grave II and by the deceased person 2 ̆ 7 s head being separated from the rest of the body with a stone slab. The first impression was that the head was buried alone, without the body. Four graves (5, 9, J 3, 15) have been empty, with no traces of a body.

Such "poor utilisation" of the graves could indicate short duration of the necropolis, not more than a century. Finds have been found in female graves only (three-bead earrings, rings with coiled thickenings, coins).
