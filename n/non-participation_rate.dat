40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{gender differences}} in hourly earnings in Greece using three Household Budget Surveys (1988, 1994, 1999). During this period the aggregate gender earnings gap remained almost stable, amounting to less than a fifth of male earnings {{in the public sector}} and around a quarter of male earnings in the private sector of the economy. In most cases, women have better educational qualifications but men more years of potential experience. Using a number of decomposition techniques, it is shown that in the more competitive private sector of the economy, where wages {{are more likely to be}} determined by productivity, around three quarters of the observed gap should be attributed to discrimination. This finding, combined with the substantially higher incidences of unemployment and involuntary labour force <b>non-participation</b> <b>rates</b> of females, implies that despite the legislative progress in promoting equality of opportunity in recent decades, there is still a long way to go before true gender equality is established in the Greek labour market...|$|R
40|$|Background: Public health {{monitoring}} depends on valid health and disability estimates {{in the population}} 65 + years. This is hampered by high <b>non-participation</b> <b>rates</b> in this age group. There is limited insight into size and direction of potential baseline selection bias. Methods: We analyzed baseline non-participation in a register-based random sample of 1481 inner-city residents 65 + years, invited to a health examination survey according to demographics available for the entire sample, self-report information as available and reasons for non-participation. One year after recruitment, non-responders were revisited to assess their reasons. Results: Five groups defined by participation status were differentiated: participants (N[*]=[*] 299), persons who had died or moved (N[*]=[*] 173), those who declined participation, but answered a short questionnaire (N[*]=[*] 384), those who declined participation and the short questionnaire (N[*]=[*] 324), and non-responders (N[*]=[*] 301). The results confirm substantial baseline selection bias with significant underrepresentation of persons 85 + years, persons in residential care or from disadvantaged neighborhoods, with lower education, foreign citizenship, or lower health-related quality of life. Finally, reasons for non-participation could be identified for 78 % of all non-participants, including 183 non-responders. Conclusion: A diversity in health problems and barriers to participation exists among non-participants. Innovative study designs are needed for public {{health monitoring}} in aging populations...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{unemployment}} and <b>non-participation</b> <b>rates</b> are higher, more disperse, and more stable in Europe {{than in the}} U. S. This paper helps understand what may cause this phenomenon. Specifically, it looks at the role of migration in regional differences. I analyze the adjustment mechanisms of regional labor markets in seven countries of continental Europe (Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, The Netherlands, and Portugal), and the United States. I develop a simple model to understand the role of migration in the adjustment mechanism and estimate comparative static parameters. Under demand shocks, migration elasticities are identified relative to other supply elasticities. I argue that comparative statics give more reliable results than the usual Vector Autoregression approach. I exclude part of the possible supply-induced variation in my analysis. According to the results, aggregate migration elasticities relative to other supply responses are significantly weaker in Europe than in the U. S. The differences are small for the economically most active cohorts, and the aggregate differences are driven primarily by the less active cohorts, both young and old. This suggests that the Europe-US differences in regional inequality are driven {{at least as much}} by stronger {{unemployment and}} non-participation responses than weaker migration. regional labor markets, migration, labor supply adjustment. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper quantifies {{the effects}} of the means-tested social welfare (insurance) program on {{individuals}} ’ savings behavior and portfolio choices by solving numerically a life-cycle model in the presence of social welfare and zero income risk. The paper shows that less wealthy households tend to either choose to quit the asset markets completely or increase the portfolio risk. Social welfare depresses savings through two channels: the jump effect induces poor households to increase current consumption dramatically; the gradual effect imposes a declining consumption-wealth ratio in wealth. Both effects can drive the non-participation in asset markets. Serving like a put option, social welfare gives less wealthy households the incentive to increase the portfolio risk conditional on participation. Last but not least, the paper calibrates the <b>non-participation</b> <b>rate</b> by using the PSID data and shows that social welfare plays a crucial role in explaining the non-participation puzzle in asset markets...|$|E

Of the remaining 97, 82 provided blood samples and 29 had serum neutralizing antibody levels above 200 mIU/ml. Afer adjusting for <b>non-participation</b> <b>rates,</b> the proportion considered non-immune (no IgG in saliva and < or = 200 mIU/ml in serum) was 9 % overall, ranging from 6 % in vaccinated children to 20 % in unvaccinated children.

Thirty (79 %) had a fourfold or greater rise in serum neutralizing antibody and 28 (88 %) developed IgG antibody in saliva. Half of the children considered non-immune by antibody testing would have been overlooked in a selective vaccination programme targeted at those without a history of prior vaccination. A programme targeted at all school children should substantially reduce the proportion non-immune since a primary or booster response was achieved in three quarters of previously vaccinated children with low antibody levels and in all unvaccinated children. While it is feasible to screen a school-sized population for immunity to measles relatively quickly using a salivary IgG assay, a simple inexpensive field assay would need to be developed before salivary screening and selective vaccination could substitute for universal vaccination of populations at risk of measles outbreaks. The salivary IgG assay provided a sensitive measure of a booster response to vaccination...|$|R

40|$|Health {{professional}} education {{is experiencing a}} cultural shift towards student-centered education. Although we are now challenging our traditional training methods, our methods for evaluating {{the impact of the}} training on the learner remains largely unchanged. What is not typically measured is student-centered value; whether it was 'worth' what the learner paid. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} apply a method of calculating student-centered value, applied to the context of a change in teaching methods within a health professional program. This study took place over the first semester of the third year of the Bachelor of Physiotherapy at Monash University, Victoria, Australia, in 2014. The entire third year cohort (n = 78) was invited to participate. Survey based design was used to collect the appropriate data. A blended learning model was implemented; subsequently students were only required to attend campus three days per week, with the remaining two days comprising online learning. This was compared to the previous year's format, a campus-based face-to-face approach where students attended campus five days per week, with the primary outcome-Value to student. Value to student incorporates, user costs associated with transportation and equipment, the amount of time saved, the price paid and perceived gross benefit. Of the 78 students invited to participate, 76 completed the post-unit survey (<b>non-participation</b> <b>rate</b> 2. 6 %). Based on Value to student the blended learning approach provided a $ 1, 314. 93 net benefit to students. Another significant finding was that the perceived gross benefit for the blended learning approach was $ 4014. 84 compared to the campus-based face-to-face approach of $ 3651. 72, indicating that students would pay more for the blended learning approach. This paper successfully applied a novel method of calculating student-centered value. This is the first step in validating the value to student outcome. Measuring economic value to the student may be used as a way of evaluating effective change in a modern health professional curriculum. This could extend to calculate total value, which would incorporate the economic implications for the educational providers. Further research is required for validation of this outcome...|$|E

Compared with non-participants, participants were older (44 versus 41 years, P < 0. 001). Among participants, 85 % rated their health as 'good' or 'very good', compared with 78 % among non-participants (P < 0. 001); 88 % of the participants reported fewer than 10 days sickness absence in the previous year, compared with 86 % of the non-participants (P < 0. 05).

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{evolution}} of strategic play where players drawn from a finite well-mixed population are offered {{the opportunity to play}} in a public goods game. All players accept the offer. However, due to the possibility of unforeseen circumstances, each player has a fixed probability of being unable to participate in the game, unlike similar models which assume voluntary participation. We first study how prescribed stochastic opting-out affects cooperation in finite populations. Moreover, in the model, cooperation is favored by natural selection over both neutral drift and defection if return on investment exceeds a threshold value defined solely by the population size, game size, and a player's probability of opting-out. Ultimately, increasing the probability that each player is unable to fulfill her promise of participating in the public goods game facilitates natural selection of cooperators. We also use adaptive dynamics to study the coevolution of cooperation and opting-out behavior. However, given rare mutations minutely different from the original population, an analysis based on adaptive dynamics suggests that the over time the population will tend towards complete defection and non-participation, and subsequently, from there, participating cooperators will stand a chance to emerge by neutral drift. Nevertheless, increasing the probability of <b>non-participation</b> decreases the <b>rate</b> at which the population tends towards defection when participating.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of a population-based evaluation of screening {{for prostate cancer}} in men with a raised familial risk was investigated by studying reasons for <b>non-participation</b> and uptake <b>rates</b> according to postal recruitment and clinic contact. The levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and the positive predictive values (PPV) for cancer in men referred with a raised PSA and in those biopsied were analysed. First-degree male relatives (FDRs) were identified through index cases (ICs) : patients living in two regions of England and diagnosed with prostate cancer at age ⩽ 65 years from 1998 to 2004. First-degree relatives were eligible if they were aged 45 – 69 years, living in the UK and had no prior diagnosis of prostate cancer. Postal recruitment was low (45 of 1687 ICs agreed to their FDR being contacted: 2. 7 %) but this was partly due to ICs not having eligible FDRs. A third of ICs in clinic had eligible FDRs and 49 % (192 out of 389) agreed to their FDR(s) being contacted. Of 220 eligible FDRs who initially consented, 170 (77. 3 %) had a new PSA test taken and 32 (14. 5 %) provided a previous PSA result. Among the 170 PSA tests, 10 % (17) were ⩾ 4 [*]ng[*]ml− 1 and 13. 5 % (23) tests above the age-related cutoffs. In 21 men referred, five were diagnosed with prostate cancer (PPV 24 %; 95 % CI 8, 47).

40|$|Background: Headache {{disorders}} are common worldwide, causing pain and disability. India {{appears to have}} a very high prevalence of migraine, and of other headache disorders in line with global averages. Our objective was to estimate the burdens attributable to these disorders in order to inform health policy. Methods: In a door-to-door survey, biologically unrelated adults (18 – 65 years) were randomly sampled from urban and rural areas of Bangalore and interviewed by trained researchers. The validated structured questionnaire enquired into several aspects of burden. Results: Of 2, 329 participants (<b>non-participation</b> <b>rate</b> 7. 4 %), 1, 488 (63. 9 %; 621 male, 867 female) reported headache in the preceding year. Symptom burden was high. Migraine (1 -year prevalence 25. 2 %) occurred on average on 28 days/ year but, in 38. 0 % of cases (ie, 9. 6 % of adults), on ≥ 3 days/month (≥ 10 % of days). All causes of headache on ≥ 15 days/ month (prevalence 3. 0 %) occurred on a mean of 245 days/year. Both these and migraine were rated severe in intensity. Participants with headache lost 4. 3 % of productive time; those with migraine lost 5. 8 % (equating to 1. 5 % fromthe adult population). Lost paid worktime accounted for 40 % of this, probably detracting directly from GDP. We estimated population-level disability attributable to migraine using the disability weight from GBD 2010 for the ictal state (0. 433). Mean disability per person with migraine was 1. 8 %, reducing the functional capacity of the entire adult population by 0. 46 %. Fewer than one quarter of participants with headache had engaged with health-care services for headache in the last year. Actual expenditure on headache care was greatest among those with headache on ≥ 15 days/month (especially probable medication-overuse headache), but otherwise not high. Expressed willingness to pay for effective treatment for headache was higher, signalling dissatisfaction with current treatments. Conclusions: In Karnataka State, southern India, prevalent headache disorders, especially migraine, give rise to commensurately heavy burdens. Limited access to health care fails to alleviate these. Structured headache services, with their basis in primary care, are the most efficient, effective, affordable and equitable solution. They could be implemented within the health-care infrastructure of India and are likely to be cost-saving. This solution requires political will, itself dependent on awareness.

40|$|STUDY QUESTION: Is it {{feasible}} {{to evaluate a}} personalized e-therapy program (Internet based) for women during fertility treatment aimed to reduce the chance of having clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and/or depression after unsuccessful assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) ? STUDY ANSWER: The evaluation of a personalized e-therapy program is feasible, reflected by good acceptability and integration within current guidelines, but adjustments to the e-therapy program and study design of the RCT {{have to be made}} to enhance demand, practicality and efficacy. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Internet-based interventions are promising in reducing psychological distress, especially when treatment is personalized to specific risk profiles of patients. However in fertility care, the beneficial effects of personalized e-therapy on psychological distress and its implementation in daily clinical care still have to be evaluated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: To evaluate the feasibility of a personalized e-therapy program, we conducted a two-arm, parallel group, single-blind feasibility randomized controlled trial with a 1 : 1 allocation. Feasibility was assessed in terms of demand, acceptability, practicality, implementation, integration and limited efficacy. Women were included between 1 February 2011 and 1 June 2013. Women in the control group received care as usual, whereas women in the intervention group received in addition to their usual care access to a personalized e-therapy program. Women were monitored until 3 months after the start of their first ART cycle. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In a university hospital in the Netherlands women who were screened as at risk for emotional adjustment problems and intended to start their first ART cycle were invited, and of them 120 were randomized. Of these women, 48 % in the intervention group were compliant to the intervention. Outcome measures associated with the feasibility to analyse this e-therapy program within an RCT were assessed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: It is {{feasible to}} evaluate a personalized e-therapy program within an RCT. The acceptability was good, as was the integration within current clinical guidelines and care. However, the demand reflected by a participation rate of 44 % was low, since most women declined participation because they felt no need for support at that moment. The practicality of the intervention was moderate illustrated by a relatively high dropout rate (30 %) due to practical concerns. The intervention was effective, shown by a reduction in the percentage women having clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and/or depression in the compliant intervention group compared with the control group 3 months after the first ART cycle; risk difference of 24 % (95 % CI: 2 - 46 %; ITALIC! P = 0. 03). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The large <b>non-participation</b> <b>rate</b> (56 %) needs further evaluation. This also could have influenced results on limited efficacy. Barriers for participation could be assessed more in-depth. Moreover, approximately 30 % dropped out. This percentage is comparable with other e-health studies. Finally, this is a single-centre study. Generalizability could be enlarged by a multi-centre approach. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In clinical fertility care, personalizing an e-therapy program to the patients' risk profile is promising and feasible. However, in future studies, we recommend modification of the study protocol by for example offering the intervention to the preferred moment in the treatment process. Moreover, adjustment of the study protocol tailored to the found barriers and facilitators is needed. When performing a multi-centre consecutive RCT to assess the effectiveness of personalized e-therapy in fertility care, the findings of this study, for example concerning the preferred timing or reasons for non-participation, could be helpful.

40|$|Background: The European Randomised {{study of}} Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) has shown {{significant}} reductions in prostate cancer mortality after 9 years and 11 years of follow-up, but screening is controversial because of adverse {{events such as}} overdiagnosis. We provide updated results of mortality from prostate cancer with follow-up to 2010, with analyses truncated at 9, 11, and 13 years. Methods: ERSPC is a multicentre, randomised trial with a predefined centralised database, analysis plan, and core age group (55 - 69 years), which assesses prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in eight European countries. Eligible men aged 50 - 74 years were identified from population registries and randomly assigned by computer generated random numbers to screening or no intervention (control). Investigators were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was prostate cancer mortality in the core age group. Analysis was by intention to treat. We did a secondary analysis that corrected for selection bias due to non-participation. Only incidence and no mortality data at 9 years' follow-up are reported for the French centres. This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN 49127736. Findings: With data truncated at 13 years of follow-up, 7408 prostate cancer cases were diagnosed in the intervention group and 6107 cases in the control group. The rate ratio of prostate cancer incidence between the intervention and control groups was 1 · 91 (95 % CI 1 · 83 - 1 · 99) after 9 years (1 · 64 [1 · 58 - 1 · 69] including France), 1 · 66 (1 · 60 - 1 · 73) after 11 years, and 1 · 57 (1 · 51 - 1 · 62) after 13 years. The rate ratio of prostate cancer mortality was 0 · 85 (0 · 70 - 1 · 03) after 9 years, 0 · 78 (0 · 66 - 0 · 91) after 11 years, and 0 · 79 (0 · 69 - 0 · 91) at 13 years. The absolute risk reduction of death from prostate cancer at 13 years was 0 · 11 per 1000 person-years or 1 · 28 per 1000 men randomised, which is equivalent to one prostate cancer death averted per 781 (95 % CI 490 - 1929) men invited for screening or one per 27 (17 - 66) additional prostate cancer detected. After adjustment for <b>non-participation,</b> the <b>rate</b> ratio of prostate cancer mortality in men screened was 0 · 73 (95 % CI 0 · 61 - 0 · 88). Interpretation: In this update the ERSPC confirms a substantial reduction in prostate cancer mortality attributable to testing of PSA, with a substantially increased absolute effect at 13 years compared with findings after 9 and 11 years. Despite our findings, further quantification of harms and their reduction are still considered a prerequisite for the introduction of populated-based screening.
