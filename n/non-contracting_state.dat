50|$|Reciprocity {{reservation}} - {{some countries}} may {{choose not to}} limit the Convention to only awards from other contracting states, but may however limit application to awards from non-contracting states such that they will only apply it {{to the extent to}} which such a <b>non-contracting</b> <b>state</b> grants reciprocal treatment.|$|E
50|$|The Convention {{applies to}} {{contracting}} parties only, however {{in cases where}} a contracting party court has to confirm the ruling of a <b>non-contracting</b> <b>state,</b> they retain a duty to act {{within the confines of}} article 6. Such was the case in Pellegrini v Italy (2001), a case concerning the application of a Vatican ecclesiastical court ruling on a divorce case.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, {{because the}} U.S. has {{ratified}} the CISG, the CISG in the U.S. has {{the force of}} federal law and supersedes UCC-based state law under the Supremacy Clause. Among the U.S. reservations to the CISG is the provision that the CISG will apply only as to contracts with parties located in other CISG Contracting States, a reservation permitted by the CISG in Article 95. Therefore, in international contracts {{for the sale of}} goods between a U.S. entity and an entity of a Contracting State, the CISG will apply unless the contract's choice of law clause specifically excludes CISG terms. Conversely, in [...] "international" [...] contracts for the sale of goods between a U.S. entity and an entity of a <b>non-Contracting</b> <b>State,</b> to be adjudicated by a U.S. court, the CISG will not apply, and the contract will be governed by the domestic law applicable according to private international law rules.|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} taxation of foreigners - residents and non-residents - in the Czech republic. It explains {{the differences between}} cooperation with the States of the European Union, contracting and <b>non-contracting</b> <b>States.</b> The main aim is definition of basic differences and finding the ways to optimize the tax liability of foreigners. Attention is also moving in specific cases that are resolved by the agreements for the avoidance of double taxation between the Czech Republic and Slovakia or the Czech Republic and France...|$|R
50|$|On July 1, 2002, the International Criminal Court, a treaty-based court {{located in}} The Hague, {{came into being}} for the {{prosecution}} of war crimes committed on or after that date. Several nations, most notably the United States, China, Russia, and Israel, have criticized the court. The United States still participates as an observer. Article 12 of the Rome Statute provides jurisdiction over the citizens of <b>non-contracting</b> <b>states</b> {{in the event that}} they are accused of committing crimes in the territory of one of the state parties.|$|R
500|$|The {{contracting}} {{states to}} the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) are the states that have signed and ratified the international agreement banning all nuclear explosions in all environments. Technically {{they will not be}} [...] "parties" [...] until the treaty enters into force, at which point these states will also be Member States of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which comes into existence upon entry into force of the treaty. <b>Non-contracting</b> <b>states</b> are also listed, including those that are signatories and those are not. States Signatories are Members of the CTBTO Preparatory Commission.|$|R
5000|$|The case of Owusu v Jackson and Others {{before the}} European Court of Justice, was {{concerned}} with the relationship between Article 2 of the Brussels Convention and the scope of FNC within the European Community. In Owusu, the English Court of Appeal asked the ECJ whether it could stay a matter brought to it under Article 2 Brussels Convention pursuant to the English FNC rules. The Court held that the Brussels Convention was a mandatory set of rules designed to harmonise and so produce a predictable system throughout the EU. If states were able to derogate from the Convention using their domestic rules of civil procedure, this would deny a uniform result to proceedings based on forum selection. Hence, at 46. the ECJ held: the Brussels Convention precludes a court of a Contracting State from declining the jurisdiction conferred on it by Article 2 of that convention {{on the ground that}} a court of a <b>non-Contracting</b> <b>State</b> would be a more appropriate forum for the trial of the action even if the jurisdiction of no other Contracting State is in issue or the proceedings have no connecting factors to any other Contracting State.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{doctrine}} of forum non conveniens is unknown in Continental legal systems, Community law does not prevent English courts from preserving their discretion to stay proceedings, in conflicts involving a defendant domiciliary, {{in favor of more}} appropriate courts in a <b>non-Contracting</b> <b>State.</b> Where the provisions of the Brussels Convention do not address a legal question, the answer must be sought in the objectives and scheme of the Convention. The English Court of Appeals in Harrods properly understood that Community law does not require ritualistic reliance on the Convention 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction conferring provisions in cases involving a defendant domiciled in a Contracting State and the jurisdiction of a court in a <b>non-Contracting</b> <b>State...</b>|$|E
40|$|In The MSC Amsterdam, cargo was misdelivered from a {{container}} yard, {{after it had}} been discharged from the carrier’s ship. The liability for such misdelivery has been long-established, but {{the importance of the}} case lies in its consideration of how a carrier can limit the amount. There is, in Longmore LJ’s judgment, a considered analysis of when the Hague or Hague-Visby regimes (including the package limitation) can extend beyond discharge, and of the ability of carriers alternatively to limit their liability for post-discharge misdelivery, by express contractual provision. There is lengthy consideration of the application of the Hague-Visby Rules to carriage from South Africa (a <b>non-Contracting</b> <b>State</b> which has nonetheless enacted legislation bringing the Rules into force), and of assessment of damages for conversion, where there is a significant market rise after the initial conversion, but during the period of detention of the goods...|$|E
5000|$|Japan is -with India- one of {{only two}} <b>non-contracting</b> <b>states</b> to the {{convention}} to rank {{as one of the top}} ten destination countries for the abduction of American children. Moreover, there is a year by year increase in abduction cases. In 2009, 73 outstanding cases involving 104 children who have been abducted to or retained in Japan by parents were reported. [...] An additional 29 cases involve American parties in Japan with one parent denied access to their child. In the 2010 report 79 child abduction cases were mentioned involving 100 children. A State Department official stated in 2008 that no child has ever been returned to the United States from Japan as a result of diplomatic or legal means The official stated he knew of only three cases where children have returned to America, two involving reconciliation of parents, and one in which a 15-year-old child escaped to the American embassy.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout {{the history}} of the EPC, some <b>non-contracting</b> <b>States</b> have {{concluded}} cooperation agreements with the European Patent Organisation, known as extension or validation agreements. These states then became [...] "extension states" [...] or [...] "validation states", which means that European patents granted by the EPO may be extended to those countries through the payment of additional fees and completion of certain formalities. Such cooperation agreements are concluded by the President of the European Patent Office on behalf of the European Patent Organisation pursuant to , are not based on a [...] "direct application of the EPC but solely on national law modelled on the EPC", and exist to assist with the establishment of national property rights in these states. As is the case in EPO contracting states, the rights conferred to European patents validated/extended to these states are the same as national patents in those states. However, the extension of a European patent or patent application to these states is [...] "not subject to the jurisdiction of the EPO boards of appeal." ...|$|R
40|$|This Development {{offers a}} {{discussion}} {{and analysis of}} the most recent cases that have formulated a definition of 2 ̆ 2 habitual residence 2 ̆ 2 {{in the context of the}} Convention. As the definition has evolved, US courts have differed as to how much weight should be given to the various components of the definition. It is my contention that the Gitter Standard is the most comprehensive standard that thoroughly contemplates the acclimatization of the child. To define habitual residence, the first prong of the Gitter Standard asserts that courts should inquire into the last shared intent of those entitled to fix the child 2 ̆ 7 s residence. The second prong states that the court should determine whether the evidence 2 ̆ 2 unequivocally points to the conclusion that the child has acclimatized to the new environment. 2 ̆ 2 Taken together, the two prongs protect the child 2 ̆ 7 s best interest when it can be proven that the child has become acclimatized to his surroundings and is considered mature enough to contest his return to the country of habitual residence. The standard also takes into consideration the exceptions in Articles Twelve and Thirteen of the Convention by allowing the proven acclimatization of the child to trump parental intent. In the event that the child is a newborn, the Gitter Standard should be expanded to include the Delvoye Standard. This Development further asserts that in cases that were wrongly decided, habitual residence would have been correctly defined and properly assigned had the court applied the Gitter Standard. The first Section sets forth the definition of habitual residence created by the Mozes court and explains how the Gitter Standard expands upon the prior definition, by placing more emphasis on whether a child has become acclimated to his environment. The second Section discusses two recent cases that would have had a different outcome had the Gitter Standard been properly applied. The third Section explores how habitual residence is determined when one country is not a party to the Convention, as well as how <b>non-Contracting</b> <b>States</b> acknowledge the importance of a child 2 ̆ 7 s desires and level of acclimatization, which places their logic closely in line with that of the court in Gitter. Previous commentaries have acknowledged the need for a uniform standard, and this Development concludes by reexamining the reasons why the Gitter Standard is the standard that should be uniformly adopted...|$|R
