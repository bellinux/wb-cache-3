50|$|Certain <b>number</b> <b>formats</b> may {{be chosen}} for an {{application}} for convenience in programming, or because of certain advantages offered by the hardware for that <b>number</b> <b>format.</b> For instance, early processors did not natively support the IEEE floating point standard for representing fractional values, so integers were used to store representations {{of the real world}} values by applying a scale factor to the real value. By necessity, this was done in software, since the hardware did not support fractional value.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an open source floating-point adder andmultiplier implemented using a 36 -bit custom <b>number</b> <b>format</b> based onradix- 16 and optimized for the 7 -series FPGAs from Xilinx. Althoughthis <b>number</b> <b>format</b> is not {{identical to the}} single-precision IEEE- 754 format, the floating-point operators are designed {{in such a way}} thatthe numerical results for a given operation will be identical to theresult from an IEEE- 754 compliant operator with support forround-to-nearest even, NaNs and Infs, and subnormalnumbers. The drawback of this <b>number</b> <b>format</b> is that the rounding stepis more involved than in a regular, radix- 2 based operator. On theother hand, the use of a high radix means that the area costassociated with normalization and denormalization can be reduced,leading to a net area advantage for the custom <b>number</b> <b>format,</b> underthe assumption that support for subnormal numbers is required. The area of the floating-point adder in a Kintex- 7 FPGA is 261 sliceLUTs and the area of the floating-point multiplier is 235 slice LUTsand 2 DSP 48 E blocks. The adder can operate at 319 MHz and themultiplier can operate at a frequency of 305 MHz...|$|R
