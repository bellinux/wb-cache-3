25|$|On March 2 Kentucky {{traveled}} to Athens to for its second meeting with Georgia. Facing the largest second-half deficit of its so-far perfect season, Kentucky clamped down defensively, ripped off a 14 to 0 run and defeat Georgia 72 to 64. Georgia's Yante Maten tipped in a miss {{of his own}} shot on the second attempt to put the Bulldogs up 56 to 47 with just over 9 minutes remaining. Towns and Aaron Harrison were huge down the stretch, combining for 12 of the 14 points during the decisive run. Towns had seven, including a three-point play with 2:53 left that put Kentucky ahead to stay. Harrison chipped in with five, and Cauley-Stein {{came up with a}} huge dunk off a missed free throw to give the Wildcats a four-point play on one possession. On March 7 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to face Florida on senior night in the regular season finale. Kentucky embraced its milestone following the 67 to 50 victory over the Gators. The Wildcats gathered at midcourt and donned their blue T-shirts with 31-0 <b>Not</b> <b>Done</b> <b>Yet</b> in white. Kentucky became the first team from a Power 5 conference to achieve a perfect record during the regular season in over twenty-five years.|$|E
500|$|As {{the band}} entered 2016, Cain felt {{the future for}} the group was bright: [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>yet.</b> I think we got more music in us," [...] he told Substream Magazine in January 2016. Two months later the band {{announced}} their break-up with a statement that read in part, [...] "We {{have no idea what}} the future holds, but for now we are done." [...] The band embarked on the So Long, Farewell Tour across North America between May and September 2016 with original drummer Tony Thaxton returning. They performed their final, sold-out show at the Metro in Chicago on September 18, 2016. The group performed 36 songs — some dating back to their 2000 EP, Back to the Beat — while both Thaxton and Rivera sat in on drums.|$|E
500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>yet</b> figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am {{going to give you a}} little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E

I’ve been a big fan of Janet since 'Con-tro-ol!'". Later, Dupri said that the closer he got to Jackson and Mariah's duet, the more he knew where it should be at, elaborating that he felt it was going to happen. [...] "It depends on how quick my mind moves. We’re mixing records for [...] We’re <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>yet.</b> When I did Usher's My Way album, the last record I created was 'You Make Me Wanna...'. I'm thinking I might go back in, and I might tamper with it. [...] We gotta try to figure it out", he commented. However, the duet never came to fruition.|$|E

Some of them burst as they carried them, but the fibre packages remained intact, and the big boat was almost loaded when Austin, who was breathless, seated himself for a moment on her gunwale. He could see by the silvery gleam on the cloud bank's edge that the moon was coming through again, and he was glad of the fact, for he had stumbled and once fallen heavily under his burden when floundering through the strip of thorny brushwood which fringed the beach. Still, he agreed with Jefferson that it was not advisable to use the big blast-light any longer than was absolutely necessary, for they both had an unpleasant suspicion that they had <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>yet</b> with Funnel-paint. It was, indeed, for that reason they had made the search at night and used the surfboat, which could be paddled almost silently, instead of the launch, though Tom had repaired her boiler, and she was then lying alongside the Cumbria, with steam up, ready.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN, - Thanks {{for your}} letter and news. No - my BURNS is <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>yet,</b> {{it has led}} me so far afield that I cannot finish it; every time I think I see my way to an end, some new game (or perhaps wild goose) starts up, and away I go. And then, again, to be plain, I shirk {{the work of the}} {{critical}} part, shirk it as a man shirks a long jump. It is awful to have to express and differentiate BURNS in a column or two. O golly, I say, you know, it CAN'T be done at the money. All the more as I'm going write a book about it. RAMSAY, FERGUSSON, AND BURNS: AN ESSAY (or A CRITICAL ESSAY? but then I'm going to give lives of the three gentlemen, only the gist of the book is the criticism) BY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON, ADVOCATE. How's that for cut and dry? And I COULD write this book. Unless I deceive myself, I could even write it pretty adequately. I feel as if I was really in it, and knew the game thoroughly. You see what comes of trying to write an essay on BURNS in ten columns.|$|E

I, with my old police-office habits, set to the next day, {{and try to make}} some discoveries for myself. The sum of what I find out is this: Danville's mother is staying with General Berthelin's sister and {{daughter}} at Chalons, and Danville himself is expected to arrive every day to escort them all three to Paris, where the marriage-contract is to be signed at the general's house. Discovering this, and seeing that prompt action is now of the most vital importance, I undertake, as I told you, my employer's commission for Paris, depart with all speed, and stop here on my way. Wait! I have <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>yet.</b> All the haste I can make is not haste enough to give me a good start of the wedding party. On my road here, the diligence by which I travel is passed by a carriage, posting along at full speed.

He whirls by in a cloud of dust, but I am certain of him; and I say to myself what I now say again to you, no time is to be lost!" ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{we made a}} swift march, {{and thought}} {{ourselves}} pretty secure; but our work was <b>not</b> <b>done</b> <b>yet,</b> for on a sudden we saw ourselves under a necessity of fighting our way through a great body of Manchester's horse, who came galloping upon us over the moor. They had, as we suppose, been pursuing some of our broken troops which were fled before, and seeing us, they gave us a home charge. We received {{them as well as}} we could, but pushed to get through them, which at last we did with a considerable loss to them. However, we lost so many men, either killed or separated from us (for all could not follow the same way), that of our three regiments we could not be above 400 horse together when we got quite clear, and these were mixed men, some of one troop and regiment, some of another. Not that I believe many of us were killed in the last attack, for we had plainly the better of the enemy, but our design being to get off, some shifted for themselves one way and some another, in the best manner they could, and as their several fortunes guided them. Four hundred more of this body, as I afterwards understood, having broke through the enemy's body another way, kept together, and got into Pontefract Castle, and 300 more made northward and to Skipton, where the prince afterwards fetched them off.|$|E

[...] "Think of me alone, days and days, in the wood, waiting for you, working all the time; saying: 'Come quickly, Abel; come slow, Abel. O Abel, how long you are!

Rima!' And she will be there, listening, hid in the trees, wishing to be in your arms, wishing for your lips--oh, so glad, yet fearing to show herself. Do you know why? He told you--did he not?--that when he first saw her she was standing before him all in white--a dress that was like snow on the mountain-tops when the sun is setting and gives it rose and purple colour.
