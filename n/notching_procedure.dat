40|$|Fracture {{toughness}} measurements {{with the}} use of saw cut notches or indentation flaws often give overestimated KIc when the flaws are introduced into sintered bodies which contain a meta-stable phase. Notching before sintering offers a way to eliminate the problem of residual stresses generated by flaw preparation, as it is demonstrated with partially Y 2 O 3 -stabilized tetragonal zirconias. However, the response of each new material to the <b>notching</b> <b>procedure</b> in the unsintered stage has to be considered carefully to exclude possible effects of locally changed densification and grain growth kinetics. Untransformable Al 2 O 3 microstructures show (i) similar KIc determined by ISB and by SENB with 0. 1 mm narrow notches introduced in the green state, (ii) similar KIc measured with notches of the same widths when introduced before and after sintering, respectivly. Notches introduced before sintering generate the well known, rather strong notch width influence on KIc in the notch width range betwee n 0. 1 and 0. 2 mm...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the <b>notching</b> <b>procedure</b> on the fracture toughness measured via Elastic- Plastic Fracture Mechanics has been analyzed on four different ethylene-propylene block copolymers with two distinct dimensions, paying {{special attention to the}} morphology of the area surrounding the crack tip front. Two sharpening techniques were evaluated: the traditional steel razor blade and the femtolaser ablation process. The fracture toughness of the razor blade sharpened samples was always higher than that of the femtolaser sharpened specimens. Also, the fracture toughness of the razor blade samples was dependent on the thickness of the samples, whereas the fracture toughness of the femtolaser sharpened specimens was not influenced by the dimensions of the test specimens. The microscopic analysis of non-tested samples showed that the crack tip radii were similar for both type of sharpened samples but the damage and its extension ahead of the crack tip was dependent on the notching technique, the copolymer type and the dimensions of the analyzed specimen. The femtolaser sharpened samples presented a very tinyheat affected zone ahead of the crack tip, the size of which was independent of the copolymer type and the dimensions of the test specimen. On the other hand, the steel razor blade sharpened samples showed an area surrounding the crack tip formed by plastic deformation, the length of which increased for the smaller size of sample and for higher ethylene content in the copolymer.

5000|$|This lock is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} least secure types of combination lock; many locks of this type can be quickly opened without knowledge of the correct combination. Opening one in this fashion depends on slight irregularities in the machining of the parts. Unless the lock is machined precisely, when the pin is pulled outward, one of the teeth will pull more strongly than the others on its corresponding disc. This disc is then rotated until a slight click is heard, indicating that the tooth has settled into the <b>notch.</b> The <b>procedure</b> is repeated for the remaining discs, resulting in an open lock, and a correct combination, in very little time.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to pain, mice may vocalize at frequencies above {{the range of}} human hearing (greater than 20 kHz). To determine whether an ultrasonic recording system is a reliable tool for assessing acute pain, we measured audible and ultrasonic vocalization in mice subjected to either nonpainful or potentially painful procedures performed routinely in animal facilities. Data were collected from 109 weanling mice (Mus musculus; B 6, 129 S 6 -Stab 5 b) scheduled for 2 potentially painful procedures: DNA testing by tail snip and identification by ear notching. The mice each were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 groups: 1) actual tail snip, 2) sham tail snip, 3) actual ear notch, or 4) sham ear notch. Vocalizations during the treatments were recorded with an ultrasonic recorder. Most mice (65 %; n = 55) demonstrated no vocal {{response to}} the potentially painful procedures. More mice that received actual tail snips produced audible sounds (11 of 29 mice) than did those that underwent sham tail snips (0 of 30 mice). In addition, audible vocalizations occurred more frequently during ear <b>notch</b> <b>procedures</b> (8 of 26 mice) than during sham ear-notch manipulations (2 of 24 mice). For all 20 of the mice that produced ultrasonic vocalizations, these calls were accompanied by simultaneous audible components. We conclude that ultrasonic vocalizations do not provide any more information than do audible vocalizations for assessing responses to potentially painful procedures. In addition, because many mice made no sound at all after a potentially painful stimulus, vocalizations generally are not good metrics of acute pain in laboratory mice. Alternatively, the lack of vocalizations {{in many of the}} mice may suggest that tail snipping and ear notching are not particularly painful procedures for most of these mice...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>notch</b> {{sharpening}} <b>procedure</b> on the fracture toughness computed under linear-elastic and elastic-plastic conditions (at low and high loading rates, respectively) of a bulk ethylene–propylene block copolymer has been investigated. The specimens utilized for fracture characterization were sharpened using a steel razor blade and the femtosecond laser ablation technique. The crack growth initiation parameter, JIC, determined {{with the help of}} the elastic-plastic fracture approach, and the fracture toughness, KIC, obtained with specimens verifying linear-elastic fracture mechanics assumptions, of the steel razor blade sharpened samples were higher than that of the femtolaser sharpened specimens. The plastic deformation occurring ahead of the crack tip during the sharpening method seems to be the reason for the dissimilarity of the fracture values. Moreover, the strain hardening suffered by the material close to the notch tip reduces the stable crack growth resistance evaluated under elastic-plastic conditions.

40|$|We {{report on}} two cases that {{illustrate}} an important caveat {{in the measurement}} of fractional flow reserve (FFR) in coronary arteries. To obtain accurate FFR measurements, two fundamental requirements must be fulfilled. One is to minimize microvascular resistance; {{the other is that}} there is no damping of the proximal aortic pressure trace. A problem with either of these requirements can be a source of serious error in the measurement of FFR. In each case we present here, despite a good aortic pressure trace at the start of the procedure, there is dynamic damping of the pressure trace during hyperemia, secondary to axial migration of the guiding catheter into the left main stem (LMS). In both cases, a normal aortic pressure trace (Pa) is present at baseline. After intracoronary adenosine injection, there was a fall in both mean Pa and distal coronary pressure (Pd) concomitant with damping of Pa, evidenced by loss of the dicrotic notch and ventricularization of the pressure trace. The resultant FFR value is underestimated. As hyperemia wears off, both pressure traces return to normal with good articulation of the dicrotic <b>notch.</b> When the <b>procedure</b> was repeated taking care to ensure that the guide did not move into the LMS during hyperemia, the Pa trace remained stable following intracoronary adenosine, while mean Pd decreased as before. In both cases, hemodynamically significant lesions were demonstrated that had been masked by the artifactual drop in Pa during the first attemp...|$|R
40|$|Infection due to bovine viral {{diarrhoea}} virus (BVDV) is endemic in most cattle-producing countries {{throughout the}} world. The key elements of a BVDV control programme are biosecurity, elimination of persistently infected animals and surveillance. Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) is a notifiable disease in Belgium and an official eradication programme started from January 2015, based on testing ear notches sampled during the official identification and registration of calves at birth. An antigen-capture ELISA test based on the detection of BVDV Erns protein is used. Ear notch sample may {{also be used to}} characterize the genotype of the calf when appropriate elution/dilution buffer is added. Both BVDV antigen-ELISA analysis and animal traceability could be performed. With regards to the reference protocol used in the preparation of ear <b>notch</b> samples, alternative <b>procedures</b> were tested in terms of BVDV analytic sensitivity, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, as well as quality and purity of animal DNA. The Allflex DNA Buffer D showed promising results in BVDV diagnosis and genome analyses, opening new perspectives for the livestock industry by the exploitation of the animal genome. Due to the high number of cattle involved in the Belgian official BVDV eradication programme based on ear notch tags sample, a large database on both BVDV status of newborn calves and cattle genome could be created for subsequent different uses (e. g. traceability, determination of parentage, genetic signatures throughout the genome associated with particular traits) evolving through a more integrated animal health...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} stress singularities {{at the tip of}} sharp V-notches by means of a non-local implicit gradient approach. A non-local equivalent stress is defined as a weighted average of a local stress scalar quantity computed on the assumption of linear elastic material behaviour. In the case of a crack, we propose an analytical solution for the non-local equivalent stress at the crack tip when the local equivalent stress assumes the analytical form proposed by Irwin. For open <b>notches,</b> several numerical <b>procedures</b> are possible. For welded joints, we assume that the material obeys a linear elastic constitutive law. In this case, the non-local equivalent stress obtained from the implicit gradient approach is assumed as the effective stress for assessments of joint fatigue. Using the principal stress as local equivalent stress and a notch tip or weld toe radius equal to zero, we analyse many series of are welded joints made of steel and subjected to either tensile or bending loading, and we propose a unifying fatigue scatter band. If the welded joints are subjected only to mode I loading, an analytical relationship between the relevant Notch Stress Intensity Factors (NSIF) of mode I and the effective stress is established; otherwise, the effective stress is evaluated by means of a simplified numerical analysis. For complex welded structures, however, a completely numerical solution is proposed; when different crack initiation sites are present (i. e. either weld toes or roots), the proposed approach correctly estimates the actual critical point...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPurposeOur aim was {{to assess}} the {{clinical}} and radiological outcomes of reverse shoulder replacements performed in association with a latissimus dorsi and teres major tendon transfer in cases of irreparable posterosuperior cuff tears including the teres minor tendon. Our hypothesis was that the tendon transfers would improve the clinical results of arthroplasty by restoring active external rotation. MethodsFifteen procedures in 14 patients were performed through a single deltopectoral approach. Both tendons were fixed to the proximal anterolateral aspect of the humeral metaphysis. Mean age at the time of surgery was 67. 5 years (range 53 to 82 years). All had severe cuff tear arthropathy (Hamada stage 3 or 4) and severe atrophy or fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus and teres minor on preoperative MRI or CT-scan (Goutallier stage 3 or 4). Preoperative and postoperative functions were assessed by Constant score. Satisfaction was assessed by the Simple Shoulder Test (SST). At follow up, radiographs were examined for radiolucent lines, osteolysis and scapular notching. ResultsThe average follow-up after surgery was 33. 2 months (range 24 to 60 months). The mean absolute Constant score improved significantly (P= 10 - 5) from 23. 7 ± 11. 5 preoperatively to 61. 1 ± 11. 9 postoperatively. Forward flexion and external rotation with the arm at the side improved significantly, respectively from 64. 7 ± 35. 6 ° preoperatively to 126 ± 34. 4 ° postoperatively (P< 10 - 5) and from − 8. 7 ± 21. 3 ° to 27. 3 ± 12. 2 ° (P< 0. 0005). Internal rotation was not affected. The mean SST improved from 1. 9 ± 1. 6 points preoperatively to 7. 6 ± 1. 8 points postoperatively (P< 0. 0005). Twelve patients were very satisfied or satisfied (including one with a bilateral procedure) and 2 were unsatisfied with the final result. At final follow-up, radiographs showed no radiolucent lines around the implants nor scapular <b>notching.</b> ConclusionThe combined <b>procedure</b> helped restoration of active elevation and external rotation in cases of massive cuff tear including the teres minor tendon.
