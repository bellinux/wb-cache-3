5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>know</b> his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E

In it, he stated {{that he had been}} working with guitarist Jim Matheos on a third OSI album [...] "for several months now, slowly but surely." [...] Moore later stated that with OSI, he and Matheos [...] "usually play it by ear. We <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>know</b> if we're going to do another OSI, we never agree on it. I don't remember ever agreeing to start a new one, really. But Jim will send me an idea or something and we just start talking about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Forty-five drivers {{attempted}} to qualify; due to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Keselowski clinched his first pole {{position in the}} Sprint Cup Series, {{with a time of}} 28.515. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Bowyer. Stewart qualified third, Jamie McMurray took fourth, and Juan Pablo Montoya started fifth. Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twenty-fifth, while Harvick was scored in twenty-seventh. The two drivers who failed to qualify for the race were Jeff Green and Johnny Sauter. Once qualifying concluded Keselowski said, [...] "I felt I got a shot at the pole before I qualified but you <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>know.</b> When I ran the lap I knew I gave up {{a little bit of time}} right in the middle of both corners but I had a plan going into it and stuck to it and it worked. I’m really proud of that lap." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{increased}} {{presence of}} humans {{in the water}} proved {{a factor in the}} attacks: [...] "As the worldwide human population continues to rise year after year, so does... interest in aquatic recreation. The number of shark attacks in any given year or region is highly influenced by the number of people entering the water." [...] However, the likelihood that one shark was involved is contested. Scientists such as Victor M. Coppleson and Jean Butler, relying on evidence presented by Lucas and Murphy in 1916, assert that a single shark was responsible. On the other hand, Richard Fernicola notes that 1916 was a [...] "shark year" [...] as fishermen and captains were reporting hundreds of sharks swimming in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Ellis remarks that [...] "to try to make the facts as we know them conform to the 'rogue shark' theory is stretching sensationalism and credibility beyond reasonable limits." [...] He admits, [...] "The evidence is long gone, and we will <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>know</b> if it was one shark or several, one species or another, that was responsible." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>know</b> exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like or what it can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Obsessed was thought up by Clint Culpepper, {{president}} of Screen Gems, and was shared with David Loughery, {{who wrote the}} screenplay. Producer William Packer read the script and signed on; executive producers for the film were Glenn S. Gainor, Jeff Graup, Earvin [...] "Magic" [...] Johnson, Beyoncé, Mathew Knowles, Damon Lee and Loughery, while Nicholas Stern and George Flynn served as co-producer and associate producer, respectively. Director Steve Shill signed on after reading the script and hearing that Beyoncé was on board. Part of the reason Elba joined in was that the black–white theme was ignored; [...] "It's {{not mentioned in the}} film, it's never an issue, and I think that's phenomenal ... To me, that was very refreshing that the studio execs didn't want to make an issue of it." [...] Obsessed was allocated a production budget of $20 million. Shill stated that the intended effect of the film was to have the audience discuss the characters' motivations. Writer David Loughery designed Lisa as [...] "not a villain in a traditional sense; she's not setting out to wreck a marriage or ruin somebody's life. She really believes that [...] is in love with her." [...] Lisa's past was deliberately omitted from the film, explaining, [...] "It's scarier if we <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>know</b> how she's developed this personality that can go from very loving to ultimately deadly." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, {{the group}} issued their second album In Case We Die {{on their own}} Tailem Bend label. It {{featured}} guest appearances by local musicians and was produced by The Carbohydrates (James Cecil and Cameron Bird's production duo) in Cecil's Super Melody World studio, now {{set up in a}} large garage space in Melbourne's inner northern suburbs. It was mixed by Tony Espie (The Avalanches, New Buffalo, Robert Palmer), at 001 Studios in Melbourne. Cyclic Defrosts Vaughan Healey described a typical gig as [...] "a bewildering ride through dynamic tempo changes, finger clicks and swapped instruments. You <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>know</b> who is going to sing or what will happen next, and somehow the eight-piece juggles this anarchic structure with a music class worth of instruments and staging rearrangements." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with CNN, band member Don Henley declared, [...] "This {{is probably the}} last Eagles album that we'll ever make." [...] When questioned {{about the possibility of}} a follow-up album in November 2010, band member Timothy B. Schmit said, [...] "My first reaction would be: no way. But I said that before the last one, so you <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>know.</b> Bands are a fragile entity and you never know what's going to happen. It took a long time to do that last album, over a span of years, really, and it took a lot out of us. We took a year off at one point. I'm not sure if we're able to do that again. I wouldn't close the door on it, but I don't know." [...] In a 2010 {{interview with}} undercover.fm, Joe Walsh said that the band might be able to make one more album before the band [...] "wraps it up".|$|E
2500|$|Asked in November 2010 {{whether the}} Eagles were {{planning}} {{a follow-up to}} Long Road Out of Eden, Schmit replied, [...] "My first reaction would be: no way.

[...] Frey later stated in a 2012 interview that the band has had discussions about releasing an EP of potentially 4–6 songs that may contain both original and cover material.|$|E

2500|$|Richter {{explained}} {{his approach to}} performance as follows: [...] "The interpreter is really an executant, carrying out the composer's intentions to the letter. [...] He doesn't add anything that isn't already in the work. [...] If he is talented, he allows us to glimpse {{the truth of the}} work that is in itself a thing of genius and that is reflected in him. [...] He shouldn't dominate the music, but should dissolve into it." [...] Or, similarly: [...] "I am not a complete idiot, but whether from weakness or laziness have no talent for thinking. I know only how to reflect: I am a mirror [...] [...] [...] Logic does not exist for me. I float on the waves of art and life and <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>know</b> how to distinguish what belongs to the one or the other or what is common to both. Life unfolds for me like a theatre presenting a sequence of somewhat unreal sentiments; while the things of art are real to me and go straight to my heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, {{frontman}} Josh Homme {{was hospitalized}} for thirteen days, and subsequently bedridden for four months, following complications during a routine surgical procedure on his knee. Homme noted, [...] "I {{woke up and}} there was a doctor going, ‘Shit, we lost you.' I couldn’t get up for four months. When I did, I hadn’t got a clue what was going on." [...] During this time, Homme sank into a deep depression, noting [...] "I would never say, 'I'm probably not gonna make it out of here.' But back then, I would definitely think it." [...] The remaining members of Queens of the Stone Age— guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, drummer Joey Castillo, bassist Michael Shuman and guitarist and keyboardist Dean Fertita – encouraged Homme to return to the band to begin work on a sixth studio album. Homme noted, [...] "I had to ask them 'If {{you want to make a}} record with me right now, in the state I’m in, come into the fog. It's the only chance you got.' It brought us much closer, because you <b>never</b> <b>really</b> <b>know</b> someone till everything goes wrong." ...|$|E
