5|$|Though {{it might}} seem as if the Bible {{translation}} set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during {{the remainder of the}} century. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. The spelling debate raged on until the early 19th century, and it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> {{the latter half of the}} 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards.|$|E
5|$|Although {{advertising}} revenue increased post-aggregation, local programming declined {{as a result}} of the costs incurred by the network's expansion – an estimated $45 million had been spent by Ramcorp during and in the lead-up to aggregation.

5|$|Although {{europium}} {{is present}} {{in most of the}} minerals containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> the late 1800s that the element was isolated.

5|$|Although serious {{efforts were}} made to oppose Jim Crow laws in Nashville as early as 1905, it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> 1958, with the {{formation}} of the Nashville Christian Leadership Council, that Nashville's African American community would lay the foundation for dismantling racial segregation.|$|E
5|$|As the {{relations}} between the West and the Soviet Union deteriorated with the US and the UK backing Turkey, Soviet claims were out of the agenda by 1947.

5|$|Because Exmoor was a royal forest, i.e. {{a hunting}} reserve, it was {{unpopulated}} in Medieval times. The first {{house on the}} moor was only built at Simonsbath in 1654. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> the 19th century that farms were built around the moor.|$|E

5|$|Each {{subsequent}} {{line was}} built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway line into Preston used its own station.
