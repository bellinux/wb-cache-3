40|$|We studied whether pharmacists {{involved}} in dis-charge planning can improve patient satisfaction and outcomes by providing telephone follow-up after hospital discharge. We conducted a randomized trial at the General Medical Service {{of an academic}} teaching hospital. We enrolled General Medical Ser-vice patients who received pharmacy-facilitated dis-charge from the hospital to home. The intervention consisted of a follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> by a pharmacist 2 days after discharge. During <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call,</b> phar-macists asked patients about their medications, in-cluding whether they obtained and understood how to take them. Two weeks after discharge, we mailed all patients a questionnaire to assess satisfaction with hospitalization and reviewed hospital records. Of the 1, 958 patients discharged from the General Medical Service from August 1, 1998 to March 31, 1999, 221 patients consented to participate. We ran-domized 110 to <b>the</b> intervention group (<b>phone</b> <b>call)</b> and 111 to the control group (no <b>phone</b> <b>call).</b> Patients returned 145 (66 %) surveys. More patients in <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> than <b>the</b> no <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> group were satis-fied with discharge medication instructions (86 % vs. 61 %, P 0. 007). <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> allowed pharmacists to identify and resolve medication-related problems for 15 patients (19 %). Twelve patients (15 %) con-tacted by telephone reported new medical problems requiring referral to their inpatient team. Fewer pa-tients from <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> group returned to the emergency department within 30 days (10 % <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> vs. 24 % no <b>phone</b> <b>call,</b> P 0. 005). A follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> by a pharmacist {{involved in}} the hospital care of patients was associated with increased pa-tient satisfaction, resolution of medication-related problems, and fewer return visits to the emergenc...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Little {{is known}} about the {{long-term}} effects of interventions aimed at increasing turnout among voluntary blood donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We use a retrospective natural experiment with all 40, 653 donors who were repeatedly invited to blood drives in Zurich, Switzerland, between 2010 and 2013. The intervention is a quasi-randomized <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> informing donors of a current shortage of their blood type. The panel structure of the data allows identification of different types of donors reacting to <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call.</b> RESULTS Our analysis reveals two types. Type 1 donors make up 27. 1 % of the population. They are highly motivated and exhibit a baseline donation rate of 59. 4 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> raises their probability to donate by 9. 9 % at the upcoming blood drive (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). However, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> reduces their donation rate by 2. 3 % (p[*]=[*] 0. 003) at each future blood drive. In contrast, the 72. 9 % of Type 2 donors exhibit a low baseline donation rate of 5. 8 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> raises their probability to donate by 5. 8 % at the upcoming blood drive (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> leads to habit formation in Type 2 donors and increases their donation rate by 2. 1 % at the next blood drive (p[*]=[*] 0. 03). CONCLUSION Behavioral interventions are effective at increasing donation rates in the short run. However, they can crowd out the intrinsic motivation of the most motivated donors. Thus, blood donation services should avoid interventions for highly motivated donors and target them at irregular donors. Our results also sound a warning on using other interventions...|$|R
