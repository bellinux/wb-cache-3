50|$|A {{computer}} with true n-bit addressing may have 2 <b>addressable</b> <b>units</b> of RAM installed. An {{example is a}} 32-bit x86 processor with 4 GB and without Physical Address Extension (PAE). In this case, the processor is able to address all the RAM installed and no more.|$|R
50|$|With the 1410 series, the {{smallest}} <b>addressable</b> <b>unit</b> in core-storage is called character.The 1410 stores alphameric characters internally in binary-coded decimal (BCD) form, spanning 6 bits called BA8421. When {{the character is}} an operation code or is the first character in a field, another bit, called word mark, is included. An odd parity bit, called C, is also included.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{with the}} {{smallest}} <b>addressable</b> <b>unit,</b> the DataModules under the use of different Document Type Definitions (DTD's) or schemas has to be supported. Furthermore, the publications, in process review forms (IPRF's) in later S1000D versions known as comments, for authoring reasons must be provided. Last but not least the illustrations {{and all kinds of}} hotspot declaration files have to be assisted.|$|R
50|$|The term byte {{initially}} meant 'the smallest <b>addressable</b> <b>unit</b> of memory'. In the past, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 9-bit bytes {{have all}} been used. There have also been computers that could address individual bits ('bit-addressed machine'), or that could only address 16- or 32-bit quantities ('word-addressed machine'). The term byte was usually not used at all in connection with bit- and word-addressed machines.|$|R
50|$|The {{digital line}} card is {{equipped}} with 16 identical digital line interfaces. Each interface provides a multiplexed voice, data, and signaling path to and from a digital terminal (telephone) over a 2-wire full duplex 512 kHz Time Division Multiplex (TDM) digital link. Each digital telephone and associated data terminal is assigned a separate Terminal Number (TN) in the system database, giving a total of 32 <b>addressable</b> <b>units</b> per card.|$|R
50|$|This {{means that}} unaligned PER data is {{essentially}} an ordered stream of bits, and not an ordered stream of bytes like with aligned PER, {{and that it will}} be a bit more complex to decode by software on usual processors because it will require additional contextual bit-shifting and masking and not direct byte addressing (but the same remark would be true with modern processors and memory/storage <b>units</b> whose minimum <b>addressable</b> <b>unit</b> is larger than 1 octet). However modern processors and signal processors include hardware support for fast internal decoding of bit streams with automatic handling of computing units that are crossing the boundaries of <b>addressable</b> storage <b>units</b> (this is needed for efficient processing in data codecs for compression/decompression or with some encryption/decryption algorithms).|$|R
50|$|Compression {{algorithms}} often code in bitstreams, as the 8 bits {{offered by}} a byte (the smallest <b>addressable</b> <b>unit</b> of memory) may be wasteful. Although typically implemented in low-level languages, some high-level languages such as Python and Java offer native interfaces for bitstream I/O. Such reduced-depth bitstreams may also be accessed by reading several bytes at a time, which may simplify access in some languages (for example, four 6-bit integers {{can be stored in}} three whole 8-bit bytes).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>addressable</b> <b>unit</b> {{of memory}} on the NCR 315 series is a [...] "slab", short for [...] "syllable", {{consisting}} of 12 data bits and a parity bit. Its size falls between a byte and a typical word (hence the name, 'syllable'). A slab may contain three digits (with at sign, comma, space, ampersand, point, and minus treated as digits) or two alphabetic characters of six bits each. A slab may contain a decimal value from -99 to +999.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In most cases, current Internet {{architecture}} treats {{content and}} services simply as bits of data transported between end-systems. While this relatively simple model of operation had clear benefits when users interacted with well-known servers, the recent {{evolution of the}} way the Internet is used makes it necessary to create a new model of interaction between entities representing content. In this paper we study the limitations of current Internet and propose a new model, where the smallest <b>addressable</b> <b>unit</b> is a content object, regardless of its location...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Web {{services}} are small applications {{that can be}} separately deploy and invoked by further software or services on the web. Service is a <b>network</b> <b>addressable</b> software component to perform a specific task. A service discovery mechanism {{can be used to}} find services that can be executed and satisfy a service request. In many cases, a single service is not sufficient to fulfill the user's request and services should be combined together. By using service composition that’s possible.

50|$|The PEEK {{function}} and POKE command are usually invoked as follows, either in direct mode (entered and executed at the BASIC prompt) or in indirect mode (as {{part of a}} program):integer_variable = PEEK(address)POKE address, valueThe address and value parameters may contain complex expressions, {{as long as the}} evaluated expressions correspond to valid memory addresses or values, respectively. A valid address in this context is an address within the computer's address space, while a valid value is (typically) an unsigned value between zero and the maximum unsigned number that the minimum <b>addressable</b> <b>unit</b> (memory cell) may hold.|$|R
5000|$|The {{smallest}} <b>addressable</b> <b>unit</b> {{of memory}} was a 16-bit word (unlike the later PDP-11, which was addressable by byte), and the maximum possible address was 32,767, which would {{fit in a}} word with one bit left over. The most significant bit of any memory-reference instruction indicated indirect addressing: The word addressed by the instruction, instead of being the operand, contained the operand address. The most significant bit of that word could be set to indicate an additional level of indirect addressing, and this could be iterated any number of times, potentially in an infinite loop {{that could not be}} interrupted.|$|R
5000|$|A {{character}} type (typically called [...] "char") {{may contain}} a single letter, digit, punctuation mark, symbol, formatting code, control code, {{or some other}} specialized code (e.g., a byte order mark). In C, [...] {{is defined as the}} smallest <b>addressable</b> <b>unit</b> of memory. On most systems, this is 8 bits; Several standards, such as POSIX, require it to be this size. Some languages have two or more character types, for example a single-byte type for ASCII characters and a multi-byte type for Unicode characters. The term [...] "character type" [...] is normally used even for types whose values more precisely represent code units, for example a UTF-16 code unit as in Java and JavaScript.|$|R
5000|$|All data in {{computers}} based on digital electronics is represented as bits (alternatives 0 and 1) {{on the lowest}} level. The smallest <b>addressable</b> <b>unit</b> of data is usually a group of bits called a byte (usually an octet, which is 8 bits). The unit processed by machine code instructions is called a word (as of 2011, typically 32 or 64 bits). Most instructions interpret the word as a binary number, such that a 32-bit word can represent unsigned integer values from 0 to [...] or signed integer values from [...] to [...] Because of two's complement, the machine language and machine doesn't need to distinguish between these unsigned and signed data types for the most part.|$|R
5000|$|RT-11 {{implemented}} {{a simple and}} fast file system employing six-character filenames with three-character extensions ("6.3") encoded in RADIX-50, which packed those nine characters into only three 16-bit words (six bytes). All files were contiguous, meaning that each file occupied consecutive blocks (the minimally <b>addressable</b> <b>unit</b> of disk storage, 512 bytes) on the disk. This meant that an entire file could be read (or written) very quickly. A side effect of this file system structure was that, as files were created and deleted on a volume over time, the unused disk blocks would likely not remain contiguous, which could become the limiting factor {{in the creation of}} large files; the remedy was to periodically “squeeze” (or [...] "squish") a disk to consolidate the unused portions.|$|R

The system oers multithreaded processing and an object-oriented application programming interface. It also provides facilities for using many memory consistency models {{at the same}} time. Due to implementation in Java language, Jash is fully hardware independent and therefore it constitutes a very promising platform for developing parallel programs in heterogeneous environments.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{computer architecture}} and operating system developments {{to determine a}} set of requirements applicable to all computer systems. The requirements obtained by this examination are used to define {{the concept of a}} nucleus for a computer system. A nucleus structure, based around an addressing scheme and a set of functions, is presented. This structure does not include processor and peripheral designs, but concentrates on the interaction between these components. The proposed addressing scheme is based on capability addressing, with the structure recognizing processors, peripherals, processes and files as <b>addressable</b> <b>units.</b> The functions proposed assist in scheduling of processes for processors and peripherals. These functions are also referenced through the addressing scheme which assists in the creation of virtual machine environments. Implementation techniques for the proposed nucleus are also examined in the context of validating the nucleus proposal. These implementation techniques are also discussed as final implementation methods...|$|R

5000|$|The byte (...) is a unit {{of digital}} {{information}} that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte {{was the number of}} bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest <b>addressable</b> <b>unit</b> of memory in many computer architectures.The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size - byte-sizes from 1 to 48 bits are known to have been used in the past. The modern de-facto standard of eight bits, as documented in ISO/IEC 2382-1:1993, is a convenient power of two permitting the values 0 through 255 for one byte. The international standard IEC 80000-13 codified this common meaning. Many types of applications use information representable in eight or fewer bits and processor designers optimize for this common usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures has aided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the eight-bit size.|$|R

These components include promoters, transcription start (TSSs) and termination sites (TTSs), open reading frames (ORFs), regulatory non-coding regions (RNCRs), untranslated regions (UTRs) and transcription units (TUs), that together comprise the meta-structure of a genome. The meta-structure of the Escherichia coli K- 12 MG 1655 genome is described here and it was obtained by iterative integration of multiple genome-scale measurements. The meta-structure is comprised of 3, 139 independently <b>addressable</b> modular <b>units</b> amounting to an experimental annotation of the genome.

40|$|In this thesis, I present two novel {{microfluidic}} {{techniques for}} cell-based high throughput analysis: flow-through electroporation and micro-bioreactor arrays. This thesis falls into two main parts. Part I (chapter 2 to 7) demonstrates the electroporative technique and part II (chapter 8 to 9) presents the micro-bioreactor array with individually <b>addressable</b> <b>unit.</b> ^ The flow-through electroporation {{is achieved by}} narrowing specific section(s) of microchannels. The narrow section(s) is able to amplify the electric field intensity due to its high resistance. Both transient and permanent electroporations are successfully conducted using this technique. The transient electroporation is witnessed by the cell size expansion and delivery of membrane impermeant molecules into CHO-K 1 cells. The fast release of pre-loaded fluorogenic dye from CHO-K 1 cells indicates the permanent disrupture of cell membrane under extreme electroporation conditions. A proof-of-concept device for chemical cytometry is also demonstrated using the flow-through electroporation. The effects of electric parameters and buffer concentrations to the electroporation are investigated in detail and optimization of the electroporation is also addressed. The flow-through electroporation can as well be applied to pasteurization when resulting field intensity in the narrow section(s) is larger than 1 KV/cm. ^ The micro-bioreactor array {{is built based on}} multi-layer soft lithography. The array was designed to provide refined sample maneuver and enclosed microenvironment. Microvalves around each cell culture unit are in charge of the traffics of solutions in the device. Controllable cell seeding (with different amounts and types) and independent treatments of cells in different unit are achieved through actuating microvalves. This micro-bioreactor array overcomes some of the major problems encountered in analysis of multiple samples on the microfluidic platforms. ...|$|R

40|$|Distributed systems {{require the}} ability to {{communicate}} securely with other computers in the network. To accomplish this, most systems use key management schemes that require prior knowledge of public keys associated with critical nodes. In large, dynamic, anonymous systems, this key sharing method is not viable. Scribe is a method for efficient key management inside a distributed system that uses identity based encryption (IBE). Public resources in a <b>network</b> are <b>addressable</b> by unique identifiers. Using this identifier as a public key, other entities are able to securely access that resource. We evaluate key distribution schemes inside Scribe and provide recommendations for practical implementation to allow for secure, efficient, authenticated communication inside a distributed system. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Secure Content <b>Addressable</b> <b>Network</b> (SCAN) is an {{architecture}} for service discovery in service centric sensor networks that enables dynamic service composition. This paper proposes two new security mechanisms for SCAN: Single Path Key Exchange (SPX) and Multi Path Key Exchange (MPX). Both security mechanisms allow two arbitrary nodes of SCAN to exchange a symmetric key for secure communication. We also propose to use replication service information and majority vote to achieve security. We evaluated {{the performance and}} security of Secure Content <b>Addressable</b> <b>Networks</b> with Single Path Key Exchange, Multi Path Key Exchange and replication using a worst case attack model. It has been found, that in a network with 1000 nodes and 5 % malicious nodes {{the probability of a}} successful lookup operation is still 80 %. The results of the simulation indicate, that the overhead and the security level of SCAN with SPX and MPX scale with an increasing number of nodes. The simulation results also show that SCAN is suitable for networks with 100 to 1000 nodes. ...|$|R
50|$|A digital computer's memory, more {{specifically}} main memory, consists of many memory locations, each having a physical address, a code, which the CPU (or other device) {{can use to}} access it. Generally only system software, i.e. the BIOS, operating systems, and some specialized utility programs (e.g., memory testers), address physical memory using machine code operands or processor registers, instructing the CPU to direct a hardware device, called the memory controller, to use the memory bus or system bus, or separate control, address and data busses, to execute the program's commands. The memory controllers' bus consists {{of a number of}} parallel lines, each represented by a binary digit (bit).
