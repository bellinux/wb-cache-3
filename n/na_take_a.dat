The heretics are soon reinforced by Galactic Alliance soldiers who managed to get past the Yuuzhan Vongs space defenses as the space fleets of both the Alliance and the Vong duel over the contested planetary capital of the galaxy and the world of Muscave. Meanwhile, <b>Nas</b> Choka <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> portion of his fleet to destroy Zonama Sekot using the Alpha Red-infected Slayer ship, as Shimrra revealed previously that there is indeed a biological connection between the Vong and Zonama.

On Yuuzhantar, Luke Skywalker, his wife Mara, Jaina and Jacen Solo, Tahiri Veila, and Kenth Hamner all join up with Captain Judder Pages commandos in order to storm Shimrras Citadel and kill the Supreme Overlord, ending the Yuuzhan Vong War once and for all.

After Mara gives him a severe beating, Nom Anor pleads for his life, which Mara grudgingly spares so that he would be properly convicted for his crimes in the end.|$|R
