5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> lips, as {{there would have been}} no room for such soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E

5|$|During the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), {{emperors}} chose their consorts {{primarily from}} one of the eight Banner families, administrative divisions that divide all native Manchu families. To maintain the ethnic purity of the ruling dynasty, after the Kangxi Period (1662–1722), emperors and princes were forbidden to marry non-Manchu wives. Imperial daughters however were <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> this ban, and as with their preceding dynasties, were often married to Mongol princes to gain political or military support, especially {{in the early years of}} the Qing dynasty; three of the nine daughters of Emperor Nurhaci and twelve of Emperor Hongtaiji's daughters were married to Mongol Princes.|$|E
5|$|Many {{efforts have}} also been made to promote guinea pig {{husbandry}} in developing countries of West Africa, where they occur more widely than generally known because they are usually <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> livestock statistics. However, {{it has not been}} known when and where the animals have been introduced to Africa. In Cameroon, they are widely distributed. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they can be found both in peri-urban environments as well as in rural regions, for example, in South Kivu. They are also frequently held in rural households in Iringa Region of southwestern Tanzania.|$|E

5|$|A sponge's body is {{hollow and}} {{is held in}} shape by the mesohyl, a jelly-like {{substance}} made mainly of collagen and reinforced by a dense network of fibers also made of collagen. The inner surface is covered with choanocytes, cells with cylindrical or conical collars surrounding one flagellum per choanocyte. The wave-like motion of the whip-like flagella drives water through the sponge's body. All sponges have ostia, channels leading to the interior through the mesohyl, and in most sponges these are controlled by tube-like porocytes that form closable inlet valves. Pinacocytes, plate-like cells, form a single-layered external skin over all {{other parts of the}} mesohyl that are <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> choanocytes, and the pinacocytes also digest food particles that are too large to enter the ostia, while those {{at the base of the}} animal are responsible for anchoring it.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{the police were}} {{managing}} the Sitting Bull incident. In 1876 the United States military led a campaign against the Sioux in Dakota; the Sioux's leader, Sitting Bull, concluded that the conflict was unwinnable, and chose to seek sanctuary in Canada. Sitting Bull arrived in May the following year and, by the summer, around 5,600 Sioux had crossed the border despite opposition from the Blackfoot. The mounted police helped to facilitate the negotiations with the Sioux, in which Assistant Commissioner Acheson Irvine played a prominent part. The Sioux declined to return south, however, and the police had to deploy around 200 men to Fort Walsh to oversee the immigrant community. The police lived in primitive conditions and voluntarily shared {{some of their own}} supplies with the Sioux, who were <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> Treaty 7 and therefore ineligible for government support. Nonetheless, starvation gradually forced the return of most of the newcomers to the United States, and Sitting Bull himself finally surrendered in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Despite the treaty, Henry {{set about}} inflicting severe {{penalties}} on the barons who had stood against {{him during the}} invasion. William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, was accused of fresh crimes, which were <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> the Alton amnesty, and was banished from England. In 1102 Henry then turned against Robert of Bellême and his brothers, {{the most powerful of}} the barons, accusing him of 45 different offences. Robert escaped and took up arms against Henry. Henry besieged Robert's castles at Arundel, Tickhill and Shrewsbury, pushing down into the south-west to attack Bridgnorth. His power base in England broken, Robert accepted Henry's offer of banishment and left the country for Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Hours after Isabel made landfall, President George W. Bush {{issued a}} major {{disaster}} declaration for 26 North Carolina counties, which allowed {{the use of}} federal personnel, equipment and lifesaving systems and the delivery of heavy-duty generators, plastic sheeting, tents, cots, food, water, medical aid and other essential supplies and materials for sustaining human life. The declaration also allocated federal funds for the long-term recovery of hurricane-stricken residents and business owners, {{as well as providing}} federal funds for the state and local governments to pay 75 percent of the eligible cost for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane, including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government. By four days after the emergency declaration, assistance checks were mailed and used by residents to pay for what was <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> their insurance.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, BART {{became the}} first transit system in the United States to offer {{cellular}} telephone communication to passengers of all major wireless carriers on its trains underground. Service was made available for customers of Verizon Wireless, Sprint/Nextel, AT Mobility, and T-Mobile in and between the four San Francisco Market Street stations from Civic Center to Embarcadero. In 2009, service was expanded to include the Transbay Tube, thus providing continuous cellular coverage between West Oakland and Balboa Park. In 2010, service was expanded to all underground stations in Oakland (19th Street, 12th Street/Oakland City Center, and Lake Merritt). Uninterrupted cellular coverage of the entire BART system is a goal. As of 2012 passengers in both the Berkeley Hills tunnel and the Berkeley subway (Ashby, Downtown and North Berkeley) received cell service. The only section still <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> cell service is a short tunnel that leads to Walnut Creek BART, and San Mateo County subway stations (including service to SFO and Millbrae).|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} prior to the game, both teams {{had to cope with}} harsh winter weather in the Nashville area. Virginia Tech was forced to move {{practices}} indoors when an ice storm arrived on the day before Christmas. The storm caused travel delays for fans and players alike. Alabama's first practices in Nashville were held without the full team available because many players had been delayed. The harsh weather continued through the day of the game, and Tech was forced to cancel its final outdoor practice before the game. Alabama, meanwhile, drove 45 minutes to Murfreesboro to a practice field that was <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> ice.|$|E

5|$|KNI and its {{subsidiary}} Pilersuisoq, a state-owned {{chain of}} all-purpose general stores in Greenland, {{are based in}} Sisimiut. The Pilersuisoq chain operates in all small settlements in the country, as well as smaller towns which are <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> supermarket chains. A range of shops operate in Sisimiut, from chain supermarkets of Pisiffik and Brugsen to independent outlets, also serving supplies to the smaller settlements in the region. Polaroil, a liquid fuel distribution company, is headquartered in Sisimiut. It employs 70 staff and operates 70 stations in Greenland. The headquarters were moved from Maniitsoq to Sisimiut in the late 2000s. In 2010 KNI announced plans to also move the operational base of Polaroil from Maniitsoq to Sisimiut, causing protests in the former community already experiencing depopulation. Other facilities include two banks, a library, a Post Greenland office and a small hospital/health center with 19 beds.|$|E
5|$|Little {{documentary}} {{evidence of the}} games remains; contemporary and near-contemporary writings mostly record the major details and concentrate on the opening days. The poet Martial gives the most complete and only truly contemporary account {{in the form of}} his De Spectaculis ("On the Spectacles"), a somewhat sycophantic series of epigrams detailing the individual events of the games as an illustration of Titus' power and benevolence. Much of the work is concerned with praising Titus, and there have been difficulties with authenticating, dating and translating various portions, but Martial does give details of events <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> other sources and the only known surviving complete record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena.|$|E
5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was <b>not</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
