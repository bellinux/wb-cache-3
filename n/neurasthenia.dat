5|$|After the war, Wilson {{served as}} a member of the Gerow Board, which {{examined}} the military educational system and instituted a series of long-lasting reforms. In 1947, he was diagnosed with <b>neurasthenia,</b> and retired with the rank of major general.|$|E
5|$|In October 1946, Wilson was {{diagnosed}} with <b>neurasthenia.</b> Discharged {{on the grounds of}} disability with the rank of major general, he retired to Carmel, California, where he wrote and published his memoirs, entitled Wooing Peponi, in 1973. He died on 21 June 1978. His papers are in The George C. Marshall Foundation.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Riley's doctor {{diagnosed}} {{him with}} <b>neurasthenia,</b> a nervous disorder, and recommended {{long periods of}} rest as a cure. Riley remained ill {{for the rest of}} his life and relied on his landlords and family to aid in his care. During the winter months he moved to Miami, Florida, and during summer spent time with his family in Greenfield. He made only a few trips during the decade, including one to Mexico in 1906. He became very depressed by his condition, writing to his friends that he thought he could die at any moment, and often used alcohol for relief.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (<b>neurasthenia)</b> and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E
5|$|Daphnis et Chloé was {{commissioned}} in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes. Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine, and designer, Léon Bakst. Fokine {{had a reputation}} for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music. This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music. There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work. It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London. The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health; <b>neurasthenia</b> obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} a second creative drought, {{brought on by}} bouts of depression and alarming physical symptoms. Rushes of blood to the head, confusion, memory loss and unpleasant obsessions led to a medical diagnosis of <b>neurasthenia.</b> Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household {{may have been a}} factor—the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890, the deaths of his mother and youngest child, as well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child. He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently. After making third versions of the musical tableau Sadko and the opera The Maid of Pskov, he closed his musical account with the past; he had left none of his major works before May Night in their original form.|$|E
5|$|With Lenin now {{based in}} Geneva, the {{arguments}} between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks continued after the conference. The Bolsheviks accused their rivals of being opportunists and reformists who lacked any discipline, while the Mensheviks accused Lenin {{of being a}} despot and autocrat, comparing him to Maximilien de Robespierre. When Plekhanov sided with Martov, Lenin flew into a rage and resigned from both the Iskra editorial board and the Party Council. In May 1904, he published One Step Forward, Two Steps Back, a booklet claiming that Martov's supporters had tricked him into this. The stress added to an illness, {{which at the time}} was probably diagnosed as <b>neurasthenia,</b> and to relive this, he went on a climbing holiday in the countryside in June. Some party members attempted to reunite the feuding factions, but this failed, and by the spring, all eight members of the Central Committee were Bolsheviks. In December, they founded a Bolshevik newspaper, Vperëd (Forward).|$|E

25|$|Whatever his motivation, {{the fact}} that Rivers's {{interests}} lay in neurology and psychology became evident in this period. Reports and papers given by Rivers at the Abernethian Society of St. Bart's indicate a growing specialism in these fields: Delirium and its allied conditions (1889), Hysteria (1891) and <b>Neurasthenia</b> (1893).|$|E
25|$|Still in poor health, in December 1916, Johnston went to England {{for medical}} {{treatment}} and {{was diagnosed with}} <b>neurasthenia.</b> He later took command of the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade Reserve Camp, better known as Sling Camp. He returned to the Western Front in late July 1917, this time as commander of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. Visiting the front lines, he was killed on 7 August 1917 by sniper fire.|$|E
25|$|After Lin's {{injury in}} 1938, he {{suffered}} from ongoing {{physical and mental health}} problems. His exact medical condition is not well understood, partially because his medical records have never been publicly released. Dr. Li Zhisui, then one of Mao's personal physicians, believed that Lin suffered from <b>neurasthenia</b> and hypochondria. He became ill whenever he perspired, and suffered from phobias about water, wind, cold, light, and noise. He was said to become nervous at the sight of rivers and oceans in traditional Chinese paintings, and suffered from diarrhea, which could be triggered by the sound of running water. Li's account of Lin's condition is notably different from the official Chinese version.|$|E
25|$|The {{optimism}} of la belle époque was destroyed, {{and those who}} had fought in the war were referred to as the Lost Generation. For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled. Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from shell shock (also called <b>neurasthenia,</b> a condition related to posttraumatic stress disorder). Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status. Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman, Paul Fussell, and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.|$|E
500|$|Lenin {{was seriously}} ill {{by the latter}} half of 1921, {{suffering}} from hyperacusis, insomnia, and regular headaches. At the Politburo's insistence, in July he left Moscow for a month's leave at his Gorki mansion, where he was cared for by his wife and sister. [...] Lenin began to contemplate the possibility of suicide, asking both Krupskaya and Stalin to acquire potassium cyanide for him. Twenty-six physicians were hired to help Lenin during his final years; many of them were foreign and had been hired at great expense. Some suggested that his sickness could have been caused by metal oxidation from the bullets that were lodged in his body from the 1918 assassination attempt; in April 1922 he underwent a surgical operation to remove them. The symptoms continued after this, with Lenin's doctors unsure of the cause; some suggested that he was suffering from <b>neurasthenia</b> or cerebral arteriosclerosis; others believed that he had syphilis, an idea endorsed in a 2004 report by a team of neuroscientists, who suggested that this was later deliberately concealed by the government. In May 1922, he suffered his first stroke, temporarily losing his ability to speak and being paralysed on his right side. He convalesced at Gorki, and had largely recovered by July. In October he returned to Moscow; in December he suffered a second stroke and returned to Gorki.|$|E
2500|$|Opium {{addiction}} in {{the later}} 19th century received a hereditary definition. Dr. George Beard in 1869 proposed his theory of <b>neurasthenia,</b> a hereditary nervous system deficiency that could predispose an individual to addiction. <b>Neurasthenia</b> was increasingly tied in medical rhetoric to the [...] "nervous exhaustion" [...] suffered by many a white-collar worker in the increasingly hectic and industrialized U.S. life—the most likely potential clients of physicians.|$|E
2500|$|Though Kellogg {{stated that}} [...] "electricity is {{not capable of}} {{accomplishing}} half the marvels that are claimed for it by many enthusiastic electrotherapists," [...] he still believed electric currents to be [...] "an extremely valuable therapeutic agent, especially when utilized in connection with hydrotherapy, thermotherapy, and other physiologic methods." [...] As a result, electrotherapy coils {{were used in the}} Static Electrical Department of the Battle Creek Sanitarium especially for cases of paresthesias of <b>neurasthenia,</b> insomnia, and certain forms of neuralgia. Devices were also utilized to administer electric shocks to various parts of a patient's body.|$|E
2500|$|His {{state of}} unease and <b>neurasthenia</b> is {{reflected}} in his Symphony in C, numbered second, but third in order of composition, in which the composer explores states of exhaustion, obsession and depression, culminating in Beethovenian spiritual triumph. Also published in 1845 was his Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54, originally conceived and performed as a one-movement Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra in 1841. It {{is one of the}} most popular and oft-recorded of all piano concertos; according to Hutcheson [...] "Schumann achieved a masterly work and we inherited the finest piano concerto since Mozart and Beethoven".|$|E
2500|$|Eventually a close {{friendship}} {{and a strong}} professional association developed between the elder Freud and Jung, which left a sizeable correspondence. For six years they cooperated in their work. In 1912, however, Jung published Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (known in English as Psychology of the Unconscious), which made manifest the developing theoretical divergence between the two. Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured—each stating that the other was unable to admit he could possibly be wrong. After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. Henri Ellenberger called Jung's intense experience a [...] "creative illness" [...] and compared it favorably to Freud's own period of what he called <b>neurasthenia</b> and hysteria.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} a {{spell of}} convalescent leave, Sassoon {{declined}} to return to duty; instead, encouraged by pacifist friends such as Bertrand Russell and Lady Ottoline Morrell, he sent a letter to his commanding officer entitled [...] Forwarded to the press and read out in the House of Commons by a sympathetic member of Parliament, the letter was seen by some as treasonous ("I am making this statement as an act of wilful defiance of military authority") or at best as condemning the war government's motives ("I believe that the war upon which I entered as a war of defence and liberation has now become a war of aggression and conquest"). Rather than court-martial Sassoon, the Under-Secretary of State for War, Ian Macpherson, decided that he was unfit for service and had him sent to Craiglockhart War Hospital near Edinburgh, where he was officially treated for <b>neurasthenia</b> ("shell shock").|$|E
2500|$|In 1909 Debussy {{wrote that}} he had almost {{finished}} Roderick Usher's monologue: [...] "It almost makes the stones weep... {{as a matter of}} fact it is all about the influence of stones on the minds of neurasthenic people. The mustiness is charmingly rendered by contrasting the low notes of the oboe with the harmonics of the violin (a patent device of my own)." [...] Debussy had believed he had been subject to <b>neurasthenia</b> but around this time his doctor diagnosed him as suffering from the rectal cancer which was to kill him. According to Robert Orledge, [...] "Debussy began increasingly to identify with Roderick Usher, whose mental breakdown Poe had identified with the crumbling House itself." [...] Debussy made three attempts at writing a libretto. Only when he was satisfied with the third one did he produce a short-score draft of the music to the first scene and part of the second in 1916–17. He went no further with Usher before his death in 1918.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 October 1915, {{he enlisted}} in the Artists' Rifles Officers' Training Corps. For the next seven months, he trained at Hare Hall Camp in Essex. On 4 June 1916, he was {{commissioned}} as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the Manchester Regiment. Initially Owen held his troops in contempt for their loutish behaviour, and {{in a letter to}} his mother described his company as [...] "expressionless lumps". However, his imaginative existence was to be changed dramatically by a number of traumatic experiences. He fell into a shell hole and suffered concussion; he was blown up by a trench mortar and spent several days unconscious on an embankment lying amongst the remains of one of his fellow officers. Soon afterward, Owen was diagnosed as suffering from <b>neurasthenia</b> or shell shock and sent to Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh for treatment. It was while recuperating at Craiglockhart that he met fellow poet Siegfried Sassoon, an encounter that was to transform Owen's life.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Westermeyer, Head of Psychiatry at the University of Oklahoma, {{states that}} a {{culturally}} bound syndrome {{is defined as}} [...] "certain trance-like disturbances [...] occur with unusual frequencies in certain societies". These syndromes, he says, actually occur {{in a wide variety}} of cultures separated by great distance that have similar symptoms [...] including [...] "fear, anxiety, amnesia, aimless escape, psychophysiological symptoms, social withdrawal, behavioral deviance and nondirected violence". [...] However, these symptoms are not confined to culturally bound syndromes, as others, such as [...] "personality disorder, <b>neurasthenia,</b> crisis/judgment disorders, organic brain syndromes, drug-induced delirium, major depression, mania, schizophreniform and schizophrenia" [...] might constitute the true psychiatric diagnosis." [...] Because of these cross-cultural symptoms, it is argued that these syndromes are not necessarily unique [...] ". and that applying the term ‘culturally bound’ to them hampers science’s ability to explore them on the same level as other psychological problems.

2500|$|After Graduation, Danqun Fang {{began his}} {{scientific}} work at Beijing Municipal Institute of Labor Protection. In the 1960s, he successfully developed {{a series of}} mufflers {{that could be used}} in industry environment. On the basis of the sound absorption theory of Micro perforated plate proposed by Prof. Daa-You Maa, Danqun Fang successfully developed a series of micro-perforated plate mufflers, which was widely used for sound absorption. From the 1970s, Danqun Fang led a team of acousticians, physiologists and doctors to research the influence of noise on hearing, cardiovascular, nervous system. After working out series of relationship between noise and brain, noise and deafness, noise and <b>neurasthenia,</b> he proposed noise standard for all places in industrial enterprise plants in China. His work led to the issue of the first China National Noise Standard for Industry in 1980. Five years later, with more comprehensive research by analyzing 11794 noise sources of 1034 factories and investigating noise exposure conditions of 62726 workers, Danqun Fang drew up “Industrial Noise Control Design Specification” for China, which was named as [...]|$|E
2500|$|During this {{formative}} {{period of}} his work, Freud valued {{and came to}} rely on the intellectual and emotional support of his friend Wilhelm Fliess, a Berlin based ear, nose and throat specialist whom he had first met 1887. Both men saw themselves as isolated from the prevailing clinical and theoretical mainstream because of their ambitions to develop radical new theories of sexuality. Fliess developed highly eccentric theories of human biorhythms and a nasogenital connection which are today considered pseudoscientific. He shared Freud's views on the importance of certain aspects of sexuality — masturbation, coitus interruptus, and the use of condoms — in the etiology of what were then called the [...] "actual neuroses," [...] primarily <b>neurasthenia</b> and certain physically manifested anxiety symptoms. They maintained an extensive correspondence from which Freud drew on Fliess's speculations on infantile sexuality and bisexuality to elaborate and revise his own ideas. His first attempt at a systematic theory of the mind, his 'Project for a Scientific Psychology' was developed with Fliess as interlocutor.|$|E
2500|$|When {{war broke}} out, Manning was keen to enlist, {{possibly}} {{to escape from}} a stifling environment and to widen his horizons. [...] A man with his fragile constitution and unhealthy lifestyle {{was not going to}} be an attractive proposition for the military authorities, but in October 1915 after several attempts, his persistence paid off and he enrolled in the King's Shropshire Light Infantry. [...] He was a private with the service number 19022. [...] He was selected for officer training, but failed the course. [...] Sent to France in 1916, Manning experienced action with the 7th Battalion at the Battle of the Somme, was promoted to lance-corporal and experienced life in the trenches. [...] He was recalled for further training and posted to Ireland in May 1917 with a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Irish Regiment. The life of an officer did not agree with him; he seems not to have integrated particularly well and he drank excessively, getting into trouble with his superiors. [...] His inebriation was put down to <b>neurasthenia,</b> but Manning resigned his commission on 28 February 1918.|$|E
2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead.

2500|$|Cleckley argues under a {{subsection}} titled [...] "Not {{as single}} spies but in battalions" [...] (a phrase appearing in Hamlet), that although reliable statistics {{are hard to}} come by, there are various reasons to suspect both psychiatric and prison admission rates are an underestimate, and the incidence of the condition is in his opinion [...] "exceedingly high". He does present some statistics from a survey whereby he and nine other psychiatrists diagnosed 1/8th of patients as having psychopathic personality without any other mental disorder that might explain the condition, and considers that quite a few others classified as alcoholic or drug addicted would actually have qualified too. Their survey is further detailed in the book's appendix, where Cleckley clarifies it took place between 1937 and 1939 at a federal Veterans Administration hospital, located on the Southeastern seaboard, for the care of ex-service men, mainly from World War I. He critiques the 'benign policy' of the VA of not diagnosing more psychopathic personality due to giving {{the benefit of the doubt}} to issues such as <b>neurasthenia,</b> hysteria, psychasthenia, posttraumatic neuroses, or cerebral trauma from skull injuries and concussions. He concludes they have [...] "records of the utmost folly and misery and idleness over many years" [...] and if considering the number in every community who are protected by relatives, [...] "the prevalence of this disorder is seen to be appalling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smoky Dawson {{was born}} as Herbert Henry Brown on 19 March 1913 in Collingwood, Victoria. His father, Parker Frederick Peter Brown (21 November 1884 – 1957), was a {{labourer}} of Irish descent; his mother, Olive [...] "Amy" [...] Muir (ca. 1880 – June 1919), was of Scottish descent. His parents married in 1905, {{and they had}} five children, Leslie Muir Wood [...] "Les" [...] (1904–1920), Laura Olive Emily (1906–1941), Peter Frederick James (1908–1972), Herbert Henry [...] "Herbie", and Edward Parker Peter [...] "Ted" [...] (aka Ted Dawson) (1915–1978). The Browns initially lived in Melbourne and briefly moved to the rural area of Warrnambool. His father, Parker Brown, also worked in a dispensary, and had performed as a baritone under the name, Frederick Parker, at the Bijou in Melbourne. Parker had studied as a medical student before serving in World War I. He enlisted in the Australian Army in June 1915 and fought at Gallipoli from October until January 1916. He was diagnosed with <b>neurasthenia</b> and was discharged in August 1916 on medical grounds. Dawson later remembered, [...] "y dad went to Gallipoli ... but unfortunately he suffered a lot from it {{and so did the}} family". In June 1919 his mother, Amy, died of unspecified causes and the following year his brother, Les, died by drowning on Christmas Day. By that time his father had remarried.|$|E
2500|$|From mid-1865 to 1867, Roebling {{worked with}} his father on the Cincinnati-Covington Bridge (now the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge). While {{traveling}} in Europe to research wire mills, bridges and caisson foundations, his only son, John A. Roebling, II, was born. After returning in 1868, Washington became assistant engineer on the Brooklyn Bridge, and was named chief engineer after his father's death in mid-1869. He made several important improvements on the bridge design and further developed bridge building techniques. Thus, he designed the two large pneumatic caissons that became the foundations for the two towers. In 1870, fire broke out {{in one of the}} caissons; from within the caisson, Roebling directed the efforts to extinguish the flames. Working in compressed air in these caissons under the river caused him to get decompression sickness ("the bends") shattering his health and rendering him unable to visit the site, yet he continued to oversee the Brooklyn project to successful completion in 1883. Besides the bends, he may have had additional afflictions, possible <b>neurasthenia,</b> side effects of treatments, and secondary drug addiction. His wife, Emily Warren Roebling, who had taken it upon herself to learn bridge construction, became his nurse, companion, and confidant and took over much of the chief engineer's duties including day-to-day supervision and project management. [...] Although husband and wife jointly planned the bridge's continued construction, Emily successfully lobbied for formal retention of Washington as chief engineer. McCullough remarked that [...] "nowhere in the history of great undertakings is there anything comparable" [...] to Roebling conducting the largest and most difficult engineering project ever [...] "in absentia." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Paula A. Treichler's article [...] "Escaping the Sentence: Diagnosis and Discourse in 'The Yellow Wallpaper'", {{she places}} her {{focus on the}} {{relationship}} portrayed in the short story between women and writing. Rather than write about the feminist themes which view the wallpaper as {{something along the lines}} of [...] "[...] [...] the 'pattern' which underlies sexual inequality, the external manifestation of <b>neurasthenia,</b> the narrator's unconscious, the narrator's situation within patriarchy," [...] Treichler instead explains that the wallpaper can be a symbol to represent discourse and the fact that the narrator is alienated from the world in which she previously could somewhat express herself. Treichler illustrates that through this discussion of language and writing, in the story Charlotte Perkins Gilman is defying the [...] "[...] [...] sentence that the structure of patriarchal language imposes." [...] While Treichler accepts the legitimacy of strictly feminist claims, she writes that a closer look at the text suggests that the wallpaper could be interpreted as women's language and discourse, and the woman found in the wallpaper could be the [...] "[...] [...] representation of women that becomes possible only after women obtain the right to speak." [...] In making this claim, it suggests that the new struggle found within the text is between two forms of writing; one rather old and traditional, and the other new and exciting. This is supported in the fact that John, the narrator's husband, does not like his wife to write anything, which is the reason her journal containing the story is kept a secret and thus is known only by the narrator and reader. A look at the text shows that as the relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper grows stronger, so too does her language in her journal as she begins to increasingly write of her frustration and desperation.|$|E
