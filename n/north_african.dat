5|$|The War Office and the Army were concluding, at this point, {{that light}} tanks were a {{liability}} and too vulnerable {{for use in}} further combat, and the Tetrarch {{was considered to be}} obsolete. This decision may have marked the end for the Tetrarch in active service; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the <b>North</b> <b>African</b> Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense <b>North</b> <b>African</b> heat.|$|E

50|$|In 1945 French {{authorities}} counted 60,000 <b>North</b> <b>Africans.</b> Of them, {{they included}} 50,000 Kabyles, 5,000 to 6,000 Chleuh, Algerian Moroccan Arabs, and small Tunisian population. The {{numbers of students}} had decreased from the period between the World Wars, and {{only a small number}} of the <b>north</b> <b>Africans</b> included intellectuals, doctors, and lawyers. Hussey stated that initially <b>North</b> <b>Africans</b> settled the same historic communities as they did before.|$|R
50|$|The {{areas in}} Paris settled by <b>North</b> <b>Africans</b> in the 1920s and 1930s were rue des Anglais, Les Halles, and Place Maubert. In {{addition}} a Moroccan community appeared in Gennevilliers and Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine also received <b>North</b> <b>Africans.</b>|$|R

5|$|A United States Army Armored Force {{requirement}} for a mobile anti-aircraft gun {{to support the}} coming <b>North</b> <b>African</b> Campaign resulted in the T28 project being revived soon after its cancellation.

5|$|C.maenas is {{native to}} European and <b>North</b> <b>African</b> coasts {{as far as the}} Baltic Sea in the east, and Iceland and Central Norway in the north, {{and is one of the}} most common crabs {{throughout}} much of its range.

5|$|Chili-based hot sauces are {{prominent}} in Israeli food, and {{are based on}} green or red chili peppers. They are served with appetizers, felafel, casseroles and grilled meats, and are blended with hummus and tahina.

5|$|Clementine cake {{is related}} to a type of orange cake {{developed}} by the Sephardic Jews. The Sephardic Jewish community was essential to the origins of citrus cultivation in the Mediterranean in the 15th century and popularized the use of orange in baked goods. In addition to its Iberian flavors, the cake also has <b>North</b> <b>African</b> and Spanish roots.|$|E
5|$|Despite Clarke and Wavell's {{successes in}} deception, the <b>North</b> <b>African</b> {{campaign}} was turning against the Allies. In 1941 Erwin Rommel had taken command of Axis forces and won early victories. Churchill replaced Wavell with Claude Auchinleck. Clarke's new commander {{was impressed with}} Wavell's setup, so 'A' Force {{and the rest of}} Middle Eastern Command continued to operate as before.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of call similarity {{suggests that the}} Asiatic and Ethiopian races diverged from the western subspecies early in evolutionary history, and that Italian red-billed choughs are more closely allied to the <b>North</b> <b>African</b> subspecies than {{to those of the}} rest of Europe.|$|E

5|$|Morocco had {{a similar}} effect on Rix as it did on many artists who visited. Paintings were created in high-keyed colours that {{captured}} the intense <b>north</b> <b>African</b> light, and most works focussed on the figures, dress and activity of the people, or the local architecture.|$|E
5|$|Operation Flax was a Western Allied air {{operation}} executed during the Tunisia Campaign, {{as part of}} the larger <b>North</b> <b>African</b> Campaign of the Second World War.

5|$|The brigade was {{deployed}} to the <b>North</b> <b>African</b> Campaign in 1942, participating in Operation Torch, where it conducted its first amphibious assault, and earning the brigade its first campaign streamer for the battle around Algeria and French Morocco.

5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the <b>North</b> <b>African</b> population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology {{is very close to}} the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).|$|E
5|$|All {{the cats}} in this genus {{share a common}} {{ancestor}} that {{is believed to have}} lived around 6–7million years ago in the Near East (the Middle East). The exact relationships within the Felidae are close but still uncertain, e.g. the Chinese mountain cat is sometimes classified (under the name Felis silvestris bieti) as a subspecies of the wildcat, like the <b>North</b> <b>African</b> variety F. s. lybica.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the living}} {{conditions}} for black soldiers gradually improved, {{they were still}} kept in considerably worse ones {{than those of the}} white French soldiers, and the mortality rate among black soldiers was also considerably higher. Around 10,000 <b>North</b> <b>African</b> prisoners were released in 1941. Escapes and repatriations reduced the number of colonial prisoners of war to 30,000 by July 1944.|$|E
