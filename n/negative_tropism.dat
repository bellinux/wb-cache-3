40|$|Abstract – In this paper, {{structure}} and function of reactive neural control for autonomous robots are discussed. The controller utilizing discrete-time neurodynamics is applied to generate various reactive behaviors, like obstacle avoidance (<b>negative</b> <b>tropism)</b> and phototaxis (positive tropism), of two-wheeled robots. Adding additional neural networks leads to an effective modular reactive neural controller, which is then employed to reproduce these reactive behaviors, generally achieved for wheeled robots, also for walking machines with many degrees of freedom...|$|E
40|$|A novel effect—positive phototropic bending under far UV {{irradiation}} (between 260 and 305 nanometers) at low intensities—is reported. Natural compensation points (intensities {{which cause}} no bending under unilateral irradiation) have been determined for different wavelengths. The curve connecting these points, the compensation spectrum, divides the intensity-wavelength plane into areas of {{negative and positive}} tropism. It is further shown that a highly asymmetrical pattern of light stimulus within the sporangiophore underlies the symmetrical growth response at each compensation point. This suggests that some unknown additional factor is involved in perceiving a UV stimulus {{at the level of}} the photoreceptor. It is also demonstrated here that positive tropism in the UV range is due to a lens effect. We conclude that the hypothesis of optical attenuation of the stimulus (considered until now as the most plausible explanation of <b>negative</b> <b>tropism</b> in the UV spectral range) must be dismissed. The results presented here represent the first application of our quantitative theoretical consideration of spatial factors in phototropism heretofore neglected by others...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In vivo {{absorption}} {{measurements were}} made through the photo-sensitive zones of Phycomyces sporangiophores and absorption spectra are pre-sented for various growth media and for wavelengths between 400 and 580 m/z. As in mycelia, fl-carotene {{was the major}} pigment ordinarily found. The addition of diphenylamine to the growth media caused a decrease in/ 3 -carotene {{and an increase in}} certain other carotenoids. Growth in the dark substantially reduced the amount of/ 3 -carotene in the photosensitive zone; however, growth on a lactate medium failed to suppress/ 3 -carotene i the growing zone although the mycelia ppeared almost colorless. Also when diphenylamine was added to the medium the absorption in the growing zone at 460 m # was not diminished although the colored carotenoids in the bulk of the sporangiophore w re dras-ticaUy reduced. Absorption which is characteristic of the action spectra was not found. Sporangiophores immersed in fluids with a critical refractive index show neither positive nor <b>negative</b> <b>tropism.</b> Measurements were made of the critical refractive indices for light at 495 and 510 m~. The critical indices differed only slightly. Assuming primary photoreceptors at the cell wall, the change in screen-ing due to absorption appears too large to be counterbalanced solely by a simple effect of the focusing change. The possibility is therefore advanced that the receptors are internal to most of the cytoplasm; i. e., near the vacuole...|$|E
5000|$|When the posterolateral parieto-occipital [...] "approach" [...] {{system is}} damaged, {{involuntary}} purposive movements of a release-and-retract nature, such as levitation and instinctive avoidance - what Denny-Brown {{referred to as}} a <b>negative</b> cortical <b>tropism</b> - are released in the contralateral limb. [...] This is {{referred to as a}} <b>negative</b> cortical <b>tropism</b> because eliciting sensory stimuli, such as would result from tactile contact on the volar aspect of the fingers and palm of the hand, are linked to the activation of movement that reduces or eliminates the eliciting stimulation through a negative feedback connection (see discussion above in section entitled [...] "Parietal and Occipital Lobes").|$|R
40|$|The Neighbour-Sensing model brings {{together}} the basic essentials of hyphal growth kinetics into a vector-based mathematical {{model in which}} the growth vector of each virtual hyphal tip is calculated by reference to the surrounding virtual mycelium. The model predicts the growth pattern of many hyphae into three spatial dimensions and {{has been used to}} simulate complex fungal fruit body shapes. In this paper we show how the Neighbour-Sensing model can simulate growth in semi-solid substrata like agar or soil, enabling realistic simulation of mycelial colonies of filamentous fungi grown in 'Petri-dish style' experimental conditions. Newly implemented capabilities in the model include: a measurement and logging system within the program that maintains basic statistics about the mycelium it is simulating, this facilitates kinetic experimentation; inclusion of 'substrates' in the data space causing positive or <b>negative</b> <b>tropisms</b> for the growing mycelium; a horizontal plane tropism that provides a way of simulating colonies growing in or on a substratum like agar or soil by imposing a horizontal constraint on the data space the cyberhyphal tips can explore; three categories of hypha [...] standard hyphae are those that start the simulation, leading hyphae can emerge from the colony peripheral growth zone to take on a leading role, and secondary hyphae are branches that can arise late, far behind the peripheral growth zone, when mature hyphal segments resume branching to in-fill the older parts of the colony. We show how the model can be used to investigate hyphal growth kinetics in silico in experimental scenarios that would be difficult or impracticable in vivo. We also show that the Neighbour-Sensing model can generate sufficiently realistic cord-like structures to encourage the belief that this model is now sufficiently advanced for parameters to be defined that simulate specific in silico cyberfungi. The potential utility of these cyberspecies is that they provide a means to model the morphogenetic effects of a variety of factors, from environmental and nutritional features to mutations, in experimentally realistic situations, offering a valuable addition to the experimental toolkit of all those interested in fungal growth and morphology...|$|R

40|$|Faba bean (Vicia faba) {{production}} in Mediterranean and Near East agriculture is severely constrained by broomrape infection. The most widely distributed broomrape species affecting faba bean is Orobanche crenata, although O. foetida and Phelipanche aegyptiaca are of local importance. Only moderately resistant cultivars {{are available to}} farmers. Rizotrons studies allowed the dissection of resistance components in faba bean accessions against the very infective species O. crenata, O. foetida var. broteri and P. aegyptiaca, and to the inappropriate P. ramosa and O. foetida var. foetida. Results confirm that some levels of incomplete resistance are available, resulting in a reduced number of broomrape tubercles successfully formed per faba bean plant. Interestingly, the intermediate levels of resistance of cv. Baraca were operative against all broomrape populations and species studied, confirming previous reports on the stability of resistance of Baraca in field trials in different countries. Low induction of seed germination {{played a major role}} in the resistance against the inappropriate O. foetida var. foetida but not against the also inappropriate P. ramosa, neither to the infective species O. crenata, O. foetida var. broteri or P. aegyptiaca. <b>Negative</b> <b>tropism</b> of germinated seeds with radicles growing away from faba bean roots was marked for both inappropriate species but was not observed in any of the infective species. Also, a proportion of radicles that had successfully contacted faba bean roots became necrotic, failing in starting tubercle development, particularly frequent for the two inappropriate species. Such necrosis was significant also on radicles contacting resistant faba bean accessions, being particularly relevant for Spanish O. crenata population, and lower although still significant in some accessions against Syrian O. crenata and P. aegytiaca, suggesting that this might also be an operative mechanism to be selected and further exploited in faba bean resistance breeding. Even formed broomrape tubercles might later become necrotic, particularly in the case of some of the resistant faba bean accessions to the Spanish O. crenata and to P. aegyptiaca but not to the very infective Syrian O. crenata or O. foetida var. broteri...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this phase 4, single-arm, open-label study was to {{evaluate}} the safety, tolerability, efficacy, antiviral and immunological activity of maraviroc (MVC) in combination with raltegravir (RGV) and darunavir/r (DRV/r) in adult HIV- 1 infected patients (pts) with limited treatment options. HIV- 1 pts with documented virologic triple class failure or multi-drug class resistance defined {{as the presence of}} Q 151 complex, 69 insertion complex and/or&#x 2265; 3 TAMs for NRTIs and K 103 N, G 190 S+Y 181 C or Y 188 L mutants for NNRTIs and&#x 2265; 3 RAMs (L 10 F/I/R/V; M 46 I/L; I 54 V/M/L; V 82 A/F/T/S; I 84 V; L 90 M) for protease inhibitors (PIs) were offered a triple drug regimen consisting of MVC 150 mg BID, RGV 400 mg BID and DRV/r 600 / 100 mg BID. Safety, lipid profile and virologic efficacy were evaluated at week 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48. Between January 2010 and March 2012, 27 pts were enrolled. Screening failure rate was 52 % due to undetectable viral load (pVL) or non R 5 tropism type (Trofile&#x 2122;). Despite being heavily pre-treated pts, only 26 % had <b>negative</b> <b>tropism</b> test at SCR. Baseline characteristics of 13 included pts were: 77 % male, median age 43 years (IQR: 40. 1 &#x 2013; 48. 6), 38 % had a prior AIDS-defining condition. Median BSL pVL was 23, 350 cps/mL (4. 4 log 10) (IQR: 11, 236 &#x 2013; 55, 785) and median CD 4 was 222 cells/mm 3 (IQR: 179 &#x 2013; 318). Median time on NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs were 10. 7 (8. 6 &#x 2013; 13. 7), 1. 7 (1. 3 &#x 2013; 7. 6) and 5. 4 (4. 7 &#x 2013; 10) years respectively. Pts had received a median of 2 PIs (IQR: 2 &#x 2013; 3). 8 / 13 pts showed thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs), and&#x 2265; 2 were present in 5 / 13. Detectable NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) were present in 10 / 13 patients. 9 / 13 had&#x 2265; 4 primary PI RAMs. At 48 weeks, 2 pts had discontinued therapy (OIs related death (cryptococcal meningitis) = 1, withdrawn from the study on W 36 due to blips despite not achieving criteria for virologic failure= 1) and the remaining pts (11 / 13) achieved undetectable pVL and increased CD 4 in 133 cell/mm 3 from BSL (IQR: 81 &#x 2013; 174. 5). Median total cholesterol levels increased from 162 mg/dL (IQR: 135 - 188) to 215 mg/dL (IQR: 182 &#x 2013; 237) between BSL/W 48; median change in cholesterol levels: 40 mg/dL (IQR: 6. 5 - 66). Salvage therapy including MVC, RGV and DRV/r achieved sustained reductions in pVL (&# 60; 50 copies/mL) through 48 weeks of therapy in this pilot study with no treatment limiting toxicity...|$|E
