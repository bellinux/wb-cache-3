500|$|A {{significant}} plot {{element is}} House's use of Vicodin to manage pain, {{caused by an}} infarction in his quadriceps muscle five years before the show's first season, which also forces him to use a cane. In the first season, 11th episode [...] "Detox", House admits he is addicted to Vicodin, but {{says he does not}} have a problem because the pills [...] "let me do my job, and they take away my pain". His addiction has led his colleagues, Cuddy and Dr. James Wilson, to encourage him to go to drug rehabilitation several times. When he has no access to Vicodin or experiences unusually intense pain, he occasionally self-medicates with other <b>narcotic</b> <b>analgesics</b> such as morphine, oxycodone, and methadone. House also frequently drinks liquor when he is not on medical duty, and classifies himself as a [...] "big drinker". Toward the end of season five, House begins to hallucinate; after eliminating other possible diagnoses, Wilson and he determine that his Vicodin addiction is the most likely cause. House goes into denial about this for a brief time, but {{at the close of the}} season finale, he commits himself to Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital. In the following season's debut episode, House leaves Mayfield with his addiction under control. However, about a year and a half later, in season seven's 15th episode, [...] "Bombshells", House reacts to the news that Cuddy possibly has kidney cancer by taking Vicodin, and his addiction recurs.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The {{incidence}} {{of cancer in}} recent years has increased significantly. It is therefore particularly important today is the issue of provision for patients with malignancies with drugs. It is important to research the level of organization of availability of the anesthetic therapy to ensure the availability of pharmacotherapy for cancer patients worldwide. Material and methods. For {{the purpose of the study}} analyzed legislation, regulations of some states in the US that provide availability of <b>narcotic</b> <b>analgesic</b> drugs for patients with malignant neoplasms. The paper used the following methods: comparative, documentary, legal, medical, pharmaceutical and graphical analysis. Results and discussion. Noted the increase in expenditure on pharmaceutical provision for patients with malignancies on an outpatient basis in the US. During the study of the legislative and regulatory acts of the USA found that payments for treatment possible by insurance companies as part of the agreement, which in turn depend on the patient’s age, number of family members, their total income and so on. Coupons can be used to pay for the cost of medicines, but not all pharmacies accept coupons. There are charities with funds which are partially covered for the cost of chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy (analgesics, antiemetic, antipsychotics, drugs). Found, that in New York doctor may prescribe analgesic medication to the patient without limitation in the frequency and dose.

40|$|Abstract I The {{misuse of}} opiates in {{racehorses}} relates to their effect of increasing locomotor activity. Because methadone, a <b>narcotic</b> <b>analgesic,</b> has been suspected of {{use as a}} doping compound in the past, it {{was added to the}} list of banned drugs and should be considered in doping control. Because the literature fails to provide information on detection of methadone in blood or urine of horses, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed to monitor this narcotic in equine body fluids. Combined with high-performance liquid chromatography, the immunoassay also served to confirm positives indicated by screening. Following intravenous administration of methadone (0. 1 mg/kg), the drug was found for up to 24 h in blood but was never identified in urine (lO-pg/mL detection limit). Thus, urine is dismissed as a source of methadone control, and the use of blood to screen racehorses for this <b>narcotic</b> <b>analgesic</b> is suggested...|$|R
