50|$|The {{selection}} of the OR table depends on the primary use of the system. Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables. Identification of the right table is a compromise between interventional and surgical requirements. Surgical and interventional requirements may be mutually exclusive. Surgeons, especially orthopedic, general and neurosurgeons usually expect {{a table with a}} segmented tabletop for flexible patient positioning. For imaging purposes, a radiolucent tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used. Interventionalists require a floating tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, but based on their interventional experience in angiography may be used to having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table. The position of the table in the room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but <b>not</b> <b>breakable</b> tabletop that supports 3D imaging, or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging. The latter are particularly suited for neuro- or orthopedic surgery, and these integrated solutions recently also became commercially available. If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are dockable and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging. In summary, important aspects to be included considered are the position in the room, radiolucency (carbon fiber tabletop), compatibility, and integration of imaging devices with the operating table. Further aspects include table load, adjustable table height, and horizontal mobility (floating) including vertical and lateral tilt. It is important to also have proper accessories available, such as rails for mounting special surgical equipment retractors, camera holder). Free floating angiography tables with tilt and cradle capabilities are best suited for cardiovascular hybrid operating rooms.|$|E

40|$|The {{rates of}} some {{homogeneous}} isotopic exchange reactions in solution are {{considered in the}} light of a recently developed quantitative theory of redox processes (Part I). The relative importance of several factors influencing the rates of these reactions is discussed. These factors include the Coulombic repulsion between the ionic reactants and the extent of solvation of the ions. Free energies and entropies of activation of various reactions are calculated from the theory without the use of any adjustable parameters. The agreement with the experimental data is considered to be satisfactory. On the basis of the theory and of earlier experiments in heavy water an experimental method is tentatively suggested for distinguishing electron and atom transfer mechanisms.

Considerable controversy, and conflict, both public and private, began more or less immediately, sometimes called the crypto wars. They have not yet subsided. In many countries, for example, export of cryptography is subject to restrictions. Until 1996 export from the U.S. of cryptography using keys longer than 40 bits (too small to be very secure against a knowledgeable attacker) was sharply limited.

In addition, we demonstrate that the pH values can be extracted from the molalities of CO 2 (aq) and HCO 3 –. The results are in very good agreement with those obtained from direct spectrophotometric measurements using colored indicators.

The eukaryotic processes of {{gene expression}} permit expansion of DNA cryptography into complex networks of transcriptional and translational coding interactions. I describe a method of coding messages into genes and their regulatory sequences, transcription products, regulatory protein complexes, transcription proteins, translation proteins and other required sequences. These codes then {{serve as the basis for}} a cryptographic model based on the processes of gene expression. The protocol provides a hierarchal structure that extends from the initial coding of a message into a DNA code (ciphergene), through transcription and ultimately translation into a protein code (cipherprotein). The security is based upon unique knowledge of the DNA coding process, all of the regulatory codes required for expression, and their interactions. This results in a set of cryptographic protocols that is capable of securing data at rest, data in motion and providing an evolvable form of security between two or more parties. The conclusion is that implementation of these protocols will enhance security and substantially burden cyberattackers to develop new forms of countermeasures...|$|R
40|$|Okinawa {{is often}} {{described}} as a 2 ̆ 2 society of kyouyukai 2 ̆ 2, a term which refers to an association consisting of Okinawan people who migrated from the same home villages to more urban city areas. In comparison with their counterparts in mainland Japan, Okinawan migratory people have demonstrated some distinctive characteristics by reproducing their own traditional customs and lifestyles through kyouyukai even in an alien urban environment. The formation of kyouyukai has been encouraged by the fact that members have common living and cultural experiences in their home villages. In other words, the statement that 2 ̆ 2 Okinawa is a society of kyouyukai 2 ̆ 2 presupposes that Okinawa consists of a number of village communities. Many studies in the area of Adult Education have tended to treat cities and the villages as entirely separate entities when analyzing the educational aspects of migration movements between villages and urban areas. Surprisingly, however, too few of them take account of the fact that many urban residents had in fact originally migrated from villages. Specifically, the majority of previous discussions only succeeds in explaining urban development in terms of {{the increase in the number}} of migratory people and fails to address how their hometown communities and current living environment have affected the formation of their identity and the sense of belonging. This paper intends to address this deficiency in previous studies by focusing on the educational roles played by kyouyukai during the process of urban settlement and on the relationships between kyouyukai and home villages after the initial settlement has been completed. More specifically, the paper analyzes the educational aspects of kyouyukai in the following three ways. First, the paper highlights the differences and relationships between home villages (which primarily provided educational and everyday cultural backgrounds to migratory people) and kyouyukai, which are considered to form a para-community of hometown communities. Second, the paper points out that shared experience of everyday cultural activities in home villages has been a significant binding force for kyouyukai. Third, the paper illustrates the fact that communal ties in these home villages are <b>not</b> easily <b>breakable</b> and a sense of unity and yuimahru (an Okinawan concept connoting a spirit of mutual support) are strongly maintained no matter where Okinawan people migratc to...|$|R
40|$|Provedena je analiza Jr 31, 31 - 34 u ovome članku pokazala da novi Savez nije samo obnovljeni stari Savez (Ch. Levin), da nije restitutio ad integrum te da nije u bitnome istovjetan sa starim Savezom (N. Lohfink, E. Zenger). Unatoč mnogim elementima iz prethodnoga Saveza koji ulaze i u »novi«, potrebno je istaknuti da je u Jr 31, 31 - 34 posrijedi ipak veliki kvalitativni skok koji nismo zabilježili u dotadašnjem govoru o savezu između Boga i ljudi. Prije svega, novi Savez se neće moći raskinuti nikakvim čovjekovim djelima i ostaje posve neuvjetovan kao potpuni čin slobode, dok su se drugi savezi u prošlosti mogli razvrći. U tom je novina novoga Saveza, jer on na određen način ostaje vječni Savez. Drugo, u prethodnoj Božjoj objavi Bog je govorio narodu »izvana«, preko proroka, svećenika. Dakle Tora je posredovana izvana kao zakon koji je trebalo izvršavati. Istina je da postoji smjer u proročkoj objavi kad Bog sve više i više ulazi u proročki život i tako njegova riječ postaje proročka riječ, a proročka riječ Božja riječ. No to je daleko od bilo kakva poistovjećivanja. Novi Savez pak predstavlja stapanje Božje i ljudske volje u jednu stvarnost. Konačno, rezultat takva Božjega djelovanja bit će i opraštanje svih grijeha kako pojedincima tako i cijeloj zajednici. Novi Savez u svom konačnom domašaju znači stvaranje novoga čovjeka u kojem će Božja volja činiti vertikalu ali i stvaranje novoga svijeta u kojem će taj čovjek činiti novu zajednicu u horizontali. The article, »The Features and Meaning of the New Covenant (berit hadasah) in Jeremiah 31 : 31 - 34 « {{analyses}} {{this text}} {{about the new}} covenant with a historical, critical, structural and semantic perspective. Namely, Jeremiah 31 : 31 - 34 is a unique passage {{not only in the}} Book of Jeremiah but also in the entire Old Testament. It is perceived as the peak of the Old Testament and a text with which it is possible to build bridges between the Old and New Testaments {{while at the same time}} destroying them. A proper interpretation can contribute to proper relations between Christians and Jews. Exegeses attribute the text to Deuteronomy, while today, to post-Deuteronomic succession even though they see certain traces of Jeremiah 2 ̆ 7 s thoughts in it. Taking into account its meaning and reception this text has its greatest significance in the Old Testament. Heb 8 : 8 - 12 cites this text and it is the longest citation in the Old and New Testaments. berit hadasah - new covenant - can be found only in this particular place in the Old Testament. In analysing the text Jr 31 : 31 - 34 we started from the results of historical-critical research. At first, doubts were raised about Jeremiah being the author of this text (B. Duhm, R. Smend). Later, it was believed that Jeremiah had significant influence on elements of the text (P. Volz, G. von Rad), followed by theories of Deuteronomic reviews (W. Thiel, S. Herrmann, S. Bohmer), to the latest theories of post-Deuteronomic amendments (W. Groft). Research then became intensive considering the actual term berit hadasah: whether this means the old but improved covenant - restitutio ad integrum (Chr. Levin) or in fact a »new covenant« which in essence is qualitatively identical to the covenant of Sinai (N. Lohfink), or the new covenant continues on from the old despite some differences (E. Zenger). An analysis in an exegetic-theological context of Jr 31 : 31 - 34 sets the text in the »Book of Consolation«, (Jr 31 - 33) and notes that within the five prophecies of redemption, this text about the new covenant has a central place. An analysis of the actual text 31 : 31 - 34 shows that the text represents the promise that is evident in the use of the future form of the verb krt. A lingual analysis shows the significance of the personal pronouns I - they where the I relates to God 2 ̆ 7 s emphasised actions compared to those who belong to the fathers and people that the Lord led out of Egypt, but equally so with current Judea and Israel. This creates a continuation in the violation of the covenant. On the contrary, God gives a »new covenant« to the heart of the people and nation. The consequence of that covenant on an anthropological basis is the realisation of God without limits, and of the forgiveness of sins. Above all it is important that the new covenant will <b>not</b> be <b>breakable.</b> Are the old and new covenants identical? From the analysis we find: if the covenant is observed from God 2 ̆ 7 s perspective it is the same because it has the same intention by God and the same recipients are in question if the »new covenant« however, is observed from a human perspective then the »new covenant« is indeed new in some vital elements: God 2 ̆ 7 s and human will be one, the new covenant shall be realised and executed from within hence there will be no need for mediators, the new covenant will not be able to be broken and finally there will be a radical forgiveness of sins. The Old covenant was the law that acted outside while the new is founded on anthropology and creates a new man and then a new community. Is the new covenant old or new? It is old and new. Old - if there is continuity between the old and new but new because it represents a new beginning of a quality relationship that is different between God and people...|$|R
