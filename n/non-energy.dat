50|$|For Washington {{state in}} particular, energy related {{emissions}} are the dominant source of GHG emissions and have increased from 61.2 MMT CO2-equivalent (CO2-e) in 1990 (excluding residual fuel for transportation) to 74.6 MMT CO2-e in 2004, while their share {{has increased from}} 79% of total emissions to 85% over the past fourteen years. Carbon dioxide is the dominant GHG followed by methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbon and sulfur hexafluoride. <b>Non-energy</b> industrial global greenhouse gas emissions have lowered from 14% to 9%,mainly due to reduced emissions from aluminum production. This has {{been the result of}} two key elements: process changes that reduced CO2 and PFC emissions per ton of aluminumgenerated, and the post-2000 decline in aluminum manufacturing rates. <b>Non-energy</b> agriculturalgreenhouse emissions have remained fairly constant but their percentage contribution has lowered as total emissions have increased. Here is a broken down list of pollution contributors in Washington State: 45% transportation, 16% in state electricity generation, 12% industry, 9% residential and commercial, 2% non-CO2 (other gasses), 9% industry (<b>non-energy),</b> 7% agriculture (<b>non-energy).</b> As you can see, the majority of energy GHG emissions and almost half of total emissions are from the transportation sector.|$|E
