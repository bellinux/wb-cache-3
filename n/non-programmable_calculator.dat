50|$|The {{practical}} examination {{consists of}} tasks which {{are designed to}} assess participants' abilities to carry out scientific investigations in earth science inquiries. Participants are allowed to bring <b>non-programmable</b> <b>calculators</b> for the examinations. Sometimes special tool are provides as telescopes, geology compass, meteorological instruments and so on.The top twenty or so, students who qualify the entrance test for IESO are called for the training camp whose duration is about 20 days. On the basis of performance of these students the final team is selected which represents the particular country at the International Competition.|$|R
40|$|Notes: 1. Students failing the mid-term test (less than 15 out of 30) will be {{evaluated}} by a scheme, which adds {{the percentage of}} the test to that of the final exam. * This procedure will also be adopted for assignments and individually, if it results in a higher percentage for the student. 2. Students earning less than 45 % (less than 27 out of 60) in the final exam will fail the course. * * Only the use of <b>non-programmable</b> <b>calculators</b> is allowed during tests and the final exam. 3. Failure to complete all project requirements will result in a grade of N being awarded for the course. - 2 -The final grade obtained from the above marking scheme will be based on the following percentage-to-grade point conversion...|$|R
50|$|INPhO {{consists}} of, usually, about 6 subjective problems, {{which the}} students must solve in 3 hours.Use of a <b>non-programmable</b> scientific <b>calculator</b> is usually allowed, {{as long as it}} has less than 4 lines in its display, no graphing feature and no CAS-like functionality.The total marks vary each year.Earlier, the syllabus matched that of IPhO, but now, it is broadly equivalent to the syllabus of NSEP.It was changed for the convenience of students studying for the IIT JEE and the physics olympiad, at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{programmer}} functions, the calculator's {{abilities are}} limited to basic arithmetic (and reciprocal and square root), which meant that typical users would also make use of a general scientific calculator. Floating-point numbers are only supported for base 10. However, it is still far more powerful (though also much more expensive) than contemporary competitors such as the <b>non-programmable</b> computer math <b>calculator</b> Casio CM-100 or the TI , LCD Programmer or Programmer II.|$|R
40|$|Thousands of {{students}} are preparing for chemistry examinations in June. An unresolved debate is whether they {{should be permitted to}} use graphics and programmable calculators in those examinations. Some educators have not only advocated the use of graphics calculators, but have also pointed to the Danish system in which students are permitted to use computers in senior school examinations. In some Australian jurisdictions, graphics calculators are permitted in year 12 mathematics examinations, but not in chemistry examinations. The reasoning is that information or methods of solving numerical chemical problems can be stored in the memory of graphics calculators, giving some students an unfair advantage. This means that chemistry students either {{have to learn how to}} use (and buy!) two types of calculators or, if they only have one calculator, are disadvantaged in using <b>non-programmable</b> <b>calculators</b> in mathematics examinations. The use of technology (or its lack thereof) can limit how and what students learn. “The mechanics of computation and human thought” is an allusion to Asimov’s short story, “A Feeling of Power” in which, overuse of technology has caused people to forget how to do simple arithmetic. In our current assessment system, the insistence that students must be able to do simple chemical calculations has lead to underuse of available technology. The misperception is that the ability to do calculations is linked to understanding of concepts. Graphics calculators, programmable calculators and computers are tools. Instead of banning or limiting technology, we should take the opportunity to rethink what is being assessed and how it is assessed. It is the proper use of technology, by combining the mechanics of computation and human thought to deepen understanding and to ask probing questions that truly leads to a feeling of power...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 83 - 91). Technology {{is being}} integrated in education {{at large and}} in mathematics teaching and learning in particular. This study is an action research conducted in math classes in Lebanon. The purpose of this thesis is to study whether integration of technology in teaching quadratic functions affects students’ understanding, critical thinking and problem solving abilities, and whether it changes their attitudes towards mathematics. The sample is composed of two grade 10 classes of a French school in Lebanon. The total number of participants is 47 out of which 28 are girls. In the experimental group, the programmable calculator Casio Class pad 330 and the DGS Geogebra were integrated in teaching, while in the control group, the <b>non-programmable</b> scientific <b>calculator</b> was the only device used in teaching. The pre-test, post-test method is applied to compare students’ achievement and problem solving abilities, {{in each of the}} groups before and after instruction, as well as to compare the achievement of the control and experimental groups after instruction. In addition, a questionnaire is filled after instruction by all participants to compare control and experimental groups’ attitudes, and interviews are conducted with students from the experimental group {{in order to get a}} more analytical insight in their attitudes toward the use of technology in math learning. Although the pre-test results yielded better achievement by the control group, the quantitative analysis of the post-test showed that the experimental group’s achievement has improved over time. The post-test results were not significantly different after instruction. However, the questionnaires showed that the attitudes of students exposed to technology are significantly more positive than those of the control group. The interviews with the experimental group students revealed a clear increase in their interest in, and willingness to learn mathematics. 1 bound copy: xii, 130 leaves; ill, facsims; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R
