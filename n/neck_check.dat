Background: One of {{the most}} common {{clinical}} decisions a Sports and Exercise Medicine (SEM) physician is required to make is whether an athlete presenting with symptoms or signs of an acute illness can participate in exercise training or competition. Currently, a clinical tool, known as the ‘neck check’ is used to determine eligibility to participate in exercise training or competition athletes with acute illness. This original clinical tool, first described about 20 years ago, was based mainly on an abbreviated medical history and findings of a clinical examination were excluded. Symptoms of illness ‘above-the-neck’ e. g. sneezing, rhinorrhoea or sinus congestion constitute a ‘passed’ “neck check”, whereas ‘below-the-neck’ symptoms e. g. cough and/or systemic symptoms such as fever and myalgia, constitute a ‘failed’ “neck check”. However, in the current literature, there remain very few data regarding 1) the adherence of athletes to advice given following a ‘neck check’, and 2) whether the exercise performance (e. g. the ability to finish a race) or the development of medical complications during exercise is different in athletes who “passed” or “failed” the ‘neck check’. Objective The main objectives of this dissertation are: 1) to review the available evidence with respect to medical assessment and participation risk in endurance runners presenting with symptoms of acute illness before a road race; 2) to document the range of acute illnesses in runners presenting in the 3 days before a race; 3) to determine adherence to advice given by medical staff to these runners, and 4) {{to determine the effects of}} the outcomes of the medical assessment on running performance particularly, the ability to finish the race and the medical complications experienced during the race. These data are important to improve the medical care of runners (and other athletes) presenting with acute illness before training and competition. Methods: Phase 1 : Review of the literature All literature relating to the epidemiology of acute illness in athletes, risk factors for illness, and participation risk, potential medical complications and effects on performance of exercising whilst ill were sourced using established electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar). In addition, literature related to the background of the ‘neck check’, as well as the evolution of the current RTP guidelines in athletes with acute illness were sourced. Phase 2 : Research study In a prospective cohort study, 242 runners who presented to a pre-race registration medical facility with medical concerns were assessed by SEM physicians by means of medical history and physical examination (if indicated) using a specific Pre-Race acute Illness Medical Assessment (PRIMA group). 172 of these runners had evidence suggesting acute infective illness (PRIMA-I group) and 70 runners had non-infective complaints (PRIMA-N/I group). The epidemiology (prevalence rate = % runners) of runners with symptoms, signs and specific clinical diagnoses of acute illnesses were documented in the PRIMA-I group. Following clinical evaluation, all the runners in the PRIMA-I group were then advised regarding clearance to run the race, monitoring symptoms, or not running the race, using the ‘neck check’ as a guideline. Runners in the PRIMA cohort were then tracked during and immediately after the race, and the following parameters were compared to those in a control group of runners not presenting to the medical facility at registration (CON= 53 734) : 1) incidence of not starting of the race (per 1000 runners) (DNS rate), 2) incidence of not finishing the race in those who started (per 1000 runners) (DNF rate), and 3) incidence of medical complications during the race in those who started (per 1000 runners) (MC rate). Results Phase 1 : Review The main finding of the review is the relative paucity in clinical data with respect to participation in athletes with acute illness. Upper respiratory tract symptoms are very common in athletes, and the risk factors are discussed. Furthermore, there are different aetiologies underlying athletes’ URT symptoms (other than infection). The documented risks of exercising when systemically ill include sudden cardiac death and reduced pulmonary function, splenic rupture in patients with infectious mononucleosis, and dehydration and electrolyte disturbances when exercising with acute gastro-intestinal illness. There is little evidence in the literature regarding the effects of illness on performance; these include reduced performance, non-participation and the potential effects of WARI (wheezing after respiratory tract infection). Evidence supporting the two aspects of the <b>neck</b> <b>check</b> is reviewed: the presumed safety of exercising with localised URT symptoms, and the perceived risk of exercising with lower respiratory tract or systemic symptoms. Clinical data are severely lacking, and the available data are based on self-reported symptomatology. There are no published data regarding the use of the ‘neck check’ as a participation guideline. Phase 2 : In the PRIMA-I cohort of 172 runners, the most common symptoms were sinus congestion (40. 1 %), cough (38. 2 %), sore throat (37. 8 %) and runny nose (25. 6 %). More than half the cohort (57. 5 %) had a diagnosis of localised URTI. However, URTI with generalised symptoms was the single most common diagnosis (22. 7 %). In the PRIMA-I group, 41. 3 % of the runners failed the ‘neck check’. Compared with the CON group, there was no significant difference in the DNS rate in the PRIMA-I group. However, in those runners who were advised not to run, the DNS rate was 565 per 1000 runners, and this was significantly higher than that of the CON group (192 per 1000 runners) (p< 0. 0001). PRIMA-I race starters had a higher DNF rate (31 per 1000 runners), and runners with any medical concerns (PRIMA group) had a significantly higher DNF rate (37 per 1000 runners) compared to the CON group of runners who started the race (15 per 1000 runners) (p= 0. 0329). There were no documented medical complications in the PRIMA-I group who started the race, while the MC rate of the CON group was 6. 7 per 1000 runners. In runners in the PRIMA-I group who had been advised not to run, 43. 5 % were non-adherent, and started the race despite this advice. Conclusion: Our study indicates that localised upper respiratory tract infection is responsible for the majority of acute illness in a pre-race cohort of runners. Furthermore, the data provide some evidence that it is safe for runners with acute illness to exercise if they pass the ‘neck check’. However, presenting to a pre-race registration medical facility, failing the ‘neck check’ and receiving advice against participation appear to increase the risk of not finishing a race. There is also concern about the high rate of non-adherence to advice given by the SEM physician. Finally, a pre-race registration medical assessment for runners with acute illness may reduce the risk of developing short-term medical complications during the race...|$|E

Feeling pressure on his <b>neck</b> and <b>checking</b> up he couldn't break the hold or picking Kanaya up, Yokoyama pushed forward until placing his opponent's head against the main pillar of the dojo and started ramming it against the column. As this action wasn't specifically forbidden, the referee couldn't disqualify Yokoyama, but he hurried to stop the match and declare a draw to save Kanaya from further injury. This violent finish increased Sakujiro's reputation as the most feared fighter in Kodokan.|$|R

Neuropraxia of the great auricular nerve (GAN) is an uncommon complication of shoulder surgery, with the patient in the beach chair position. We report a case of great auricular neuropraxia associated with direct compression by a horseshoe headrest, used in routine positioning for uncomplicated shoulder surgery. In this case, an arthroscopic approach was taken, under regional anesthesia with sedation in the beach chair position. The GAN, a superficial branch of the cervical plexus, is vulnerable to neuropraxia due to its superficial anatomical location. We recommend that for the procedures of the beach chair position, the auricle be protected and covered with cotton and gauze to avoid direct compression and the position of the head and <b>neck</b> be <b>checked</b> and corrected frequently.

40|$|There are {{previous}} {{reports of}} the identification of radiopaque medications on abdominal X-rays or computed tomography (CT). We describe an interesting case of the incidental identification of a radiopaque medication on cervical spinal CT following cervical spinal surgery. A sixty seven-year-old male patient with Parkinson’s disease (PD) visited our emergency center with a C 5 - 6 dislocation and fracture. Surgery was performed with open reduction and pedicle screw fixation through the posterior approach. No abnormal events occurred during the perioperative period. However, a radiopaque incidental foreign body {{in front of the}} C 6 vertebrae was found on a cervical spinal CT and X-rays that were performed as routine examinations on postoperative day 3. After 6 hours, we performed gastrofibroscopy (GFS) but were unable to find anything. Therefore, we checked all of his medications related to the <b>neck</b> and <b>check</b> X-ray again. One enteric-coated pill he had taken exhibited strong radiodensity. Although our patient underwent an unnecessary GFS, every spinal surgeon should keep in mind that radiopaque pills can appear similar to spinal instruments on X-ray and CT. In addition, we should also know the associated dysphagia is a possible cause of the delayed passage of medicine in PD with or without cervical osteophytes...|$|R

To prove his point, Spike squashes Tom into an accordion before walking off, reminding his pal once again to just whistle. Seeing an opportunity to provoke Tom, Jerry picks up a tiny board and challenges the cat to a fight, who flicks the board away and prepares to punch the mouse. Then Jerry whistles before Spike zooms in and his own punch lands onto his Tom's face, which leaves the cat dazed in front of a mailbox behind him. Once again, Spike reminds to Jerry: [...] "Anytime, chum".|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of voicing the string instruments {{is well known}} among performers, musicians and violinmakers. Voicing provokes changes in mechanical and acoustical behavior of the sound chest. As a consequence of these changes, the propagation way of mechanical and acoustical propagation in the instrument is different. In this paper the acoustical parameters related to damping, e. g. the loss factor, have been measured in a cello {{before and after the}} voicing of the instrument carried out by the performer, a student of the Faculty of Cultural Musical Heritage Preservation of the University of Bologna. From the measured impulse responses, a slight difference in the propagation of the mechanical wave has been found particularly among the chest, close up to the bridge and to the <b>neck.</b> As a <b>check</b> of the results, also some measurements of driving-point impedance at the bridge, excited in different points, have been carried out, by using a head-impedance hammer, on the bridge...|$|R
6000|$|The {{distance}} between the ranch and the outlaws' cave was not so great but that any mustang in the plains could have traversed it in a day, but the cruel man had {{made up his mind}} that the captain's charger should do it in a few hours. It is not so much distance as pace that kills. Had any consideration whatever been extended to the noble creature by the ignoble brute who rode it, the good horse would have galloped {{to the head of the}} Trap almost without turning a hair. At first he strode out over the rolling prairie with the untiring vigour of a well-made frame and a splendid constitution, leaping the little cracks and inequalities of the ground in the exuberance of his strength; though there was no need to bound, and coursing over the knolls as easily as he cantered down the hollows, while his flashing eye betokened at once a courageous and a gentle spirit. But when the lower slopes of the hills were reached, and steepish gradients were met with here and there, the horse began to put back first one ear and then the other, and sometimes both, as if in expectation of the familiar [...] "well done," [...] or pat on the <b>neck,</b> or <b>check</b> of the rein with which the captain had been wont to sanction a slackening of the pace, but no such grace was allowed him. On the contrary, when the first symptom appeared of a desire to reduce speed Jake drove his cruel spurs into the charger's glossy side. With a wild snort and bound the horse stretched out again and spurned the ground as if in indignant surprise.|$|R
30|$|Surgical {{management}} of the fractures was performed after initial assessment and resuscitation. The patients were placed supine on a fracture table. Closed reduction was achieved in all cases under traction with slight abduction and internal rotation. In cases of open fractures, wound debridement and closure preceded the femoral shaft nailing. The reconstruction nail was inserted after reduction of the shaft fracture. Careful X-ray monitoring during reaming and nail insertion was carried out to prevent displacement of the neck fracture. Bone grafting was not performed even in cases of severe comminution. Following the insertion of the nail, accurate reduction of the femoral <b>neck</b> fracture was <b>checked</b> for again prior to proximal screw insertion. In all but two cases, a single proximal 10.5 -mm interlocking screw at 125 ° insertion angle (Long Gamma nail, Stryker) {{was used for the}} fixation of the neck fracture. In the remaining two patients, a Russel-Taylor Delta reconstruction nail (Smith & Nephew Richards Inc. Memphis, Tennessee USA) with two proximal screws was inserted. An attempt was made to place the neck screw in the centre of the femoral head in both frontal and lateral views. The femoral neck fracture was provisionally stabilized with Steinmann pins to prevent displacement or rotational malalignment of during drilling. Distal locking was performed with either one or two screws. Fluoroscopy was routinely used to confirm correct placement of proximal and distal locking screws in orthogonal views. Concomitant fractures were addressed; a pelvic external fixator was applied for the patient with the ischiopubic fracture and internal fixation performed for the ulna and patella fractures.|$|R
