In US and European Union law, notice and takedown is mandated as part of limited liability, or safe harbour, provisions for online hosts (see the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998 and the Electronic Commerce Directive 2000). As a condition for limited liability online hosts must expeditiously remove or disable access to content they host when they are notified of the alleged illegality.|$|E

When Russell tries to kiss Phoebe one afternoon, she tells Stephen who demands Russell moves out. However, this is problematic as Russell intends to stay until the lease expires. After Stephen lashes out and punches Russell, he has him charged with assault and then pays Stephen rent at the last minute to avoid eviction. It is revealed that Russell had spent time in a mental institution after suffering a breaking down following his wife and baby leaving him, due to his drug use.|$|R

5000|$|Notice and {{takedown}} {{has been}} criticised for over-blocking or take down of non-infringing content. In 2001 the Electronic Frontier Foundation launched a collaborative clearinghouse for notice and takedown requests, known as Chilling Effects. Researchers {{have been using}} the clearinghouse to study the use of cease-and-desist demands, primarily looking at DMCA 512 takedown notices, but also non-DMCA copyright issues, and trademark claims. A 2005 study into the DMCA <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>down</b> process by Jennifer Urban and Laura Quilter from the Samuelson Law, Technology and Public Policy Clinic concluded that [...] "some notices are sent {{in order to accomplish}} the paradigmatic goal of 512 - the inexpensive takedown of clearly infringing hosted content or links to infringing web sites". However, on the basis of data on such notices the study concluded that the DMCA <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>down</b> process [...] "is commonly used for other purposes: to create leverage in a competitive marketplace, to protect rights not given by copyright (or perhaps any other law), and to stifle criticism, commentary and fair use". However, it is misleading to conclude that these problems do not arise under the E-Commerce Directive, which does not provide for a statutory notice and take-down procedure, since these chilling effects are a specific problem of provider liability as such.|$|E

However, the statute describes two ways in which an OSP can be put on notice of infringing material on its system: 1) notice from the copyright owner, known as <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>down,</b> and 2) the existence of [...] "red flags." ...|$|E

5000|$|A YouTube {{copyright}} {{strike is}} a copyright policing practice used by YouTube {{for the purpose}} of managing copyright infringement and complying with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is the basis for the design of the YouTube copyright strike system. For YouTube to retain DMCA safe harbor protection, it must respond to copyright infringement claims with a <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>down</b> process. YouTubes own practice is to issue a [...] "YouTube copyright strike" [...] on the user accused of copyright infringement.

5000|$|The Electronic Commerce Directive, {{unlike the}} Digital Millennium Copyright Act, did not define so called notice and action {{procedures}} under article 14 of the Directive. Member states implemented diverging approaches on {{the duty to}} act expeditiously and on when an online host obtains [...] "actual knowledge" [...] in relation to notifications. Inconsistent approaches to whether online service providers, such as search engines or social media networks, fall within the definition of online host, under article 14 developed across the EU. As a result, notice and takedown procedures are fragmented across EU member states and online hosts face considerable legal uncertainty. The European Commission consulted on notice and action procedures under article 14 in 2010, and has launched a new initiative in June 2012. The European Commission observed that [...] "Online intermediaries face high compliance costs and legal uncertainty because they typically have operations across Europe, but the basic rules of Article 14 are interpreted in different ways by different national courts (sometimes even within the same member state)." [...] As part of the initiative the European Commission intends to clarify which online service providers fall within the article 14 definition of online hosts. The initiative assesses whether different categories of illegal content require different notice and action approaches.It seems that in 2013 the European Commission`s notice and action initiative {{has come to a}} halt. The reason for this is unclear. One aspect might be to avoid bad publicity, since <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>down</b> is associated with chilling effects on free speech as described above. The other reason might be the following problem: the EU Commission already made it quite clear that it does not want to change the Electronic Commerce Directive - while indeed it seems impossible to provide legal certainty in the take down process without a binding legal underpinning.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the legislation, doctrinal {{opinions}} and relevant case law regarding the liability of intermediary service providers in Romania and to contribute to the current stage of knowledge in this matter. The objectives pursued by the author are: identification of the peculiarities of the transposition of the E-Commerce Directive into Romanian legislation; identification of problems that could arise from law’s interpretation; issuing of the de lege ferenda proposals. According to Romanian Law, the rule is the liability of the intermediary service provider. The liability limitations apply to certain clearly delimited activities carried out by service providers, precisely defined by art. 12 - 15 from Law no. 362 / 2002, as: mere conduit, caching, hosting, search engines and hyperlinks. Romanian Law does not offer the possibility to impose on service provider an obligation to monitor the information they transmit or store or an obligation to actively seek out facts and circumstances, even if it could be only for specific, clearly defined individual case. The <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>down</b> procedures for illegal content is not a legal obligation according to Romanian Law. The Romanian Law is mandatory only for service providers established in Romania...|$|E
40|$|Defamation {{has been}} a fertile ground of {{litigation}} and has never failed to present new challenges to the courts in different jurisdictions in the Internet age. In 2013, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (Hong Kong) finally {{had a chance to}} decide on the liability of online service providers in the case of Oriental Press Group Ltd. v. Fevaworks Solutions Ltd. The highest court in Hong Kong confirmed the decisions of the lower courts and ruled that a provider of online discussion forum has to bear legal liabilities for defamatory remarks posted by third parties,and therefore, when it has received notification from the complainant it has a duty to remove the concerned remarks within reasonable time. Seemingly, this approach on liability is in line with the legal positions in other jurisdictions which are based largely on a <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>down</b> regime. However, a careful analysis of the Feva judgment reveals that the Hong Kong court reaches this conclusion through an extension of common law principles in holding online intermediaries of discussion forum as ‘secondary publishers’ with liabilities being imposed from the outset, but provided with the defence of innocent dissemination. This article explains why this interpretation of common law is unsatisfactory, and argues that a statutory solution will provide a better answer to solve the conundrum on online intermediaries’ liabilities in defamation disputes...|$|E
40|$|Australia {{wants to}} foster {{innovation}} {{in a digital}} economy, but our copyright laws discourage businesses from investing in new technologies and {{make it harder for}} individuals to access the knowledge upon which innovation is based. Yesterday’s US decision in the Google Books case shows why US copyright law is much more supportive of innovation than ours. The long, drawn out litigation between the Authors Guild and Google has reached a conclusion: Google’s ambitious mass-digitisation project, to scan the world’s books and make them discoverable online, is “fair use”. Normally, scanning books counts as an infringement of copyright – the law prohibits people from making copies of books without permission. “Fair use” is the safety valve in this system: it enables people to do things with copyright works that are in the public interest. Without fair use, many socially valuable reuses of copyright material would require the explicit permission of the copyright owner in advance. Seeking permission is a real problem; often, it is impossible to track the owner down, because copyright is automatic and lasts for 70 -plus years after the author’s death. Even when the owners can be found, sometimes they refuse to give a licence, or charge a price that is unaffordable. Fair use enables a balance of sorts: it allows people to reuse copyright material in ways that are valuable to society and not too harmful to the copyright owner. This Google Books decision means a massive digitisation project, with huge social benefits for access to knowledge, is legal under US law. Unfortunately, this would never be possible in Australia. Australia doesn’t have “fair use”; instead, we have a set of “fair dealing” defences, which allow people to make a very limited range of uses. These include research and study, criticism and review, parody and satire, and news reporting. We also have a few very technology specific exceptions – it’s permissible to make a digital copy of a VHS tape but not a book. You’re allowed to copy the music on a CD to a MP 3 player but not a movie from a DVD to a tablet. Google couldn’t digitise books in Australia; without fair use, it’s not possible to fit innovative new technologies into old, inflexible categories. Google probably couldn’t even make a search engine in Australia: without fair use, there’s no exception for indexing and searching web pages. YouTube certainly couldn’t have started in Australia: in the US, there are “safe harbours” that protect organisations from copyright infringement claims when their users infringe copyright, {{as long as there is}} a <b>notice</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> <b>down</b> scheme in place. Australia’s equivalent is drafted so narrowly that it excludes almost everyone who would want to rely on it.   Sergey Sus  Enhancing the market Ten years ago, Google had an ambitious plan to bring the world’s paper books into the digital age. Many books are only available in libraries. Others are obscure and difficult to track down. Google wanted to do for books what it had already done for the web: make the unruly mess of existing information searchable, available at our fingertips. It set out to digitise more than 20 million books, at a fairly heavy cost which it was prepared to bear. Google knew that it could never get permission in advance from every author and publisher, so it used the same logic that applies to its search engine: making a digital copy of a book, just like a web page, that serves mainly to help readers and potential customers to find the books they are looking for, must be fair use. The Court found Google’s use was not likely to hurt copyright owners. While Google’s use is commercial, it doesn’t sell the books. It doesn’t allow people to view more than a snippet of the book (unless the publisher explicitly allows it), so it doesn’t provide a way for consumers to avoid paying for books. It doesn’t run ads on the webpages that include snippets of the book.   Google  If anything, the Court found, it might enhance the market by providing authors with an opportunity to have older books noticed and searchable, rather than languishing on bookstore and library shelves. On top of helping discovery, Google helps channel money to publishers and authors by providing links to online retailers where each book can be purchased. The decision is an important win for Google. But it’s also important for society because it helps people get access to the world’s knowledge and culture. In an information economy, such access is crucial for learning, personal growth, creative play and innovation. The project also has other valuable uses: it allows new forms of research into our culture through data mining, and it allows unprecedented access to blind people, who for many years have been facing a book famine, where only 1 - 5 % of books have been available in any accessible form. Digitising heritage   Viewminder  Given the great social benefits of the project, we might wish that our public institutions had played a greater role in digitising our shared heritage, but governments have been slow to invest in these types of projects. It took a giant company like Google to take a risk and see whether it could create a project that would be both profitable for itself and good for society. The decision means progress and social access cannot be halted by the fears of publishers and authors who are not willing to invest to make their works available online but are also not willing to allow others to do it. It is worth noting many publishers see Google Books as a good deal – it helps drive sales, after all. But the structure of copyright law means Google needed permission from each copyright owner, regardless of whether it could actually find them or not. This decision means that, where Google is performing a socially valuable function, it’s not harming authors and publishers. The decision will likely be appealed, of course, but it is an important win for our access to our shared cultural heritage. Australia is currently going through a copyright reform process. It seems probable that the Australian Law Reform Commission will recommend that Australia introduce fair use, in order to increase public access and opportunities for innovation. If the government is serious about encouraging private innovation, this reform is crucially important. Otherwise, Australia will continue to watch as innovation happens elsewhere, in countries that have more sensible and balanced laws.
