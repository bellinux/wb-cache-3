5|$|London Wildlife Trust (LWT), {{founded in}} 1981, {{is the local}} <b>nature</b> <b>conservation</b> charity for Greater London. It is one of 47 members of the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts (known as The Wildlife Trusts), {{each of which is}} a local <b>nature</b> <b>conservation</b> charity for its area. The Trust aims to protect London's {{wildlife}} and wild spaces, and it manages over 40 nature reserves in Greater London. One of its campaigns is to turn London's gardens into mini-nature reserves, and it provides education services for schools. Local groups work on reserves and organise walks.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of {{the natural}} {{environment}} is well developed in the United Kingdom. There are various public sector organisations with {{an important role in}} the stewardship of the country's flora. Scottish Natural Heritage is the statutory body responsible for natural heritage management in Scotland. One of their duties is to establish National Nature Reserves. Until 2004 there were 73, but a review carried out in that year resulted in a significant number of sites losing their NNR status, and as of 2006 there are 55. The Forestry Commission in Scotland serves as the forestry department of the Scottish Government and is one of the country's largest landowners. The Joint <b>Nature</b> <b>Conservation</b> Committee is the statutory adviser to Government on UK and international <b>nature</b> <b>conservation.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1981, {{the site}} was {{proposed}} for commercial development, provoking an energetic campaign by the Chiswick Wildlife Group, formed in March 1982, which became the local branch of the London Wildlife Trust. The threat to {{the site was}} one of the first to be highlighted by the London Wildlife Trust on its formation in October 1981. The campaign led to a Public Inquiry in July 1983, which determined that the site should be devoted to <b>nature</b> <b>conservation.</b> This was the first time anywhere in the United Kingdom that a Public Inquiry had ruled in favour of nature in a city, and the Gunnersbury Triangle example became a test case.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} of rapid {{economic}} growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed {{by the government and}} industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern about the problem, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, <b>nature</b> <b>conservation,</b> climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.|$|E

5|$|Many ragstone {{quarries}} {{have been}} abandoned and backfilled once exhausted. When Ditton Quarry closed down in 1984, quarrying operations had left behind a legacy of a lime-rich soil which formed {{the foundation of a}} thriving habitat for plants and wildlife; 140 wild flowers (including five that are rare in Kent), 18 butterfly species, and 50 bird species have been recorded. It is also home to foxes, rabbits, frogs, toads and newts. The quarry is now a Site of <b>Nature</b> <b>Conservation</b> Importance (SNCI). Public access is free.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{was partly}} {{demolished}} {{just after the}} war on Churchill's direct orders (and to the great annoyance of the French, who were not consulted), as it was still seen {{as a threat to}} the United Kingdom. It was later reopened by private owners, first in 1969 to serve as a mushroom farm and subsequently as a museum in 1984. A <b>nature</b> <b>conservation</b> organisation acquired the Fortress of Mimoyecques in 2010 and La Coupole, a former V-2 rocket base turned museum near Saint-Omer, took over its management. It continues to be open to the public as a vast underground museum complex.|$|E

In 1987 it changed its name to the Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust. In 2007 it purchased Amwell Quarry, and started restoration which has now made the site internationally important for its wetland birds.|$|E

40|$|Nature {{is often}} anthropomorphized in the {{environmental}} discourse. However, whether anthropomorphism of nature has any impact on the way people relate to and behave toward nature has rarely been examined. With three experiments, the present research addresses this issue. It shows that in general anthropomorphism of <b>nature</b> fosters <b>conservation</b> behavior. Moreover, when nature is anthropomorphized, people feel more connected to it; this sense of connectedness mediates the association between anthropomorphism of <b>nature</b> and <b>conservation</b> behavior. These findings contribute {{to the understanding of}} anthropomorphism and that of human-nature relationship. They also bear practical implications for environmental promotion.
