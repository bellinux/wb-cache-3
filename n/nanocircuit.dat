5000|$|The {{last part}} of <b>nanocircuit</b> {{organization}} is architecture. This has been explained as the overall way the transistors are interconnected, so that the circuit can plug into a computer or other system and operate independently of the lower-level details. [...] With nanocircuits being so small, they are destined for error and defects. Scientists have devised {{a way to get}} around this. Their architecture combines circuits that have redundant logic gates and interconnections with the ability to reconfigure structures at several levels on a chip. [...] The redundancy lets the circuit identify problems and reconfigure itself so the circuit can avoid more problems. It also allows for errors within the logic gate and still have it work properly without giving a wrong result.|$|E
50|$|The second {{aspect of}} <b>nanocircuit</b> {{organization}} is interconnection. This involves logical and mathematical operations and the wires linking the transistors together {{that make this}} possible. In nanocircuits, nanotubes and other wires as narrow as one nanometer are used to link transistors together. Nanowires have been made from carbon nanotubes for a few years. Until a few years ago, transistors and nanowires were put together to produce the circuit. However, scientists {{have been able to}} produce a nanowire with transistors in it. In 2004, Harvard University nanotech pioneer Charles Lieber and his team have made a nanowire—10,000 times thinner than a sheet of paper—that contains a string of transistors. Essentially, transistors and nanowires are already pre-wired so as to eliminate the difficult task of trying to connect transistors together with nanowires.|$|E
5000|$|Arguably {{the biggest}} {{potential}} application of nanocircuits deals with computers and electronics. Scientists and engineers {{are always looking}} to make computers faster. Some think in the nearer term, we could see hybrids of micro- and nano-: silicon with a nano core—perhaps a high-density computer memory that retains its contents forever. [...] Unlike conventional circuit design, which proceeds from blueprint to photographic pattern to chip, <b>nanocircuit</b> design will probably begin with the chip—a haphazard jumble {{of as many as}} 1024 components and wires, not all of which will even work—and gradually sculpt it into a useful device. [...] Instead of taking the traditional top-down approach, the bottom-up approach will probably soon have to be adopted because of the sheer size of these nanocircuits. Not everything in the circuit will probably work because at the nano level, nanocircuits will be more defective and faulty because of their compactness. Scientists and engineers have created all of the essential components of nanocircuits such as transistors, logic gates and diodes. They have all been constructed from organic molecules, carbon nanotubes and nanowire semiconductors. The only thing left to do is find a way to eliminate the errors that come with such a small device and nanocircuits will become a way of all electronics. However, eventually there will be a limit as to how small nanocircuits can become and computers and electronics will reach their equilibrium speeds.|$|E

This allows faster and more complex functions using less power. <b>Nanocircuits</b> are composed of three different fundamental components.

The use of phase-shaped pulses or beams enforces specific requirements for on-chip integration and imposes strict design limitations. We introduce here an alternative approach, which is based on exploiting the strong sub-wavelength spatial phase modulation in the near-field of resonantly-excited high-Q optical microcavities integrated into plasmonic <b>nanocircuits.</b> Our theoretical analysis reveals the formation of areas of circulating powerflow (optical vortices) in the near-fields of optical microcavities, whose positions and mutual coupling can be controlled by tuning the microcavities parameters and the excitation wavelength. We show that optical powerflow though nanoscale plasmonic structures can be dynamically molded by engineering interactions of microcavity-induced optical vortices with noble-metal nanoparticles. The proposed strategy of re-configuring plasmonic <b>nanocircuits</b> via locally-addressable photonic elements opens the way to develop chip-integrated optoplasmonic switching architectures, which is crucial for implementation of quantum information <b>nanocircuits.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

While energy transfer is efficiently utilized by living systems, its adoption to connect individual components in man-made plasmonic <b>nanocircuits</b> {{has been challenged}} by low transfer efficiencies that motivate the development of entirely new concepts for energy transfer. We introduce herein optoplasmonic superlenses that combine the capability of optical microcavities to insulate molecule-photon systems from decohering environmental effects with the superior light nanoconcentration properties of nanoantennas. The proposed structures provide significant enhancement of the emitter radiative rate and efficient long-range transfer of emitted photons followed by subsequent refocusing into nanoscale volumes accessible to near- and far-field detection. Optoplasmonic superlenses are versatile building blocks for optoplasmonic <b>nanocircuits</b> {{and can be used}} to construct “dark” single-molecule sensors, resonant amplifiers, nanoconcentrators, frequency multiplexers, demultiplexers, energy converters, and dynamical switches...|$|R
