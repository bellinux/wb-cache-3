40|$|The paper {{answers the}} {{following}} questions: whether infrastructure sharing policy {{been able to}} achieve its core objective of preventing <b>network</b> <b>tower</b> investment duplication in single locations? And whether pricing strategy employed by tower owners encourage sharing? The foundation of these issues is concerned with the structure of costs for providing sharing services, the nature of contracts or other conditions for commercialization, and the clash of different buyers (MNOs) of towers spaces. The implications for the diffusion of telecom infrastructure and services to poorly covered areas of these market conditions and the conduct of the market players constitute the primary focus of this research. For assessing the market structure, the behavior of market players, and the outcome of the sharing policy, a Structure-Conduct-Performance (SCP) framework is applied. A combination of qualitative and quantitative data were collected including ten (10) employees of the network companies, tower companies, internet service vendors and the regulatory agency (NCA) for interviews and reports on 2000 out of 5750 co-location tower sites (at the beginning of 2016) across the country were analyzed. Against the expectations of the regulator, infrastructure sharing is currently not effective. For rural communities, rather than sharing amidst non-pleasant market conduct from the incumbent operators, new entrant operators have chosen to build their own towers, holding back diffusion due to single cost ownership and also defeating the purpose of infrastructure sharing policy. Factors such as market size of firms and their degree of concentration will continue to affect conduct and performance, unless there is a strong institutional incentive for undertaking mandatory access strategies to challenge dominance to induce greater competition in markets...|$|E

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2012. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 51). Robi Axiata Limited {{is one of the}} leading multinational organizations and a big player in telecommunication industry of Bangladesh. Robi started its business in 1997 with a brand name Aktel and it was changed to Robi in 1997. It is a joint venture company of Axiata Limited (70 %), Malaysia and NTT DoCoMo, Japan. I was employed in this leading MNC of Bangladesh for three months for the purpose of Advertisement and Promotional activities data analysis. I was employed in Business Partner unit under Finance Division. My team name was sales and promotion. Its task is to deal with the vendors involved with Robi for advertisement and promotional activity purpose. The great thing to work is Robi is that I have learned many things regarding the role of Robi Axiata Limited in telecom industry of Bangladesh. There are two things that are considered to identify the role of any cellular operator in Bangladesh. One is Product and VAS quality and network quality. First of all it is important to know the condition of the industry. In Bangladesh there are three major competitors in telecom industry. Those are Grameenphone (Market Leader), Robi and Banglalink. These three are controlling ninety percent of the total market share where Grameenphone is in the first position regarding market share. Banglalink and Robi are in second and third position. In terms of Grameenphone, Robi and Banglalink is in first, second and third position. However if we see the update regarding number of subscriber increase for the month of August, 2012 by BTCL, Robi is in first position and they are almost double ahead than the market leader Grameenphone. It has been possible because they have the strength in the side of low call rate, network quality and better product and services. However Grameenphone has a problem of high call rate. That may cost the position of market leader for Grameenphone with in 5 or 6 years and Robi can be a great threat for them. Banglalink and Robi call rate is almost same but the network quality of Robi is far better than Banglalink. For that reason active user of Robi is higher than Banglalink. So they need to improve a lot regarding network quality if they want to alive in the competition. The other three such as Airtel, Citycell and Teletalk needs to improve a lot regarding management, employee, call rate and network quality if they want to give a real competition to Grameenphone, Robi and Banglalink. Robi offers variety of products under its prepaid and postpaid categories. By analyzing the product and services it has been found that maximum subscribers are in prepaid category. The main reasons are the product variety under prepaid category, package shifting advantage (only Robi provides it), no bill payment problem, call rate and more bonus facilities. Robi also offers variety of unique VASs for its subscribers like Ibadot portal, Robi Jibon Bima, BBC Janala and DJ & Party schedule etc. Robi has a strong cellular network base in Bangladesh. They are covering in 61 districts out of 64 of the whole country. It indicates 95 percent of the whole nation equally highest with Grameenphone. So they have the capacity to provide service to the highest number of people in Bangladesh. Robi has the most high-tech European based GSM technology. To ensure the network strength for its subscribers, Robi has engaged more than 18, 600 <b>network</b> <b>tower</b> all over the country. If Robi continue its Role this way, soon they will be the market leader. Md. Saleh-Ibne-RashidB. Business Administratio...|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of transport and diffusion of airborne pollutants during the nighttime is challenging, especially over complex terrain where gravity driven drainage flows may be overlain with wind {{from a different}} direction. This study investigates the character of wind direction shear in the lowest 100 m using tower measurements from a complex, semi-arid site where local thermally-driven flows are common. the effects of wind direction shear on plume transport are studied by simulating a hypothetical elevated term release. This is accomplished by first simulating transport and dispersion using wind measurements from only the 12 -m level from a <b>network</b> of <b>towers.</b> This case represents the approach commonly taken at many facilities where a <b>network</b> of short <b>towers</b> is available. Then the release is modeled using wind measurements made at four levels in the lowest 100 m.

25|$|In {{respect to}} the other {{non-lethal}} weapon effects from an IND detonated {{on or near the}} surface, the detonation's blast wave would likely produce a momentary electric grid blackout due to the loss of a large portion of a city's electrical equipment drawing power/electrical load, while the electromagnetic pulse(EMP) from a surface/ground-burst explosion would cause little damage outside the blast area, so cell phone towers that survive the blast should be capable of carrying communications. Although if communications during the 9/11 attacks or after a major hurricane are anything to go by, and the cell phone <b>network</b> <b>towers</b> survive, the service would be overloaded(a Mass call event) and thereby made useless soon after; however, if prior arrangements between the cell network and emergency responders are made to give them priority and bar access to all other individuals, then it may be an effective service. However, as Civil defense(CD) shelters, as depicted in the film, were stocked for such an eventuality, they contained amongst other things, at least one CDV-715 radiation survey meter and a CD emergency radio receiver which would respectively be used to facilitate a safe delayed evacuation, regardless of outside help and if communications continued, inform them of the outside situation as it developed.|$|R
