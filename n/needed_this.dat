5|$|A {{number of}} ad hoc {{meetings}} of Heads of State or Government of the Euro area countries {{were held in}} 2010 and 2011 to discuss the Sovereign Debt crisis. It was agreed in October 2011 that they should meet regularly twice a year (with extra meetings if <b>needed).</b> <b>This</b> will normally be {{at the end of}} a European Council meeting and according to the same format (chaired by the President of the European Council and including the President of the Commission), but usually restricted to the (currently 19) Heads of State or Government of countries whose currency is the euro.|$|E
5|$|Maria Komnene {{conducted}} the negotiations for {{the marriage of}} Alice to Hugh I of Cyprus, Aimery of Lusignan's eldest surviving son and successor, {{in accordance with the}} agreement their fathers had reached. Since the marriage of Alice's mother and Hugh I's father made them step-sister and step-brother, a special dispensation was <b>needed.</b> <b>This</b> was granted by Pope Innocent III. Blanche of Navarre supplied Alice's dowry as she sought to ensure that Alice would stay in Cyprus rather than attempting to lay claim to Champagne and Brie. To strengthen her son's position, Blanche also persuaded Philip II of France in 1209 to promise that he would not allow anyone to challenge Theobald IV's right to the two counties before Theobald reached the age of majority.|$|E

5|$|The Provisional Government also {{included}} a judiciary. The forerunner of the Oregon Supreme Court consisted of a single Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace. The Supreme Judge was elected by the people, but the legislature could select someone as presiding judge as a replacement if <b>needed.</b> <b>This</b> Supreme Court had original and appellate jurisdiction over legal matters, whereas the lower probate court and justice courts that were also created could only hear original jurisdictional matters when the amount in controversy was less than $50 and did not involve land disputes. Some judges under the Provisional Government were Nathaniel Ford, Peter H. Burnett, Osborne Russell, Ira L. Babcock, and future United States Senator James W. Nesmith.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Supercruise requirements called for prolonged supersonic flight {{without the use of}} afterburners. Northrop drew on its experience with the B-2 Spirit and F/A-18 Hornet to reduce the model's susceptibility to radar and infrared detection. The USAF initially required the aircraft to land and stop within , which meant the use of thrust reversers on their engines. In 1987, the USAF changed the runway length requirement to , so thrust reversers were no longer <b>needed.</b> <b>This</b> allowed the aircraft to have smaller engine nacelle housings. The nacelles were not downsized on the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{success of}} Kagemusha allowed Kurosawa {{to proceed with}} his next project, Ran, another epic in a similar vein. The script, partly based on William Shakespeare's King Lear, depicted a ruthless, bloodthirsty daimyō (warlord), played by Tatsuya Nakadai, who, after foolishly banishing his one loyal son, surrenders his kingdom to his other two sons, who then betray him, thus plunging the entire kingdom into war. As Japanese studios still felt wary about producing another film that would rank among the most expensive ever made in the country, international help was again <b>needed.</b> <b>This</b> time it came from French producer Serge Silberman, who had produced Luis Buñuel's final movies. Filming did not begin until December 1983 and lasted more than a year.|$|E

5|$|The prior era saw great {{military}} successes, {{and great}} economic failures, while the patriotism of the Plebeians had {{kept them from}} seeking any new reforms. Now, however, the military situation had stabilized, and fewer soldiers were <b>needed.</b> <b>This,</b> {{in conjunction with the}} new slaves that were being imported from abroad, inflamed the unemployment situation further.

5|$|Euan MacKie has {{supported}} Thom's analysis, {{to which he}} added an archaeological context by comparing Neolithic Britain to the Mayan civilization to argue for a stratified society in this period. To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. Kintraw is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed {{that this was a}} foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on Jura. This, Thom argued, was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was <b>needed.</b> <b>This</b> was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at Maes Howe and on the Bush Barrow Lozenge led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.|$|E
5|$|The Globular Amphora {{culture was}} the next major Neolithic culture. It {{originated}} in the Polish lowlands {{during the first half}} of 4th millennium BC, lasted to about 2400 BCE in parallel with the Funnelbeaker culture, and is named after the bulging shape of its representative pottery. They specialized in breeding domestic animals and lived in a semi-settled state, seeking optimal pastures and moving as <b>needed.</b> <b>This</b> semi-nomadic lifestyle was probably necessitated by the poor condition of the soils, by that time depleted and rendered infertile because of the preceding centuries of forest burning and extensive exploitation. Globular Amphora were the first culture in Poland known for utilizing the domesticated horse, and swine became important as the source of food. Ritual animal, especially cattle burial sites, often with two or more individuals buried together and supplied with objects as strange as drums have been discovered, but their role is not well understood. Globular Amphora people were involved in the north-south amber trade. Their megalithic burials included ceramics, stone tools and ornamental gifts.|$|E
