5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique to African American Vernacular English, although {{it can be found}} in some dialects of Caribbean English as well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral <b>negator</b> (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin may have been due to approximation when early African Americans acquired English as a second language; {{it is also possible that}} early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not or does not.|$|E

2500|$|Modal notions are {{expressed}} by further periphrastic constructions. A verb with the -kama suffix {{may be used}} in an independent clause to convey obligation: Tiiskiba umling taakkama skuul ki [...] "All the children must go to school". Ikar is used as a modal auxiliary of volition, as in Nah rama kuup larn tang ikri [...] "I want to learn Rama" [...] (larn tang [...] "learn"). Ability may be expressed by the future/irrealis tense form in -ut, e.g. Maa kalma apaakut? [...] "Will/can you sew a dress?" [...] Inability is expressed by the <b>negator</b> angka preceding the complete verb, e.g. Nah rama kuup angka alkwsi [...] "I cannot speak Rama".|$|E

2500|$|The {{hypothesis}} that Greek is Armenian's closest living relative originates with Holger Pedersen (1924), who {{noted that the}} number of Greek-Armenian lexical cognates is greater than that of agreements between Armenian and any other Indo-European language. Antoine Meillet (1925, 1927) further investigated morphological and phonological agreement, postulating that the parent languages of Greek and Armenian were dialects in immediate geographical proximity in the Proto-Indo-European period. Meillet's hypothesis became popular {{in the wake of his}} Esquisse (1936). Georg Renatus Solta (1960) does not go as far as postulating a Proto-Graeco-Armenian stage, but he concludes that considering both the lexicon and morphology, Greek is clearly the dialect most closely related to Armenian. Eric P. Hamp (1976, 91) supports the Graeco-Armenian thesis, anticipating even a time [...] "when we should speak of Helleno-Armenian" [...] (meaning the postulate of a Graeco-Armenian proto-language). Armenian shares the augment, and a <b>negator</b> derived from the set phrase Proto-Indo-European language [...] ("never anything" [...] or [...] "always nothing"), and the representation of word-initial laryngeals by prothetic vowels, and other phonological and morphological peculiarities with Greek. Nevertheless, as Fortson (2004) comments, [...] "by the time we reach our earliest Armenian records in the 5th century AD, the evidence of any such early kinship has been reduced to a few tantalizing pieces".|$|E
5000|$|In coverb constructions, the <b>negator</b> {{may come}} before the coverb (preposition) or before the full verb, the latter being more emphatic. In constructions with a passive marker, the <b>negator</b> precedes that marker; similarly, in {{comparative}} constructions, the <b>negator</b> precedes the bǐ phrase (unless the verb is further qualified by 更 gèng [...] "even more", {{in which case the}} <b>negator</b> may follow the gèng to produce the meaning [...] "even less").|$|E
5000|$|A clause is negated {{by placing}} <b>negator</b> nanɛ or nɛnɛ after the predicate. Besides nanɛ {{there are two}} {{negative}} particles: ʔɛ and haʔai. ʔɛ is used to limit the scope of <b>negator</b> nanɛ by placing ʔɛ {{in front of the}} negated element. In this case nanɛ must still succeed the predicate: ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} bimorphemic syllables {{appeared}} in the Classical period, resulting from the fusion of words with following unstressed particles or pronouns.Thus the negatives [...] and [...] are viewed as fusions of the <b>negators</b> [...] and [...] respectively with a third-person pronoun [...]|$|R
5000|$|Proto-Indo-European {{particles}} {{could be}} used both as adverbs and postpositions, like [...] "under, below". The postpositions became prepositions in most daughter languages. Other reconstructible particles include <b>negators</b> (...) , conjunctions ( [...] "and", [...] "or" [...] and others) and an interjection ( [...] , an expression of woe or agony).|$|R
50|$|Different {{varieties}} {{have different}} negative markers. This is so prominent that speakers identify Kurripako dialects {{according to the}} words for yes and no. The independent negative markers come before the verb. They are used as clausal <b>negators</b> in declarative and interrogative sentences. They are also used to link clauses.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>negator</b> kan {{typically}} {{precedes the}} verb: kan kemeːwanon, [...] "it is not raining". The <b>negator</b> also inflects for certain elements of modal inflection: kasaq kemeːwanon, [...] "why, it isnt raining anymore!" [...] It {{can be used}} alone to answer a yes-no question. The particle poːn is used to negate imperatives: poːn kasɛːhkehseh, [...] "dont be too late".|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} Berber varieties, the Figuig Berber dialects use bipartite verbal negation. The preverbal <b>negator</b> is ul (locally un, il); the postverbal <b>negator</b> is ša (Igli, Mazzer) / šay (Figuig, Iche, Moghrar) / iš (Boussemghoun, Ain Chair), {{with both the}} latter two {{appearing}} as allomorphs in Tiout. The numerals 1-2 are Berber, while higher numerals are Arabic borrowings throughout.|$|E
30|$|None of the <b>negators</b> and intensifiers is {{included}} in the sentiment lexicon. Consequently, if they appear in a sentence surrounded by only neutral text, they are considered as neutral words. However, if they appear in a neighbourhood of positive or negative words they are considered as non-neutral given that they influence the final sentiment of a sentence.|$|R
40|$|Based on cross-linguistic {{data and}} the postulation of six {{language}} types, the Negative Existential Cycle was proposed by Croft (1991) {{as a way of}} modeling the evolution of standard negation markers from existential <b>negators.</b> The current investigation tests this model by applying it to two language families, Slavonic and Polynesian, checking which cycle types are instantiated in these families and outlining pathways of transition between different types. In Slavonic, we observe one type without variation and two types with internal variation. All cycle types are instantiated in Polynesian, which is correlated with characteristics specific to this family. Three pathways are outlined for the partial or complete transfer of negative existentials into the verbal domain. The first is contingent on negative existentials being used in specific constructions and the direct inheritance or expansion of use of these constructions; the second involves negative existentials being used as emphatic <b>negators</b> external to the proposition and their subsequent reanalysis as clause internal <b>negators</b> without any additional pragmatic content. The third pathway, observed in Polynesian only, is through subordination processes leading to the re-interpretation of negative existentials as general markers of negation. Additionally, a time dimension needs to be added when modeling this cycle, as its completion, i. e. the negative existential turning into a full-fledged marker of standard negation, appears to take longer than 2, 000 years.

50|$|Polar {{questions}} are commonly formed in three ways. A declarative clause with {{a rise in}} intonation to mark the interrogative which requires the binary, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response, much {{as they are in}} English may be used. The second alternative is the addition of the verbal <b>negator</b> (o) siai ‘(or) not’ and the third is the addition of verbal <b>negator</b> sikiai (not yet) if the interrogative has a temporal element.|$|E

40|$|<b>Negators,</b> modals, {{and degree}} adverbs can {{significantly}} affect the sentiment {{of the words}} they modify. Often, their impact is modeled with simple heuristics; although, recent work has shown that such heuristics do not capture the true sentiment of multi-word phrases. We created a dataset of phrases that include various <b>negators,</b> modals, and degree adverbs, {{as well as their}} combinations. Both the phrases and their constituent content words were annotated with real-valued scores of sentiment association. Using phrasal terms in the created dataset, we analyze the impact of individual modifiers and the average effect of the groups of modifiers on overall sentiment. We find that the effect of modifiers varies substantially among the members of the same group. Furthermore, each individual modifier can affect sentiment words in different ways. Therefore, solutions based on statistical learning seem more promising than fixed hand-crafted rules on the task of automatic sentiment prediction.
