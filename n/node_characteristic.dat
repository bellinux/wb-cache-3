40|$|In recent years, {{collaborative}} research between academia and industry has intensified {{in finding a}} successful approach to take the information from a computer generated drawings of products such as casting dies, and produce optimal manufacturing process plans. Core to this process is feature recognition. Artificial neural networks have a proven track record in pattern recognition and there ability to learn seems to offer an approach to aid both feature recognition and process planning tasks. This paper presents an up-to-date critical study of the implementation of artificial neural networks (ANN) applied to feature recognition and computer aided process planning. In providing this comprehensive survey, the authors consider the factors which define the function of a neural network specifically: the net topology, the input <b>node</b> <b>characteristic,</b> the learning rules and the output node characteristics.

40|$|Abstract- Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is {{emerging}} {{as one of the}} most important branches of cloud computing. In MCC, a group of mobile devices connected via WLAN and cooperating to execute the user’s jobs and acting as a computing resource provider. However, unlike could computing (which use a powerful servers to execute the jobs), mobile devices are not reliable to execute extensive jobs in the MCC due to its limitation of battery and connectivity. To overcome this limitation and keep the execution of the job up and running even if the mobile device leave the cloud, we need to reschedule the job and continue the execution on another available mobile device in the MCC. Firstly, the impact of job and <b>node</b> <b>characteristic</b> on the performance of the MCC will be discussed. Secondly, we introduce a new scheduling techniques used by the scheduling manager component in the MCC. At last, evaluate and compares our approach with similar approaches. All of these may contribute to make the MCC more efficient, reliable and feasible to be used as a powerful cloud platform to execute the user’s extensive jobs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{recursive}} estimation method of <b>node</b> <b>characteristics</b> called RENC (Recursive Estimation of <b>Node</b> <b>Characteristics)</b> using the topological {{structure of a}} complex networks. RENC reduces the effect of noise by recursively estimating <b>node</b> <b>characteristics</b> using the topological structure of a network. In this paper, we also propose a network generation model called LRE (Linkage with Relative Evaluation). The network generation model LRE is for simulating a social network, in which every node is likely to make decision based on relative evaluation, {{so that it can}} reproduce several characteristics of a social network. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of our recursive estimation method RENC by applying RENC to several networks generated with LRE. Consequently, we show that the estimation accuracy of <b>node</b> <b>characteristics</b> can be improved by using our recursive estimation method RENC. I...|$|R

40|$|Of {{clinical}} {{interest are}} methods and tools to differentiate and localize epileptic foci, for surgical (and possibly {{other forms of}} intervention in the future) intervention. Previously, high frequency events, ripples (80 - 200 Hz) and fast ripples (200 - 500 Hz), were identified from both in vitro and in vivo recordings of epileptic foci tissue [1], but results were limited in that the data acquired was from single electrodes, and so simultaneous recordings of network activity were not obtained, and thus network dynamics within such regions were not analyzed. Using a 10 x 10 grid Utah array electrodes for recording from focal epileptic and control slices of human tissue (control tissue being non-epileptic cortical tissue excised during extraction of a sub-cortical tumor or focus area), {{we are able to}} probe the network microstructure and, more critically, how these networks (epileptic focus and control) differ from each other. For analysis, we used standard low-frequency bands (theta, delta, alpha, gamma) as well as higher frequency bands (80 - 200 Hz, 200 - 500 Hz) for characteristic signals differentiating the epileptic and control populations. The raw data was filtered at these separate bands and networks were extracted from the filtered data using phase synchronization and cross-correlation as a means to detect phase and amplitude signal similarities, respectively. Once the networks were extracted, we could examine different network measures to determine if network properties were statistically different or not. We measured small-worldness characteristics such as the Clustering Coefficient (which measures how similar a reference node’s neighbour’s connectivity are to the reference <b>node),</b> <b>Characteristic</b> Path Length (which measures how many connections it takes on average to get from any one node to any other node in the network), degree (number of connections each node has), % change of network volatility, Small Worldness coefficien...|$|E

Examining different sets of <b>node</b> <b>characteristics</b> thus may reveal interesting communities or other structural properties of the network.

40|$|The {{friendship}} paradox {{states that}} your friends have on average more friends than you have. Does the paradox "hold" for other individual characteristics like income or happiness? To address this question, we generalize the friendship paradox for arbitrary <b>node</b> <b>characteristics</b> in complex networks. By analyzing two coauthorship networks of Physical Review journals and Google Scholar profiles, {{we find that}} the generalized friendship paradox (GFP) holds at the individual and network levels for various characteristics, including the number of coauthors, the number of citations, and the number of publications. The origin of the GFP is shown to be rooted in positive correlations between degree and characteristics. As a fruitful application of the GFP, we suggest effective and efficient sampling methods for identifying high <b>characteristic</b> <b>nodes</b> in large-scale networks.

For the composers’ periods we have r= 0.257 ± 0.005, meaning that composers belonging to a common period tend to be connected preferentially to one another. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) between connected composers’ active years (the middle point between their birth and death years) is even higher, with 0.451 ± 0.009.|$|R

Despite this diversity, we demonstrate here that a statistical model decomposing networks into matching and centrality components provides a comprehensive and unifying quantification of their architecture.

Consequently, the model allows very accurate prediction of missing links in partially known networks. Second, when <b>node</b> <b>characteristics</b> are known, we show how the matching-centrality decomposition can be related to this external information.

40|$|Abstract—Clustering {{algorithms}} improve network manage-ability {{through several}} topology partitioning techniques. In some particular cases, such as vehicular ad hoc network (VANETs) communications, significant performance improvements can be introduced via clustered networking solutions whereas merging clusters {{for the sake}} of scalability may lead to degraded network stability. In this paper, we explore the impact of merging clusters, and furthermore based on these results, we propose a new clustering technique, namely Relatively Stable Clustering for Unbiased Environments (ReSCUE). The objective of ReSCUE is primarily guaranteeing cluster stability in an unbiased manner. ReSCUE keeps track of the spatio-temporal changes in VANET <b>node</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and uses these characteristics along with local information to prevent biased clustering which is based on common and general <b>node</b> <b>characteristics.</b> We evaluate the performance of ReSCUE through simulations and show that ReSCUE can form relatively more stable clusters while reducing the frequency of cluster merges, {{as well as that of}} the node status changes.
