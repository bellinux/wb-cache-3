40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Steric stabilisers were synthesised via the copolymerisation of styrene with acrylic macromonomers. The macromonomers were prepared by end capping reactions of poly 2 -ethyl hexyl acrylate (PEHA) prepolymer with vinyl containing species. Preliminary reaction routes proceeded via the use of oxalyl chloride to create an acyl chloride intermediate followed by end capping with hydroxy ethyl methacrylate. This process {{was found to be}} inefficient due to the moisture sensitivity of the acyl chloride. The second route involved the direct end capping of the PEHA pre-polymer with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA). Macromonomer conversion levels were improved for the GMA route via the use of high temperatures and tertiary amine catalysts. An optimum set of conditions was achieved using 1. 4 diazabicyclo [2. 2. 2. ] octane as the catalyst and a reaction temperature of 160 QC. <b>Non</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersion</b> polymerisations of methyl methacrylate were performed. The factors affecting particle size in both single stage and twin stage polymerisation schemes were studied. Increases in the particle sizes of these dispersions were observed with increases in the total monomer concentration and also with decreases in the total stabiliser concentration. Increases in the particle size could also be achieved by increasing the proportion of the total monomer in the seed stage of the twin stage reaction and also by decreasing the proportion of the total stabiliser in the seed stage. The importance {{of the role of the}} seed upon the final particle size was firmly established. The rheology of these non aqueous dispersions was studied over a range of concentrations and under increasing shear stresses. At Iow and intennediate volume fractions the dispersions were observed to be predominantly Newtonian. Non-Newtonian behaviour was only observed at the extremes of the shear stress ranges studied. At high volume fractions of the dispersions non-Newtonian behaviour was observed over the range of shear stresses studied. Maximum volume fractions (m) were calculated for these dispersions using the Kreiger-Dougherty equation. When these dispersions were blended in size ratios of 2 : 1 it was observed that 4 >m could be increased due to improved particle packing efficiency...|$|E

The particle size of all these PUU (DPU) <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersions</b> (&#x 003 C; 100 nm) was {{less than that of}} comparable specimens, that is, poly-(neopentyl glycol adipate) polyester-polyol-based PUU (APU) <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersions,</b> and the polydispersity index was very narrow (&#x 2264; 1. 13). The films prepared with the DPU <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersions</b> exhibited excellent waterproof performance, such as low amount of water absorption (1. 3 wt%), and good mechanical properties (hardness and tensile strength), resulting from the strong hydrogen bonding in urea carbonyl groups and the perfect ordered structure of hard segments compared with those prepared with the APU <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersions.</b> The surface hydrophobicity of the films prepared with modified DPU <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersions,</b> which were modified with a fluorinated polyacrylate emulsion, was excellent, as the water contact angle on the surface of such films rose up to 100.

40|$|Static {{dispersion}} polymerization of styrene, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, {{butyl methacrylate}} and benzyl methacrylate, initiated by a lipophilic initiator in an <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersion</b> with unmodified silica particles was investigated. Polymerization of styrene gave a mixed dispersion of silica and monodisperse polystyrene (PS) particles, which was extremely stable {{compared with the}} <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersion</b> of silica particles. The enhanced dispersion stability {{is due to a}} thixotropic effect based on weak attractive interparticle interactions between silica and PS particles in <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersion.</b> An aggregate in which silica particles are surrounded by the smaller PS particles is formed and inhibits flocculation of silica particles, thus giving enhanced dispersion stability. The results of similar static polymerization reactions with methacrylate analogs indicate that hydrogen bonds between benzene ring and hydroxy groups on the silica surface, and not electrostatic interaction derived from initiator residues, are the origin of weak interaction for thixotropic aggregation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{conversion}} of <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersion</b> of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) into dry powder by spray drying {{could be a}} useful approach to render NLCs with better physical chemical stability than the <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersion.</b> In this study, <b>aqueous</b> NLC <b>dispersion</b> containing fenofibrate was converted into dry, easily reconstitutable powder using spray drying. A central composite face centered design (CCFD) was used to investigate {{the influence of the}} ratio of lipid to protectant (mannitol and trehalose) and crystallinity of spray-dried powder on the particle size, yield and residual moisture content of the dried powder. A linear relationship (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 9915) was established between the crystalline content of the spray-dried powders against the ratio of mannitol to trehalose from 3 : 7 to 10 : 0 (w/w). Spray drying of NLC <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersion</b> using a mannitol and trehalose mixture resulted in an increase in particle size of the NLCs after reconstitution in water as compared to that in the initial <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersion.</b> The decrease in crystallinity of the dry powder by reducing the ratio of mannitol to trehalose could improve the reconstitution of the NLCs in water. However the yield and residual moisture content of dry powder decreased with an increase in the ratio of mannitol to trehalose. Lipid nanoparticles were able to retain the drug incorporation and the prolonged drug release profile after spray drying. The experimental model was robust, and suggested that spray drying is a viable technique for the {{conversion of}} NLCs into dry powder...|$|R

Although the SAXS profiles exhibited a weak peak and the auto-correlation functions of DLS showed a log-time decay by the “repulsive cage effect” due to the long-ranged electrostatic interaction among PFSI particles, the concentration dependence of SLS results was probably normal because the cancellation of the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.
