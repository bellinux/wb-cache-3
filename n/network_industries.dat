5|$|Television in Croatia {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1956. As of 2012 there are 10 nationwide and 21 regional DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcasting – Terrestrial) television channels, and more than 30 other channels either produced in the Republic of Croatia or produced for the Croatian market and broadcast via IPTV (Internet Protocol television), cable or satellite television. The electronic communications market in Croatia is regulated by the Croatian Regulatory Authority for <b>Network</b> <b>Industries</b> (HAKOM), which issues broadcast licenses and monitors the market. The DVB-T and satellite transmission infrastructure is developed and maintained by the state-owned company Odašiljači i veze (OiV).|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} industry in Croatia is {{regulated by the}} Croatian Regulatory Authority for <b>Network</b> <b>Industries</b> (HAKOM). HAKOM was established by the Electronic Communications Act of 26 June 2008; pursuant to Article 5 of the act, HAKOM is tasked with promoting and safeguarding market competition {{and the interests of}} service users in the field of electronic communication services and infrastructure, while contributing {{to the development of the}} internal market of the European Union. HAKOM's goals include ensuring sustainable development of the electronic communications market at affordable prices for consumers, providing fair conditions for return on investment in the market and contributing to the quality of life in Croatia. Further regulation of the television is performed by the Electronic Media Council, which enacts mandatory regulation applying to both state-run and privately owned broadcasters based in Croatia. One such regulation, aimed at protection of minors, restricts depictions of violence, sexual intercourse, profanity, use of intoxicating substances and tobacco and other scenes which may be harmful to development of minors between seven in the morning and nine, ten or eleven in the evening, depending on rating of specific programmeadvising that the programme is not suitable for persons under 12, 15 or 18 years of age respectively. The restriction does not apply to educational, documentary, science or news programming.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we reconsidered several pricing {{policies}} in the <b>network</b> <b>industry</b> and compared the advantages of some (five) policies on other policies from point of views of the monopoly who considers profit maximization The uniqueness of the <b>network</b> <b>industry</b> is that the demands for services include at least two parties, the sender of a message and the receiver of the message. These demands that are not necessarily symmetric can be estimated very accurately using nowadays technologies like RFID etc. by seller of the network services. Knowing the accurate demands the optimal pricing can be determined...|$|R
25|$|There are no {{autonomous}} {{regulatory agencies}} {{for water and}} sanitation in Germany at the state or federal level. The recently created federal regulatory agency for <b>network</b> <b>industries</b> (Bundesnetzagentur) covers telecommunications, postal services, electricity, gas and rail. It does not cover water supply and sanitation, since it is a responsibility of the states. Water and sanitation tariffs are approved through different procedures in each state, usually by a department in the state Ministry of Economy after {{a review of the}} tariff increase request by an independent auditor. In city-states (Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen) this means that the Minister (called Senator) of Economy both requests the tariff increase in his capacity as {{chairman of the board of}} the utility and also approves it, which constitutes a conflict of interest. In the case of some private utilities, tariffs are set by a mutually agreed arbitrator based on the professional opinion of an auditor.|$|E
500|$|When Italian DVB-T {{broadcasting}} {{started in}} December 2010 interference {{was observed in}} northwest parts of Istria, and later in areas around Zadar and Šibenik. The interference {{was caused by the}} use of frequencies assigned to Croatia by Italian transmitters and excessive transmitter power. A complaint was filed by the Croatian regulator of the DVB-T market, the Croatian Regulatory Authority for <b>Network</b> <b>Industries</b> (HAKOM), with the Italian authorities. OIV installed additional transmitters in the affected areas to strengthen its signal coverage and reduce interference by February 2011 at a cost of 1million kuna ( [...] 133,000 euros). Although Italian Minister of Economic Development Paolo Romani announced in August 2011 that the problems should be resolved shortly (a transmitter causing interference was shut down and the power of several others was reduced), the situation was not completely resolved throughout 2011 and the International Telecommunication Union's Radio Regulations Board became involved in the process. In the meantime, other technical solutions were devised and implemented (in addition to the emergency transmitters) in order to improve digital-television-signal reception.|$|E

40|$|The Internet of Things, the {{continuing}} globalization of logistics networks, decreasing product life cycles and {{increasing numbers of}} product variants are examples of current developments that pose, in general, new requirements both on <b>networked</b> <b>industries</b> and on data in logistical systems. Volume, heterogeneity and importance of data for businesses are growing. In {{order to be able}} to manage data under these complexity constraints, <b>networked</b> <b>industries</b> need a current, comprehensive and consistent understanding of the data architecture, i. e. of the key data entities, their relationships, their sources of origin, trustworthiness, frequency of occurrence, quality and ownership. As current approaches for data architecture management in particular and data resource management in general fall short in providing support for this endeavor, the paper at hand proposes a morphology of the data resource in <b>networked</b> <b>industries.</b> The morphology is the result of a taxonomic analysis aiming at providing structure to complex data environments. The paper uses four case studies to identify and describe the dimensions of the morphology and its characteristics. Furthermore, the paper develops the baseline of a method for guiding the application of the morphology...|$|R

However, a new wave of equipment upgrade is unlikely to happen as current SONET equipment is just beginning to pay off for its large investment. Thus, in years to come, SONET technology, the current standard for optical fiber access, will have to make room for WDM technology in a gradual way. On its part, WDM equipment must be developed to be backward compatible with SONET technology. This article discusses the requirements and issues involved in making WDM technology interoperable with SONET legacy equipment, as well as the evolution path toward a transparent optical transport network...|$|R
