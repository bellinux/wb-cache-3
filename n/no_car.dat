5|$|A {{significant}} {{but small}} percentage of people have employment {{in the oil industry}} owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities, such as Inverness, Dingwall, Alness and Invergordon, which is why only 14% of households in the zone own <b>no</b> <b>car.</b> 10.4% {{of the population of the}} zone are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which soak up much of the tourist income that the town generates.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} {{talk of a}} Gilera-Ferrari in late 1962, with {{technical}} drawings released but <b>no</b> <b>car</b> ever seen, using a transversely mounted eight-cylinder engine based on two Gilera four-cylinder motorcycle blocks combined. This came to naught, however, and Ferrari ran smaller lighter 156 cars for the 1963 Formula One season. This time the team depended on drivers Bandini, John Surtees, Willy Mairesse and Ludovico Scarfiotti. Surtees won the 1963 German Grand Prix, at which Mairesse crashed heavily, rendering him unable to drive again.|$|E

He had <b>no</b> <b>car,</b> no hotel, not even a cuadrilla (bullfighting team). For the first time in his life, he turned to the lottery and drew two tickets with the numbers of the bulls of Ayala that he was scheduled to fight.

25|$|Early in 1923, Duff {{learned of}} a new 24Hour race {{to be held at}} Le Mans. He was the first entrant. W. O. Bentley, the founder and then-owner of Bentley Motors, thought it was madness and that <b>no</b> <b>car</b> would finish. In the face of Duff’s determination, he agreed to have the car {{prepared}} at the factory and let his test driver, Frank Clement, partner Duff. The Duff/Clement Bentley was one of the fastest cars, Duff setting the fastest lap at 9 mins 39 sec for the 10.726 mile lap. Rough track conditions took their toll as a flying stone holed the fuel tank, forcing Duff to run back to the pits. As only the drivers could work on the cars, Clement had to bicycle back with a can of gas to power the car back to the pits. Despite the drama, Duff and Clement finished a strong fourth. More importantly, W.O. Bentley, who only went over at the last minute, became hooked on Le Mans, the race that would make his cars famous.|$|E
25|$|A start {{was made}} in April on {{building}} the new depot at Carter Gate (Parliament Street), with accommodation for buses, trams and trolleybuses. Trams were given eight roads, all with pits, the capacity being 80 cars. A most complicated layout of track leading to the depot was put in at same time, the intention being to build a single line for one-way traffic inward to the Market Place along Lower Parliament Street and Hockley, via Victoria Street and South Parade, the outward route, also single line and one-way traffic via Long Row and Pelham Street to Hockley. Hockley was a narrow thoroughfare that had been widened towards its junction with Lower Parliament Street, but, owing to the Corporation being unable to obtain a property higher up the street at a reasonable price, the whole scheme was later abandoned, although not before much track and pointwork had been laid. The double turnout {{at the bottom of}} Hockley had been in position for approximately six months when it was removed together with the short length of track leading to it, <b>no</b> <b>car</b> ever having run over it. Lines built in connection with the depot were along Southwell Road, with a three-way junction at Manvers Street, another three-way junction at Lower Parliament Street, and then along Lower Parliament Street to within 30 yards of Pennyfoot Street. There were trailing points from both lines into Stanhope Street, where the depot entrances were. A single line ran along Stanhope Street, with trailing junctions both ways into Manvers Street.|$|E
