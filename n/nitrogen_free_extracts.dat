40|$|Page(s) : 11 (2), 293 - 299, 5 Ref. The {{present study}} aimed at {{providing}} the proximate {{analysis of the}} grains of nine sorghum varieties. The results showed that, in all varieties, crude fibres, crude fats and ash constituted (collectively) only 7. 2 % - 8. 3 % of the dry matter of the grains. The sum of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>free</b> <b>extracts</b> (NFE) and crude protein (CP), on the other hand, constituted 91 % to 92 % of the dry matter of the grains. In all varieties, the nutritive values of the grains, therefore, depend mainly on their contents of NFE and CP. In animal feeding, sorghum grains are usually used as energy sources, whereas groundnut seed cake is used as CP source. Correction of the relatively low CP of the grains {{of most of the}} varieties with groundnut seed cakes will, therefore, eliminate or reduce the difference in the nutritive values among the varieties. Selection of sorghum grains as animal feed could then be based solely on their market prices. Khartoum University Pres...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the proximate and mineral compositions of fore stomach digesta ensiled with groundnut haulms. Fresh fore stomach Digesta (FSD) was collected from slaughtered camels and cattle at Sokoto central abattoir and then ensiled with Groundnut haulms. The mixture was analyzed for proximate and mineral compositions after 3, 6 and 9 weeks of ensiling. Results showed that Moisture, crude fibre (CF), <b>nitrogen</b> <b>free</b> <b>extracts</b> (NFE) and ether extracts (EE) components increased with increase in ensiling period (P< 0. 05) while crude Protein (CP) decreased with increase in ensiling period. Calcium, potassium and phosphorus composition of the ensiled components also increased with increase in period of ensiling while sodium and magnesium did not (P< 0. 05). It could be concluded that increasing ensiling period beyond three weeks could decrease CP contents but could increase CF, NFE, Ca, P and K contents of the ensiled materials. Further studies should be carried out with other forage species to enhance the nutritive value of fore stomach digesta for its potential use as animal feed...|$|E

In the goat digestion trial, six dairy goats were used for each roughage sample in a total fecal collection trial to determine the digestible nutrients, including energy (DE) and total digestible nutrient (TDN). The in vivo ME value was calculated using the method of Shiemann et al. (1971) [Shiemann, R., Nehring, K., Hoffmann, L., Jentsch,W., Chudy, A., 1971. Energetische Futterbewertung und Energienormen. VEE Deutscher Land-wirtschaftsverlag, Berlin, p. 75. (in German) ] (ME 1 (MJ/kg) = 5. 2 DCP + 34. 2 DEE + 12. 8 DCF + 15. 9 DNFE, g/g). The in vitro ME value was then estimated from the chemical composition of the feed and amount of gas produced (Gb) from in vitro fermentation. The value calculated from both with (ME 3) and without (ME 2) the inclusion of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>free</b> <b>extracts</b> (NFE) in the prediction equation. (ME 2 (MJ/kg) = 0. 145 G(b) + 4. 12 CP + 6. 5 CP(2) + 20. 6 EE + 1. 54, g/g; ME 3 (MJ/kg) = 0. 118 G(b) + 8. 75 CP + 19. 21 EE + 3. 38 NFE + 0. 691, g/g). The 12 roughage samples consisted different growth stages of Napier grass Taishi No. 2 : (day of harvest; 40, 50, 60 and 65), dwarf Napiergrass Taishi No. 1 : (Day 40 and 65) and Pangola grass (Day 45) hay (Day 70), corn silage, imported alfalfa hay, timothy hay and Bermuda hay. The correlation between the ME values calculated from in vivo and in vitro without NFE was lower than with NFE inclusion in the equation. A higher correlation between the ME values calculated from in vivo and in vitro without NFE inclusion than with NFE inclusion in the prediction equation was obtained when alfalfa and corn silage were not included. This indicated that the ME value of forage could be estimated rapidly using this in vitro gas method adapted from Menke and Steingass (1988) [Menke, K. H., Steingass, H., 1988. Feed Sci. Technol. 28, 91 - 97] for practical applications in ration formulation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Digestibility {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} with dairy heifers to determine the digestibility of orchard grass, Dactylis glomerata, and also to evaluate the accuracy of various indicator techniques in pasture digestibility experiments. Chromic oxide {{was used as an}} external indicator to predict fecal dry matter output in three digestion trials. Cut grass was fed in one of the trials and corn silage in the other two. The internal indicators fecal nitrogen and protein of feed and feces were studied in two of the trials in which one conventional and one grazing trial were involved. The experimental animals consisted of six approximately two year old Holstein heifers and six Jersey heifers of the same ages. All animals were in about the fifth month of pregnancy. In the experiments, five grams of chromic oxide in gelatin capsules were fed to the animals twice a day at 7 A. M. and 4 P. M. Solka-floc, which is a pure cellulose material, was used as a carrier for chromic oxide. Fecal grab samples were collected from the rectum of grazing animals at 6 A. M. and 4 P. M. The chromic oxide recoveries in the feces of the stall fed animals fed orchard grass ranged from 98. 4 to 99. 2 percent, averaging 98. 8 percent. The average difference between the predicted and actual fecal dry matter output was 23. 1 g. This magnitude of difference yielded a 1. 01 percent error of prediction. However, chromic oxide recoveries for the silage trials were considerably lower, estimated as 79. 9 and 74. 9 percent for trials III and IV respectively. These low recoveries of chromic oxide resulted in a rather high error of prediction of fecal dry matter output with silages. The average errors of prediction for the grass forage dry matter intakes using fecal nitrogen and protein indigestibility techniques were found to be 1. 4 and - 6. 4 percent, respectively. The respective differences between the average actual and predicted forage dry matter intakes were 86. 1 and - 405. 2 g. Based on {{the results of this study}} the fecal nitrogen index technique appears to be superior to the protein indigestibility technique. The digestion coefficients of ether extracts were found to be higher for the conventional trial with pasture than for that of the grazing trial, while the reverse was true for the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>free</b> <b>extracts.</b> The average TDN and digestible energy values for orchard grass dry matter in the conventional trial were found to be 67. 1 and 68. 0 percent, respectively. The difference in estimations of the TDN and digestible energy values between total collection and fecal nitrogen technique was 0. 5 percent, which may be regarded as a reasonable error in digestibility experiments. The TDN and digestible energy values of the grazing trial were slightly higher than that of the conventional trial. The digestible energy determinations were highly correlated with the calculated TDN values. It was concluded that chromic oxide and fecal nitrogen may be used effectively in pasture digestibility experiments. More research is needed to establish their use as reliable indicators with single feed stuffs, such as silages, or when combined in complete rations...|$|E
