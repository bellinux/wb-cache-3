These geochemical systems promote the occurrence of <b>neoformations</b> that can have a detrimental effect on surfaces of the building materials.

In the present paper is presented a scanning electron microscopy study of macroscopic manifestations of <b>neoformations</b> detected on an extensive visual survey of several modern architectural works in urban aggregates of northern and central Portugal. The studies performed suggest that cementitious materials play an important role as sources of pollutants for the commonest <b>neoformations</b> such as carbonate rich stains and coatings as well as salt efflorescences of alkaline sulphates and carbonates. There are also indications of contributions from organic sources for alkaline nitrates and atmospheric pollution for gypsum-rich black crusts.

This detailed observational work, in conjunction with recently published work, has enabled identification of several mechanisms for remagnetization involving greigite: (1) <b>neoformation</b> of greigite on the surfaces of early diagenetic framboidal and nodular pyrite; (2) greigite growth within cleavages of detrital sheet silicate grains; (3) <b>neoformation</b> of greigite on the surfaces of authigenic clays (smectite, illite); (4) greigite nucleation on the surfaces of siderite; (5) greigite growth on the surface of gypsum that resulted from earlier oxidation of nodular pyrite.

In his films (Œdipus-Rex, 1967; Medea, 1970), Pasolini manifests a hankering after a form of the sacred that includes the tragic dimension, tragedy representing, according to the film maker, the outbreak of the sacred into man's daily life. While Œdipe-rex signals, through the figures of the « African » Sphinx and Tiresias (as interpreted by Julian Beck, the director of the Living Theatre) the emergence of tragedy and the sacred, Medea takes us back to the confrontation of the archaic religious world of the Colchean high-priestess and magician with Jason's rational world. Through the « modern » prologue and epilogue of Œdipus-rex Pasolini, by means of contemporary autobiographical fragments, gives us a meditation on (and an exemplary transposition of) the further developments and personal implications of Sophocles' tragedy. In Medea's prologue and at the beginning of the Corinthian sequence (after the quest for the Golden Fleece), Pasolini presents the twofold aspect of Chiron the Centaur : a figure at once mythical and human, who draws the lessons of the confrontation between the « primitive » societies and the retrograde conversion of Medea the high- priestess and magician on one hand and Jason's pragmatic world on the other. With the human sacrifice in Cholcos which refers us to reconstructed archaic agrarian rites, Pasolini presents a new interpretation in contradistinction with the Euripidian schemata. The interpretation is closely akin to a « poetic cinema » and bears on Absyrte's murder and the infanticide perpetrated by Medea in Corinth, both taking place within a sacred time-space framework. Through rituals centered round such objects as Medea's garb and women's choruses, Pasolini, in this film even more than in Œdipus-rex, presents a baroque filmic opera which is a tentative eulogy of barbarity and the sacred.

Thin cell layers from floral branches were cultured in the presence of a wide range (0 - 10 mu M) of indoleacetic acid alone, under various phototreatments (continuous darkness, 8 h light/day, and 16 h light/day).
