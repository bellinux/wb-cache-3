500|$|... "I'm Her Slave" [...] is {{a heroin}} anecdote with lyrics narrated by a subjugate lover. Music critic Greg Kot cites [...] "Turn On the Water" [...] {{as an example}} of when [...] "the twisted narrator is the victim" [...] and [...] "cast adrift" [...] in Dulli's lyrics. Inspired by a {{paranoid}} breakup, [...] "Conjure Me" [...] is told from the perspective of an aggressive predator and obscure object of desire. On [...] "Kiss the Floor", the narrator recounts stealing a girl's virginity and avoiding her brothers. [...] "This Is My Confession" [...] has a theme of absolution. The lyrics depicts it as an empty sexual experience: [...] "Shove my head against the door, crawl inside and kiss the floor / Waiting for the sun again, drink it, smoke it, stick it in." [...] "The Temple" [...] is a cover of the song of the same name from the 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. Dulli became a fan of the rock opera as a child when his babysitter played it. [...] "Let Me Lie to You" [...] has lyrics expressing passive cruelty and subtle manipulation. [...] "Tonight" [...] depicts a peaceful night as the backdrop for the narrator's corrupt one-track mind: [...] "Follow me down to the bushes, dear / <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>will</b> <b>know,</b> we'll disappear / I'll hold your hand, we'll never tell / Our private little trip to hell". The album's hidden track [...] "Miles Iz Ded" [...] is about seduction and alcohol, with a last call sensibility and despairing tone.|$|E
2500|$|... ”Your letter {{has filled}} me at once with sorrow and with joy. With sorrow at the sufferings {{you have to}} endure {{not only from the}} pagans, but also from Christians; with gladness at the {{conversion}} of the Northmen, who once revelled in human blood, but who now, by your words, rejoice that they are redeemed by the life-giving blood of Christ. For this we thank God, and implore Him to strengthen them in the faith. As to how far, inasmuch as they are uncultured, and but novices in the faith, they are to be subjected to severe canonical penances for their relapsing, killing of priests, and sacrificing to idols, we leave to your judgment to decide, as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> better than you the manners and customs of this people. You will, of course, understand well enough that it will not be advisable to treat them with the severity required by the canons, lest, thinking they {{will never be able to}} bear the unaccustomed burdens, they return to their old errors.” ...|$|E
2500|$|While his {{brothers}} indulged in fun and entertainment, Cao Gun was often seen reading {{and being in}} deep thought. The officials around Cao Gun discussed among themselves and said, [...] "His Majesty (Cao Pi) has ordered us to observe the Duke's behaviour. It's our duty to report to His Majesty when we see the Duke behaving inappropriately. However, when we see the Duke doing good deeds, we should also praise {{him in front of}} His Majesty." [...] They then wrote a memo to Cao Pi to praise Cao Gun. Cao Gun was shocked when he heard about it and he scolded the officials, [...] "It is one's responsibility to conduct himself with virtue and faithfully perform his duties. There's no need to tell anyone. Now that you've informed His Majesty, I feel more pressured and burdened. Besides, if one behaves well and does good deeds, why does he need to worry that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>will</b> <b>know?</b> What you've done is not helpful to me." [...] Such was Cao Gun's humility.|$|E

2500|$|Ōfuna had a {{reputation}} for intimidation and for torturing their inmates in an attempt to get military information, and was nicknamed the [...] "Torture Farm" [...] by its inmates. As the prisoners sent to Ōfuna were primarily officers, who might have inside knowledge of Allied Strategy, or others working in critical areas such as communications and submarines, it was the goal of the Japanese to extract as much information as possible in a short time. The names of the prisoners held at Ōfuna was not divulged to the Red Cross, and the camp was so secret that even local inhabitants were not aware of its existence. As relayed to a submarine prisoner: [...] "You have survived the sinking of a submarine. No one survives the sinking of a submarine. No one knows you're alive. We're going to ask you questions. This man and this man are going to shoot you if you don't answer the questions, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> you were alive." [...] In some cases, the inmates were told by their captors that they were regarded as war criminals, since 90 percent of the crews of the merchant vessels sunk by American submarines were civilians, and that as war criminals, they would be given only half the rations as normal prisoners of war.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her teenage}} years, she {{was locked up}} in a Nigerian prison cell because of her femininity. Being imprisoned {{encouraged}} her to leave Nigeria, if she could not have left, the other option was to finally succeed in ending her life. She remembered her experiences in this poignant piece she wrote for Gay Star News on Transgender Day of Remembrance on 20 November 2013, which was re-published by some online news outlets:I wish I could tell the younger me who tried to commit suicide twice that life gets better and dreams do honestly come through. [...] I did not imagine life could be this amazing many years ago after being released from a horrid Nigerian prison for being different. Then all I could think was I could die in this prison and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>will</b> <b>know</b> or care. [...] Being imprisoned felt justifiable, considering I was being punished for being 'gay' as they assumed due to my feminine features and mannerisms. [...] I wasn't gay, I am a woman born differently due to natural defects. What I felt did not match my outward appearance. Being assigned male at birth doesn't make me a man or a woman, nobody was born a man or a woman, you are born male or female, then you develop into your preferred gender as you grow up thus making you a man or a woman. For me that gender was female. I was born male but my brain, gestures, features and carriage functioned as that of a female. Growing up and not knowing what was happening to my body made me confused and lost. I couldn't discuss it with my family because my femininity was frowned upon due to religion and I could not talk to my friends because they would not understand what I was going through. I found solace in music and dreams. I dreamt of being free to be myself, free of insults, free of judgment and free from harassments. Her experience with the Nigerian police made her to seek [...] in London, United Kingdom.|$|E
