40|$|A wire boom {{deployment}} {{system has}} been developed that uses a mechanism {{which is similar to}} the classic yo-yo despin mechanism. The goal has been to develop a way to rapidly deploy wire booms from a spinning sounding-rocket experiment. The main challenge in using a yo-yo-type mechanism is to dissipate the excess kinetic energy so that the wire booms do not re-wrap themselves about the spacecraft after deploying. A ring has been added to the basic yoyo mechanism. It rotates with respect to the main spacecraft about the <b>nominal</b> <b>spin</b> axis, and the wire booms deploy from it. The ring/spacecraft joint is damped, and relative motion between the ring and the spacecraft dissipates the excess energy. This system is analyzed and simulated in 2 and 3 dimensions. Techniques are developed for tuning the damping law to rapidly deploy the wire booms without the occurrence of re-wrapping, and a criterion is presented that ensures 3 -dimensional stability of the final equilibrium in the global minimum-energy sense.

40|$|A {{sequential}} filter {{is presented}} for estimating {{the center of}} mass (CM) of a spinning spacecraft using Doppler shift data from a set of onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. The advantage of the proposed method {{is that it is}} passive and can be run continuously in the background without using commanded thruster firings to excite spacecraft dynamical motion for observability. The NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission is used as a test case for the CM estimator. The four MMS spacecraft carry star cameras for accurate attitude and spin rate estimation. The angle between the spacecraft <b>nominal</b> <b>spin</b> axis (for MMS this is the geometric body Z-axis) and the major principal axis of inertia is called the coning angle. The transverse components of the estimated rate provide a direct measure of the coning angle. The coning angle has been seen to shift slightly after every orbit and attitude maneuver. This change is attributed to a small asymmetry in the fuel distribution that changes with each burn. This paper shows a correlation between the apparent mass asymmetry deduced from the variations in the coning angle and the CM estimates made using the GPS Doppler data. The consistency between the changes in the coning angle and the CM provides validation of the proposed GPS Doppler method for estimation of the CM on spinning spacecraft...|$|R
