But I had not much time to give him, because I was helping the engine-driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders, to {{straighten}} a bent connecting-rod, and in other such matters. I lived in an infernal mess of rust, filings, <b>nuts,</b> bolts, <b>spanners,</b> hammers, ratchet-drills--things I abominate, because I don't get on with them. I tended the little forge we fortunately had aboard; I toiled wearily in a wretched scrap-heap--unless I had the shakes too bad to stand.|$|R
40|$|Engineers are {{tasked with}} {{designing}} new systems {{every day to}} meet changing or unexpected technical requirements. After the tragic explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986, NASA engineers embarked on a complete overhaul of many of their long-standing quality systems and procedures. When the official cause of the accident {{was determined to be}} an O-ring failure in the right Solid Rocket Booster, NASA's Shuttle Program initiated a thorough redesign of the rocket boosters' clevis ends, which are the O-ring's mating surfaces. One of the unique systems that NASA engineers developed {{as a result of this}} effort included a heating assembly that is coupled to the outside of the rocket boosters. When the assembly is affixed to the external surface of the boosters, the very nature of its design allows for the warming of the O-rings prior to launch. After the engineers completed the assembly's design, however, they found that it was nearly impossible to tighten the <b>spanner</b> <b>nuts</b> required for attaching the system, given the minimum amount of clearance they had in the limited and confined space. Under these circumstances, the standard wrenches typically used for tightening these types of nuts did not work, and there were no other existing devices to solve the problem. NASA engineers embraced the challenge, developing a torque wrench tool adapter that allowed for a full rotation of <b>spanner</b> <b>nuts</b> in confined spaces. The tool, which is similar to an open-ended crowfoot wrench and a fixed-face spanner wrench, contains two dowel pins that center and lock the wrench onto the nut...|$|R

(To simplify matters, {{the term}} hexagon {{will be used}} in this {{paragraph}} to denote either bolt head or <b>nut.)</b> Whitworth (<b>spanner)</b> markings refer to the bolt diameter rather than the distance across the flats of the hexagon (A/F) as in other standards. Confusion also arises because BSF hexagon sizes can be one size smaller than the corresponding Whitworth hexagon. This leads to instances where a spanner (wrench) marked 7/16BSF is the same size as one marked 3/8W. In both cases the spanner jaw width of 0.710 in, the width across the hexagon flat, is the same. However, in World War II the size of the Whitworth hexagon was reduced to {{the same size as the}} equivalent BSF hexagon purely to save metal during the war and they never went back to the old sizes afterwards. Thus it is today uncommon to encounter a Whitworth hexagon which takes the nominally correct spanner. Spanners in this case may be marked 7/16BS to indicate that they have a jaw size of 0.710 in and are designed to take either the (later) 7/16 BSW or 7/16 BSF hexagon.|$|R
