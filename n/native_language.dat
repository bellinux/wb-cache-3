40|$|Teaching and Learning Department {{capstone}} project. This capstone project provides monolingual {{teachers with}} both rationale {{and strategies for}} using students' <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> in the classroom to enhance students' academic achievement, English language development, self-esteem and identity development, bilingualism, and metalinguistic awareness. The number of English Language Learners in American public schools is increasing every year, yet these students are not achieving academic or English proficiency as measured by standardized assessments. Researchers have documented the use of students' <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> as a valuable academic resource tool for English Language Learners. Research shows that when teachers incorporate students' <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> into classroom instruction, students increase their metalinguistic awareness, learn more academic content, increase their English proficiency, and have more well-developed identities and self-esteem. However, incorporating students' <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> into the classroom can be very difficult in multilingual classrooms or in classrooms in which the teacher only speaks English. Furthermore, {{it is a political}} and emotional debate due to its roots in Americanism and English as a national language. However, the use of students' <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> can influence the success of English Language Learners in our school system. Therefore, finding strategies that allow teachers to incorporate students' <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> into the classroom, even when the teacher does not speak the language, is a vital issue for educators today. This paper addresses the benefits of incorporating students' <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> into daily classroom instruction, methods and strategies for using students' <b>native</b> <b>languages,</b> and an example of using students' <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> in a small-group setting.

40|$|The general {{assumption}} in {{this study}} was that the status of <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> in Zimbabwe was deteriorating while that of the English language was fast growing. No studies had been done on the issue, so this study aimed at exploring the impact of the English language on the Zimbabwean <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> since independence (1980 – 1999). ^ The data for this study were collected through literature searches, formal and informal observations of language use by Zimbabweans, and structured audio-taped interviews. Analysis of the data was done following the historical and phenomenological paradigms. ^ Results showed that English indeed impacted the <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> of Zimbabwe in the following aspects: school instruction, social and economic status, prestige, power, the job market, communication, the media, political administration, and culture. Shona and Ndebele are also considered official languages. Various minority languages and dialects continue to be threatened. Native people indicated a willingness to learn English even at the expense of their own <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> because of the perceived economic, social and political advantages it brings. ^ General recommendations made from the study are as follows: (1) Raising the awareness of Zimbabwean people of the need and importance of all their <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> in their lives. (2) Language policy decisions should start at the grassroots level rather than being imposed from above. (3) <b>Native</b> <b>languages</b> should play a complementary role in the education of children. (4) Schools and mass media should provide programs that enhance <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> and <b>native</b> cultures. ^ Further studies could explore language policy decisions, implementation and enforcement, minority languages, cultural and religious imperialism, how negative attitudes towards <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> can be changed and <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> and education. ...|$|R

The purpose of this thesis was to see how school library's work with development collection of literature in different <b>native</b> <b>languages.</b> The theoretical model used in this thesis is Evans and Saponaros' development collection model. The model is used to study {{how to work with}} development collection of literature in different <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> at eight school libraries. The method used is interviews. None of the interviewed school libraries have a purchasing policy or a media plan for the purchase of literature in different <b>native</b> <b>languages.</b> Three of the school libraries have no media appropriation and can't buy any literature at all. The other five school libraries buy literature in <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> when requested by pupils. None of the school library staff thinks that they have books in different <b>native</b> <b>languages</b> that cater to the pupil's needs. There are three resources' that the school library staff needs to develop their collection concerning literature in different native languages: time, funds and knowledge. These resources' are not enough for the school libraries in this essay. School libraries would need a well-developed plan for their work with development collection of literature in different <b>native</b> <b>languages...</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the <b>native</b> <b>language</b> of a {{significant}} part of the country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called Na'leh 16 included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another.|$|E
