5|$|The WindSeeker at Knott's Berry Farm {{differed}} from the other five in several ways. Rather than white, blue, and green on the tower, Knott's adopted a color scheme using orange, purple, and yellow to reflect the Spanish California theme of the Fiesta Village section of the park. The tower at Knott's had <b>no</b> <b>lights</b> at the top. The ride's sign had a Mexican theme and did not light up.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. <b>No</b> <b>lights</b> were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E
25|$|In February 1963, O'Reilly was {{involved}} in an accident between Urlingford and Johnstown, when his car struck a cyclist, who was injured. Locals testified that the injured man was careless, and he had <b>no</b> <b>lights</b> or reflector, and {{had been on the}} wrong side of the road. O'Reilly was convicted of driving with undue care, and fined 4 pounds, and since then he has rarely driven, especially at night.|$|E

25|$|Walsh {{was absent}} from the Sunday night results show due to {{the sudden death of}} Boyzone singer and close friend Stephen Gately, whom he managed. Due to this, the show did not take its usual format; there were <b>no</b> <b>lights</b> and neither O'Leary nor the three other judges made an entrance. Instead, the show {{commenced}} with O'Leary already on stage and the judges already sitting at their desk. Both O'Leary and Cowell addressed the viewers and audience regarding Gately's death and Walsh's absence. Following this, the show went on as normal with Minogue, Cowell and Cole present as judges.|$|E
25|$|The {{company was}} marching from Melville Barracks to the Royal Naval Barracks, Chatham, {{to attend a}} boxing tournament. It was divided into three platoons; the rear platoon {{consisted}} of new recruits {{who had not yet}} received uniforms. They were generally under the command of cadet non-commissioned officers (NCOs); the only adult present was the contingent adjutant, Lieutenant Clarence Murrayfield Carter, a regular Royal Marines officer. The column was about fifteen yards long and was marching three abreast on the left-hand side of the road. It was showing <b>no</b> <b>lights,</b> there being no official requirement to do so, and the boys in uniform were wearing Royal Marines standard-issue dark blue battledress and berets, although they had white belts and white lanyards on their shoulders.|$|E
25|$|Only priests {{attached}} to a fire temple may enter the innermost sanctum itself, which is closed {{on at least one}} side and has a double domed roof. The double dome has vents to allow the smoke to escape, but the vents of the outer dome are offset from those of the inner, so preventing debris or rain from entering the inner sanctum. The sanctum is separated from the anteroom by dividers (or walls with very large openings) and is slightly raised with respect to the space around it. The wall(s) of the inner sanctum are almost always tiled or of marble, but are otherwise undecorated. There are <b>no</b> <b>lights</b> – other than that of the fire itself – in the inner sanctum. In Indian-Zoroastrian (not evident in the modern buildings in Iran) tradition the temples are often designed such that direct sunlight does not enter the sanctuary.|$|E

25|$|For {{their first}} 13 seasons (1995–2007), the OTBzz played {{most of their}} home matches {{outdoors}} at Central Park Tennis Stadium in Schenectady, New York. In instances where heavy rain was in the forecast {{making it impossible to}} play outdoors, {{and in the case of}} a power failure at Central Park Tennis Stadium before the opening match of the 2005 season, matches were occasionally moved indoors to Sportime Schenectady in Rotterdam, New York, just outside Schenectady or to the Tri-City Racquet Club in Latham, New York, a bit further away from Schenectady. Some matches featuring opposing teams with marquee players were scheduled to be played indoors. For the OTBzz's first season at Central Park Tennis Stadium, the team had to play all its matches in the daytime, because the stadium had <b>no</b> <b>lights.</b> The Schenectady Common Council had lights installed in the stadium allowing night matches to be played starting in 1996. No admission was charged to the OTBzz's home matches for their first three seasons. In 1998, the team started charging $7 for general admission tickets.|$|E
25|$|Before 2011, a cab's {{availability}} {{was indicated}} by {{the lights on the}} top of the car. When <b>no</b> <b>lights</b> were lit, the cab would be occupied by passengers. When just the center light showing the medallion number was lit, the cab would be empty and available. When the OFF and DUTY inscriptions to either side of the medallion number were lit, with the medallion number off, the cab would be off duty and not accepting passengers. However, when the OFF and DUTY inscriptions were lit and the medallion number was still lit, the cab would be off duty but the driver could choose to pick up passengers heading in the same direction as the driver. In fall 2011, the TLC announced a plan to replace the three-light system with a simple indicator as to whether the taxi is available. In 2012, the TLC simplified the light system further, with a lit roof light indicating that the taxi is available and an unlit light indicating that the taxi is not available, regardless of whether it has passengers or is simply off duty. It also started fining drivers $100 for picking up passengers without the light on, except for if the driver is picking up their last passenger of their shift.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} day Tryon feinted, pretending to send out two torpedo boats and a battleship, causing Markham to scurry to intercept. For {{the next two days}} he did nothing, except fire {{occasional}} shots at Markham's ships from shore batteries if they came too close. On the fourth evening he sent out two torpedo boats showing <b>no</b> <b>lights</b> with the intention of starting more false alarms. The boats did well, returning with four enemy torpedo boats which they had surprised and captured. By 3 August the enemy had been at sea for nine days and aside from the tedium of their wait would now be low on coal. Tryon ordered all ships to be ready to sail at 9.30pm on 3 August and for all the upper parts of the ships to be painted black. The fastest ships, Warspite, Iris, Severn, Volage, Cossack and three torpedo boats left via the western entrance, staying as close to the shore as they dared, heading for the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Tryon took the remaining larger ships through the eastern entrance, giving the appearance of an attempt to break through the blockading ships. Within an hour the Hercules was spotted and great excitement broke out amongst the blockaders. Tryon immediately turned around and headed back to port. Just as they returned to anchor, flares at sea showed that, too late, one blockader had spotted Tryon's escaping ships.|$|E

25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with <b>no</b> <b>lights</b> on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E
500|$|On 24 January 1989, airmen {{monitoring}} the radar at the Northeast Air Defense Sector at Griffiss Air Force Base spotted a plane {{which was not}} following any known flight plan.

500|$|A {{week after}} the long range shoot at Vieques, Iowas new {{executive}} officer, Commander John Morse, directed a main battery drill, {{over the objections of}} his gun crews, in which Turrets One and Two fired while both were pointed 15° off the starboard side of the ship's bow. At this angle, one of Turret Two's guns was firing over Turret One. During the shoot, according to Turret Two's left gun captain, Jack Thompson, one of the powder bags in the left gun began to smolder before the breechlock was closed. Thompson said that he was barely able to close and latch the breechlock before the gun discharged on its own. The concussion from Turret Two's guns shredded Turret One's gun bloomers (the canvas covers {{at the base of the}} main gun barrels) and damaged Turret One's electrical system. Dan Meyer said of the shoot that it was [...] "the most frightening experience I have ever had in my life. The shock wave blew out the turret officer's switchboard and the leads. We had no power, <b>no</b> <b>lights</b> for a time. Men were screaming. There was panic." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the other}} boats, {{there was nothing}} the {{survivors}} could do but await the arrival of rescue ships. The air was bitterly cold {{and several of the}} boats had taken on water. The survivors could not find any food or drinkable water in the boats, and most had <b>no</b> <b>lights.</b> The situation was particularly bad aboard collapsible B, which was only kept afloat by a diminishing air pocket in the upturned hull. As dawn approached, the wind rose and the sea became increasingly choppy, forcing those on the collapsible boat to stand up to balance it. Some, exhausted by the ordeal, fell off into the sea and were drowned. It became steadily harder for the rest to keep their balance on the hull, with waves washing across it. Archibald Gracie later wrote of how he and the other survivors sitting on the upturned hull were struck by [...] "the utter helplessness of our position." [...] Some swimmers who had reached collapsible A had not enough strength to come aboard, and had to cling to the boat's sides. The bodies {{of the majority of the}} people who died during the night were lowered into the sea to make more room for the survivors.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} November 11, 2012 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Filming also {{took place in}} Baton Rouge. Jennifer Garner has stated that the film was shot very quickly over just 25 days and has remarked that McConaughey [...] "gave an even wilder performance in takes that didn't appear onscreen". McConaughey stated that [...] "I was riding {{a new way of}} making a film. There were <b>no</b> <b>lights,</b> one camera, 15-minute takes." [...] Half of the shots were lit with artificial light and the other half were not. Vallée said: [...] "I now had a perfect opportunity to try to shoot an entire movie without artificial lights, using the Alexa digital camera. Like the RED, the Alexa offers a broad spectrum of colors and shadows in even the darkest natural lighting conditions. I felt that the approach was right for this project. The look and feel became that we were capturing reality; even though Dallas Buyers Club is not a documentary in content or structure, it could have that subtle quality. We shot the movie 100% handheld with two lenses, a 35-millimeter and a 50-millimeter. These get close to the actors and don't skew the images. (Director of Photography) Yves Belanger adjusted for every shot at 400 or 1600 ASA (light sensitivity), displaying different color balance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{crossings}} in {{the country}} now are composed of lights, alarms and full, half or no barriers. The lights are unique in {{that they have a}} preliminary amber light accompanied by two red lights. The alarms come in a range of tones, and can be composed of a speaking warning saying [...] "warning: another train is approaching". Many crossings are automatic, but can be manually operated or by CCTV or obstacle detection.
