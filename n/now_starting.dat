5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are <b>now</b> <b>starting</b> to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, while {{streaming}} still exists, various refinements {{to the policy}} have been made. There is now greater flexibility for students to cross over different streams or take subjects in other streams, which alleviates somewhat the stigma attached to being in any single stream. Furthermore, the government is <b>now</b> <b>starting</b> to experiment with ability-banding in other ways – such as subject-based banding in Primary Schools instead of banding by overall academic performance.|$|E

Since the 1990s Punjab hosted several key sites of Pakistan's nuclear program such as Kahuta. It also hosts major military bases such as at Sargodha and Rawalpindi. The peace process between India and Pakistan, which began in earnest in 2004, has helped pacify the situation.

The use of ultraviolet light has now become standard practice in most municipal {{wastewater treatment}} processes. Effluent is <b>now</b> <b>starting</b> to be recognized as a valuable resource, not a problem that needs to be dumped. Many wastewater facilities are being renamed as water reclamation facilities, whether the wastewater is discharged into a river, used to irrigate crops, or injected into an aquifer for later recovery. Ultraviolet light is now being used to ensure water is free from harmful organisms.|$|E
25|$|After {{three years}} of bloody and {{inconclusive}} fighting, Confederate authorities were becoming desperate as the U.S. presidential election approached {{in the fall of}} 1864. Although the fortunes of war had largely favored the South prior to 1863, events were <b>now</b> <b>starting</b> to favor the Union. In the Eastern Theater, Ulysses S. Grant had Robert E. Lee pinned down in the Siege of Petersburg; Jubal Early had been driven back from the outskirts of Washington, D.C., while Philip Sheridan was now pursuing him in the Shenandoah Valley; and William T. Sherman had captured Atlanta. With foreign recognition for the Confederacy not forthcoming, Southerners realized that President Abraham Lincoln's re-election would be disastrous for their cause, especially as Lincoln's primary opponent, George McClellan, had campaigned on the promise of conciliating the South with offers of peace.|$|E

25|$|Emperor Wu of Chen {{came from}} the region of Wu (a region near modern-day Shanghai). At that time, due to the Hou Jing rebellion, the Qiao and Wu clans were greatly weakened, and many {{independent}} regimes emerged. Emperor Wu could not pacify all the independent regimes, so he adopted conciliatory measures. After {{the sudden death of}} Emperor Wu, his nephew Chen Qian took power as Emperor Wen of Chen. After the fall of Liang, the general Wang Lin had established an independent kingdom based in modern-day Hunan and Hubei provinces and was <b>now</b> <b>starting</b> to cause trouble. Wang Lin allied with Northern Zhou and Northern Qi to conquer the Chen capital at Jiankang. Emperor Wen first defeated the combined forces of Northern Qi and Wang Lin before preventing the forces of Northern Zhou from entering the South at Yueyang. Furthermore, through Emperor Wen's extensive efforts at good governance, the economic situation of the South was greatly improved, restoring his kingdom's national strength.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} quarter, Denver {{took over the}} game. Jacksonville was forced to punt after Elway's second fumble, and Barker's 27-yard kick gave Denver a first down on the Jacksonville 48. From there it took just two plays to score, a 23-yard {{completion}} from Elway to tight end Shannon Sharpe and a 25-yard touchdown run by Derek Loville, making the score 28-17. The Jaguars made one last spirited comeback attempt, but Gordon {{put an end to}} it by intercepting a pass from Brunell in the end zone. Denver then drove 80 yards in 10 plays, eight of them carries by Loville (including a 44-yard run), who was <b>now</b> <b>starting</b> in place of the injured Davis. On the last play, his 8-yard touchdown run gave Denver a 35-17 lead. Now in a desperate situation, Brunell attempted to convert a fourth and 10 on the Jaguars next drive, but Gordon sacked him for a 10-yard loss, while a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on receiver Keenan McCardell gave the Broncos a first down on the Jacksonville 15-yard line. A few plays later, Hebron finished off the scoring on a 6-yard touchdown run with 1:16 left in the game.|$|E

500|$|After the tour, Radiohead re-enlisted Godrich, who, {{according}} to Yorke, [...] "gave us a walloping kick up the arse". In October 2006, recording started at Tottenham House in Marlborough, Wiltshire, a country house scouted by Godrich where Radiohead worked for three weeks. The band members lived in caravans, as {{the building was}} in a state of disrepair; Yorke described it as [...] "derelict in the stricter sense of the word, where there's holes in the floor, rain coming through the ceilings, half the window panes missing ... There were places you just basically didn't go. It definitely had an effect. It had some pretty strange vibes." [...] The sessions were productive, and the band recorded [...] "Jigsaw Falling into Place" [...] and [...] "Bodysnatchers". In October, Yorke wrote on Dead Air Space that Radiohead had [...] "started the record properly <b>now</b> ... <b>starting</b> to get somewhere I think. Finally." ...|$|E
500|$|Lawrence's health {{caused her}} to miss several rehearsals, though {{no one knew what}} was wrong with her. When the tryout opened in New Haven, Connecticut on February 27, 1951, the show was nearly four hours long. Lawrence, {{suffering}} from laryngitis, had missed the dress rehearsal but managed {{to make it through the}} first public performance. The Variety critic noted that despite her recent illness she [...] "slinks, acts, cavorts, and in general exhibits exceedingly well her several facets for entertaining", but the Philadelphia Bulletin printed that her [...] "already thin voice is <b>now</b> <b>starting</b> to wear a great deal thinner". [...] Leland Hayward came to see the show in New Haven and shocked Rodgers by advising him to close it before it went any further. [...] Additionally, when the show left New Haven for Boston for more tryout performances, it was still at least 45minutes too long.

500|$|After the Sequel has {{received}} positive coverage for its revitalization of retro Sonic gameplay. Tony Ponce of Destructoid summarized it as [...] "quite the fun little gem {{that keeps the}} Genesis-era Sonic spirit alive". He contrasted the retro, fan-made After the Sequel with Sega's efforts to create high-quality 3D titles, lamenting that, fifteen years {{after the release of}} Sonic Adventure, Sega was [...] "only <b>now</b> <b>starting</b> to get the hang of the third dimension." [...] John Polson from IndieGames.com called the game [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "stunning", while Kotaku's András Neltz stated that [...] "it looks amazing" [...] and advised readers not to let the game's status as a fan work turn them away from it. Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran also called the game [...] "impressive". The UK gaming staff for Red Bull's website stated that, despite Sega's continual releases of Sonic games, [...] "few have quite recaptured the thrill of blazing through a 2D labyrinth at lightspeed in the way that fan made Sonic After The Sequel has." [...] A second Red Bull article, by author Ben Sillis, exclaimed that [...] "you have to play" [...] it.|$|E
500|$|Although no {{materials}} {{appear to}} exist specifically addressing {{the composition of}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea", Andersen does speak to {{the writing of the}} first four tales of 1835 of which [...] "The Princess on the Pea" [...] is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: [...] "I am <b>now</b> <b>starting</b> on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, you may want to know", and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, Bernhard Severin Ingemann: [...] "I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded. I have told a couple of tales which as a child I was happy about, and which I do not believe are known, and have written them exactly the way I would tell them to a child." [...] Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: [...] "I have also written some fairy tales for children; Ørsted says about them that if The Improvisatore makes me famous then these will make me immortal, for they are the most perfect things I have written; but I myself do not think so." [...] On 26March, he observed that [...] " [...] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's {{management}} {{organized the}} spare {{time from the}} UK tour to record new songs for a third album {{over the course of}} February and March 1969 at De Lane Lea Studios, with Lawrence as producer and Barry Ainsworth as sound engineer. The pressure of the multiple engagements left the band very little time for composition and most of the tracks were written and rehearsed in the studio. The musicians were <b>now</b> <b>starting</b> to fully endeavour to write original material and found ideas for seven songs, more than on either of their first two albums. Musical and lyrical inspiration came from very disparate sources. The opener [...] "Chasing Shadows" [...] was based upon African rhythms created by drummer Ian Paice. The dour and baroque [...] "Blind" [...] was written by Lord about one of his nightmares. The short instrumental [...] "Fault Line" [...] was inspired by an earthquake that the band had experienced while in Los Angeles and featured Paice's drum patterns reversed and double tracked. Roman Polanski's movie Rosemary's Baby, which the band members had watched together at a cinema, was the main inspiration for the blues rocker [...] "Why Didn't Rosemary?" [...] "April" [...] was a tune written by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore about his birthday month before the recording sessions had begun; it was later augmented with a long middle section of classical music written by Lord, becoming the album's 12-minutes final track and Deep Purple's longest ever studio recording. The only cover song on the album is the Donovan-penned ballad [...] "Lalena", which had been a Top 40 single for its author in the US in the autumn of 1968.|$|E
