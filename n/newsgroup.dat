5|$|From its inception, users {{would use}} the <b>newsgroup</b> to discuss {{the quality of the}} episode, as well as to talk about {{continuity}} errors and trivia. They would also discuss cultural references, usually related to pop culture. Another common topic is freeze frame gags, which are jokes that can only be seen when the viewer tapes the episode and freezes the image. All of these many discussions were compiled and submitted to The Simpsons Archive, which contains at least 330 episode guides as well as other guides. The <b>newsgroup</b> also provides The Simpsons Archive with information on the characters and the setting, as well as a compilation of articles about the show and interview with its cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|Larry Wall {{began work}} on Perl in 1987, {{while working as a}} {{programmer}} at Unisys, and released version 1.0 to the comp.sources.misc <b>newsgroup</b> on December 18, 1987. The language expanded rapidly over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|The {{writers of}} the show {{are aware of the}} <b>newsgroup</b> and {{sometimes}} make jokes at its expense. Within the series, the character Comic Book Guy is often used to represent a stereotypical inhabitant of alt.tv.simpsons.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the social}} {{roles of the}} members a group can help to {{understand}} {{the social context of}} the group. We present a method of applying social network analysis to support the task of characterizing authors in Usenet <b>newsgroups.</b> We compute and visualize networks created by patterns of replies for each author in selected <b>newsgroups</b> and find that second-degree ego-centric networks give us clear distinctions between different types of authors and <b>newsgroups.</b> Results show that <b>newsgroups</b> vary in terms of the populations of participants and the roles that they play. <b>Newsgroups</b> can be characterized by populations that include question and answer <b>newsgroups,</b> conversational <b>newsgroups,</b> social support <b>newsgroups,</b> and flame <b>newsgroups.</b> This approach has applications for both researchers seeking to characterize different types of social cyberspaces as well as participants seeking to distinguish interaction partners and content authors. 1...|$|R

5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet <b>newsgroup,</b> inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the message was demonstrated when white lights {{in front of the}} stage at a performance in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|Other {{features}} include Bloodhound technology, which looks for virus-like behavior to better find zero day viruses. The Security Inspector looks for common vulnerabilities, including insecure user account passwords and browser insecurities. Advertisement blocking rewrites a website's HTML to prevent advertisements from being displayed. Parental controls, an optional component, can block certain programs from accessing the Internet, such as IM clients, and restrict <b>newsgroup</b> access. Restrictions {{can be assigned}} to different Windows users accounts. Sites are classified in 31 categories, and the four profiles which can be assigned each block different categories of sites. Supervisors define exceptions, add global blocked sites, or block all access to sites not on a user-created whitelist. Both PC Magazine and PC Pro noted the exclusion of time-based restrictions. Information filtering can be controlled on a per-user basis.|$|E
25|$|A {{minority}} of newsgroups are moderated, meaning that messages submitted by readers are not distributed directly to Usenet, but instead are emailed to the moderators of the <b>newsgroup</b> for approval. The moderator is to receive submitted articles, review them, and inject approved articles {{so that they}} can be properly propagated worldwide. Articles approved by a moderator must bear the Approved: header line. Moderators ensure that the messages that readers see in the <b>newsgroup</b> conform to the charter of the <b>newsgroup,</b> though they are not required to follow any such rules or guidelines. Typically, moderators are appointed in the proposal for the <b>newsgroup,</b> and changes of moderators follow a succession plan.|$|E
50|$|Crossposting to {{more than}} a small number of <b>newsgroups</b> is likely to be counterproductive. A {{commonly}} suggested limit is three <b>newsgroups.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mozilla Application Suite {{has been}} {{superseded}} by SeaMonkey and the email and news client is now SeaMonkey Mail & <b>Newsgroups.</b> A re-packaged version of Mozilla Mail and <b>Newsgroups</b> was {{also included in}} Netscape versions 6 and 7, known as Netscape Mail & <b>Newsgroups,</b> and also appears in Classilla.|$|R

25|$|Scott Goehring {{set up the}} <b>newsgroup</b> alt.religion.scientology in 1991, {{partly as}} a joke, partly {{for the purpose of}} informing the public about Scientology. Debate over {{the pros and cons of}} Scientology waxed and waned on the <b>newsgroup</b> through the first three years of its existence, and flame wars flared up commonly, as they did on some other newsgroups.|$|E
25|$|Usenet newsgroups in the Big-8 {{hierarchy}} {{are created}} by proposals called a Request for Discussion, or RFD. The RFD is required to have the following information: <b>newsgroup</b> name, checkgroups file entry, and moderated or unmoderated status. If the group is to be moderated, then at least one moderator with a valid email address must be provided. Other information which is beneficial but not required includes: a charter, a rationale, and a moderation policy if the group is to be moderated. Discussion of the new <b>newsgroup</b> proposal follows, and is finished {{with the members of}} the Big-8 Management Board making the decision, by vote, to either approve or disapprove the new <b>newsgroup.</b>|$|E
25|$|Damage: Impact on the {{community}} and/or communication channels being spammed (see <b>Newsgroup</b> spam).|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} <b>newsgroups</b> grew {{from more than}} 100 as of 1983 to more than 110,000, but only 20,000 or so of those are active. <b>Newsgroups</b> vary in popularity; some <b>newsgroups</b> receive under a dozen posts per year while the most popular can get several {{thousand}} in under an hour.|$|R
50|$|Another free {{source of}} {{pornography}} on the Internet are the Usenet <b>newsgroups</b> {{that were the}} first home to such material. <b>Newsgroups</b> tend to be poorly organized and flooded with content that is off-topic or spam. Commercial software and websites are available that allow browsing the images or videos on <b>newsgroups,</b> sometimes with galleries of thumbnail images.|$|R
5000|$|The alt.* {{hierarchy}} {{is a major}} {{class of}} <b>newsgroups</b> in Usenet, containing all <b>newsgroups</b> whose name begins with [...] "alt.", organized hierarchically. The alt.* hierarchy {{is not confined to}} <b>newsgroups</b> of any specific subject or type, although in practice more formally organized groups tend not to occur in alt.*. The alt.* hierarchy was created by John Gilmore and Brian Reid.|$|R
25|$|Arc Symphony is a text-based {{adventure}} game, and {{is presented}} as an old computer through which the player reads messages in a Usenet <b>newsgroup</b> dedicated to a fictional Japanese role-playing video game (JRPG) for the PlayStation game console, also titled Arc Symphony. The player takes {{the role of a}} formerly active user of the group, and begins the game by taking a personality quiz. Messages include discussions about the fictional Arc Symphony characters and writing and about the <b>newsgroup</b> users' usernames. The characters the player interacts with include a couple who chat on IRC at the same time by using two phone lines, a new user who provokes people, and a university professor who wants to be called by his username rather than his real one when in the <b>newsgroup.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} an effort to {{differentiate}} between types of <b>newsgroup</b> spam. Messages that were crossposted to too many newsgroups at once – {{as opposed to those}} that were posted too frequently – were called velveeta (after a cheese product). But this term didn't persist.|$|E
25|$|SeaMonkey (formerly the Mozilla Application Suite) is a {{free and}} open source cross {{platform}} suite of Internet software components including a web browser component, a client for sending and receiving email and Usenet <b>newsgroup</b> messages, an HTML editor (Mozilla Composer) and the ChatZilla IRC client.|$|E
50|$|These <b>newsgroups</b> were {{categorized}} {{into a series}} of hierarchies, {{to make it easier for}} <b>newsgroups</b> to be created and distributed. The original hierarchies were comp.*, misc.*, news.*, rec.*, sci.*, soc.*, and talk.*.|$|R
40|$|The {{activities}} of white racists and racialists have evolved rapidly since {{the invention of}} the World Wide Web and Internet <b>newsgroups.</b> In the UK, white racists use mainstream politics <b>newsgroups</b> such as Alt. politics. british and Soc. culture. british to discuss racial superiority and inferiority, inspire violence against people and property, make threats and attract new recruits. In the USA, white racists tend to set up specialist white racialist <b>newsgroups</b> such as Alt. politics. nationalism. white, alt. revisionism and alt. flameniggers. On-line anti-Nazi/fascist activists have achieved successes in disrupting race hate postings in some <b>newsgroups,</b> but white racialists have had considerably more success in spreading their messages through Web sites. This provides some useful insights into the social dynamics of white racist and anti-racist activists in Internet <b>newsgroups...</b>|$|R
25|$|Newsreader: The main {{difference}} between <b>newsgroups</b> and forums is that additional software, a News client, {{is required to}} participate in <b>newsgroups</b> whereas using a forum requires no additional software beyond the web browser.|$|R
25|$|The Linux kernel {{originated}} in 1991, {{as a project}} of Linus Torvalds, while a university student in Finland. He posted information about his project on a <b>newsgroup</b> for computer students and programmers, and received support and assistance from volunteers who succeeded in creating a complete and functional kernel.|$|E
25|$|Early Internet forums {{could be}} {{described}} as a web version of an electronic mailing list or <b>newsgroup</b> (such as exist on Usenet); allowing people to post messages and comment on other messages. Later developments emulated the different newsgroups or individual lists, providing more than one forum, dedicated to a particular topic.|$|E
25|$|The online {{battle is}} {{generally}} regarded as having begun {{with the arrival of}} Dennis Erlich to alt.religion.scientology in late July 1994. A former high-ranking official in the Scientology organization who had been personally affiliated with L. Ron Hubbard, he caused a number of regular participants in the <b>newsgroup</b> to sit up and take notice.|$|E
50|$|Tolkien {{discussion}} {{took place}} in many <b>newsgroups</b> from {{the earliest days of}} Usenet. The Tolklang mailing list was started in 1990. The alt.fan.tolkien and rec.arts.books.tolkien <b>newsgroups</b> have been active since 1992 and 1993, respectively.|$|R

50|$|Non-Usenet <b>newsgroups</b> are {{possible}} and do occur, as private individuals or organizations {{set up their}} own NNTP servers. Examples include the <b>newsgroups</b> Microsoft runs to allow peer-to-peer support of their products and those at news://news.grc.com.|$|R
25|$|The Internet {{makes it}} easier to both spread urban legends and debunk them. Discussing, tracking, and {{analyzing}} urban legends is the topic of the Usenet <b>newsgroup,</b> alt.folklore.urban and several web sites, most notably snopes.com. The United States Department of Energy had a service, now discontinued, called Hoaxbusters, that dealt with computer-distributed hoaxes and legends.|$|E
25|$|The Year 2000 {{problem was}} the subject of the early book, Computers in Crisis by Jerome and Marilyn Murray (Petrocelli, 1984; reissued by McGraw-Hill under the title The Year 2000 Computing Crisis in 1996). The first {{recorded}} mention of the Year 2000 Problem on a Usenet <b>newsgroup</b> occurred on Friday, 18 January 1985, by Usenet poster Spencer Bolles.|$|E
25|$|The 2002 {{advent of}} American Communist History, and its regular {{announcement}} of new publications, and the H-HOAC <b>newsgroup,</b> and its regular announcement {{of research in}} progress and exchange of information about various esoteric research issues, made {{the continuation of the}} Newsletter of the Historians of American Communism moot. That publication terminated publication effective with the July 2004 issue.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, spam became {{used as a}} means of vandalising <b>newsgroups,</b> with {{malicious}} users committing acts of sporgery to make targeted <b>newsgroups</b> all but unreadable without heavily filtering. A prominent example occurred in alt.religion.scientology.|$|R
5000|$|Over time, the {{accumulated}} FAQs across all USENET news groups sparked {{the creation of}} the [...] "*.answers" [...] moderated <b>newsgroups</b> such as comp.answers, misc.answers and sci.answers for crossposting and collecting FAQ across respective comp.*, misc.*, sci.* <b>newsgroups.</b>|$|R
50|$|Online {{anonymity}} can {{be traced}} to Usenet <b>newsgroups</b> in the late 1990s where the notion of using invalid emails for posting to <b>newsgroups</b> was introduced. This was primarily used for discussion on <b>newsgroups</b> pertaining to certain sensitive topics. There was also the introduction of anonymous remailers which were capable of stripping away the sender's address from mail packets before sending them to the receiver. Online services which facilitated anonymous posting sprang up around mid-1992, originating with the cypherpunk group.|$|R
