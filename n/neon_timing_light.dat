40|$|Timing light {{systems are}} {{commonly}} used to measure sprint times of athletes. In this study, the reliability and effect of <b>timing</b> <b>light</b> height on sprint times was investigated. Two sets of <b>timing</b> <b>lights</b> set at hip and shoulder height, simultaneously timed subjects over 10 and 20 meters. The within-trial variation of both <b>timing</b> <b>light</b> heights were equally consistent; all coefficients of variation (CV) less than 1. 2...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{innovations}} in smartphone technology {{have led to}} the development of a number of applications for the valid and reliable measurement of physical performance. Smartphone applications offer a number of advantages over laboratory based testing including cost, portability, and absence of postprocessing. However, smartphone applications for the measurement of running speed have not yet been validated. In the present study, the iOS smartphone application, SpeedClock, was compared to conventional <b>timing</b> <b>lights</b> during flying 10 [*]m sprints in recreationally active women. Independent samples t-test showed no statistically significant difference between SpeedClock and <b>timing</b> <b>lights</b> (t(190) = 1. 83, p= 0. 07), while intraclass correlations showed excellent agreement between SpeedClock and <b>timing</b> <b>lights</b> (ICC (2, 1) = 0. 93, p= 0. 00, 95 % CI 0. 64 – 0. 97). Bland-Altman plots showed a small systematic bias (mean difference = 0. 13 seconds) with SpeedClock giving slightly lower values compared to the <b>timing</b> <b>lights.</b> Our findings suggest SpeedClock for iOS devices is a low-cost, valid tool for the assessment of mean flying 10 [*]m sprint velocity in recreationally active females. Systematic bias should be considered when interpreting the results from SpeedClock...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Commercial <b>timing</b> <b>light</b> systems (CTLS) provide precise {{measurement}} of athletes running velocity, however {{they are often}} expensive and difficult to transport. In this study an inexpensive, wireless and portable <b>timing</b> <b>light</b> system was created using the infrared camera in Nintendo Wii hand controllers (NWHC). Design: System creation with gold-standard validation. Method: A Windows-based software program using NWHC to replicate a dual-beam timing gate was created. Firstly, data collected during 2. m walking and running trials were validated against a 3 D kinematic system. Secondly, data recorded during 5. m running trials at various intensities from standing or flying starts were compared to a single beam CTLS and the independent and average scores of three handheld stopwatch (HS) operators. Intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots {{were used to assess}} validity. Absolute error quartiles and percentage of trials in absolute error threshold ranges were used to determine accuracy. Results: The NWHC system was valid when compared against the 3 D kinematic system (ICC. = 0. 99, median absolute error (MAR). = 2. 95 %). For the flying 5. m trials the NWHC system possessed excellent validity and precision (ICC. = 0. 97, MAR 8 %). Conclusions: A NWHC <b>timing</b> <b>light</b> system is inexpensive, portable and valid for assessing running velocity. Errors in the 5. m standing start trials may have been due to erroneous event detection by either the commercial or NWHC-based <b>timing</b> <b>light</b> systems. © 2010 Sports Medicine Australia...|$|R
50|$|A <b>timing</b> <b>light</b> {{may be a}} {{self-contained}} instrument, but is sometimes combined with a voltmeter, RPM meter, and a dwell angle meter, or may be incorporated into a more comprehensive instrument such as an engine analyser. Self-contained units used to time automotive engines have an inductive pickup that clamps around the proper spark plug wire and serves as the trigger for the strobe. Power for the strobe comes directly from the vehicle's battery. Some older <b>timing</b> <b>lights</b> require {{the removal of the}} spark plug boot in order to attach a direct pickup between the wire's terminal and the centre conductor of the spark plug.|$|R

50|$|Light resets the {{biological}} clock {{in accordance with}} the phase response curve (PRC). Depending on the <b>timing,</b> <b>light</b> can advance or delay the circadian rhythm.

50|$|Setting {{the bomb}} type and trail moves a cam within the unit to a fixed angle. This cam carries several {{electrical}} contacts. As the bomber approaches the target, a metal ridge {{attached to the}} sight rotation shaft depresses the first contact, turning on the drop <b>timing</b> <b>lights.</b> Further motion causes the bombs to release.

50|$|On older engines it {{is common}} to set the {{ignition}} timing using a <b>timing</b> <b>light,</b> which flashes in time with the ignition system (and hence engine rotation), so when shone on the timing marks makes them appear stationary due to the stroboscopic effect. The ignition timing can then be adjusted to fire at the correct point in the engine's rotation, typically a few degrees before top dead centre and advancing with increasing engine speed. The timing can be adjusted by loosening and slightly rotating the distributor in its seat.|$|R
50|$|Timed light {{exposure}} {{can be effective}} to help people match their circadian rhythms with the expected cycle at their destination; it requires strict adherence to <b>timing.</b> <b>Light</b> therapy is a popular method used by professional athletes to reduce jet lag. Special glasses, usually battery-driven, provide light to the eyes, thus inhibiting the production of melatonin in the brain. Timed correctly, the light may contribute to an advance or delay of the circadian phase to that which will be needed at the destination. The glasses may be used on the plane or even before users leave their departure city.|$|R

Traffic congestion wastes a huge portion of the national income for fuel and traffic-related environmental and socioeconomic problems. Computer simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios. It provides an appealing approach to analyze repetitive processes.

Hence, computer simulation can be used effectively to analyze traffic flow patterns and signal <b>light</b> <b>timing.</b> This paper discusses a special-purpose simulation (SPS) tool for optimize traffic signal <b>light</b> <b>timing.</b> The simulation model is capable of optimizing signal <b>light</b> <b>timing</b> at a single junction as well as an actual road network with multiple junctions.

50|$|The <b>timing</b> <b>light</b> is {{connected}} to the ignition circuit and used to illuminate the timing marks on the engine's crankshaft pulley or flywheel, with the engine running. The apparent position of the marks, frozen by the stroboscopic effect, indicates the current timing of the spark in relation to piston position. A reference pointer is attached to the flywheel housing or other fixed point, and an engraved scale gives the offset between the spark time and the top dead centre position of the piston in the cylinder. The distributor can be rotated slightly until the reference pointer aligns with the specified point on the timing scale.|$|R
5000|$|... "Timing advance" [...] {{refers to}} the number of degrees before top dead center (BTDC) that the spark will ignite the air-fuel mixture in the {{combustion}} chamber during the compression stroke. Retarded timing can be defined as changing the timing so that fuel ignition happens later than the manufacturer's specified time. For example, if the timing specified by the manufacturer was set at 12 degrees BTDC initially and adjusted to 11 degrees BTDC, it would be referred to as retarded. In a classic ignition system with breaker points, the basic timing can be set statically using a test light or dynamically using the timing marks and a <b>timing</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R

Related literature and software on Natural Language Processing, in particular textual affect sensing, affective embodied agents, visualisa-tion of 3 D scenes and digital cinematography are reviewed. In relation to other work, SceneMaker will present a genre-specific text-to-animation methodology which combines all relevant expressive modalities.
