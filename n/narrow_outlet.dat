25|$|While its cousin Yosemite Valley to {{the south}} had {{permanent}} Miwok settlements, Hetch Hetchy was only seasonally inhabited. This was likely because of Hetch Hetchy's <b>narrow</b> <b>outlet,</b> which in years of heavy snowmelt created a bottleneck in the Tuolumne River and the subsequent flooding of the valley floor.|$|E
2500|$|Proponents {{of the dam}} {{replied that}} out of {{multiple}} sites considered by San Francisco, Hetch Hetchy had the [...] "perfect architecture for a reservoir", with pristine water, lack of development or private property, a steep-sided and flat-floored profile that would maximize {{the amount of water}} stored, and a <b>narrow</b> <b>outlet</b> ideal for placement of a dam. They claimed the valley was not unique and would be even more beautiful with a lake. Muir predicted that this lake would create an unsightly [...] "bathtub ring" [...] around its perimeter, caused by the water's destruction of lichen growth on the canyon walls, which would inevitably be visible at low lake levels.|$|E

2500|$|Much of the {{stability}} {{achieved by the}} Banzerato was sustained by the constant flow of easy credit from abroad, which was often used on mammoth [...] "white elephant" [...] projects of dubious usefulness but which nonetheless impressed certain sectors of the population. The loans would soon raise Bolivia's external debt to record levels, but proved useful in the manipulation of political patronage. In 1975, Banzer restored diplomatic relations with Chile, broken since 1962, {{with an eye toward}} obtaining an access to the Pacific Ocean, denied to Bolivia since the loss of its maritime coast in the 19th century War of the Pacific. The Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet offered a <b>narrow</b> <b>outlet</b> just north of the port of Arica, on the border with Peru, on lands that had previously belonged to that country. According to the terms of the treaty that handed that territory to Chile, Peru had to agree to any proposal of transferring that land to a third party. Peru refused to accept the Pinochet proposal and instead created its own counter-proposal, which declared Arica and its waters an area of joint-sovereignty between the three nations. Chile refused this proposal and talks with Bolivia ended. Diplomatic relations were once again frozen in 1978.|$|E

60|$|They {{entered the}} gorge and {{he closed the}} willow gate. From rosy, golden morning light they passed into cool, dense gloom. The burros pattered up the trail with little hollow-cracking steps. And the gorge widened to <b>narrow</b> <b>outlet</b> and the gloom {{lightened}} to gray. At the divide they halted for another rest. Venters's keen, remembering gaze searched Balancing Rock, and the long incline, and the cracked toppling walls, but failed to note the slightest change.|$|E
40|$|Water basins with <b>narrow</b> <b>outlets</b> can pre-serve vast {{thicknesses}} of evaporites, {{known as}} salt giants, which {{are thought to}} form when marginal basins or subbasins are {{cut off from the}} main oceanic basin and the water evaporates. Sea salt precipitates and is deposited on the basin floor. They are poten-tial frontiers for challenging research on structural, tectonic, biogenic, and fluid dynamic evolution.

60|$|Father, in shirt sleeves {{rolled up}} to the shoulders, and {{trousers}} rolled up to the knees, {{in the middle of}} the pool, trying to upheave from the bottom a rock larger than himself--if he only knew it! But he doesn't, because it is deeply embedded, therefore he toils on in hope. George building, with turf and stone, a strong embankment with a <b>narrow</b> <b>outlet,</b> to allow the surplus water to escape. Fred, Lucy, Tilly, and Peter cutting turf and carrying stones. Mother superintending the whole, and making remarks. Jacky making himself universally disagreeable, and distracting his mother in a miscellaneous sort of way.|$|E
60|$|His {{good fortune}} {{in the matter of}} game at hand brought to his mind the {{necessity}} of keeping it in the valley. Therefore he took the axe and cut bundles of aspens and willows, and packed them up under the bridge to the <b>narrow</b> <b>outlet</b> of the gorge. Here he began fashioning a fence, by driving aspens into the ground and lacing them fast with willows. Trip after trip he made down for more building material, and the afternoon had passed when he finished the work to his satisfaction. Wildcats might scale the fence, but no coyote could come in to search for prey, and no rabbits or other small game could escape from the valley.|$|E
60|$|Brandt, with {{no thought}} of joining this foolhardy {{attempt to escape}} from the inclosure, ran to the little {{port-hole}} that he might see the outcome. Legget and his five redskins were running toward the <b>narrow</b> <b>outlet</b> in the gorge. The awkward and futile efforts of the Indians to remain behind the shield were almost pitiful. They crowded each other for favorable positions, but, struggle as they might, one or two were always exposed to the cliff. Suddenly one, pushed to the rear, stopped simultaneously with the crack of a rifle, threw up his arms and fell. Another report, differing from the first, rang out. A savage staggered from behind the speeding group with his hand at his side. Then he dropped into the brook.|$|E
60|$|All {{that day}} the wind hung to the southward, and the cutter {{continued}} her course about a league from the land, running six or eight knots the hour in perfectly smooth water. Although the scene had one feature of monotony, the outline of unbroken forest, it was not without its interest and pleasures. Various headlands presented themselves, and the cutter, in running from one to another, stretched across bays so deep as almost to deserve the name of gulfs. But nowhere did the eye meet with the evidences of civilization; rivers occasionally poured their tribute into the great reservoir of the lake, but their banks could be traced inland for miles by the same outlines of trees; and even large bays, that lay embosomed in woods, communicating with Ontario only by <b>narrow</b> <b>outlets,</b> appeared and disappeared, without bringing with them a single trace of a human habitation.|$|R
40|$|Granular {{flows through}} <b>narrow</b> <b>outlets</b> may be {{interrupted}} by the formation of arches or vaults that clog the exit. These clogs may be destroyed by vibrations but have a broad distribution p(τ) of lifetimes τ, a feature which remains elusive. We propose a simple model for arch-breaking, in which the vibrations are formally equivalent to thermal fluctuations in a Langevin equation; the rupture of an arch corresponds to the escape from an energy trap. Using a distribution of trap depths that we infer from experiments, we show that the model captures the empirically observed heavy tails in p(τ). These heavy tails flatten at large τ, consistently with experimental observations under weak vibrations. The trap model also replicates recent results {{on the effect of}} increasing gravity on the statistics of clog formation in a static silo. Therefore, the proposed framework points to a common physical underpinning to the processes of clogging and unclogging, despite their different statistics...|$|R

60|$|For a {{few minutes}} Edith stood with an {{expression}} of perplexity on her bright face; then she began to examine the views from each of the corner windows. This could only be done by peeping through the bullet-hole in the parchment skins that in the meantime did duty for glass. The two windows at the back corners looked out upon the rocky platform, behind which the mountains rose like a wall, so they were rejected; but Edith lingered at one of them, for from it she saw the spring {{at the foot of the}} rock, with its soft bed of green moss and surrounding willow-bushes. From the front corner on the left hand Cross Island and the valley of the river beyond were visible; but from the window on the right the view embraced the whole sweep of the wide river and the <b>narrow</b> <b>outlet</b> to the bay, which, with its frowning precipices on either side, and its bold flanking mountains, seemed a magnificent portal to the Arctic Sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Venters {{had spoken}} of a journey west {{that he and}} his wife meant to take some time. But after the baby came he never {{mentioned}} his wife in connection with the trip. I gathered that he felt compelled to go to clear up a mystery or to find something--I did not make out just what. But eventually, and it was about a year ago, he told me his story--the strangest, wildest, and most tragic I ever heard. I can't tell it all now. It is enough to say that fifteen years before he had been a rider for a rich Mormon woman named Jane Withersteen, of this village Cottonwoods. She had adopted a beautiful Gentile child named Fay Larkin. Her interest in Gentiles earned the displeasure of her churchmen, and as she was proud there came a breach. Venters and a gunman named Lassiter became involved in her quarrel. Finally Venters took to the cañon. Here in the wilds he found the strange girl he eventually married. For a long time they lived in a wonderful hidden valley, the entrance to which was guarded by a huge balancing rock. Venters got away with the girl. But Lassiter and Jane Withersteen and the child Fay Larkin were driven into the cañon. They escaped to the valley where Venters had lived. Lassiter rolled the balancing rock, and, crashing down the narrow trail, it loosened the weathered walls and closed the <b>narrow</b> <b>outlet</b> for ever." ...|$|E
