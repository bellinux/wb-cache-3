5|$|After the {{financial}} success of Final Destination, <b>New</b> <b>Line</b> Cinema contacted Reddick regarding {{plans for a}} sequel.

5|$|By July 2000, {{the film}} was being written for <b>New</b> <b>Line</b> by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, and Tim McCanlies. McCanlies' script used {{the idea of a}} Nick Fury cameo to set up his own film. In June 2001, <b>New</b> <b>Line</b> entered talks with Joss Whedon, a fan of the character, to direct, and in December 2002, McCanlies had turned in a {{completed}} script. In December 2004, the studio attached director Nick Cassavetes to the project for a target 2006 release. Screenplay drafts were written by Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and David Hayter, and pitted Iron Man against his father Howard Stark, who becomes War Machine. After two years of unsuccessful development, and the deal with Cassavetes falling through, <b>New</b> <b>Line</b> Cinema returned the film rights to Marvel.|$|E

5|$|In 1910 the new Bicester {{cut-off line}} of the GWR Chiltern Main Line opened, {{allowing}} trains from London to Birmingham to bypass a long curve through Oxford.

5|$|<b>New</b> <b>Line</b> {{believed}} Freddy vs. Jason {{needed a}} fresh start, and choose a new actor for Jason.

Hodder did receive the script for Freddy vs. Jason, and had a meeting with director Ronny Yu and <b>New</b> <b>Line</b> executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason. According to Hodder, <b>New</b> <b>Line</b> failed to provide him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films. Yu and development executive Jeff Katz recognized the outcry among fans over the replacement of Hodder as Jason, but stood by their choice in recasting.|$|E
