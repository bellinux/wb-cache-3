The {{study found that}} ILUC effects offset part of the emission benefits, and that above the 5.6% threshold, ILUC emissions increase rapidly increase. For the expected scenario of 5.6% by 2020, the study estimated that biodiesel production increases would be mostly domestic, while bioethanol production would take place mainly in Brazil, regardless of EU duties. The analysis concluded that eliminating trade barriers would further reduce emissions, because the EU would import more from Brazil. Under this scenario, [...] "direct emission savings from biofuels are estimated at 18 Mt , additional emissions from ILUC at 5.3 Mt [...] (mostly in Brazil), resulting in a global <b>net</b> <b>balance</b> of nearly 13 Mt [...] savings in a 20 years horizon.

The difference between these mechanisms is called <b>net</b> protein <b>balance.</b> When positive, the <b>net</b> protein <b>balance</b> favors increases in muscle mass, i. e., muscle hypertrophy. The effect of resistance training on <b>net</b> protein <b>balance</b> can persist up to 48 h [1]. In addition, any nutritional modification that could increase protein accretion in the muscle would maximize resistance training effects by enhancing muscle anabolism. In particular, it has now been well demon-strated that protein consumption after exercise shifts the balance in favor of muscle protein synthesis [2]. Composition of supplements may play a key role in influencing <b>net</b> protein <b>balance</b> since previous studies have revealed that only essential amino acids could stimu-late muscle protein synthesis [3].

Unfortunately, studies often neglect this input path due to methodological difficulties in the determination.

The aim of this study is to compare these results with discharge rates estimated by inverse modelling of heat transport using temperature profiles measured in lake bed sediments. We were able to show a correlation between the fluxes obtained with the different methods, although the time scales of the methods differ substantially. As a consequence, we conclude that the use of hydraulic head data and meteorologically-based groundwater <b>net</b> <b>balances</b> to estimate LGD is limited to time scales similar to the calibration period...|$|R

Proceedings, International Symposium on Snow Science Sep 03 - 07, 2007 Moscow, RUSSIAThe {{spatial and temporal}} variability of seasonal snow cover in glacierized catchments {{has important implications for}} the <b>net</b> mass <b>balance</b> of alpine glaciers. This study examines the relationship between changing snowpack volume, the resulting winter <b>balance</b> and the <b>net</b> mass <b>balance</b> of Storglaci?ren, northern Sweden. Using a conceptual model, the net seasonal snow input to the glacier is simulated daily for 16 years from 1990. From this the annual snow accumulation and winter balance are calculated. The model outputs are compared with snowlines delineated from classified aerial photographs, ASTER and Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery, and with measured Storglaci?ren winter balances. The results of the model indicate variability in the winter balance over the study period, though there is a slightly negative trend overall. The highest winter balances and seasonal snow volumes occurred in the early 1990 s and correspond with positive <b>net</b> mass <b>balances.</b> However, the slightly negative trend in winter <b>balance</b> and decreased <b>net</b> seasonal snow volumes suggested by the model, combined with the measured increasing trend in mass lost due to ablation, have resulted in decreasing glacier <b>net</b> mass <b>balances</b> and a corresponding rise in ELA over the study period.
