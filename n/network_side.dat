In this article, I focus on the ethical question of getting informed consent when we collect data from social network sites (SNS). I argue that data from SNS are not per se public and research based on these data should not be exempt from the ethical standard that informed consent must be obtained from participants. Based {{on the concept of}} privacy in context (Nissenbaum,), I further propose that this is because the norms of distribution and appropriateness are violated when researchers manipulate online contexts and collect data without consent. Finally, I make suggestions for existing and possible future practices for large-scale online studies...|$|R

On top of that network operators and regularities have come to the realization that assigned spectrum bands are not utilized as they should be. Cognitive radio stands out as a candidate technology to address many emerging issues in MNGN such as capacity, quality of service and spectral efficiency. As a transmission strategy, cognitive radio systems depend greatly on sensing the radio environment. In this paper, we present a novel approach for interference characterization in cognitive radio networks based on wideband chirp signal. The results presented show that improved sensing accuracy is maintained at tolerable system complexity. Remittanc...|$|R
5000|$|If {{there is}} a fault on the primary feeder, the {{substation}} circuit-breaker is meant to open, disconnecting the primary feeder from one side. The problem is that this primary cable is also connected to a network transformer, which is interconnected to other network transformers on its secondary side. The secondary network will energize the primary feeder through the network transformer. This can be very dangerous, because a fault {{will continue to be}} 'fed' from the secondary <b>network</b> <b>side</b> of transformer. Even without a fault, if the electric utility wants to perform maintenance on that primary cable, they must have a way to fully disconnect that primary cable, without worrying about the cable being energized by the secondary network through the network transformer. Thus, the network protector is designed to open its contacts if the relay senses backwards flowing current.|$|E
50|$|It is {{very much}} in the {{interest}} of the network operator to use the allocated spectrum as efficiently as possible and to the highest possible capacity because most of the investment is done to get the licence for it. It would be desirable to have the frequency reuse of one, which means that each cell can operate in the same frequency. This in turn creates interference to the users operating in nearby places. Increase Interference causes voice quality to drop and may cause call drop. It is now a well known fact that it is possible to cancel the interference at the mobile handset side by changing the baseband software without changing anything in the <b>network</b> <b>side.</b> SAIC-enabled mobiles can work in high interference levels. SAIC-enabled mobiles need even less transmit power from the network which in turn reduces the interference in the network. Studies shows that the speech quality gain can be about 6% at a SAIC mobiles penetration of 10%, about 37% at a SAIC mobiles penetration of 50%, about 99% at a SAIC mobiles penetration of 100%.|$|E
30|$|This article investigates this challenge, by {{addressing}} the dynamic resource {{management of the}} network nodes that serve the control plane signalling coming from the mobile devices. A key question is {{what happens with the}} huge amount of control plane data that are generated to the <b>network</b> <b>side.</b> Inevitably, {{there is a need to}} handle the generated control plane signalling/decision-making requests efficiently, alleviating the network management burden and optimising the utilisation of the respective system resources. In this work, two types of mobile devices are considered in our system: reconfigurable and autonomous ones. The differentiation among them lies in their decision-making capabilities. Reconfigurable mobile devices simply produce decision-making requests to the <b>network</b> <b>side,</b> whereas autonomous mobile devices are able to specify a first set of alternatives that are then communicated to the <b>network</b> <b>side</b> for validation. To this end, a lightweight management mechanism of the decision-making requests is proposed, which allows for their specialised administration according to the type of originating mobile device.|$|E
