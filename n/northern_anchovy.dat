5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was {{a major cause of}} decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy.</b> Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds.

40|$|The use of {{historical}} fishing records to understand relationships between climatic change and fish abundance {{is limited by}} the relatively short duration of these records, and complications due to the strong influence of human activity in addition to climatic change. Sedimentary records containing scales, bones or geochemical proxies of variability in fish populations provide unique insights on long-term ecosystem dynamics and relationships with climatic change. Available records from Holocene sediments are summarized and synthesized. The records are from several widespread locations near or along the continental margins of the South Atlantic and Pacific oceans, including Alaska, USA (Pacific salmon), Saanich and Effingham Inlets, British Columbia, Canada (pelagic fish), Santa Barbara Basin, California, USA (<b>Northern</b> <b>anchovies</b> and Pacific sardines), Gulf of California, Mexico (Pacific sardines, <b>Northern</b> <b>anchovies</b> and Pacific hake), Peru upwelling system (sardines, anchovies and hake). and Benguela Current System, South Africa (sardines, anchovies and hake). These records demonstrate that fish population sizes are not constant, and varied significantly over a range of time scales prior to the advent of large-scale commercial fishing. In addition to the decadal-scale variability commonly observed in historical records, the long-term records reveal substantial variability over centennial and millennial time scales. Shifts in abundance are often, but not always, correlated with regional and/or global climatic changes. The long-term perspective reveals different patterns of variability in fish populations, as well as fish-climate relationships, than suggested by analysis {{of historical}} records. Many records suggest prominent changes in fish abundance at ca. 1000 - 1200 AD, during the Little Ice Age, and during the transition {{at the end of the}} Little Ice Age in the 19 th century that may be correlative, and that were likely driven by major hemispheric or global reorganizations in the earth's climate system. Additional sedimentary records of marine fish abundance and corresponding paleoenvironmental conditions are likely to further enhance our understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics.

Samples derived from the same depths that proved ideal to induce first feeding prior to the storm no longer contained the necessary phytoplankton varieties and abundances; as a result, the young larvae did not feed on the post-storm samples and were unable to survive. Thus, Lasker eventually hypothesized that high-energy events that cause destratification of ocean layers have negative impacts on first-feeding <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> larvae by destabilizing and decreasing their prey availability.|$|E

40|$|The central California {{coast is}} a highly productive, biodiverse region that is {{frequently}} affected by the toxin-producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Despite the consistent presence of A. catenella along our coast, very {{little is known about}} the movement of its toxins through local marine food webs. In the present study, we investigated 13 species of commercial finfish and rock crabs harvested in Monterey Bay, California for the presence of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and compared them to the presence of A. catenella and PSTs in sentinel shellfish over a 3 -year period. Between 2003 and 2005, A. catenella was noted in 55 % of surface water samples (n =  307) and reached a maximum concentration of 17, 387 cells L− 1 at our nearshore site in Monterey Bay. Peak cell densities occurred in the month of July and were associated with elevated shellfish toxicity in the summers of 2004 and 2005. When A. catenella was present, particulate PSTs were detected 71 % of the time and reached a maximum concentration of 962  ng STXeq L− 1. Of the 13 species tested, we frequently detected PSTs in Pacific sardines (Sardinops sagax; maximum 250  μg STXeq 100  g− 1), <b>northern</b> <b>anchovies</b> (Engraulis mordax; maximum 23. 2  μg STXeq 100  g− 1), brown rock crabs (Cancer antennarius; maximum 49. 3  μg STXeq 100  g− 1) and red rock crabs (C. productus; 23. 8  μg STXeq 100  g− 1).

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade the {{consumption}} of planktivorous <b>northern</b> <b>anchovies</b> containing the diatom-produced neurotoxin, domoic acid (DA), {{has been responsible for}} severe neurologic illness and mass mortality events involving hundreds of sea birds and marine mammals in Monterey Bay, California. This research characterizes the dynamics of DA transfer, accumulation, and neurotoxicity in this pivotal and dangerous DA vector fish species.  Chapter one documents aDA-poisoning event in which dozens of California sea lions {{died as a result of}} consuming DA-contaminated anchovies in Monterey Bay.  DA levels in sea lion feces and anchovies were attained using HPLC-UV and microplate receptor binding assays, with absolute confirmation by tandem mass spectrometry. The presence of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia frustules in sea lion feces and anchovy gut contents was determined using scanning electron microscopy. Chapter two presents data from an intracoelomic injection study in which anchovies were shown to be neurologically susceptible to DA excitotoxicity and to have a similar sensitivity to the toxin as mammals. Excitotoxic symptoms are described and conrum that DA crosses the blood brain barrier in fish.  Chapter three characterizes the dynamics of DA accumulation in small planktivorous fish in relation to ecologically relevant toxic diatom densities. Toxic Pseudo-nitzschia densities and DA levels in anchovies and sardines were measured from samples collected weekly throughout Monterey Bay from 10 / 8 / 99 to 10 / 8 / 00. DA levels in fish were estimated via HPLC-UV and toxic cell densities were determined via whole cell hybridization with species-specific large subunit rRNA-targeted fluorescent probes. DA levels accumulated in fish viscera tracked toxic cell densities in surface waters confirming that anchovies and sardines regularly consume toxic diatoms when present in Monterey Bay. Fish viscera DA levels harmful to piscivorous predators occurred when toxic cell densities exceeded 104 cells liter - 1. Anchovies accumulated more DA than sardines in viscera, however neither species appears to accumulate significant levels of toxin in body tissue. Finally, Appendix A includes results from histologic examination of brain sections taken from control and DA-intoxicated anchovies and stained with haemotoxylin and eosin dyes.

40|$|The Humboldt {{current system}} {{is one of}} the most {{productive}} ecosystems of the planet, due to the horizontal advection of nutrients, and the large scale coastal upwelling induced by winds blowing predominantly towards the equator (Bernal et al., 1983). The average Chilean fish landings in the past ten years is about 5. 5 million tons per year and the pelagic fishery of <b>northern</b> Chile (mainly <b>anchovy</b> and sardine) represent about 42 % (SERNAPESCA, 1951 - 2005). The anchovy fishery is closely associated with fishing effort changes and environmental fluctuations such as cold-warm regime shifts (interdecadal fluctuations), El Niño events (interannual fluctuations), and coastal trapped waves (intra-seasonal fluctuations) (Yáñez et al., 2005). It collapses during the El Niño event in 1972 - 73 while a remarkable increase in sardine landings is observed (warm period); after 1985 (cold period), the anchovy fishery present a notorious recovery as the sardine landings decreases (Yáñez et al., 2003). A problem associated with ecosystemic information is the complexity and non-linear behaviour, the variability of species, composition and abundance, affected directly by environmental changes, and also affected by the presence of predators, competitors and parasites.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 <b>Northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis mordax) are a {{dominant}} forage {{fish in the}} California Current large marine ecosystem (CCLME). However, {{little is known about}} <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> abundance, distribution, age structure, or population fluctuations relative to ocean conditions in the eastern boundary upwelling system off the U.

This thesis includes three primary studies of <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> in the CCLME off Oregon and Washington using data collected during four National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) surveys (1977 - 2006) : inter- and intra-annual variation in anchovy distribution and its relationship to oceanography, growth rates of larval and juvenile anchovy that indicate the timing of major spawning events and changes in mortality rates, and analysis of whole lipids and fatty acid profiles to determine food sources in years of contrasting oceanographic conditions. First, I quantified the relationship between <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> abundance with environmental variables at two spatial and temporal scales: 1) mesoscale, including sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS), density (SSD), chlorophyll a, distance from shore, and depth; and 2) macroscale, including Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index, Multivariate El Niño Southern Oscillation Index, timing of the Spring Transition, and abundance of cold-water zooplankton. Anchovy densities increased significantly from 1999 - 2004, and decreased significantly from 2005 - 2006. SST and proximity to shore were the most consistent parameters explaining anchovy distribution. Year-class strength was highly correlated with, and presumably driven by, the abundance of cold-water copepods. Second, I characterized recruitment for <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> by conducting microstructure analysis of saggital otoliths from late larval and juvenile life history phases collected in September 2006. I identified a protracted spawning period for <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> ranging from June-August 2006. Juveniles that were spawned and hatched early in the summer 2006 had higher growth rates, but smaller back-calculated sizes-at-age during the larval phase, when compared to congeners spawned later that summer. Finally, I determined total lipid content and fatty acid signatures of <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> and three other forage fish species during two contrasting periods of oceanographic conditions (summers of 2005 and 2006) : Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific herring (Clupea harengus pallasii), and whitebait smelt (Allosmerus elongatus). Forage fish lipid levels were lowest in 2005 and increased in 2006. Fatty acid biomarkers in 2005 indicated that the food web was based mainly on dinoflagellates, corroborating observations of delayed coastal upwelling and low primary productivity in the CCLME.

40|$|Fish {{spotters}} are {{pilots in}} small aircraft employed by commercial fishermen to locate, identify, estimate the size of, and direct boats toward pelagic fish schools. Data describing species, location, {{and size of}} schools can be inexpensively obtained from fish spotters but are difficult to interpret statistically. We developed an index of relative abundance from fish spotter data based on extended delta-lognormal models and applied the method to data for <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis mordax). In contrast with previous approaches, our method used all available data, provided an index for <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> that was proportional to abundance, and explicitly modeled factors (pilots, regions, seasons, and time of day) that affected observations by fish spotters. We also included information about mixed layer depth and sea surface temperature in models for a reduced study area and found that envi-ronmental data, where available, {{can be used to}} improve estimates of relative abundance from fish spotter data. Simulation results indicated that our approach is a cost-effective way to improve biomass estimates for pelagic species like <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy.</b> Les observateurs de poissons sont des pilotes de petits avions employes par des pecheurs commerciaux pour localiser, identifier, evaluer la taille et diriger les bateaux vers les bancs de poissons pelagiques.

40|$|The {{mortality}} rates of Pacific sardine, Sardinops sagax caerulea, larvae (< 20 d) increased during 1951 - 67, and this increase {{was positively correlated}} with the increase in biomass of <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy,</b> Engraulis mordax. Other potential correlates with larval sardine {{mortality rates}} were examined using multiple correlation. These included temperature and zooplankton volumes at stations positive for sardine larvae, water column stability, upwelling, transport, salinity anomalies, and Pacific mackerel, Scomber japonicus, abundance. None contributed signifi-cantly to the multiple regression with anchovy abundance. Thus, no evidence existed for either Lasker’s stable ocean hypothesis of larval mortality or Hjort‘s larval transport hypothesis. The logarithm of the ratio of sardine recruits at age 2 to the spawning biomass was used as an index of recruitment success. Sardine recruitment success at age 2 was not correlated with larval mortality rates. Sardine recruitment, however, was negatively correlated with both <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> biomass and the combined biomass of Pacific sardine, Pacific mackerel, and <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy.</b> A plausible explanation for this result is that predation by pelagic fishes results in greater mortality rates of sardine larvae and juveniles which in turn decrease sardine recruitment.

40|$|Abstract. -Since 1982, {{declines in}} the U. S. {{reduction}} fishery for <b>northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> Engraulis mordux were due to ex-vessel prices too low to meet opportunity costs of traditional crew members in the southern California wetlish fleet, rather than to inability to meet variable (short-run) costs for items such as fuel. The decline of the fishery appeared to be driven largely by opportunity costs, which, in turn, depended on the ethnic background of crew members. Our analysis indicated that opportunity costs and sociological factors, which are often ignored by fishery managers who tra-ditionally focus on biological analyses, can affect a fishery and its performance. Estimates of opportunity and variable costs from our study should be useful {{in the development of}} management plans for the wetfish fishery. The central population ofnorthern anchovy En-graulis mordax ranges from about San Francisco, California, south to Punta Baja, Baja California, Mexico. <b>Northern</b> <b>anchovy</b> have been harvested by U.
