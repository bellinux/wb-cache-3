500|$|Reception to Hair {{upon its}} Broadway premiere was, with exceptions, {{overwhelmingly}} positive. [...] Clive Barnes {{wrote in the}} New York Times: [...] "What is so likable about Hair...? [...] I think it is simply {{that it is so}} likable. [...] So new, so fresh, and so unassuming, even in its pretensions." [...] John J. O'Connor of The Wall Street Journal said the show was [...] "exuberantly defiant and the production explodes into every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> of the Biltmore Theater". Richard Watts Jr. of the New York Post wrote that [...] "it has a surprising if perhaps unintentional charm, its high spirits are contagious, and its young zestfulness makes it difficult to resist." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Europa and the Pirate Twins" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} by Peter Buckley, in his book The Rough Guide to Rock, as [...] "showcas Dolby's trademark combination of the charming and the gimmicky". Writing for Allrovi, Stewart Mason described the song as [...] "a hyperactive synth pop classic", whose [...] "every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> is stuffed with some sort of ear-grabbing hook". Mason added that the song [...] "pack a remarkable amount of detail into two short verses and a bridge" [...] and [...] "resolves with a soaring, bittersweet chorus". Writing about the song's music video, Dennis Shin of PopMatters described Dolby as being on the [...] "leading edge" [...] in the medium, highlighting the videos for [...] "She Blinded Me with Science" [...] and [...] "Hyperactive!" [...] in addition to describing that for [...] "Europa and the Pirate Twins" [...] as being [...] "one of his lesser-known and unsung videos".|$|E
500|$|Many of D'Angelo's peers {{have noted}} {{the success of the}} [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] music video as a {{contributing}} factor to his period of absence from the music scene and solo work, as well as his legal controversies and drinking issues following the tour. A columnist for SoulBounce.com has cited the video as the [...] "jump-the-shark moment" [...] for D'Angelo, and stated [...] "It was so provocative and polarizing that no one could recover from it, least of all him". Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson, who served as producer for Voodoo and musical director for [...] "The Voodoo Tour", discussed the music video's impact on D'Angelo in a 2003 interview with music journalist Touré, stating [...] "he wants is to get fat. He doesn’t want his braider braiding every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> of his hair. He doesn’t wanna have to have ripples in his stomach. He doesn’t want the pressure of being 'Untitled' the video". Questlove ended by stating [...] "Had he known what the repercussions of 'Untitled' would've been, I don’t think he would've done it".|$|E

50|$|The kapitan's {{mansion in}} Macau was {{apparently}} even {{bigger than the}} Kuala Lumpur residence. It was long and deep, with countless rooms, <b>nooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>crannies,</b> <b>and</b> so large that many sections were perpetually dim as they had no access to natural light.|$|R
500|$|Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a television series that necessitated over twelve months of filming, was cast as Lucius Vorenus, one of the lead characters. McKidd said, [...] "What was different about this show is you get 14 months to really get into every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> of the character, {{in a way you}} don't get a chance to explore when you do a movie or a theater play. Initially, it was a terrifying prospect. But once you got over that, you realize what a great opportunity it was." [...] Heller described his character as [...] "very much a Roman of the Old School, a stoic man devoted to duty and religion and the legion." [...] Ray Stevenson played Titus Pullo, a soldier who befriends Vorenus. McKidd said that [...] "they're kind of thrown together by fate, by chance, but somewhere along the line they start to stick... keep finding themselves accidentally at the epicenter of tumultuous events and immense change, so they're kind of clinging to each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|That same year, the Leisure Circle {{published}} Christopher Jones' book No. 10 Downing Street, The Story of a House. In the foreword, [...] Thatcher {{described her}} feelings for Number 10: [...] "How much I {{wish that the}} public... could share with me the feeling of Britain's historic greatness which pervades every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> of this complicated and meandering old building... All Prime Ministers are intensely aware that, as tenants and stewards of No. 10 Downing Street, they have in their charge {{one of the most}} precious jewels in the nation's heritage".|$|E
2500|$|When {{the team}} left Ann Arbor on Thursday evening, {{a large crowd}} {{gathered}} at the station. [...] Coach Yost spoke briefly, assuring the crowd that the team was [...] "ready for anything the Buckeyes offer." [...] The day before the game, The New York Times published a story about speculators asking $15 for $2.50 seats, adding, [...] "Columbus is preparing for the greatest influx of football enthusiasts the city has ever entertained." [...] Although {{the capacity of the}} new stadium was 63,000, temporary bleachers were erected along the sidelines and [...] "into every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> of the big structure. [...] Reports of the crowd size ranged from 72,000 to 80,000.|$|E

50|$|Quite early on, Celts, Romans and Franks {{settled the}} land where Wintrich would later stand. Wintrich had its first {{documentary}} mention in AD 960. the Celtic-Roman name vindriacum meant “Winemaking Village”; there has been winegrowing here since days of yore. Timber-frame houses, lanes with little <b>nooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> <b>and</b> old wineries {{bear witness to the}} historic tradition.|$|R
2500|$|Observations of MUD-play show {{styles of}} play {{that can be}} roughly categorized. Achievers focus on {{concrete}} measurements of success such as experience points, levels, and wealth; Explorers investigate every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> of the game, and evaluate different game mechanical options; Socializers devote most of their energy to interacting with other players; {{and then there are}} Killers who focus on interacting negatively with other players, if permitted, killing the other characters or otherwise thwarting their play. Few players play only one way, or play one way all the time; most exhibit a diverse style. [...] According to Richard Bartle, [...] "People go there as part of a hero's journeya means of self-discovery".|$|E
2500|$|... …Significant too is {{that from}} the early 1800s the Finnish seamen sailing these ships had journeyed {{up and down the}} North and South American coasts. Salt, used by the Company in {{preserving}} pelts, was obtained on islands in Baja California. Fort Ross in Bodega Bay, just north of San Francisco, was a stop on that route until 1841 when the fort was sold to the [...] "swindler" [...] Johann Sutter, on whose land the first California Gold was found. Thus, all Finnish seamen plying these waters knew every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> on these shores. Similarly they knew equally well the coast on the Asiatic side. Returning to Finland on their mandatory around-the-world journeys, they spread the news of the riches they had seen.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, after {{reviewing}} company documents about Midland Works, a T {{public relations officer}} wrote: [...] "I hope very much indeed that we are never called upon to discuss Armley in the public arena." [...] In 1978, however, Leeds City Council informed T that the factory was still [...] "badly contaminated" [...] with asbestos, with dust found in the basement, lift shaft, roof, ventilation shafts and beneath the floors. Hessian sacks containing asbestos fibre were still present, and the yard was filled with 'a few hundred tonnes' of blue asbestos waste mixed with soil. R.D. Lunt, T's Safety and Environment manager, wrote of the factory basement: [...] "Every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> has asbestos fibre in it". T contributed £15,000 towards the clean-up of the factory, and claimed they were doing so out of [...] "a moral, not a legal responsibility" [...] to do so. The surrounding houses and buildings {{were not included in}} this operation, and Leeds City Council and T [...] "agreed to keep the whole matter 'low-key' if approached by the media," [...] while a T internal memo stated [...] "The Principal Inspector of Factories and the Assistant Director of Environmental Health are anxious to play this down and have given us considerable support." ...|$|E
50|$|As midnight {{came and}} went, {{a river of}} charged {{particles}} and electrons in the ionosphere flowed from west to east, inducing powerful electrical currents in the ground that surged into many natural <b>nooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>crannies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lake's {{shoreline}} measures {{more than}} 40 miles, and considerably more if one includes {{all of the}} <b>nooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> of the numerous inlets. Most of this shoreline is public land, and is therefore undeveloped.|$|R

[...] "But every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> of {{our brain}} {{was so full}} of {{subjects}} that we simply could not give this a moment's consideration, and we see that all the other editors in New York were obliged to turn the cold shoulder to it, though they must have felt, as we did, that it was of prime importance." ...|$|E

50|$|Benthic fish, which {{rest on the}} seafloor, {{physically}} hide {{themselves by}} burrowing into sand or retreating into <b>nooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>crannies,</b> or camouflage themselves by blending into the background or by looking like a rock or piece of seaweed.|$|R
60|$|Martin Eden {{came back}} to earth. His was a fluid organism, swiftly adjustable, capable of flowing into and filling all sorts of <b>nooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>crannies.</b> With the policeman's hail he was {{immediately}} his ordinary self, grasping the situation clearly.|$|R
60|$|The {{scientific}} {{men were}} discreet. They let him alone. But they privily examined his bunk. It {{was lined with}} hardtack; the mattress was stuffed with hardtack; every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> was filled with hardtack. Yet he was sane. He was taking precautions against another possible famine--that was all. He would recover from it, the scientific men said; and he did, ere the Bedford's anchor rumbled down in San Francisco Bay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Taking {{advantage}} of these moments, the ship had been moved cautiously nearer the shore. It was useless to remain out in such thick weather. Her officers knew every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> of the coast along their beat. They thought {{that she would be}} much better in a certain cove. It wasn't a large place, just ample room for a ship to swing at her anchor. She would have an easier time of it till the fog lifted up.|$|E
60|$|Then they, too, {{began to}} look under the leaves and under the bark. They pawed around in the grass, they hunted in every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny,</b> but not a nut could they find. They were tired and cross and hot and they accused Billy Mink of having hidden the nuts. Billy Mink stoutly insisted {{that he had not}} hidden the nuts, that he had not found the nuts, and when they saw how hard he was hunting they {{believed}} him.|$|E
50|$|The akhada culture {{subsequently}} {{flourished in}} Bengal and the Bengali Hindu elite were drawn into it.

25|$|The {{hospital}} {{buildings have}} been used on many occasions as a film or television location due to the proximity to several TV and film studios, Victorian prison-like architecture, lots of external <b>nooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>crannies</b> <b>and</b> during the 1980s and 1990s plenty of empty ward space.

6000|$|Only a small keg of biscuit {{remained}} to them. This was soon expended, {{and then the}} process of absolute starvation began. Every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny</b> of the boat was searched {{again and again in}} the hope of something eatable being found, but only a small pot of lard--intended probably to grease the tackling--was discovered. With a dreadful expression in their eyes some of the men glared at it, and there would, no doubt, have been a deadly struggle for it if the mate had not said, [...] "Fetch it here," [...] in a voice which none dared to disobey.|$|E
60|$|There {{never was}} an uglier man than Carrier, with that long hatchet-face of his, those {{abnormally}} high cheekbones, that stiff, lanky hair, that drooping, flaccid mouth and protruding underlip. Nature {{seemed to have}} set herself the task of making the face a true mirror of the soul--the dark and hideous soul on which of a surety Satan had already set his stamp. But he is dressed with scrupulous care--not to say elegance--and with a display of jewelry the provenance of which is as unjustifiable {{as that of the}} works of art which fill his private sanctum in every <b>nook</b> <b>and</b> <b>cranny.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} {{specifically}} designed to work dockside tramways and was ordered by the Eastern Region of British Railways {{to carry out this}} work.
