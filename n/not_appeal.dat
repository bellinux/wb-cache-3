On September 26, Parish Attorney Walters announced that the prosecution would <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> the appellate ruling, but would try Bell as a juvenile. Bell was released on $45,000bond, subject to electronic monitoring and under the supervision of a probation officer.|$|E

On that date, Hastert reported to the Federal Medical Center, Rochester in Minnesota to begin his prison term.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Disney {{executives}} {{wanted to}} set the film in contemporary times, out of concern that a period piece might <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> to a large audience. Bilson and DeMeo argued {{that the success of}} the Indiana Jones trilogy proved that ticketgoers would enjoy an adventure film set in the 1930s, and the studio finally agreed.|$|E

5|$|After eight years, Soeprapto was honourably {{dismissed}} on 1 April 1959. {{the dismissal}} {{has been reported}} in several sources {{to be related to the}} acquittal of/dropping of charges against two foreigners, Junschlager and Schmidt, who had been accused of undermining the government; Junschlager died in prison, and Schmidt was freed on basis of time served in a high court decision which the prosecution did <b>not</b> <b>appeal.</b> As he had not been given prior warning he was unable to go to Merdeka Palace for the related formalities; at the time he was visiting his parents in Yogyakarta. His wife later noted that this led to him becoming disillusioned in President Sukarno's regime.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1922 midterm congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and the Republicans {{had followed}} through {{on many of}} their campaign promises. But some of the fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well-off, did <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over {{the outcome of the}} strikes. From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not survive to meet.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June {{the court}} acquitted nine medics and {{downgraded}} sentences against nine others. Ali Al-Ekri {{was sentenced to}} five years imprisonment, another doctor to three years and seven were given from one month to one year. Two other doctors did <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> their sentences of 15 years' imprisonment, instead fleeing the country. On 1 October, the Court of Cassation, the country's highest court, closed the first case involving twenty medics by upholding jail sentences on the remaining nine. Although the verdict is final, activist Mohamed al-Maskati said that they could still be pardoned by the king.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August, {{the central}} {{government}} decided not {{to intervene in the}} suspension of Nagpal, as she did <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> or challenge the suspension order given by the Uttar Pradesh government. Since Nagpal's suspension on 27 July, the Centre had issued three reminders to the UP government, seeking a detailed report. On 4 August, the UP government had sent a report on Nagpal's suspension to the DoPT and had served a chargesheet to Nagpal, which deemed her actions as unwarranted and in violation of rules.|$|E
5|$|The American music {{industry}} {{is dominated by}} large companies that produce, market, and distribute certain kinds of music. Generally, these companies do not produce, or produce in only very limited quantities, recordings in styles that do <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> to very large audiences. Smaller companies often fill in the void, offering {{a wide variety of}} recordings in styles ranging from polka to salsa. Many small music industries are built around a core fanbase who may be based largely in one region, such as Tejano or Hawaiian music, or they may be widely dispersed, such as the audience for Jewish klezmer.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendants}} did <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> to the U.S. Supreme Court, and {{the time}} for filing such an appeal lapsed on March 22, 1976. After Judge Gignoux's decision became final, the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot gained federal recognition in 1976, thus becoming eligible for $5 million/year in housing, education, health care, and other social services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Further, the Interior Department's Solicitors Office began looking into whether and how it should proceed in United States v. Maine.|$|E

5|$|United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins (520 F.3d 976) is a 2008 {{decision}} of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concerning civil forfeiture in admiralty law. Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for a three-judge panel that ordered that the shark fins be returned to their owners, reversing {{a decision by the}} Southern District of California. The government did <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> the case further.|$|E
5|$|Youtsey, who {{received}} a life sentence, did <b>not</b> <b>appeal,</b> but after two years in prison, he turned state's evidence. In Howard's second trial, Youtsey claimed that ex-governor Taylor had discussed an assassination plot with Youtsey and Howard. He backed the prosecution's claims that Taylor and Powers worked out the details, he acted as an intermediary, and Howard fired the shot. On cross examination, the defense pointed out contradictions {{in the details of}} Youtsey's story, but Howard was still convicted. Youtsey was paroled in 1916 and was pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{directed}} {{and starred in}} White Hunter Black Heart (1990), an adaptation of Peter Viertel's roman à clef, about John Huston {{and the making of}} the classic film The African Queen. Shot on location in Zimbabwe in the summer of 1989, the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $8.4million. Later in 1990, Eastwood {{directed and}} co-starred with Charlie Sheen in The Rookie, a buddy cop action film. Critics found the film's plot and characterization unconvincing, but praised its action sequences. An ongoing lawsuit, in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman's car, resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991. Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant's legal fees if she did <b>not</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1922 Rabi {{returned}} to Cornell {{as a graduate}} chemistry student, and began studying physics. In 1923 he met, and began courting, Helen Newmark, a summer-semester student at Hunter College. In order to be near her when she returned home, Rabi continued his studies at Columbia University, where his supervisor was Albert Wills. In June 1924 Rabi landed {{a job as a}} part-time tutor at the City College of New York. Wills, whose specialty was magnetism, suggested that Rabi write his doctoral thesis on the magnetic susceptibility of sodium vapor. The topic did <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> to Rabi, but after William Lawrence Bragg gave a seminar at Columbia about the electric susceptibility of certain crystals called Tutton's salts, Rabi decided to research their magnetic susceptibility, and Wills agreed to be his supervisor.|$|E
5|$|In fact, Puccini was {{at first}} less than {{enthusiastic}} about the idea for this comic opera– Florence as a setting did <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> to him, and he feared the public would have {{little interest in the}} subject. However, he soon became interested, and did some work on the piece even while composing Suor Angelica. The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to Gianni Schicchi, although the war news and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{light was}} again poor {{on the fourth}} day, but England did <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> against it. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} to erase the deficit and build a lead, to force Australia to chase a target on an erratic surface if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket. Bradman thought that rain might come, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensive leg theory so England {{would not be in}} the lead should a sticky wicket arise. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the game}} {{involved}} two Canadian teams, the NHL {{hoped that the}} event would prove a successful draw in the U.S. To that end, the league scheduled the Heritage Classic as {{the only game in}} prime time, while NBC debuted its Hockey Day in America with a pair of regional doubleheaders that led into the telecast; throughout NBC's telecast, commercials advised viewers to change to Versus for the Heritage Classic once the American games finished. University of Alberta sports economist Brad Humphreys questioned the league's ambitions, arguing that a game without an American team would <b>not</b> <b>appeal.</b> He stated that the game was being held to placate the Canadian audience, but noted that it was important for the NHL to keep the league's Canadian audience happy.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, {{the light}} was again poor, but England did <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> to the umpires for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} in order to eradicate the deficit and build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress {{in the hope that}} the hosts would not have a lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless {{the light was}} so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen. In foggy and misty conditions, Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes. Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.|$|E
5|$|Increasing {{economic}} success allowed Busch to visit Wiedensahl more frequently. Busch {{had decided to}} leave Munich, as only few relatives lived there, and the artists' association was temporarily disbanded. In June 1867 Busch met his brother Otto for the first time, in Frankfurt. Otto {{was working as a}} tutor to the family of a wealthy banker and industrialist, Kessler. Busch became friends with Kessler's wife, Johanna, a mother of seven and an influential art and music patron of Frankfurt. She regularly opened salons at her villa, frequented by artists, musicians and philosophers. She believed Busch to be a great painter, a view supported by Anton Burger, a leading painter of the Kronberger Malerkolonie, the Kronberg-based group of painters. While his humorous drawings did <b>not</b> <b>appeal</b> to her, she supported his painting career. At first she established an apartment and studio for Busch in her villa, later providing him with an apartment nearby. Motivated by Kessler's support and admiration, and introduction to the cultural life of Frankfurt, the 'Frankfurter Years' were the most artistically productive for Busch. At this time he and Otto discovered the philosophical works of Arthur Schopenhauer.|$|E
50|$|In an {{adversarial}} system, appellate courts do {{not have}} the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it. Therefore, if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner, or against legal precedent, that judgment will stand if <b>not</b> <b>appealed</b> - even if it might have been overturned on appeal.|$|R
