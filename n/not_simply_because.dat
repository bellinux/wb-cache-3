5|$|According to Jainism, {{the purpose}} of nonviolence is {{not because it is}} a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> its {{observance}} is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path.|$|E
5|$|Idiots and lunatics {{had their}} land looked after by a court-appointed administrator, and any profits {{went into a}} trust fund to support the insane person. Due to the vested {{interest}} of the King (who would hold the lands) the actual lunacy or idiocy was determined by a jury, not by an individual judge. Under the Lunacy Act 1845 the Lord Chancellor {{had a right to}} appoint a commission to investigate the insanity of an individual; as part of his role as Keeper of the King's conscience, however, he would only do this when it was beneficial to the lunatic, <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> somebody had been found insane.|$|E
25|$|Medieval Europe bred large horses {{specifically}} for war, called destriers. These horses were {{the ancestors of}} the great heavy horses of today, and their size was preferred <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> {{of the weight of}} the armor, but also because a large horse provided more power for the knight's lance. Weighing almost twice as much as a normal riding horse, the destrier was a powerful weapon in battle.|$|E

Criteria are <b>not</b> met <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> a person has mental illness, appears to have mental problems, takes psychiatric medication, or has an emotional outburst. Criteria are <b>not</b> met <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> a person refuses voluntary examination. Criteria are not met if there are family members or friends that will help prevent any potential and present threat of substantial harm.|$|R
25|$|Many of {{the legends}} are {{interconnected}} in the Bhagavata. The text asserts that gods (Deva), demons (Asuras) {{and human beings}} do things, and behave in good or evil ways, in part, because of their past experiences and their innate evolving natures (Guṇa). The evil behavior of demon king Hiranyakasipu in Book 7, for example, against his own son Prahlada for his Bhakti for Vishnu, is <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> of demonic Tamasic Guṇa but also because Vishnu in his Varaha avatar had killed Hiranyakasipu's brother Hiranyaksa in Book 2. Hiranyakasipu turned vengeful against Vishnu ever since then, and had refused to consider whether Hiranyaksa deserved to die.|$|E
25|$|Further {{interwoven}} {{into the}} plays of Plautus {{and just as}} common {{as the use of}} proverbs is the use of Greek within the texts of the plays. J. N. Hough suggests that Plautus's use of Greek is for artistic purposes and <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> a Latin phrase will not fit the meter. Greek words are used when describing foods, oils, perfumes, etc. This is similar to the use of French terms in the English language such as garçon or rendezvous. These words give the language a French flair just as Greek did to the Latin-speaking Romans. Slaves or characters of low standing speak much of the Greek. One possible explanation for this is that many Roman slaves were foreigners of Greek origin.|$|E
500|$|Although Hart and Ciannelli's dub script remains {{relatively}} {{faithful to}} the original Italian dialogue, the meaning of numerous lines and scenes were changed; Ciannelli in particular frequently embellished the dialogue of films in the dubbing stage, such as Arizona Colt. Much of the dialogue concerning the outlaws, such as a remark made by Walter, {{the leader of the}} bandits, about their forthcoming amnesty, as well as Loco's conversation with Burnett about the morality of the thieves, were rewritten to imply that most of the outlaws were being persecuted <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> of their poverty, but for also practising Mormonism. Several of the characters' names were also changed from Corbucci's originals, for example, [...] "Tigrero" [...] became [...] "Loco", [...] "Sheriff Gideon Corbett" [...] changed to [...] "Sheriff Gideon Burnett", and [...] "Bobo Schultz" [...] was renamed [...] "Sanchez".|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} after Disraeli's death, as Salisbury began his reign of {{more than twenty years}} over the Conservatives, the party {{emphasised}} the late leader's [...] "One Nation" [...] views, that the Conservatives at root shared the beliefs of the working classes, with the Liberals the party of the urban élite. Disraeli had, for example, stressed the need to improve the lot of the urban labourer. The memory of Disraeli was used by the Conservatives to appeal to the working classes, with whom he was said to have had a rapport. This aspect of his policies has been re-evaluated by historians in the 20th and 21st centuries. In 1972 BHAbbott stressed that it was not Disraeli but Lord Randolph Churchill who invented the term [...] "Tory democracy", though it was Disraeli who made it an essential part of Conservative policy and philosophy. In 2007 Parry wrote, [...] "The tory democrat myth did not survive detailed scrutiny by professional historical writing of the 1960s [...] demonstrated that Disraeli had very little interest in a programme of social legislation and was very flexible in handling parliamentary reform in 1867." [...] Despite this, Parry sees Disraeli, rather than Peel, as the founder of the modern Conservative party. The Conservative politician and writer Douglas Hurd wrote in 2013, [...] " [...] was not a one-nation Conservative—and this was <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> he never used the phrase. He rejected the concept in its entirety." ...|$|E
2500|$|Russians {{may view}} Circassian {{nationalism}} extremely fearfully and suspiciously, <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> it claims {{a chunk of}} what Moscow considers its territory, but because, just {{as was the case}} with Chechnya, the Baltics, and so on, nationalist movements may result in the loss of the previous prestige and dominance by ethnic Russians, a stigmatization of the Russian language, and the re-establishment of native dominance (hence, the [...] "South Africa" [...] syndrome).|$|E

2500|$|Von Meck {{remained}} a devoted supporter of Tchaikovsky {{and all his}} works, but her bond with him depended on not meeting him. [...] This was <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> he would {{not live up to}} her expectations.

2500|$|Hazlitt {{goes on to}} note {{his belief}} that Gifford shows such narrowness in his reviews <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> he is a {{political}} tool, but because he really cannot understand literary originality.

He inclines, by a natural and deliberate bias, to the traditional in laws and government; to the orthodox in religion; to the safe in opinion; to the trite in imagination; to the technical in style; to whatever implies a surrender of individual judgment into the hands of authority, and a subjection of individual feeling to mechanic rules." ...|$|E

All the other necessary conditions were present, the legendary material, the heroic society, the Court minstrels, all-- except the great poet.
