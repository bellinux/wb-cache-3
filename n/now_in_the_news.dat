The idea came in to do a project with The Buena Vista Social Club to fuse their Latin sounds with Western artists and their familiar popular songs. The project evolved when more environmental disasters struck—the Asian Earthquakes and Hurricane Katrina. But the big picture was climate change. You can call these natural disasters but after all the research and scientific data, we know that we're at least partly to blame {{for some of these}} disasters. Global warming is <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> daily. If we don't act in the time frame our experts give us, our grandchildren will curse us eternally." ...|$|E
40|$|Long {{after the}} {{political}} uprisings in the Middle East have subsided, many underlying challenges {{that are not}} <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> will remain. Prominent among these are rapid population growth, spreading water shortages, and ever growing food insecurity. In some countries, grain production is now falling as aquifers are depleted. After the Arab oil-export embargo of the 1970 s, the Saudis realized that since they were heavily dependent on imported grain, they were vulnerable to a grain counter-embargo. Using oil-drilling technology, they tapped into an aquifer far below the desert to produce irrigated wheat. In a matter of years, Saudi Arabia was self-sufficient in wheat, its principal food staple. But after more than 20 years of wheat self-sufficiency, the Saudis announced in January 2008 that this aquifer was largely depleted {{and they would be}} phasing out wheat production. Between 2007 and 2010, the wheat harvest of nearly 3 million tons dropped by more than two thirds. At this rate the Saudis likely will harvest their last wheat crop in 2012 and then be totally dependent on imported grain to feed their Canada-sized population of nearly 30 million people...|$|E

40|$|Although {{traditional}} {{news services}} {{have made some}} of their products available online since the early 1990 s {{the changes that have}} taken place in this arena {{over the past few years}} has been phenomenal. Distributing news online has a significant impact on <b>the</b> traditional <b>news</b> cycle, <b>the</b> business model of <b>news</b> corporations, <b>the</b> work of journalists and the role of traditional <b>news</b> consumers among <b>the</b> general public. <b>In</b> addition to <b>the</b> online presence of <b>the</b> traditional <b>news</b> media, entirely new online news websites are emerging outside the mainstream media ownership, allowing both professional and amateur journalists a global forum for individual reports and opinions. In this paper, we revisit the results of the first phase of a longitudinal study of online news, conducted two years ago and compare those results with the current state of affairs. The most dramatic change that we are <b>now</b> witnessing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> industry is <b>the</b> emergence of citizen journalism together with the trend to the convergence of <b>the</b> roles of <b>news</b> producers and news consumers. Here we describe and discuss the lessons learn...|$|R
40|$|Communication now {{is easier}} than ever before. One {{consequence}} {{of this is the}} emergence of virtual communities, unconstrained by physical proximity. We perform two investigations into changing social trends. We study a corpus of 100 years of newspaper articles {{to see if we can}} find evidence to support the popular intuition that as news cycles have sped up, the public's attention span has gotten shorter. We find no such evidence: to the contrary, we find that the typical length of time that a person's name stays <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> has not changed over time, and celebrities <b>now</b> stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> for longer than ever before. We also investigate a new kind of community on Twitter called a group chat, where members have regular meetings to discuss a broad range of topics, from medical conditions to hobbies. We find that the phenomenon is growing over time, and paint a broad picture of the topics which one could find a group chat to discuss. With a view to helping connect new participants to group chats they may not have been able to find or might not have been aware of, we design an algorithm to rank group chats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of a topic given as a query...|$|R
500|$|The death certificate, {{signed by}} Macklin, gave the cause as [...] "Atheroma of the Coronary arteries and Heart failure"—in modern terms, {{coronary}} thrombosis. Later that morning, Wild, <b>now</b> <b>in</b> command, gave <b>the</b> <b>news</b> to <b>the</b> shocked crew, {{and told them}} that the expedition would carry on. The body was brought ashore for embalming before its return to England. On 19 January, Leonard Hussey accompanied the body on board a steamer bound for Montevideo, but on arrival there he found a message from Lady Shackleton, requesting that the body be returned to South Georgia for burial. Hussey brought the body back to Grytviken, where Shackleton was buried on 5 March <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian cemetery. Quest had meantime sailed, so only Hussey of Shackleton's former comrades was present at the interment. A rough cross marked the burial site, until it was replaced by a tall granite column six years later.|$|R
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{past fifteen}} years, language, {{ideology}} {{and power of}} <b>the</b> <b>news</b> articles of two prominent international news websites, namely Aljazeera English (AJE) and CNN has been a controversial topic. The current study explores intertextuality and its function <b>in</b> reproducing <b>the</b> underlying ideology and power relations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> articles on Palestinian-Israeli conflict <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> Websites of AJE and CNN. The study adopted Fairclough’s (1995) approach to CDA, the Three Dimensional Framework, to examine the use and functions of intertextuality in 6 news articles of AJE and CNN. The study focuses on intertextuality, specifically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inclusion and exclusion of <b>the</b> “voices” <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> articles through <b>the</b> use of direct and indirect reporting of speech. A Critical Discourse Analysis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> articles of AJE and CNN reveals how <b>the</b> producers of <b>news</b> articles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> websites construct and incorporate the various voices for ideological purposes. The study demonstrates that the way writers incorporated <b>the</b> voices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> articles using <b>the</b> direct and indirect reported speech {{is found to be}} loaded with ideological bias. The study reveals that there is a relationship between the way writers report the voices of others <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> articles and <b>the</b> objectives of the writers which clearly show the relationship between language, ideology and power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new articles of AJE and CNN. The study suggests that the issue of intertextuality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> articles on to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict published <b>in</b> <b>the</b> international <b>news</b> Websites of AJE and CNN needs to be explored and examined in a broader political context which <b>the</b> <b>news</b> articles are embedded...|$|R
