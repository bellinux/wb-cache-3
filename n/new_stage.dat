5|$|A <b>new</b> <b>stage</b> {{adaptation}} of the show debuted in 2003. Based on Clarke's novel The Moonbather, the play was first performed by the Scunthorpe Little Theatre Club from 7 to 11 October 2003. Using new actors to perform the roles of Compo, Clegg, and Foggy, the play featured the trio as they attempted {{to get to the}} bottom of the disturbance created by a near-naked man in the town. The play was later performed in Eastbourne by Eastbourne Theatres from 15 July 2009 to 8 August 2009 before touring the country through November 2009.|$|E
5|$|Cairano was {{undoubtedly}} {{affected by this}} period of sudden and profound decay, if {{only because of the}} sharp decline in commissions. After a decade of intense activity with several overlapping projects, a <b>new</b> <b>stage</b> in his career began, one which is obscured from the documentary view. The last relevant document in this regard is the contract for the entrance to the Duomo of Chiari in 1513, while the next document, in 1517, states that Cairano was already dead. Apart from this, there are other works from the period attributed to him, including the complex question of the completion of the Martinengo mausoleum.|$|E

On 4 July the siege entered a <b>new</b> <b>stage,</b> with Austrian reinforcements arriving, and the besieging force growing from 8,000 to 40,000. The Austrians were commanded by Hungarian general Baron Pal von Kray, an artillery expert. Artillery bombardment was constant.

5|$|The present theatre complex, {{designed}} by Peter Moro, {{was completed in}} 1972. The 1903 entrance building was demolished, as {{were a number of}} surrounding buildings and, more controversially, the stage area of the 1766 theatre. A <b>new</b> <b>stage</b> and fly tower were built along with technical facilities and offices. The 150 seat New Vic Studio (now the Studio) theatre was built in place of the old entrance, and the Coopers' Hall provided the theatre with the grand façade and foyer area it had previously lacked.|$|E
5|$|Walpole's {{works have}} not been {{completely}} neglected in recent years. The Herries stories have seldom been out of print, and in 2014 WorldCat listed a dozen recent reissues of Walpole's works, including The Wooden Horse, The Dark Forest, The Secret City, Jeremy, and The Cathedral. In 2011 the BBC broadcast a reappraisal of Walpole, The Walpole Chronicle, presented by Eric Robson. In 2013 a <b>new</b> <b>stage</b> version of Rogue Herries was presented by the Theatre by the Lake company in Walpole's adopted home of Keswick. The BBC speculated that this could mark a revival in interest in his works.|$|E

5|$|For another episode for {{the series}} filmed in New York City he {{was asked by the}} NYPD not to pre-announce the performance, as crowd control for some Angel {{performances}} had become a concern for the police. This trick saw Angel hanging his feet, while bound with two straitjackets and a noose around his neck which were attached to metal weights. While he was successful in the trick, Angel tore his shoulder muscles and this required surgery in January 2014. This resulted in the temporary closing of the Believe stage show between January and April 2014, while he was recovering from the surgery and returning to performance shape. He did however host a <b>new</b> <b>stage</b> show featuring other magicians between February and March 2014 in lieu of performing in his own show. Clips from the show also became the most watched YouTube magic clips {{in the history of the}} site, with more than 15 million views.|$|E
5|$|Formby {{began to}} develop his own stage act during the 1890s, and built a large fan base in Lancashire. He devised several {{characters}} with their own costumes, and composed a series of comic songs. By 1896 his assignment book records that he was buying and collecting comic songs and securing the singing rights. He was billed as J.H. Booth until 1897, when he changed his stage name to George Formby. Although rumoured to have picked his new surname after seeing it as a destination on a railway carriage, the main sources agree this story {{is likely to be}} apocryphal. The origin of the Formby name is {{more likely to have been}} a suggestion from Dennis Clarke, the manager of the Argyle Theatre in Birkenhead, while George was chosen in honour of the music hall star George Robey. Formby first used his <b>new</b> <b>stage</b> name in Birkenhead in 1897.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a showcase for visual improvements, Lost Coast acted as a testbed for Valve's commentary system. When the feature is enabled, additional items appear in the game that can be interacted with to play an audio commentary. Each audio piece ranges from ten seconds to a minute of commentary. Players hear the developers {{talk about what the}} player is seeing, what is happening, why they made certain decisions, and what kinds of challenges they faced. Commentary tracks are represented by floating speech bubbles called commentary nodes. Valve intended for players to first play the level with commentary disabled, and after completing the level, play it again with commentary enabled, learning about each <b>new</b> <b>stage</b> as they progress. The company has since made the commentary system standard in all of its later video games.|$|E

5|$|In his {{theoretical}} writings, particularly Imperialism, Lenin discussed what {{he regarded}} as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it {{had reached a}} <b>new</b> <b>stage,</b> state monopoly capitalism. He also believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, that monopoly capitalism existed in Russia meant {{that the country was}} sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism. Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism, and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its liberationist vision. It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.|$|E
5|$|Multiple others {{participated in}} the {{production}} of the ceremony. Musicians Hans Zimmer and Pharrell Williams composed new music exclusive to the Oscars ceremony, which was later released as an album via the iTunes Store.

On May 2, 2012 it was announced that WildCat would be removed before opening day to expand Celebration Plaza and bleachers were added in its spot. A new concession area with patio seating was built on the left side of the control booth. During the show, a portion of the patio is blocked off as a V.I.P. seating area known as the Pepsi Fan Zone. In addition, a beer garden was added behind the control booth, to the left of the bleachers.|$|E

25|$|It {{is because}} this process takes this dialectical form, {{in which each}} <b>new</b> <b>stage</b> is created through the further differentiation, integration, and {{synthesis}} of new structures out of the old, that the sequence of cognitive stages are logically necessary rather than simply empirically correct.
