No significant enhancement of the radiation effect was observed with ICRF 159.

For Ro- 07 - 0582 and metronidazole, several concentrations were investigated, and the interval between injection with Ro- 07 - 0582 and irradiation was varied: an interval of 30 min gave more sensitization than an interval of 90 min. The results from the local control experiments using Ro- 07 - 0582 have been compared with those obtained from regrowth delay experiments. The radiosensitization obtained by the Ro- 07 - 0582 increased with the X-ray dose above 25 gray. Both metronidazole and Ro- 07 - 0582 gave significant enhancement effect at serum concentrations which can be achieved in man...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria (Serratia marcescens) and {{mammalian}} cell (Chinese hamster V 79 - 379 A) were irradiated in monolayers with ultraviolet light at 254 nm or 365 nm {{in the presence}} or absence of radiosensitizing drugs. At 254 nm, killing is very efficient (D 37 approximately 1 J m- 2 exposure, or approximately 6 x 10 (4) photons absorbed by DNA per bacterium), and sensitizers have no effect. At 365 nm, cells are not killed in buffer, but are inactivated in the presence of <b>nifurpipone</b> or misonidazole. Lethal exposures (approximately 5 x 10 (3) J m- 2 at 10 micrometer misonidazole) correspond to about 10 (7) photons absorbed by sensitizer molecules per bacterium. Toxicity of stabel photoproducts of the drugs is not involved, nor is oxygen required. Hence the transient species formed by photo-excitation of radiosensitizer molecules are capable of killing cells in the absence of other types of radiation damage...|$|E
