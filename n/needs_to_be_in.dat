5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E

25|$|Stress {{analysis}} is generally concerned with objects and structures {{that can be}} assumed to be in macroscopic static equilibrium. By Newton's laws of motion, any external forces are being applied to such a system must be balanced by internal reaction forces, which are almost always surface contact forces between adjacent particles — that is, as stress. Since every particle <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> equilibrium, this reaction stress will generally propagate from particle, creating a stress distribution throughout the body.|$|E

25|$|Direct imaging {{can give}} only loose {{constraints}} of the planet's mass, which {{is derived from the}} age of the star and the temperature of the planet. Mass can vary considerably, as planets can form several million years after the star has formed. The cooler the planet is, the less the planet's mass <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>In</b> some cases it is possible to give reasonable constraints to the radius of a planet based on planet's temperature, its apparent brightness, and its distance from Earth. The spectra emitted from planets {{do not have to be}} separated from the star, which eases determining the chemical composition of planets.|$|E
25|$|Most {{igniters}} in {{gas turbine}} applications are electrical spark igniters, similar to automotive spark plugs. The igniter <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the combustion zone where the fuel and air are already mixed, {{but it needs}} to be far enough upstream so that it is not damaged by the combustion itself. Once the combustion is initially started by the igniter, it is self-sustaining and the igniter is no longer used. In can-annular and annular combustors (see Types of combustors below), the flame can propagate from one combustion zone to another, so igniters are not needed at each one. In some systems ignition-assist techniques are used. One such method is oxygen injection, where oxygen is fed to the ignition area, helping the fuel easily combust. This is particularly useful in some aircraft applications where the engine may have to restart at high altitude.|$|E
25|$|Anthocyanins are {{phenolic}} compounds {{found throughout the}} plant kingdom, being frequently responsible for the blue to red colors found in flowers, fruits and leaves. In wine grapes, they develop during the stage of veraison when the skin of red wine grapes changes color from green to red to black. As the sugars in the grape increase during ripening so does the concentration of anthocyanins. In most grapes anthocyanins are found only in the outer cell layers of the skin, leaving the grape juice inside virtually colorless. Therefore, to get color pigmentation in the wine, the fermenting must <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> contact with the grape skins {{in order for the}} anthocyanins to be extracted. Hence, white wine can be made from red wine grapes {{in the same way that}} many white sparkling wines are made from the red wine grapes of Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier. The exception to this is the small class of grapes known as teinturiers, such as Alicante Bouschet, which have a small amount of anthocyanins in the pulp that produces pigmented juice.|$|E

25|$|The {{software}} distribution {{of a product}} can be done offline as well as online. In an offline situation the package is a physical package which contains all the elements. The software is stored on a data carrier such as a CD or a DVD, and the documents might also be stored in a digital form on this data carrier, or they might be in physical form such as a booklet. The package {{as a whole is}} a physical product. In an online situation the entire package <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a digital form. The consequences on the distribution process are described in the following paragraphs. CCU is designed to fit both situations but as bandwidth is growing it is making more sense to distribute especially updates and new versions to existing customers online. In this article both ways are discussed. In the process-data model it is assumed that the software vendor conducts both distribution channels. As a practical example: HISComp, a provider of medical information systems distributes its software straightforward via CDs. However they use their website to distribute patches for the software products.|$|E

Like Tony's suits, it's shiny and polished. But this time, there's nobody inside... This movie has neither the emotionalism of the first film, nor the flashy villains of the second... Tony's relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts is in inexplicable jeopardy—and then simply fixes itself. A supposedly cute kid sidekick—a true sign of authorial desperation—is introduced, and then dropped." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune echoed this, saying, [...] "n a gleefully cynical bid for a preteen audience (a few years too young for the violence in Iron Man 3, I'd say), Stark befriends a bullied 8-year-old [...] (Ty Simpkins) who becomes his tag-along and sometime savior... Stark no longer <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the Iron Man suit. He's able to operate the thing remotely when needed. The movie's like that too. It's decent superhero blockbustering, but rather remote and vaguely secondhand. At this point, even with Black's flashes of black humor, the machinery {{is more or less}} taking care of itself, offering roughly half of the genial wit and enjoyment of the first Iron Man." ...|$|E

Even though two employees in different departments have a top-secret clearance, they must have a need-to-know in order for information to be exchanged. Within the {{need-to-know principle}}, network administrators grant the employee least amount privileges to prevent employees access and doing more than what they are supposed to. Need-to-know helps to enforce the confidentiality-integrity-availability (C‑I‑A) triad. Need-to-know directly impacts the confidential area of the triad.|$|E

2500|$|Luke Davies of The Monthly {{applauded the}} film for recreating [...] "the atmosphere, {{the sense of}} hope and battle; even the sound design, bustling with street noise, adds much vibrancy to the tale", but voiced criticisms {{in regard to the}} message of the film, stating [...] "while the film is a {{political}} narrative in a grand historical sense, the murder of Milk is neither a political assassination nor an act of homophobic rage. Rather, it is an act of revenge for perceived wrongs and public humiliation," [...] Davies continues to postulate that [...] "It seems as likely that Milk would have been murdered were he heterosexual. So the film can't be the heroic tale of a political martyr it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> order to hold us and take our breath away. It's a simpler story, about a man who fought an extraordinary political fight and who was killed, arbitrarily and unnecessarily." [...] Although Davies found Penn's portrayal of Milk moving, he adds that [...] "on a minor but troubling note, there are times when Penn's version of 'gay' acting veers dangerously close to a twee version of his childlike (read: 'mentally retarded') acting in I Am Sam." [...] All his criticisms aside, Davies concludes that [...] "the heart of the film– and while it is not perfect, it is uplifting– lies in Penn's portrayal of Milk's generosity of spirit.|$|E
