500|$|Burnet {{was only}} briefly in New Hampshire during his short tenure, where unlike Massachusetts he was readily granted a salary {{for three years}} or the {{duration}} of his administration. [...] At {{the time of his}} appointment to the Massachusetts seat, the province had been governed {{for a number of years}} by Lieutenant Governor William Dummer, acting for Governor Samuel Shute. [...] Burnet made a hardnosed attempt to force the Massachusetts assembly to grant him a permanent salary. [...] Since the institution of the royal charter in 1692, the assembly had steadfastly resisted this, choosing instead to make periodic grants to the governor. [...] Local politicians found this an effective mechanism for influencing the governor to approve their policies, since the governor would <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> the next grant would be made, or how large it would be. [...] The salary matter was one of many that had vexed Governor Shute during his time in the province. Dummer, a wealthy Massachusetts native, had been more conciliatory, only insisting that control of the provincial militia remain in his hands.|$|E

According to Wickman, the lyrics of the song refer to mortality and [...] "the urgency of spending time with the ones you love before you lose them, because you <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> that could be"; this {{is shown in the}} hook lines, [...] "Baby kiss me / Before they turn the lights out / You better kiss me / Before our time has run out." [...] A similar interpretation was voiced by Douglas Wolk of Wired, who challenged the notion of the sample being simply a [...] "trivialization", instead describing it as [...] "a swift, understated and brutal reminder that everything can go horribly wrong before anyone understands what's happening, and that the light could be extinguished at any moment". Wickman concluded, [...] "If there's anything anyone should know by now about Beyoncé Knowles, it's that there's nothing in her self-presentation that isn't carefully chosen." ...|$|E

Bozell said [...] "this lying, slacker Jesus is even dumber than Peter, the greatest idiot on animated television today."

[...] Retrieved on January 18, 2010. [...] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. [...] According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, [...] "the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. [...] We've known what we were going to do for a couple years now and there's been a tremendous amount of work setting up the premise so it would work." [...] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, [...] "We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season [...] "were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. [...] We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too." [...] Cuse has also stated, [...] "We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [...] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning." [...] Cuse further explained that the new narrative [...] "doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series", keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that [...] "you really don't have to have seen the show [...] [...] There will be stuff that will go completely over your head for sure, but because of the way that they're telling this last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion." [...] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. [...] Lindelof finally conceded that [...] "by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will have pretty much all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [...] end." [...] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with [...] "Trust us." [...] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, [...] "We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. [...] The problem with alternative realities is that you <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> the rug is going to be pulled out from under you. [...] We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. [...] Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! [...] But we're ANTI-paradox.
