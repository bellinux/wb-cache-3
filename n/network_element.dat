Both statistical and counting methods give a mean lifetime of <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> of 50 h. The <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> are divided into two categories according to their evolution: 'breakup' and 'merging'. They have similar average lifetimes. We also find {{that the number of}} the elements that disappear by merging is about twice that by breakup.

5000|$|In {{terms of}} the network {{management}} model, a network management station (NMS) is one that executes network management applications (NMAs) that monitor and control <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> (NE) such as hosts, gateways and terminal servers. These <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> use a management agent (MA) to perform the network management functions requested by the network management stations. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used to communicate management information between the network management stations and the agents in the <b>network</b> <b>elements.</b> NMS is described in RFC 1157 [...] "A Simple Network Management Protocol".|$|R

40|$|Passive {{membrane}} {{properties of}} neurons, {{characterized by a}} linear voltage response to constant current stimulation, were investigated by busing a system model approach. This approach utilizes the derived expression for the input impedance of a network, which simulates the passive properties of neurons, to correlate measured intracellular recordings with the response of network models. In this study, the input impedances of different network configurations and of dentate granule neurons, were derived {{as a function of}} the <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> and were validated with computer simulations. The parameters of the system model, which are the values of the <b>network</b> <b>elements,</b> were estimated using an optimization strategy. The system model provides for better estimation of the <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> than the previously described signal model, due to its explicit nature. In contrast, the signal model is an implicit function of the <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> which requires intermediate steps to estimate some of the passive properties...|$|R
