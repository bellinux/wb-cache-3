He was also <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> the grappling aspects of MMA, but the UFC rebuffed his suggestion {{to change the rules}} of the sport to accommodate striking. Hecht credits Kevin Kay and his editorial collaboration with the UFC for highlighting the show's story lines, which he believes helped drive its ratings success.|$|E

Johnny's instructions to C.J. when preparing for his first live performances with the group were to play facing the audience, to stand with the bass slung low between spread legs, and to walk forward {{to the front of}} stage {{at the same time as}} he did. Johnny was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> guitarists who performed facing their drummer, amplifier, or other band members.|$|E
5|$|Through the Wilderness is {{a tribute}} album with {{contributions}} {{from a variety of}} artists dedicated to American singer Madonna. It was released on November 27, 2007 by Los Angeles-based Manimal Vinyl Records. According to label head Paul Beahan, the idea for the album was conceived by him in a dream. He enlisted multiple artists to work on the project, including Giant Drag, Lavender Diamond, Winter Flowers and Chapin Sisters. Although <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> Madonna, Beahan wanted to see how her songs would sound when covered by different musicians.|$|E

5|$|When Harry Dean Stanton {{auditioned for}} Brett, he told Ridley Scott he was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> science-fiction or horror films; Scott {{replied that he}} was not either, but {{expected}} Alien to do well. According to Stanton, he was pleased with the film and said it and Pretty in Pink are the films for which he is best recognized. Several of Brett's scenes were deleted from the original cut, including Ripley and Parker seeing his death and his cocooned corpse in the Alien's lair; they were included in the 2003 director's cut. According to writer Dan O'Bannon, the latter scene hinted that Brett's body was becoming an Alien incubator.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{advancement}} in 2049 {{is not based}} on merit or politics alone, rather executives can issue challenges to each other which are held on highways emptied of cars and usually fought to the death, in a fashion similar to Mad Max, a source cited as inspiration by the author in the acknowledgements of the book. Chris Faulkner gains recognition and small celebrity for a particularly brutal win over a much older and more seasoned member of his firm, from which he is head-hunted by Shorn to join their team. Within the media landscape, business executives have fame on the order of sports stars or movie actors and their driving duels are analysed and covered as sporting events. Chris' wife Carla is also his mechanic, a vital role where an executive's car is the difference between promotion and death. She is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> the way he makes his living, but they have an initially strong relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} Clamp had some {{difficulty}} adjusting from their typical style after deciding to publish with Weekly Shōnen Magazine. Because their typical thinner lines {{did not give}} the desired impact, Ohkawa expressed the group's desire to make their lines thicker, and to use simpler layouts similar to the other stories already present in Shōnen Magazine. She stated that they used their original artistic style to attract initial readers and then slowly transitioned to a new style. Sometime around when the story arc focused on the Country of Ōto took place, their art style had gradually been changing again; at this point they were thinking of returning to their original style. They were still adjusting to a weekly schedule; many of their previous works were on a monthly schedule. Sugawara expressed concerns about the strain on the artists of concurrently doing a weekly issue of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle linked with xxxHolic, {{but in the end}} he whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The main idea was connecting these two series was to have protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and designs. However, during the ending they would be stated to share the same existence, and had to go on different paths. As Tsubasa is connected with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar; Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style which leads to the characters have longer limbs. When asked if another series influenced Tsubasa in the concept of parallel worlds, Ohkawa replied that she was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> sci-fi series and pointed that all worlds shown in the series were other works from Tsubasa. At the same time, she wanted to segregate Tsubasa from previous works. She also explained that while some characters are the same, their traits and personalities were modified due to different backstories.|$|E

25|$|Chan {{created his}} screen persona as a {{response}} to the late Bruce Lee and the numerous imitators who appeared before and after Lee's death. Lee's characters were typically stern, morally upright heroes. In contrast, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular men, often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends, or families, who always triumph in the end despite the odds. Additionally, he has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the opposite of Lee's: where Lee held his arms wide, Chan holds his tight to the body; where Lee was loose and flowing, Chan is tight and choppy. Despite the success of the Rush Hour series, Chan has stated that he is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> it, since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie nor understands American humour.|$|E
25|$|Miguel was 20 {{years old}} when he first {{challenged}} the liberal institutions established after the 1820 revolution, which may have been part of a wider strategy by the queen. He was {{at the head of the}} counter-revolution of 1823, known as the Vilafrancada, which erupted on May 27, 1823 in Vila Franca de Xira. Early in the day, Miguel joined the 23rd Infantry Regiment, commanded by Brigadier Ferreira Sampaio (later Viscount of Santa Mónica) in Vila Franca, where he declared his support for an absolutist monarchy. He immediately called on General Pampluna (later Marquis of Subserra) to join him and his cause. The general, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> the liberal constitution, obeyed his summons and within five days he controlled the insurrectionary forces. The prince, supported by the queen, went so far as to demand the abdication of the king, who, faithful to his earlier oath, wanted to maintain the 1822 Constitution, despite the growing support for absolutist forces in Vila Franca.|$|E
500|$|Prefix writer Craig Hubert {{rated the}} album 5 out of 10, {{and said it}} had more [...] "definable hooks" [...] than most other metal albums, but that still made the record no better or more accessible.

Speaking from his perspective as an aged listener and someone who is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> modern rock music, Jay Bennett of the Phoenix New Times gave the album a grade of B. He described the album as “a pleasant surprise”, saying that he was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>fan</b> <b>of</b> metal from recent years but that the album has “a lot more in common with the late-‘70s and early-‘80s-era Judas Priest and Iron Maiden”, which he liked.|$|E
