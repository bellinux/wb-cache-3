40|$|<b>Nano-satellites</b> {{represent}} {{a new generation}} of satellite platforms that is opening its own market niche expanding extremely quickly. These satellites are small and light, thanks to their cubic shape they are also modular and have raised the interest of space operators thanks to their jack-in-the-box concept. Particularly interesting is the Earth Observation and remote sensing segment, that has large potential applications for safety issues, or even more practical applications for agriculture. The possibility of using a constellation or a network of <b>nano-satellites</b> as {{a new generation of}} telecommunication (e. g. for mobile applications) or navigation systems seems also very appealing for the next future. Besides the advantages of using <b>nano-satellites,</b> this type of space missions still presents a number of technical issues; one of these is the on-board telecommunication system that, working at low frequencies, provides a very limited data rate preventing the transmission of large amounts of data. Only by improving this system, <b>nano-satellites</b> can become real science space missions...|$|R

40|$|ISBN: 9781628410228 International audienceSince {{the launch}} of the first {{artificial}} satellite in 1957, more than 6, 000 satellites have been sent into space. Despite technological advances, the space domain remains little accessible. However, with the miniaturization of electronic components, it has recently become possible to develop small satellites with which scientific goals can be addressed. Micro-satellites have demonstrated that these goals are achievable. However, completion times remain long. Today, we hope through the use of <b>nano-satellites</b> to reduce size, costs, time of development and accordingly to increase accessibility to space for scientific objectives. <b>Nano-satellites</b> have become important tools for space development and utilization, which may lead to new ways of space exploration. This paper is intended to present a future space mission enabled by the development of <b>nano-satellites</b> and the underlying technologies they employ. Our future mission expands observations of the Sun (total solar irradiance and solar spectral irradiance measurements) and of the Earth (outgoing long-wave radiation, short-wave radiation measurements and stratospheric ozone measurements). Constellations of <b>nano-satellites</b> providing simultaneous collection of data over a wide area of geo-space may be built later and present a great interest for Sun-Earth relationships...|$|R

40|$|NanoSat {{technology}} has opened Earth orbit to extremely low-cost science missions through a common interface that provides greater launch accessibility. A natural {{question is the}} role that CubeSat-derived NanoSats could play to increase the science return of deep space missions. We do not consider single instrument <b>nano-satellites</b> as likely to complete entire Discovery-class missions alone, but believe that <b>nano-satellites</b> could augment larger missions to significantly increase science return. The key advantages offered by these mini-spacecrafts over previous planetary probes is the common availability of advanced subsystems that {{open the door to}} a large variety of science experiments, including new guidance, navigation and control capabilities. In this paper, multiple NanoSat science applications are suggested that could take advantage of these features. We also address the significant challenges and questions that remain as obstacles to the use of <b>nano-satellites</b> in deep space missions.

40|$|It {{seems very}} likely that {{missions}} with <b>nano-satellites</b> in professional scientific or commercial applications will not be single-satellite missions.

The OLFAR radio telescope will be composed of an antenna array based on <b>nano-satellites</b> orbiting the moon to shield the receiving nodes from terrestrial interference. The array will receive frequencies in a band from around 30 kHz to 30 MHz. This frequency band is scientifically very interesting, since it will be able to detect signals originating from the yet unseen “Dark Ages” ranging from the Big Bang until around 400 million year after. Another science driver is the LF activity from (exo) planets. In this paper the design parameters for the satellites and the swarm will be given and status of the OLFAR project will be reported.

40|$|Earth-based radio {{astronomy}} is currently limited to frequencies of 30 MHz and higher, {{due to the}} influence of the ionosphere and Earth-based man-made interference. In order to breach this barrier, a space-based radio-telescope is required. This radio telescope is quite an impressive device, as a baseline of 100 km is required in order to achieve sufficient resolution, hence the most viable option would be to distribute this system into separate antennas. These can be combined, into a single virtual instrument. OLFAR’s approach [1] to this problem is to use a swarm of self-managed, self-organising <b>nano-satellites,</b> which is rather revolutionary, as no swarms of satellites have ever been flown, even for large satellites.

40|$|AbstractMicro and <b>Nano-satellites</b> {{with their}} low thermal {{capacitance}} {{are vulnerable to}} rapid temperature fluctuations. Therefore, thermal control becomes more important, but the limitations on mass and electrical power require new approaches.

The design and fabrication of a prototype of micro louvers are described. The actuation voltage of the micro louver's analytic model is also discussed.

40|$|Since December 2004 the International Maritime Organization's International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea {{requires}} that Automatic Identification System (AIS) {{has to be}} implemented on all international voyaging ships with gross tonnage of 300 or more tons, and on all passenger ships regardless of size. This stems from the need of collision avoidance, search-and-rescue operations and other maritime purposes. Ground-based AIS receiving station usually cannot cover ships over the horizon, but with space-based AIS signal receivers, the global ship monitoring became possible, providing data service for maritime administrations, cargo liners, and even navies. Since 2007, a number micro-satellites and <b>nano-satellites</b> have been launched for technical demonstration in this respect. However, at present the space-based global AIS data service is not fully operational and international cooperation is limited. In this paper, a constellation of 3 self-deorbiting <b>nano-satellites,</b> with a mass equivalent to 3 U cubesats, carrying AIS receivers is proposed to complement the existing systems. The feasible study presented here showed that this mission can be realized at very low cost, and quick-launched. Three other important features of the mission are: international cooperation, making a practical use of smaller <b>nano-satellites</b> and taking the responsibility for deorbiting the satellites {{at the end of}} mission. It is also the hope that this mission will become a milestone that marks the maturity of smaller nanosats, and give the "student satellite" projects around the world a new dimension for real application and sustainable business application...|$|R
