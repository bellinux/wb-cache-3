500|$|He {{was drawn}} in the event's first heat on 19 September, {{finishing}} first {{out of three}} entered swimmers, {{with a time of}} one minute and 52.72 seconds. The time established a new Equatoguinean swimming record in the discipline. Moussambani was the sole competing swimmer after the heat's two other competitors were disqualified for false starts. He used a large amount of energy in the first 50 metres, and as his legs stiffened, his pace reduced. Officials decided against retrieving him from the pool after he was observed to sink below the water shortly before finishing and he was cheered by the crowd throughout. Overall Moussambani finished 71st (and last) out of all athletes, and did not progress into the semi-finals after finishing one minute and 2.91 seconds slower than the slowest swimmer who made the later rounds. After completing the event, he said that it was [...] "a very special moment" [...] of which he would not forget and the crowd cheering motivated him to finish: [...] "Gold medal is not everything in the Olympics. I am really happy with what happened, it was all worth it. I want to come back <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the 2004 games in Athens." [...] Moussambani earned admiration from {{millions of people around the}} world, received a large amount of publicity for his effort, and was given the nickname [...] "Eric the Eel" [...] by the press.|$|E

We have had no news since, for even the wire to Colenso has been cut, and for {{anything}} we know the place may be in possession of the Boers. We have a little fort here, and have been throwing up entrenchments, but if they come in any force {{there is not much}} hope of our getting off. We have an armored train, which yesterday ran to within a mile or so of Colenso without being interfered with, though several parties of the enemy could be seen in the distance. I have great hopes that we shall get half a battalion up from Maritzburg to-morrow; if so, by loopholing the houses and throwing up some breastworks, {{we ought to be able}} to keep the Boers out of the place, unless they come in force. At any rate, I should advise you to scout next time beyond the Mooi River and to make Maritzburg your head-quarters. So far as we know the Boers have not yet gone beyond that river, and any news of their doing so would certainly be of value. You have done marvellously well in getting away from that party you met, but you might not be so lucky <b>next</b> <b>time,</b> <b>for</b> as they push on they are sure in a short time to be strong all over the country between the Tugela and the Mooi." ...|$|E

This work has shown that, for tempo-rally coherent inputs, a computed expectation of the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> step’s inputs pro-vides a basis upon which to focus attention. Expectations are useful in tasks which arise in visual and non-visual domains, ranging from scene analysis to anomaly detection. When temporally related inputs are available, an expectation of the next input’s contents can be computed based upon the current inputs. A saliency map, which is based upon the computed expectation and the actual inputs, indicates which inputs will be important for performing the task in the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> step. <b>For</b> exam-ple, in many visual object tracking problems, the relevant features are predictable...|$|R
