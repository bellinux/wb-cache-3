After a brief stint at a small college in Pennsylvania, she applied for the job at UConn, starting in 1975 and leading the team to a 38–66 record in five seasons. During her tenure, shooting guard Karen Mullins was the first UConn woman to receive a basketball scholarship; that <b>number</b> <b>had</b> increased to 12 by 1980.|$|E

Attendances began to fall {{towards the end of}} the 1960s; this trend continued through the 1970s, though the decade did give Tranmere its largest-ever crowd: 24,424 on 5 February 1972, for a fourth-round FA Cup match against Stoke City. With today's capacity of under 17,000, it is unlikely that this record attendance will ever be broken.|$|E

5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} on fish, {{pelicans}} are highly susceptible to oil spills, both directly by being oiled {{and by the}} impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that <b>number</b> <b>had</b> been harmed {{as a result of the}} spill.|$|E

This success led to $290,000 in financial {{assistance from the}} RNC, mainly to implement Jack Abramoff's field representative program. Abramoff's fund-raising efforts brought in an additional $1,160,000 {{during the next two}} years. By 1983, only 10% of the CRNC's budget came from the RNC.|$|E

Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints. WMATA claimed that a number of factors contributed to the ridership crunch: the system was experiencing record ridership; two-year-old ridership projections were used; the five stations were opened two months ahead of schedule; the five new stations were opened two months before new rail cars were ready for service; and WMATA offered free parking at the Green Line stations, which drew 12,000 rather than 4,000 riders to the line.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} few months, the wing was not {{assigned}} any aircraft, and thus worked with other units who were in possession of the B-36 Peacemaker. In March and April, the base began preparing for operations of the B-36, which arrived later in April. This gave the newly activated 69th Bombardment Squadron {{a full complement of}} aircraft. By the end of August, the <b>number</b> <b>had</b> increased to 27 bombers, 322 officers, 313 airmen, and 350 civilians. Additionally, more buildings were constructed on base, making it more of a home for airmen and their families.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Beth Israel {{purchased}} {{the home of}} New Orleans' former mayor Joseph A. Shakspeare at 1610 Carondelet Street. Funds for the new acquisition came from both the Orthodox and Reform communities of New Orleans. After remodeling the building, the congregation began holding services there, {{in time for the}} 1906 High Holy Days. Membership grew quickly; by 1910 Beth Israel was the second-largest Jewish congregation in the city, with 180 member families, and by 1914 that <b>number</b> <b>had</b> grown to 250 families. By 1918, however, membership had fallen to 175 families. That year the synagogue's income was $6,000 (today $).|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{the storm}} brought {{considerable}} {{damage to the}} nation; {{it was also the}} first storm to affect the nation since Tropical Storm Domoina in 1984. Damage totaled to $10million (1988USD). Property damage alone totaled to $1.5million, just under $1million of which came from buildings. Moreover, insured losses from the storm totaled $1 million. Even though the death toll was initially believed to be 57; by March 14, this <b>number</b> <b>had</b> increased to the final death toll of 100 after additional information was received from remote areas of the country.

5|$|Since gaining {{air superiority}} over U.S. forces {{was out of}} the question, the {{northern}} leadership decided to implement a policy of air deniability. At the beginning of the campaign, North Vietnam possessed approximately 1,500 anti-aircraft weapons, most of which were of the light 37 and 57mm variety. Within one year, however, the U.S. estimated that the <b>number</b> <b>had</b> grown to over 5,000 guns, including 85 and 100mm radar-directed weapons. That estimate was later revised downward from a high of 7,000 in early 1967 to less than a thousand by 1972.
