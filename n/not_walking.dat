5|$|Prior to the game, First Lady Michelle Obama and Second Lady Jill Biden escorted former Yankees catcher and World War II veteran Yogi Berra to the mound, {{where the}} {{ceremonial}} first pitch was thrown by {{a veteran of}} the Iraq War. The Phillies' Ryan Howard got the first hit of the 2009 World Series by doubling in the first inning. Howard was stranded in the first and the game was scoreless after two innings. The Phillies scored first with a two-out solo home run by Chase Utley {{in the top of the}} third inning. Through the first five innings, Philadelphia starting pitcher Cliff Lee allowed no runs and three hits, striking out seven Yankees batters. In the top of the sixth, Utley hit another solo home run to give the Phillies a 2–0 lead. The starting pitchers Lee and CC Sabathia continued to pitch until the top of the eighth when Sabathia was replaced by Phil Hughes. Hughes walked the first two batters and was replaced by Dámaso Marte. Marte got two quick outs and was relieved by David Robertson, who walked Jayson Werth and gave up a two-run single to Raúl Ibañez. The Phillies added two more runs in the ninth with an RBI single by Shane Victorino and an RBI double by Howard. Lee finished with a complete game allowing one unearned run on six hits and striking out ten batters, <b>not</b> <b>walking</b> any of the hitters he faced.|$|E
5|$|As {{parliament}} {{is usually}} in recess {{during the summer}} months, Fingleton's political journalism did not often interfere with his cricket radio commentary for the ABC or his cricket writing, except during tours of England in the Australian winter. Fingleton mainly freelanced for overseas newspapers as he regarded Australian editors as being difficult to work with, and because the pay was lower. In 1946–47, England toured Australia for the first full Test series since the war. Fingleton criticised Bradman for <b>not</b> <b>walking</b> after hitting a disputed catch to Jack Ikin. Fingleton and most in the press box thought that the catch was clean but the umpire ruled in favour of Bradman. At the time Bradman had been making a comeback from ill health and had been struggling, and {{it was thought that}} he would retire if he could not discover his old form. After the dispute catch however, Bradman began timing the ball and went on to score 187. Fingleton openly criticised the decision to give Bradman not out in his writing. Later in the series, he decried Bradman's tactics of having his pacemen bowl frequent bouncers at the English batsmen, pointing out that it was hypocritical for the Australian captain to vociferously condemn Jardine's tactics years earlier. As Fingleton {{was one of the few}} who were forthright enough to question the actions of national hero Bradman, many sources within the Australian cricket community chose to confide in him, most notably all-rounder Keith Miller, whose cavalier attitude brought him into conflict with Bradman's ruthless approach to victory. The following season, during the Indian team's tour of Australia, Fingleton began his association with The Hindu.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{traveled}} to Wrigley Field {{and started the}} month of August with a 6-4 victory over the Chicago Cubs, extending the road winning streak to 11. The following day they won again 6-2, tying the all-time franchise record of 12 set by the 1924 Brooklyn Robins. Hyun-jin Ryu became the first Dodger rookie to win 10 games in a season since Kazuhisa Ishii in 2002. A two-run single by Carl Crawford keyed the Dodgers' 3-0 win over the Cubs on August 3 to extend the streak to 13, a new franchise record and the longest in the National League since the 1976 Phillies also won 13. The team finished off a sweep of the Cubs with a 1-0 victory. Stephen Fife came off the DL to pitch 5 1/3 scoreless innings and Kenley Jansen pitched a scoreless ninth for his 17th save, and 25th consecutive batter he had retired in a row. This was the Dodgers' first four-game sweep at Wrigley Field since 1954. Zack Greinke picked up his 100th career win in the Dodgers' 3-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium. He pitched 6 1/3 innings and drove in the eventual winning run with a single in the seventh. A lack of clutch hitting led to the Dodgers first road loss in a month, a 5-1 loss to the Cardinals on August 7. The streak ended at 15, just two behind the all-time record set by the 1984 Tigers and 1916 Giants. Cardinals starter Shelby Miller {{had to leave the}} next game after only two pitches due to injury and the Dodgers erupted for 6 runs in the second inning {{on their way to a}} 13-4 win. Crawford had 4 hits from the leadoff spot and both Andre Ethier and Skip Schumaker had 3 hits and 4 RBI in the win. Ryu struck out seven in seven innings while <b>not</b> <b>walking</b> a batter and allowing only one unearned run as the Dodgers completed a 7-1 road trip with a 5-1 win. A. J. Ellis delivered the big blow with a 3 run homer.|$|E

2500|$|Between flops, it is true, I {{have come}} up with an {{occasional}} hit, but compared to a good boxer's record, for instance, my percentage has been lamentable. I fought a draw in my first fight, stupified everyone by winning the championship in my second, got a couple of wins with picture rights, then was knocked out three times in a row. Dragging my weary carcass to Hollywood, I was immediately knocked out again, won a big fight some six months later, then marked time for six years as an ordinary ham-and-beaner, picking up what I could. Suddenly I saw a chance and offered to fight for the world championship for a dollar. To everyone's astonishment, I won that championship and defended it successfully for a number of years, winning nine times by knockout, fighting three draws, losing twice and getting one no-decision in Europe. I have just come over to America for a fight, but it was called off at the last moment, one of the promoters having gone nuts and having to have been locked up.

2500|$|Jason Matthews of Legacy Effects, {{successor}} to Stan Winston Studios, {{was hired to}} turn production designer Tom Meyer's robot designs into practical animatronic props. He said, [...] "We have 26-and-a-half total live-action robots that were made for this film. They all have hydraulic neck controls. Atom has RC [...] hands as well." [...] According to Jackman, executive producer Spielberg [...] "actually said to Shawn, 'You should really have real elements where you can.' ... Basically if they're <b>not</b> <b>walking</b> or fighting, that's a real robot." [...] Levy added that Spielberg gave the example of Jurassic Park, where Winston's animatronic dinosaurs [...] "got a better performance from the actors, as they were seeing something real, and gave the visual effects team {{an idea of what}} it would look like." [...] As Real Steel was not based on a toy, Meyer said that [...] "there was no guideline" [...] for the robots, and each was designed from scratch, with an attempt to put [...] "different personality and aesthetics," [...] according to Levy. In Atom's case, it tried to have a more humanizing design to be an [...] "everyman" [...] who could attract the audience's sympathy and serve as a proxy to the viewer, with a fencing mask that Meyer explained served to show [...] "his identity was a bit hidden, so you have to work harder to get to see him." [...] Executive producer Robert Zemeckis added that the mask [...] "became a screen so we can project what we want on Atom's face." [...] Damage was added to the robots' decoration to show how they were machines worn out by intense battles.|$|E
