40|$|Neutrophils {{are rapidly}} {{released}} into the circulation upon acute stress such as trauma or acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We hypothesized that <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> might provide incremental value in the early diagnosis and risk stratification of AMI.; We conducted a prospective observational multicenter study to examine the diagnostic accuracy of the combination of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> and cardiac troponin T from 1125 consecutive patients who presented to the Emergency Department with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. The final diagnosis was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists.; <b>Neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> was higher in patients with acute myocardial infarction compared with other diagnoses (median 6. 7 vs. 5. 0 × 10 (9) /L, respectively, P >. 001). The accuracy of the <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction, quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0. 69, which was significantly {{lower than that of}} cardiac troponin T (AUC 0. 89, P >. 001). The combination of the <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> and cardiac troponin T did not improve the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction versus cardiac troponin T alone (P=. 79).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bone marrow {{suppression}} is a well-recognized {{toxicity of}} the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Reduction of the peginterferon dose because of neutropenia is common in clinical practice. However, reduction of peginterferon dose during the first weeks of HCV treatment is associated with failure to achieve sustained virological response. AIMS: The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate whether the fall of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> during hepatitis C treatment is associated with achieving sustained virological response. METHODS: We performed an observational study of patients who completed peginterferon and ribavirin treatment in an Infectious Diseases Department in Manchester, UK. RESULTS: Of the 74 patients included in the analysis, 78 % had genotype 2 or 3 hepatitis C and 15 % had liver cirrhosis. Sustained virological response was achieved in 78 % of patients. On univariate analysis, factors related to achieving sustained virological response were younger age, genotype 2 or 3, baseline <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count,</b> and fall of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> during treatment. Multivariate analysis showed baseline <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> > 3. 5 x 10 (3) cells/mm(3) [odds ratio (OR) 5. 7; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 24 - 26. 3] and a reduction of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> > 60 % (OR 4. 5; 95 % CI 1. 03 - 19. 9) to be independently associated with achieving sustained virological response. Neutropenia was not associated with an increased risk of infections. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study, higher baseline <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> and fall of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> during the treatment of hepatitis C was associated with achieving sustained virological response. These findings could have important implications for the monitoring and management of HCV treatment with peginterferon if they are confirmed in other studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: to {{evaluate}} whether total and differential WBC counts are altered in young obese patients (aged 6 - 12 years) and if a relationship exists between WBC counts and the severity of obesity {{as well as with}} CRP level. Materials and Methods: a group of 77 obese patients [32 males and 45 females] and 19 controls [7 males and 12 females] were studied. Total WBC count was performed by using an automatic blood cell counter. Blood cell morphology and WBC differential count were evaluated in Wright stained blood films. The plasma levels of CRP were evaluated by immunoturbidimetry. Results: obese participants presented with a statistically significant higher neutrophil percentage and CRP levels when compared to controls; the median CRP value was about 5 times higher than that observed in controls. Absolute <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were also higher in patients, though without statistical significance. The parameters that were statistically significant related with adiposity markers were <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> and CRP levels. The <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> was positively and statistically correlated with body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score, waist circumference and waist/height ratio, and also with CRP levels. In multiple regression analysis, the only variable that remained statistically associated with <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> was CRP (<b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> = 2. 612 + 0. 439 lnCRP; standardised coefficient/beta: 0. 384, P= 0. 001).

40|$|In acute {{myocardial}} infarction (AMI), elevated <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> {{has been associated with}} more severe coronary artery disease and larger infarct size. Elevated mean platelet volume (MPV) is also associated with poor clinical outcome and impaired angiographic reperfusion in patients with AMI. But, the associations of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> and MPV with the indices of tissue level reperfusion were not fully elucidated.

40|$|We {{examined}} the relationship of leukocyte colony-stimulating activity (CSA) in vitro to <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> in vivo.

The total leukocyte CSA per ml (TLCSA) of blood varied directly with the blood <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> in a group of patients with a wide range in blood <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count,</b> and in two patients recovering from neutropenia in whom serial observations were made. In the latter two patients the rise in TLCSA did not antedate the rise in blood <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count,</b> suggesting that blood leukocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF) per se probably has little biologic significance. However, release into the circulation of cells which generate CSF could be an important way of controlling the amount of CSF acting within the marrow.

Bevacizumab use increased median overall survival (OS) 18. 7 vs 11. 3 months, p = 0. 0014). In multivariate analysis, age, initial surgery, <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count,</b> Karnofsky status > 70 % and bevacizumab administration were independent prognostic factors of survival. We found an interaction between bevacizumab use and baseline <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count.</b> The cut-off value for the <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> was set at 6000 /mm(3).

The effects of pretreatment peripheral blood neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio on survival were examined using the proportional hazards regression model to estimate hazard ratios after adjustment for covariates. The optimal cut-off value was determined by proportional hazards regression analysis with the minimum P-value approach and shrinkage procedure. After adjustment for prognostic factors, the pretreatment elevated <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> was statistically significantly associated with short overall (P = 0. 0008) and progression-free survival (P = 0. 024), whereas no association was found between prognosis and lymphocyte or monocyte count. The cut-off value selected for <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> was 4500 mm- 3 (corrected hazard ratio, 1. 67; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 09 - 2. 54).

Other catechins extracted from SSD could increase Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) and Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6).
