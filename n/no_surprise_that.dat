5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Model {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} as a capable officer with great potential. Early on in his military career, Model had written a book on the Prussian general August Neidhardt von Gneisenau. In addition, he was already known to Hans von Seeckt, head of the slimmed-down Reichswehr, from his staff postings during the war, and he was equipped with an excellent reference from Major-General Franz von Rantau, commander of the 36th Reserve Division. It was thus <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> {{he was one of the}} 4,000 officers retained in the Reichswehr. Model generally kept away from politics in the chaotic period that marked the birth of the Weimar Republic, although as an army officer he was involved in the bloody suppression of the 1920 communist uprising in the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the successes}} under Basil, {{during the reign}} of his {{successor}} Leo VI the Wise (886–912), the Empire again faced serious threats. In the north, a war broke out against the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon, and a part of the Imperial Fleet was used in 895 to ferry an army of Magyars across the Danube to raid Bulgaria. The Bulgarian war produced several costly defeats, {{while at the same time}} the Arab naval threat reached new heights, with successive raids devastating the shores of Byzantium's naval heartland, the Aegean Sea. In 891 or 893, the Arab fleet sacked the island of Samos and took its stratēgos prisoner, and in 898, the eunuch admiral Raghib carried off 3,000 Byzantine sailors of the Kibyrrhaiotai as prisoners. These losses denuded Byzantine defences, opening the Aegean up to raids by the Syrian fleets. The first heavy blow came in 901, when the renegade Damian of Tarsus plundered Demetrias, while in the next year, Taormina, the Empire's last outpost in Sicily, fell to the Muslims. The greatest disaster, however, came in 904, when another renegade, Leo of Tripoli, raided the Aegean. His fleet penetrated even into the Dardanelles, before proceeding to sack the Empire's second city, Thessalonica, all while the Empire's fleet remained passive in the face of the Arabs' superior numbers. Furthermore, the Cretan corsairs' raids reached such intensity, that by the end of Leo's reign, most of the southern Aegean islands were either abandoned or forced to accept Muslim control and pay tribute to the pirates. It is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> a defensive and cautious mindset is prevalent in the Leo's contemporary instructions on naval warfare (Naumachica).|$|E
25|$|Bearing this in mind, {{it should}} come as <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> many subantarctic glaciers are also in retreat. Mass balance is {{significantly}} negative on many glaciers on Kergeulen Island, Heard Island, South Georgia and Bouvet Island.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{movie is}} simply a failure of imagination. Nobody looked at the {{screenplay}} and observed that it didn't try hard enough, <b>that</b> it had <b>no</b> <b>surprises,</b> <b>that</b> it didn't attempt to delight its audiences with twists and turns on the phoned-in plotline." [...] —Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times ...|$|R
5000|$|.....a stone {{monument}} is {{an expression}} of permanence. It is <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> the Roman obsession with personal immortality acquired its physical form in stone." ...|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{despite the}} other successes, it was <b>no</b> real <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> the League Challenge Cup saw yet another first round exit, {{this time to}} Stranraer.|$|R
25|$|He showed early {{promise as}} an all-round sportsman, excelling in both cricket and football, and {{achieving}} good standards in golf and basketball. He demonstrated that good hand, ball and eye co-ordination {{can be applied}} to many sports, and thus it is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> he was able to make his living through sport.|$|E
25|$|While it was <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> the ABC did {{not make}} an {{immediate}} announcement about the show's fate - many Australian television series will often miss a year due to actor's schedules and production demands - it was eight months before an announcement was made. During this time, Jason Donovan and Felix Nobis both {{moved on to other}} projects.|$|E
25|$|In the 1985/86 season, {{his first}} playing for Auckland, he scored 174 on debut, the highest ever debut {{score for the}} province. In his first two seasons in New Zealand, he scored 1234 runs at 38.56 and took 42 wickets at 26.69, so it was <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> he was called up to the Test team.|$|E
3000|$|It {{comes as}} <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> then, <b>that</b> Friedrich von Zahn gratefully {{took up his}} brother’s suggestion. A mere two weeks later, on 24 October 1955, he wrote back to ‘dear Peter’: [...]...|$|R
50|$|It came as <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> {{the home}} ground of Atlético Paranaense, which was {{originally}} constructed back in 1914, {{was among those}} venues chosen to host games at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.|$|R
5000|$|Joel Tobeck as Richard Foster, He {{runs the}} Waimoana {{surveillance}} team {{and it is}} his job to make sure nothing is out of place. It is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> then <b>that</b> Alec Ross very quickly catches his attention.|$|R
25|$|Chorea {{is another}} {{condition}} which results from {{damage to the}} basal ganglia. Similar to athetosis, it results from mutations affecting the pallidum inhibition of the thalamus as well as increased dopaminergic activity {{at the level of}} the striatum. Considering the etiology of both disorders are fairly similar, it comes as <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> chorea and athetosis can and usually do occur together in a condition called choreoathetosis.|$|E
25|$|From {{the point}} of view of Albert Einstein's theory, it comes as <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> all {{attempts}} to treat gravity simply like one more quantum force (on par with electromagnetism and the nuclear forces) have failed. According to Einstein, gravity is not a force – it is a property of space-time itself. Loop quantum gravity is an attempt to develop a quantum theory of gravity based directly on Einstein's geometrical formulation.|$|E
25|$|Much {{the same}} way that the {{influential}} Duke Ellington matched his scores to the unique abilities of his performers, Hefti was able to take advantage of the same kind of 'fine-tuning' to bring out the best of the talents of the Basie band. Therefore, it should come as <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> when the same charts are played by a different band, even the composer's own, that the result is not as strong.|$|E
25|$|Upper Canadians saw {{themselves}} as citizens of Great Britain with all the rights granted by the British Constitution. It is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> then, <b>that</b> the Upper Canadian Reform Movement should adopt the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement.|$|R
40|$|Making a {{prediction}} is essentially expressing a belief about the future. It is therefore natural to interpret later predictions as revisions of earlier ones and {{to investigate the}} notion of belief revision in this context. We study, both semantically and syntactically, the following principle of minimum revision of prediction: “as {{long as there are}} <b>no</b> <b>surprises,</b> <b>that</b> is, as long as what actually occurs had been predicted to occur, then everything which was predicted in the past, if still possible, should continue to be predicted, and no new predictions should be added. ”...|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{statistical}} techniques, electoral data have become increasingly easy to handle. It is <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> then, <b>that</b> election forecasting has become a big business, for polling firms, news organizations, and betting markets as well as academic students of politics.|$|R
25|$|To {{gain the}} passage of the Connecticut Plan its proponents needed support of three {{southern}} states, Georgia and the two Carolinas, complementing the small state coalition of the North. It came as <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> Ellsworth favored the Three-Fifths Compromise on the enumeration of slaves and opposed the abolition of the foreign slave trade. Stressing that he had no slaves, Ellsworth spoke twice before the Convention, on August 21 and 22, in favor of slavery being abolished.|$|E
25|$|In this sense, it is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> Bach's {{music is}} easily and often {{performed}} on instruments {{it was not}} necessarily written for, that it is transcribed so often, and that his melodies turn up in unexpected places such as jazz music. Apart from that, Bach left a number of compositions without specified instrumentation: the Canons BWV 1072–1078 fall in that category, {{as well as the}} bulk of The Musical Offering and The Art of Fugue.|$|E
25|$|The season {{started off}} in Brazil {{and all the}} native fans were {{supporting}} Senna. It was <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> Senna took pole ahead of Schumacher, Alesi, Hill, Frentzen and Gianni Morbidelli. At the start, Alesi took second from Schumacher while Wendlinger and Verstappen, who was driving in place of Lehto who had suffered a neck injury in testing, got ahead of Frentzen and Morbidelli. At the end of lap 1 Senna was leading Alesi, Schumacher, Hill, Wendlinger and Verstappen.|$|E

5000|$|E-mail is such seductive, {{powerful}} evidence. It's personal, {{plentiful and}} candid. For most adults, e-mail is their {{primary means of}} written communication. When lawyers think [...] "e-discovery," [...] it's the e-mail they crave. <b>No</b> <b>surprise,</b> then, <b>that</b> e-mail traffic is the most sought-after and fought-over ESI.|$|R
25|$|Kinetics is {{the science}} of motion. Joule was a pupil of Dalton and it is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> he had learned a firm belief in the atomic theory, {{even though there were}} many {{scientists}} of his time who were still skeptical. He had also been {{one of the few people}} receptive to the neglected work of John Herapath on the kinetic theory of gases. He was further profoundly influenced by Peter Ewart's 1813 paper On the measure of moving force.|$|E
25|$|President Toda's linking of Makiguchi's {{progressive}} {{ideals and}} Nichiren Shōshū institutions created an immensely effective, if inherently unstable alliance, {{which resulted in}} periodic outbreaks of tension between the priesthood and the laity. Other scholars have observed that it is <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> a culturally conservative Japanese priesthood built on ideas of hierarchy, ritual, and traditional custom should conflict with a global lay movement built on ideas of egalitarianism, active faith, and rational adaption to the modern world would be unsustainable.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of Irish immigrants in America {{has not always}} been harmonious. The US did not have a good relationship with most of the incoming Irish because of their Roman Catholic faith, as {{the majority of the population}} was Protestant and had been originally formed by offshoots of the Protestant faith, many of whom were from Northern Ireland (Ulster). So it came as <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> the federal government issued new immigration acts, adding to previous ones which limited Eastern European immigration, ones which limited the immigration of the Irish.|$|E
5000|$|Matt Devlin (Jamie Bamber, series 1-5), is a Detective Sergeant and the Junior Partner to Ronnie's senior role. Flirtatious, tech-savvy and people-smart, Matt formed strong {{bonds with}} both Alesha and Natalie. It was <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> then, <b>that</b> {{when he was}} gunned down outside a court-house, the team were inconsolable.|$|R
50|$|In the League Cup, Dumbarton {{were handed}} the toughest of {{qualifying}} groups, being up against 3 {{of the top}} Premier League sides, and it was <b>no</b> real <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> {{there would be no}} further interest in this competition although a home win over Hearts was well received.|$|R
50|$|Resultantly, when British Steel {{announced}} its 10-year integrated production plan for South Wales, {{it came as}} <b>no</b> real <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> it proposed the cessation of {{iron and steel making}} operations at the Ebbw Vale works, with the proposal to redeveloped the site as a specialist tinplate manufacturer.|$|R
25|$|His {{popularity}} {{peaked in}} the 1980s. Magnetic Band constantly toured the Soviet Union. In 1982, Washington Post dedicated a whole page to Gunnar Graps and the Magnetic Band. It was <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> in 1983 Magnetic Band got {{banned by the}} Soviet authorities, which led to creation of GGG (Gunnar Graps Group). The change also marked a shift towards straightforward hard rock and heavy metal, genres which Magnetic Band were already flirting with (Note: all the musical groups in Soviet Union had to be evaluated before {{they were allowed to}} perform or exist at all).|$|E
25|$|It {{might have}} been well if Nubar had {{confined}} himself to this modest programme, but it was perhaps hardly to be expected of {{a man of his}} ability and restless energy. It must be admitted, however, that the characters of Nubar and Lord Cromer were not formed to run in harness, and it was with <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> the public learnt in June 1888 that he had been relieved of office, though his dismissal was the direct act of the khedive Tawfiq, who did not on this occasion seek the advice of the British agent.|$|E
25|$|With the disappointing {{second half}} of the season, it was <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> DC United didn't take home any pos-season awards, in {{contrast}} to the 2014 season. Bill Hamid finished 3rd in voting for Goalkeeper of the Year, despite finishing first in voting among MLS club management. Although his save percentage made him the league leader, presumably the amount of time he missed for injuries played a factor in the voting, The team went into the offseason with a plan to keep the core together, announcing new deals for Saborio, Rolfe, Boswell and DeLeon, while discussions continued with Kitchen.|$|E

3000|$|Under {{the light}} of these considerations, it is of <b>no</b> big <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> during that period, the {{aforementioned}} notions and connotations marking the organizational pattern of family firms were fed up into and reflected by institutional actors of the caliber of the ‘United Nations’ declaring as follows: [...]...|$|R
5000|$|For the Party, {{performing}} critical texts at {{a public}} concert with symphonic backing had a potentially much greater impact than simply reading the same texts at home privately.
