5|$|The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment {{consisted}} of nine companies—four from Maryland and five from Virginia. The two-state {{composition of the}} <b>new</b> <b>unit</b> precluded it from being managed through a single state government, and it was therefore directly responsible to national authority as an Extra Continental regiment.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes to}} unit {{structure}} in the 4th century were reduction of unit sizes and increase in unit numbers, establishment of <b>new</b> <b>unit</b> types and establishment of a hierarchy of units {{more complex than the}} old one of legions and auxilia.|$|E
5|$|In 1931 Harry Cohn {{became the}} first studio head to {{implement}} the <b>new</b> <b>unit</b> production system, wherein producers were given specific responsibility over individual films, rather than supervising dozens of pictures in a given year. Briskin {{was one of the}} first four of this new class of producer selected by Cohn, while still maintaining his assistant general manager status. In 1932 Briskin went from assistant general manager, to general manager at Columbia, the announcement being made by in early June by Sam Cohn.|$|E

5|$|In the interrogation, McGarrett informs Sang Min {{that if he}} goes to prison, his Rwandan {{wife and}} son will be deported, leaving his son {{at the mercy of}} the Hutu militias. If he cooperates, McGarrett will ensure they stay in America. Sang Min reveals that Hesse is going to leave the island on a Chinese freighter. Danny and McGarrett hastily drive to the docks. They then proceed to assault the freighter, where they {{dispatch}} several of Hesse's guards. McGarrett confronts Hesse, and shoots him off the boat. At the end of the episode, the new team settle into their new office space, and cannot settle on a name for their <b>new</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1940, the 7th Infantry Division was {{reactivated}} at Camp Ord, California Under {{the command}} of Major General Joseph W. Stilwell. The Headquarters element, 13th and 14th Brigades did not reactivate, however, and the division was instead centered around three infantry regiments; the 17th Infantry Regiment, the 32nd Infantry Regiment, and the 53rd Infantry Regiment. The 13th Brigade was not activated {{for the duration of}} the war and its headquarters formation was not used to form a <b>new</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scandal erupted when Teller (and his {{associate}} Lowell Wood) {{were accused}} of deliberately overselling the program and perhaps had encouraged the dismissal of a laboratory director (Roy Woodruff) who had attempted to correct the error. His claims led to a joke which circulated in the scientific community, that a <b>new</b> <b>unit</b> of unfounded optimism was designated as the teller; one teller was so large that most events had to be measured in nanotellers or picotellers.|$|E

5|$|The two commanders {{believed}} that training by both airborne troops and aircrews could {{be completed by}} the end of February, when there would be suitable meteorological conditions for such an operation to take place. Training for the raid was begun immediately, but encountered several problems. 38 Wing was a <b>new</b> <b>unit</b> {{still in the process of}} formation, so No. 51 Squadron RAF under Wing Commander Percy Charles Pickard was selected to provide the aircraft and aircrew needed for the operation, although Group Captain Nigel Norman of 38 Wing would remain in overall command. Another problem encountered was the state of training of the unit of airborne troops chosen to raid the installation.|$|E
5|$|The works {{was shut}} down on 25 June 2007, after the Don burst its banks, and the entire site was engulfed by several feet of water. It {{remained}} submerged for over a week, {{with much of the}} equipment suffering catastrophic damage. Once the water subsided, imaginative ways had to be found to return it to operation within a reasonable time. The analyser which measures emissions from the incinerator plant had been completely destroyed, and in order to mitigate a 16-week delivery time, the manufacturers removed one from a training centre at Telford, and it was hired by Yorkshire Water until a <b>new</b> <b>unit</b> could be supplied. The plant was recommissioned and operational just 18 days after its inundation.|$|E
5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The <b>new</b> <b>unit</b> could be fitted with five or six gears and was tall and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E

5|$|After {{her return}} to Japan, Hōshō was {{transferred}} to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the training fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in the Inland Sea for aircraft that flew in from shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board Hōshō. On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both Hōshō and Ryūhō were assigned to the <b>new</b> <b>unit.</b> The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, Hōshō was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in the Inland Sea. In this role, Hōshō shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending equal amounts of time at each location.|$|E
5|$|As the SS grew in {{size and}} importance, so too did Hitler's {{personal}} protection units. Three main SS groups were assigned to protect Hitler. In 1933, his larger personal bodyguard unit (previously the 1st SS-Standarte) was called to Berlin to replace the Army Chancellery Guard, assigned to protect the Chancellor of Germany. Sepp Dietrich commanded the <b>new</b> <b>unit,</b> previously known as SS-Stabswache Berlin; the name was changed to SS-Sonderkommando Berlin. In November 1933, the name was changed to Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. In April 1934, Himmler modified the name to Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). The LSSAH guarded Hitler's private residences and offices, providing an outer ring of protection for the Führer and his visitors. LSSAH men manned sentry posts at the entrances to the old Reich Chancellery and the new Reich Chancellery. The number of LSSAH guards was increased during special events. At the Berghof, Hitler's residence in the Obersalzberg, a large contingent of the LSSAH patrolled an extensive cordoned security zone.|$|E
5|$|Based {{around the}} {{overflow}} of volunteers for the 1st Rhodesia Regiment, {{a core of}} personnel for a second Southern Rhodesian expeditionary unit was in place by November 1914. This was made into the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment (2RR) during December 1914 and January 1915. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment's lack of combat experience thus far influenced those men in Southern Rhodesia who were yet to enlist; many Rhodesian colonials were keen to fight on the front lines, and some resolved {{that they might have}} to travel to Europe to be sure of doing so. Aware of this competition with the Western Front for the colony's manpower, recruiters for the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment took great care to assure potential inductees that they would definitely see combat, in Africa, if they signed up for the <b>new</b> <b>unit.</b> The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment ultimately had a paper strength of 500 men, the same as the 1st. Thirty black scouts, recruited in Southern Rhodesia, were also attached to the regiment.|$|E

5|$|Between 1947 and September 22, 1949, Peng's forces {{occupied}} Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. His forces repeatedly defeated, {{but were}} not able to destroy, the forces of Hu Zongnan and Ma Bufang, which retreated into Sichuan and were airlifted to Taiwan when the Kuomintang lost the Civil War in December 1949. In October Peng's forces, led directly by Wang Zhen, invaded Xinjiang. Most of Xinjiang's defenders surrendered peacefully, and were incorporated as a <b>new</b> <b>unit</b> in Peng's army, but some ethnic guerrilla bands resisted Chinese control for several years. After the People's Republic of China was declared on October 1, 1949, Peng was appointed Chairman of the Northwest China Military and Administrative Commission and Commander-in-Chief and Political Commissar of Xinjiang, with Wang Zhen as his deputy. This appointment gave Peng responsibility over Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, an area of over five millionsquare kilometres (1.9million square miles) but under thirty million people. Peng's forces continued their gradual occupation of Xinjiang, which they completed in September 1951.|$|E
5|$|Following the British request, the Australian Government {{decided on}} 15 February 1917 to {{establish}} a 6th Division in the United Kingdom. The first element of this division, the 16th Brigade, was formed soon afterwards, with most of its personnel being soldiers recovering in the UK from illness or wounds. As the AIF units in France were at or above their authorised strength at this time, officers and non-commissioned officers were also transferred from the five existing divisions to the <b>new</b> <b>unit.</b> A 17th Brigade and several machine gun, mortar, engineer, signal and sanitary units were subsequently established within the 6th Division. While no officer was appointed to command the division, Brigadier General Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan and Brigadier General John Gellibrand were designated for this role at different times.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to demands for more aircrew to meet Australia's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, flying {{training in the}} RAAF was again expanded in 1951–52, resulting in the functions of No.1 FTS being split among three separately located units. No.1 FTS itself was renamed No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS) in March 1952, and assumed responsibility for advanced weapons and combat training on CAC Wirraways. Meanwhile, in November 1951, No.1 Initial Flying Training School (No.1 IFTS) was raised at RAAF Station Archerfield, Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on de Havilland Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No.1 IFTS went on to another <b>new</b> <b>unit,</b> No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) at RAAF Base Uranquinty, New South Wales, where they underwent further aerial instruction that included instrument, formation and night flying, as well as aerobatics and navigation. The first part of their training at No.1 BFTS included 40 hours on Tiger Moths, after which they would fly 50 hours on Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No.1 AFTS, before graduating as sergeant pilots.|$|E
