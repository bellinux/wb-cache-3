40|$|Abstract: A {{proposed}} {{satellite system}} (named "GeoBeacons") can detect and locate small transmitters on the Earth's surface. Transmitted code-modulated signals will be relayed {{to a central}} processing site by a constellation of repeater satellites. This system could provide an inexpensive way to monitor geodetic networks with more sites than can be monitored with <b>NAVSTAR</b> GPS (<b>Global</b> <b>Positioning</b> <b>System)</b> receivers. GeoBeacons will use doubly differenced observations, as are used in current geodetic GPS research. Two particularly simple constellations of GeoBeacon satellites are considered: (i) a coplanar pair of polar orbiting satellites, with differing mean motions such that one overtakes the other fortnightly, and (ii) 16 satellites in the same sun-synchronous orbit. Observations from consecutive passes are used to obtain three-dimensional position estimates. In both cases, the satellites could be small and lightweight, similar to th...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the accuracy of}} the two U. S. national hybrid geoid models (GEOID 09 and GEOID 03) in Connecticut. I compared National Geodetic Survey (NGS) North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) orthometric heights with orthometric heights determined by subtracting modeled (GEOID 09 and GEOID 03) geoid heights from <b>NAVSTAR</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Position</b> <b>System</b> (GPS) -derived ellipsoid heights. The GPS observation campaign (2007 – 2008) followed NGS guidelines for ellipsoid heights, and resulted in 60 days of GPS observations on 50 First-Order bench marks and 22 temporary bench marks with transferred elevations. I determined ellipsoid heights with least-squares adjustments of baseline vector networks using TOPCON Pinnacle GNSS observation processing software package, holding 12 Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) as control. I used On-line Positioning User Service (OPUS) -ellipsoid heights as a check, and found no statistically significant differences (2 - σ) between adjusted ellipsoid heights and OPUS ellipsoid heights. I examined the effects of phase center variation (PCV) by computing ellipsoid-height differences between the network with PCV corrections and the same network without PCV corrections. The differences were statistically significant (2 - σ) and the uncorrected PCV network produces biased-solutions. I investigated the effect on ellipsoid heights resulting from allowing vectors not meeting NGS quality standards into the network. There were no statistically-significant differences (2 - σ) in a network of a single-day 2 ̆ 7 s data nor in a network of all data. Adjusted GPS-derived orthometric heights were subtracted from NGS published heights, and I performed residual analyses and two residuals at bench marks {{on the edge of the}} study area appeared as outliers. Analysis of residuals at bench marks belonging to NGS specified stability classes A, B and C revealed statistically significant differences between each class. The maximum residual value increases with decreasing stability class. I also analyzed the residuals by fitting a planar regression model, computing a datum transformation model, and by using kriging estimation. The results suggest that the residuals are random with no significant underlying spatial structure, which indicates that GEOID 09 and GEOID 03 perform within NGS-published specifications (Roman et al., 2009 and 2004) with no evidence of bias. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{incident}} {{has previously}} been reported where the signal from the <b>Navstar</b> 43 <b>Global</b> <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> (GPS) satellite contained phase anomalies {{in such a way}} as to mimic ionospheric scintillation. We have observed another 25 events from the same satellite, plus events from three more satellites. Our data includes simultaneous observations from widely spaced receivers (up to 6, 590 km apart), from different manufacturers, further ruling out the possibility of local effects. Two of the events involved a satellite (GPS IIF SV- 2) broadcasting the L 2 C signal. This signal contained phase deviations matching those of the L 1 signal, but with a 120 / 154 multiplicative factor. This rules out the possibility of a genuine ionospheric scintillation event, as it does not match the plasma dispersion relation. It does, however, agree with what can be expected from an anomaly in the satellite's oscillator. While the previously reported event could be dismissed as a freak occurrence, it is now apparent that these events are a persistent phenomenon. They have the potential to corrupt geophysical research with false data and to generate false alarms in systems to forewarn of GPS outages due to scintillation...|$|R

In this paper, the problem of aircraft collision detection <b>system</b> using <b>Global</b> <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> carrier-phase information is addressed. A new approach to the carrier-phase-based relative position estimation problem is proposed that uses particle filters in which the samples are drawn from Cartesian position space coordinates. The particle filters with position samples makes the <b>Global</b> <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> carrierphase-based <b>position</b> estimation algorithm robust and practical in that the algorithm is not sensitive to changes of <b>Global</b> <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> satellites and cycle slips. The same algorithm can be used to estimate the vehicle attitude if multiple <b>Global</b> <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> antennas are used. For a reliable and enhanced collision avoidance system, threedimensional trajectories are projected using relative position, velocity, and attitude estimates.
