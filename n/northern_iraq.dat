5|$|The 173d Airborne Brigade {{was made}} part of Task Force Viking, a special {{operations}} {{task force that}} contained elements of the 10th Mountain Division and the 10th Special Forces Group. The use of the 173d {{as a part of}} a special operations task force was a unique first in U.S. Army history. This force was assisted by Kurdish rebels in <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq</b> and tasked with attacking key airfield and oil production positions deep in <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq.</b> The brigade would take off from Aviano Air Base in Italy, a 4½-hour flight from <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq.</b> As the preparations for the brigade were in their final stages, it moved 10 trains and 300 trucks worth of equipment to the air base, as well as 120 busloads of soldiers. Though the brigade's movement was impeded by Italian protestors, the Italian police provided escort operations to the brigade and ensured that it reached the Air Base without incident, and was not significantly delayed. Operation Iraqi Freedom began on 20 March with V Corps, consisting of the 101st Airborne Division, 82nd Airborne Division, and 3d Infantry Division making a forceful push from the south, beginning the Iraq War. A few days later, the 173d and 10th Special Forces Group departed for <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the Brigade saw {{its third}} {{deployment}} to Iraq during the Iraq War, relieving the 45th Sustainment Brigade of its areas of responsibility of Multinational Division, North, comprising {{over a dozen}} Forward Operating Bases. The Brigade deployed to Iraq in fall of 2007 following the Brigade Combat Teams and aviation brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division, however, for this deployment, the unit {{did not support the}} Division directly, as its mission in Multinational Division, North covered facilities management, not unit logistics. Brigade projects focused on building infrastructure throughout <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq.</b> The brigade served a total of 15 months in the country, headquartered at Contingency Operating Base Q-West in <b>Northern</b> <b>Iraq</b> under the command of the 316th Expeditionary Support Command. It was relieved during a change of command ceremony on 9 August 2008, at which time it returned to Fort Stewart. It was replaced by the 16th Sustainment Brigade. Since its return, the brigade participated in an intramural soccer tournament at Fort Benning, something many of its members enjoyed doing, even while deployed.|$|E

Darius fled over the mountains to Ecbatana (modern Hamedan), while Alexander captured Babylon.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February 2004, I Corps forward {{headquarters}} {{deployed to}} Iraq. The element, called Task Force Olympia, deployed to Mosul, Iraq in January 2004, where it assumed its mission from the 101st Airborne Division {{to form a}} headquarters to exercise command and control of all coalition and Iraqi forces in <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq.</b> It coordinated the efforts of both of the active Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, attached engineers, civil affairs, signal, and other supporting units as well as Iraqi security forces, eventually numbering more than 12,000. The Iraqi security forces included four Civil Defense Corps battalions, three Border Police battalions, several thousand members of the Iraq Facility Protection Security Forces and an Armed Forces battalion. After {{more than a year}} in Iraq, the corps forward headquarters handed over responsibility for <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq</b> to the soldiers of Task Force Freedom and 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in February 2005.|$|E

This {{was the first time}} Turkey had mounted a night-bombing operation on a massive scale, and also the largest operation conducted by Turkish Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Under American protection, Iraqi Kurdistan {{had evolved}} into a {{successful}} semi-autonomous region. US pressure helped lead to a peace deal in 1999 between the major Iraqi Kurdish factions, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq. While both parties officially swore off independence, the Turkish government remained sufficiently concerned, and continued to keep troops in <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E
5|$|Yet {{some members}} of the SASR {{continued}} to operate in Iraq {{over the next few years}} in a number of roles. In 2004 claims appeared in the media that Australian special forces were involved in counter-insurgency operations inside Iraq, although this was denied by the government. An SASR team was deployed to Iraq in May and June 2005 as part the effort to free Douglas Wood, an Australian engineer kidnapped in Baghdad; however, he was later recovered alive by US and Iraqi forces. In 2007, British media reports suggested that SASR elements were still operating in Iraq, along the southern border with Iran, targeting arms smugglers. Later, a small number of SASR personnel were deployed to Iraq in June 2014 to protect the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was threatened by the 2014 <b>Northern</b> <b>Iraq</b> offensive, while others were reported to have been tasked with providing security to Royal Australian Air Force aircrew aboard transport aircraft delivering arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish-controlled <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq</b> during September 2014.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, {{the brigade}} {{deployed}} to Iraq {{for its first}} tour in Operation Iraqi Freedom as a sustainment brigade. Its mission in the country was to provide sustainment and force protection operations in support of Multi-National Division North with life support and logistical operations. On 22 July 2008, the brigade's soldiers underwent final preparations before departing Rammstein Air Base for <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq.</b> The brigade operated out of Contingency Operating Base Q-West, which {{was supported by a}} dozen Iraqi small businesses.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014 a {{small number}} of SASR {{personnel}} were deployed to Iraq to protect the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was threatened by the 2014 <b>Northern</b> <b>Iraq</b> offensive. Later, in August and September a number of RAAF C-17 and C-130J transport aircraft based in the Middle East were used to conduct airdrops of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to airlift arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish-controlled <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq.</b> In late September 2014 an Air Task Group (ATG) and Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) were deployed to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. Equipped with F/A-18F Super Hornet strike aircraft, a KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport, and an E-7A Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning & Control aircraft, the ATG began operations on 1 October. The SOTG is tasked with operations to advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces, and was deployed to Iraq after a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments. It began moving into Iraq in early November. In April 2015 a 300-strong unit known as Task Group Taji was deployed to Iraq to train the regular Iraqi Security Forces. Airstrikes were extended to Syria in September 2015.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} war, the GR1s {{switched}} to medium level strike missions, typical targets for these strikes included munition depots and oil refining facilities. Only the reconnaissance Tornado GR1As continued to operate at the low-altitude high-speed profile throughout the war, the GR1A emerged unscathed despite the inherent danger posed by missions such as conducting pre-attack reconnaissance. In the war's aftermath, Britain maintained a {{military presence in the}} Gulf, around half a dozen GR1s were based at Ali Al Salem airbase in Kuwait for operations over the southern no fly zone as part of Operation Southern Watch; another half a dozen GR1s participated in missions over <b>Northern</b> <b>Iraq</b> in Operation Provide Comfort.|$|E
5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq</b> to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.|$|E

Thus, ethnic cleansing was an element of the Ba'thist policy aimed at reducing the influence of the Iraqi Turkmen in <b>northern</b> <b>Iraq's</b> Kirkuk. Those Iraqi Turkmen who remained in cities such as Kirkuk were subject to continued assimilation policies; school names, neighbourhoods, villages, streets, markets and even mosques with names of Turkic origin were changed to names that emanated from the Ba'th Party or from Arab heroes. Moreover, many Iraqi Turkmen villages and neighbourhoods in Kirkuk were simply demolished, particularly in the 1990s.|$|R
