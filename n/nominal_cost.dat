40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the cost of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Teaching University Hospital of Thessaly (TUHT) in 2006 and to demonstrate discrepancies between actual hospitalisation cost and social funds' reimbursement. Methods: Cost analysis was performed using a macro-costing approach, which focused on the estimation of <b>nominal</b> and actual <b>cost</b> per ICU patient. Data were derived from the annual records of resources consumed in each hospital unit and from hospital balance sheets. Sensitivity analysis was also performed by inflating <b>nominal</b> <b>costs</b> to present values. Results: There were 312 patients admitted to the ICU. Mean actual cost per ICU patient was estimated at € 16, 516, whereas actual reimbursement from social funds was only € 1, 671. This means that reimbursement accounted for just 10 of the actual hospitalisation <b>cost.</b> Once <b>nominal</b> <b>costs</b> were inflated to present values, the reimbursement accounted for 25 of the actual hospitalisation cost. The major cost drivers of ICU hospitalisation were personnel costs followed by infrastructure, hotel services and pharmaceutical expenditure. These results may be limited {{by a lack of}} consideration for clinical outcomes along {{with a high level of}} aggregation in cost data. Conclusion: Reimbursement should be re-adjusted in order to balance public hospital deficits and make public-private mix viable. This way, intensive care capacity would increase and allow a more equitable distribution of healthcare resources. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Paley provided network programming to affiliate stations at a <b>nominal</b> <b>cost,</b> thereby ensuring the widest possible distribution for both the programming and the advertising. The advertisers then became the network's primary clients and, because of the wider distribution brought by the growing network, Paley was able to charge more for the ad time.

40|$|Willingness-to‐pay (WTP) {{estimates}} {{derived from}} discrete‐choice experiments (DCEs) generally {{assume that the}} marginal utility of income is constant. This assumption is consistent with theoretical expectations when costs are {{a small fraction of}} total income. We analyze the results of five DCEs that allow direct tests of this assumption. Tests indicate that marginal utility often violates theoretical expectations. We suggest that this result is an artifact of a cognitive heuristic that recodes cost levels from a numerical scale to qualitative categories. Instead of evaluating <b>nominal</b> <b>costs</b> {{in the context of a}} budget constraint, subjects may recode costs into categories such as ‘low’, ‘medium’, and ‘high’ and choose as if the differences between categories were equal. This simplifies the choice task, but undermines the validity of WTP estimates as welfare measures. Recoding may be a common heuristic in health‐care applications when insurance coverage distorts subjects' perception of the <b>nominal</b> <b>costs</b> presented in the DCE instrument. Recoding may also distort estimates of marginal rates of substitution for other attributes with numeric levels. Incorporating ‘cheap talk’ or graphic representation of attribute levels may encourage subjects to be more attentive to absolute attribute levels.

40|$|The {{cost of a}} Software Product Line (SPL) {{development}} project sometimes exceeds the initially planned cost, because of requirements volatility and poor quality. In this paper, we propose a cost overrun simulation model for time-boxed SPL development. The model is an enhancement of a previous model, specifically now including: consideration of requirements volatility, consideration of unplanned work for defect correction during product projects, and <b>nominal</b> project <b>cost</b> overrun estimation. The model has been validated through stochastic simulations with fictional SPL project data, by comparing generated unplanned work effort to actual change effort, and by sensitivity analysis. The result shows that the proposed model has reasonable validity to estimate <b>nominal</b> project <b>cost</b> overruns and its variability. Analysis indicates that poor management of requirements and quality will almost double estimation error, for the studied simulation settings...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} {{the average cost of}} the workers' compensation insurance program for a homogeneous group of employers by state. These estimates are of interest because they reflect the operation, direct <b>nominal</b> <b>costs,</b> and efficiency of workers' compensation. The paper estimates cost equations for a variety of alternative specifications. The main finding is that when cost equations are estimated by ordinary least squares there is a unit elasticity of costs with respect to benefits, but instrumental variable {{estimates of the}} effect of benefits yield a greater than unit elasticity. The results also indicate that the presence of a state insurance fund is associated with higher average costs to employers, all else equal. Finally, we explore the impact that the minimum standards recommended by the National Commission on State Workmen's Compensation Laws would have on workers' compensation costs. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{explain the}} puzzling {{empirical}} {{evidence on the}} investory accounting choice through a management signaling argument. We assert that firms with lower <b>nominal</b> production <b>costs</b> than other firms have relatively less to gain from the tax advantages assocaited with LIFO adoption. For these firms, future <b>nominal</b> production <b>costs</b> are lower due to increased efficiency or technological improvements. Because of asymmetric information about future costs, and the moral hazard problem of direct communication, the managers of the more efficient firms are able to credibly communicate their production superiority by using the FIFO accounting method. We show in this paper that, if firms can choose the fraction of their inventory which is allocated to FIFO and LIFO, then a separating equillibrium exists in which firms with lower production costs signal their greater efficiency by allocating a higher fraction of their invetory to FIFO...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} provincial disparities and {{convergence of}} sectors in China from a labour cost perspective. We {{find that the}} provinces in the Northeast and Coastal regions have strong advantages in the manufacturing sector, while the Primary sector, Construction and Real estate sectors have better cost competitiveness in the Interior and West regions. The decrease of relative unit labour cost (RULC) is mainly due to the faster growth rates of relative labour productivity (RLP) than {{the growth rate of}} relative <b>nominal</b> labour <b>costs</b> (RNLC) in most cases. A decomposition analysis shows that there are much more cost competitiveness gains, as well as relative decrease of <b>nominal</b> labour <b>costs</b> and labour productivity improvement during the period 1978 - 1995 than the years afterwards. We find the fast convergence of RULC is consistent with the fast converging RLP among provinces with static wages, suggesting the importance of institutional factors such as rigid wage setting in Chinese labour markets. ...|$|R
