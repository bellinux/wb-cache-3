Kentucky Kingdom is <b>now</b> <b>open</b> under new operators as of May 24, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Dunrobin's origins {{lie in the}} Middle Ages, {{but most}} of the present {{building}} and the gardens were added by Sir Charles Barry between 1835 and 1850.

The site is <b>now</b> <b>open</b> to visitors twice a year, on the first Saturday in April and October.|$|E
5|$|The mansion, {{abandoned}} due {{to rising}} costs, was demolished in 1972, allowing Wallingford Castle to be declared a scheduled monument {{as well as}} a Grade I listed building. The castle grounds, including the remains of St Nicholas College, two sections of castle wall and the motte hill, are <b>now</b> <b>open</b> to the public. An archaeological research project run by Leicester University conducted a sequence of excavations between 2002 and 2010, aiming to better understand the historical transition from the Anglo-Saxon town of Wallingford and the burgh, to the period of the Norman castle.|$|E
5|$|The western {{entrance}} to the Middle Ward is <b>now</b> <b>open,</b> and a gateway leads north from the ward onto the North Terrace. The eastern exit from the ward is guarded by the Norman Gatehouse. This gatehouse, which, despite its name, dates from the 14th century, is heavily vaulted and decorated with carvings, including surviving medieval lion masks, traditional symbols of majesty, to form an impressive {{entrance to}} the Upper Ward. Wyatville redesigned {{the exterior of the}} gatehouse, and the interior was later heavily converted in the 19th century for residential use.|$|E

5|$|Charles Dickens is {{reputed to}} have set his novel Hard Times in the city, {{and while it}} is partly {{modelled}} on Preston, it shows the influence of his friend Mrs Gaskell. Gaskell penned all her novels, with the exception of Mary Barton, at her residence on Plymouth Grove. On numerous occasions Gaskell's house played host to influential authors including Dickens, Charlotte Brontë, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Charles Eliot Norton. It is <b>now</b> <b>open</b> as a literary museum. Also closely associated with the city is Victorian poet and novelist Isabella Banks, most famed for her 1876 novel The Manchester Man. Anglo-American author Frances Hodgson Burnett was born in the city's Cheetham Hill district in 1849, and wrote much of her classic children's novel The Secret Garden while visiting nearby Salford's Buile Hill Park.|$|E
5|$|Sir Edmund's son Sir Ambrose succeeded him in 1920. His son Sir Arthur {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of {{documentary}} film making in the years prior to, during and after the Second World War, working with John Grierson. He inherited the title on his father's death in 1951. The house was acquired by the Nation, and was given to the National Trust, in part-payment of death duties, in 1960. The West Wing was immediately demolished, being considered to have no architectural or historical significance, to reduce running costs and to return the house to its supposed mediaeval ground plan. Sir Arthur died in 1973 and was succeeded by his son Sir Charles. The Elton family is still resident in the house, which is <b>now</b> <b>open</b> to the public.|$|E
5|$|The North Front defences, still {{following}} the course {{laid out by}} the Moors in the 11th century, are still substantially intact. A {{significant portion of the}} original Spanish and Moorish walls can still be seen, rising in a saw-tooth (en crémaillère) fashion from the Grand Battery. Although gaps have been cut in the walls to allow vehicle traffic to enter the city centre, pedestrians can still walk over the wooden drawbridge over the North Front ditch to pass through the Landport Gate into the city. The Moorish Tower of Homage continues to stand above the Grand Battery on the lower slopes of the Rock. It is <b>now</b> <b>open</b> to the public as part of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve.|$|E

5|$|The barn {{was briefly}} in royal {{ownership}} but {{passed into the}} hands of three families who continued to use it for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s. It was subsequently owned by a property development company which redeveloped the farm complex. After the company went bankrupt in 2006, the barn was bought by property speculators betting on its compensation value if the nearby Heathrow Airport was expanded. The barn fell into disrepair and was closed to the public for all but one day a year. English Heritage stepped in, using a rare legal procedure to carry out repairs without the owner's consent, and eventually purchased the barn in January 2012. It is <b>now</b> <b>open</b> to the public from April to October on the second and fourth Sunday of each month under the management of the Friends of the Great Barn group.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} built and added to over many years. The great hall and chapel block are the {{earliest}} surviving parts of the structure with the west wing being added around 1570, when the windows and decoration {{of the rest of}} the building were changed. Further construction and adaptation was undertaken in the 18th century when it was owned by the Elton baronets. The house was acquired by the nation and was given to the National Trust in part-payment for death duties in 1960. The Elton family is still resident in the house, which is <b>now</b> <b>open</b> to the public.|$|E
5|$|From the 18th century onwards, the {{interior}} of the castle was converted to provide accommodation for the Lord Wardens, almost all of which is <b>now</b> <b>open</b> to visitors. The castle is still entered through the ground floor of the gatehouse in the western bastion, which contains the original porter's lodge. In the middle of the castle is the keep, which originally housed the Servants' Hall and now a set of tea rooms. In the southern bastion is a set of rooms which are reached through the Hall Room, originally built as gunners' lodgings in the 18th century and converted into the entrance hall to the castle in the 1930s. On {{the far side of the}} bastion are the Sackville and Willingdon Rooms, built in the 18th century; the Willingdon Room is now used as a museum for objects relating to William Pitt. The Lucas Room has been redecorated in a mid-19th century style and is used to present various items of Wellington memorabilia. The north and east bastions are filled in, providing solid foundations for the gun platforms above.|$|E
