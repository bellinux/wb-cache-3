40|$|The {{entry of}} third party payors {{into the field}} of health care has brought about {{increasing}} awareness of cost-effectiveness. Since breast biopsy is among the most commonly performed operations and open to criticism, the purpose of this report is to provide data relative to cost-effectiveness of breast biopsies at the University of New Mexico and to compare such data with 1) cost-effectiveness of mammographic screening for breast cancer, and 2) cost-effectiveness of judicious use of mammography in patients with breast complaints. From 1972 through 1978, 1064 patients were seen because of complaints relative to the breasts and 516 breast biopsies were done. Seventy patients were found to have cancer (14 % of the breast biopsies). Using the October 1978 through March 1979 cost schedules for hospital and professional fees, the average cost of a breast biopsy was $ 1, 216. 00 for general anesthesia, $ 751. 00 <b>for</b> assisted <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> and $ 520. 00 <b>for</b> <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> The major differences lay in 1) anesthesia and operating room average charges of $ 618. 00 for general anesthesia, $ 451. 00 <b>for</b> assisted <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> and $ 260. 00 <b>for</b> <b>local</b> anesthesia; 2) room charge of $ 174. 00 for general anesthesia; and 3) laboratory and x-ray charges of $ 256. 00 for general anesthesia, $ 120. 00 <b>for</b> assisted <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> and $ 91. 00 <b>for</b> <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> In 1978 64 % of breast biopsies were done under <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia</b> as opposed to 1972 when 22 % were done under <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> <b>For</b> the 516 breast biopsies, 47 % were done under <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> 4 % under assisted <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia</b> and 49 % under general anesthesia. The calculated overall cost of the 516 breast biopsies was $ 448, 794. 00 or $ 6411. 00 per cancer. Comparing our data to those of Lewis at our 1978 - 79 cost schedules and assuming our anesthetic mix in his patients, his cost per cancer identified was $ 3973. 00 in patients with breast complaints. His cost figure is considerably lower than ours because of a higher yield of cancer (41 %). Making the same assumptions for cost and anesthetic mix, the cost per biopsy proved cancer diagnosed in mammographic screening for breast cancer is $ 11, 175. 00 (Feig), and $ 24, 482 (Lewis). Thus, 1) use of <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia</b> rather than general anesthesia reduces cost of breast biopsies by $ 694. 00 per breast biopsy, 2) greater precision in selection of patients for breast biopsies is mandatory to reduce cost of diagnosis of cancer, 3) present state of the surgical art is more cost-effective than is screening for breast cancer...|$|R

40|$|Background: Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) {{injections}} are {{an effective}} treatment for controlling hyperhidrosis at sites of amputation. Hyperesthesia associated with amputated limbs {{is a major}} barrier to performing this procedure under <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> Objective: To present a novel method <b>for</b> improving <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia</b> with BTX-A injections. Methods & Results: A 29 -year-old military veteran with a below-the-knee amputation of his right leg was suffering from amputation site hyperhidrosis, which was impeding his ability to comfortably wear a prosthesis. Prior to presenting to our clinic, the patient received one treatment of BTX-A injections to his amputation stump while under general anesthesia for surgical repair of trauma-related injuries. In our dermatology clinic, we repeated the procedure using topical lidocaine-prilocaine (30 gm total) <b>for</b> <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> This provided effective relief of hyperhidrosis for 6 months, but the procedure was very painful (9 / 10 intensity). We repeated the same procedure 6 months later, using ice in addition to topical lidocaine-prilocaine (30 gm) <b>for</b> <b>local</b> anesthesia; this resulted in reduced pain (3 / 10 intensity) for the patient. Conclusions: We suggest using ice in combination with a topical anesthetic as an effective method for pain control that avoids general anesthesia in treating amputation-associated hyperhidrosis. ...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY In <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> various {{epinephrine}} concentrations {{are applied}} for its vasoconstrictive effect. This {{study was conducted}} to observe the effect of epinephrine on intraoperative bleeding and also to evaluate hemodynamic changes during skin surgery. Ninety-six patients scheduled for skin surgery un-der <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia</b> were divided into three groups administered three different concentrations of epinephrine (1 : 50, 000, 1 : 100, 000 and 1 : 200, 000) with 1 % lido-caine (an average of 5. 7 mL). The rate of bleeding and hemodynamic changes were assessed during surgical procedure. The surgeon’s rating of intraoperative bleeding was significantly lower in the group administered epinephrine concen-tration of 1 : 50, 000 as compared with the group on epinephrine concentration of 1 : 200, 000. However, {{there was no significant difference}} between the groups administered epinephrine concentrations of 1 : 200, 000 and 1 : 100, 000. Except for diastolic blood pressure at 1 min after injection of local anesthetics, transient changes of hemodynamic parameters were observed, with no statistically sig-nificant difference among the three anesthetic solutions used. It is concluded that, <b>for</b> <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia,</b> the rate of intraoperative bleeding is influenced by epi-nephrine concentration, and that 1 : 50, 000 epinephrine provides optimal clinical efficacy <b>for</b> the <b>local</b> bleeding control during dermatologic surgery...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Epinephrine {{containing}} {{local anesthetics}} are used hemostasis in many cases. Otolaryngologists typically selected to decrease bleeding in surgery field for operations such as especially FESS (Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery), septoplasty, septorhinoplasty.

Presentation of case: We presented intracranial hemorrhagic infarction in a 41 -year-old male patient after using lidocaine with epinephrine <b>for</b> <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia</b> on nasal mucosa.

In our case, a hemorrhagic infarction developed after giving the adrenaline/lidocaine infiltration {{to make up a}} <b>local</b> <b>anesthesia</b> in the mucosa of the septum. There is not any reported case like this in the literature. Conclusion: We want to emphasize that all surgeons especially the ENT surgeons should be careful while using local anesthetic medicines which contains adrenaline for rare complication of intracranial hemorrhagic infarction.
