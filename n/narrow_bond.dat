40|$|Anaerobic {{adhesives}} {{cured by}} a redox initiated free radical mechanism {{have been known}} in industry for over two decades. A typical formulation contains monomer, stabilizers, accelerators, a fluorophore used as an inspection aid, and various other ingredients to modify polymer properties and rheology. Conventional technology for in situ characterization is difficult to apply to anaerobic polymerization due to the unique requirements of this system. These include exclusion of oxygen, <b>narrow</b> <b>bond</b> gaps, {{and the presence of}} a transition metal. By taking advantage of the presence of the fluorophore and working within the constraints of the system, a new cure monitoring method has been developed. The application of UV-Vis spectroscopy has shown that the absorption of the fluorophore does not change during polymerization implying that it does not participate in the process. Fluorescence spectroscopy in contrast, has shown that collisional quenching of the fluorophore occurs in the presence of an amine that is commonly used as a cure accelerator. By monitoring the change in fluorescence, room temperature reactions have been characterized. In addition, the same quenching mechanism has been used to calculate activation energies. Polymerization results also show excellent correlation with FTIR techniques. ...|$|E

Potentials with more extended interactions that retain the EHM symmetry are shown to have a less cooperative CDW transition with higher U^* and wider BOW phase. Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is used to obtain E_m directly as the singlet-triplet gap, with finite E_m marking the BOW boundary V_s(U). The BOW/CDW boundary V_c(U) is obtained from exact finite-size calculations {{that are consistent with}} previous EHM determinations. The kinetic energy or bond order provides a convenient new estimate of U^* based on a metallic point at V_c(U) for U < U^*. Tuning the BOW phase of half-filled Hubbard models with different intersite potentials indicates a ground state with large charge fluctuations and magnetic frustration. The possibility of physical realizations of a BOW phase is raised for Coulomb interactions. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figure...|$|E

The transducer operates at similar frequency of the commercial lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers (∼ 65 kHz). Because of the better matching of the acoustic impedances between the ceramic and titanium alloy, an effective transfer of vibration energy is achieved in the transducer, leading to a large axial vibration (1. 73 μm at 0. 1 W). Moreover, the transducer exhibits a small lateral vibration (0. 05 μm at 0. 1 W), which is essential for producing a small or <b>narrow</b> <b>bond.</b> The transducer has successfully bonded the aluminum wire on the standard die and gold-plated PCB. The bonds are of good quality, having a smaller deformation ratio (as compared to the commercial PZT transducer) and high bond strength (exceeding the industrial requirement).

Because of the space-demanding properties of dmpu upon coordination, dmpu solvated metal ions often show coordination numbers lower than those found in corresponding hydrates and solvates of oxygen donor solvents without steric requirements beyond {{the size of the}} donor atom. All lanthanoid(III) ions are seven-coordinate in solution, except lutetium(III) which is six-coordinated in regular octahedral fashion, whereas in the solid iodide salts the dmpu solvated lanthanoid(III) ions are all six-coordinate in regular octahedral fashion, A comparison of Ln-O bond lengths in a large number of lanthanoid(III) complexes with neutral oxygen donor ligands and different configurations shows that the metal ion-oxygen distance is specific for each coordination number with a <b>narrow</b> <b>bond</b> distance distribution. This also shows that the radius of the coordinated oxygen atom in these compounds can be assumed to be 1. 34 angstrom as proposed for coordinated water, while for ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (thf) it is somewhat larger. Using this atomic radius of oxygen in coordinated water molecules, we have calculated the ionic radii of the lanthanoid(III) ions in four- to nine-coordination and evaluated using the bond lengths reported for homo- and heteroleptic complexes in oxygen donor solvates in solution and solid state.

40|$|For {{this thesis}} work, {{equilibrium}} (EMD) and non-equilibrium (NEMD) molecular dynamics simulations {{have been used}} to determine the underlying structural and dynamical processes in solution phase reactions involving diatomic solutes. This characterization is necessary to predict solvent effects on process involving larger molecules. The impulsive photodissociation of mercuric iodide in ethanol, HgI 2 → HgI + I, produces highly vibrationally excited HgI with <b>narrow</b> <b>bond</b> length distributions. This {{has been used as a}} prototype to study wavepacket motion, vibrational relaxation and rotational dynamics. The vibrational energy decay rate of HgI obtained from the EMD simulations is in quantitative agreement with the experimentally determined value. Energy dissipation is mainly facilitated by the Lennard-Jones force fluctuations. The NEMD simulations support the experimental observation of the vibrational wavepacket motion on the rotational dynamics of the HgI which strongly depends on the variations in the partial charges of HgI with internuclear distance. Another system considered in this thesis work, the aqueous hypochlorite ion, undergoes light induced charge shifting from the negatively charged O atom (ClO−) to the Cl atom (OCl−). The charge shifting event, ClO− → OCl−, is used as a prototype to study solvation dynamics. The NEMD simulations predict that solvent response occurs on two timescales which are close to those measured by experiments on the same system. The rapid and slower time components have been associated with the destruction of solvent structure around the O atom and the creation of a new structure around the Cl atom, respectively. The applicability of linear response to this process is also examined with an eye toward possible future experiments. The curvatures of the harmonic free energy surfaces of ClO− and OCl − are not the same indicating that there is nonlinearity in the solvation dynamics caused by the asymmetry of the system: The average solvent structures around the two forms are not interchangeable. This study has shown the importance of incorporating the change in effective atomic radii during an electronic transition, if necessary with a corresponding modification of Lennard-Jones potential parameters. ...|$|E

40|$|Ab initio quantum {{chemical}} calculations {{have been}} used to explore the P 3 H 3 potential energy surface focussing on the ring-chain rearrangements of the three-membered ring in (PH) (3) (1), the parent triphosphirane. Relative energies between stationary points were estimated using the QCISD(T) / 6 - 311 G(d,p) method based on MP 2 / 631 G(d,p) geometries and corrected for zero-point contributions. Ring strain, proton affinities, ionization and excitation energies and heats of formation have been evaluated using larger basis sets, e. g. 6 - 311 ++G(3 df, 2 p). The cyclic trans-triphosphirane (1 a) is the most stable P 3 H 3 isomer and lies about 40 kJ/mol below the open-chain phosphanyldiphosphene (H 2 P-P=PH). The decrease of ring strain in three-membered rings when CH 2 is replaced by PH is confirmed. Triphosphirane 1 a is a virtually strain-free ring and even gains some stabilization relative to three separate P-P single bonds. The reduced ring strain also helps diminish the phosphorus inversion barrier to 224 kJ/mol compared to the monocyclic isomers of (CH 2) (PH) (2) and (CH 2) (2) (PH) Compound la follows a pure ring-opening or a 1, 2 -hydrogen shift rather than a combined motion pathway, in fundamental contrast with corresponding processes of diphosphirane and phosphirane. This is due to the existence of an open-chain P 3 H 3 phosphorane intermediate stabilized by allylic conjugation. The pericyclic ring-opening of 1 a is the most favored process but the energy barrier in the gas phase is about 180 kJ/mol high. Electron density is largely delocalized within the three-membered P- 3 ring not only in the C- 3 v-symmetric 1 b (all-cis) but also in 1 a (C-s). The proton affinity of 1 a {{is similar to that of}} PH 3. The proton affinities decrease with n in cyclo-(CH 3) (3 -n) (PH) (n) and their values were obtained: PA(1 a) = 777 +/- 10, PA(diphosphirane) = 799 +/- 10 and PA(phosphirane) = 802 +/- 10 kJ/mol. Heats of formation are evaluated as follows (Delta H degrees(fo) at 0 K in kJ/mol) : 1 a, 70 +/- 10; cyclo-(PH) (2) (PH 2) (+) (protonated 1 a), 821 +/- 10; diphosphirane, 85 +/- 10; cyclo-(CH 2) (PH) (PH 2) (+) (protonated diphosphirane), 814 +/- 10; phosphirane, 86 +/- 10; and protonated phosphirane, 812 +/- 10 kJ/mol. All P rings remain cyclic following ionization to the radical cations. Adiabatic ionization energies (IEa) are estimated as: la and diphosphirane, 9. 3 +/- 0. 3 eV and phosphirane 9. 5 +/- 0. 3 eV. The first UV absorption band shifts toward the longer wavelength region on going from phosphirane to 1 a. The GIAO/B 3 LYP computed magnetic shieldings for la and related molecules reveal a clear relationship between the <b>narrow</b> <b>bond</b> angles in the rings and their unusually strong magnetic shielding. The similarity of the predicted P- 31 -NMR signals in la and its heteroanalog diphosphirane, (CH 2) (PH) (2), can be rationalized in terms of a compensation of the carbon-substituent effect [downfield shift) and the bond-bending effect imposed by the ring (upfield shift). status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Copper {{wire bonds}} have {{replaced}} gold wire bonds {{in the majority}} of commercial semiconductor devices for the latest technology nodes. Although economics has been the driving mechanism to lower semiconductor packaging costs for a savings of about 20 % by replacing gold wire bonds with copper, copper also has materials property advantages over gold. When compared to gold, copper has approximately: 25 % lower electrical resistivity, 30 % higher thermal conductivity, 75 % higher tensile strength and 45 % higher modulus of elasticity. Copper wire bonds on aluminum bond pads are also more mechanically robust over time and elevated temperature due to the slower intermetallic formation rate - approximately 1 / 100 th that of the gold to aluminum intermetallic formation rate. However, there are significant tradeoffs with copper wire bonding - copper has twice the hardness of gold which results in a <b>narrower</b> <b>bonding</b> manufacturing process window and requires that the semiconductor companies design more mechanically rigid bonding pads to prevent cratering to both the bond pad and underlying chip structure. Furthermore, copper is significantly more prone to corrosion issues. The semiconductor packaging industry has responded to this corrosion concern by creating a palladium coated copper bonding wire, which is more corrosion resistant than pure copper bonding wire. Also, the selection of the device molding compound is critical because use of environmentally friendly green compounds can result in internal CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion) mismatches with the copper wire bonds that can eventually lead to device failures during thermal cycling. Despite the difficult problems associated with the changeover to copper bonding wire, there are billions of copper wire bonded devices delivered annually to customers. It is noteworthy that Texas Instruments announced in October of 2014 that they are shipping microcircuits containing copper wire bonds for safety critical automotive applications. An evaluation of copper wire bond technology for applicability to spaceflight hardware may be warranted along with concurrently compiling a comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanisms involved with copper wire bonded semiconductor devices...|$|R

Despite the reduced number of parameters in comparison with other pore-network models, the morphological characteristics of HYPON compare well to those of the process-based predictive models in literature, and these characteristics are sensitise to the variance of porebody sizes rather than to the used type of the porebody size distributions. Processes such as diagenesis and dissolution are captured implicitly through the pore wall curvature parameter. Different combinations of porosity and permeability relations are obtained if the bond curvature and porebody sizes are varied. These relations reveal that effects of diagenesis and dissolution on the permeability may be ignored as they are secondary to effects on porosity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The values obtained by Mozzi and Warren [3] are Θ ~ 144 °, and ΔΘ]FWHM ~ 30 °, whereas the studies in [19] obtained values of Q ~ 148 ° and ΔΘ]FWHM ~ 13 – 15 ° that were essentially the same as those calculated in [16]. The Bell and Dean model of [15] in Fig. 2 gave a Si–O–Si bond angle of 152 °, and also wide bond angle distribution with a FWHM ~ 15 °. Of particular significance is the significantly <b>narrower</b> Si–O–Si <b>bond</b> angle distribution of the calculations in [18], and the X-ray diffraction studies of [19]. The bond angles and bond distributions of [16, 18, 19] have important implications for the existence of high symmetry six member Si–O rings their importance as the primitive ring structure in both α-quartz and β-quartz, as well as non-crystalline SiO 2.|$|R

Sending money home to the family goes beyond responding to financial need, for remittances are alsQ one of the markers of continued belonging to the family. Our paper draws on {{the first stage of}} our qualitative research on remittances. It is based on participant observation and open-ended interviews of 19 middle-income direct and multiple migrants from the Indian diaspora in Australia. When the nuclear family migrates together, we find that family boundaries <b>narrow</b> and the <b>bonds</b> with the extended family become progressively diluted, despite communication and a flow of money. The sense of belonging to the family gets tested with inheritance. In our sample, women, as in India, continue to cede their claims to their brothers. We found that even some men did not claim their inheritance. Our paper contributes to the literature on remittances and the transnational family by focusing on money as a medium of family relationship and care. The study privileges the perspective of direct and multiple migrants, compared with most of the economic literature that emphasises the impact of remittances on the recipients. By connecting money, family, care and belonging, we connect the economic and social study of remittances...|$|R
40|$|Many viruses {{rely on the}} {{self-assembly}} {{of their}} capsids to protect and transport their genomic material. For many viral systems, in particular for human viruses like hepatitis B, adeno or human immunodeficiency virus, that lead to persistent infections, capsomeres are continuously produced in the cytoplasm of the host cell while completed capsids exit the cell for {{a new round of}} infection. Here we use coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations of a generic patchy particle model to elucidate the role of the dynamic supply of capsomeres for the reversible self-assembly of empty T 1 icosahedral virus capsids. We find that for high rates of capsomere influx only a <b>narrow</b> range of <b>bond</b> strengths exists for which a steady state of continuous capsid production is possible. For bond strengths smaller and larger than this optimal value, the reaction volume becomes crowded by small and large intermediates, respectively. For lower rates of capsomere influx a broader range of bond strengths exists for which a steady state of continuous capsid production is established, although now the production rate of capsids is smaller. Thus our simulations suggest that the importance of an optimal bond strength for viral capsid assembly typical for in vitro conditions can be reduced by the dynamic influx of capsomeres in a cellular environment.

30|$|Based on {{previously}} reported data at 0  °C, ∆G E and ∆G D of human GLUT 1 {{are estimated to}} be + 2.8 RT and + 0.2 RT, respectively (Lowe and Walmsley 1986). The small value of ∆G D suggests that K d,in and K d,out are nearly identical and that differential binding energy contributes almost zero to the driving force for GLUT 1. Thus, what actually drives the transport process in this case can only originate from the ∆G L and ∆G R terms, by favoring the forward movement and/or preventing the backward movement (Zhang and Han 2016). In addition, in both the absence and presence of substrate, GLUT 1 stays predominantly in the Cin state (with f(0) =  0.06 and f(∞) =  0.07), which is in agreement with the above-mentioned positive value of ∆G E. A recently reported 1.5 -Å crystal structure of GLUT 3 (PDB ID: 4 ZW 9) (Deng et al. 2015) revealed that a substrate glucose molecule forms multiple hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues from the central cavity of the transporter, and the binding site is relatively <b>narrow.</b> The hydrogen <b>bonds</b> (i.e., the enthalpy term in ∆G L or ∆G R) contribute favorably to both substrate affinity and selectivity. However, while the narrow binding site contributes positively to the substrate selectivity, it negatively affects the affinity because of a decrease in entropy (see Appendix 1). Then, how these thermodynamic parameters are related to the kinetic properties of a uniporter remains to be discussed.|$|R

We report a metal-insulator transition in Sr 3 Ir 2 O 7 via either dilute electron doping (La 3 + for Sr 2 +) or application of high pressure up to 35 GPa. Our study of single-crystal Sr 3 Ir 2 O 7 and (Sr 1 -xLax) 3 Ir 2 O 7 reveals that application of high hydrostatic pressure P leads to a drastic reduction in the electrical resistivity {{by as much as}} six orders of magnitude at a critical pressure, PC = 13. 2 GPa, manifesting a closing of the gap; but further increasing P up to 35 GPa produces no fully metallic state at low temperatures, possibly as a consequence of localization due to a <b>narrow</b> distribution of <b>bonding</b> angles θ. In contrast, slight doping of La 3 + ions for Sr 2 + ions in Sr 3 Ir 2 O 7 readily induces a robust metallic state in the resistivity at low temperatures; the magnetic ordering temperature is significantly suppressed but remains finite for (Sr 0. 95 La 0. 05) 3 Ir 2 O 7 where the metallic state occurs. The results are discussed along with comparisons drawn with Sr 2 IrO 4, a prototype of the Jeff = 1 / 2 insulator. Comment: five figure...|$|R
40|$|With Plasmon Hybridization (PH) and Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method, we {{theoretically}} {{investigated the}} optical properties of some complex metallic nanostructures (coupled nanoparticle/wire, nanostars, nanorings and combined ring/disk nanocavity systems). We applied the analytical formulism of PH studying the plasmonic coupling of a spherical metallic nanoparticle and an infinite long cylindrical nanowire. The plasmon resonance of the coupled system is shown shifted in frequency, which highly {{depends on the}} polarization of incident light relative to the geometry of the structure. We also showed the nanoparticle serves as an efficient antenna coupling the electromagnetic radiation into the low-energy propagating wire plasmons. We performed an experimental and theoretical analysis of the optical properties of gold nanorings with different sizes and cross sections. For light polarized parallel to the ring, the optical spectrum sensitively depends on the incident angle. When light incidence is normal to the ring, two dipolar resonance is observed. As the incident light is titled, some previously dark mulipolar plasmon resonances will be excited {{as a consequence of}} the retardation. The concept of plasmon hybridization is combined with the power of brute-force numerical methods to understand the plasmonic properties of some very complicated nanostructures. We showed the plasmons of a gold nanostar are a result of hybridization of the plasmons of the core and the tips of the particle. The core serves as a nanoantenna, dramatically enhanced the optical spectrum and the field enhancement of the nanostar. We also applied this method analyzing the plasmonic modes of a nanocavity structure composed of a nanodisk with a surrounding minoring. For the concentric combination, we showed the nature of the plasmon modes can be understood as the plasmon hybrization of an individual ring and disk. The interation results in a blueshifted and broadened superradiant antibonding resonance and a redshifted and <b>narrowed</b> subradiant <b>bonding</b> plasmon. The electric field enhancement of the subradiant mode is significantly larger compared with its parent plasmon modes. For the nonconcentric ring/disk nanocavity, we showed the symmetry breaking caused the coupling betweem different multipolar plamons which results in a tunable Fano resonance. We also show the subradiant and the Fano resonances could be particularly useful in the LSPR and SERS sensing applications. In the thesis, we also presented an efficient dielectric function of gold and silver that is suitable for the FDTD simulations of the optical properties of various nanoparticles. The new dielectric function is able to account for the interband transition in gold and silver, and provides more precise calculations of the optical spectra compared to the Drude dielectric function that is normally used previously...|$|R
