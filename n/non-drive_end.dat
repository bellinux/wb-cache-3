5000|$|In March 1973 {{a team of}} Matra {{engineers}} led by Georges Pinardaud {{completed the}} initial design for project M560, {{which was to be}} a more powerful Bagheera. A key part of the project was the creation of a unique [...] "U engine" [...] out of two existing Simca straight-4 engines. The blocks came from two different Simca applications and rotated in opposite directions but shared the same 1294 cc displacement. One block was from the 1100Ti and was adapted to transverse mounting while the other was from the Simca 1000 Rallye II in which it had been mounted longitudinally. The two blocks were joined at an 82° angle using a common cast-aluminum sump that also carried a common oil supply for the engine. At the <b>non-drive</b> <b>end</b> another aluminum casting assured the alignment of the blocks while at the drive end a steel adapter fit the ends of both crankshafts. A sprocket and Morse chain from each crankshaft were connected to a 0.9 in shaft running {{down the middle of the}} sump that transmitted power from the left-hand crank to the right. Each block retained its own crankshaft, distributor, and water pump. The clutch and bell-housing of the engine from the Rallye II engine provided the transaxle mounting while a flywheel was only mounted to the 1100Ti crankshaft. The resulting [...] 8-cylinder assembly was fitted with four Weber 36 DCNF carburetors and, with a 9.8:1 compression ratio, produced [...] @ 6200 rpm and 216 Nm @ 4000 rpm.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 1990 ´s pod {{propulsion}} in marine applications have become common. There are mainly two manufactures on the pod market. ABB is the biggest producer and has two types of pod-types, Azipod (5 - 30 MW) and Compact (0. 4 - 5 MW). Rolls-Royce (RR) is the second biggest company on the market, producing a pod called Mermaid (5 - 25 MW). The electrical system in pod propulsion normally consists of a transformer, a frequency converter and an electric motor. The transformer is used to divide the system into several parts in order to obtain different voltage levels but also for phase shift voltages for the used rectifiers. The purpose of the frequency converter is to control the speed and torque of the motor by changing a constant frequency from the main generator into variable frequency for the motor. The electric motor is used for conversion from electrical to mechanical power for the propeller. Azipod has a synchronous motor controlled by a cyclo converter and dry type transformer. The <b>non-drive</b> <b>end</b> bearing is insulated and the shaft is grounded to earth in drive end and to the bearing housing in <b>non-drive</b> <b>end.</b> Mermaid has a dry type transformer and a synchronous motor controlled by a load commutated inverter (LCI). Both bearings are insulated and the shaft is grounded at the drive-end. The biggest change in pod propulsion within the foreseeable future is a switch to voltage source inverter with pulse-width-modulation (VSI-PWM). Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) are an alternative in smaller pods and the development of magnets can make PMSM to an alternative for bigger pods. In addition, induction motors is an alternative motor in the future. I...|$|E

There are two categories of causes of bearing current, a classical problem where low frequency current and a newer high frequency current problem that occur when using high switching control. To mitigate currents in bearings grounding of the shaft and insulation of the bearings is used. Azipod has a synchronous motor controlled by a cyclo converter and dry-type transformer.

40|$|Case StudyThe {{intent of}} this case study is to {{illustrate}} how rotor dynamics analysis can become an effective tool to improve rotor stability. Analytical method, such as undamped planar critical speed map is {{used to evaluate the}} vibration characteristics of a gearbox. Currently, advanced rotor dynamics software provides greater capability in generating and analyzing rotor models. By removing undesirable instability sources and ensuring reliable separation margin, successful rotor-stability improvement is validated. This case illustrates a rotor dynamics analysis applied on a high speed pinion of a speed increasing gearbox, which was exhibiting high vibration during operation. Analytical results predicted rotor instability due to the coincidence of the seven times operating speed and its fourth natural planar frequency. Based on recent investigation, this phenomenon is inherent to gear design, and can be controlled by adding or removing weight on the <b>non-drive</b> <b>end</b> of the high speed pinion without major modifications on the gearbox. Thanks to the rotor dynamics analysis model, the cause of the vibration was found and the gearbox redesigned, avoiding expensive down time to the users...|$|E
