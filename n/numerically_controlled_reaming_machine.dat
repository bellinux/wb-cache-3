This was first impulse for entrance of electronics and later computer technology into the production support. However, more extensive development of CAM systems was enabled by creating {{the conception of}} the computer <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> (CNC) production machines which is dated to 1970. Since the CAM systems allow the data about product geometry, which has been created by CAD system, to be used directly for creating NC programs for NC and CNC production machines...|$|R

40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} process of cylindrical cams with <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> milling machines, the programming {{as well as the}} machining of accurate profiles normally turn out to be problematic. In an effort to overcome some of these problems the machine tool builder, MAHO (Germany), had during 1990, supplemented its <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> units with an option with which cylindrical interpolation is made possible. With this option programming is considerably simplified in some cases, but serious limitations necessitate in many instances that the option cannot be applied at all. The limitations of the option and how to overcome them, are illustrated and discussed in a typical programming example...|$|R
