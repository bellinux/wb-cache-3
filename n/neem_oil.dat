5|$|Siddiqui was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to bring the anthelmintic, antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral constituents of the Neem tree {{to the attention of}} natural products chemists. In 1942, he extracted three bitter compounds from <b>neem</b> <b>oil,</b> which he named as nimbin, nimbinin, and nimbidin respectively. The process involved extracting the water-insoluble components with ether, petrol ether, ethyl acetate and dilute alcohol. The provisional naming was nimbin (sulphur-free crystalline product with melting point at 205°C, empirical composition C7H10O2), nimbinin (with similar principle, melting at 192°C), and nimbidin (cream-coloured containing amorphous sulphur, melting at 90–100°C). Siddiqui identified nimbidin as the main active antibacterial ingredient, and the highest yielding bitter component in the <b>neem</b> <b>oil.</b> These compounds are stable and found in substantial quantities in the Neem. They also serve as natural insecticides.|$|E

Pasteurized milk samples (63 o C for 30 minutes) were treated by <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> in concentration (0. 25, 0. 50, and 1. 00 gm/l of milk) and inoculated with E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The samples were stored at 7 oC for 36 hr, while at 300 C the samples were stored for 12 hr, and microbial examination as well as titratable acidity were determined. The results indicated that the concentration of <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> did not significantly (P> 0. 05) affect the count of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus at 7 oC, while the count of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was affected (P 0. 05) affected by the concentration of <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> at 30 oC, however, the count of E. coli was affected (P 0. 05) affected by concentration of <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil,</b> while the storage period slightly affected the acidity of milk sample...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the performance of <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> as a cutting fluid in orthogonal machining of aluminium-manganese alloy 3003, carbide cutting tool insert {{was used as a}} cutting tool under different machining parameters of spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut with different types of cutting fluids (<b>neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> and soluble oil) as well as dry machining. The results were obtained in terms of the average surface roughness of the machined workpiece and flank wear under different cutting parameters (spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut). The results indicated that the <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> cutting fluid reduced the surface roughness by 39 % and 22 % as compared to dry turning and soluble oil cutting respectively. It was established from the results that the <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> cutting fluid reduced the flank wear by 72 % and 56 % as compared to dry turning and soluble oil cutting respectively. Based on the study, it can be concluded that <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> cutting fluid facilitates a better surface finish and substantial reduction in tool wear when compared with dry and soluble oil machining...|$|R
30|$|The {{variation}} of enzyme concentration and reaction time on conversion yield {{is shown in}} Fig.  2 c. At lower enzyme concentration, initial conversion yields for mango oil were {{greater than that of}} neem up to about 20  h reaction time. After 20  h that of shea oil was greater than that of mango oil. At high enzyme concentrations conversion yields increased with reaction time and attained steady values for both mango and shea oils. Conversion yields were higher for shea oils compared to mango and <b>neem</b> <b>oils.</b> Variation of conversion yields for <b>neem</b> <b>oils</b> under these conditions was not significant. Maximum yields for shea oils were obtained at the highest enzyme concentration. At prolonged reaction times, conversion yields decreased probably due to aggregation of enzymes after long reaction times. In fact it was visually observed that enzymes aggregated and settled {{at the bottom of the}} reaction flask for most of the experimental runs that lasted more than 24  h.|$|R
25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and <b>neem</b> <b>oil.</b> Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E

40|$|Upland rice {{is mostly}} {{at risk from}} soil-borne insect pests, {{including}} termites, which cause significant crop yield losses. Studies were conducted in 2005 and 2006 at Ikenne, southwest Nigeria to assess the effectiveness of two traditional practices (cow dung and red palm oil mixed with pawpaw), two plant extracts (<b>neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> and <b>neem</b> powder) and Furadan coated with garri (cassava flour) against termite attacks on nine rice varieties—NERICAs 1 – 7, LAC 23 and OS 6. In 2005, {{the results showed that}} <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> was more effective than neem powder and cow dung in the control of termites. Of the five treatments in 2006 (Furadan coated with garri, <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil,</b> <b>neem</b> powder, cow dung and red palm oil mixed with pawpaw), two treatments—neem seed oil and Furadan coated with garri—gave the best protection against termite attack. Among the rice varieties, termite attack was significantly lower on NERICA 5 than on the other NERICA varieties in both years. NERICA 5 was apparently the least attacked by termites when unprotected, indicating that it {{could be used as a}} resistant check variety for termites. Yield losses were lower in the treated than in the control plots. These findings indicate that botanicals, such as <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil,</b> can provide effective control against termites on rice fields and can also be used as alternatives to persistent chemical pesticides. This study has far-reaching implications because <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> is environmentally safe, easy to prepare, readily available and affordable by resource-poor farmers in Nigeria.

Through detached leaf-disk assay, the highest mean preventative effect (97. 74 %) was recorded by <b>neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> followed by jojoba oil (89. 82 %) and extract of Rynoutria sachalinensis (82. 77 %). <b>Neem</b> seed <b>oil</b> at 1 % {{was the most}} effective agent followed by jojoba oil and extract of R. sachalinensis at 1. 5 % and 2 %, respectively, where they suppressed E. cichoracearum completely.

30|$|Considering the {{combined}} effect of temperature and reaction time the observed decreased conversion yields of mango oil at higher temperatures {{was linked to}} the denaturation of the enzymes at higher temperatures as earlier adduced. There was however no significant difference on neem and shea yields {{as a result of the}} interaction effect of reaction time and temperature even at higher temperatures. This difference in the behavior of the conversion yields of the oils indicate that the lipozyme enzyme used in this work could be more tolerant to high temperatures in <b>neem</b> and shea <b>oils</b> compared to mango oils. It may be possible that mango oil may have some specific compound that may denature/deactivate the enzyme. This assertion requires further analysis. Again under these conditions shea conversion yields were for most of the times higher than those obtained with mango and <b>neem</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|R
30|$|Note that maximum yields were highest for shea <b>oils</b> {{compared}} to <b>neem</b> and mango <b>oils.</b> This {{was attributed to}} {{the high levels of}} free fatty acids (15.18  ±  0.25  %) in shea oil {{compared to}} 0.95  ±  0.05 and 2.42  ±  0.29  % for mango and <b>neem</b> <b>oils.</b> Table  2 clearly indicates that under the same conditions for most of the experiments the conversion yields varied in direct proportion with the acid value of the oil. That is, conversion yields were highest for shea, followed by neem and mango. One advantage of enzyme catalyzed transesterification reactions is that oils with high FFA can be easily converted to MEs without prior treatment as done in chemical catalysis, probably because no energy needs to be expended by the enzyme-based process to separate the FFA from the glycerol backbone (Lai et al. 2005).|$|R
