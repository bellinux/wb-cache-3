25|$|In the United Kingdom and Canada, notably on extra-urban roads, a solid {{white or}} yellow line {{closer to the}} driver is used to {{indicate}} that <b>no</b> <b>overtaking</b> is allowed in that lane. A double white or yellow line means that neither side may overtake.|$|E
25|$|The race {{begins with}} a warm-up lap, after which the cars {{assemble}} on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap {{is often referred to}} as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with <b>no</b> <b>overtaking</b> (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground provided he has not fallen to the back of the field). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid.|$|E
500|$|Alesi {{attacked}} Briatore's role {{in preventing}} the drivers from abiding by the pact {{that was to}} see <b>no</b> <b>overtaking</b> {{in the first two}} chicanes and told the Italian and French media that some team principals threatened their drivers if they did not race. Nevertheless, he was relieved that the race passed without any major incident and said the reason why the majority of the drivers supported Michael Schumacher was that he [...] "behaved like a perfect leader". Villeneuve said to British television station ITV that he felt discussing a <b>no</b> <b>overtaking</b> pact at the race circuit was not the appropriate place: [...] "We are race car drivers, Because we signed contracts before the season and everyone was happy to be a race car driver and to earn millions of dollars. Because we knew a year ago {{that there would be a}} race at Monza and nobody complained." [...] FIA president Max Mosley stated that he disagreed with the pact and said that the drivers should have raised the concerns in the months leading up to the Grand Prix.|$|E

The plan failed, with Villeneuve, Benetton team principal Flavio Briatore and Arrows owner Tom Walkinshaw refusing to accept the pact. Schumacher had been keen to avoid any accidents at the start, due {{to a combination of}} the effects of the 11 September 2001 attacks earlier that week; the death of fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti in a pile-up at the beginning of the previous year's race; and the horrific accident in the previous day's ChampCar race in Germany, in which former Formula One driver Alex Zanardi was critically injured, resulting in the amputation of both legs.|$|E
