5|$|From 21 April 2001, Live & Kicking began {{broadcasting}} from BBC Scotland in Glasgow and saw Farley, Cawood and Deley {{joined by}} Heather Suttie who replaced Hill. The set {{remained the same}} after having been transported up to Glasgow from London, however a new seating area was added, consisting of pouffes and beanbags. The feel of the show also changed and was also split into three sections. The first hour became Kicking Toons which bunched all the cartoons together, the <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> would feature {{the main components of}} Live & Kicking including the games and sketches and the final hour became Live & Loud which featured all the music performances.|$|E
5|$|At 08:30 Robertson and Lalor {{decided to}} take their {{companies}} up Baby 700. Instead of going round to the right like Tulloch, they went straight up the centre, crossed over the summit onto the northern slope and went to ground. A spur on their left, leading to Suvla Bay, was defended by a Turkish trench system. At 09:15 Turkish troops started moving down Battleship Hill, and for the <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> they exchanged fire. Where the spur joined Baby 700, a group of Australians from the 9th, 11th, and 12th Battalions crossed Malone's Gully and charged the Turkish trench. A Turkish machine-gun on Baby 700 opened fire on them, forcing them back, followed by a general withdrawal of Australian troops. The Turks had secured Battleship Hill and were now driving the Australians off Baby 700. From his headquarters {{at the head of}} Monash Valley, Maclagen could see the Turks attacking, and started sending all available men towards Baby 700.|$|E
5|$|For the <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> and a {{half the}} frigates poured shot into one another at close range, until Cooke was struck by grape shot at 01:30 on 1 March, {{replaced}} by his first lieutenant Lucius Hardyman. For another hour the action continued, French fire gradually slackening until it stopped completely at 02:30, by which time only four French guns remained operational. Hardyman hailed to ask whether Forte had surrendered but the French did not reply and he ordered another broadside. A second hail also brought no response but sailors were seen attempting to repair the rigging on Forte. Concerned that the French were attempting to escape, Hardyman concentrated his fire on the masts of Forte, bringing them crashing down one by one until at 03:00 Forte was completely dismasted. With all resistance ended, British merchant prisoners on board Forte emerged from below decks and hailed Sybille, requesting a boat be sent across so that British Lieutenant Nicholas Manger could formally take the surrender of the French ship.|$|E
50|$|After leaving Ofotfjord, U-47 spotted and {{attacked}} HMS Warspite. One torpedo detonated {{ahead of the}} battleship, while another detonated far behind. U-47 spent the <b>next</b> <b>hours</b> submerged under persistent depth charge attack.|$|R
5000|$|Around 30â€”35 {{opposition}} youth activists organised {{a protest}} {{in front of}} Baku's City Hall on 15 November chanting [...] "Freedom!" [...] but were soon violently confronted by police forces. The arrested activists were released within the <b>next</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of March 18, 1990, guards at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston {{admitted}} two men posing as police officers responding to a disturbance call. Once inside, the men tied up the guards and, over the <b>next</b> <b>hour,</b> stole 13 works of art valued at $500 millionthe largest-value theft of private property in history. Despite efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and multiple probes around the world, no arrests have been made and no works have been recovered. The museum initially offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to their recovery, but in 2017 this was doubled temporarily to $10 million with an expiration date set {{to the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{was scheduled}} to begin shortly following the misdirected airstrike, and was to be preceded by an artillery bombardment with high explosive and smoke at 16:00. The American tanks were subsequently moved forward to provide cover, and when the New Zealand artillery failed to fire at the appointed hour, they provided the direct fire support. Still in contact, the Australians began to pull back, fighting a number of well-disciplined rearguard actions as the companies leapfrogged each other. Meanwhile, the New Zealand artillery kept the Chinese at bay, after it finally commenced firing. B Company had taken 39 Chinese prisoners during the earlier fighting, and unable to leave these behind, {{they were used to}} carry many of the Australian wounded and much of their equipment as well. O'Dowd's fear that the Chinese might have blocked the withdrawal route was not realised, and B Company moved back along the ridge and down to the ford without incident, reaching the Middlesex area after dark. C Company was the next to withdraw, departing at 16:30, just after suffering another casualty from sniper fire. Saunders led his company up the spur and then south down the main ridge without incident, followed by A Company during the <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> with the Chinese in close pursuit.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, 1947, around 8:00a.m. {{smoke was}} spotted {{in the cargo}} hold of the Grandcamp {{while she was still}} moored. Over the <b>next</b> <b>hour,</b> {{attempts}} to extinguish the fire or bring it under control failed as a red glow returned after each effort to douse the fire.|$|E

50|$|Thistlewood {{thought the}} act would trigger a massive {{uprising}} against the government. James Ings, a coffeeshop keeper and former butcher, later {{announced that he}} would have decapitated all the cabinet members and taken two heads to exhibit on Westminster Bridge. Thistlewood spent the <b>next</b> <b>hours</b> trying to recruit more men for the attack. Twenty-seven men joined the effort.|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} part of the channel's presentation since launch has been {{the top of the hour}} countdown sequence, since there is no presentation system with continuity announcers so the countdown provides a link to the beginning of the <b>next</b> <b>hour.</b> A similar musical device is used on BBC Radio 5 Live, and mirrors the pips on BBC Radio 4.|$|E
25|$|On 30 September, Blackpool faced Leyton Orient at Bloomfield Road. Andy Morrell {{opened the}} scoring after 21 minutes, and that's how matters {{remained}} for the <b>next</b> <b>hour.</b> On 81 minutes, Orient {{were reduced to}} ten men when Adam Tann was sent off. Wes Hoolahan converted the resulting penalty, and Keigan Parker found the net four minutes later for Blackpool's third and final goal.|$|E
25|$|Over the <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> both fleets {{attempted}} to make long-range torpedo runs with their destroyer groups, without success. At 16:40, the Italian air force made an attack with 126 aircraft, reporting damage on Eagle, Warspite and Malaya; because of some misunderstanding, 50 of the Italian aircraft also attacked the Italian ships, without damage. The battle ended at 16:50 with both sides withdrawing.|$|E
50|$|Late in September, a {{vigorous}} tropical wave moved off {{the west coast}} of Mexico. By October 1, the National Hurricane Center issued a high probability (over 50% chance of development in the <b>next</b> 48 <b>hours)</b> for development into a tropical cyclone, but as the wave stalled offshore, it began losing vigor, with the NHC reducing the likelihood to medium (20-50% chance for development in the <b>next</b> 48 <b>hours)</b> the <b>next</b> day. As of 2100 UTC October 3, the likelihood of development within the <b>next</b> 48 <b>hours</b> was high again. Then, late that night, the wave developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E, and then into Tropical Storm Norbert 24 hours later.|$|R

25|$|The {{event-driven}} SOA software could {{shut off}} the heating element of water heaters to the pre-set response limits established by individual homeowners. For example, if the market price of electricity for a given hour exceeded the home owner's limit, the home owner could plan to go without recharging the water's hot temperature for that hour, when prices were high, and opt to delay the hot water temperature recharge to the <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> when electricity market prices might be lower.|$|E
25|$|The light {{construction}} and hollow {{nature of the}} structures allowed the jet fuel to penetrate far inside the towers, igniting many large fires simultaneously over a wide area of the impacted floors. The fuel from the planes burned at most for a few minutes, but {{the contents of the}} buildings burned over the <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> or hour and a half. It has been suggested that the fires might not have been as centrally positioned, nor as intense, had traditionally heavy high-rise construction been {{standing in the way of}} the aircraft. Debris and fuel would likely have remained mostly outside the buildings or concentrated in more peripheral areas away from the building cores, which would then not have become unique failure points. In this scenario, the towers might have stood far longer, perhaps indefinitely. The fires were hot enough to weaken the columns and cause floors to sag, pulling perimeter columns inward and reducing their ability to support the mass of the building above.|$|E
25|$|The third match {{followed}} {{a very similar}} pattern to the second, with the West Indians making a good start through Roach (53) and Challenor (46), but no other batsman getting beyond the 30s. The total of 238 was, though, the highest of the series for the touring side. Hobbs and Sutcliffe made 155 for the first wicket, and Hobbs and Tyldesley then added 129 before Hobbs was out for 159 with the score at 284. Five further wickets then fell in the <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> for 49 runs, {{all of them to}} Griffith, whose innings figures of six for 103 were the best of the series for the West Indies. Tate and Harold Larwood then added 61 in 25 minutes and the last three wickets made 105 runs. West Indies' second innings, as in the previous Tests, began badly, and only a stubborn 41 from Martin enabled the side to reach three figures. As at Lord's and Old Trafford, the match was over before lunch on the third day.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} departed Monto a {{few minutes}} after 11:00 on a direct track towards Caboolture carrying the pilot and five non-paying passengers. The weather for the flight was expected to be VFR (visual flight rules) conditions with good visibility, high clouds and light winds. At 13:15, the aircraft contacted air traffic control, reporting an approximate position 69km north of Caboolture and requesting assistance with navigation. Shortly after, the pilot issued a distress call as the aircraft had entered thick cloud. Controllers in Brisbane then communicated positional information to the aircraft directly and relayed via other pilots in the area due to difficulties with radio reception. A friend of one of the passengers aboard Riama {{received a phone call from}} the aircraft, reporting that they were lost in cloud and unable to maintain altitude at around 13:20. Over the <b>next</b> <b>hour,</b> witnesses in the area around the crash site reported seeing the aircraft flying in and out of cloud at low level. At 13:48, the pilot reported he had one hour of fuel remaining and the last transmission from the aircraft came at 14:04. Neither the aircraft or the pilot were equipped or certified to fly without visual reference to the ground.|$|E
25|$|David Sheppard and Ray Illingworth both {{suffered}} from throat infections {{from the previous}} day and while Sheppard came to play after seeing a doctor, but Illingworth {{was sent back to}} the hotel to recover. Even if Dexter had wanted to go for the runs England's dismal start would have curtailed his ambitions. David Sheppard was caught - eventually - by Wally Grout on the first ball of the second over from Ken Mackay (1/13) to give him his 50th Test wicket and Geoff Pullar edged the ball to Simpson in the next over from McKenzie (1/63) to reduce England to 4/2. Ken Barrington and Colin Cowdrey saw the innings safely through the <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> and a half, adding 94 before he was run out by Norm O'Neill for 32. Barrington looked completely assured and began sweeping the Australian spin bowlers as Benaud, Simpson and O'Neill all tried their arm. Dexter was out to one-handed catch by Simpson off Benaud with 100 minutes to go and Ray Illingworth was recalled from the hotel in case he needed to bat, but he was not needed. A ball from McKenzie struck a nerve in Tom Graveney's arm, but after he recovered he settled down to a polished innings to accompany Barrington to his hundred. This was reached with a pull for six off Simpson over long-on, his seventh Test century and his first against Australia. Strangely, the stonewalling Barrington would bring up a Test century four times with a six and he hit another in the same over. Benaud brought in the new ball and gave it to Bill Lawry who nearly knocked Barrington's cap off with a beamer that went for 4 byes followed this with 4 wides, as extras were not counted against the bowler in those days this counted as a maiden. Barrington finished with 2 sixes and 16 fours in his 132 not out and he and Graveney (36 not out) played out the day with an unbeaten partnership of 101 to take England to 223/4.|$|E
