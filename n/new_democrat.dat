5|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, Sarnia's voters have been moderate, {{and the party}} {{affiliation}} of its Members of Parliament, both provincial and federal, has swung back and forth largely between the Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties (a <b>New</b> <b>Democrat</b> was elected in their 1990 provincial wave).|$|E
5|$|During the mid nineties, Moran co-founded {{and later}} co-chaired the <b>New</b> <b>Democrat</b> Coalition, a {{coalition}} of Democratic lawmakers who consider themselves to be moderates with regard to commerce, budgeting, and economic legislation, but vote as liberals on social issues. Moran was {{also a member of}} the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), the largest caucus operating within the Democratic caucus, which works to advance progressive issues and opinions. He joined the caucus prior to the 111th Congress.|$|E

5|$|In June 2008, three senior health {{officials}} {{announced that they}} would be leaving the province's employment at the expiration of their contracts in August. Liepert blamed their departures on better offers from other employers, although <b>New</b> <b>Democrat</b> leader Brian Mason speculated that the government's health restructuring may have been to blame. Detractors pointed out that the optics of allowing the employees to depart for more money elsewhere soon after the government had approved a substantial pay hike for cabinet ministers were not good.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to being}} elected to Congress, {{he worked as}} an {{executive}} in a private equity firm and as an attorney. In 2006 he ran in the Democratic primary for New York Attorney General, but came in third to Mark J. Green and winner Andrew Cuomo. He {{was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives in 2012 after defeating Republican incumbent Nan Hayworth. He campaigned for the election as a moderate {{and is a member of}} the <b>New</b> <b>Democrat</b> Coalition. He is the first openly gay person to be elected to Congress from New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{the media}} speculated that Clinton {{would enter the}} Presidential race after {{incumbent}} New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and {{twice as long as}} it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the <b>New</b> <b>Democrat</b> wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.|$|E

50|$|McRobb and Fairclough soon {{moved to}} the Liberal caucus, {{reducing}} Hardy's <b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> to third party status and elevating the Yukon Liberal Party to Official Opposition. The move prompted the <b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> to table legislation preventing MLAs from crossing the floor without an ensuing election, but the legislation was never adopted. McRobb and Fairclough were elected comfortably as Liberals in the 2006 election later that same year and the Liberals retained their Official Opposition status. Hardy's <b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> remained the third party.|$|R

25|$|An ongoing {{issue in}} Canadian {{politics}} is the imbalance between the genders in selection by political parties of candidates. Although {{in the past}} some parties, particularly the <b>New</b> <b>Democrats,</b> {{have focused on the}} necessity of having equal gender representation in Parliament, no major party has ever nominated as many or more women than men in a given election. In 2006, the <b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> had the highest percentage of female candidates (35.1%) of any party aside from the Animal Alliance, which only had one candidate, its leader, Liz White. The proportion of female <b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> elected was greater than the proportion nominated, indicating female <b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> were nominated in winnable ridings. 12.3% of Conservative candidates and 25.6% of Liberal candidates were female.|$|R

2500|$|An early {{poll showed}} the NDP {{in third place}} with 18% support, well behind the {{governing}} Progressive Conservatives and also behind the Liberals. [...] The Liberal campaign faltered, however, and the <b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{were able to make}} strong gains in the election's final days, partly buoyed by the unexpected victory of Bob Rae's <b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the neighbouring province of Ontario. [...] The Progressive Conservatives won a narrow majority with 30 seats, while the <b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> won 20 and the Liberals seven. [...] Doer succeeded Carstairs as Leader of the Opposition in the legislature.|$|R
50|$|<b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{were also}} more open to {{deregulation}} than the previous Democratic leadership had been.

50|$|Despite their victory, the Liberals {{had been}} {{consistently}} several points behind the opposition <b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> in every {{public opinion poll}} throughout the campaign. Even poll results released on the very {{last day of the}} campaign suggested that the <b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> had an eight to nine percentage point margin over the Liberals. Only one pollster, Forum Research, had released a poll which suggested that the Liberals were close enough that a victory was even possible for them, although even that poll had the <b>New</b> <b>Democrats</b> ahead by two percentage points. The Liberals' upset victory led to significant media debate about the quality of opinion polling in Canadian elections.|$|R
