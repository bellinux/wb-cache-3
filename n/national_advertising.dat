5|$|In 1996 {{the company}} {{repaired}} {{its relationship with}} its franchisees by immediately dropping the most contentious of the contract terms that had been proposed by chairman John Cranor five years previously. The 1976 contract was restored, including the 1.5 mile outlet exclusivity zone, while the parent company gained greater control over <b>national</b> <b>advertising.</b> Novak also axed the Colonel's Rotisserie Gold product and introduced a new non-fried item called the Tender Roast. Tender Roast was served by piece, as with the fried chicken, {{in contrast with the}} rotisserie product, which had been sold in quarter, half or whole chicken portions. Afterwards, Novak oversaw ten fiscal quarters of consecutive growth at KFC North America. As a result of his success at KFC North America, Novak became President and CEO of the entire KFC organization in 1996.|$|E

The Sun reported that Richie banned Waterman from appearing in the series remake, but Richie told fans to ignore this story, saying it would be an honour to be in the company of Waterman and Cole, let alone work with them on television. On 31 May 2009, UK newspaper The Mirror reported that, due to alleged poor ratings, Channel 5 would not be commissioning a new series of Minder.|$|E
25|$|There were {{protests in}} Tasmania and {{mainland}} Australia at the flooding {{of the original}} lake, before, during and after construction of the dams. Protests began when in 1967 the Tasmanian Government revoked {{the status of the}} Lake Pedder National Park that had protected the lake since 1955. The role of the HEC as a surrogate wing of the Tasmanian government was perceived when the political or wider social dissent against the HEC power over the Tasmanian environment seemed impregnable. Tasmania's political leader, Premier Eric Reece and Allan Knight, the HEC Commissioner, were seen as the leading proponents of the 'damming' of Tasmania against any opinion to the contrary, and were not averse to taking their opinions to statewide and <b>national</b> <b>advertising</b> campaigns asserting their right to dam the lake.|$|E

25|$|In 1998 local {{programming}} {{on almost}} all Classic Hits stations was reduced {{down to a}} 4-hour breakfast show between 6am and 10am. By using new satellite networking technology, Classic Hits stations were able to have local shows at breakfast time, and have network shows presented from the Classic Hits Auckland studios with local advertisements, weather forecasts and breakouts at other times of the day. The local stations remained commercially viable in otherwise unviable markets and the network was able to invest in its brand and programmes. The company was able to leverage its reach for <b>national</b> <b>advertising</b> clients, including agency campaigns. At this stage Classic Hits 98FM in Christchurch was exempt from these changes and continued to run local shows 24 hours a day. Local content was also retained in Auckland as network presenters began presenting separate voice breaks for local Auckland listeners.|$|E

In order to fund nationwide advertising campaigns, the Kentucky Fried Chicken Advertising Co-Op was established, giving franchisees ten votes and the company three when deciding on budgets and campaigns. In 1969, KFC hired its first <b>national</b> <b>advertising</b> agency, Leo Burnett. A notable Burnett campaign in 1972 was the [...] "Get a bucket of chicken, have a barrel of fun" [...] jingle, performed by Barry Manilow.

500|$|In May 2014, Nestlé Purina Petcare began a {{legal dispute}} with Blue Buffalo {{regarding}} its advertising practices.

Blue Buffalo advertised that its products contain no meat byproduct or corn, whereas Purina said independent lab tests confirmed that they do. Blue Buffalo made similar allegations against Purina in a counter-suit {{less than a week}} later. It also alleged Purina was engaging in what it characterized as a [...] "smear campaign". The <b>National</b> <b>Advertising</b> Review Board and the [...] Advertising Self-Regulatory Council found that Blue Buffalo's advertising was misleading and its claims that competitors were hiding information about their ingredients were unsubstantiated.

500|$|The network had {{initially}} planned to place Star Trek in the 7:30pm Monday-night time slot freed up by The Man from U.N.C.L.E. completing its run. Instead, the enraged George Schlatter forced the network to insert Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In into the slot, and Roddenberry's series {{was moved to}} 10:00pm on Fridays. Realizing the show could not survive in that time slot and burned out from arguments with the network, Roddenberry resigned from the day-to-day running of Star Trek, although he continued to be credited as executive producer. Roddenberry cooperated with Stephen Edward Poe, writing as Stephen Whitfield, on the 1968 nonfiction book The Making of Star Trek for Ballantine Books, splitting the royalties evenly. Roddenberry explained to Whitfield: [...] "I had to get some money somewhere. I'm sure {{not going to get}} it from the profits of Star Trek." [...] Herbert Solow and Robert H. Justman observed that Whitfield never regretted his 50-50 deal with Roddenberry, since it gave him [...] "the opportunity to become the first chronicler of television's successful unsuccessful series." [...] Whitfield had previously been the <b>national</b> <b>advertising</b> and promotion director for model makers Aluminum Model Toys, better known as [...] "AMT", which then held the Star Trek license, and moved to run Lincoln Enterprises, Roddenberry's company set up to sell the series' merchandise.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but responded by saying that, [...] "Literally every business in America falls under the Commerce Committee" [...] and that he restricted those contributions to $1,000 and thus {{was not part of}} the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. [...] In that year, Time magazine named McCain as one of the [...] "25 Most Influential People in America". [...] McCain used his chairmanship to challenge the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns and reduce the number of teenage smokers, increase research money on health studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. [...] The industry spent some $40–50million in <b>national</b> <b>advertising</b> in response; while McCain's bill had the support of the Clinton administration and many public health groups, most Republican senators opposed it, stating it would create an unwieldy new bureaucracy. The bill failed to gain cloture twice and was seen as a bad political defeat for McCain. [...] During 1998 a revised version of the McCain-Feingold Act came up for Senate consideration; in addition to banning soft money, it sought to restrict [...] "issue ads" [...] run by independent groups within 60 days of an election. While having majority support, it was fiercely opposed by Senator Mitch McConnell on free speech and partisan threat grounds, and it again fell victim to a filibuster and failed to gain cloture.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Philadelphia Media Holdings' acquisition, The Inquirer saw larger than expected revenue losses, mostly from <b>national</b> <b>advertising,</b> and continued loss of circulation. The revenue losses caused management to cut four hundred jobs at The Inquirer and Daily News {{in the three years}} since the papers were bought. Despite efforts to cut costs, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on February 21, 2009. Philadelphia Media Holdings was about US$390 million in debt, due to money borrowed to buy The Inquirer and Daily News. The bankruptcy {{was the beginning of a}} year-long dispute between Philadelphia Media Holdings and its creditors. The group of creditors, which included banks and hedge funds, wanted to take control of Philadelphia Newspapers LLC themselves and opposed efforts by Philadelphia Media Holdings to keep control. Philadelphia Media Holdings received support from most of the paper's unions and launched a public-relations campaign to promote local ownership. A bankruptcy auction was held on April 28, 2010. The group of lending creditors and a group of local investors allied with Brian Tierney both bid for Philadelphia Newspapers, but the lenders had the winning bid. The deal fell through after the group of lenders, under the name of Philadelphia Media Network (PMN), was unable to reach a contract agreement with the union representing the company's drivers. Philadelphia Newspapers, represented by Lawrence G. McMichael of Dilworth Paxson LLP, challenged the right of creditors to credit bid at a bankruptcy auction. [...] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that credit bidding was not permitted.|$|E
