However, tunnels along the Israeli border serve a purely military purpose.|$|E
25|$|After the Six-Day War of 1967, Israeli archeologists began {{a series}} of {{excavations}} near the site at the southern wall that uncovered finds from the Second Temple period through Roman, Umayyad and Crusader times. Over the period 1970–88, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnels</b> were excavated in the vicinity, including one that passed {{to the west of the}} Mount and became known as the Western Wall Tunnel, which was opened to the public in 1996. The same year the Waqf began construction of a new mosque in the structures known since Crusader times as Solomon's Stables. Many Israelis regarded this as a radical change of the status quo, which should not have been undertaken without first consulting the Israeli government. The project was done without attention to the possibility of disturbing historically significant archaeological material, with stone and ancient artifacts treated without regard to their preservation.|$|E

500|$|Williamson {{subsequently}} {{ordered the}} US 1/503rd Battalion—under {{the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel John Tyler—to change the direction of its advance. During the morning the battalion had conducted platoon-sized patrols south, south-west and west, locating a well-constructed defensive position, including bunkers and trenches connected by tunnels. With no contact as yet made with the Viet Cong, the battalion prepared {{to move to a}} new AO in the north by 13:30. During this move the battalion, and armour from Troop D, US 16th Cavalry Regiment, engaged a dug-in Viet Cong Main Force company less than [...] west of the Australians. Following air-strikes and heavy artillery bombardment the communists withdrew, leaving 29 dead during a sharp engagement. The US 2/503rd Battalion had also sent out a number of squad-sized patrols during the day, but no recent signs of Viet Cong activity were found, and only minor sniper fire encountered. However, like the Australians, the American paratroopers also uncovered a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnels</b> and other fortifications.|$|E
500|$|Fort Eben-Emael, which {{measured}} , {{had been}} built during the 1930s, and completed by 1935, by blasting the required space out of marl. It possessed walls and roofs composed of [...] thick reinforced concrete, as well as four retractable casemates and sixty-four strongpoints. The fort was equipped with six 120mm artillery pieces {{with a range of}} ten miles, two of which could traverse 360 degrees; sixteen 75mm artillery pieces; twelve 60mm high-velocity anti-tank guns; twenty-five twin-mounted machine-guns; and some anti-aircraft guns. One side of the fort faced the canal, whilst the other three faced land and were defended by minefields; deep ditches; a [...] high wall; concrete pillboxes fitted with machine-guns; fifteen searchlights were emplaced on top of the fort; and 60mm anti-tank guns. A large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnels</b> ran beneath the fort, connecting individual turrets to the command centre and the ammunition stores. The fort also possessed its own hospital and living quarters for the garrison, as well as a power station that provided electricity to power the guns, provide internal and external illumination, and to power the wireless network and air-purifying system used by the garrison.|$|E
500|$|The {{width of}} {{the front of the}} attack was [...] and the {{distance}} between the two trench lines was about [...] To reduce the distance to be crossed, the Australians projected a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnels</b> towards the Ottoman trenches from The Pimple. Immediately after the attack, one of these tunnels was to be opened along its length to make a communications trench through which reinforcements could advance without having to cross the exposed ground. Some of the attackers would have to make the advance over open ground from the Australian trench line. To provide some measure of protection for these men, three mines were set by engineers to make craters in which they could seek shelter. The preliminary bombardment was stretched over three days—initially confined to a limited [...] "slow shoot", building up to a final intense bombardment an hour before the assault—and was successful in cutting much of the barbed wire that the Ottomans had placed in front of their position. The preparation stage of the attack began at 2:00p.m. on 6 August, when the Australians detonated the three mines they had dug in front of the Ottoman lines, in an attempt to create cover for the advancing troops. Two and a half hours later the final heavy preliminary bombardment commenced, with Australian, British and New Zealand artillery batteries firing on the Ottoman trench line, while naval gunfire support from the British cruiser HMS Bacchante provided counter-battery fire on Ottoman artillery positioned along Third Ridge. Retreating into tunnels which had been cut as part of mining operations, the majority of the forward Ottoman troops were able to find shelter from the bombardment that lasted for an hour.|$|E
50|$|The {{morphology}} of {{both the}} Dee and Mersey estuaries is in large part owed {{to the passage of}} Irish Sea Ice southwestwards over the relatively soft sandstones of the area.

40|$|International audienceThe {{pre-emption}} mechanism {{may be used}} in Multi Protocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) {{networks in}} order to reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> rejected <b>tunnels</b> during failure.

Two approaches are proposed: A pre-emption reduction approach where the least preempted tunnels are preempted in priority and a pre-emption limitation approach where a tunnel cannot be preempted more than N times during a given period. Simulation results show that we can limit the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pre-emptions for a given tunnel to only one, without significantly diminishing the rejection reduction capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — MPLS TE Fast Reroute {{proposes a}} local {{protection}} mechanism to quickly reroute protected TE LSPs onto precomputed and signaled bypass tunnels. This paper explores {{the case of}} multiple network element failure scenarios. The undesired complexity inherent to the multiple failure scenario originates {{from the fact that}} those failure scenarios are more disruptive, and may require multiple bypass tunnels to cope with. The objective {{of this paper is to}} adapt the MPLS local recovery schemes to multi-failure scenarios, while controlling the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> bypass <b>tunnels</b> that are required. This objective is achieved by mapping multi-failure scenarios onto Probable Failure Patterns (PFP’s). PFP’s are characterized by their probability (or frequency) of occurrence during the network lifetime. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> bypass <b>tunnels</b> is then computed to effectively cope with the PFP’s according to their frequency or probability of occurrence. It is shown that by properly choosing how the PFP’s are grouped, and how the corresponding bypass tunnels are computed, it is possible to trade the required <b>number</b> <b>of</b> bypass <b>tunnels</b> for their average length and outage probability, i. e., the probability that the local recovery scheme cannot cope with the occurrence of a multi-failure pattern.

40|$|ABSTRACT ⎯ To {{improve the}} {{operation}} error {{caused by the}} thermal fluctuation of electrons, we propose a novel single-electron pass-transistor logic circuit employing a multiple-tunnel junction (MTJ) scheme and modulate a parameters of an MTJ single-electron tunneling device (SETD) such as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnel</b> junctions, tunnel resistance, and voltage gain. The operation of a 3 -MTJ inverter circuit is simulated at 15 K with parameters Cg=CT=Cclk= 1 aF, RT= 5 MΩ, Vclk= 40 mV, and Vin= 20 mV. Using the SETD/MOSFET hybrid circuit, the charge state output of the proposed MTJ-SETD logic is successfully translated to the voltage state logic.
