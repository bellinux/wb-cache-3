Jones denied assaulting Powell-Lexing, saying he would <b>never</b> <b>get</b> into a physical fight with a woman. Jones was charged with assault. Despite the alleged assault, Powell-Lexing continued as part of Bell's defense team.|$|E

Other sources say it was Charles of Anjou who orchestrated the reduction of the diet of the cardinals to bread and water and removal the roof of the Papal Palace.|$|E

5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could <b>never</b> <b>get</b> over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|In the Cambridgeshire {{over nine}} furlongs on 27 October, St. Gatien, now undefeated in eleven races, started 2/1 {{favourite}} {{in a field}} of twenty-seven. He was prominent throughout the race but could <b>never</b> <b>get</b> on level terms with the filly Plaisanterie who won impressively by two lengths carrying 124 pounds. St. Gatien was involved in a close race for the minor places and finished fifth, just behind Bendigo, Eastern Emperor and Caltha. He had no chance with the winner, but may have been unlucky not to finish second. Two days after losing his unbeaten record, St. Gatien returned to his favoured staying distance in the Jockey Club Cup. He started at odds of 1/8 and won the race very easily, beating Lavaret by fifteen lengths.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} and Gandhi's non-violent {{response to}} it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi {{to the belief that}} Indians will <b>never</b> <b>get</b> a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to Swaraj or self rule and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind him, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had the political support and the attention of the British Raj.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Eddie {{continues}} to persuade his superiors {{to form a}} task force to hunt down the Flash, expressing his zero tolerance for vigilantes. When an enraged and jealous Barry, as Flash, makes an attempt on Eddie, Oliver tries to stop Barry, and the two engage in a fight. Oliver manages to wrangle Barry long enough for Harrison Wells and Joe to use colored strobe light to reset Barry's emotional state. Afterward, Barry and Oliver capture Bivolo and place him in the prison at S.T.A.R. Labs. Due to the incident, Eddie gets the grounds to form a police task force to arrest the Flash. Barry confirms Oliver's belief that the former has a lot to learn. Oliver advises him to stay away from Iris West, with whom Barry is in love, because men with secret identities <b>never</b> <b>get</b> the girl. Oliver asks Team Flash to keep his alter ego a secret. A new metahuman able to manipulate fire appears in Central City.|$|E
