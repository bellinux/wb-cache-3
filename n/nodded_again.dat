60|$|She <b>nodded</b> <b>again</b> wonderingly. Then {{she caught}} his hand appealingly.|$|E
60|$|The captain, who was {{watching}} an outward-bound barque, <b>nodded</b> <b>again,</b> absently.|$|E
60|$|She <b>nodded</b> <b>again,</b> with {{a return}} of her usual sweet composure.|$|E
6000|$|MacIan did {{not even}} notice the incongruous phrase [...] "my friend", but <b>nodding</b> <b>again</b> and again, drew his sword and flung the {{scabbard}} far behind him in the road.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is Billy boy dead?' She nods. 'Was {{he killed}} in action? Tell me, tell me!' She <b>nods</b> <b>again.</b> 'Good for Billy boy. I knew Billy boy was all right. Don't cry, Ellen. I'll {{take care of}} you. All's well with Billy boy.' ...|$|R
60|$|She hesitated as if {{struck by}} a {{deference}} she was not accustomed to. Then she took his hands in hers and dragged him out a little away from Brown, whom she gave a curt <b>nod.</b> <b>Again</b> she looked Pan up and down.|$|R
60|$|I drew {{a little}} closer to her. She <b>nodded</b> <b>again</b> several times.|$|E
60|$|An exclamation of {{surprise}} broke from James Standing, but Pengarvan only <b>nodded</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Stephen's {{expression}} {{must have}} satisfied him, but he <b>nodded</b> <b>again,</b> more vigorously than before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear, no, ma'am, nobody {{suspected}} you! Well, Edmund," [...] he continued, {{returning to}} the former subject, posture, and voice, as soon as Lady Bertram began to <b>nod</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "but this I will maintain, that we shall be doing no harm." ...|$|R
60|$|He was <b>nodding</b> <b>again</b> by that time, but he {{held his}} mother's hand fast with 'Don't go, Mam!' Nor did she. She had asked no questions. To be alone with her boy and Him, whom she thanked with her whole soul, was enough for her at present.|$|R
6000|$|PROF. [Suddenly {{aware of}} something] She'll get her throat bad. [He is silent {{as the voice}} swells in the distance] Sounds queer at night-H'm! [He is silent--Yawning. The voice dies away. Suddenly his head nods; he fights his drowsiness; writes a word or two, <b>nods</b> <b>again,</b> and in twenty seconds is asleep.] ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Vyner <b>nodded</b> <b>again,</b> and {{bending down}} pretended {{to glance at}} some papers on his table.|$|E
60|$|Abner Power <b>nodded</b> <b>again,</b> his {{complexion}} being peculiar--which might partly {{have been}} {{accounted for by}} the reflection of window-light from the green-baize table-cloth.|$|E
6000|$|Cheyne <b>nodded</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "Give one of {{the boys}} your rifle, and step back with Mrs. Grant in the meanwhile. You are on parole." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Again</b> George <b>nodded,</b> and <b>again</b> {{felt that}} squeeze at his heart.|$|R
60|$|The walrus {{looked at}} John as if expecting some {{demonstration}} of practical insanity, but, finding him outwardly calm, {{closed his eyes}} and <b>nodded</b> heavily <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The Generals are {{assembled}} in consultation round the table, [...] WEIROTHER {{pointing to the}} map, LANGERON, BUXHOVDEN, and [...] MILORADOVICH standing by, DOKHTOROF bending over the map, [...] PRSCHEBISZEWSKY[13] indifferently walking up and down. KUTUZOF, [...] old and weary, with a scarred face and only one eye, is seated [...] in {{a chair at the}} head of the table, nodding, waking, and [...] <b>nodding</b> <b>again.</b> Some officers of lower grade are in the [...] background, and horses in waiting are heard hoofing and champing [...] outside.|$|R
6000|$|That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, <b>nodded</b> <b>again,</b> and said, with a patronizing laugh, [...] "It's {{more than}} that, Mum. Good again! Follow her up, Joseph!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{fisherman}} <b>nodded</b> <b>again.</b> His wondering {{eyes were}} still surveying his visitors, dwelling on every rent in their clothes or stain on their persons.|$|E
60|$|Clowes <b>nodded</b> <b>again.</b> He {{remembered the}} case well. Patterson had had {{gambling}} transactions with a Wrykyn tradesman, {{had been found}} out, and had gone.|$|E
6000|$|Reginald Carne <b>nodded,</b> and <b>again</b> a low mocking laugh {{came from}} his lips. [...] "You thought you were very clever, Volkes, mighty clever; but I tricked you." ...|$|R
6000|$|She <b>nodded,</b> and <b>again</b> {{her lips}} parted in the pitiful brave smile {{as she said}} whimsically: [...] "Oh, Dick, go call the neighbors in and show them what little Paula's din.|$|R
30|$|Some minutes later, MI {{was asked}} if she liked the communicator. She nodded her head affirmatively. MI {{was asked if}} {{she would like to}} use it <b>again,</b> and she <b>nodded</b> affirmatively <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{merchant}} <b>nodded</b> <b>again,</b> {{and lifting}} his cup drank Alef's health, following {{it up by}} a coarse joke in Cornish, which raised a laugh all round.|$|E
60|$|She <b>nodded</b> <b>again,</b> {{but he did}} {{not seem}} to resent her silence. He talked about the {{hardship}} of patrolling in winter, until the sergeant came back.|$|E
60|$|Deringham only <b>nodded</b> <b>again,</b> {{because this}} type of man was new to him, and {{he had learned to}} keep silent when in doubt; but Alton's big right hand closed into a fist.|$|E
60|$|He <b>nodded</b> {{his head}} <b>again,</b> evincing even greater {{satisfaction}} than before.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He knowed I did, so I only nodded, and he <b>nodded</b> back <b>again.</b> '"Anybody but me 'ud {{call you}} a fool, Sim," [...] he says. [...] "Lie down. Here comes the Pope's Blessing!" ...|$|R
60|$|Little Dorrit <b>again</b> <b>nodded</b> 'Yes,' {{with a more}} cheerful face than heart.|$|R
60|$|Thyme <b>nodded.</b> <b>Again</b> {{there was}} silence; {{but in these}} pauses there was no embarrassment, no {{consciousness}} apparently that it was silence, and their eyes--those young, impatient, interested eyes--were for ever busy observing.|$|E
60|$|The Duke {{stood with}} knitted brows. He {{seemed on the}} point of asking me some other question, but {{apparently}} he abandoned the idea. He <b>nodded</b> <b>again</b> and rang the bell. I was dismissed.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>nodded</b> <b>again,</b> touched {{himself and}} said [...] "Roger," [...] and then touched her. She now {{saw what he}} meant. It was his own name he had spoken, and he now asked for hers.|$|E
60|$|Shelton {{wondered}} what these ideals had been, {{but had no}} answer ready; so he <b>nodded,</b> and <b>again</b> held out his cigarettes, for, like a true Southerner, the little man had thrown the first away, half smoked.|$|R
5000|$|Jake Rohn from BET wrote: [...] "Lecrae <b>nods</b> <b>again</b> to Lamar (and the {{shifting}} {{consciousness of the}} mainstream) on the K.E. on the Track-produced, 'I'm Turnt,' satirically flipping a club-friendly sound to create an anti-Molly anthem." [...] In its review of the whole mixtape, HipHopDX wrote: [...] "At worst, songs like 'I’m Turnt' come off just as stylistically unimaginative as anything on the radio or BET. But they’ll earn points for offering substance—even if it occasionally appears {{in the form of}} clichés, such as talk of 'being high on the spirit, bro.' [...] " [...] In October 2013, Lecrae performed the song BET's 106 & Park.|$|R
60|$|I <b>nodded</b> my head <b>again.</b> It was all I {{could do}} to keep myself {{standing}} upright.|$|R
