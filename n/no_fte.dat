5000|$|Longitudinal {{performance}} implies navigation {{against a}} position along a track (e.g. 4-D control). However, {{at the present}} time, there are no navigation specifications requiring 4-D control, and there is <b>no</b> <b>FTE</b> in the longitudinal dimension. The current navigation specifications define requirements for along-track accuracy, which includes NSE and PDE. PDE is considered negligible. The along-track accuracy affects position reporting (e.g. [...] "10 NM to ABC") and procedure design (e.g. minimum segment altitudes where the aircraft can begin descent once crossing a fix).|$|E

50|$|As a Queensland unit, 11th Engineer Regiment traces {{its history}} back to 19th century Queensland based {{volunteer}} engineer units. In 1879, an engineer unit {{was formed in}} Brisbane. In response to international tensions with Russia in 1885, further engineer capability {{was developed by the}} Queensland Defence Force (QDF) and focused on supporting garrison defences with submarine mining. By 1900, a submarine mining drill shed was built at Alice Street, Brisbane. In 1903, the Queensland Garrison consisted of No. 5 Field Company, Electric Section and No. 3 Submarine Mining Company. In 1912, after the 1910 Kitchener Review, No 3 Electric Company Royal Australian Engineers and <b>No</b> 5 <b>FTE</b> Royal Australian Engineers, both Brisbane units, were disbanded.|$|R
40|$|Background We used workers' {{compensation}} data {{to identify}} {{health care workers}} at risk of tuberculosis exposure {{in the hospital and}} nonhospital environment. Methods We identified State Fund workers' compensation claims having a documented tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion (size = 10 mm) with a previous negative skin test between 1996 and 2000 in the State of Washington. Results Health care workers experienced an overall accepted workers' compensation claim rate of 2. 3 claims/ 10, 000 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) per year for tuberculin reactivity. Receptionists accounted for the largest number, with 18. 4 % tuberculin reactivity claims. The number of tuberculin reactivity claims was the highest for offices and clinics of doctors of medicine (3. 7 per 10, 000 FTEs), followed by medical laboratories (2. 6 per 10, 000 <b>FTEs).</b> <b>No</b> Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} plasma flow perturbations in {{the outer}} magnetosphere during the passage of magnetopause boundary waves and cylindrically shaped flux transfer events (FTEs). Spacecraft which remain within the magnetosphere observe bipolar flows normal to the nominal magnetopause accompanied by flows nearly opposite to the direction of boundary wave and/or FTE motion. Flows are generally discontinuous across FTE and magnetopause boundaries, with reversals in the component of flow tangential to the nominal magnetopause expected during all magnetopause crossings and some entries into <b>FTEs.</b> <b>No</b> bipolar flows normal to the nominal magnetopause occur within FTEs unless they rotate and none occur in the magnetosheath unless the boundary waves propagate relative to the magnetosheath flow. IRM satellite observations on October 28, 1984 may be interpreted either in terms of FTEs or boundary waves...|$|R
30|$|Our {{literature}} review above reveals {{that there is}} no approach that meets the requirements for our problem formulated in Sect.  1. In general, the integration of decisions on location and capacity planning, supplier and market selection as well as operations within supply chain networks is a well-researched area. However, with respect to discrete capacity planning modeled by capacity levels in literature, existing approaches do not consider the (monetary) investment or disinvestment consequences that arise from the change of capacity levels in subsequent time periods. Neither the aforementioned inter-temporal relationships between capacity levels nor their combination to alternatively selectable sequences (hereinafter referred to as alternatively selectable capacity profiles) have been analyzed so far. Several papers emphasize the need for an additional financial coordination. Approaches based on budgeting are unsuitable, as far as they do not allow for cash flow balancing between the time periods of the planning horizon. A few approaches implement the usage of instruments that allow for fixed rate debt financing during the limited engagement of an investor, but they neglect the impact of the company’s overall debt capacity on interest payments. Furthermore, the aforementioned approaches do not provide objectives that are suitable for the maximization of the annual payouts to the investor. On the one hand, this applies to approaches neglecting the time value of money. On the other hand, this applies to the overwhelming majority of approaches based on discounting rates representing the company’s overall cost of capital (such as WACC), i.e., a mixture of returns needed to compensate shareholders and creditors. Contrary to these entity approaches, the cash flows resulting from debt financing (interest payments including the resulting effects of the tax shield, changes in the overall debt) {{should be part of the}} cash flow calculation. Consequently, debt financing increases the value of firm, as interest payments to creditors reduce the taxable cash inflows from SC operations, and thus, the tax payments. The latter is considered within the flow-to-equity approach (Damodaran 2012). However, besides data-driven FTE approaches (e.g., Gardner et al. 2012, who are valuing a beverage company by analyzing the statement of cash flows and the income statement without any optimization), there is <b>no</b> model-driven <b>FTE</b> approach in the literature that allows for the coordination with supply chain planning so as to determine maximal payouts to the investor, to the best of our knowledge.|$|R
