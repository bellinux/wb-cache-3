We investigated daily <b>needle</b> <b>applicator</b> displacement during multifractionated high-dose-rate intersti-tial brachytherapy (HDR-ISBT) for postoperative recurrent uterine cancer. Eight {{patients with}} postopera-tive recurrent uterine cancer received HDR-ISBT {{with or without}} external beam radiotherapy using our unique ambulatory technique. To analyze displacement, we obtained daily computed tomography (CT) images for 122 flexible needle applicators at 21, 45, 69, and 93 hours after implantation. Displacement {{was defined as the}} length between the center of gravity of titanium markers and the <b>needle</b> <b>applicator</b> tips along the daily CT axis. For cases in which displacement was not corrected, we also calculated the dose that covered 90 % of the clinical target volume (D 90 (CTV)) using a dose–volume histogram (DVH). Median caudal <b>needle</b> <b>applicator</b> displacement at 21, 45, 69, and 93 hours was 3, 2, 4, and 5 mm, respec-tively. More than 15 mm displacement was observed for 2 % (2 of 122) and 17 % (10 of 60) of needle applicators at 21 and 93 hours, respectively. Cases in which dwell positions were not changed to correct the treatment plan, 2 of 8 patients showed more than 10 % reduction in D 90 (CTV) values compared with the initial treatment plan. Correction of dwell positions of the treatment source improves treatment DVH for multifractionated HDR-ISBT...|$|E
40|$|Local tumor {{progression}} (LTP) is {{a serious}} complication after local ablation of malignant liver tumors, negatively influencing patient survival. LTP {{may be the result}} of incomplete ablation of the treated tumor. In this study, we determined whether viable tumor cells attached to the <b>needle</b> <b>applicator</b> after ablation was associated with LTP and disease-free survival. In this prospective study, tissue was collected of 96 consecutive patients who underwent local liver ablations for 130 liver malignancies. Cells and tissue attached to the needle applicators were analyzed for viability using glucose- 6 -phosphate-dehydrogenase staining and autofluorescence intensity levels of H&E stained sections. Patients were followed-up until disease progression. Viable tumor cells were found on the needle applicators after local ablation in 26. 7 % of patients. The type of <b>needle</b> <b>applicator</b> used, an open approach, and the omission of track ablation were significantly correlated with viable tumor tissue adherent to the <b>needle</b> <b>applicator.</b> The presence of viable cells was an independent predictor of LTP. The attachment of viable cells to the needle applicators was associated with a shorter time to LTP. Viable tumor cells adherent to the needle applicators were found after ablation of 26. 7 % of patients. An independent risk factor for viable cells adherent to the needle applicators is the omission of track ablation. We recommend using only RFA devices that have track ablation functionality.

40|$|Aim: Local {{recurrence}} and {{needle track}} seeding are serious complications after local ablation for liver malignancies and potentially affect long-term survival. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the incidence of viable tissue adherent to the <b>needle</b> <b>applicators</b> after ablation to gain insight into the possible mechanisms of local recurrence and needle track seeding. Methods: A total of 40 consecutive patients underwent 59 local liver ablations. Cells and tissue attached to the <b>needle</b> <b>applicators</b> were analysed for morphology (HE, PAP and Giemsa staining) and viability (G 6 PD staining). Results: Macroscopic tissue adherence was visible following 31 of the ablative procedures, all with radiofrequency ablation. Four applications were performed percutaneously and 27 during an open procedure. Morphologically intact tumour cells could be identified in 8 patients (20 %), and viable tumour cells in 5 patients (12. 5 %). Morphologically intact tumour cells or viable tumour cells could only be demonstrated when track ablation was not performed. Conclusion: Viable tumour cells adherent to the <b>needle</b> <b>applicators</b> were found in an alarming 12. 5 % of patients after local ablation. We recommend track ablation not only after the procedure but also during any shifting and (re-) positioning to prevent shedding of viable tumour cells during or after ablation. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

30|$|One {{important}} issue with RFA {{is the problem}} of needle-track seeding, which was reported in one study at a rate of 12.5 % [69], although more recent studies show less alarming rates, ranging from 0.9 % to 4 % [70 – 72]. Needle biopsy before treatment, poor differentiation degree of the tumor, subcapsular lesions, patients treated in multiple sessions, and lesions requiring more than one electrode placement were identified as risk factors. Viable tumor cells adherent to the <b>needle</b> <b>applicators</b> were found in 12.5 % of patients after ablation without track ablation [73]. To prevent tumor seeding as well as to create hemostasis, ablation along the access track is recommended. Despite the risk of needle-track seeding, RFA is considered a curative treatment for small HCC lesions, and there is ongoing debate whether RFA could potentially be considered a first option for operable patients with very early stage HCC (BCLC stage 0) [74, 75]. In a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing percutaneous RFA to surgical resection in 180 patients with solitary HCCs < 5  cm in diameter, no differences in overall survival rates and cumulative recurrence-free survival rates were observed [76].|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Prenatal {{interventions}} {{may prevent}} some sequelae of congenital anomalies, yet open fetal surgery {{is limited by}} pre-term labor. We are developing amnioscopic strategies to reduce risks for in utero surgery. Methods: Seven fetal sheep were accessed percutaneously under ultrasound guidance, via maternal laparoscopy/transuterine trocars, or via laparoscopically assisted partial uterine exteriorization (mini-hysterotomy). Three fetal immobilization methods were investigated: 2 mm grasping forceps, 2 - 0 absorbable Roeder loop lasso, and detachable metal T-fasteners. Results: Percutaneous access with 2 mm trocars required accessible amniotic fluid pockets. The laparoscopically assisted method enabled 5 mm trocar placement under direct fetal visualization. Mini-hysterotomy avoided trocars and was leak-proof. 2 mm graspers enabled fetal manipulation with repeatable applications. Roeder loop sutures were not readily repositioned, and required two 3 mm or larger trocars. T-fasteners were easily deployed into fetal skin via the self-contained <b>needle</b> <b>applicator</b> with minimal hemorrhage. Cutaneous marks were present immediately from the grasper and T-fastener, but not at postoperative day 10. The Roeder loop produced no observable effects. All devices demonstrated adequate intrauterine performance. Conclusions: Minimally invasive fetal surgery promises to lower maternal-fetal risks. All strategies permitted prolonged amnioscopy and fetal manipulation. The 2 mm grasper was easiest to use, producing no observable lasting trauma...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of an {{incident}} in which a radioactive brachytherapy treatment source was temporarily unable to be retracted, an analysis was performed on the <b>needle</b> <b>applicator</b> used during the treatment. In this report, the results of laboratory evaluations of the physical, mechanical, and metallurgical condition of the subject applicator and two additional applicators are presented. A kink formed in the subject applicator during the incident. The laboratory investigation focused on identifying characteristics which would increase the susceptibility of an applicator to form a kink when subjected to bending loads. The results obtained during this investigation could not conclusively identify the cause of the kink. The subject applicator exhibited no unique features which would have made it particularly susceptible to forming a kink. The three applicators examined represent two methods of manufacturing. A number of characteristics inherent to the method used to manufacture the subject applicator which could lead to an increased susceptibility to the formation of a kink were observed. The use of an insertion device, such as the biopsy needle used during this incident, could also dramatically increase the likelihood of the formation of a kink if the applicator is subjected to bending loads. 33 figs., 4 tabs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Photosensitive {{cylinders}} {{are used}} in printing arts and more particularly in electrophotographic printing (xerographic copy). The photosensitive coating {{is applied to the}} cylinder in liquid form, before it is solidified. The liquid is applied to the cylinder through a <b>needle</b> <b>applicator</b> that translates along the direction of the cylinder axis. The cylinder rotates during this process in order to cover the entire surface. Therefore, the liquid is applied in a spiral pattern. To help spread liquid over the cylinder surface and improve the thickness uniformity, each liquid stream applied from the needle passes under a flexible blade. This process leads to a coating that presents a spiral pattern on the deposited layer thickness, which can cause defects on the electrophotographic process. The complete understanding of the flow is vital to the optimization of the process. A theoretical model of the thin film flow over the surface of a rotating cylinder is presented here. It is based on the lubrication approximation considering a thin precursor film in front of the apparent contact line. The resulting non-linear fourth-order PDE for the film thickness was solved by second-order finite difference method. The time discretization was done by using implicit Crank-Nicholson scheme. The non-linear algebraic equation at each time step was solved by Newton's method. The results show how the uniformity of the deposited layer varies with process parameters and liquid properties...|$|E

40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} the second leading cause of cancer related death in Europe. The overall {{survival}} rate of patients with colorectal cancer is greatly affected {{by the presence of}} liver metastases, which occurs in about 50 % of patients. Radical resection of colorectal liver metastases means a possibility of cure, resulting in a 5 year survival of 30 - 60 %. In case of irresectable metastases, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), using heat to destroy tumour tissue, is an alternative surgical treatment option. Survival rates vary widely after surgery and it can still not be predicted accurately which patient will experience a recurrence and which not. The identification of prognostic markers are needed to select patient that possibly benefit from surgery and/or additional therapies. This thesis describes factors associated with outcome of patients undergoing surgery for colorectal liver metastases. First we discuss factors associated with recurrence after RFA. We demonstrate that the presence of viable tumour cells attached to the RFA <b>needle</b> <b>applicators</b> is associated with an increased chance of local tumour progression. This problem might be overcome by ablating the needle track. Furthermore we show that tumours close to vessels can be ablated safe and effectively using a multipolar RFA device, where previous literature demonstrated a problem effectively ablating these tumours using a monopolar device. Second, factors associated with outcome after resection are examined. Preclinical research demonstrated that the protein CD 95 upon binding with its ligand activates pathways involved with a more agressive phenotype of colorectal liver metastases. Testing levels of CD 95 L in blood of patients demonstrated that higher levels of CD 95 L were associated with poor prognosis of patients with colorectal liver metastases. We used genomics and proteomics to identify more factors associated with poor prognosis of which the protein Maspin was a factor identified by both platforms. Next we used immunohistochemistry to determine Maspin expression in biopsies of primary colorectal cancer. We discovered a stage specific role for Maspin being prognostic in stage III but not in stage II primary colorectal cancer. Both Maspin and CD 95 L might be used in the future to select patients for surgery. Gene expression was further used to find a gene expression profile able to predict disease free survival. Unfortunately this attempt failed, possibly due to the phenomenon of ‘overfitting’. We did however discover that the profile was greatly influenced by administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy upregulates genes involved in the immune system. These genes seemed to have a tumour stimulating role, generating the question whether this genes might play a role in chemotherapy resistance. This thesis furthermore describes the Hepatica study, a randomized controlled study examining the addition of a angiogenesis inhibitor (bevacizumab) to a CAPOX regime. This study demonstrates the addition of bevacizumab is safe and leads to an improved non significant DFS. In conclusion, this thesis makes a start finding factors affecting outcome after surgery of colorectal liver metastases. Insight in the mechanisms involved with recurrence might select patients that will benefit from surgery and eventually lead to new therapeutic targets...|$|R
40|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} (RFA) is {{a procedure}} to treat {{tumors of the}} liver by passing current through a <b>needle</b> shaped <b>applicator</b> placed inside the tumor. The tissue gets heated up and tumor cells are destroyed. Careful planning of the applicator positioning is mandatory for a successful treatment. The desirability of a specific applicator positioning is measured by different criteria, rendering the RFA planning problem a multi-objective optimization problem. In our work we propose a deterministic vector optimization approach to solve the multi-objective RFA treatment planning problem. To allow for numerical optimization routines, feasibility must be expressed {{as a set of}} constraint functions. A difficult-to-treat aspect of feasibility is non-overlapping with critical structures such as organs and bones. We propose a modelling approach where the critical structures are approximated as a set of convex polytopes. Then it is a well-known fact that the non-overlapping condition is equivalent to the existence of a set of separating planes [...] each plane separating the applicator from one of the polytopes. In this way we can express the non-overlapping condition as a set of analytical constraint functions. A vector optimization approach strives to represent or approximate the set of efficient solutions. In this work we develop the adapted hyperboxing algorithm as a specific sandwiching method for the approximation of a non-convex non-dominated set. As in similar approaches, the non-dominated set is enclosed by a set of boxes, whose size is reduced systematically {{in the course of the}} algorithm. The adapted hyperboxing algorithm differs from previous methods in the construction of these boxes, which are spanned by the set of all feasible combinations of a so-called inner and an outer knee point. For the bi-criteria case we prove an a-priori upper bound for the approximation quality achieved by this algorithm. We show with several examples that the developed method can be successfully applied to calculate the non-dominated set of real-data RFA planning problems...|$|R
40|$|Eight, one-meter cubic soil monoliths were {{collected}} from research plots with 15 years of tillage and crop rotation history. Tillage practices, arranged in a randomized complete block with three replications, were chisel plow, moldboard plow, and ridge tillage. The plots {{were part of a}} soybean-corn crop rotation with corn planted the previous year. A test stand was developed that allowed water application using a hypodermic <b>needle</b> style <b>applicator,</b> and collection of leachate using a grid of fiberglass wick extractors. Three anion tracers were applied to simulate nitrogen application by surface broadcast, slot with surface compaction, and with water. Water applications of approximately 100 mm and 430 mm were applied immediately after tracer applications;Average nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N) leaching losses, following approximately 20 mm of drainage, were 19, 6, and 15 kg ha- 1, for the chisel plow, moldboard plow, and ridge tillage treatments, respectively. NO 3 -N concentrations peaked after 30 to 50 mm of rainfall at 130, 103, and 105 mg L- 1 for the chisel plow, moldboard plow and ridge tillage treatments, respectively. For all grid locations, CV values for NO 3 -N leaching losses were found to be greater than those calculated for drainage volumes;Leaching loss affected by nitrogen application method showed that within the slot treatment with surface compaction, {{more than twice as much}} NO 3 -N would be leached from the chisel plow, and 10 times more from moldboard plow treatments than from the ridge tillage treatment. NO 3 -N loss appeared to closely follow drainage water collection for each water application when the nitrogen was applied as a broadcast type of treatment while the slot with surface compaction treatment had a leaching pattern directly below the application zone. Results for the 530 mm of water application suggest that the greatest amount of NO 3 -N would be leached from the slot with surface compaction method-moldboard plow tillage combination. The least amount of NO 3 -N loss would be expected from the application with the water method and ridge tillage combination...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the safety of}} pulsed-dose-rate (PDR) brachytherapy by analyzing errors and technical failures during treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: More than 1, 300 patients underwent treatment with PDR brachytherapy, using five PDR remote afterloaders. Most patients were treated with consecutive pulse schemes, also outside regular office hours. Tumors were located in the breast, esophagus, prostate, bladder, gynecology, anus/rectum, orbit, head/neck, with a miscellaneous group of small numbers, such as the lip, nose, and bile duct. Errors and technical failures were analyzed for 1, 300 treatment sessions, for which nearly 20, 000 pulses were delivered. For each tumor localization, the number and type of occurring errors were determined, as were which localizations were more error prone than others. RESULTS: By routinely using the built-in dummy check source, only 0. 2 % of all pulses showed an error during the phase of the pulse when the active source was outside the afterloader. Localizations treated using flexible catheters had greater error frequencies than those treated with straight <b>needles</b> or rigid <b>applicators.</b> Disturbed pulse frequencies were {{in the range of}} 0. 6 % for the anus/rectum on a classic version 1 afterloader to 14. 9 % for orbital tumors using a version 2 afterloader. Exceeding the planned overall treatment time by > 10 % was observed in only 1 % of all treatments. Patients received their dose as originally planned in 98 % of all treatments. CONCLUSIONS: According to the experience in our institute with 1, 300 PDR treatments, we found that PDR is a safe brachytherapy treatment modality, both during and outside of office hour...|$|R
40|$|Primary liver tumors {{and liver}} metastases are of high {{clinical}} relevance. They are the fifth most common kind of malignant tumors {{and the third}} {{most common cause of}} death in the group of malignant tumors. Ultrasound controlled Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA) is accepted as a gentle and inexpensive treatment but suffers from higher recurrence of tumors compared to surgical resection. The main reasons are that only ultrasound images are available during the intervention and radiological data can not be mapped onto the patient. Therefore, exact positioning of the applicator and control of ablation are very difficult to perform. Thus, RFA as therapy usually is chosen only in cases where surgical resection is not possible. As a part of the BMBF project "FUSION" we are developing a 3 D ultrasound based navigation system and aim to improve the interventional process to achieve better outcome for patients who are treated with transcutane, ultrasound controlled RFA. The navigation system provides assistance by mapping radiological information (image sets as well as annotations) onto the patient. During an iterative process 3 D ultrasound data can be acquired and target positions as well as trajectories of applicator positions can be planned. Ultrasound probe and <b>applicator</b> <b>needle</b> are navigated continuously and independently. Intuitive navigation scenes enable the physician to gain more orientation and confidence during the different steps of applicator positioning. The incorporation of 3 D ultrasound fulfills different purposes: On the one hand, intrainterventional 3 D data can be used to improve the registration process, on the other hand they can support the pre- and postinterventional comparison of treated tumors...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{develop a}} method of {{delivering}} an eradicative high radiotherapeutic dose safely preserving the surrounding skin {{in the treatment of}} internal mammary lymph node metastasis (IMLNM) of breast cancer. METHODS: We report a 38 -year-old female patient with a solo IMLNM showing no response to 60 Gy in 2. 5 Gy fractions of external beam radiotherapy. To eradicate this tumor, a boost brachytherapy plan was created after percutaneous insertion of an <b>applicator</b> <b>needle</b> into the IMLNM lesion avoiding the pleura and vessels under ultrasound monitoring. According to the dose distribution, the required thickness of a spacer between the skin and the tumor was determined, and hyaluronic gel was injected up to this thickness under ultrasound monitoring. We evaluated skin doses, target doses and clinical outcome. RESULTS: All procedures were performed easily. Sixteen Gy (34. 7 Gy equivalent in 2 Gy fractions calculated by the linear quadratic model at &#x 3 B 1;/&#x 3 B 2; = 10 : EQD 2, &#x 3 B 1;/&#x 3 B 2; = 10, cumulative total was 101. 9 Gy EQD 10) to 100 % of the target volume was irradiated with cumulative maximum skin dose of 70 Gy EQD 2, &#x 3 B 1;/&#x 3 B 2; = 3 which was 98. 7 Gy EQD 2, &#x 3 B 1;/&#x 3 B 2; = 3 without spacer. No procedure related- or late complications and no local recurrence at the treated site were observed for three years until expiration. CONCLUSION: We consider that this procedure will provide an eradicative high-dose irradiation to IMLNM of breast cancer, preserving skin from overdose complications...|$|R
40|$|To achieve most {{effective}} cervical cancer breachytherapy treatment quality with image guided brachytherapy (IGBT), we propose a directional intensity modulate-available applicator. The direction modulate brachytherapy (DMBT) cervical cancer tandem applicator {{was designed to}} create non-isotropic dose distribution using tungsten alloy shielding in a tandem for an isotropic 192 -Ir HDR radiation source. Conventional tandem has 6 mm in outer diameter with 1 channel, however, the DMBT tandem has 6 channels, which is 1. 3 mm in diameter, on a surface of the tungsten alloy shield. Prototypes of the DMBT tandem was manufactured to prove of compatibilities with conventional clinical treatment systems such as MR image test, 192 -Ir afterloader source delivering test, and so on. The Monte Calro code was {{used to calculate the}} non-isotropic 192 -Ir dose distributions and in-house developed brachytherapy planning platform were used for plan re-optimizaiton. To evaluate a potential of the DMBT tandem, 3 different clinical treated patients group were re-optimized with DMBT tandem. The conventional tandem was replaced to the DMBT tandem for comparing differences while the ovoid or ring was kept in the same position. For comparing plan quality, HRCTV coverage was matched to each the clinical treated plans. The D 2 cc to OARs such as bladder, rectum, and sigmoid was recorded and compared. The first group was 75 clinical cases, which treated with the conventional tandem and ovoids (T&O) applicator. In the second group, a patient case with 5 brachytherapy fractions course was evaluated. From the 3 rd to 5 th fraction, supplementary free loaded needles were used. To evaluate the DMBT tandem potential of covering irregular HRCTV growth patters, the clinical plans were compared with DMBT and ovoid (without supplement needles) plans.

40|$|Purpose: To {{quantify}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) distortions on a plastic intracavitary/interstitial <b>applicator</b> with plastic <b>needles</b> at a field strength of 3 T and to determine the dosimetric impact, using patient data. Methods and Materials: For 11 cervical cancer patients, our clinical MRI protocol was extended with 3 scans. From the first scan, a multi-echo acquisition, {{a map of the}} magnetic field (B- 0) was calculated and used to quantify the field inhomogeneity. The expected displacements of the applicator were quantified for the clinical sequence using the measured field inhomogeneity and the clinical sequence's bandwidth. The second and third scan were our routine clinical sequence (duration: < 5 minutes each), acquired consecutively using opposing readout directions. The displacement of the applicator between these scans is approximately twice the displacement due to B 0 inhomogeneity. The impact of the displacement on the dose was determined by reconstructing the applicator on both scans. The applicator was then shifted and rotated the same distance as the observed displacement to create a worst-case scenario (ie, twice the actual displacement due to B 0 inhomogeneity). Next, the dose to 98 %/ 90 % (D 98 /D 90) of the clinical target volume at high risk, as well as the dose to the most irradiated 2 cm 3 for bladder and rectum, were calculated for the original plan as well as the shifted plan. Results: For a volume of interest containing the intrauterine device and the ovoids the 95 th percentile of the absolute displacement ranged between 0. 2 and 0. 75 mm, over all patients. For all patients, the difference in D 98 /D 90 in the opposing readout scans with the original plan was at most 4. 7 %/ 4. 3 %. For the dose to the most irradiated 2 cm 3 of bladder/rectum, the difference was at most 6. 0 %/ 6. 3 %. Conclusions: The dosimetric impact of distortions on this plastic <b>applicator</b> with plastic <b>needles</b> is limited. <b>Applicator</b> reconstruction for brachytherapy planning purposes is feasible at 3 T MRI.
