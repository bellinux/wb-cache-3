He claims that his experiences attending Wilson High School, whose student population was 70 percent black, inspired the song. There, many students bullied MacKaye and his friends. Thrash metal band Slayer later covered the song, with the last iteration of the lyric [...] "Guilty of being white" [...] changed to [...] "Guilty of being right." [...] In an interview, MacKaye stated that he was offended that some perceived racist overtones in the lyrics, saying, [...] "To me, {{at the time and}} <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> clear it's an anti-racist song. Of course, it didn't occur to me at the time I wrote it that anybody outside of my twenty or thirty friends who I was singing to would ever have to actually ponder the lyrics or even consider them." ...|$|E
60|$|Wait, though! Something surely WAS {{stirring}} on the desert--something {{her eyes}} had not observed at first. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> like a cloud; <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> like a spot of silver; <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to be a mass of rainbow colors that moved swiftly toward her.|$|E
60|$|He saw her <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to him, for {{the first}} time, and saw how he had misjudged her.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Meskhetian is still {{unexplored}} and highly controversial. But <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to emerge two main directions: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Read to me, Henry, dear. Read me {{something}} <b>now.</b> <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> ages and ages since you used to. Read {{me something}} out of the Encyclopaedia!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As, had it {{not been}} for you, Lady, surely I should have done--I and another. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that all three of us will live." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to Mr Apjohn certain that, had the old {{man made}} such a change in his purpose, he would have {{informed}} his nephew of the fact.|$|E
60|$|It {{was only}} with {{difficulty}} I restrained myself from crying aloud with joy, for <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed,</b> even surrounded by enemies though we were, that because my comrade had come were we rescued.|$|E
60|$|Joe had {{tossed her}} in the air, fondled her in his arms, paced to and fro as if walking for a wager, but all without avail, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> {{necessary}} he should have assistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yesterday you {{surprised}} me by making war upon the friendly Dutch. But <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> {{that not even}} your own countrymen are safe from you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We always said, Dan and I,' Una stammered, 'that {{if it ever}} {{happened}} we'd know ex-actly what to do; but--but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> all different somehow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Many excuses! But <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> a mere bestiality. I was so ignorant {{about the}} other matter that doubtless I am also quite deluded in this." ...|$|R
60|$|But I knew it all before--this law {{of nature}} and of necessity, against which all revolt is idle: often had the remembrance of it filled me with ineffable melancholy; only <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> cruel beyond all cruelty.|$|E
60|$|The {{automobile}} {{was of a}} cheap variety, and clattered noisily on its way, {{with one}} cylinder occasionally missing fire. It had been running in a snakelike course, but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to be making something of a circle.|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to him as}} if he {{must carry}} out the {{proposed}} crime, or set himself down as a coward, and because of being deficient in bravery his one fear was lest such fact should be generally known.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not necessarily," [...] {{said the}} Scarecrow. [...] "he may, have had corns. <b>Now,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me his eating beans {{with a knife}} is more suspicious." ...|$|R
30|$|No, {{not really}} because I {{had never really}} {{associated}} it with health, itâ€™s just you {{and the way you}} develop and your genes but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>it</b> does have an effect on your health, you know the way you live your life (Rebecca, 1 st interview).|$|R
6000|$|... "Our years keep taking toll as {{they move}} on; [...] My feasts, my frolics, are already gone, [...] And <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems,</b> my verses must go too." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{second time}} it came, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to break the}} hideous spell that its first {{utterance}} had cast over me. Dropping the leather bottle, I sped back, down the stone passage to the door that abutted on the chancel.|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> as {{if those}} five years were just one long dream--the soldiering, the voyage across the sea, {{the two years}} in a strange, strange land, all {{culminating}} in that awful cataclysm which had for ever robbed him of happiness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said Tripp, almost inaudibly. [...] "I'm sorry you're {{out your}} money. <b>Now,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to me like}} a find of a big story, you know-- that is, a sort of thing that would write up pretty well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{wants to}} marry you. <b>Now,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me that seven weeks is very short {{acquaintance}} for a decision like that. Are {{you sure you want}} him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Such led to thee O soul, [...] All senses, {{shows and}} objects, lead to thee, [...] But <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me sound leads o'er all the rest.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> one of {{the most}} {{developed}} municipalities of Nicaragua, but this development is based on unsustainable agricultural activities and not suitable for the tropical wet forest vocation.|$|R
60|$|Agatha {{could imagine}} it, {{and a certain}} indignation against Gregory crept into her heart. She had once liked {{to think of him}} as pitiful and chivalrous, and <b>now,</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed,</b> he was quite willing that this woman should make her {{sacrifice}} in vain.|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> {{the day was}} waning; deep shadows lay in the valleys, {{and night}} already enveloped the forest. Through rents in the broken clouds a few pale stars twinkled fitfully. Soon dark cloud {{curtains}} scurried across these spaces shutting out the light.|$|E
60|$|Cynthia turned away, {{her lips}} pressed together: How {{to deal with}} such a man! Wondrous notes broke on the stillness, the thrush was singing his hymn again, only <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> a paean. High in the azure a hawk wheeled, and floated.|$|E
6000|$|V. While I {{was awake}} I {{knew what you}} meant by [...] "spirit," [...] but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> only a word--such for {{instance}} as truth, beauty--a quality, I mean.|$|R
6000|$|Did {{we think}} victory great? So <b>it</b> is--But <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me, when it cannot be helped, that defeat is [...] great, And that death and dismay are great.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dashed if I know!' said Mr Boffin. 'It {{seemed at}} first {{as if it}} was only Lightwood that he objected to meet. And <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to be everybody, except you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Until {{that moment}} I had not {{questioned}} whether {{we might be}} allowed to enter the town; but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> certain that whoever accosted us could read our purpose on our faces and mentally nerved myself either for disappointment or for disaster.|$|E
60|$|He {{wished he}} had locked the door. The {{servants}} might hear and wonder {{what it was all}} about. Always he had feared love for the cruel thing it was, but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{him for the first time}} that he realized its monstrous cruelty.|$|E
60|$|Never had {{a hundred}} seconds {{appeared}} {{so long to}} Harry as <b>now.</b> <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> that the diver {{had been out of}} sight fully five minutes, and he was beginning to fear some accident had happened, when Joe reappeared, gasping for breath but looking very happy.|$|E
