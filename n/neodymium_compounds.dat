50|$|<b>Neodymium</b> <b>compounds</b> {{were first}} commercially used as glass dyes in 1927, and they remain a popular {{additive}} in glasses. The color of neodymium compounds—due to the Nd3+ ion—is often a reddish-purple but it changes {{with the type}} of lighting, due to the interaction of the sharp light absorption bands of neodymium with ambient light enriched with the sharp visible emission bands of mercury, trivalent europium or terbium. Some neodymium-doped glasses are also used in lasers that emit infrared with wavelengths between 1047 and 1062 nanometers. These have been used in extremely-high-power applications, such as experiments in inertial confinement fusion.|$|E
50|$|Neodymium is {{typically}} 10-18% of the rare-earth content of commercial deposits {{of the light}} rare-earth-element minerals bastnäsite and monazite. With <b>neodymium</b> <b>compounds</b> being the most strongly colored for the trivalent lanthanides, that percentage of neodymium can occasionally dominate the coloration of rare-earth minerals, when competing chromophores are absent. It usually gives a pink coloration. Outstanding examples of this include monazite crystals from the tin deposits in Llallagua, Bolivia; ancylite from Mont Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, Canada; or lanthanite from the Saucon Valley, Pennsylvania, United States. As with neodymium glasses, such minerals change their colors under the differing lighting conditions. The absorption bands of neodymium interact with the visible emission spectrum of mercury vapor, with the unfiltered shortwave UV light causing neodymium-containing minerals to reflect a distinctive green color. This can be observed with monazite-containing sands or bastnäsite-containing ore.|$|E

In this article a simple model is presented to approximately calculate this state using linearized augmented plane wave based on density functional theory.

This model is later applied to (YxCa 1 -x) CuO 2 and (NdxCa 1 -x) CuO 2.

40|$|This work {{shows an}} {{unconventional}} route for spin-driven ferroelectricity originating from a metastable magnetic field-induced canting of chromium sublattice {{in the presence}} of gadolinium moments in GdCrTiO 5 at low temperatures. Compared to the isostructural <b>neodymium</b> <b>compound,</b> significant differences of magnetism and magnetoelectric effects are seen. We present the results of thorough investigations of temperature and magnetic field dependent magnetization as well as ac and dc magnetic susceptibility. These bulk measurements are complemented by local-probe spectroscopy utilizing electron-spin resonance and muon-spin rotation/relaxation for probing the chromium moments. Ferroelectric order is inferred from pyro- and magnetocurrent measurements. GdCrTiO 5 shows a pyrocurrent signal around 10 K, only if the system is cooled in an applied magnetic field exceeding 10 kOe. A distinct spin-driven ferroelectric order is revealed in this state for temperatures below 10 K, which can be switched by changing magnetic-field direction and the polarity of the electric field. But, the magnetic measurements reveal no clear signature of long-range magnetic ordering. The presence of such meta-magnetoelectric-type behaviour {{in the absence of any}} meta-magnetic behavior is rare in the literature. Our microscopic spectroscopy results indicate significant changes of the magnetic properties around 10 K. Probably there is an exchange frustration between Gd and Cr moments, which prevents long-range magnetic ordering at further high temperature. Below 10 K, weak magnetic ordering occurs by minimizing frustration due to lattice distortion, which helps in magnetodielectric coupling. However, the non-polar distortion attains appreciable values after application of magnetic fields above 10 kOe to break the spatial inversion symmetry, which creates ferroelectricity.

40|$|The lanthanide(III) cyanoacetate {{complexes}} of {{the formula}} {[Ln 2 (CNCH 2 COO) 6 (H 2 O) 4]· 2 H 2 O}n, where Ln = Eu (1), Gd (2), Nd (3), {{have been prepared}} and characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. Complexes 1 and 2 are isostructural and differ from the binding scheme of the <b>neodymium</b> <b>compound</b> 3, structurally described earlier. In all cases, the cyano group of the cyanoacetate ligand is not coordinated to the lanthanide cation. The carboxylic groups exhibit different binding modes: 2 -bidentate-chelating, 2 -bidentate and 2 -tridentate-chelating bridging for 1 and 2, and 4 -bidentate and 2 -tridentate-chelating bridging for the complex 3. The Eu compound 1 shows field induced paramagnetism, as expected for a non-magnetic ground state with mixing from higher states. Combining the dc magnetization and luminescence measurements the spin-orbit coupling constant λ = 343 ± 4 cm - 1 was found, averaged over the two different sites for Eu in the lattice. In the Gd complex 2, a crystal field splitting of D/kB = - 0. 11 ± 0. 01 K has been found for the S = 7 / 2 multiplet of the Gd(III) ion. No slow relaxation at H = 0 is observed because the low anisotropy barrier allows fast spin reversal through classical processes. The application of an external magnetic field induces two slow relaxation processes. It is argued that the first relaxation rate {{is caused by the}} resonant phonon trapping (RPT) mechanism, while the second, slower relaxation rate is due to the lifting of the Kramers degeneracy on the ground state. For compound 3 heat capacity and dc susceptibility measurements indicate that at very low temperatures the ground state Kramers doublet has strong single ion anisotropy. The energy to the next excited doublet ΔZFS/kB = 104 K has been calculated by ab initio calculation methods. The g* tensor has also been calculated, showing that it has predominant anisotropy along the z-axis, and there is an important transversal component. At H = 0 quantum tunnelling is an effective mechanism in producing a fast relaxation to equilibrium at temperatures above 1. 8 K. The dipolar or exchange interactions and a sizable transverse anisotropy component in the ground state enhance the quantum tunneling probability. Under an external applied field, two slow relaxation processes appear: above 3 K the first relaxation mechanism is of the Orbach type, with an activation energy U/kB = 27 K; the slower relaxation is caused by the direct relaxation process from the ground state to the Kramers split levels by the applied field. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{impression}} that the measured B(H) curves of permanent-magnet materials indicate the temperature and the operating point at which flux losses start to occur. As long as the operating point stays above the knee of the B(H) curve, no losses will be ex-pected. The demagnetization process is, however, a time-dependent process and losses occurring immediately are followed by a thermal aftereffect. Here, we report our study of the time dependence of flux losses in commercial permanent Nd-Fe-B magnets. We present flux losses {{as a function of}} temperature for different exposure times. We then compare the measured B(H) curves of the Nd-Fe-B material to the results of loss measurements. We found that B(H) curves will not always indicate the overall losses well. The measured B(H) curve represents the demagnetization state of the tested magnet more or less after only 10 ms of exposure to the elevated temperature. When the operating point of the magnet is approaching the B(H) curve knee, the time-dependent losses will become significant. To control the time-dependent losses in sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets, the operating point needs to be sufficiently far away from the knee of the B(H) curve.

Chapter 3 : Rare-Earth Metal Carboxylates: Ln 2 (µ 3 -OH) (C 4 H 4 O 5) 2 (C 4 H 2 O 4) ]. 2 H 2 O [Ln=Ce, Pr and Nd] This chapter describes synthesis, structure and properties of series of rare-earth based compounds, [Ln 2 (µ 3 -OH) (C 4 H 4 O 5) 2 (C 4 H 2 O 4) ]. 2 H 2 O (Ln = Ce, Pr and Nd). The malic acid and fumaric acid form part of the structure. The lanthanide centers are connected by the malate units to form a two dimensional layers, which are pillared by fumarate units forming the three-dimensional structure. Overall, structure can be described as I 2 O 1 type inorganic in two-dimension (Ln-O-Ln layers) and organic in one dimension. The extra framework water molecules form a dimer and occupy the channels. The robustness of the framework was reflected in terms of facile removal and reinsertion of the water molecules, which is also confirmed by single crystal XRD, variable temperature IR and cyclic TGA study. The presence of water dimers and weakly interacting water chain suggested the possibility of proton migration in these compounds. Proton conductivity studies reveal the conductivity values of ~ 2. 85 x 10 - 6 Ω- 1 cm- 1 at 98 % relative humidity. The optical studies revealed an up-conversion behavior involving more than one photon for the <b>neodymium</b> <b>compound.</b> Chapter 4 : Bismuth Carboxylates with Brucite and Fluorite Related Structures The synthesis, structure and properties of three new bismuth based coordination polymers have been described in this chapter. The compounds [C 4 N 2 H 10][Bi(C 7 H 4 NO 4) (C 7 H 3 NO 4) ]. H 2 O (I), [Bi(C 5 H 3 N 2 O 4) (C 5 H 2 N 2 O 4) ] (II) and [Bi(µ 2 -OH) (C 7 H 3 NO 4) ] (III) were isolated employing hydrothermal condition with three different heterocyclicdicarboxylic acids, 3, 6 -pyridinedicarboxylic acid, 4, 5 -imidazoledicarboxylic acid and 3, 4 -pyridinedicarboxylic acid respectively. The structures of all the compounds have linkages between Bi 2 O 2 and the corresponding dicarboxylate forming a simple molecular unit in I, a bilayer arrangement in II and a three-dimensional extended structure in III. The topological arrangement of the nodal building units in the structures resembles brucite related layers in II and fluorite related arrangement in compound III. By utilizing the secondary interactions, the structure of III can be correlated to a Kagome related net. The observation of such classical inorganic related structures in the bismuth carboxylates is noteworthy. Heterogeneous catalytic studies indicate Lewis acidic nature in the bismuth center in all three compounds. Chapter 5 : Solvent dependent Delamination, Restacking and Ferroelectric studies in a Two-Dimensional Compound [NH 4][Ag 3 (C 9 H 5 NO 4 S) 2 (C 13 H 14 N 2) 2]. 8 H 2 O This chapter describes synthesis, structure, water dependent delamination/restacking and ferroelectric behavior in a layered coordination polymer compound, [NH 4][Ag 3 (C 9 H 5 NO 4 S) 2 (C 13 H 14 N 2) 2]. 8 H 2 O. The compound has a two-dimensional structure with the water molecules occupying the inter-lamellar spaces. The lattice water molecules can be fully removed and reinserted, which accompany the crystalline-amorphous-crystalline transformation. This transformation resembles the collapse/delamination and re-stacking of the layers. This transformation has also been investigated by in-situ IR and PXRD studies. The presence of a natural dipole (anionic framework and cationic ammonium ions) along with the non-centrosymmetric space group gives rise to a room-temperature ferroelectric behavior to the compound with saturation polarization (Ps) of 1. 95 μC/cm 2 and remnant polarization of 0. 63 μC/cm 2. The temperature dependent dielectric measurements indicate that the ferroelectric-paraelectric transformation occurs at 320 K. The ferroelectric-paraelectric transformation also follows the crystalline-amorphous-crystalline transitions...|$|R
