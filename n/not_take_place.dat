5|$|Shortly after {{becoming}} ruler of Deheubarth, Rhys heard rumours that Owain Gwynedd {{was planning to}} invade Ceredigion in order to reclaim it for Gwynedd. Rhys responded by building a castle at Aberdyfi in 1156. The threatened invasion did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place,</b> and Turvey claims that Owain's intention may have been to test the resolve of the new ruler.|$|E

5|$|A {{moderate}} risk {{of severe}} storms was {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center for February28 across parts of the central Plains. The first tornadoes developed {{early in the evening}} of February28 in Kansas as the dry line pushed eastward and was lifted by the cold front. In total, 12 tornadoes formed that evening across Kansas and Missouri, of which 11 were weak. However, one of the tornadoes was an EF4, the first such tornado recorded and the first violent tornado since September22, 2006. No one was injured that evening. Farther south, expected activity in Oklahoma and Arkansas did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> as the atmospheric cap held up.|$|E
5|$|Although France were {{represented}} at the 1900 Summer Olympics, their first official test match did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> till New Year's Day, 1906 against the New Zealand All Blacks in Paris. France then played intermittently against the Home Nations until they joined them {{to form the}} Five Nations tournament in 1910. In 1913 France faced South Africa's Springboks for the first time; losing 38–5. France also competed at the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics, and on both occasions lost to the United States in the gold medal match, Vicky LeDonne scored the winning goal.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal claimed {{their fourth}} Emirates Cup in 2015; the {{competition}} was held on the final weekend of July. The hosts scored seven goals in the tournament – six against Olympique Lyonnais, who later became the first team in the competition's history not to score a goal in either of their matches. Due to the extended schedule of UEFA Euro 2016 and essential pitch reconstruction works at the Emirates Stadium, the Emirates Cup did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> in the pre-season period of the 2016–17 season.|$|E

5|$|Compounding {{the loss}} of men to {{reinforce}} 21st Army Group, on 3 July the 115th Infantry Brigade was withdrawn from the division. The brigade was earmarked for an operation to liberate the Channel Islands and was re-designated Force 135. Ultimately such an operation did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> and the brigade was deployed to mainland Europe. During August, the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division began to disperse. On 15 August, the divisional headquarters ceased commanding any subordinate units {{and by the end}} of the month the division was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} were {{to exceed the}} Chandrasekhar limit, and nuclear {{reactions}} did <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place,</b> the pressure exerted by electrons {{would no longer be}} able to balance the force of gravity, and it would collapse into a denser object called a neutron star. Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting mass from a neighboring star undergo a runaway nuclear fusion reaction, which leads to a Type Ia supernova explosion in which the white dwarf may be destroyed, before it reaches the limiting mass.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> due to the frozen ground.|$|E

LCR shareholders rejected the proposal, and the government, which effectively could overrule shareholders' decisions as a result of LCR's reclassification as a state-owned body, decided that discussions with shareholders would <b>not</b> <b>take</b> <b>place</b> imminently, effectively backing shareholders' views on the proposed takeover.|$|E
5|$|Jarre {{performed}} 10 concerts (Oxygène Live) in Paris, from 12–26 December 2007, {{held in the}} Théâtre Marigny, a small 1000-seat theatre in the Champs-Élysées.

5|$|One {{consequence}} of the reassessment of sources is the reappearance of Troilus in his ancient form of andropais. Troilus takes this form in Giraudoux's The Trojan War Will <b>Not</b> <b>Take</b> <b>Place,</b> his first successful reappearance in the 20th century. Troilus is a fifteen-year-old boy whom Helen has noticed following her around. After turning down the opportunity to kiss her when she offers and when confronted by Paris, he eventually accepts the kiss {{at the end of}} the play just as Troy has committed to war. He is thus a symbol of the whole city's fatal fascination with Helen.|$|E

5|$|The Civil Partnership Act {{came into}} effect on 1 January 2011.

However, the legislation does provide a mechanism for exemptions to be sought through the courts, and the first partnership, which was between two men, was registered on 7 February 2011. While this ceremony was carried out publicly in the Civil Registration Office in Dublin, the mainstream media were not present.|$|E
