5|$|The Turkish janissaries {{military}} corps {{had included}} since the 14th century bands called mehter or mehterân which, {{like many other}} earlier military bands in Asia featured {{a high proportion of}} drums, cymbals, and gongs, along with trumpets and shawms. The high level of <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> pertinent to their function of playing on the battlefield to inspire the soldiers. The focus in these bands was on percussion. A full mehterân could include several bass drums, multiple pairs of cymbals, small kettledrums, triangles, tambourines, and one or more Turkish crescents.|$|E
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E

5000|$|Timing <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> {{the name}} for {{rotational}} irregularities observed in all pulsars. This timing <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> observable as random wandering in the pulse frequency or phase. [...] It is unknown whether timing <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> related to pulsar glitches.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external static. In modern terminology, this would include random (thermal and shot) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by Schottky in 1918 on shot noise. To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing directional antennae and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.|$|E
5|$|External costs, also {{referred}} to as hidden costs, are quantifications of the environmental and climate impacts of air transport. Whilst setting a financial value on all such impacts is difficult to do precisely, figures have been produced for the most significant. In 2000 the government valued the annual cost of climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions from UK air transport at £1.4billion, rising to £4.8billion per annum by 2030. The impact of <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> costed at around £25million per annum in 2000, and for the same year the impact on air quality was costed at between £119million and £236million per annum. Based on figures produced by the European Environment Agency the AEF has calculated a much higher total external cost for 2000 of around £6billion.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} self-supporting, {{with its own}} engineer, signals, transport, and {{quartermaster}} sections. The signals section had a powerful but cumbersome Wireless Set No. 11 for communicating with the 7th Division. Powered by lead-acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators, it required multiple signallers to carry and the <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> liable {{to attract the attention}} of the enemy. The platoons were equipped with the new Army No. 208 Wireless Sets. These were small, portable sets developed for the communication needs of units on the move in jungle warfare. However, the 2/6th Independent Company had not had time to work with them operationally.|$|E

5|$|The soundtrack for Silent Hill was {{composed}} by sound director Akira Yamaoka, who requested {{to join the}} development staff after the original musician had left. In addition to the music, {{he was in charge}} of tasks such as sound effect creation and audio mastering. Yamaoka did not watch game scenes, but created the music independently from its visuals. The style of his compositions was influenced by Twin Peaks composer Angelo Badalamenti. To differentiate Silent Hill from other games as much as possible, and to give it a cold and rusty feel, Yamaoka opted for industrial music. When he presented his musical pieces to the other staff members for the first time, they misinterpreted their sound as a game bug. Yamaoka had to explain that this <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> intended for the music, and the team only withdrew their initial objection after he elaborated on his reasons for choosing this style.|$|E
25|$|The first Art of Noise album, Who's Afraid of the Art of <b>Noise?</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in 1984. During this period, the group presented themselves as faceless (using masks, minimal personal appearances, or even absence from promotion {{to indicate that}} the Art of <b>Noise</b> <b>was</b> not a standard rock or pop band which promoted and mythologised its members as individuals).|$|E
25|$|When Penzias and Wilson {{reduced their}} data {{they found a}} low, steady, mysterious noise that persisted in their receiver. This {{residual}} <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> 100 times more intense than they had expected, was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. They were certain that the radiation they detected on a wavelength of 7.35 centimeters {{did not come from}} the Earth, the Sun, or our galaxy. After thoroughly checking their equipment, removing some pigeons nesting in the antenna and cleaning out the accumulated droppings, the noise remained. Both concluded that this <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> coming from outside our own galaxy—although they were not aware of any radio source that would account for it.|$|E
50|$|Electronic <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> {{defined as}} {{unwanted}} disturbances superposed on a useful signal {{that tend to}} obscure its information content. <b>Noise</b> <b>is</b> {{not the same as}} signal distortion caused by a circuit. <b>Noise</b> <b>is</b> associated with all electronic circuits. <b>Noise</b> may <b>be</b> electromagnetically or thermally generated, which can be decreased by lowering the operating temperature of the circuit. Other types of noise, such as shot <b>noise</b> cannot <b>be</b> removed as they are due to limitations in physical properties.|$|R
5000|$|Since equal-loudness curves depend {{not only}} on the {{individual}} but also on the volume at which the <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> played back, there is no one true grey noise. A mathematically simpler and clearly defined approximation of an equal-loudness <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> pink <b>noise</b> which creates an equal amount of energy per octave, not per hertz (i. e. a logarithmic instead of a linear behavior), so pink <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> closer to “equally loud at all frequencies” than white <b>noise</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R

50|$|Roland Barthes {{distinguishes between}} {{physiological}} <b>noise,</b> which <b>is</b> merely heard, and psychological <b>noise,</b> which <b>is</b> actively listened to.

25|$|Their second album, Queens of <b>Noise</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in 1977 {{and the band}} began a world tour. The Runaways quickly became lumped in with the growing punk rock movement. The band (already fixtures on the West Coast punk scene) formed alliances with mostly male punk bands such as the Ramones and the Dead Boys (via New York City's CBGB) {{as well as the}} British punk scene by hanging out with the likes of the Damned, Generation X and the Sex Pistols.|$|E
25|$|Dean, who {{had been}} {{suffering}} with a severe bout of the flu for several days, attended a post-caucus rally for his volunteers at the Val-Air Ballroom in West Des Moines, Iowa and delivered his concession speech, aimed at cheering up those in attendance. Dean was shouting over the cheers of his enthusiastic audience, but the crowd <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> being filtered out by his unidirectional microphone, leaving only his full-throated exhortations audible to the television viewers. To those at home, he seemed to raise his voice out of sheer emotion.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Our {{group has}} {{produced}} the system whereby <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> exchanged for thermal energy, and been able to extract {{the heat from the}} <b>noise.</b> <b>Noise</b> <b>is</b> usually absorbed by some substance and finally exchanged for thermal energy. Therefore this system has advantage that it never produces additional heat loads in a global environment. It is also very unique that energy of <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> actively consumed by the energy exchange. <b>Noise</b> <b>is</b> an unusual type of energy because waste of <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> encouraged. It <b>is</b> thought that <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> applied as an alternative energy. This system, however, has disadvantage that energy transformed is very little, because energy of <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> little. Therefore, the system which extracted the energy of noise from very wide area was proposed. It consisted of many thermoacoustic tubes. It is difficult to sum the thermal energy which was transformed by the many tubes if energy after exchanging is heat. The system whereby energy of <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> exchanged to electric energy has been produced, although we understand that the efficiency of exchange is reduced. Thermal energy which was transformed by thermoacoustic tubes was transformed into electric energy by Peltier devices again. Though electric energy which was transformed b...|$|R
25|$|At 15:08, , moored at Tare 8, exploded, {{sending a}} large {{fireball}} into the sky. The <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> heard miles away at Pearl Harbor Headquarters. More explosions of increasing intensity followed, sparking {{fears of a}} Japanese attack or even an earthquake. Fire and debris raining down on the fuel and munitions stored on the decks of other LSTs had caused an explosive chain reaction. Within minutes, 200 men had been blown into the water. Eleven wooden buildings on the shore were destroyed and vehicles blown on their side. In all, 20 buildings were damaged.|$|E
25|$|As Vijaya and Kuveni were sleeping, {{he woke up}} to {{sounds of}} music and singing. Kuveni {{informed}} him that the island was home to Yakkhas, who would kill her for giving shelter to Vijaya's men. She explained that the <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> because of wedding festivities in the Yakkha city of Sirisavatthu. With Kuveni's help, Vijaya defeated the Yakkhas. Vijaya and Kuveni had two children: Jivahatta and Disala. Vijaya established a kingdom, which was named Tambapanni ("copper-red hands"), because the men's hands were redenned by the red soil of the area. The {{members of the community}} established by Vijaya were called Sinhala after Sinhabahu.|$|E
25|$|A {{passenger}} airbag was offered {{as an option}} in the Series II facelift of October 1995. The unique design allowed it to protect the not only the front passenger, but the centre passenger as well (only the entry-level GLi was offered with the optional bench seat). The Fairmont Ghia was the only trim level to receive dual airbags as standard, which also benefited from the XR6 engine, leather upholstery, extensive use of chrome and lowered suspension. With the use of neoprene rubber insulation, road and wind <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> cut off from within the cabin, contributing to vehicle refinement. Ford also dropped the XR6 station wagon from the lineup in the Series II.|$|E
30|$|The second {{configuration}} injects {{white noise}} and cafeteria noise; again, the conditions {{with all the}} seven <b>noises</b> <b>are</b> tested. The results are presented in Figure 5 b. We observe a similar pattern {{as in the case}} of white + car noise (Figure 5 a): The performance on speech corrupted by any <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> significantly improved. The difference from Figure 5 a is that the performance on the speech corrupted by cafeteria <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> more effectively improved, while the performance on the speech corrupted by car <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> generally decreased. This is not surprising as the cafeteria <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> now ‘known’ and the car noise becomes ‘unknown’. Interestingly, the performance on speech corrupted by the restaurant noise and that by the station <b>noise</b> <b>are</b> both improved in a more effective way than in Figure 5 a. This suggests that the cafeteria noise shares some patterns with these two types of noises.|$|R
