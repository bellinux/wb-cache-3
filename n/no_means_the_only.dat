5|$|Whatever {{his sources}} may have been, the immense {{popularity}} of Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae cannot be denied. Well over 200 manuscript copies of Geoffrey's Latin work {{are known to}} have survived, and this does not include translations into other languages. Thus, for example, around 60 manuscripts are extant containing Welsh-language versions of the Historia, the earliest of which were created in the 13th century; the old notion that some of these Welsh versions actually underlie Geoffrey's Historia, advanced by antiquarians such as the 18th-century Lewis Morris, has long since been discounted in academic circles. As a result of this popularity, Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae was enormously influential on the later medieval development of the Arthurian legend. While it was by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> creative force behind Arthurian romance, many of its elements were borrowed and developed (e.g., Merlin and the final fate of Arthur), and it provided the historical framework into which the romancers' tales of magical and wonderful adventures were inserted.|$|E

This paper questions that common wisdom — summed up in Hirschman's perversity, futility and jeopardy theses. It conducts a comparative empirical investigation of the consequences of recent bans on 'extremist' parties in three self-styled European democracies — Turkey, Spain and Belgium. It finds that those consequences were not as dire as predicted. This suggests that banning such parties, while by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> always <b>the</b> <b>only</b> or <b>the</b> right thing to do, is not necessarily a mistake, at least on practical rather than normative grounds...|$|R

25|$|Chinese {{names are}} a well-studied example of surname extinction: there are {{currently}} only about 3,100 surnames in use in China, compared with close to 12,000 recorded in the past, with 22% of the population sharing the names Li, Wang and Zhang (numbering close to 300 million people), and the top 200 names covering 96% of the population. Names have changed or become extinct for various reasons such as people taking {{the names of their}} rulers, orthographic simplifications, taboos against using characters from an emperor's name, among others. While family name lines dying out may be a factor in the surname extinction, it is by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> or even a significant factor. Indeed, the most significant factor affecting the surname frequency is other ethnic groups identifying as Han and adopting Han names. Further, while new names have arisen for various reasons, this has been outweighed by old names disappearing.|$|E

50|$|In general, Japan has not {{imported}} {{an unusually}} large amount {{as a share of}} its GNP, but it has been highly dependent on imports for a variety of critical raw materials.

The country imported, for example, 50% of its caloric intake of food and about 30% of the total value of food consumed in the late 1980s. It also depended on imports for about 85% of its total energy needs (including all of its petroleum and 89% of its coal) and nearly all of its iron, copper, lead, and nickel.|$|R
40|$|At {{a time of}} {{continuing}} financial crisis in Asia, {{the question of the}} appropriate policies for recovery and for future sustainable development is paramount. One area of particular importance is the treatment of foreign investors. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has played a leading role in many of the economies of the region, particularly in export sectors, and has been a vital source of foreign capital during the crisis. The four countries reviewed in this study — Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand (referred to hereinafter as the ASEAN 4) — have all to varying degrees welcomed inward investment for its contribution to exports. As a result, although only a small share of total investment or employment in each economy, FDI has been a key factor driving export-led growth in Southeast Asia.

25|$|Persepolis was by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{large scale}} Achaemenid project, as Susa also hosted a similar {{structure}} initiated by Darius for similar ceremonial purposes. However, {{that history is}} able to enjoy the remains of Persepolis as opposed to meager remnants of Susa, owes partly to selection of stone in construction of Persepolis over mud-brick in Susa, {{and the fact that}} it had been relatively uninhabited, protecting it from wear and tear of inhabitants. Politically, Persepolis also was a significant find because nearby discovery of Naqsh-e Rustam, the Persian necropolis home to Darius the Great shed light on the significance it has had as one of the major capitals of the empire. Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son Xerxes the Great, Artaxerxes I, and Darius II as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion.|$|E
25|$|According to Gee, {{there are}} at least two reasons why we should {{consider}} literacy in broader terms than the traditional conception of literacy as the ability to read and write. First, in our world today, language is by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> communication system available. Many types of visual images and symbols have specific significances, and so “visual literacies” and literacies of other modes, or the concept of multimodal literacy, are also included in Gee’s conception of new literacies. Second, Gee proposes that reading and writing (the ‘meat’ of literacy according to the traditional notion of the term) are not such obvious ideas as they first appear. “After all,” he states, “we never just read or write; rather, we always read or write something in some way”. In other words, according to which type of text we read there are different ways in which we read depending on the “rules” of how to read such a text. Literacy to Gee, even if it is the traditional print-based literacy, should be conceived as being multiple, or comprising different literacies, since we need different types of literacies to read different kinds of texts in ways that meet our particular purposes in reading them.|$|E
25|$|While CEN 1789:2007 {{represents}} the current European {{standard for the}} design of ambulances, it is by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> example of such a standard. Standards for ambulance design have existed in the United States since 1976, where the standard is known as KKK-1822-A. This standard has been revised several times, and is currently in version 'F', known as KKK-1822-F. As with the European system, only the most current version of the standard should be used. One of the first known standards for ambulance design occurred in London, England, as the result of efforts by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, acting in response to the cholera outbreak of 1832. While horse-drawn, this provided the actual standard for many of the earliest civilian ambulances around the world. More contemporary versions of ambulance design standards also exist at a local level in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In each case, the country or jurisdiction develops such standards based upon its own needs, priorities, and realities, and this is also true of the European standard. In some cases, standards compliance may not be planned, and may occur as an incidental result of normal operations. To illustrate, a small country has no domestic ambulance manufacturers, but imports its vehicles from a larger country in which the manufacturer must comply with a published standard. In most cases, the ambulances imported by the smaller country will end up complying with the larger country's standard, {{regardless of whether or not}} this outcome was intended. American and Australian standards were reviewed and considered during the development of the European standard, but were not precisely followed because European needs and priorities were different.|$|E

In a next section the current Ukrainian conflict formation is introduced as a case to illustrate the usefulness of these concepts. Internal Ukrainian relations are taken into account with respect to nationalist sentiment as well as geopolitical practice as well as the contrary geopolitical visions of the major external actors involved. Some suggestions on the shifting significance of nationalism and geopolitics are finally made as a consequence of changed circumstances resulting from globalization and the concomitant weakening of the national state as the firm foundation of the political order...|$|R

This presentation is often featured in university and college recruitment events on campus and has been “performed” at K- 12 schools and community college events around the state. It has also been given at a distance {{with the help of the}} Engineering Distance Education staff.

These include issues that affect current trading patterns with Asia, and opportunities for enhanced future trade and strengthened economic relationships with China, Japan and other countries in the Asia-Pacific and Indo-Pacific regions. International trade has a role to play in strengthening industrial sectors within the WA economy – including, but also extending beyond, the mining and resources sectors. Trade is also a critical factor in supporting a diversification of the strengths in the WA economy. The report reminds us that as important as China is to the economic fortunes of the state, it is by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> <b>the</b> state’s <b>only</b> export destination. To focus solely on China would be myopic. There are new partnerships to forge, emerging industries to support, infrastructure bottlenecks to overcome and the WA ‘brand’ to promote. The report also examines the question of trade and economic development from the perspective of WA’s regions. It highlights important barriers that regional businesses and residents, together with policymakers, have overcome in their pursuit of efficiency gains and growth. It also seeks to explore what strategies the regions can adopt to further promote their own trade with country partners in the Asia-Pacific region, and develop new economic opportunities to tap into global export markets...|$|R
30|$|For each WZ block, {{a set of}} {{potential}} motion compensated predictors (SI) is formed from all the blocks extracted from a window centered around the co located block in the previous frame. For every candidate predictor, a WZ decoding is performed using the received parity bits of the original transformed coefficients. The associated CRC is computed on the resulting decoded block. If the CRC matches with that received from the encoder, then the WZ block is flagged as successfully decoded, and the process is repeated on the next WZ block. If instead the CRC does not match, another candidate predictor is considered, until all possible predictors have been tested. A decoding failure is declared when no candidate predictor lead to a successfull CRC. In this case, since no reliable predictor is available for the current block, a zero-motion concealment is performed on such block. Since the PRISM codec does not use any feedback channel, decoding failure is more frequent when the channel is error prone, which lead to a PSNR impairment, while the rate is unaltered {{with respect to the}} error-free case. In some sense it is possible to say that this decoding process performs a joint motion estimation and WZ decoding. It {{is important to note that}} the correctness of the estimated motion is by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> important, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> important result being a correct CRC (which presumably implies a correct reconstruction of the original DCT coefficients).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—For decades now, {{mainstream}} development environments {{provide the}} same basic automations for navigating source code: mainly searching and the tree exploration of files and folders. This may imply that other automations have little additional value or too steep a learning curve for mainstream adoption. This paper investigates whether existing navigation automations enriched with traceability benefit basic maintenance tasks such as changing features and fixing bugs in code. To test this, we conducted a controlled experiment with 52 subjects performing real maintenance tasks on two third-party development projects: all with the same navigation tool but half of the tasks with {{and the other half}} without traceability navigation. We found that the existence of traceability profoundly affected the quality of the change tasks and fundamentally changed how software engineers navigated through source code. We show that software engineers benefit instantly from traceability, without training, which is to show that the current automations available to software engineers are by <b>no</b> <b>means</b> sufficient or <b>the</b> <b>only</b> easy ones to use.

They have served him, and he thus repays them by this use of his patronage in their favor. At four hundred and thirty-four post-offices in the States-- those being the offices to which the highest salaries are attached-- the President has this power, and exercises it as a matter of course.
