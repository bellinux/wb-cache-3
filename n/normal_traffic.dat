Fusail {{was about}} half {{way to the}} Jisr ed Damieh bridge, and after waiting for the {{dismounted}} sections of Meldrum's Force to arrive, the consolidated force advanced to attack Jisr ed Damieh. The 2nd Battalion, British West Indies Regiment remained to garrison Kh. Fusail, occupying a position at Talat Armah to protect Meldrum's right flank and rear, and if necessary to block the track from Mafid Jozele. Aerial reconnaissance flights during the evening of 21 September, confirmed that Shunet Nimrin {{in the rear of}} Meldrum's Force was still strongly garrisoned, and that the roads and tracks running west from Amman were carrying <b>normal</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parades {{are held}} {{for a range}} of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are {{designed}} to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert <b>normal</b> <b>traffic,</b> parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. Cavalcades and the modern variant, the motorcade, are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in 5) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Wilco {{had planned}} on {{releasing}} Yankee Hotel Foxtrot on September 11, 2001, but Tweedy {{did not want}} a change in record labels to significantly delay {{the release of the}} album. Within weeks of being released from the label and Jay Bennett leaving the band, MP3s of all tracks from the album began to appear on file sharing networks. In a decision aimed at discouraging the downloading of lower quality unlicensed MP3s and having some control over how the album was distributed, on September 18, 2001, Wilco began streaming the entirety of the album on their official website. The wilcoworld.net website registered over 50,000 hits that day, eight times as much as typical daily traffic. Traffic to the website quadrupled the <b>normal</b> <b>traffic</b> over the next few months. The following tour was a success financially, and members of Wilco observed that fans sang along with unreleased songs from the album.|$|E

5|$|I-296 {{begins at}} the I-196 {{interchange}} west of the Grand River and downtown Grand Rapids.

This anomaly is reversed north of the ramps for I-196 as the southbound lanes go over the northbound lanes. Running parallel to the Grand River on the west bank, the freeway designation begins across the river from the 6th Street Bridge Park and Belknap Hill north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum and the DeVos Place Convention Center. The west side of the freeway faces residential neighborhoods and the east side borders commercial businesses and the river. South of the Ann Street interchange, the highway crosses a line of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad. After crossing both the railroad and Ann Street, the highway widens to allow for a grassy median. The freeway leaves Grand Rapids and enters Walker north of Ann Street.|$|E
5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} {{at the impact}} the cemetery scheme {{would have on the}} normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on <b>normal</b> <b>traffic</b> and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E

In September 1947, the corvette HMAS Warrnambool was badly damaged when it collided with a sea mine, killing three crewmen, and injuring 86 others. This highlighted the danger posed by the mines; by 1948, the official minesweeping flotilla disbanded, after having collected over 2000 mines and cleared the shipping lanes for <b>normal</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The spans {{have been}} a {{favorite}} of movie production crews as the CCC is an iconic part of the skyline of the city. The HOV lanes are frequently used for filming, as they are not heavily used and are separated from <b>normal</b> <b>traffic</b> by barrier walls. Both spans were briefly closed on April 9, 2006, to allow filming with stunts and pyrotechnics for the Denzel Washington film Déjà Vu. The spans also served as the anchor for the background {{in most of the}} outdoor scenes in the film A Love Song for Bobby Long.|$|E

5000|$|B. suis {{possesses}} smooth lipopolysaccharide (LPS), {{which has}} a full-length O-chain, as opposed to rough LPS, {{which has a}} truncated or no O-chain.

[...] In addition, this furtive entry into the macrophage does not affect the cell’s <b>normal</b> <b>trafficking.</b> The smooth LPS also inhibits host cell apoptosis by O-polysaccharides through a TNF-alpha-independent mechanism, which allows for B. suis to avoid the activation of the host immune system.|$|R
25|$|On {{the first}} day 190,000 {{vehicles}} moved into or within the zone during charging hours, a decrease of around 25% on <b>normal</b> <b>traffic</b> levels, partly due to it also being the half-term school holiday. A report from the Bow Group stated that historically, London congestion is at its worst during the morning rush hour, and that {{the early days of}} congestion charging had little impact on that critical time, the main effect occurring after 11am. Just over 100,000 motorists paid the charge personally, 15–20,000 were fleet vehicles paying under fleet arrangements, and it was believed around 10,000 liable motorists did not pay the due charge.|$|E

There were no other casualties and the ship was able to continue sailing normally. There was a more serious threat to the ship made on 17 August 1986 when a bomb threat was made against the ship in Stockholm. The passengers and crew were evacuated, and to ensure passenger safety they were taken to Turku onboard MS Svea instead of sailing to Helsinki as planned. Later the Silvia Regina departed Stockholm without passengers and resumed <b>normal</b> <b>traffic</b> in Helsinki the following day.|$|E
25|$|The Solaris Urbino 12 Hybrid uses a {{parallel}} hybrid system HDU {{made by the}} American company Eaton. It comprises inter alia with a 6-speed Eaton automatic gearbox and one electric motor with maximum power of 44kW (60hp). In <b>normal</b> <b>traffic</b> movement the power is on about 28kW (38hp). It operates with a Cummins ISB6.7EV 225B diesel engine, meeting {{the requirements of the}} EEV standard, with a maximum power of 165kW (225hp) and the volume of 6.7 dm. The Eaton gearbox transmits power to the rear axle. All batteries are lithium-ion (Li-Ion) made by the Japanese company Hitachi which have been placed under the platforms inside the vehicle. By this the appearance of the bus has changed and the look is different when compared with the traditional diesel engine powered buses. The cost of this system is about 70 thousand Euros.|$|E

50|$|To {{determine}} <b>normal</b> reference <b>traffic</b> for a network, the ITU {{recommends that}} a network traffic analyst must take measurements for the busiest hour {{of each day}} for a whole year. The busiest hour is defined as that four consecutive quarter hours whose traffic intensity is the greatest. Measurements taken outside the busy hour can be discarded. The reference intensity of traffic is then calculated by taking the average traffic intensity of the top thirty days in the year. Measurements taken on individual days can be discarded. This will give the <b>normal</b> high <b>traffic</b> intensity in the network, allowing network managers to make long-term strategic decisions.|$|R

25|$|On 12 June 1981, {{the brand}} new Silvia Regina was set in Silja Line's Helsinki–Stockholm service, joining her sister MS Finlandia that had been {{completed}} some four months earlier. The ship carried Rederi AB Svea funnel colours {{for only a few}} months, as the company was absorbed into its parent company Johnson Line in the end of 1982. As a result the Silvia Regina had received Johnson Line's blue/yellow funnel colours already before the refit. Soon after entering service a major design flaw was discovered in the ships. In order to maximise car carrying capacity they had been designed with very wide bows that made the ships very difficult to control, especially in poor weather conditions. As a result both ships were docked at Wärtsilä's Perno shipyard during the winter 1981-1982 and rebuilt with new bows that were notably sleeker along the waterline. The Silvia Regina was docked for bow reconstruction from 13 January onwards. After this was completed, she was again taken to Wärtsilä's Turku shipyard where new cabins were built and repairs were carried on in the ship's restaurants. Following completion of the reconstruction the ship re-entered service in Turku on 3 February, from where she made a crossing to Stockholm, after which she continued on her <b>normal</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
