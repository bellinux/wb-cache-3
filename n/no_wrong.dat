25|$|Sondhi's People's Alliance for Democracy soon {{gathered}} supporters among Dhammayuttika Nikaya {{disciples of}} Luang Ta Maha Bua, prominent socialites {{and members of}} the Thai royal family who claimed that Thaksin frequently insulted King Bhumibol Adulyadej, several state-enterprise unions who were against Thaksin's state-enterprise privatization plans, and various factions in the Royal Thai Army who claimed that Thaksin promoted only those who were loyal to him. The movement gained in popularity after Thaksin's family sold their share in Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings while making use of a regulation that exempted individuals from paying capital gains tax. The PAD led protests demanding that Thaksin pay additional taxes, despite the SEC and the Revenue Department saying that <b>no</b> <b>wrong</b> had been done.|$|E

25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he must know that no one does any wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who do <b>no</b> <b>wrong,</b> not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.|$|E

[...] The New York Timess reviewer, Lewis Nichols, stated that [...] "Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, who can do <b>no</b> <b>wrong,</b> have continued doing <b>no</b> <b>wrong</b> in adapting Liliom into a musical play. [...] Their Carousel is on the whole delightful." [...] Wilella Waldorf of the New York Post, however, complained, [...] "Carousel seemed to us a rather long evening. [...] The Oklahoma! formula is becoming a bit monotonous and so are Miss de Mille's ballets. [...] All right, go ahead and shoot!" [...] Dance Magazine gave Linn plaudits {{for her role as}} Louise, stating, [...] "Bambi doesn't come on until twenty minutes before eleven, and for the next forty minutes, she practically holds the audience in her hand".

500|$|Abbott {{stated that}} there were two reasons for what he {{considered}} to be the show's failure. The first was Rodgers and Hammerstein's overconfidence; they thought of themselves as Broadway's [...] "Golden Boys" [...] who could do <b>no</b> <b>wrong.</b> The other was the play-within-the-play, which had not been thoroughly thought out by anyone. According to Abbott, Hammerstein remained [...] "positively Sphinx-like" [...] on the subject. At a loss to understand the characters of the play-within-the play, Alton came up with nothing more than routine song-and-dance numbers. During the run, the duo approached choreographer Jerome Robbins and asked him if he could fix the dances. Robbins said that he could, but he would not, as [...] "it would kill Bob Alton". According to Hammerstein biographer Hugh Fordin, [...] " [...] intended contrast between onstage and backstage life was never achieved because the onstage show was so tepid and confusing." ...|$|E

[...] King George III was not optimistic {{about the possibility of}} a peace, [...] "yet I think it right to be attempted, whilst every act of vigour is unremittingly carried on". [...] Their powers were limited to granting of [...] "general and special pardons" [...] and to [...] "confer with any of his Majesty's subjects".

[...] Washington's adjutant, Joseph Reed, politely informed the messenger that no person with that title was in their army. [...] Admiral Howe's aide wrote that [...] "the Punctilio of an Address" [...] should not have prevented the letter's delivery, and Howe was said to be visibly annoyed by the rejection. [...] A second request, addressed to [...] "George Washington, Esq., etc." [...] was similarly rejected, although the messenger was told that Washington would receive one of Howe's adjutants.

500|$|After {{looking at}} agriculture, Cochrane {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} animals and genetic engineering. The question of whether an animal has a right not to be genetically engineered, he suggests, makes no sense, as live animals are not engineered, and embryos have no interests, so cannot have rights. Instead, Cochrane considers whether animals have a right {{not to have been}} engineered, arguing {{that it is not the}} case that they always do, and that if [...] "genetic engineering gives the animals lives with opportunities for well-being that are similar to or better than ordinary members of their species, then it is ordinarily permissible." [...] Cochrane then addresses four reasons to oppose this claim; first, the notion that genetic engineering instrumentalizes animals, second, the idea that genetic engineering is repugnant, third, that genetic engineering reveals a flaw in character (see virtue ethics) and fourth, that genetic engineering denies the dignity of animals. Cochrane finds none of these arguments reason to abandon the principle. Cochrane considers whether animals may ever have a right not to have been engineered. He argues that animals have a right not to be engineered such that they have lives not worth living. He then rejects some reasons for believing that animals have a right not to be engineered with diseases or disabilities, but concludes that they do, as engineered animals have an interest [...] "in having been engineered with sufficient opportunities for well-being", an interest which is strong enough to ground a concrete right. However, Cochrane argues that he is not advocating perfectionism, as he is concerned not with equal capacities between members of a species, but equal opportunities for well-being. Finally, Cochrane considers the possibility of engineering nonsentient, non-conscious livestock, arguing that, ordinarily, there is <b>no</b> <b>wrong</b> in engineering nonconscious entities.|$|E
500|$|After {{the fact}} pattern, Cardozo began his {{discussion}} of the law with [...] "the conduct of the defendant's guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relative to her it was not negligence at all." [...] Cardozo quoted Pollock on Torts and cited several cases for the proposition that [...] "proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do." [...] Only if there is a duty to the injured plaintiff, the breach of which causes injury, can there be liability. He defended his decision, [...] "a different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of contradictions." [...] Cardozo posed hypothetical situations: if a railway guard stumbles over a bundle of newspapers, and there are explosives within, will there be liability to an injured passenger {{at the other end of}} the platform? Will the result be different if the object containing the explosives is a valise instead? If there was negligence that day, Cardozo argued, it was only negligence that resulted in the fall and destruction of the package, and there was <b>no</b> <b>wrong</b> done by the railroad to Palsgraf for personal injury, [...] "the diversity of incidents emphasizes the futility of the effort to build the plaintiff's right upon the basis of a wrong to some one else." [...] The chief judge instructed, [...] "The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed". Cardozo did not absolve the defendant who knowingly unleashes a destructive force, such as by shooting a gun, just because the bullet takes an unexpected path. This is not such a case, Cardozo held: even if the railway guard had thrown down the package intentionally, without knowing the contents he could not knowingly risk harm to Palsgraf, and would not be liable. Negligence cannot impose liability where an intentional act would not.|$|E
