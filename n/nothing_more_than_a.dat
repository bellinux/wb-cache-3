5|$|Grant {{received}} {{an offer from}} the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London to pursue a PhD {{in the history of}} art, but decided not to take the offer because he failed to secure a grant. Viewing acting as <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> creative outlet, he joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society and starred in a successful touring production of Twelfth Night.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of April 5, 1779, Charles Messier {{recorded}} Pallas on a star chart he used to track {{the path of a}} comet (now known as C/1779 A1 (Bode)) that he observed in the spring of 1779, but apparently assumed it was <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> star.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, {{he struggled}} to earn a regular spot on the Rangers' roster and was often a healthy scratch. Rangers head coach John Muckler publicly declared {{before the beginning of}} Malhotra's second NHL campaign that he would be <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> career third-liner. Malhotra's potential was often at the centre of an ongoing dispute between Muckler and Smith.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{immediately}} after God of War II, Kratos, Gaia, {{and the other}} Titans ascend Mount Olympus to destroy the Olympian Gods. Poseidon launches a counter-assault against the Titans but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to flood the world. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them off the mountain. Gaia clings to the mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> pawn for the Titans' revenge.|$|E
5|$|Following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantines {{were left}} in an {{unstable}} position. The capture of Constantinople in 1261 and subsequent campaigning did not come at a good time — the weakening of the Sultanate of Rum resulted in many beyliks breaking away as autonomous states, such as the Emirate founded by Osman I. Although this weakening of power gave the Empire of Nicaea a temporary free hand, it was <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> small respite not capitalized {{as much as it}} could have been.|$|E
5|$|This {{dedication}} to reading and study might, in another boy, have been <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> {{reaction to the}} impending examinations — but not in Jan's case. What made this particular episode revealing was that the books found under his bedclothes were largely unconnected with his studies. In Riebeek West he developed a lifelong habit, that of reading avidly outside the prescribed curriculum, seeking knowledge for its own sake.|$|E

5|$|When Lounsberry {{learned that}} a {{military}} column (including the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment commanded by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer) would soon leave Fort Abraham Lincoln for the Montana Territory, he agreed to accompany Custer and provide news coverage. However, {{at the last minute}} Lounsberry's wife fell ill, so the editor asked Kellogg to take his place. Lounsberry expected Kellogg would cover <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> sensational military victory.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{receives}} a package containing his childhood toys, which consist of <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> scouring pad, a rusted spatula, and a dog-shaped soap bar. The toys make Bob recall memories of constantly working at his father's restaurant, and {{he realizes that}} his job deprived him of a normal childhood. Worried that he {{is doing the same}} to his own children, he fires Tina, Gene and Louise and encourages them to enjoy their summer vacation. In their place, he hires newly released bank robber Mickey, whom the family had previously befriended, to do various jobs around the restaurant, in exchange for free meals and shelter in the basement.|$|E
5|$|Danebury was {{abandoned}} around 100BC, {{in common with}} the trend across Britain for hill forts to fall out of use around that time. Once again, the east gate was burnt down, although this time it was not replaced. Most of the inhabitants deserted Danebury, and groups of bodies were disposed of in charnel pits. The site continued in use, but on a much smaller scale than before. Buildings were left to decay and the interior of the fort became used for grazing. By the start of the 1st centuryAD, the settlement of Danebury was probably <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> single farm.|$|E

5|$|Gladiators {{were trained}} combatants {{who might be}} slaves, convicts, or free volunteers. Death was not a {{necessary}} or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training represented a costly and time-consuming investment. By contrast, noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena {{with little or no}} training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival. Physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> dressed-up form of human sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|In 1798, {{the revolutionary}} French {{government}} conquered Switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution. This centralised {{the government of}} the country, effectively abolishing the cantons: moreover, Mülhausen joined France and Valtellina valley, the Cisalpine Republic, separating from Switzerland. The new regime, known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. It had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> French satellite state. The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the French Army and the local population's resistance to the occupation.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began on}} 18 September 1967 {{with a budget}} of £83,000. Thirty-two {{thousand}} pounds was provided by AIP, with £12,000 for Price's expenditures and fees, and £20,000 for production costs. Philip Waddilove, a former BBC radio and record producer, contributed £5,000 in return for associate producer billing. Although the film would be the biggest budgeted title in Tigon's history, for AIP their part of the budget represented a relatively small expenditure of money. Not much in terms of real quality was expected by AIP heads Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson, and the movie {{was intended to be}} <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> tax write-off.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} panned by {{audience}} entirely and was mocked in every manner for its amateur depiction and witless technical aspects (sound, cinematography, script, story, acting, editing). Sam Anderson proved himself <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> untrained actor.|$|R
60|$|The {{object of}} art is not simply truth but complex beauty. Art itself is really a form of exaggeration, and selection, which is the very spirit of art, is <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> {{intensified}} mode of over-emphasis.|$|R
5|$|The {{depression}} began {{a movement}} to the northwest upon formation and {{on the night of}} October 31, the depression ran into a newly-forming upper-level low near the Yucatan Peninsula. The interaction with the upper-level low caused shearing in the depression, and broke apart the previous low-level circulation that was developing. By the morning of November 1, the depression was <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> swirl of low-level clouds near the center of circulation. After this, the depression could no longer attain the circulation it had previously developed. During the period of November 2 and 3, the depression moved to the northeast, crossing over the islands of Jamaica, Cayman and Cuba and then entering the southern parts of the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Within 90 {{years of}} Osman I's {{establishment}} of the Ottoman beylik, Byzantine Asia Minor had ceased to exist and by ca. 1380, Byzantine Thrace was lost to the Ottomans. By ca. 1400, the once mighty Byzantine Empire was <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> collection of the Despotate of the Morea, a few Aegean islands and a strip of land in Thrace {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the Capital. The Crusade of Nicopolis in 1396, Timur's invasion in 1402 and the final Crusade of Varna in 1444 allowed a ruined Constantinople to stave off defeat until 1453. With the conclusion of the war Ottoman supremacy became established in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the Roman Kingdom {{was founded}} in 753 BC, and was ruled by a {{succession}} of seven kings. The last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, ruled in a tyrannical manner and, in 510 BC, his son Sextus Tarquinius raped a noblewoman named Lucretia. Lucretia, {{the wife of a}} senator named Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, committed suicide because of the rape, and this led to a conspiracy which drove Tarquin from the city. With Tarquin's expulsion, the Roman Republic was founded, and the chief conspirators, Collatinus and the senator Lucius Junius Brutus, were elected as the first Roman Consul (chief-executive). While this story may be <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> legend which later Romans created in order to explain their past, it is likely that Rome had been ruled by a series of kings, who probably were, as the legends suggest, overthrown quickly.|$|E

5|$|The concerto {{also calls}} on the soloist to be <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> accompanist to the {{orchestra}} for extended periods, such as the ricochet arpeggios {{at the start of}} the recapitulation. This too was novel for a violin concerto of its time.|$|R
5|$|All {{the guests}} agree to stay — except Jean and Douglas. Due to their daughter's long-awaited success, {{they decide to}} return home but {{on the way to}} the airport, their taxi gets caught in a traffic jam. A {{rickshaw}} driver says that he can take only one of them. Jean sees it as a sign that it is time to split with Douglas; she bids him farewell and departs. He winds up at another hotel, discovering that it's <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> brothel and drug den, and spends the rest of the night wandering the streets. He returns to the hotel just as Evelyn is leaving for work, and asks her out on a date. A closing montage with a voiceover shows Muriel checking in customers in an elegant renovated lobby, Madge dining with a handsome older Indian man, and Norman and Carol living happily together. Sonny and Sunaina are shown riding a motorbike and passing Douglas and Evelyn on another bike.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald's {{goal was}} to produce a {{literary}} work which would truly prove himself as a writer, and Gatsby {{did not have the}} commercial success of his two previous novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later. Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character. According to his own ledger, now made available online by University of South Carolina's Thomas Cooper library, he earned only $2,000 from the book. Although 1926 brought Owen Davis's stage adaption and the Paramount-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye. For several years afterward, the general public believed The Great Gatsby to be <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> nostalgic period piece.|$|E
5|$|From there, Crash {{crosses to}} the second of Cortex's islands. Wumpa Island, hosting a large tree, has been long {{abandoned}} and there is <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> jungle, a lizard-infested city, dilapidated bridges high in the mountains, and the ruins of an ancient temple. However, having discovered that Crash is making {{his way across the}} islands, Cortex dispatches the deranged Ripper Roo on the island in a temple {{at the start of a}} creek. Crash manages to cross the river and, after avoiding contact with his razor-sharp toenails, knocks Ripper Roo out cold beside a waterfall, and successfully makes his way through the city and the temples. Crash also defeats another of Cortex's mutants, the muscular Koala Kong, in a volcanic cave mine before finally crossing to the Cortex Island. Crash then navigates the Cortex Power station, a huge power plant that provides Cortex's castle with energy while polluting the nearby area. When he reaches the factory core, Crash battles and defeats the CEO of Cortex Power, Pinstripe Potoroo, damaging the power plant.|$|E
