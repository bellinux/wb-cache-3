The IMA was recognized for serving its community through a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>programs,</b> including Viewfinders, a school program that serves 9,000 local students a year. IMLS also cited the IMA's free admission, greening and sustainability initiatives, efforts to reach virtual audiences, and improvements in accessibility throughout the museum.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>programs,</b> {{such as the}} IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, {{integrated}} anti-radiation sensors into a drone or missile air frames {{coupled with}} command and control and loitering capabilities. This allowed the attacking force to place relatively cheap munitions in place over suspected SAM sites, and to attack promptly the moment the SAM battery is visible. This integrated {{the use of a}} drone as a baiting decoy with the attack role into one small and relatively cheap platform in comparison to the alternative wild weasel jet fighter.|$|E
30|$|The raw {{error rate}} of MLC PRAM {{increases}} as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>programming</b> errors increases. Thus, a flexible ECC scheme that can support higher error correction capability over time is desirable. Flexible ECC scheme is implemented by using product code which corrects errors in two dimensions. When the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>programming</b> cycles is low, it {{is sufficient to}} do ECC in one dimension. As the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>programming</b> cycles increases, the flexible ECC scheme uses ECC in two dimensions to enhance the error correction capability.|$|R

5|$|Some Lucian calypsonians {{recorded}} in the 1980s, mostly on 45-RPM discs which remain largely unavailable today. The Lucian music industry is quite small scale, due to the island's small market, its lack of recording studios and record producers, the widespread bootlegging of cassettes, and the general unavailability of funding for musical ventures. Saint Lucia is home to several radio stations including Radio St. Lucia and Radio Caribbean International, which play a variety of popular music; since 1989, St Lucian radio stations have played an increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>programs</b> about Lucian culture and in the local Creole tongue.|$|E

The student population is made up solely of local students living within commuting distance of the college. Angus College offers courses up to Higher National Diploma (HND) level in a variety of trade related and academic disciplines from construction to Social Sciences, as well as a sizeable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>programs</b> relating to computing, information technology and office administration. A large number of the student body are mature students taking evening classes related to computing, digital photography and various software packages.|$|E
