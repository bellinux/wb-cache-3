The unprovenanced Jehoash Inscription Tablet and James Ossuary are of potentially immense historical and cultural importance. <b>Nevertheless,</b> <b>t</b> hey both were rejected by workers based on the oxygen isotope technique which provided the major foundational evidence of forgery in the longest running archaeological trial in Israel.

The initial incongruence between the oxygen isotopes of the speleothems of the Soreq cave (Israel) purported to represent the unique composition of Jerusalem rainfall, and the patina on the artifacts, can be readily explained by the accretion of materials and geo-biochemical processes expected in normal patina formation in the Jerusalem region. The patina formation involves sporadic events in disequilibrium kinetic processes that are opposed to the equilibrium formation of speleothems in a sealed cave. Moreover, 23 of 56 patina samples (41 %) on well-documented ancient artifacts from Israel yielded oxygen isotope values greater or lower than the expected speleothem values of - 4 δ 18 O ‰ [PDB] to - 6 δ 18 O ‰ [PDB].

40|$|The {{interaction}} of protozoan parasites with innate host defences {{is critical in}} determining {{the character of the}} subsequent infection. The initial steps in the encounter of Toxoplasma gondii with the vertebrate immune system provide a striking example of this important aspect of the host-parasite relationship. In immuno-competent individuals this intracellular protozoan produces an asymptomatic chronic infection as part of its strategy for transmission. <b>Nevertheless,</b> <b>T.</b> gondii is inherently a highly virulent pathogen. The rapid induction by the parasite of a potent cell-mediated immune response that both limits its growth and drives conversion to a dormant cyst stage explains this apparent paradox. Studies with gene-deficient mice have demonstrated the interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) -dependent production of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) to be of paramount importance in controlling early parasite growth. However, this seems to be independent of nitric oxide production as mice deficient in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumour necrosis factor receptor were able to control early growth of T. gondii, although, they later succumbed to infection. Nitric oxide does, however, seem to be important in controlling persistent infection; treating chronic infection with iNOS metabolic inhibitors results in disease reactivation. Preliminary evidence implicates neutrophils in effector pathways against this parasite distinct from that described for macrophages. Once initiated, IL- 12 -dependent IFN-gamma production in synergy with other proinflammatory cytokines can positively feed back on itself to induce 'cytokine shock'.

40|$|Let m_t(α) {{denote the}} t-metric Mahler {{measure of the}} {{algebraic}} number α. Recent work of the first author established that the infimum in m_t(α) is attained by a single point α̅= (α_ 1, [...] .,α_N) ∈ Q^N for all sufficiently large <b>t.</b> <b>Nevertheless,</b> no efficient method for locating α̅ is known. In this article, we define a new tree data structure, called a factorization tree, which enables us to find α̅ when α∈ Q. We establish several basic properties of factorization trees, and use these properties to locate α̅ in previously unknown cases...|$|R
