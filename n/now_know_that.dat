5|$|Originally, this genus was {{believed}} to be a prosauropod because of the knife-shaped teeth found near its fossils, which fit in with the idea that prosauropods were omnivorous. Scientists <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass. Vulcanodon is now known to be a true sauropod. Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus, both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae, though this has not been universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E

5|$|Stan {{tries to}} persuade Randy {{to tell the}} truth about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses in order to avoid embarrassment. As the pair works on the warp drive, an Intergalactic Police ship {{approaches}} Earth; McGeezax cloaks his ship and drags Stan out of sight as a hostage, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers' questions. The officers say that McGeezax stole a large sum of space cash, but no one admits to seeing him, and the officers leave. Randy then provides a diversion for McGeezax while Stan, at Randy's insistence, stabs him to death with a shank. McGeezax's ship is found to contain the stolen space cash, but instead of returning it, Randy persuades everyone to divide it among themselves. Randy, in contact with all world leaders, buys other countries' silence by giving them a share. Four days later, the officers return to South Park. They <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> McGeezax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, but everyone denies finding any space cash.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} point {{to consider is}} that Tolkowsky did not follow {{the path of a}} ray that was reflected more than twice in the diamond. However, we <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> a diamond's appearance is composed of many light paths that reflect considerably more than two times within that diamond. Once again, we can see that Tolkowsky's predictions are helpful in explaining optimal diamond performance, but they are incomplete by today's technological standards.|$|E

25|$|Like {{others before}} and after him, he also noticed that the Moon has a {{noticeable}} parallax, i.e., that it appears displaced from its calculated position (compared to the Sun or stars), and the difference is greater when closer to the horizon. He knew that this is because in the then-current models the Moon circles {{the center of the}} Earth, but the observer is at the surface—the Moon, Earth and observer form a triangle with a sharp angle that changes all the time. From the size of this parallax, the distance of the Moon as measured in Earth radii can be determined. For the Sun however, there was no observable parallax (we <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it is about 8.8", several times smaller than the resolution of the unaided eye).|$|E
25|$|There {{is also no}} {{evidence}} that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Paul Williams has {{also noted that the}} Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. Membership in these nikāyas, or monastic sects, continues today with the Dharmaguptaka nikāya in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda nikāya in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore, Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools. Paul Harrison clarifies that while monastic Mahāyānists belonged to a nikāya, not all members of a nikāya were Mahāyānists. From Chinese monks visiting India, we <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.|$|E
25|$|Herodotus {{wrote his}} Histories in the Ionian dialect, {{yet he was}} born in Halicarnassus, which was a Dorian settlement. According to the Suda, Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of Samos, to which he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and {{grandson}} of Artemisia. The Suda also informs us that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant. Due to recent discoveries of inscriptions at Halicarnassus dated to about Herodotus's time, we <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the Ionic dialect was used in Halicarnassus in some official documents, so {{there is no need to}} assume (like the Suda) that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere. Further, the Suda is the only source which we have for the role played by Herodotus as the heroic liberator of his birthplace. That itself is a good reason to doubt such a romantic account.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his newfound}} top {{prospect}} status Houtteman remained in Buffalo {{at the beginning}} of the 1947 season before being recalled to the Tigers in July. He was relegated to the bullpen for a time, and saw little action. But after Hal Newhouser, Fred Hutchinson and Dizzy Trout were used in two days, Tiger manager Steve O'Neill decided to start Houtteman against the Washington Senators for only the second start of his career. He tossed a five-hit shutout and Tiger general manager Billy Evans said, [...] "In 40years I've never seen a better pitching job by a first-year pitcher. We <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Houtteman is really a big leaguer". He followed this with another five-hit victory against the Boston Red Sox, then pitched a three-hit shutout in September against the St. Louis Browns. He finished the season at 7–2 with a 3.42 ERA, seven complete games and two shutouts. His performance in 1947 caught the attention of New York Yankees star and future Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who said of Houtteman and Bob Lemon, [...] "They have more stuff and more pitching sense than any other young fellows I've seen come up in a long while".|$|E

He wrote articles for musical journals and for the second edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, edited the first volume of Purcell's Welcome Songs for the Purcell Society, and was for a while involved in adult education in the University Extension Lectures. From 1904 to 1906 he was music editor of a new hymn-book, The English Hymnal, of which he later said, [...] "I <b>now</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> two years of close association with some of the best (as well as some of the worst) tunes in the world was a better musical education than any amount of sonatas and fugues". Always committed to music-making for the whole community, he helped found the amateur Leith Hill Music Festival in 1905, and was appointed its principal conductor, a post he held until 1953.|$|E
