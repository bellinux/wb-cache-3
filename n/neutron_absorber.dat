5|$|Lithium-6 {{is valued}} {{as a source}} {{material}} for tritium production and as a <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber</b> in nuclear fusion. Natural lithium contains about 7.5% lithium-6 from which large amounts of lithium-6 have been produced by isotope separation for use in nuclear weapons. Lithium-7 gained interest for use in nuclear reactor coolants.|$|E
5|$|The nuclei {{of several}} hafnium {{isotopes}} can each absorb multiple neutrons. This makes hafnium a good material {{for use in}} the control rods for nuclear reactors. Its neutron-capture cross-section is about 600 times that of zirconium. (Other elements that are good neutron-absorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron.) Excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion-resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of pressurized water reactors. The German research reactor FRM II uses hafnium as a <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber.</b> It is also common in military reactors, particularity in US naval reactors, but seldom found in civilian ones, the first core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station (a conversion of a naval reactor) being a notable exception.|$|E
5|$|The major {{commercial}} {{application of}} samarium is in samariumâ€“cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization {{second only to}} neodymium magnets; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above , without losing their magnetic properties, due to the alloy's higher Curie point. The radioactive isotope samarium-153 is the active component of the drug samarium (153Sm) lexidronam (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber</b> and is therefore added to the control rods of nuclear reactors. It is also formed as a decay product during the reactor operation {{and is one of the}} important factors considered in the reactor design and operation. Other applications of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and an X-ray laser.|$|E
40|$|Successful {{immobilization}} of actinides (Am, Cm, Th, Pu, Np, etc.) in crystalline and amorphous host matrixes {{with appropriate}} <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers</b> (B, Hf, Gd, etc.) requires sound scientific {{knowledge of the}} local chemical environments of both the actinides (An) and the <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers</b> and their interaction with the host matrixes. This understanding leads to a more systematic and efficient approach to predicting solubilities than the strictly empirical approach now used. The goals of this ongoing research are to determine solubility limits of representative actinides (Pu and U) and <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers</b> (Hf and Gd) in crystalline and amorphous matrixes and to determine solution mechanisms of these species in {{the two types of}} systems. Actinides and <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers</b> in amorphous systems have been studied at PNNL in collaboration with LBNL and University of Michigan and in crystalline systems at ANSTO. We believe {{that we are in a}} position to understand the chemical systematics of silicate melts so that the solubility of actinides, <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers,</b> and, we would suggest, other metal species in glass no longer must be determined empirically but can be calculated from a set of equilibrium constants in a fashion similar to aqueous systems...|$|R

50|$|Current use of TiB2 {{appears to}} be limited to {{specialized}} applications in such areas as impact resistant armor, cutting tools, crucibles, <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers</b> and wear resistant coatings.|$|R
5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber,</b> or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
25|$|Easier to control. A molten fuel reactor has the {{advantage}} of easy removal of xenon-135. Xenon-135, an important <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber,</b> makes solid fueled reactors difficult to control. In a molten fueled reactor, xenon-135 can be removed. In solid-fuel reactors, xenon-135 remains in the fuel and interferes with reactor control.|$|E
25|$|There are two independent, {{fast-acting}} safety {{shutdown systems}} as well. Shutoff rods are held above the reactor by electromagnets, and drop under gravity {{into the core}} to quickly end criticality. This system works even {{in the event of}} a complete power failure, as the electromagnets only hold the rods out of the reactor when power is available. A secondary system injects a high-pressure gadolinium nitrate <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber</b> solution into the calandria.|$|E
40|$|Criticality {{safety issues}} for {{disposal}} of the ANL ceramic waste were examined for configurations within the waste package. Co-disposal of ceramic waste and DOE spent fuel is discussed briefly; co-disposal of ANL ceramic and metal wastes is examined in detail. Calculations indicate that no significant potential for criticality exists until essentially {{all of the}} important <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers</b> are flushed from the degraded ceramic waste. Even {{if all of the}} <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers</b> are removed from the ceramic waste rubble, the package remains far subcritical if the blended salts used in ceramic waste production have an initial U- 235 enrichment below 40 %...|$|R
5000|$|The {{power control}} by {{reduction}} of the moderator density (vapour bubbles in the water) instead of by addition of <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers</b> (boric acid in PWR) leads to breeding of U-238 by fast neutrons, producing fissile Pu-239.|$|R
50|$|Raschig rings {{made from}} {{borosilicate}} glass are sometimes {{employed in the}} handling of nuclear materials, where they are used inside vessels and tanks containing solutions of fissile material, for example solutions of enriched uranyl nitrate, acting as <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers</b> and preventing a potential criticality accident.|$|R
25|$|Boric acid, {{also called}} {{hydrogen}} borate, boracic acid, orthoboric acid and , is a weak, monobasic Lewis acid of boron, {{which is often}} used as an antiseptic, insecticide, flame retardant, <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber,</b> or precursor to other chemical compounds. It has the chemical formula H3BO3 (sometimes written B(OH)3), and exists {{in the form of}} colorless crystals or a white powder that dissolves in water. When occurring as a mineral, it is called sassolite.|$|E
25|$|Another huge {{advantage}} of the liquid core {{is its ability to}} release xenon gas which normally acts as a <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber</b> and causes structural occlusions in solid fuel elements (leading to early replacement of solid fuel rods with over 98% of the nuclear fuel unburned, including many long lived actinides). In contrast Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) are capable of retaining the fuel mixture for significantly extended periods, which not only increases fuel efficiency dramatically, but also incinerates the vast majority of its own waste as part of the normal operational characteristics.|$|E
25|$|At 20:05 JST on 12 March, the Japanese {{government}} ordered seawater to be {{injected into}} Unit 1 {{in a new}} effort to cool the reactor core. The treatment had been held {{as a last resort}} since it ruins the reactor. TEPCO started seawater cooling at 20:20, adding boric acid as a <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber</b> to prevent a criticality accident. The water would take five to ten hours to fill the reactor core, after which the reactor would cool down in around ten days. The injection of seawater into the reactor pressure vessel was done by fire department trucks. At 01:10 JST on 14 March, injection of seawater was halted for two hours because all available water in the plant pools had run out (similarly, feed to Unit 3 was halted). NISA news reports stated 70% of the fuel rods had been damaged when uncovered.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a shielding material in general increases with its atomic number, called Z, except for neutron shielding which is more readily shielded {{by the likes of}} <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers</b> and moderators such as compounds of boron e.g. boric acid, cadmium, carbon and hydrogen respectively.|$|R
50|$|The burn {{up of the}} {{absorbing}} isotopes {{is another}} limiting lifespan factor. They may be reduced by capturing long isotope rows of the same element or by not using <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers</b> for trimming. For example, in pebble bed reactors or in possible new type 7lithium-moderated and -cooled reactors that use fuel and absorber pebbles.|$|R
50|$|In the {{prismatic}} designs, {{control rods}} are inserted in holes {{cut in the}} graphite blocks {{that make up the}} core. The VHTR will be controlled like current PBMR designs if it utilizes a pebble bed core, the control rods will be inserted in the surrounding graphite reflector. Control can also be attained by adding pebbles containing <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers.</b>|$|R
500|$|Another group, under Volney C. Wilson, was {{responsible}} for instrumentation. They also fabricated the control rods, which were cadmium sheets nailed to flat wooden strips, cadmium being a potent <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber,</b> and the scram line, a Manila rope that when cut would drop a control rod into the pile and stop the reaction. Richard Fox, who made the control-rod mechanism for the pile, remarked that the manual speed control that the operator had over the rods was simply a variable resistor, controlling an electric motor that would [...] the clothesline wire over a pulley that also had two lead weights attached to ensure it would fail-safe and return to its zero position when released.|$|E
500|$|Some {{radioactive}} isotopes of xenon (for example, 133Xe and 135Xe) {{are produced}} by neutron irradiation of fissionable material within nuclear reactors. 135Xe is of considerable significance {{in the operation of}} nuclear fission reactors. 135Xe has a huge cross section for thermal neutrons, 2.6Ã—106barns, and operates as a <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber</b> or [...] "poison" [...] that can slow or stop the chain reaction after a period of operation. This was discovered in the earliest nuclear reactors built by the American Manhattan Project for plutonium production. Fortunately the designers had made provisions in the design to increase the reactor's reactivity (the number of neutrons per fission that go on to fission other atoms of nuclear fuel).|$|E
500|$|In 1942 Graves [...] {{was invited}} {{back to the}} University of Chicago by Arthur H. Compton. Graves had already {{received}} a request from the MIT Radiation Laboratory to work on radar, and he {{asked if he could}} contribute more to Compton's project. Compton replied that he could. He joined the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, and helped build the first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1. Graves, Harold V. Lichtenberger and Warren Nyer formed Enrico Fermi's [...] "suicide squad" [...] or [...] "liquid-control squad", assigned to smash [...] glass bottles containing a solution of cadmium sulfate over the reactor with hammers if something went wrong. Cadmium is a strong <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber</b> and Fermi hoped that this would halt a runaway nuclear chain reaction, if the reactor control rods proved to be incapable of halting it in the first place.|$|E
50|$|RTGs {{and nuclear}} power {{reactors}} use very different nuclear reactions. Nuclear power reactors use controlled nuclear fission in a chain reaction. The rate of the reaction can be controlled with <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers,</b> so power can be varied with demand or shut off entirely for maintenance. However, care is needed to avoid uncontrolled operation at dangerously high power levels.|$|R

500|$|Fermi and Szilard {{met with}} representatives of National Carbon Company, who {{manufactured}} graphite, and Szilard made another important discovery. He asked about impurities in [...] graphite, and learned that it usually contained boron, a <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber.</b> He then had special boron-free graphite produced. Had he not done so, they might have concluded, as the German nuclear researchers did, that graphite was unsuitable {{for use as a}} neutron moderator. Like the German researchers, Fermi and Szilard still believed that enormous quantities of uranium would be required for an atomic bomb, and therefore concentrated on producing a controlled chain reaction. Fermi determined that a fissioning uranium atom produced 1.73 neutrons on average. It was enough, but a careful design was called for to minimize losses. Szilard worked up various designs for a nuclear reactor. [...] "If the uranium project could have been run on ideas alone," [...] Wigner later remarked, [...] "no one but Leo Szilard would have been needed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Light water (the {{ordinary}} H2O) is both {{a neutron}} moderator and a <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber.</b> This means that not only can it slow down neutrons to velocities in equilibrium with surrounding molecules ("thermalize" [...] them {{and turn them into}} low-energy neutrons that {{are far more likely to}} interact with the uranium-235 nuclei than the fast neutrons produced by fission initially), but it can also absorb some of them outright. Heavy water is also a good neutron moderator, but is expensive to produce and does not absorb neutrons as easily, so the use of enriched fuel is not required to produce a meaningful power output.|$|E

Fe-based amorphous metal formulations with chromium, molybdenum and tungsten have shown the corrosion resistance believed to be necessary for such applications.

The boron content of these materials, and their stability at high neutron doses, enable them to serve as high efficiency <b>neutron</b> <b>absorbers</b> for criticality control.

2500|$|Most of {{the reactor}} control rods are {{inserted}} from above; 24 shortened rods are inserted from below {{and are used}} to augment the axial power distribution control of the core. With the exception of 12 automatic rods, the control rods have a [...] long graphite section at the end, separated by a [...] long telescope (which creates a water-filled space between the graphite and the absorber), and a boron carbide <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber</b> section. The role of the graphite section, known as [...] "displacer," [...] is to enhance {{the difference between the}} neutron flux attenuation levels of inserted and retracted rods, as the graphite displaces water that would otherwise act as a <b>neutron</b> <b>absorber,</b> although much weaker than boron carbide; a control rod channel filled with graphite absorbs fewer neutrons than when filled with water, so the difference between inserted and retracted control rod is increased. When the control rod is fully retracted, the graphite displacer is located {{in the middle of the}} core height, with 1.25m of water at each of its ends. The displacement of water in the lower 1.25m of the core as the rod moves down causes a local increase of reactivity in the bottom of the core as the graphite part of the control rod passes that section. This [...] "positive scram" [...] effect was discovered in 1983 at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. The control rod channels are cooled by an independent water circuit and kept at [...] The narrow space between the rod and its channel hinders water flow around the rods during their movement and acts as a fluid damper, which is the primary cause of their slow insertion time (nominally 18â€“21 seconds for the RCPS rods, or about 0.4m/s). After the Chernobyl disaster, the control rod servos on other RBMK reactors were exchanged to allow faster rod movements, and even faster movement was achieved by cooling of the control rod tubes by a thin layer of water while letting the rods themselves move in gas.|$|E
