25|$|Animation for A Charlie Brown Christmas {{was created}} by Bill Melendez Productions. Mendelson had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> or not {{completing}} a half-hour's worth of animation would be possible given the production's six-month schedule, but Melendez confirmed its feasibility. In actuality, animation was only completed {{in the final four}} months of production. CBS initially wanted an hour's worth of animation, but Melendez talked them down to a half-hour special, believing an hour of television animation was too much. Having never worked on a half-hour special before, Melendez phoned Bill Hanna of Hanna-Barbera for advice, who declined to give any. CBS gave a budget of $76,000 to produce the show, and it went over budget, costing $96,000. The first step in creating the animation was to make a pencil drawing, afterwards inking and painting the drawing onto a cel. The cel was then placed onto a painted background. There are 13,000 drawings in the special, with 12 frames per second to create the illusion of movement.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} integenerational {{equity in the}} use of natural {{resources}} is discussed in the context of coal mining conversion. An attempt to determine if there is a clear-cut benefit to future generations in setting minimum coal extraction efficiency standards in mining is made. It is demonstrated that preserving fossil fuels beyond the economically efficient level is not necessarily beneficial to future generations even in terms of their own preferences. Setting fossil fuel conservation targets for intermediate products (i. e. energy) may increase the quantities of fossil fuels available to future generations and hence lower the costs, but there may be serious disadvantages to future generations as well. The use of relatively inexpensive fossil fuels in this generation may result in more infrastructure development and more knowledge production available to future generations. The value of fossil fuels versus these other endowments in the future depends on many factors which cannot possibly be evaluated at present. Since there is <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>whether</b> future generations are being helped or harmed, it is recommended that integenerational equity not be used as a factor in setting coal mine extraction efficiency standards, or in establishing requirements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: Cancer {{management}} is increasingly being delivered within a multidisciplinary team (MDT) environment, involving several highly skilled professionals. There {{is therefore a}} good indication {{of the importance of}} good and effective communication skills within these collaborative care teams. Aim: The study examined the process of communication, information transfer and collaboration among the MDT in cancer management. Methods: A quantitative descriptive survey using a semi structured questionnaire was administered to Forty five (45) multidisciplinary health professionals. Data collected was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) version 18. 0 and discussions were based on the responses from the participants. Results: More than half (54. 5 %) of the respondents used verbal communication whiles 31. 8 % described telephone as the most difficult mode of communication for them. Lack of additional education in communication skills was identified among 75 % of the respondents. There were 29. 5 % of the respondents who indicated that Staff especially the seniors show disrespect to the juniors. In all, 34 % of the participants had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> about <b>whether</b> protocols or guidelines in communication existed. Conclusion: There was a high level collaboration level among the MDT involved in the management of cancer. Most of these professionals however, had no further education in communication skills and several recommendations wer...|$|R

2500|$|The Insider was Rao's {{first novel}} {{and had been}} in the making for 20 years before it was {{published}} in 1998 by Penguin India. The book largely received negative reviews from both reviewers and politicians. Reviewing Indian roman à clefs in 2010, Nilanjana Roy noted that [...] "This 1998 novel by a former Indian PM is now justly forgotten [...] At 767 pages, [...] suffered from the defects of a great deal of Indian political writing—the gossip wasn’t good enough to justify the prolixity". Similarly, Sunanda Ray of The Telegraph noted that [...] "though grateful for the gift, I did not find the book gripping reading. Therefore, I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> Anand, the central figure, matches Narasimha Rao in every detail". A revised and expanded edition of the book that was published by Penguin in 2000 was reviewed by The Hindu as [...] "a book making heavy demands on the doggedness of a reader for withstanding an 833-page infliction from a former Prime Minister". On political grounds members of the Congress Party including Najma Heptullah were critical of Rao's novel while many BJP supporters dismissed it as a piece of sleazy writing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{incremental}} research techniques developed at IBM eventually became {{dominant in the}} field after DARPA, in the mid-80s, returned to NLP research and imposed that methodology to participating teams, shared common goals, data, and precise evaluation metrics. The Continuous Speech Recognition Group's research, which required large amounts of data to train the algorithms, {{eventually led to the}} creation of the Linguistic Data Consortium. In the 1980s, although the broader problem of speech recognition remained unsolved, they sought to apply the methods developed to other problems; machine translation and stock value prediction were both seen as options. A group of IBM researchers went on to work for Renaissance Technologies. Jelinek wrote, [...] "The performance of the Renaissance fund is legendary, but I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> any methods we pioneered at IBM have ever been used. My former colleagues will not tell me: theirs is a very hush-hush operation!" [...] Methods very similar to those developed for achieving speech recognition are at the base of most machine translation systems in use today. Observers have said that Pierce's paradigm, according to which engineering achievements in this area would be built on scientific progress, has been inverted, with the achievements in engineering being at the base of a number of scientific findings.|$|E

In these early days he was not fortunate in friends--looking back I see most clearly how much we both wanted a man of riper wisdom. We had no religion between the pair of us--that was the flaw. How very different was our last intimacy in Gladstone Terrace. But youth must learn--looking back over these wasted opportunities, I must try rather to remember what I did right, than to bewail the much that I left undone and knew not how to do. I see that even you have allowed yourself to have regrets. Dear Miss Ferrier, sure you were his angel. We all had something to be glad of, {{in so far as}} we had understood and loved and perhaps a little helped the gentle spirit; but you may certainly be proud.

To sum up all of my inquiries, I learned or heard a lot that left me completely bewildered, so that I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> a bonefish was a joke or the grandest fish that swims.

It will want a heap of oversight and much will not stand, but the pace is good; about 28 Cornhill pp. drafted in seven days, and almost all of it dialogue--indeed I may say all, for I have dismissed the rest very summarily in the draft: one can always tickle at that. At the same rate, the draft should be finished in ten days more; and then I shall have the pleasure of beginning again at the beginning. Ah damned job! I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> or not Otto will be good.

6000|$|Winterborne {{went and}} stood close to them; the timber-merchant spoke, and {{continued}} his buying; Grace merely smiled. To justify his presence there Winterborne began bidding for timber and fagots {{that he did}} not want, pursuing the occupation in an abstracted mood, in which the auctioneer's voice seemed {{to become one of the}} natural sounds of the woodland. A few flakes of snow descended, at the sight of which a robin, alarmed at these signs of imminent winter, and seeing that no offence was meant by the human invasion, came and perched on the tip of the fagots that were being sold, and looked into the auctioneer's face, while waiting for some chance crumb from the bread-basket. Standing a little behind Grace, Winterborne observed how one flake would sail downward and settle on a curl of her hair, and how another would choose her shoulder, and another the edge of her bonnet, which took up so much of his attention that his biddings proceeded incoherently; and when the auctioneer said, every now and then, with a nod towards him, [...] "Yours, Mr. Winterborne," [...] he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> he had bought fagots, poles, or logwood.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a troubled}} uncomfortable {{evening in the}} cars. There was thunder in the air, which helped to keep us restless.

[...] It was truly strange to note how the talk ceased at that, and the faces began to lengthen. I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> musically this air is to be considered good or bad; but it belongs to that class of art which may be best described as a brutal assault upon the feelings. Pathos must be relieved by dignity of treatment. If you wallow naked in the pathetic, like the author of [...] "Home, sweet home," [...] you make your hearers weep in an unmanly fashion; and even while yet they are moved, they despise themselves and hate the occasion of their weakness. It did not come to tears that night, for the experiment was interrupted.

[...] "I've heard about enough of that," [...] he added; [...] "give us something about the good country we're going to."

60|$|Not a {{word was}} spoken {{as the boat}} darted through the water. Harold, unaccustomed to judge distances, could form <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>whether</b> the distant canoes would or would not {{intercept}} them. At present both seemed to him to be running toward the shore on nearly parallel courses, and the shorter distance that the Indians would have to row seemed to place them far ahead. The courses, however, were not parallel, as the Indians were gradually turning their canoes to intercept {{the course of that}} which they were pursuing. As the minutes went by and the boats converged more and more toward the same point, Harold saw how close the race would be. After twenty minutes' hard paddling the boats were within {{a quarter of a mile}} of each other, and the courses which they were respectively taking seemed likely to bring them together at about a quarter of a mile from the shore. There were three Indian canoes, and these kept well together. So close did the race appear that Harold expected every moment to see Peter sweep the head of the canoe round and make a stern chase of it by running down the lake. This Peter had no intention of doing. The canoes, he saw, traveled as fast as his own and could each spare a man to fire occasionally, while he and his companions would be obliged to continue paddling. Better accustomed to judge distances than Harold, he was sure, at the speed at which they were going, he would be able to pass somewhat ahead of his foes.|$|E
