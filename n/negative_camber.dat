5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E

This paper proposes an experimental base research about influence of front wheel camber angle on cornering ability of 4 wheel vehicle. The experiment performed on four and two rear wheel drive of a remote control vehicle model car with variables front wheel camber angle and speed of vehicle.

2500|$|However, the car {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} the motoring press at launch due to its suspension, with positive camber on the front wheels and <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> at the rear, giving rise to the Mark III's infamous [...] "knock-kneed" [...] stance. The Mark III soon {{had a reputation for}} a harsh, unforgiving ride. In 1983 the revised suspension mounts from the Escort-based Orion and the larger Sierra steering rack were introduced as running changes for the 1984 model year which also coincided with a minor update for it including a new Escort badge at the rear.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} car changed little from the prototype, although the full-width rear bumper was dropped {{in favour of}} two part-bumpers curving round each corner, with overriders. Mechanicals were basically stock Herald with the notable addition of front disc brakes. The engine was an [...] four-cylinder with a pushrod OHV cylinder head and two valves per cylinder, mildly tuned for the Spitfire, fed by twin SU carburettors. Also from the Herald came the {{rack and pinion steering}} and coil-and-wishbone front suspension, and at the rear a single transverse-leaf swing axle arrangement. This ended up being the most controversial part of the car: it was known to [...] "tuck in" [...] and cause violent over steer if pushed too hard, even in the staid Herald. In the sportier Spitfire (and later the six-cylinder Triumph GT6 and Triumph Vitesse) it led to severe criticism. Known fixes for this include things like camber compensators (essentially a single leaf spring suspended beneath the vertical links), or simply achieving more <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> to the rear wheels can help the handling become more manageable. The body was bolted to a much-modified Herald chassis, the outer rails and the rear outriggers having been removed; little of the original Herald chassis design was left, and the Spitfire used structural outer sills to stiffen its body tub.|$|E

50|$|Camber angle {{alters the}} {{handling}} qualities {{of a particular}} suspension design; in particular, <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> improves grip when cornering. This is because it places the tire at a better angle to the road, transmitting the forces through the vertical plane of the tire rather than through a shear force across it. Another reason for <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> is that a rubber tire tends to roll on itself while cornering. The inside edge of the contact patch would begin to lift off of the ground if the tire had zero camber, reducing {{the area of the}} contact patch. This effect is compensated for by applying <b>negative</b> <b>camber,</b> maximizing the contact patch area. Note that this is only true for the outside tire during the turn; the inside tire would benefit most from positive camber.|$|E
50|$|The new car {{received}} a newly developed front axle with <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> {{and a new}} steering system incorporating paired control arms of uneven lengths.|$|E
50|$|Double {{wishbone}} suspension provides the engineer more free parameters {{than some other}} types do. It is fairly easy {{to work out the}} effect of moving each joint, so the kinematics of the suspension can be tuned easily and wheel motion can be optimized. It is also easy to work out the loads that different parts will be subjected to which allows more optimised lightweight parts to be designed. They also provide increasing <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> gain all the way to full jounce travel, unlike the MacPherson strut, which provides <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> gain only at the beginning of jounce travel and then reverses into positive camber gain at high jounce amounts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{double-wishbone}} suspension {{can also be}} referred to as [...] "double A-arms", though the arms themselves can be A-shaped, L-shaped, or even a single bar linkage. A single wishbone or A-arm can also be used in various other suspension types, such as variations of the MacPherson strut. The upper arm is usually shorter to induce [...] <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> as the suspension jounces (rises), and often this arrangement is titled an [...] "SLA" [...] or [...] "short long arms" [...] suspension. When the vehicle is in a turn, body roll results in positive camber gain on the lightly loaded inside wheel, while the heavily loaded outer wheel gains <b>negative</b> <b>camber.</b>|$|E
50|$|The three-bladed rotor {{could be}} folded for storage and transport. Three fins were fitted, two as {{endplates}} to the tail-plane, {{one half of}} which was fitted with <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> and incidence, {{in order to help}} offset the effects of the rotor.|$|E

5000|$|Torque steer, {{common in}} a front-wheel drive layout, is mitigated by greater front-wheel toe-out and specially-made lower front {{suspension}} arms that provide 1.5 degrees of <b>negative</b> <b>camber.</b> The 6" [...] x 13" [...] aluminium alloy wheels {{are intended for}} either Goodyear or Dunlop 165:13:60 section, HR-rated low-profile tyres.|$|E
50|$|Further {{improvements}} to the suspension followed with the 1500 included longer swing axles and a lowered spring mounting pointfor more <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> and a wider rear track. The wider, lower stance gave an impressive skid pad result of 0.87g average.This put the Spitfire head and shoulders over its competition in handling.|$|E
50|$|Of course {{things should}} be the same, left and right, for road cars. Camber affects {{steering}} because a tire generates a force towards the side that the top is leaning towards. This is called camber thrust. Additional front <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> is used to improve the cornering ability of cars with insufficient camber gain.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} moved from its March date to October to allow organisers the {{opportunity}} to upgrade the circuit. The circuit was resurfaced, while drainage was improved to decrease the possibility of standing water from forming on the circuit. Nine corners were re-profiled, introducing <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> to emphasise mechanical, rather than aerodynamic grip, and the drop {{at the apex of}} turn two removed.|$|E
5000|$|In Indianapolis, a curve on Interstate 70 {{westbound}} at mile marker 83.1 When opened, {{it had a}} <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> on {{the right}} shoulder, and several truckers lost control and hit the a bridge abutment, losing their lives. The stretch was closed, re-engineered with a positive bank and with rain slots along the boundary and was reopened with a 40 mph speed limit.|$|E
50|$|Some recent designs use <b>negative</b> <b>camber.</b> One such {{design is}} called the {{supercritical}} aerofoil. It is used for near-supersonic flight, and produces a higher lift to drag ratio at near supersonic flight than traditional aerofoils. Supercritical aerofoils employ a flattened upper surface, highly cambered (curved) aft section, and greater leading edge radius as compared to traditional aerofoil shapes. These changes delay the onset of wave drag.|$|E
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the car's design is the {{geometry}} of the rear axle. Two degrees of <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> on the rear de Dion axle produces a similar stabilising effect as the expensive and complex Weissach axle launched by Porsche {{a year after the}} launch of the Volvo 343. The inherent stability of this design made the car popular with caravan owners, being voted Tow Car of the Year in 1985.|$|E
50|$|V8 Supercar driver Jason Richards {{suggested}} {{that there were many}} difficult braking areas, interesting corners and good passing spots. The main straight was the single widest section of race track in Australia, while the straight along Edwin Flack Avenue was one of the narrowest. The outside of turn eight had an unusual <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> that caught many drivers out in the inaugural race, resulting in several cars crashing into the outer barriers.|$|E

50|$|The 55° {{swept wing}} {{had a slight}} <b>negative</b> <b>camber,</b> and was fitted {{with a pair of}} {{aerodynamic}} fences to prevent the spanwise flow of air away from the wing roots. The leading edge of the wing incorporated a pair of PVD leading edge slats. Flaps and ailerons were mounted on the trailing edge of the wing. The outer flaps were aligned with the trailing edge forward sweep and the inner flaps were perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the body.|$|E

Other changes included <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> front suspension geometry, with light alloy 13 inch 6J wheels; and a close ratio 5 speed gearbox and wheel arch extensions. The easiest way to distinguish this version is by the triangular holes between headlamps and grille.|$|E
50|$|Camber {{angle is}} the angle {{made by the}} wheels of a vehicle; specifically, it is the angle between the {{vertical}} axis of the wheels used for steering and the vertical axis of the vehicle when viewed from the front or rear. It {{is used in the}} design of steering and suspension. If the top of the wheel is farther out than the bottom (that is, away from the axle), it is called positive camber; if the bottom of the wheel is farther out than the top, it is called <b>negative</b> <b>camber.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In October 1959, {{ready for}} the 1960 model year, the Floride, along with the Renault Dauphine, {{appeared}} with significant suspension improvements. [...] The new suspension was conceived by the by now almost legendary automotive engineer Jean-Albert Grégoire and baptised by Renault [...] "Suspension Aérostable", being intended to improve the car's ride and road holding. [...] The addition of extra rubber springs at the front reduced roll and auxiliary air spring units (mounted inboard of the conventional coils) at the rear gave the rear wheels a small degree of <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> and increased cornering grip.|$|E
50|$|For 1992, a {{turbocharged}} 2.0 litre 16 {{valve engine}} (150 kW/204 bhp C20LET, the turbocharged {{version of the}} C20XE) {{was added to the}} range. With four wheel drive, a six speed Getrag manual transmission (F28/6) and a claimed top speed of 245 km/h (152 mph), this flagship model finally gave the Calibra the dynamics to match its looks. The Turbo model was also notable for the five stud wheel hubs and the extreme <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> (inward lean) of its rear wheels, which is apparent even from a cursory visual inspection. However, it was not a strong seller.|$|E

50|$|Pitch is {{controlled}} by the rear part of the tailplane's horizontal stabilizer being hinged to create an elevator. By moving the elevator control backwards the pilot moves the elevator up (a position of <b>negative</b> <b>camber)</b> and the downwards force on the horizontal tail is increased. The angle of attack on the wings increased so the nose is pitched up and lift is generally increased. In micro-lights and hang gliders the pitch action is reversed - the pitch control system is much simpler so when the pilot moves the elevator control backwards it produces a nose-down pitch and the angle of attack on the wing is reduced.|$|E
50|$|Cars {{associated}} with VIP style usually have common characteristics, {{such as high}} end wheels with excessive amounts of dish. (usually broad faced designs) with low offsets that sit flush with the fender, exhausts that stick out past the rear bumper (although not so much emphasized these days), a full bodykit or lip kit, glossy paint and a lowered ride height. It {{is not uncommon to}} see extremely <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> on many VIP style cars. Traditional colors of VIP Style cars are usually black, white, grey and silver. The appearance of these vehicles is regarded in Japan as conspicuous and attention-seeking, as owning this type of vehicle is expensive, with regards to the annual road tax obligation.|$|E
50|$|When a {{wheel is}} set up to have some camber angle, the {{interaction}} between the tire and road surface causes the wheel to tend to want to roll in a curve, as if it were part of a conical surface (camber thrust). This tendency to turn increases the rolling resistance as well as increasing tire wear. A small degree of toe (toe-out for <b>negative</b> <b>camber,</b> toe-in for positive camber) will cancel this turning tendency, reducing wear and rolling resistance. On some competition vehicles such as go-karts, especially where power is extremely limited and is highly regulated by the rules of the sport, these effects can become very significant in terms of competitiveness and performance.Toe-in and toe-out give the steering stability.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{performance}} upgrades {{were available for}} Vitesses, during and after production. Many were provided by SAH Accessories, later owned by Dunham and Haines in Dunstable, north of London. The [...] "Tite-a-turn" [...] modification {{was an attempt to}} tame the early swing axle suspension by increasing the resistance to suspension extension on the inside rear wheel (and the transition into positive camber) while allowing normal compression into <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> on the outer wheel. Engine modifications went from simple cosmetics like an alloy rocker cover to more serious changes. Alloy manifolds for triple twin-choke Weber or Dellorto carburetors were available and gave considerable improvements in acceleration and top speed especially if coupled with SAH's tubular exhaust manifolds (2x3 into 1, then 2 into 1), straight through rear box/twin boxes and camshaft changes.|$|E
50|$|A {{range of}} {{disabled}} sports {{have been developed}} for disabled athletes, including basketball, rugby, tennis, racing and dancing. The wheelchairs used for each sport have evolved to suit the specific needs of that sport and often no longer resemble their everyday cousins. They are usually non-folding (in order to increase rigidity), with a pronounced <b>negative</b> <b>camber</b> for the wheels (which provides stability and is helpful for making sharp turns), and often are made of composite, lightweight materials. Even seating position may be radically different, with racing wheelchairs generally used in a kneeling position. Sport wheelchairs are rarely suited for everyday use, and are often a 'second' chair specifically for sport use, although some users prefer the sport options for everyday. Some disabled people, for instance lower-limb amputees, may use a wheelchair for sports, but not for everyday activities.|$|E
