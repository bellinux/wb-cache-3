40|$|This is {{the final}} report for the {{actuator}} bracket/lug fracture mechanics qualification test. The test plan (CTP- 0071) outlined a two-phase test program designed {{to answer questions about}} the fracture criticality of the redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM) <b>nozzle</b> <b>actuator</b> bracket. An analysis conducted using the NASA/FLAGRO fracture mechanics computer program indicated that the actuator bracket might be a fracture critical component. In the NASA/FLAGRO analysis, a simple lug model was used to represent the actuator bracket. It was calculated that the bracket would fracture if subjected to an actuator stall load {{in the presence of a}} 0. 10 in. corner crack at the actuator attachment hole. The 0. 10 in. crack size corresponds to the nondestructive inspection detectability limit for the actuator bracket. The inspection method used is the dye penetrant method. The actuator stall load (103, 424 lb) is the maximum load which the actuator bracket is required to withstand during motor operation. This testing was designed to establish the accuracy of the analytical model and to directly determine whether the actuator bracket is capable of meeting fracture mechanics safe-life requirements...|$|E
40|$|Stringent {{reliability}} and maintainability requirements for modern complex systems demand {{the development of}} systematic methods for fault detection and isolation. Many of such complex systems can be modeled as hybrid automata. In this thesis, a novel framework for fault diagnosis of hybrid automata is presented. Generally, in a hybrid system, two types of sensors may be available, namely: continuous sensors supplying continuous-time readings (i. e., real numbers) and threshold sensitive (discrete) sensors supplying discrete outputs (e. g., level high and pressure low). It is assumed that a bank of residual generators (detection filters) designed based on the continuous model of the plant is available. In the proposed framework, each residual generator is modeled by a Discrete-Event System (DES). Then, these DES models are integrated with the DES model of the hybrid system to build an Extended DES model. A "hybrid" diagnoser is then constructed based on the extended DES model. The "hybrid" diagnoser effectively combines the readings of discrete sensors and the information supplied by residual generators (which is based on continuous sensors) to determine the health status of the hybrid system. The problem of diagnosability of failure modes in hybrid automata is also studied here. A notion of failure diagnosability in hybrid automata is introduced and it is shown that for the diagnosability of a failure mode in a hybrid automaton, it is sufficient that the failure mode be diagnosable in the extended DES model developed for representing the hybrid automaton and residual generators. The diagnosability of failure modes in the case that some residual generators produce unreliable outputs {{in the form of}} false alarm or false silence signals is also investigated. Moreover, the problem of isolator (residual generator) selection is examined and approaches are developed for computing a minimal set of isolators to ensure the diagnosability of failure modes. The proposed hybrid diagnosis approach is employed for investigating faults in the fuel supply system and the <b>nozzle</b> <b>actuator</b> of a single-spool turbojet engine with an afterburner. A hybrid automaton model is obtained for the engine. A bank of residual generators is also designed, and an extended DES is constructed for the engine. Based on the extended DES model, a hybrid diagnoser is constructed and developed. The faults diagnosable by a purely DES diagnoser or by methods based on residual generators alone are also diagnosable by the hybrid diagnoser. Moreover, we have shown that there are faults (or groups of faults) in the fuel supply system and the <b>nozzle</b> <b>actuator</b> that can be isolated neither by a purely DES diagnoser nor by methods based on residual generators alone. However, these faults (or groups of faults) can be isolated if the hybrid diagnoser is used...|$|E

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer at [URL] {{aim of this study}} is to investigate aerosol plume geometries of pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) using a high-speed laser image system with different <b>actuator</b> <b>nozzle</b> materials and designs. Actuators made from aluminium, PET and PTFE were manufactured with four different nozzle designs: cone, flat, curved cone and curved flat. Plume angles and spans generated using the designed <b>actuator</b> <b>nozzles</b> with four solution-based pMDI formulations were imaged using Oxford Lasers EnVision system and analysed using EnVision Patternate software. Reduced plume angles for all <b>actuator</b> materials and <b>nozzle</b> designs were observed with pMDI formulations containing drug with high co-solvent concentration (ethanol) due to the reduced vapour pressure. Significantly higher plume angles were observed with the PTFE flat nozzle across all formulations, which could be a result of the nozzle geometry and material’s hydrophobicity. The plume geometry of pMDI aerosols can be influenced by the vapour pressure of the formulation, <b>nozzle</b> geometries and <b>actuator</b> material physiochemical properties...|$|R

40|$|Longitudinal spray {{distribution}} is mainly {{affected by the}} horizontal speed variations of the nozzles. Manufacturers classically try to reduce unwanted nozzles movements using horizontal boom suspension but these methods have performance and price limitations. This paper describes a spray controller aiming to compensate {{the effect of the}} horizontal boom movements on the spray deposits homogeneity. The controller is based on three main components: a control law describing the relationship between nozzle speed, nozzle flow and spray deposit; a real time measurement of the boom horizontal speed variations using micro-machined capacitive accelerometers, and pulse width modulation (PWM) <b>nozzle</b> flow <b>actuators.</b> To assess the feasibility of such a controller, a single nozzle prototype was developed and tested in the laboratory, using a nigrosine solution. Spray coverage was measured using image analysis for field representative nozzle speed variations. The spray coverage uniformity using the controller showed about 51 % compensation of the variations observed without it. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

50|$|The first Boeing YC-14 (serial number 72-1873) flew on 9 August 1976. Two {{aircraft}} were built, {{the second}} being s/n 72-1874. The competing YC-15 had started flights {{almost a year}} earlier. Head-to-head flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base started in early November 1976. During flight testing, the YC-14 was flown at speeds as low as 59 kn and as high as M=.78 at 38000 ft. However, {{it was found that}} the YC-14's drag was 11% higher than originally predicted. Modifications developed in wind tunnel testing, comprising the addition of vortex generators to the upper aft portion of the nacelles, deletion of the <b>nozzle</b> door <b>actuator</b> fairing, alterations to the aft end of the landing gear pods and the addition of aft fuselage strakes, reduced this drag decrement to 7%.

50|$|Modern aerosol spray {{products}} have three major parts: the can, the valve and the actuator or button. The can is most commonly lacquered tinplate (steel {{with a layer}} of tin) and may be made of two or three pieces of metal crimped together. Aluminium cans are also common and are generally used for more expensive products. The valve is crimped to the rim of the can, and the design of this component is important in determining the spray rate. The actuator is depressed by the user to open the valve; a spring closes the valve again when it is released. The shape and size of the <b>nozzle</b> in the <b>actuator</b> controls the spread of the aerosol spray.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to find an optimal nozzle size of an {{axisymmetric}} synthetic jet actuator based on a loudspeaker. The desirable maximized output quantities are: volumetric flow, momentum flux, and kinetic energy flux. To evaluate these quantities velocity profiles were measured using a hot-wire probe at the <b>actuator</b> <b>nozzle</b> exit. Six different nozzle diameters and three supplied real power levels were tested to find the maxima of the quantities. The actuator operated always at resonance during experiments. It was found out that the momentum flux and the kinetic energy flux reach distinguishable local maxima at particular diameters of the nozzle. Besides, the maxima of the particular quantities do not coincide and the best nozzle size slightly increases with the supplied real power to the actuator...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the fundamental elements that influence aerosol electrostatic charge and performance of pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDI). This was achieved by focusing on both physical and chemical parameters of the pMDI system, including orifice materials, geometries and formulation parameters. The electrostatic charges generated from pMDIs were successfully quantified using a modified Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI) and the magnitude and polarity of aerosol charges were found to be dependent on the <b>actuator</b> materials, <b>nozzle</b> geometries and the formulation used. Triboelectric charging trend was observed with different actuator materials selected from the triboelectric series, when using cone <b>nozzle</b> geometry <b>actuators</b> with drug free and low co-solvent pMDI formulations, respectively. Reversed charge polarities with higher throat deposition were observed with thermoplastic <b>actuators,</b> when curved <b>nozzle</b> geometries were used. The active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) dominated the charge profiles of pMDI formulations over <b>actuator</b> materials and <b>nozzle</b> designs. The studies presented in this thesis have provided valuable information with regards to the relationships between device/formulation parameters (<b>actuator</b> material, <b>nozzle</b> geometries and API) and aerosol electrostatic charge profiles generated from pMDI systems, hence provided fundamental knowledge for the future development of pMDIs and novel electrostatic spray systems.

5000|$|Instant action {{systems are}} mainly aerosol sprays, or atomizers. The aerosol spray uses a {{propellant}} and fragrance packaged under pressure {{in a sealed}} metal or glass container with a valve which is opened by pressing down a button which contains a spray <b>nozzle</b> - the <b>actuator.</b> When the container's valve is opened by pressing the actuator, fragrance is forced through the spray nozzle located inside the actuator to create a mist of droplets containing fragrance. These droplets are 30 to 50 micrometres in diameter. The atomizer is a glass, metal or plastic container of fragrance which operates {{in a similar fashion}} except that the actuator is a pump which when pressed a few times creates the pressure to aspirate the fragrance from the container through a tube into the <b>actuator</b> and spray <b>nozzle.</b> The mist created contains droplets 50 to 150 micrometres in diameter. A recently developed type of aerosol packages a plastic bag of fragrance into a can. The bag is attached to the valve/actuator/spray nozzle and sealed in the can surrounded by air under pressure. When the actuator is pressed, the valve opens and the liquid forced through the nozzle by the pressure around the bag. This is called [...] "bag-on-valve" [...] technology.|$|R
40|$|NASA astronauts plan {{to return}} to the Moon as early as 2015 and {{establish}} a lunar base, from which 6 -month flights to Mars would be launched by 2030. Essential to this plan is the Ares launch vehicle, NASA s next-generation spacecraft that will, in various iterations, be responsible for transporting all equipment and personnel to the Moon, Mars, and beyond for the foreseeable future. The Ares launch vehicle is powered by the J- 2 X propulsion system, with what will be the world s largest rocket nozzles. One of the conditions that engineers carefully consider in designing rocket nozzles particularly large ones is called separation phenomenon, which occurs when outside ambient air is sucked into the nozzle rim by the relatively low pressures of rapidly expanding exhaust gasses. This separation of exhaust gasses from the side-wall imparts large asymmetric transverse loads on the nozzle, deforming the shape and thus perturbing exhaust flow to cause even greater separation. The resulting interaction can potentially crack the <b>nozzle</b> or break <b>actuator</b> arms that control thrust direction. Side-wall loads are extremely difficult to measure directly, and, until now, techniques were not available for accurately predicting the magnitude and frequency of the loads. NASA researchers studied separation phenomenon in scale-model rocket nozzles, seeking to use measured vibration on these nozzle replicas to calculate the unknown force causing the vibrations. Key to this approach was the creation of a computer model accurately representing the nozzle as well as the test cell...|$|R
40|$|Supersonic {{jet noise}} {{reduction}} {{is important for}} high speed military aircraft. Lower acoustic levels would reduce structural fatigue leading to longer lifetime of the jet aircraft. It is not solely structural aspects which are of importance, health issues of the pilot and the airfield per- sonnel are also very important, as high acoustic levels may result in severe hearing damage. It remains a major challenge to reduce the overall noise levels of the aircraft, where the supersonic exhaust is the main noise source for near ground operation. Fluidic injection into the supersonic jet at the nozzle exhaust has been shown as a promising method for noise reduction. It {{has been shown to}} speed up the mix- ing process of the main jet, hence reducing the kinetic energy level of the jet {{and the power of the}} total acoustic radiation. Furthermore, the interaction mechanism between the fluidic injection and the shock structure in the jet exhaust plays a crucial role in the total noise radia- tion. In this study, LES is used to investigate the change in flow struc- tures of a supersonic (M= 1. 56) jet from a converging-diverging <b>nozzle.</b> Six fluidic <b>actuators,</b> evenly distributed around the nozzle exit, inject air in a radial direction towards the main flow axis with a total mass flow ratio of 3 %. Steady injection is compared with flapping injection. With flapping injection turned on, the injection angle of each injector is varied sinusoidally in the nozzle exit plane and the variation is the same for all injectors.

40|$|The {{development}} of a micro-electro-kinetic-actuator (MEKA) array for the study {{and control of the}} viscous sublayer of a turbulent boundary layer is presented. Several generations of such MEKA arrays have been fabricated that explore the use of non-conventional MEMS materials such as quartz, polymers or mylar and are combined where needed with conventional MEMS design and fabrication processes. The present study is the first attempt to exploit the potential advantages of using the electrokinetic principle as the basis for a new class of microscale actuators suitable for active sublayer control. Among such advantages are that these actuators have no moving parts, and that they achieve the flow rates required for this type of flow control. Moreover, the inherent problem of matching the length and time scales between microactuators and the physical system being controlled makes the viscous sublayer a natural choice for these types of actuators. The electrokinetic drivers are fabricated inside microchannels, 250 mm to 2 mm in diameter, using a liquid-phase polymerization process that generates 1 µm doped pores. This process greatly simplifies the fabrication {{of a large number of}} actuators, and using this technique we are able to fill 100 % of the 25 [*] 600 microchannels that form the typical MEKA 5 array. The array is fabricated using a novel three-layer design that contains (i) a top layer with the <b>actuator</b> <b>nozzles,</b> electrodes and leadouts, (ii) a center layer containing the individually addressable electrokinetic driver channels in which electrolyte pumping occurs in response to a time-varying electric field that will induce volume displacement in the sublayer and (iii) a bottom layer containing an electrolyte reservoir and common electrode.

40|$|Turbulent mixing {{enhancement}} {{has received}} {{a great deal of}} attention in the fluid mechanics community in the last few decades. Generally speaking, mixing enhancement involves the increased dispersion of the fluid that makes up a flow. The current work focuses on mixing enhancement of an axisymmetric jet via high amplitude fluidic pulses applied at the nozzle exit with high aspect ratio <b>actuator</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The work consists of small scale clean jet experiments, small scale micro-turbine engine experiments, and full scale laboratory simulated core exhaust experiments using actuators designed to fit within the engine nacelle of a full scale aircraft. The small scale clean jet experiments show that mixing enhancement compared to the unforced case is likely due to a combination of mechanisms. The first mechanism is the growth of shear layer instabilities, similar to that which occurs with an acoustically excited jet except that, in this case, the forcing is highly nonlinear. The result of the instability is a frequency bucket with an optimal forcing frequency. The second mechanism is the generation of counter rotating vortex pairs similar to those generated by mechanical tabs. The penetration depth determines the extent to which this mechanism acts. The importance of this mechanism is therefore a function of the pulsing amplitude. The key mixing parameters were found to be the actuator to jet momentum ratio (amplitude) and the pulsing frequency, where the optimal frequency depends on the amplitude. The importance of phase, offset, duty cycle, and geometric configuration were also explored. The experiments on the jet engine and full scale simulated core nozzle demonstrated that pulse fluidic mixing enhancement was effective on realistic flows. The same parameters that were important for the cleaner small scale experiments were found to be important for the more realistic cases as well. This suggests that the same mixing mechanisms are at work. Additional work was done to optimize, in real time, mixing on the small jet engine using an evolution strategy. Ph. D.

40|$|With the {{background}} of health issues regarding the consumption of tobacco, the widespread availability of safer nicotine products and a harm reduction policy is encouraged. A cigarette alternative is designed to deliver a dose of medicinal nicotine within a timeframe {{comparable to that of}} a cigarette, and gives much of what smokers expect from a cigarette without the risks of smoking tobacco. The general purpose of this Ph. D. project is to study the process of flashing atomization and dispersion, with a view to supporting the development of a cigarette replacement device. In order to test the effectiveness of the nicotine formulations, the analysis is carried out sizing the droplets of the aerosols at the position where human oropharynx locates, to support the further research on the deposition of droplets in the human respiratory tract. A mechanical lung has been assembled and programmed to trigger the ‘cigarette-like’ devices with different inhalation profiles, and a dual laser system has been designed to measure the global actuation flow characteristics (e. g. spray velocity and opacity). In order to efficiently acquire sufficient droplet information (e. g. diameter and aspect ratio) from images of in and out of focus droplets, a multi-threshold algorithm is developed and successfully implemented in the automatic particle/droplet image analysis (PDIA) system. It increases the depth of field (DoF) of small particles with diameters smaller than 50 ?m, and it performs more efficiently than the dual threshold methods which are widely used in the commercial software. A numerical multi-component two-phase actuation flow model has been developed, in order to test different formulations within various flow domains of the cigarette replacement devices. The simulated results of the numerical model have been validated with the experimental measurements and the results of previous researchers. In order to acquire an aerosol with relatively low and steady mass flow rate of nicotine, it is recommended that the mass fraction of propellant (HFA 134 a) should be kept around 75 %~ 90 % to avoid the sharp temperature drop causing the sensation of freezing. The <b>actuator</b> <b>nozzle</b> diameter should be 0. 2 mm~ 0. 3 mm to produce a flow with relatively low mass flow rate. Furthermore the numerical model is capable of predicting the residual mass median diameter (MMD) of the spray, by using evaporation model of multicomponent liquid droplets, to quantify the sprays. Two different formulations with 95 % and 98 % mass fraction of HFA 134 a, and two prototype cigarette alternatives with different expansion chamber volumes, have been analyzed by the numerical model and compared with the dual laser measurements. In addition, it considers the spray character by high speed imaging, with the special interest in the flashing phenomena and droplet sizes. It concludes that a larger expansion chamber volume enhances the propellant evaporation, recirculation, bubble generation and growth inside the chamber, and it made a significant improvement to produce finer sprays. Although the formulation with 98 % of HFA 134 a can generate smaller droplets, the formulation with 95 % of HFA 134 a produces more steady puffs with relatively low mass flow rate...|$|R
