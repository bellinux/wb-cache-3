5|$|During the negotiations, the {{relatives}} {{of several of the}} West Side Boys were brought to the gang's camp to ask them to release the British soldiers. The gang responded that they had <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> the soldiers, but that holding them had brought attention to their demands—which now included immunity from prosecution, safe passage to the UK to take up university courses, and guaranteed acceptance to the re-formed Sierra Leone Army.|$|E
5|$|If we were {{to regard}} Sirius and Procyon as double stars, the change of their motions would not {{surprise}} us; we should acknowledge them as necessary, and have only to investigate their amount by observation. But light is no real property of mass. The existence of numberless visible stars can prove <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> the existence of numberless invisible ones.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E

5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center {{to get in touch}} over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> the State experts.|$|E
25|$|Let us {{remember}} that we form a government for millions not yet in existence.... In the course {{of four or five}} hundred years, I do not know how it will work. This is most certain, that Papists may occupy that chair, and Mahometans may take it. I see <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> it.|$|E
25|$|Desamatha faced {{problems}} after sometime {{due to the}} {{new rule}} by the British that <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> British should be published. The British used to monitor the magazine and its subscriptions. But Chilakamarti {{did not like the}} magazine to be a subsidised paper. He thought that running the magazine according to the rules of British is equivalent to the selling of one's own soul.|$|E

25|$|The Russians and the Japanese both contributed {{troops to}} the eight-member {{international}} force sent in 1900 to quell the Boxer Rebellion and to relieve the international legations under siege in the Chinese capital, Beijing. Russia had already sent 177,000 soldiers to Manchuria, nominally to protect its railways under construction. The troops of the Qing Empire and the participants of the Boxer Rebellion could do <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> such a massive army and were ejected from Manchuria. After the Boxer Rebellion, 100,000 Russian soldiers were stationed in Manchuria. The Russian troops settled in and despite assurances they would vacate the area after the crisis, by 1903 the Russians had not established a timetable for withdrawal and had actually strengthened their position in Manchuria.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the three}} Pisa-class armored cruisers were {{originally}} built for the Regia Marina. The third ship was built on speculation and was sold to Greece and completed as Georgios Averof, named after a wealthy Greek businessman who had left a sizeable legacy for the increase of the Greek Navy in his will. The ship participated in the Coronation Fleet Review for King George V of the United Kingdom in 1911 shortly after commissioning. She served in the Balkan Wars and {{was instrumental in the}} Greek victories over the Ottoman Empire in the Battles of Elli and Lemnos during the First Balkan War. During World War I, Georgios Averof did not see much active service, as Greece was neutral during {{the first years of the}} war. After the Noemvriana riots of 1916, she was seized by the French to ensure that she could do <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> the Entente. After the war's end, the ship participated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–22 and helped in the evacuation of the refugees after the Greek Army's defeat. In 1925–27 Georgios Averof was reconstructed in France and rearmed.|$|E
500|$|The character's {{reception}} {{has been}} mixed. Upon DeGarmo joining the show, Luke Kerr of Zap2It was not receptive of the character's concept. He compared her to Snooki {{of the reality}} television series Jersey Shore {{and said that the}} show has fallen under Jersey Shores [...] "drunken spell". He wrote: [...] "Regardless of who portrayed the character—because I have absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> DeGarmo—why does Y need yet another big name stunt cast?" [...] Additionally, he said: [...] "every time I read something about the new character I find myself asking myself why, just why?" [...] DeGarmo said: [...] "Angelina nor I need to watch ‘Jersey Shore’ for pointers. But we are fans. Definitely Snooki is someone we look up to." ...|$|E

I need not say that I heard <b>nothing</b> whatever <b>against</b> him; {{but there was a}} sort of consensus of opinion that it was a pity that he had not some pursuit or occupation. As you know, he mixed himself up to some extent with smugglers, he spent his evenings frequently in billiard-rooms, and altogether, though there was <b>nothing</b> absolutely <b>against</b> him, {{it was clear that he}} was doing himself no good." ...|$|R

500|$|Masked {{protesters in}} Seattle, Washington, United States congregated {{in front of}} the Church of Scientology of Washington. Protesters were quoted as saying, [...] "We believe in total freedom of belief. We have <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> the people of Scientology, however the Church of Scientology has {{committed}} crimes. They're vehemently anti-opposition. Anyone who opposes them, must go down." [...] A protester in Santa Barbara emphasized that their opposition was against the organization, not the belief system, and that they supported the Scientology split-off group known as the Free Zone. Protesters turned out in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania despite unusually cold weather. The masked crowd consisted mainly of college students, including some who had travelled from as far as Penn State University.|$|E
500|$|During {{his musical}} career, Pulido's fans {{questioned}} his sexuality; {{he said he}} is not homosexual but rumors that he had slept with men continue to circulate. Pulido spoke to a Mexican television news program in 2013, and told viewers he is heterosexual and that he has gay fans, which he said did not concern him. In April 2010, media outlets questioned Pulido after he released a music video in which he plays a stereotypical gay male; the singer said he wanted to [...] "try something different [...] " [...] and defended his gay followers, saying he <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> the LGBT community. After American Latin pop singer Ricky Martin publicly announced his homosexuality, Pulido defended Martin's choice, saying [...] "he is living his dreams".|$|E
500|$|Following the competition, former {{national}} team captain Lilian Thuram stated that Evra {{should be banned}} permanently from playing for the national team. His sentiments were later echoed by Sports Minister Chantal Jouanno, who declared, [...] "I have <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> Evra but, as a France player and especially captain, he did not defend the values of sport which are shared by the Republic. I am sure there exist other talents who have not sullied France and {{are waiting for the}} chance to write new history". On 6 August, Evra was one of five players summoned to attend a hearing held by the Disciplinary Committee of the FFF in response to the team's strike at the World Cup. On 17 August, he received a five-match international ban for his part in the incident.|$|E

500|$|In a November 2013 {{interview}} with Q, Lorde expressed frustration about [...] "certain things about music": [...] "There {{are a lot}} of shock tactics these days. People trying to outdo each other, which will probably culminate in two people fucking on stage at the Grammys." [...] Following the release of Pure Heroine, she also described herself as a [...] "sex-positive" [...] person, elaborating:People like to paint me in a certain way, but I'm a hugely sex-positive person and I have <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> anyone getting naked. For me personally I just don't think it really would complement my music in any way or help me tell a story any better. It's not like I have a problem with dancing around in undies—I think you can use that stuff in a hugely powerful way. It just hasn't felt necessary for me.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{the songs}} from the album explore social issues. The songs [...] "I Wanna Be Your Lush" [...] and [...] "Too Famous" [...] use satire to criticise the {{superior}} attitudes of male musicians, while [...] "Husband" [...] disapproves [...] "gruff and pushy" [...] boyfriends. The band also clarified that they have <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> men. As Rootes notes, [...] "Men are great! We love them! We're talking about dickhead men, not all men." [...] The band considered themselves more of a pro-girl band than a feminist band. Rootes told Select: [...] "So many girls are afraid to be girls. Apart from Courtney Love, who's really feminine and uses her sexuality and is a strong woman. I don't think women should dress like boys. That's what's great about PJ Harvey. She was boyish and now she's gone really glam. She looks amazing and she's become an icon: a real woman." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1889 it was {{reported}} that the Prince and Princess of Wales were [...] "daily assailed with anonymous letters of the most outrageous character" [...] bearing upon the scandal. The Prince of Wales intervened in the investigation; no clients were ever prosecuted and <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> Albert Victor was proven. Sir Charles Russell was retained to watch the proceedings in the case on behalf of Albert Victor. Although there is no conclusive evidence for or against his involvement, or that he ever visited a homosexual club or brothel, the rumours and cover-up have led some biographers to speculate that he did visit Cleveland Street, and that he was [...] "possibly bisexual, probably homosexual". This is contested by other commentators, one of whom refers to him as [...] "ardently heterosexual" [...] and his involvement in the rumours as [...] "somewhat unfair". The historian H. Montgomery Hyde wrote, [...] "There is no evidence that he was homosexual, or even bisexual." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{reflected}} that, after all, {{this young}} man had <b>nothing</b> overt <b>against</b> him, beyond a fishy blue eye and an inane expression; so, feeling that I had perhaps gone a little too far, I continued after a minute, 'And your uncle, how is he?' ...|$|R

500|$|When {{asked why}} he was {{compelled}} to revisit the Velázquez so often, Bacon replied that he had <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> popes per se, but merely sought [...] "an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting {{into a sort of}} false fauve manner." [...] Schmied sees HeadVI as a reaction against Velázquez, and a commentary on how the papacy is [...] "obsolete and decayed", with a pope resistant to both modernisation and secularisation. To him, the figure seems to [...] "resist the maltreatment of image and tries to halt the impending collapse of the established work order. He screams and grimaces, clutching at arms of his throne." [...] Sylvester notes that Bacon was impressed by Picasso's figuration and handling of paint, especially in Picasso's 1930s works; and suggests that the white blobs around the pope's cape may be influenced by the 1913 Woman in a Slip Seated in an Armchair.|$|E
500|$|California State Senator John Briggs saw an {{opportunity}} in the Christian fundamentalists' campaign. He was hoping to be elected governor of California in 1978, and {{was impressed with the}} voter turnout he saw in Miami. When Briggs returned to Sacramento, he wrote a bill that would ban gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools throughout California. Briggs claimed in private that he had <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> gays, telling gay journalist Randy Shilts, [...] "It's politics. Just politics." [...] Random attacks on gays rose in the Castro. When the police response was considered inadequate, groups of gays patrolled the neighborhood themselves, on alert for attackers. On June 21, 1977, a gay man named Robert Hillsborough died from 15 stab wounds while his attackers gathered around him and chanted [...] "Faggot!" [...] Both Mayor Moscone and Hillsborough's mother blamed Anita Bryant and John Briggs. One week prior to the incident, Briggs had held a press conference at San Francisco City Hall where he called the city a [...] "sexual garbage heap" [...] because of homosexuals. Weeks later, 250,000people attended the 1977 San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade, the largest attendance at any Gay Pride event to that point.|$|E
500|$|The Canadian Corps {{remained}} in the Ypres Salient in a stationary yet aggressive status {{until the beginning of}} September when the corps was transferred to the Somme. In the aftermath of the battle and {{in the wake of the}} death of Major-General M.S. Mercer, Canadian Corps commander Julian Byng was forced to address the politically sensitive topic of appointing a new 3rd Canadian Division commander. Canadian Minister of Militia and Defence Sam Hughes telegraphed Byng and insisted that his son, 1st Canadian Brigade commander Brigadier-General Garnet Hughes, be given command of the 3rd Canadian Division. To the fury of the minister, Byng instead promoted 2nd Canadian Brigade commander Brigadier-General Louis Lipsett, a highly regarded pre-war British regular, to the post. The minister protested and confronted Byng in August 1916 but he did not relent, insisting that [...] "he had <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> Garnet Hughes there was simply a better man for the post". The change in command between Lieutenant-General Edwin Alderson and Julian Byng was also used as an opportunity to make additional changes. Much to the displeasure of Minister Hughes and delight of the Canadian troops, the unreliable Canadian Ross Rifle began to be replaced with the British Lee–Enfield and the Colt machine gun with the Vickers and Lewis machine guns.|$|E
