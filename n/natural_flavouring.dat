Under our experimental conditions, the monoterpene showed to induce both point mutations (i. e. frameshift, base-substitution and/or oxidative damage) and DNA damage (i. e. clastogenic or aneuploidic damage, or single-strand breaks). Computational prediction for piperitenone oxide agreed with the toxicological data, and highlighted {{the presence of the}} epoxide function and the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl as possible structural alerts for DNA damage. However, improving the toxicological libraries for natural occurring compounds is required in order to favour the applicability of in silico models to the toxicological predictions. Further in vivo evaluations are strictly needed in order to evaluate the role of the bioavailability of the substance and the metabolic fate on its genotoxicity profile. To the best of our knowledge, these data represent the first evaluation of the genotoxicity for this flavour compound and suggest the need of further studies to assess the safety of piperitenone oxide as either flavour or fragrance chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Saffron (Crocus sativus) is {{the most}} {{valuable}} and indigenous crop in Iran. The stigmas of flower are used as a popular <b>natural</b> <b>flavouring,</b> colouring and medicinal agent. However, the market suffers from frauds in this plant such as mixing with safflower petals due to high profit. Identification of these frauds with conventional and biochemical methods is difficult and low sensitive. Therefore, application of molecular markers such as random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) /sequence characterized amplified regions (SCAR) is being considered as an alternative. In this study, DNA was extracted from dry stigmas of 5 Saffron accessions and dry petals of 7 safflower cultivars. RAPD reactions with ten 15 -mer random primers resulted in two specific monomorphic bands (500 and 700 bp) for safflower, while they were absent in saffron accessions. PCR analysis with specific SCAR primers amplified two specific bands (414 and 589 bp) for safflowers in different combinations of saffron stigmas and safflower petals. This {{was the case with}} very low rates or 1 % of safflower. Therefore, this method seems to be suitable for fraud identification of safflower petals in commercial saffron samples...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{major developments}} in the safety evaluation of chemical mixtures during the past 15 years, reviews today's {{state of the art}} of mixture toxicology, and discusses challenges ahead. Well-thought-out tailor-made mechanistic and empirical designs for studying the toxicity of mixtures have gradually substituted trial-and-error approaches, improving the insight into the testability of joint action and interaction of constituents of mixtures. The acquired knowledge has successfully been used to evaluate the safety of combined exposures and complex mixtures such as, for example, the atmosphere at hazardous waste sites, drinking water disinfection by-products, <b>natural</b> <b>flavouring</b> complexes, and the combined intake of food additives. To consolidate the scientific foundation of mixture toxicology, studies are in progress to revisit the biological concepts and mathematics underlying formulas for low-dose extrapolation and risk assessment of chemical mixtures. Conspicuous developments include the production of new computer programs applicable to mixture research (CombiTool, BioMol, Reaction Network Modelling), the application of functional genomics and proteomics to mixture studies, the use of nano-optochemical sensors for in vivo imaging of physiological processes in cells, and the application of optical sensor micro- and nano-arrays for complex sample analysis. Clearly, the input of theoretical biologists, biomathematicians and bioengineers in mixture toxicology is essential for the development of this challenging branch of toxicology into a scientific subdiscipline of full value. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Flavouring {{agents have}} been used {{worldwide}} in food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. Most of the flavouring agents used are synthetically produced which at times lack the natural taste of the material. This study aimed to study the usage of tropical fruits as <b>natural</b> <b>flavouring</b> agents and the best mechanism and solvent system {{that are able to}} extract the best quality of flavouring agent. The tropical fruit chosen in this study is A. heterophyllus L. or commonly known as jackfruit. Three solvent systems (50 %, 70 % and 90 % ethanol) and two processing mechanisms (blended and whole fruit flesh) are studied in this research. The utilization of jackfruit waste (perigones) is also studied. The total phenolic content (TPC) of each extract was measured and the samples with the highest and lowest TPC content was evaluated using trained panelists. The results of the study showed that the sample extracted using solvent system with the highest polarity and blended mechanism (50 % EtOH Blended) contains the highest concentration of phenols while the lowest TPC was measured in 90 % EtOH whole jackfruit flesh. The perigones of the jackfruit also showed a significant amount of phenols which can be further utilized. The results of the sensory evaluation showed {{no significant difference between the}} sample with the highest and lowest TPC. This shows that for the production of flavouring agent from A. heterophyllus L. blending is not required to produce a flavouring agent that is acceptable by consumers which will reduce the cost of production...|$|E
40|$|In 2013, Stiftung Warentest tested {{hazelnut}} chocolate {{for their}} leading magazine, called Test. Stiftung Warentest {{is one of}} the most important consumer organizations in Germany. Ritter Sport is a high-quality producer of chocolate in Germany. Their hazelnut chocolate did not pass the test. It was given the grade of unsatisfactory. Stiftung Warentest accused Ritter Sport of labelling an artificial flavouring as a <b>natural</b> <b>flavouring.</b> Ritter Sport rejected the accusation. They went to court and won the trial. Stiftung Warentest had to withdraw the issue in question of Test magazine. This affair was all over the media in January of 2014. Using the Ritter Sport versus Stiftung Warentest case, we analyse whether negative headlines really undermine the credibility of a quality label by examining Stiftung Warentest and their quality label, also called Test. In addition, we examine what can be done to restore or, more generally, increase the credibility of a quality label. Based on a quasi-natural experiment, we find that the negative headlines on Stiftung Warentest have undermined the credibility of the Test label. We also find that the credibility of the Test label can be increased by providing reference values to the tests, strengthening the independence of Stiftung Warentest, and using laboratory methods in the tests. For the most part, the same holds true for any quality label. Im Jahr 2013 testete Stiftung Warentest Nuss-Schokoladen f das Dezember-Heft ihrer Test- Zeitschrift.
