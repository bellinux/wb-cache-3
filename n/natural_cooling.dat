5|$|Since the opening, {{the venue}} has hosted Gjøvik Hockey, {{which started in}} 1993 in the Fourth Division. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall hosted 16 ice hockey matches between 12 and 26 February, {{including}} two quarter-finals and one semi-final. The remaining matches were played at the larger Håkons Hall in Lillehammer. In March 1995, the operator announced that the ice would remain throughout the year. Because of the <b>natural</b> <b>cooling</b> of the mountain, the operator saved 1,000 kilowatts in heating costs by reusing the cooling system to heat {{the rest of the}} cavern hall. On 4 April 1995, the venue was used to host an international match between Norway and Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the {{dominant}} process of layering is fractional crystallisation, layering can also {{result in a}} magma body through assimilation of the wall rocks. This will tend to increase the silica content of the melt, which will eventually prompt a mineral to reach the liquidus for that magma composition. Note also that assimilation of wall rocks takes considerable thermal energy, so this process {{goes hand in hand}} with the <b>natural</b> <b>cooling</b> of the magma body. Often, assimilation can only be proven by detailed geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|The Griffins {{assigned}} spiritual {{values to}} Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and Red Hill and originally planned to cover {{each of these}} in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary color which represented its spiritual value. This part of their plan never came to fruition. In fact, WWI interrupted the construction and some conflicts after the war made it a difficult process for the Griffins. Nevertheless, Canberra stands halfway between the ski slopes and the beach. It enjoys a <b>natural</b> <b>cooling</b> from geophysical factors.|$|E

An approximate formula is proposed for computing the cooling capacity of FCUs when the temperature of water supply is a little higher than designed temperature. Finally, recommendations are given {{for the design of}} the FCUs to follow dry operating conditions in the air conditioning system that directly utilize <b>natural</b> <b>cool</b> resources...|$|R
40|$|<b>Natural</b> draft dry <b>cooling</b> {{system is}} {{believed}} to be a cost-effective option for most proposed geothermal power plants, which use enhanced geothermal system (EGS), in Australia. These sites are all in remote areas and are short of water resource. Two types of hybrid <b>natural</b> draft steel <b>cooling</b> towers, namely solar hybrid <b>natural</b> draft <b>cooling</b> tower and water spray enhanced <b>natural</b> draft <b>cooling</b> tower, are proposed. The aim of using hybrid cooling is to improve the performance of <b>natural</b> draft dry <b>cooling</b> towers at high ambient temperatures, and to reduce the construction cost as well as construction time of building such towers at these remote areas...|$|R
25|$|Sometimes, <b>natural</b> draft <b>cooling</b> towers are {{constructed}} with structural steel {{in place of}} concrete (RCC) when the construction time of <b>natural</b> draft <b>cooling</b> tower is exceeding the construction time {{of the rest of}} the plant or the local soil is of poor strength to bear the heavy weight of RCC cooling towers or cement prices are higher at a site to opt for cheaper <b>natural</b> draft <b>cooling</b> towers made of structural steel.|$|R
25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{deposits of}} nahcolite (NaHCO3) {{are found in}} the Eocene-age (55.8–33.9 Mya) Green River Formation, Piceance Basin in Colorado. Nahcolite was deposited as beds during periods of high evaporation in the basin. It is commercially mined using common underground mining techniques such as bore, drum, and longwall mining in a fashion very similar to coal mining. A very small portion is also obtained using in situ leach techniques involving dissolution of the nahcolite by heated water pumped through the nahcolite beds that have previously been mined using the aforementioned techniques. It is then reconstituted through a <b>natural</b> <b>cooling</b> crystallization process. Currently only Tronox (formerly FMC) in the Green River Wyoming basin has successfully commercially solution mined the product.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} {{will have a}} total of 59 elevators, five {{of which will be}} double-deck elevators, as well as 12escalators. It will also have the highest observation deck in the world, to which high speed elevators will travel at up to 10 metres (33feet) per second (slightly over [...] ) in both directions. The elevators cannot go faster because the change in air pressure at such a rapid speed could cause nausea; at , the air pressure is over 10 kPa (1.5 psi) lower than at ground level (a 10% reduction in air pressure). They must also be efficient so the cables are not unbearably heavy. Jeddah Tower will have three sky lobbies where elevator transfers can be made, and no elevator will go from the bottom to the highest occupied floor. No official floor count has been given; however, Smith stated in a television interview that it will be about 50 floors more than the Burj Khalifa, which has 163occupied floors, leading to the inference that Jeddah Tower will have over 200floors. The tower will also feature a large, roughly [...] diameter outdoor balcony, known as the sky terrace, {{on one side of the}} building for private use by the penthouse floor at level 157; it is not the observation deck. It was originally intended to be a helipad, but it was revealed to be an unsuitable landing environment by helicopter pilots. The building's large notches will also serve as shaded terraces for other areas of the tower and the exterior of the {{building will}} use low-conductivity glass to save on cooling costs by reducing thermal loads. In addition, the lower air density, exacerbated by the thin desert atmosphere, will cause the outdoor air temperature towards the top of the tower to be lower than the ground level air, which will provide <b>natural</b> <b>cooling.</b> There is also significantly more air flow (wind) at heights, which is very strong at one kilometre and had a large impact on the structural design of the tower. The Burj Khalifa actually takes in the cooler, cleaner air from the top floors and uses it to air condition the building. Jeddah Tower will be oriented such that no façade directly faces the sun; it will also use the condensate water from the air conditioning system for irrigation and other purposes throughout the building.|$|E
2500|$|Intensive piggeries are {{generally}} large warehouse-like buildings or barns. [...] Indoor pig systems allow the pigs' conditions to be monitored, ensuring minimum fatalities and increased productivity. Buildings are ventilated and their temperature regulated. [...] Most domestic pig varieties {{are susceptible to}} sunburn and heat stress, and all pigs lack sweat glands and cannot cool themselves. Pigs have a limited tolerance to high temperatures and heat stress can lead to death. [...] Maintaining a more specific temperature within the pig-tolerance range also maximizes growth and growth-to-feed ratio. [...] Indoor piggeries have allowed pig farming to be undertaken in countries or areas with unsuitable climate or soil for outdoor pig raising.

2500|$|The Benjamin & Shermerhorn {{building}} {{was built in}} 1857 by contractor S.G. Rounds. The {{building was}} originally built as a dry goods store which was operated by Edward Benjamin and John Shermerhorn. Their store occupied {{the first floor of}} the three-story building. The store was the beneficiary of excellent basement storage conditions resulting from a well that was struck during construction which provided a <b>natural</b> <b>cooling</b> system for the perishables the store carried. The building has had other notable tenants during its history as well. The Bloomington newspaper, The Pantagraph, was housed on the building's third floor until 1868. The paper, during this period in its history, was known as a radical [...] "black republican" [...] paper because of its stance on slavery and support for Abraham Lincoln. A local loan broker, Henry Capen & Sons, occupied the second floor from 1886 until 1926. The building's longest tenant, however, was W.B. Read and Co., a stationery and book company that started on the first floor and 1895 and later moved to occupy the entire building until the owner, William Read's, death in 1951. In 1952 Osco Drugs took over the building and the pharmacy later expanded into the connected Marblestone Building next door.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>cooling</b> - <b>Natural</b> <b>cooling</b> {{refers to}} the use of {{ventilation}} or natural heat sinks for heat dissipation from indoor spaces. <b>Natural</b> <b>cooling</b> can be separated into five categories different categories: ventilation, night flushing, radiative cooling, evaporative cooling, and earth coupling.|$|E
50|$|Passive cooling is a {{building}} design approach {{that focuses on}} heat gain control and heat dissipation in {{a building}} {{in order to improve}} the indoor thermal comfort with low or no energy consumption. This approach works either by preventing heat from entering the interior (heat gain prevention) or by removing heat from the building (<b>natural</b> <b>cooling).</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>cooling</b> utilizes on-site energy, available from the natural environment, combined with the architectural design of building components (e.g. building envelope), rather than mechanical systems to dissipate heat. Therefore, <b>natural</b> <b>cooling</b> depends not only on the architectural design of the building but on how the site's natural resources are used as heat sinks (i.e. everything that absorbs or dissipates heat). Examples of on-site heat sinks are the upper atmosphere (night sky), the outdoor air (wind), and the earth/soil.|$|E

40|$|The heat {{rejection}} rate of <b>natural</b> draft dry <b>cooling</b> tower, {{as well as}} the operating performance of a power plant, can be affected by numerous ambient factors. The cold inflow is an unfavourable air turbulence {{at the top of the}} cooling tower and has a significant negative effect on the performance of <b>natural</b> draft <b>cooling</b> towers. In the present research, results are given for a 20 m high <b>natural</b> draft dry <b>cooling</b> tower experimental system tested at different ambient conditions. Several events of cold air incursion into the top of the cooling tower are identified and the detailed experimental data are presented. The experimental data show that this effect could seriously impair the thermal performance of the cooling tower. The water outlet temperature of the cooling tower has increased by as much as to 3 °C in these tests because of the cold inflow effect. The mechanism and the solution are discussed based on the experimental data. The findings in this paper can lay an important foundation for future small <b>natural</b> draft <b>cooling</b> tower design and operation...|$|R
