5000|$|Levi and Zanetti {{extended}} the Knorr synthesis in 1894 {{to the use}} of acetylacetone (2,4-pentanedione) in reaction with ethyl 2-oximinoacetoacetate. The result was ethyl 4-acetyl-3,5-dimethylpyrrole-2-carboxylate, where [...] "OEt" [...] = R1 = R3 = Me, and R2 = COOEt. The 4-acetyl group could easily be converted to a 4-ethyl group by Wolff-Kishner reduction (hydrazine and alkali, heated); hydrogenolysis, or the use of diborane. Benzyl or tert-butyl acetoacetates also work well in this system, and with close temperature control, the tert-butyl system gives a very high yield (close to 80%). N,N-dialkyl pyrrole-2- and/or 4-carboxamides may be prepared by the use of N,N-dialkyl acetoacetamides in the synthesis. Even thioesters have been successfully prepared, using the method. As for the <b>nitrosation</b> of &beta;-ketoesters, despite the numerous literature specifications of tight temperature control on the <b>nitrosation,</b> the reaction behaves almost like a titration, and the mixture can be allowed to reach even 40 °C without significantly impacting the final yield.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{practice}} {{is to add}} the oxime solution resulting from the <b>nitrosation</b> and the zinc dust gradually to a well-stirred solution of ethyl acetoacetate in glacial acetic acid.

The resulting product, diethyl 3,5-dimethylpyrrole-2,4-dicarboxylate, has been called Knorr's Pyrrole ever since.

5000|$|It {{can also}} be formed {{synthetically}} by taking the following steps: The potent carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is present in tobacco and tobacco smoke. Carbonyl14CNNK (6) was synthesized in 27% overall yield. Carboxyl-14C nicotinic acid was esterified with benzyl alcohol and the ester was alkylated by 3-lithio-N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one. The resulting keto-lactam was hydrolyzed and decarboxylated by treatment with boiling hydrochloric acid. <b>Nitrosation</b> at pH 4.0 gave carbonyl-14CNNK.

5000|$|NNN {{is found}} {{in a variety of}} tobacco {{products}} including smokeless tobacco like chewing tobacco and snuff, cigarettes, and cigars. It is present in smoke from cigars and cigarettes, in the saliva of people who chew betel quid with tobacco, and in the saliva of oral-snuff users. NNN is produced by the <b>nitrosation</b> of nornicotine during the curing, aging, processing, and smoking of tobacco.

50|$|NNN is a {{derivative}} of nicotine that {{is produced in}} the Curing of tobacco, in the burning of tobacco (such as with cigarettes), and in the acidic conditions of the stomach. Nicotine is converted into Nornicotine via Nicotine N-Demethylase (NND), an enzyme found in the tobacco plant that works by removing the methyl group from the nitrogen on the 5-membered ring of nicotine. From there, Nornicotine undergoes <b>nitrosation</b> (the conversion of organic compounds into nitroso derivatives by gaining a Nitrosonium (N=O) group) on that same nitrogen, converting it to NNN.|$|E

Mirvish, ascorbate inhibits <b>nitrosation</b> of amines to nitrosamine, because ascorbate reacts with [...] to form NO. Ascorbate and pH 5 thus favor nitrosylation of heme iron, forming nitrosylheme, a red pigment when included inside myoglobin, and a pink pigment when it has been released by cooking. It participates to the [...] "bacon flavor" [...] of cured meat: nitrosylheme is thus considered {{a benefit for the}} meat industry and for consumers.|$|E
50|$|Condensation of oximinoketone 2 (from <b>nitrosation</b> of 3-pentanone), with cyclohexane-1,3-dione (1) in the {{presence}} of zinc and acetic acid leads directly to the partly reduced indole derivative 6. The transformation may be rationalized by assuming as the first step, reduction of 2 to the corresponding α-aminoketone. Conjugate addition of the amine to 1 followed by elimination of hydroxide (as water) would give ene-aminoketone 3. This enamine may be assumed to be in tautomeric equilibrium with imine 4. Aldol condensation of the side chain carbonyl group with the doubly activated ring methylene group would then result in cyclization to pyrrole 5; simple tautomeric transformation would then give the observed product. Mannich reaction of 6 with formaldehyde and morpholine gives the tranquilizer molindone (7).|$|E
50|$|In years {{following}} the work Baudisch and Cronheim did, Konecny and Marayuma et al. suggested possible mechanisms for the Baudisch reaction. Konecny proposed that instead of the nitroso group adding first followed {{by the addition of}} a hydroxyl group as Baudisch predicted, the OH group added first through a similar radical mechanism with the hydroxyl radical coming from Hydrogen Peroxide after which the nitroso group is added by nitrous acid which he proposed was an intermediate under the reaction conditions. Marayuma et al. pointed some flaws in Konecny's proposal. They maintained that the <b>nitrosation</b> of a phenol (as Konecny's mechanism posed) through the intermediate nitrous acid was impossible under the reaction conditions because it would involve an ortho substitution of a phenol which is thermodynamically unfavorable which was the reason Konecny observed very low percent yields.|$|E

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} covers the {{development}} of assays for bacterial <b>nitrosation</b> and nitrous oxide reductase. The use of these two assays and the nitrite reductase assay allowed a detailed study {{not only of the}} correlation between nitrite reductase and <b>nitrosation</b> but also between nitrous oxide reductase and <b>nitrosation</b> in Neisseria subflava. The three activities have been studied with various electron donors and inhibitors and also with cells grown under various conditions. Maximum activities were:- Nitrite reductase 1130 nmol/min/mg protein with lactate as electron donor, Nitrous oxide reductase 7. 17 ^unol/min/mg protein with glucose as electron donor 7 and <b>nitrosation</b> 427 nmol/min/mg protein with ethanol as electron donor. When this work was coupled with the production of N. subflava mutants deficient in different aspects of denitrification using insertional transposon mutagenesis it provided a wealth of information regarding the correlation between denitrification and bacterial <b>nitrosation.</b> The strains of N. subflava isolated from the achlorhydric stomach were all able to nitrosate. The ability to nitrosate required the reduction of nitrite but nitrite reductase itself was unable to catalyse <b>nitrosation.</b> Reactions involving nitrous oxide, nitrous oxide reductase and dinitrogen were shown to have no involvement in bacterial <b>nitrosation.</b> Leaving only nitric oxide and nitric oxide reductase as possible connections between bacterial <b>nitrosation</b> and denitrification. With the knowledge that oxygen was required for bacterial <b>nitrosation</b> and the growth conditions necessary to induce bacterial <b>nitrosation</b> a hypothesis could be proposed to connect <b>nitrosation</b> activity and denitrification: Nitric oxide may accumulate following nitrite reduction and could be subsequently oxidised (by molecular oxygen) to produce dinitrogen trioxide and dinitrogen tetroxide. These two products are known to be very powerful nitrosating agents which can then react with amines, amides and ureas to produce various N-nitroso compounds. As the strains of N. subflava used in this work were gastric isolates it is plausible that these reactions producing N-nitroso compounds could occur in the stomach. This would account for the high risk from gastric cancer seen in patients whose gastric pH is close to 7 allowing bacteria to colonise the stomach...|$|E
40|$|Nitrite {{has long}} been {{considered}} a potential pre-carcinogen for gastric cancer. Acidification of salivary nitrite, derived from dietary nitrate, produces nitrosative species such as NOSCN, NO + and N 2 O 3, which can form potentially carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds. Ascorbic acid inhibits <b>nitrosation</b> by converting the nitrosative species into nitric oxide (NO). However, NO diffuses rapidly to adjacent lipids, where it reacts with oxygen to reform nitrosative species. <b>Nitrosation</b> has been studied in vitro in aqueous systems and less frequently in organic systems; however, {{there is a need}} to investigate acid-catalysed <b>nitrosation</b> in a system combining aqueous and lipid environments, hence providing a physiologically relevant model. Here, we describe a two-phase system, which can be used as a tool to understand acid-catalysed <b>nitrosation.</b> Using gas chromatography/ion trap tandem mass spectrometry, we investigated the <b>nitrosation</b> of secondary amines as a function of the lipid phase composition and reaction mixing. An increased interface surface area was a driver for <b>nitrosation,</b> while incorporation of unsaturated fatty acids affected morpholine and piperidine <b>nitrosation</b> differently. Linoleic acid methyl esters did not affect morpholine <b>nitrosation</b> and only had a limited effect on N-nitrosopiperidine formation, while incorporation of free linoleic acid to the lipid phase significantly reduced N-nitrosopiperidine formation, but increased N-nitrosomorpholine formation at low levels. The mechanisms driving these effects are thought to involve amine partitioning, polarity and unsaturated fatty acids acting as scavengers of nitrosating species, findings relevant to the nitrosative chemistry occurring in the stomach, where the gastric acid meets a range of dietary fats which are emulsified during digestion...|$|E
40|$|Intragastric <b>nitrosation</b> {{has been}} implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of gastric cancer and in precancerous conditions such as pernicious anaemia and the post-gastrectomy state. Intragastric <b>nitrosation</b> was assessed in at-risk patients by N-nitrosoproline (NPRO) excretion using both a conventional and a modified test. Twenty-four hour urinary excretion of NPRO was measured after oral administration of sodium nitrate (300 mg) and L-proline (500 mg) as an indirect indicator of intragastric <b>nitrosation.</b> In the conventional test no differences in intragastric <b>nitrosation</b> were found between at-risk patients and controls.

40|$|Kinetic and {{mechanistic}} studies involving <b>nitrosation</b> reactions of some carbonyl compounds were undertaken. The <b>nitrosation</b> of the carbonyl compounds proceeded via their corresponding enol forms and {{the products of}} the reactions were the oximes. Significant nucleophilic catalysis by chloride, bromide, thiocyanate ions and thiourea was observed in all cases. Most of the kinetic results are consistent with a mechanism involving a rate limiting reaction between H(_ 2) N 0 (_ 2) (^+) / N 0 (^+) or the NOX species (in presence of nucleophile X') and the enol. The general mechanistic features of the <b>nitrosation</b> of the enols fitted in well with the pattern now well established in <b>nitrosation</b> at N, S, 0, and other C sites. The reactions of the enol form of ethylacetoacetate with the different nitrosating species were not encounter controlled indicating that the presence of the electron withdrawing group reduces the reactivity of the enol, relative to that derived from acetone. Kinetic studies on <b>nitrosation</b> of dimedone and 1, 1, 1 -trifluoropentane 2 - 4 -dione revealed that reactions proceeded not only via the neutral enol but also via the enolate ion. The reactions of the latter with all the nitrosating species occurred at the encounter rate. The values of the rate constants suggest that the enolate ion {{is one of the most}} reactive species studied in <b>nitrosation.</b> Its high reactivity therefore makes it an excellent potential nitrite trap. The mechanism of <b>nitrosation</b> of Meldrum's acid has not been completely elucidated.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{develops a}} comprehensive kinetic {{model of the}} N-nitrosation reaction mechanism, consisting almost entirely of elementary reaction steps and applies it to study the <b>nitrosation</b> of ammonia. The reaction mechanism features 26 species and 22 reactions, with 8 parallel reaction pathways for ammonia <b>nitrosation</b> and a side pathway for nitrous acid decomposition. We compiled forward and reverse rate constants {{for each of the}} reactions, either from the literature sources or by correlation with known rate and equilibrium constants. The concentration of each reaction species with respect to time can be obtained for any set of initial concentrations by invoking a simultaneous solution to the system of ordinary differential equations describing the reaction mechanism. The model successfully predicts previous experimental results for ammonia <b>nitrosation,</b> with and without the addition of the catalyst thiocyanate. The effect of pH on the rate and mechanism of ammonia <b>nitrosation</b> was studied with the model. For uncatalyzed <b>nitrosation,</b> the results indicate that between pH 6. 0 and 1. 5 the reaction proceeds predominantly via reaction with N 2 O 3, whereas ON + <b>nitrosation</b> becomes the preferred pathway below pH 1. 5. ONSCN is the dominant nitrosating agent across the entire pH range studied when the nucleophile thiocyanate was added in appreciable quantities. However, with the weak nucleophile Cl -, <b>nitrosation</b> by N 2 O 3 and ON + governed the reaction kinetics at high and low pH, respectively, We demonstrate that nitrosating agent formation is rapid and does not limit the rate of ammonia nitrosation; however, nitrosating agent formation could become the rate-limiting step for the <b>nitrosation</b> of highly reactive substrates...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Amines {{formed by}} {{biosynthesis}} in germinated barley {{have been suggested}} as precursors for N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in barley malt dried by direct-fired kilning. This hypothesis was verified by germinating raw barley and exposing the resulting malt roots and clean malt to nitrous acid. Quantitation of the NDMA formed indicated that malt roots contained relatively large amounts of NDMA precursor which {{could only have been}} formed as a result of germination. The clean malt also contained NDMA precursor, but the amount of precursor in clean malt was only slightly higher than the level of precursor already present in raw barley. The two tertiary amine alkaloids, hordenine and gramine, which are biosynthesized in malt during germination were subjected to <b>nitrosation.</b> <b>Nitrosation</b> of both amines at 65 ° (pH 4. 4 or pH 6. 4) resulted in NDMA formation. Gramine was highly susceptible to <b>nitrosation</b> to yield NDMA. At 24 ° in dilute acetic acid (pH 3. 4), the initial rate of <b>nitrosation</b> of gramine to yield NDMA was nearly equal to the initial rate of NDMA formation from dimethylamine. The ratio of initial rates of formation of NDMA from gramine and trimethylamine was 6250 : 1. At 23 °, the ratio of initial rates of formation of NDMA from gramine and hordenine was 5200 : 1. N-Methyltyramine and N-methyl-S-aminomethylindole, the immediate biosynthetic precursors of hordenine and gramine, were synthesized. <b>Nitrosation</b> of N-methyltyramine yielded p-hydroxy-N-nitroso-N-methyl- 2 -phenylethylamine as the major reaction product and p-hydroxy-m-nitro- N-nitroso-N-methyl- 2 -phenylethylamine as the minor product. <b>Nitrosation</b> of N-methyl- 3 -aminomethylindole yielded N-nitroso-N-methyl- 3 - aminomethylindole as the minor reaction product; the major product was a dinitroso compound identified as N¹-nitroso-N-nitroso-N-methyl- 3 - aminomethylindole. Investigation of the products of hordenine <b>nitrosation</b> at 65 ° (pH 4. 4) indicated the formation of NDMA and p-hydroxy-m-nitro-N-nitroso- N-methyl- 2 -phenylethyl amine; p-hydroxy-N-nitroso-N-methyl- 2 - phenylethylamine was not observed as a product of hordenine <b>nitrosation</b> at 65 °. NDMA appeared to be the major nitrosamine formed from hordenine. The rapid reaction of gramine with nitrous acid and investigation of the gramine <b>nitrosation</b> reaction products both indicated that gramine did not undergo <b>nitrosation</b> by the expected mechanism of nitrosative dealkylation.

40|$|Background: Dietary nitrate {{increases}} saliva nitrite {{levels and}} swallowed saliva {{is the main}} source of nitrite entering the acidic stomach. In acidic gastric juice, this nitrite can generate potentially carcinogenic N-nitrosocompounds. However, ascorbic acid secreted by the gastric mucosa can prevent <b>nitrosation</b> by converting the nitrite to nitric oxide. Methods: To study the potential for N-nitrosocompound formation in a model simulating salivary nitrite entering the acidic stomach and the ability of ascorbic acid to inhibit the process. Concentrations of ascorbic acid, total vitamin C, nitrite, nitrosomorpholine, oxygen and nitric oxide were monitored during the experiments. Results: The delivery of nitrite into HCl containing thiocyanate resulted in <b>nitrosation</b> of morpholine, with the rate of <b>nitrosation</b> being greatest at pH 2. 5. Under anaerobic conditions, ascorbic acid converted the nitrite to nitric oxide and prevented <b>nitrosation.</b> However, in the presence of dissolved air, the ascorbic acid was ineffective at preventing <b>nitrosation.</b> This was due to the nitric oxide combining with oxygen to reform nitrite and this recycling of nitrite depleting the available ascorbic acid. Further studies indicated that the rate of consumption of ascorbic acid by nitrite added to natural human gastric juice (pH 1. 5) was extremely rapid with 200 μmol/l nitrite consumed 500 μmol/l ascorbic acid within 10 s. Conclusions: The rapid consumption of ascorbic acid in acidic gastric juice by nitrite in swallowed saliva indicates that the potential for acid <b>nitrosation</b> will be maximal at the GO junction and cardia where nitrite first encounters acidic gastric juice. The high incidence of mutagenesis and neoplasia at this anatomical location may be due to acid <b>nitrosation</b> arising from dietary nitrate...|$|E

The present work has boon concerned with some of the reactions involving the nitroso group at nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur sites,, The approach has been to determine rate constants for the reactions involved and to use these to establish mechanism and relative reactivities. The work covers four areas; (i) Denitrosation of N-nitrosoamines in solvents other than water It has been found that some solvents do enhance the rate of denitrosation relative to that in water. (ii) Diazotisation of aromatic amines. This reaction proceeds via the formation of an N=nitroso intermediate. The relative reactivities of a number of nitrosating species in this reaction have been established. (iii) <b>Nitrosation</b> of thiols. Few kinetic studies have been made of S-nitrosation (compared to N-nitrosation), here the rates of reaction of some tbiocarboxylie acids toward nitrosating species have been determined and comparisons with other substrates drawn. (iv) <b>Nitrosation</b> of alcohols. The kinetics of <b>nitrosation</b> of alcohols has already been studied in some detail and here the aim has been to use this reaction to throw some light {{on the nature of the}} intermediate in aqueous <b>nitrosation...</b>|$|E
