25|$|The US is the province's largest export market, {{accounting}} for 92% {{of a foreign}} trade valued in 2014 at C$12.964 billion. Refined petroleum accounted in 2014 for 63% of the total, followed by seafood products, pulp, paper and sawmill products and <b>non-metallic</b> <b>minerals</b> (chiefly potash).|$|E
25|$|Forest {{resources}} include {{timber and}} minerals, among them gold, copper, silver, chrome, and <b>non-metallic</b> <b>minerals</b> such as lime for making cement, and greenstones for ornaments.

30|$|Rubble, slag, and sludge, {{referred}} to as <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes, are frequently recycled as alternate materials for natural <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> resources such as dirt, crushed stone, sand, and clay. Concrete waste and asphalt concrete waste, which are <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes, are categorized as industrial wastes in Japan. According to the annual report of Japan’s Ministry of the Environment (2015), the emission of these <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes in 2012 was 56.7 million tons in the country, which accounted for 15 % of the 379.1 million tons of total industrial waste.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{circumstances}} described above, this paper, considering the case of Japan, investigates the material flow resulting from and the economic influence {{of the changes in}} supply and demand for <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes, focusing on the period from the near future to 2030. Specifically, we construct an input–output (IO) table to analyze <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes to identify monetary and material flows between industries related to supply and demand in <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes. Based on the constructed IO table, we predict the material flow and value added brought about by <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes in the future by applying a linear programming technique.|$|R
30|$|Using the IO {{table for}} the {{analysis}} of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes, this paper applies a linear programming technique to consider the material flow and value added brought about by <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes in 2030.|$|R
25|$|The {{mountains}} contain relatively unexploited {{deposits of}} gold, silver, iron, and coal. Although Veracruz {{is an important}} source of metals such as iron and copper, a great deal of its mining involves <b>non-metallic</b> <b>minerals</b> as sulfur, silica, feldspar, calcium, kaolin and marble. The state is ranked fourth in the nation for this kind of mining production. However, mining only accounts for 1.5% of economic activity for the entire state.|$|E
25|$|Other {{minerals}} {{that have}} been actively mined include copper in the Whitehorse area, lead and zinc in Faro, silver, zinc and lead in the Mayo/Keno City area, asbestos in Clinton Creek, and copper, gold, and coal in the Carmacks area. The world's largest known deposit of tungsten is in the Macmillan Pass area in the Mackenzie Mountains near the Northwest Territories border. <b>Non-metallic</b> <b>minerals</b> mined have included jade and barite.|$|E
25|$|The {{department}} contributes {{significantly to}} the national economy. According to statistics for the year 2005 as agricultural Valley contributes 5.37% of the national production, which is relatively low compared with Antioquia (15.48%) or Cundinamarca (12.81%). In fisheries products, the region ranks first with vallecaucana contributing 36% of the country's total production. As for mining, the Valley is not a metal region; however, in terms of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>minerals</b> the department contributes 8.15% of the value added across Colombia.|$|E

30|$|This paper, {{shedding}} {{light on}} the increase in generation of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes and decrease in demand for construction, investigates the material flow resulting from and the economic influence {{of changes in the}} supply and demand for wastes, focusing on the period from the near future to 2030. Specifically, we construct an IO table for the analysis of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes to identify monetary and material flows between industries related to the supply and demand for <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes. Based on the constructed IO table, we predict the material flow and value added brought about by <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes in 2030 in the BAU and the zero emission scenarios by developing a linear programming model.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on the {{increase}} in generation of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes and the decrease in demand for construction by investigating the material flow resulting from and the economic influence {{of changes in the}} supply and demand for wastes, focusing on the period from the near future to 2030. We predict the amount of final disposal of <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes and its influence on industries in the future under the assumption of two scenarios—zero emission and business-as-usual—using linear programming and input–output techniques developed for <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> materials. We conclude that zero emission can be achieved at the cost of a 3.76 % decrease in the value added of industries related to <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> wastes. Otherwise, the final disposal might increase 13 times the size of 2005 ’s disposal. Considering the empirical results, we discuss an effective policy for <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> waste management from the viewpoints of material flow and economic influence.|$|R
25|$|The {{streak of}} a mineral {{refers to the}} colour of a mineral in {{powdered}} form, {{which may or may}} not be identical to its body colour. The most common way of testing this property is done with a streak plate, which is made out of porcelain and coloured either white or black. The streak of a mineral is independent of trace elements or any weathering surface. A common example of this property is illustrated with hematite, which is coloured black, silver, or red in hand sample, but has a cherry-red to reddish-brown streak. Streak is more often distinctive for metallic minerals, in contrast to <b>non-metallic</b> <b>minerals</b> whose body colour is created by allochromatic elements. Streak testing is constrained by the hardness of the mineral, as those harder than 7 powder the streak plate instead.|$|E

40|$|China is {{the largest}} <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> {{producer}} {{in the world and}} one of the key consumers of four major <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> products, including cement, refractories, plate glass and ceramics. The <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> products industry’s rapid growth has brought about a large demand for energy. The present study provides an overview of China’s <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mineral</b> products industry in terms of production, energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. In this industry, the energy efficiency is relatively low and the level of carbon dioxide emission is much higher than developed countries’ average. This study interprets the effects of some newly issued policies and analyses the influential factors in achieving energy conservation and emission reduction goals. It also discusses the prospects for saving energy and emission reduction in the industry. Retrofitting facilities and using new production technologies is imperative. Additionally, implementing market-based policies, promoting industrial transformation and effective international cooperation would help decrease carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption...|$|R
