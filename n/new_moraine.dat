40|$|International audienceIn the Northern Hemisphere, most {{mountain}} glaciers experienced their largest {{extent in}} the last millennium during the Little Ice Age (1450 to 1850 CE, LIA), a period marked by colder hemispheric temperatures than the Medieval Climate Anomaly (950 to 1250 CE, MCA), a period which coincided with glacier retreat. Here, we present a <b>new</b> <b>moraine</b> chronology based on 36 Cl surface exposure dating from Lyngmarksbræen glacier, West Greenland. Consistent with other glaciers in the western Arctic, Lyngmarksbræen glacier experienced several advances during the last millennium, the first one {{at the end of}} the MCA, in ~ 1200 CE, was of similar amplitude to two other advances during the LIA. In the absence of any significant changes in accumulation records from South Greenland ice cores, we attribute this expansion to multi-decadal summer cooling likely driven by volcanic and/or solar forcing, and associated regional sea-ice feedbacks. Such regional multi-decadal cold conditions {{at the end of the}} MCA are neither resolved in temperature reconstructions from other parts of the Northern Hemisphere, nor captured in last millennium climate simulations...|$|E
40|$|A new lichen dating {{method and}} <b>new</b> <b>moraine</b> {{observations}} {{enabled us to}} improve the chronology of glacier advances in the Cordillera Blanca (Peru) during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Our results reveal that an early LIA glacial advance occurred around AD 1330 +/- 29. However, a second major glacial advance {{at the beginning of}} the 17 th century overlapped the earlier stage for most glaciers. Hence, this second glacial stage, dated from AD 1630 +/- 27, is considered as the LIA maximum glacial advance in the Cordillera Blanca. During the 17 th- 18 th centuries, at least three glacial advances were recorded synchronously for the different glaciers (AD 1670 +/- 24, 1730 +/- 21, and 1760 +/- 19). The moraines corresponding to the two first stages are close to the one in 1630 suggesting a slow recession of about 18 % in the total length of the glacier. From the LIA maximum extent to the beginning of the 20 th century, the 24 glaciers have retreated a distance of about 1000 in, corresponding to a reduction of 30 % in their length. This rate is comparable to that observed during the 20 th century. Estimates of palaeo-Equilibrium Line Altitudes show an increase in attitude of about 100 m from the LIA maximum glacial extension {{at the beginning of the}} 17 th century to the beginning of the 20 th century. Because long time series are not available for precipitation and temperature, this glacial retreat is difficult to explain by past climate changes. However, there is a fair correspondence between changes in glacier length and the delta O- 18 recorded in the Quelccaya ice core at a century timescale. Our current knowledge of tropical glaciers and isotope variations leads us to suggest that this common tropical signal reflects a change from a wet LIA to the drier conditions of today. Finally, a remarkable synchronicity is observed with glacial variations in Bolivia, suggesting a common regional climatic pattern during the LIA...|$|E

40|$|The Rombak-Skjomen area of {{northern}} Norway {{consists of a}} c. 2. 3 - 1. 78 Ga Proterozoic basement window overlain by Phanerozoic metamorphosed sedimentary rocks from the Caledonian Orogeny. The window consists of volcanic arc and sedimentary rocks deformed during the Svecokarelian Orogeny when the area was situated on {{the margin of the}} Norrbotten craton. The area is geologically similar to other important mining areas {{of northern}} Fennoscandia such as the Skellefte District and the Gold Line of northern Sweden. Exploration for gold and base metal deposits during the 1980 s produced a lot of geological, geophysical and geochemical data. Stream sediment survey data has been used together with <b>new</b> <b>moraine</b> sampling data {{to see if there is}} any relation between a recently identified shear zone and unexplained gold anomalies in nearby stream sediments (Larsen et al., 2010). Different statistical methods have been used to identify anomalous metal concentrations in stream sediment surveys to produce anomaly maps that can be used alongside the new data to identify areas of mineralisation. The area has the potential to host orogenic gold style mineralisation as has been found in other areas of northern Fennoscandia. Moraine samples have been taken in profiles across the shear zone and analysed to see if the moraine is a possible source of gold in these stream sediment anomalies and if the shear zone is gold bearing. Analysis of the moraine showed that the concentration of gold is very low and it is possible that the moraine is an indirect source of gold in stream sediment anomalies. Gold can enter moraine by weathering of gold bearing mineralisations in the surrounding bedrock, but because of its fine grained nature, it is quickly washed out of the moraine to be re-deposited in stream sediments several kilometres away from its parent rock. The area probably contains more than one type of gold mineralisation that are small, widely dispersed and have different mineralogy making them hard to locate using stream sediment sampling alone. The sampling results show that the moraine contains very low gold and arsenic concentrations. However, one sample collected close to a known mineralisation shows anomalous concentrations in several base metals. This means that moraine sampling can be used to locate base metal mineralisations by identifying metal anomalies down ice of the mineralisation. Higher concentrations of zinc where also found in samples collected close to the inferred shear zone and moraine sampling may be able to identify large scale structures such as shear zones if they contain higher concentrations of certain metals such as zinc or arsenic. There is the potential to find new mineralisation in the Rombak basement window especially at depth which has only been drilled at a small number of locations. A gold bearing quartz-ankerite boulder was found in the moraine may be similar to a new gold mineralisation found in the Mauken basement window further to the north. It is important to understand the relationships between these two basement windows and how they fit in to the tectonics at the margins of the Norrbotten craton during the Proterozoic.

40|$|Climate change due to {{anthropogenic}} emissions {{of greenhouse gases}} is predicted to increase the average surface temperature. The most evident soil changes in the Alps will occur in proglacial areas where already existing young soils (with an age in most cases of up to 150 years) will continuously develop and new soils will form due to glacier retreat. Based on existing soil chronosequence data and statistical analyses in the proglacial area Morteratsch (Switzerland), the present-day state of the soils as well as their future development in the next 100 years in the existing and new proglacial area has been modeled taking the retreat of the glacier into consideration. The present-day as well as the future soil distribution was modeled using a probabilistic approach. Several soil characteristics have been modeled such as the pH value, the skeleton content, and the soil depth relevant to plant growth. To model soil properties in a future proglacial area (that is now covered by ice), the glacier-bed morphology had to be modeled. The calculations were performed using the cubic Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curve to parameterize the course of a branch in flow direction. With the help of the ice cap and relief factor the thickness of the glacier was modeled. Climate change was introduced numerically by changing the mass balance of the glacier. For the area of interest a temperature increase of + 1. 6 °C by the year 2050 and + 3 °C by the year 2100 can be assumed (according to the scenario A 1 B of IPCC).

A considerable part of the upper proglacial area does not have any soil cover. Lithic/Skeletic to Humi- Skeletic Leptosols are modeled on the young lateral moraines. Chronosequences were vital to make any (4 D) predictions of soil evolution in the proglacial area. The statistically and probabilistically based model also had, however, its weaknesses.

40|$|Previous {{uncertainty}} in the continuity of mapped <b>moraines</b> of central <b>New</b> York east of the Utica meridian resulted from the rug-ged topography and the complex interaction of the Mohawk and Ontario ice lobes. Till composition, fabric, stratigraphy, and drumlin morphology demonstrate that Valley Heads drift was de-posited by a major readvance of the Ontario lobe after recession of the Mohawk lobe. This study names and describes a previously un-recognized moraine between Cassville and Cooperstown, <b>New</b> York. The <b>moraine</b> crosses several divides, permitting calculation of ice-front gradients, which are {{comparable to those of}} active, steady-state, temperate glaciers. Ice-slope considerations and to-pography suggest correlation of the Cassville-Cooperstown ice border with the Wagon Wheel Gap Substage in the Catskill Moun-tains. Mapping the Cassville-Cooperstown moraine makes possible the tracing of older recessional positions of the ice sheet. Recession is inferred as uniform, with little local-valley control, suggesting an active retreating ice front rather than widespread stagnation. Although previous writers have suggested otherwise, ice recession was subparallel to the Terminal moraine in Pennsylvania and per-pendicular to striations and to through valleys. Regional correlations imply that deposition of the Cassville-Cooperstown moraine was simultaneous with the Rosendale readvance in the Wallkill Valley inferred at 14, 800 radiocarbon yr B. P. Recession of the Mohawk lobe and readvance of the Ontario lobe to the Valley Heads moraine is suggested to be concurrent, re-sulting from initial isostatic rebound subsequent to deglaciation of the Adirondack dome...|$|R
60|$|A {{survey of}} the present {{condition}} of the earth supports this view, for though we have enormous mountain ranges in every latitude, there is no glaciated country south of Greenland in N. Lat. 61°. But directly we go back a very short period, we find the superficial evidences of glaciation to an enormous extent over three-fourths of the globe. In the Alps and Pyrenees, in the British Isles and Scandinavia, in Spain and the Atlas, in the Caucasus {537} and the Himalayas, in Eastern North America and west of the Rocky Mountains, in the Andes of South Temperate America, in South Africa, and in <b>New</b> Zealand, huge <b>moraines</b> and other unmistakable ice-marks attest the universal descent of the snow-line for several thousand feet below its present level. If we reject the influence of high excentricity {{as the cause of}} this almost universal glaciation, we must postulate a general elevation of all these mountains about the same time, geologically speaking--for the general similarity in the state of preservation of the ice-marks and the known activity of denudation as a destroying agent, forbid the idea that they belong to widely separated epochs. It has, indeed, been suggested, that denudation alone has lowered these mountains so much during the post-tertiary epoch, that they were previously of sufficient height to account for the glaciation of all of them; but this hardly needs refutation, for it is clear that denudation could not at the same time have removed some thousands of feet of rock from many hundreds of square miles of lofty snow-collecting plateaus, and yet have left moraines, and blocks, and even glacial striæ, undisturbed and uneffaced on the slopes and in the valleys of these same mountains.|$|R
40|$|Ice sheet {{modeling}} is {{an essential}} tool for estimating the effect of climate change on the Greenland ice sheet. The large spatial and long-term temporal scale ofice sheet models limits the amount of data {{which can be used}} to test model results. A framework for the analysis of glacial geological data to test ice sheetmodels is illustrated by a case study in west Greenland. A geological scenario of ice margin positions since the Last Glacial Maximum is based on a review ofexisting literature and <b>new</b> datings of <b>moraine</b> systems. Ages of moraine systems and associated accuracy ranges are interpolated to 1 x 1 km grid over an areaof about 57500 km 2. Resampling to a 20 x 20 km grid on ice sheet model coordinates enables a quantitative comparison with modeled ice marginal positions. In view of the uncertainties in the geological scenario, with moraine system ages having an absolute uncertainty of 700 to 3300 cal yrs, the Greenland icesheet model of Huybrechts provides a reasonable simulation of the deglaciation pattern in central west Greenland. Modeled timing of the position of the icemargin generally precedes the geological record by 900 yr. The difference between geology and model is large for areas without proper geologicalinformation and small, but still about 500 - 950 yrs, for well-dated moraine systems. Model deficiencies in west Greenland are probably related to the forcingfunction driving ablation estimates, and especially the forcing function for sea level and the description of calving processes should be reviewed critically. Thesimplified topography used by the model could also induce errors. Although topography used in models neglects possible important features as ice streams,we do not find any significant trend between differences and relief amplitude. Missing moraine systems on {{the southern part of the}} shelf, and absence ofgeological information from underneath the present-day ice sheet affect the character and quality of the geological scenario...|$|R
40|$|The Younger Dryas stadial, a cold event {{spanning}} 12, 800 to 11, 500 years ago, {{during the}} last deglaciation, is thought {{to coincide with the}} last major glacial re-advance in the tropical Andes(1). This interpretation relies mainly on cosmic-ray exposure dating of glacial deposits. Recent studies, however, have established new production rates' for cosmogenic Be- 10 and He- 3, which make it necessary to update all chronologies in this region(1, 5 - 15) and revise our understanding of cryospheric responses to climate variability. Here we present a <b>new</b> Be- 10 <b>moraine</b> chronology in Colombia showing that glaciers in the northern tropical Andes expanded to a larger extent during the Antarctic cold reversal (14, 500 to 12, 900 years ago) than during the Younger Dryas. On the basis of a homogenized chronology of all Be- 10 and He- 3 moraine ages across the tropical Andes, we show that this behaviour was common to the northern and southern tropical Andes. Transient simulations with a coupled global climate model suggest that the common glacier behaviour was the result of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation variability superimposed on a deglacial increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. During the Antarctic cold reversal, glaciers advanced primarily in response to cold sea surface temperatures over much of the Southern Hemisphere. During the Younger Dryas, however, northern tropical Andes glaciers retreated owing to abrupt regional warming in response to reduced precipitation and land-surface feedbacks triggered by a weakened Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Conversely, glacier retreat during the Younger Dryas in the southern tropical Andes occurred as a result of progressive warming, probably influenced by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Considered with evidence from mid-latitude Andean glaciers(16), our results argue for a common glacier response to cold conditions in the Antarctic cold reversal exceeding that of the Younger Dryas...|$|R
40|$|Glacier length {{fluctuations}} reflect {{changes in}} climate, most notably temperature and precipitation. By this reasoning, moraines, which represent former glacier extent, {{can be used}} to estimate past climate. However, estimating palaeoclimate from moraines is not a straight-forward process and involves several assumptions. For example, recent studies have suggested that interannual stochastic variability in temperature in a steady-state climate can cause a glacier to experience kilometre-scale fluctuations. Such studies cast doubt on the usefulness of moraines as climate proxy indicators. Detailed glacial geomorphological maps and moraine chronologies have improved our understanding of the spatial and temporal extent of past glacial events in New Zealand. Palaeoclimate estimates associated with these moraines have thus-far come from simple methods, such as the accumulation area ratio, with unquantifiable uncertainties. I used a numerical modelling approach to approximate the present-day glacier mass balance pattern, which includes the effects of snow avalanching on glacier mass balance. I then used the models to reconstruct palaeoclimate for Lateglacial and Holocene glacial events in New Zealand, and to better understand moraine-glacier-climate relationships. The climate reconstructions come from simulating past glacier expansions to specific terminal moraines, but I also simulated glacier fluctuations in response to a previously derived temperature reconstruction, and to interannual stochastic variability in temperature. The purpose behind each simulation was to identify the drivers of significant glacier fluctuations. The modelling results support the hypothesis that <b>New</b> Zealand <b>moraine</b> records reflect past climate, especially changes in temperature. Lateglacial climate was reconstructed to be 2 - 3 C lower than the present day. This temperature range agrees well with previous estimates from moraines and other climate proxy records in New Zealand. Modelled temperature estimates for the Holocene moraines are slightly colder than those derived from simpler methods, due to a non-linear relationship found between snowline lowering and glacier length. This relationship results from the specific valley shape and glacier geometry, and is likely to occur in other, similarly-shaped glacier valleys. The simulations forced by interannual stochastic variability in temperature do not show significant (> 300 m) fluctuations in the glacier terminus. Such fluctuations can not explain the Holocene moraine sequence that I examined, which extends > 2 km beyond the present-day glacier terminus. Stochastic temperature change could, however, in part, cause fluctuations in glacier extent during an overall glacier recession. Modelling shows that it is also unlikely that glaciers advanced to Holocene and Lateglacial moraine positions as a result of precipitation changes alone. For these reasons, temperature changes are a necessary part of explaining past glacier extents, especially during the Lateglacial, and the moraines examined here likely reflect changes in mean climate in New Zealand. The glacier modelling studies indicate that simpler methods, such as the accumulation area ratio, {{can be used to}} appropriately reconstruct past climate from glacial evidence, as long as the glacier catchment has a straight forward geometry, shallow bed slope and no tributary glaciers. Non-linear relationships between climate change and glacier length develop when valley shape is more complex, and glaciers within these systems are probably better simulated using a modelling approach. Using a numerical modelling approach, it is also possible to gain a greater understanding of glacier response time, length sensitivities, and estimates of ice extent in valleys within the model domain where geomorphic evidence is not available. In this manner, numerical models {{can be used as a}} tool for understanding past climate and glacier sensitivity, thus improving the confidence in the palaeoclimate interpretations...|$|R
