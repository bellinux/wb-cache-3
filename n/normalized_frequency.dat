A first-order filter's response rolls off at −6 dB per octave (−20 dB per decade) (all first-order lowpass filters {{have the same}} <b>normalized</b> <b>frequency</b> response). A second-order filter decreases at −12 dB per octave, a third-order at −18 dB and so on.

METHODS: Heart rate and sleep electroencephalogram signals were recorded in 8 healthy young men. Spectral analysis was applied to electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram recordings. Spectral components of RR intervals were studied across sleep stages. The cross-spectrum maximum was determined as well as coherencies, gains and phase shifts between <b>normalized</b> high <b>frequency</b> of RR intervals and all electroencephalographic frequency bands, calculated over the first 3 NREM-REM cycles. RESULTS: RR intervals increased from awake to NREM and decreased during REM. <b>Normalized</b> low <b>frequency</b> decreased from awake to NREM and increased during REM while <b>normalized</b> high <b>frequency</b> evolved conversely. Low to high frequency ratio developed in opposition to RR intervals. Coherencies between <b>normalized</b> high <b>frequency</b> and power spectra were high for all bands. The gain was highest for delta band. Phase shift between <b>normalized</b> high <b>frequency</b> and delta differed from zero and modifications in <b>normalized</b> high <b>frequency</b> preceded changes in delta by 41 +/- 14 degrees. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that: (1) all electroencephalographic power bands are linked to normalized high frequency; (2) modifications in cardiac vagal activity show predominantly parallel changes and precede changes in delta band by a phase shift corresponding to a lead of 12 +/- 5 min.
