25|$|A {{frequent}} charge laid by {{the critics}} of the Commissioners' Plan is that the excavation and leveling necessary to implement it basically destroyed the topography of Manhattan. Recent studies, however, have shown that while the topography of the island certainly changed, what exists now is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> different from the original topography as the critics would suggest.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the result, leading Scottish Conservative {{supporter}} Paul McBride QC resigned from the party, citing that he 'frequently found himself {{at odds with the}} party in recent months', particularly with their policy on anti-sectarianism legislation and said of new party leader Ruth Davidson, that 'they have a leader who has no policies and little experience apart from having been on television about as many times as I have' and that (the Scottish Conservatives) 'replaced one nice woman with one <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> nice woman'.|$|E
25|$|The sartorial inclinations of the Qajar {{period were}} <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> {{different}} from those of earlier period until {{the latter half of the}} era. As is evidenced by the early portraiture of Fath Ali Shah Qajar and Mohammad Shah Qajar, the traditional styles of dress in Persia were preserved, but as Western influences became more and more prevalent, the royal portraits began to depict the Shah in a more Western, military style garb (such as the portrait of Nassirudin Shah Qajar above). This is not to say, however, that the traditional textile arts of Persia had fallen into disuse. While the Shah wished to appear advanced and western to European monarchs and diplomats, it was still his duty to exude the pride and ancient glory of the Persian Empire, so court dress retained very strong elements of traditional dress.|$|E

500|$|In 1936 London Films {{released}} Things to Come, {{in which}} Richardson played the swaggering warlord [...] "The Boss". His performance parodied the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini so effectively {{that the film}} was immediately banned in Italy. The producer was Alexander Korda; the two men formed a long and mutually beneficial friendship. Richardson later said of Korda, [...] "Though <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> much older than I am, I regarded {{him in a way}} as a father, and to me he was as generous as a prince." [...] In May 1936 Richardson and Olivier jointly directed and starred in a new piece by Priestley, Bees on the Boatdeck. Both actors won excellent notices, but the play, an allegory of Britain's decline, did not attract the public. It closed after four weeks, the last in a succession of West End productions in which Richardson appeared to much acclaim but which were box-office failures. In August of the same year he finally had a long-running star part, the title role in Barr√© Lyndon's comedy thriller, The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse, which played for 492 performances, closing in October 1937.|$|E
500|$|The {{ground work}} for his successes had {{certainly}} been laid by others: Michael III, {{who broke the}} power of Melitene at Lalakaon; Basil I, who destroyed the Paulicians; Leo VI the Wise, who founded the vital theme of Mesopotamia; and Empress Zoe, who extended Byzantine influence again into Armenia and founded the theme of Lykandos. It was Kourkouas and his campaigns, however, that incontrovertibly changed {{the balance of power}} in the northern Middle East, securing the frontier provinces against Arab raids and turning Byzantium into an expansionist power. In the words of historian Steven Runciman, [...] "a lesser general might [...] have cleared the Empire of the Saracens and successfully defended its borders; but [...] did more. He infused a new spirit into the imperial armies, and led them victoriously deep into the country of the infidels. The actual area of his conquests was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> large; but they sufficed to reverse the age-old roles of Byzantium and the Arabs. Byzantium now was the aggressor... was the first of a line of great conquerors and as the first is worthy of high praise." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> {{long ago}} our nation tolerated slavery in our colonies. Philanthropists {{endeavored}} to destroy slavery; but when was it utterly abolished? It was when Wilberforce roused {{the church of}} God, and when the church of God addressed herself to the conflict, then she tore the evil thing to pieces. I have been amused with what Wilberforce said the day after they passed the Act of Emancipation. He merrily said to a friend {{when it was all}} done, [...] "Is there not something else we can abolish?" [...] That was said playfully, but it shows the spirit of the church of God. She lives in conflict and victory; her mission is to destroy everything that is bad in the land.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah! my dear, {{that does}} <b>not</b> seem <b>so</b> <b>very</b> long ago. Time passes very quickly. To think {{of such a}} great girl as you being poor James's grandchild!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, dearest mamma," [...] {{answered}} Violet, laughing {{to think}} that her mother did <b>not</b> comprehend <b>so</b> <b>very</b> plain an affair, [...] "this is our little snow-sister whom we have just been making!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know we are}} <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> old, Dora, but, on {{the other}} hand, we are <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> young either, and I think your mother would approve, and I am sure my father wouldn't object. I know he thinks you are just the finest girl in the whole world,--he said so." ...|$|E

60|$|JOB ARTHUR. Yes, sir. Perhaps you see now why you're <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> popular, Mr. Gerald.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{very kind}} of you," [...] said Herbert. [...] "But the blow has fallen, and as for myself, I believe that I can bear it. I do <b>not</b> care <b>so</b> <b>very</b> much about the property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{hope he does}} <b>not</b> look <b>so</b> <b>very</b> ill,' said Genevieve, cheerfully, {{but this}} rather hurt the {{feelings}} of both; the one said, 'Oh! but he is terribly pale,' the other coughed, and said, 'Looks are deceitful.' ...|$|R
60|$|Bloody, dirty, ragged and {{wringing}} {{wet with}} sweat I {{must have been}} a sight. R.C. however, did <b>not</b> look <b>so</b> <b>very</b> immaculate, and when I saw he also was lame and scratched and black I felt better.|$|R
6000|$|... "She will be {{his wife}} if you don't upset her notion that she's bound to accept him as an {{understood}} thing," [...] said Mrs. Melbury. [...] "Bless ye, she'll soon shake down here in Hintock, and be content with Giles's way of living, which he'll improve with what money she'll have from you. 'Tis the strangeness after her genteel life that makes her feel uncomfortable at first. Why, when I saw Hintock the first time I thought I never could like it. But things gradually get familiar, and stone floors seem <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> cold and hard, and the hooting of the owls <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> dreadful, and loneliness <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> lonely, after a while." ...|$|E
60|$|You know, {{the things}} didn't look so bad, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> bad--as {{long as they}} were new.|$|E
60|$|VERNON. Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, all right, we'll stop at home. I'm <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> keen about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're <b>not</b> grown <b>so</b> <b>very</b> tall, Miss Jane, nor <b>so</b> <b>very</b> stout," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Leaven. [...] "I {{dare say}} they've not kept you too well at school: Miss Reed {{is the head}} and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We must {{consider}} of that,' said Aunt Jane. 'There will hardly {{be time to}} hear from Lilias before the next term begins. Indeed, it will <b>not</b> be <b>so</b> <b>very</b> long to wait before the happy return, I hope.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Celia," [...] said Dorothea, entreatingly, [...] "you {{distress}} me. Tell me at once {{what you}} mean." [...] It glanced {{through her mind}} that Mr. Casaubon had left the property away from her--which would <b>not</b> be <b>so</b> <b>very</b> distressing.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with uplifted eyebrows--a look of {{whimsical}} incredulity. Sir John felt that after all forty-five was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> old.|$|E
6000|$|... "West Nazareth," [...] said Miss Garland, {{with her}} usual sobriety. [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> little, though it 's smaller than Northampton." ...|$|E
60|$|This was {{alarming}} enough. Charlottetown was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> {{far away}} and considerable traffic went on {{between it and the}} north shore districts.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come, {{you must}} <b>not</b> be <b>so</b> <b>very</b> severe and dignified. Make some {{allowance}} for poor things who don't {{know how to}} answer Mrs. Nesbit, and say what first occurs. Indeed, I did not know you were so much interested in him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>not</b> look <b>so</b> <b>very</b> much surprised," [...] she said, in {{her sweet}} {{pleading}} way. [...] "May I not be supposed {{able to feel}} that noble kindness and gracious manner, and be glad to have some one to look up to?" ...|$|R
60|$|Still {{he would}} not, or could <b>not</b> rise, <b>so</b> <b>very</b> slowly {{she bent over}} him and touched him with her lips upon the brow. Next she beckoned to me. I came and would have knelt also, but she {{suffered}} it not.|$|R
60|$|Her air confessed {{more than}} her words. 'I am <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> glad that I am going to the Hunt Ball,' she replied confidentially.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--well! We are {{not going}} so very far. <b>Not</b> <b>so</b> <b>very</b> far. Perhaps we shall see each other another day. It may be. Good-bye!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. J. (laughing).--Why don't {{you marry}} her, Botter? Shall I speak to her? I dare say she'd have you. You're <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>VERY</b> old.|$|E
60|$|As he roars it Amy peeps in anxiously. She {{is in her}} nightgown, and {{her hair}} is down and her feet are bare, and she does <b>not</b> look <b>so</b> <b>very</b> much more than five. Alice is unable to resist the temptation.|$|R
6000|$|Page 167. [...] "The Pope {{and other}} great Church dons." [...] I suppose, he meaneth bishops: But I wish, he would explain himself, and <b>not</b> be <b>so</b> <b>very</b> witty {{in the midst}} of an argument; it is like two mediums; not fair in disputing.|$|R
6000|$|... "No hope! Why {{should there}} not be hope? All her life need {{not depend on}} her fancy {{for a man of}} whom after all she has <b>not</b> seen <b>so</b> <b>very</b> much. She must get over it. Other girls have had to do the same." ...|$|R
