40|$|The article {{describes}} the results of two surveys conducted in six villages in the Ashanti region of Ghana.  The first was undertaken in August 2002 and the second during July 2004.  A total of 468 hunters and non-hunters were surveyed using targeted and systematic interviewing techniques.  The results indicate that hunting is an important contributor to total income in the villages, particularly for poorer households.  We find some evidence that hunting increases during lean periods, especially for hunters in the household survey.  Distance to Kumasi is a significant determinant of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>sold</b> on the market, and also influences the type of gear used for hunting.  Compliance with wildlife laws, notably species restrictions and the closed season is low, particularly amongst professional hunters...|$|E
40|$|Summary- An ethnozoological {{research}} was conducted in the Haut-Ogooué Province, a poorly studied area of SE Gabon, to collect information on subsistence hunting activities. Specifi c aims {{of the study were}} to describe the hunting activities of local rural people and to gather information on game harvest. Th is kind of information is useful to both assess the human impact on wild mammals and better comprehend the livelihood strategies of local people. Seven villages within the study area were regularly visited, collecting information on the number of mammals killed, the hunting techniques used, and the prey destination (direct consumption by the hunter or bushmeat trade). During the study period, 432 mammals, belonging to 14 species were captured. Th e data collected evidenced that most of the animals captured were ungulates (57. 3 %) and rodents (26. 4 %), and that two species, i. e. the blue duiker and the brush-tailed porcupine, represented by themselves {{more than half of the}} entire off-take (58. 5 %). No signifi cant correlation was detected between the off-take and the village size. Local hunters adopted three diff erent hunting techniques: guns (86. 1 % of hunters), nets (10. 4 %) and traps (1. 6 %), evidencing a larger use of fi re weapons rather than traditional netting and trapping techniques; however, the off-take was not correlated to the number of guns detected in each village surveyed. Bushmeat trade resulted important for local hunters since only a slightly higher percentage of animals (56 %) was directly consumed at household level, while the remainder was sold. Th e bushmeat traffi c, defi ned as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>sold,</b> was not correlated to the size of villages and to the distance of each village surveyed to the main nearest market, i. e. the town of Franceville...|$|E

40|$|A {{financial}} {{analysis was performed}} to assess the performance of three acaricide-treatment groups of indigenous breeds (Zebu and Nganda) of cattle on a ranch in Luwero District, Uganda. The treatments were based on different frequencies: twice-a-week dipping, once-a-month dipping and no tick control. The objective was to evaluate the economic justification for intensive acaricide application for tick and tick-borne disease control in Uganda. Data were collected by monitoring cattle performance {{over a period of}} 34 months. Biological data collected included the number of cows {{at the beginning and end}} of the study, net starting liveweight, number of calves born, number of animals dying due to tick-borne diseases and other causes, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>sold</b> or slaughtered and milk yield. Records of variable costs (acaricides, drugs, labour, etc.) and output prices were assembled and calculated by treatment group. Gross margin and marginal analysis were used in the {{financial analysis}}. The exchange rate in 1990 - 1993 was one US$ to 1200 Uganda shillings. The gross benefits obtained from animal sales, herd value and milk yield were Uganda shillings 1175, 1389 and 1311 per kg of net starting liveweight for animals dipped twice-a-week, once-a-month and not dipped, respectively. The variable costs were Ug. shs. 424, 390 and 360 per kg of net starting liveweight, respectively. Consequently, the gross margins were Ug. shs. 751, 999 and 951 per kg of net starting liveweight. Furthermore, the marginal rate of return (MRR) in changing from no tick control to once-a-month dipping was 160 %, while changing from no tick control to twice-a-week dipping was negative (- 313 %). The above results showed that the value of increased gains in production obtained from twice-a-week dipping strategy does not offset the costs of inputs for intensive dipping. Once-a-month dipping (strategic) therefore appears to be the most-profitable tick-control strategy for the farmer. The need to conduct further studies in different livestock- production systems and to rationalise future tick control policies is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to compare {{centrality}} and other measures of bovine movement networks in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, in 2007, by examination of the positive and negative herds identified in the brucellosis survey conducted in 2003. In addition, we aimed to examine the association between herd size (measured by the number of females older than 24 months, denoted FEM 24 +) and animal trade between herds. We found a statistical association between brucellosis occurrence and both the total degree (number of traded animals) and out-degree (for the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>sold</b> and the number of neighboring herds). This finding suggests that positive herds in the 2003 survey were trading (particularly selling) more frequently in 2007 than negative herds, thereby presumably increasing the risk of disease spread. Statistical differences observed (p-values) in the network of movements for reproduction purposes were more significant than those observed in other networks for average herd size; degrees of animals, batches, and neighbors; outdegree of neighbors; and betweenness. We found positive associations (p 50 FEM 24 +), within the network of movements for reproduction purposes, revealed significant differences (p 50 FEM 24 + category only, for average herd size, total degree (animals, batches, and neighbors), outdegree (animals, batches, and neighbors), and outcloseness. Logistic regression analysis, in which average herd size and degree (animals) were both factors, showed that a tenfold increase in herd size and the number of animals traded would lead to an increased chance of a herd being positive by 41 % (OR = 1. 41 [1. 01; 1. 99]) and 39 % (OR = 1. 39 [1. 05; 1. 85]), respectively. We concluded that the presence of bovine brucellosis is associated with a larger herd size, which is consistent with other reports. We also found an association between the increased trade of bovines and the presence of bovine brucellosis. Furthermore, an association was noted between herd size and animal trade, both of which could contribute to the spread of brucellosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of goats and palm oil plantation is prospective agricultural production systems that exploit the complement relationship among various {{components in the}} system. The main components are the oil palm trees, vegetation underneath the trees, processing plant of palm oil bunch, and the goat. The estimation of carrying capacity of the plantation system {{is based on the}} quantitative analysis on nutrient supply from various feed resources in the plantation system and nutrient requirements for goat production. The goat demographic parameters, such as, prolificacy, fertility and fecundity are used to estimate the goat population size, dynamics and structures. The development of production model could be based on a certain production target, such as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>sold</b> or the amount of income (demand driven approach), or based on the availability of certain resources such as feed supply (supply driven approach). Using the demand driven approach, and considering 6000 heads of oneyear old goats to fill the Malaysian market as the production target, it is calculated that a population size of 3, 636 does and 810 ha of palm oil plantation are required to meet this production target. In a typically medium-size oil palm plantation system (500 ha of oil palm plantation) with one unit of small-scale palm oil bunch processing plant (l ton/hour), the potency to supply metabolisable energy from various feed resources in the system is 2, 778, 800 Mcal/year, equivalent to a carrying capacity of 5, 155 Goat Units/year. This system could carry 2, 951 does and 295 bucks to produce 1, 116 heads of one-year old goats annually. A medium-size oil palm plantation without processing plant unit, is potential in supplying metabolisable energy of 1, 983, 300 Mcal/year, equivalent to a carrying capacity of 3, 680 Goat Units/year. In order to fill the export market to Malaysia, a number of 10 units of medium sized plantation with small scale plant processing or a number of 17 units medium scale plantation without processing unit are required. Using similar approach, the potential of either large-scale or small-scale plantation system to produce goat in an integrated-production system could be estimated. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the level of awareness of the informal indigenous livestock grading and pricing system among producers and the exploitation of this knowledge to increase market participation and realise better prices and returns for their animals. Data was collected from 144 small ruminant producers in 3 livelihood zones (West Golis pastoral, Togdheer agro-pastoral and Hawd pastoral regions) in the northern Togdheer region using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and econometric methods {{were used in the}} analysis of data. Results confirmed the importance of small ruminants as sources of income among livestock producers in Somaliland. On average, a household kept 53 sheep and goats with most of the producers (79 - 85 %) having sold some animals (mean= 10) during the preceding 12 months. It was also established that producers were generally well versed with the grading and pricing system except for the very fine details. However, this knowledge did not have significant effect on level of market participation, but rather, other supply influencing factors like the number of animals kept by the household, gender of sales decision maker, age of household head and livelihood zone in which the household resided significantly influenced household annual small ruminants sales volumes. Despite level of awareness of grading and pricing having no significant effect on the absolute annual household sales volumes due to other adjunct supply constraints, producers tended to avail more of the superior quality grades for sale. For example, Grades I and II of small ruminants accounted for the largest proportions of animals sold (40 % and 29 %, respectively) with inferior quality grades (grade III and the local grade) accounting for only 15 % and 17 % respectively. Furthermore, results of an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression showed that supply of higher grade animals had a positive effect on prices received. In addition, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>sold</b> and involvement in other economic activities besides livestock production positively affected the level of prices received by producers. Although a significant number of producers (39 %) said that they deliberately fatten animals before sale, the strategy employed simply involved grazing of animals in communal land during the rainy season. Sheep and goats producers in Somalia face formidable constraints of drought and the attendant lack of feed and water for livestock, and also animal health issues. This provides a justification for development agencies and research organisations to continue working to address these problems. Danish International Development Agenc...|$|E
