25|$|Several NTP server misuse {{and abuse}} {{practices}} exist which cause damage or degradation to a <b>Network</b> <b>Time</b> Protocol (NTP) server.|$|E
25|$|<b>Network</b> <b>Time</b> Protocol (NTP) is a {{networking}} {{protocol for}} clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP {{is one of}} the oldest Internet protocols in current use. NTP was designed by David L. Mills of the University of Delaware.|$|E
25|$|A {{less complex}} {{implementation}} of NTP, {{using the same}} protocol but without requiring the storage of state over extended periods of time, {{is known as the}} Simple <b>Network</b> <b>Time</b> Protocol (SNTP). It is used in some embedded devices and in applications where full NTP capability is not required.|$|E

25|$|Also on August 14, 2006, UPN {{discontinued}} all promotional {{advertising for}} its programs during <b>network</b> <b>time</b> periods (except for audition promotions for America's Next Top Model that aired during that program), though some local stations still aired promos for the network's shows. The network also stopped customizing the closing credits of its shows to the network's standardized graphics scheme (perhaps {{in reaction to}} affiliate preemptions, see below), instead showing the program's studio credits full-screen with theme music intact (save for ANTM, where previews for the next episode and casting calls for future CW cycles were shown {{on the left side}} of the screen with the studio credits on the right). In contrast, at The WB, advertising for its shows continued during <b>network</b> <b>time</b> periods, with promos for The CW mixed in, and the network's standard closing credits format remained unchanged with promos in the upper two-thirds of the screen and credits in the lower third.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{verification of}} safety properties for parameterized systems of timed processes, so called <b>timed</b> <b>networks.</b> A <b>timed</b> <b>network</b> {{consists of a}} finite state process, called a controller, and an arbitrary set of identical timed processes. In [Parosh Aziz Abdulla and Bengt Jonsson. Model checking of systems with many identical timed processes. Theoretical Computer Science, 290 (1) : 241 – 264, 2003] it was shown that checking safety properties is decidable in the case where each timed process {{is equipped with a}} single real-valued clock. In [P. Abdulla, J. Deneux, and P. Mahata. Multi-clock <b>timed</b> <b>networks.</b> In Proc. LICS' 04, pages 345 – 354. IEEE Computer Society Press, 2004], we showed that this is no longer possible if each timed process is equipped with at least two real-valued clocks. In this paper, we study two subclasses of timed networks: closed and open <b>timed</b> <b>networks.</b> In closed <b>timed</b> <b>networks,</b> all clock constraints are non-strict, while in open <b>timed</b> <b>networks,</b> all clock constraints are strict (thus corresponds to syntactic removal of equality testing). We show that the problem becomes decidable for closed <b>timed</b> <b>network,</b> while it remains undecidable for open <b>timed</b> <b>networks.</b> We also consider robust semantics of <b>timed</b> <b>networks</b> by introducing timing fuzziness through semantic removal of equality testing. We show that the problem is undecidable both for closed and open <b>timed</b> <b>networks</b> under the robust semantics...|$|R
25|$|None of {{the current}} Raspberry Pi models have a {{built-in}} real-time clock, so {{they are unable to}} keep track of the time of day independently. As a workaround, a program running on the Pi can retrieve the time from a <b>network</b> <b>time</b> server or from user input at boot time, thus knowing the time while powered on. To provide consistency of time for the file system, the Pi does automatically save the time it has on shutdown, and re-installs that time at boot.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, HBO created The Comedy Channel, a basic {{cable channel}} that {{featured}} clips excerpted from stand-up comedy sets, comedic feature films and television series (using a programming model {{similar to the}} original format of MTV), which launched on November 15 of that year. The channel competed with another startup comedy-oriented cable channel that debuted the following year, Viacom-owned , which focused on reruns of older network sitcoms. Both channels suffered from insufficient cable carriage (both Ha! and The Comedy Channel each had fewer than 10 million subscribers). This resulted in Viacom and HBO reaching an agreement to merge Ha! and The Comedy Channel into a single channel called CTV: The Comedy Network, which debuted on April 1, 1991; the channel subsequently changed its name three months later to Comedy Central due to confusion and potential legal issues with Canadian broadcaster, the CTV Television <b>Network.</b> <b>Time</b> Warner/HBO exited the venture when Viacom bought out its 50% stake in Comedy Central for $1.23 billion in April 2003.|$|E
25|$|Arguments {{against the}} {{proposal}} include the unknown expense {{of such a}} major change {{and the fact that}} universal time will no longer correspond to mean solar time. It is also answered that two timescales that do not follow leap seconds are already available, International Atomic Time (TAI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) time. Computers, for example, could use these and convert to UTC or local civil time as necessary for output. Inexpensive GPS timing receivers are readily available, and the satellite broadcasts include the necessary information to convert GPS time to UTC. It is also easy to convert GPS time to TAI, as TAI is always exactly 19 seconds ahead of GPS time. Examples of systems based on GPS time include the CDMA digital cellular systems IS-95 and CDMA2000. In general, computer systems use UTC and synchronize their clocks using <b>Network</b> <b>Time</b> Protocol (NTP). Systems that cannot tolerate disruptions caused by leap seconds can base their time on TAI and use Precision Time Protocol. However, the BIPM has pointed out that this proliferation of timescales leads to confusion.|$|E

40|$|This paper formulates {{the problem}} of {{learning}} discriminative features (i. e., segments) from <b>networked</b> <b>time</b> series data considering the linked information among time series. For example, social network users {{are considered to be}} social sensors that continuously generate social signals (tweets) represented as a time series. The discriminative segments are often referred to as shapelets in a time series. Extracting shapelets for time series classification has been widely studied. However, existing works on shapelet selection assume that the time series are independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.). This assumption restricts their applications to social <b>networked</b> <b>time</b> series analysis, since a user's actions can be correlated to his/her social affiliations. In this paper we propose a new Network Regularized Least Squares (NetRLS) feature selection model that combines typical time series data and user network data for analysis. Experiments on real-world <b>networked</b> <b>time</b> series Twitter and DBLP data demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. NetRLS performs better than LTS, the state-of-the-art time series feature selection approach, on real-world data. Comment: submitted to a blind review journa...|$|R
40|$|In a {{personal}} communications services (PCS) network, the network delay for a hand-off request {{is limited by}} a timeout period. If the network fails to respond within the timeout period, the hand-off call is forced terminated. We study {{the effect of the}} <b>network</b> response <b>time</b> on the performance (the call incompletion probability) of a PCS network. Our study indicates that at a small offered load, the <b>network</b> response <b>time</b> has a significant effect on the call incompletion probability. At a large offered load, the poor performance due to slow <b>network</b> response <b>time</b> can be compensated by increasing the number of radio channels. We also observe that the effect of the <b>network</b> response <b>time</b> is more significant if the portable residual time distribution at a port coverage area has a smaller variance. Thus, the design of the <b>network</b> hand-off <b>time</b> objective should consider the movement behavior of the PCS users. 1 Contact author: Professor Yi-Bing Lin, Dept. Comp. Sci. & Info.

25|$|CBS had a thirteen-month {{leeway to}} find a new Dallas-Fort Worth affiliate, as its {{contract}} with KDFW did not expire until July 1, 1995; the affiliation contracts for KTBC and KTVI expired around the same time, giving the networks that were already affiliated with the three former Argyle stations slated to switch to Fox a longer grace period to find new affiliates than CBS, NBC and/or ABC were given in most of the other markets affected by the Fox-New World deal (ABC's affiliation contracts with WGHP and WBRC ended even later, respectively expiring in September 1995 and September 1996). CBS first approached longtime NBC affiliate KXAS-TV about negotiating an affiliation deal, ultimately to be turned down by its then-owner LIN Broadcasting; WFAA was eliminated as an option as ABC reached a new long-term agreement with then-owner of the station, Belo, to extend affiliation contracts for WFAA and other Belo-owned stations that were affiliated with the network. This left KTVT as CBS's only viable option among the Metroplex's VHF television stations, particularly as it was the only other English language station in the market that had a news department (at the time, KTVT had been producing a prime time newscast, which debuted in 1990). On September 14, 1994, Gaylord Broadcasting reached an agreement to affiliate KTVT with CBS, in exchange for also switching its sister independent station in Tacoma, Washington, KSTW (now a CW owned-and-operated station), to the <b>network</b> (<b>Time</b> Warner would later file an injunction attempting to dissolve a previous agreement with Gaylord to turn KTVT, KSTW and KHTV (now CW affiliate KIAH) in Houston into charter affiliates of The WB at that network's launch in January 1995).|$|E

WABC agreed to do this and when the new season launched that fall, the station began airing Millionaire at 12:30 pm. Millionaire continued to air on WABC in the afternoon {{until the end of the}} 2014–15 season, when it acquired the broadcast rights to FABLife for the 2015–16 season. To make room for FABLife, the afternoon airing of Millionaire was moved to independent station WLNY-TV; however, FABLife was canceled in January 2016, and as a result, Millionaire moved back to WABC for the 2016–17 season.|$|E
