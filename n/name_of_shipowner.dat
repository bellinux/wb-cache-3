50|$|The Responsibility <b>of</b> <b>Shipowners</b> Act 1733 (7 Geo. II, c.15) was an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of Great Britain {{passed in}} 1734. The Act was {{introduced}} {{for the protection}} <b>of</b> <b>shipowners,</b> following a petition presented to the House of Commons, and passed without a division in either House. It imposed a limit on the liability <b>of</b> <b>shipowners</b> in regards to goods embezzled by the master or crew of the ship carrying them. The liability for any loss or damage of goods {{was limited to the}} value of the vessel, her equipment, and any freight due for the voyage. The Act was held to apply in the case of Sutton v. Mitchell, (1785) 1 T.R. 18, where goods were stolen from a ship moored in the Thames by robbers colluding with a member of the crew. However, this emphasised the liability shipowners were still exposed to in cases where the goods were stolen without the involvement of the crew; as a result, a second petition was brought to the House, leading to the passage of the Merchant Shipping Act 1786.|$|R

50|$|The Act {{stemmed from}} a {{petition}} made to Parliament by a delegation <b>of</b> <b>shipowners</b> in 1786, concerned that recent court cases had put them at risk of significantly greater liabilities in case of loss or damage to cargo. It was passed by Parliament without a division in either House. Section I of the Act imposed a limit on the liability <b>of</b> <b>shipowners</b> in regards to goods lost or damaged in a robbery, {{regardless of whether the}} robbers were part of the crew of the ship or not. The liability for any loss or damage of goods was limited to the value of the vessel, her equipment, and any freight due for the voyage. This was an extension to the provisions of the Responsibility <b>of</b> <b>Shipowners</b> Act 1733, as the case of Sutton v. Mitchell, (1785) 1 T.R. 18, had highlighted that the 1733 Act would give no protection to shipowners where a ship was robbed without the collusion of the crew. Section II provided that the liability of the owner in case of fire was entirely removed, a reaction to Forward v. Pittard, (1785) I T.R. 27, where a shipowner had been held liable for loss from an accidental fire. Section III provided that the shipowner was under no liability at all in the case of stolen valuables (gold, silver, jewels, watches, etc.) unless the bill of lading clearly stated their nature, quality and value.|$|R
