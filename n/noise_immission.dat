A single source will create a certain level of immission primarily driven by originating sound power level and distance influenced by e.g. absorption and reflection. Several noise sources result in typically higher levels of immission. The method or process of determining the resulting immission level is called noise calculation, its graphical representation is called noise map.|$|E

In several countries standards or guidelines on how to measure <b>noise</b> <b>immission</b> from industrial sources have been implemented. However, it is, in general, not possible to apply the procedures specified in these documents to wind turbine acoustic measurements since they must be carried out in windy conditions outside the scope of the standards dealing with noise from industrial plants.

Whereas the general {{meaning of the}} term en route might be intuitively understood, it is suggested that a precise formal definition of the term en route would be opportune from the outset, especially since the scientific and technical investigation of the problem of <b>noise</b> <b>immissions</b> on the ground from aircraft in flight away from the airspace of an airport may conceivably lead to administrative, regulatory, and legal consequences that would mandatorily require a precise definition of the term en route. Five flight segments, with their differing airframe configurations, engine thrusts, and airspeed management, should form the basis for the differential consideration of the <b>noise</b> <b>immissions</b> perceived on the ground underneath or near the defined segments of the flightpath in en route flight, {{from the end of the}} initial climb from an airport after takeoff until the final approach to an airport...|$|R
40|$|With the {{utilisation}} {{of offshore}} wind energy {{a new source of}} underwater noise is brought into the marine environment. Operating wind energy converters (WEC) will give rise for a change in the acoustic back-ground regime on quite a low but long lasting level. Furthermore during the installation phase the hydro sound might even exceed the threshold of “only disturbing ” and in the worst case might cause a persistent damage to marine animals. In order to prevent unacceptable impacts on offshore nature, several studies have been started to investigate how marine animals, with the main focus on marine mammals, are effect-ed even by small additional acoustic immission. This report will summarise the results of a technical study, that has been launched (financed by the German Ministry of Environment) to clarify what levels of acoustic noise can be expected by offshore wind turbines and their installation, how underwater sound can be meas-ured and evaluated in a comparable way, and what acoustic parameters should be focused on. When the study has been started in 2002 neither a threshold for acoustic <b>noise</b> <b>immissions</b> nor standards for measurements and evaluations had been defined. Within this work the data basis of offshore noises has been extended significantly and preliminary measuring procedures have been published within the final report of the first project phase. In order to allow an estimation of <b>noise</b> <b>immissions</b> already in the planning phase of a wind park, appropriate prediction methods have been tested and compared with the results of the measurements. In addition a working party has been founded to exchange information with biologists, the regulatory authority, the ministry of environment and acoustic experts...|$|R
40|$|This keynote {{introduces}} various {{contributions to}} a structured session on sound quality {{organized by the}} present author. In the last decade, basic research as well as practical applications of sound quality increased substantially. This holds true for sound quality of emissions e. g. in product sound {{as well as for}} sound quality of immissions e. g. in the environment. For product sound, two cases of sound quality are considered: one, where sound quality is the dominant, generic feature of a product like musical instruments or loudspeakers, and a second, where sound quality is a by-product like the sound of Dieselengines or- to give a more exotic example- the sound quality of snoring. As concerns sound immissions, wanted sounds typical for a soundscape and unwanted sounds typical for <b>noise</b> <b>immissions</b> can be distinguished. However, also sounds blending perfectly into a soundscape like the noise of a chain saw in the soundscape of a forest, may be pretty annoying. For both product sound and sound quality of the environment, influences of the meaning of sounds have to be considered. Additional extra-aural effects like the image of brand names or audio-visual interactions can significantly influence sound quality judgements. ...|$|R

Since then both I-INCE and the congresses have evolved to become the world’s leading sources of technology solutions in the expanding field of noise control engineering with more than 15, 000 papers in the congress series and more than 1, 000 articles published in Noise Control Engineering Journal. This year we celebrate the 40 th INTER-NOISE congress. The roles of <b>noise</b> <b>immission</b> effects and noise emission control have now been clarified. Both approaches {{to the problem of}} excessive noise have merit and can be most effective when used together. Of the major economic powers, Japan has had the most notable success in combining <b>noise</b> <b>immission</b> guidelines with noise emission regulatory requirements. The International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences (CAETS) initiated a noise policy project in 2007. The principal objective of the project is to assist the world’s policymakers in improving national and international requirements in noise policies. Emphasis is placed on the need for substantial reductions in the noise emissions of the world’s dominant noise sources. The CAETS project provides independent information about the technological options and barriers to balance the lobbying from industry. In three CAETS fora (in 2008, 2009, and 2010) the existing technology for quieter sources has been assessed.

40|$|Without any doubt, the noxa "noise" {{brings about}} {{economically}} measurable {{damage to the}} health and performance of people concerned. In 2004, more than 30 % of the population in the Federal State of Baden-Württemberg felt annoyed by traffic noise and almost 20 % by aircraft noise. Noise emitted from industrial plants and leisure time facilities must still be added to these noise sources. So far, the individual types of noise sources were considered separately. Requirements, calculation and measurement methods are available for the respective types of noise. The impact of the individual types of noise, however, cannot be taken into consideration separately but must be integrally assessed as a totality of noise sources. For example, <b>noise</b> <b>immissions</b> caused by traffic, industry and leisure time facilities may not be annoying as a single noise source, the totality of noise sources, however, is assessed as especially disturbing. An extensive survey of models to consider the totality of noise sources is given in. Therefore the objective of this project is to create a usable tool allowing the auralization and explanation of simultaneous and different sound immissions (e. g. traffic, railway, industry, leisure time facilities) and the impact of different adjusted noise reduction measures (noise barriers and noise control windows, silencers).

The far field noise of both the propeller and the engine exhaust is characterised by periodic sound pressure fluctuations; by generating a suitable phase shift between these two periodic sound-fields, a destructive interference may be attained, resulting in a reduced overall <b>noise</b> level <b>immission</b> on the ground.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of the EU noise policy is mapping of noise and noise effects and the formulation of noise action plans. In the Netherlands, due to the new policy on noise (MIG), the municipalities will be responsible for the formulation of a local noise policy.

40|$|Noise {{from wind}} {{turbines}} {{is of concern}} in the planning process of new wind farms, and accurate estimations of <b>immission</b> <b>noise</b> levels at residents nearby are required. Sound propagation from wind turbine to receiver could be modelled by a simplified standard model assuming constant meteorological conditions, by an engineering method taking atmospheric and ground propagation conditions into account, or by a more exact model. Epidemiological studies have found a higher frequency of annoyance due to wind turbine noise than to other community noise sources at equal noise levels, indicating that the often used simplified model is not sufficient. This paper evaluates the variation of immission sound levels {{under the influence of}} meteorological variation and explores if the prediction of levels could be improved by taking the effect of wind speed on sound propagation into account. Long-term sound recordings and measurements at a distance of 530 m from a wind turbine show that the simplified standard model predicts the average sound pressure levels satisfactorily under downwind conditions, and that a more complex propagation model might not be needed for wind turbine noise at a relatively short distance. Large variations of sound immission levels at the same wind speed were however present. Statistical analysis revealed that these variations were influenced by meteorological parameters, such as temperature, static pressure and deviation from ideal downwind direction. The overall results indicate that meteorological factors influence the noise generated by the wind turbine rather than the sound propagation...|$|R
40|$|In {{developed}} countries noise annoyance {{is an important}} source of environmental concern. Research on noise annoyance caused by railroad traffic is relatively underdeveloped. Here, a causal chain model is presented in which railroad traffic density, noise emission, <b>noise</b> <b>immission</b> and noise annoyance are causally related. Noise level, habituation and railroad usage are determinant factors. Noise annoyance causes social and economic costs, such as property value depreciation. Policy measures, aimed at reducing social and economic costs, are incorporated in various stages of the causal model. These measures can be subdivided into noise regulation and direct prevention measures. Stricter threshold values lead to higher total costs, but may lower social costs per capita. Economic feasibility of policy measures is usually analyzed by means of a cost-benefit case study. Methods of analysis used are diverse and ad hoc.

40|$|Abstract—The {{relationship}} between noise exposure and hearing loss {{was investigated in}} five groups of industrial workers in Hong Kong. Audiometric examinations were made on textile weavers, textile spinners, metal workers, aircraft maintenance crews and workers in a bottling factory. Noise surveys were conducted {{in each of the}} work environments. Audiometric examinations were also made on a control group consisting of workers in 'non-noisy ' occupations. The results were compared with data obtained from similar studies made in Western countries. In general, the results were similar and no evidence was found for any ethnic differences between Western groups and Cantonese Chinese either in general hearing levels or in response to prolonged exposure to industrial noise. Measured hearing loss was plotted against <b>noise</b> <b>immission</b> levels for four groups of workers and compared with median and quartile values predicted by ROBINSON and SHIPTON (1977). The agreement between the predicted curves and observed data was reasonably good for spinning workers and workers in the weaving and bottling industries, but hearing loss of workers in the metal-work industry tended to be greater than that predicted.

Local or regional urban planning guidelines and anti-noise-manuals provide experienced and practical advice to reduce noise, in order to provide a better quality of life. Most of the anticipated solutions such as noise-protection-walls, fences, planted mounds etc. will address issues caused by land traffic. However, due to their nature, they fail to respond to "airborne" <b>noise</b> <b>immission.</b> In addition, there is a common public misconception that sound should be interpreted as noise ie. as a waste to get rid of, instead of critically identifying sound and sound clusters as a potential and as a resource to be integrated. The concept of the sound-absorbing city applies the same principles of sound reflection and sound absorption, as applied to an architectural space, in an urban space. It also investigates the possibility of combining unwanted sound, such as air traffic noise with wanted sound, such as nature and community sound. The paper discusses the concept of the sound-absorbing city, its potentials and its apparent limits, with regard to new settlements and existing agglomerations around airports...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the start}} of the {{operation}} of a 30 MW, 17 turbine wind park, residents living 500 in and more from the park have reacted strongly to the noise; residents up to 1900 in distance expressed annoyance. To assess actual sound immission, long term measurements (a total of over 400 night hours in 4 months) have been performed at 400 and 1500 in from the park. In the original sound assessment a fixed relation between wind speed at reference height (10 in) and hub height (98 in) had been used. However, measurements show that the wind speed at hub height at night is up to 2. 6 times higher than expected, causing a higher rotational speed of the wind turbines and consequentially up to 15 dB higher sound levels, relative to the same reference wind speed in daytime. Moreover, especially at high rotational speeds the turbines produce a 'thumping', impulsive sound, increasing annoyance further. It is concluded that prediction of <b>noise</b> <b>immission</b> at night from (tall) wind turbines is underestimated when measurement data are used (implicitly) assuming a wind profile valid in daytime.

40|$|Outdoor sound {{propagation}} {{with and without}} screening obstacles was investigated for elevated sound sources. Particularly the insertion loss of high buildings in industrial plants was measured for source heights up to 30 m and distances up to 1000 m. Procedures are proposed for calculation of the sound velocity profile directly from acoustic measurements. Thus a separate assessment of meteorological parameters becomes superfluous, {{and it is possible}} to deduce from the actual acoustic measurement a prediction of <b>noise</b> <b>immission</b> levels for other weather conditions. A new formula for the prediction of insertion loss gives better agreement with measured data than the prediction schemes of the German guidelines VDI 2720. It is possible to take actual data of wind- and temperature-profiles into account in the correction for the weather conditions. Alternatively, a standard profile for downwind condition is proposed. Measurements of the meteorological and ground effect corrections for the open field propagation from elevated sources (up to 20 m) show such systematic deviations from the predictions of the German guide line VD 12714, that further investigations of meteorological and ground effects are necessary.

40|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>immission</b> level depends {{not only}} on the sound power level of noise source(s) but also the {{associated}} propagation attenuation, which in turn depends on the distance, the source height(s), the receiver height, the terrain profile, the ground impedance(s), and the weather conditions. To collect all these information for determining the propagation attenuation will lead to a complicated measurement procedure, which is desired to simplify. In the European Imagine project we propose a practical method to determine the sound power of railway rolling noise using one-microphone recordings. Using a standard measurement position (7. 5 m from the track centre and 1. 2 m above railhead) the time history of the sound pressure level of a train passage will be recorded. When choosing the special time interval Tp and calculating the equivalent sound pressure level for this time period, the corresponding sound power level can easily be obtained by using the tabled constants. Applying this method to determine the sound power level one needs only to record the sound pressure level of train passages. The measurement procedure is much simplified. To limit errors this method requires a railway bed of a height between 0 and 2 m above a roughly flat terrain that the ground impedance value(s) is not less than 200 kPas/m^ 2. Wind speed should be less than 5 m/s and a train length not shorter than 70 m. In real life these requirements can easily be satisfied so the method is really practical...|$|E
40|$|A {{rapid growth}} of {{installed}} wind power capacity is expectedin the next few years. However, the siting of wind turbines ona large scale raises concerns about their environmental impact,notably with respect to noise. To this end, variable speed windturbines offer a promising solution for applications in denselypopulated areas like the European countries, as this designwould enable an efficient utilisation of the masking effect dueto ambient noise. In rural and recreational areas where windturbines are sited, the ambient noise originates from theaction of wind on the vegetation and about the listener's ear(pseudo-noise). It shows a wind speed dependence similar tothat of the noise from a variable speed wind turbine and cantherefore mask the latter {{for a wide range}} of conditions. However, a problem inherent to the design of these machines istheir proclivity to pure tone generation, because of theenhanced difficulty of avoiding structural resonances in themechanical parts. Pure tones are deemed highly annoying and areseverely regulated by most noise policies. In relation to thisproblem, the vibration transmission of structure-borne sound tothe tower of the turbine is investigated, in particular whenthe tower is stiffened at its upper end. Furthermore, sincenoise annoyance due to wind turbine is mostly a masking issue,the wind-related sources of ambient noise are studied and theirmasking potentials assessed. With this aim, prediction modelsfor wind-induced vegetation noise and pseudo-noise have beendeveloped. Finally, closely related to the effect of masking,is the difficulty, regularly encountered by local authoritiesand wind farm developers, to measure <b>noise</b> <b>immission</b> from windturbines. A new measurement technique has thus been developedin the course of this work. Through improving thesignal-to-noise ratio between wind turbine noise and ambientnoise, the new technique yields more accurate measurementresults.

40|$|On {{high-volume}} roads {{cement concrete}} surfaces may be economically favourable {{in comparison to}} asphalt concrete. When a bypass for motorway E 4 in Uppsala (Sweden) was built, cement concrete was therefore selected as the wearing course. It {{is well known that}} noise characteristics of cement concrete surfaces may be poor unless a suitable texture is created. Earlier, the Swedish Road Administration has used the exposed aggregate technique to create a favourable surface texture on newly laid cement concrete on some motorways in Sweden, with both good and poor results. This time a special aggregate grading of the top layer was selected, attempting to combine the desire to have excellent durability against the wear of studded tyres in winter, and the desire to limit tyre/road noise emission from the motorway. Being a bypass, this motorway at some locations run rather near to suburban areas where <b>noise</b> <b>immission</b> might become a serious issue. Noise measurements were made with the CPX method, using four test tyres. The results on the exposed aggregate cement concrete (EACC) were compared with similar measurements on SMA surfaces with the same maximum aggregate size. As a reference for comparison three SMA 0 / 16 were chosen since this is the surface type that would normally be used on a motorway of this kind. The results indicated approx. 2 - 3 dB(A) lower tyre/road noise emission on the EACC than on the SMA 0 / 16 which was better than expected. In the paper the probable causes of the relatively low noise emission are analyzed. The positive results suggest that with a suitable proportioning of the aggregate in the surface layer and high quality exposure technique, the EACC may be used as a standard technique for texturing of cement concrete...|$|E

Action was taken on several points, including noise measurements, noise reduction, education on hearing protector use, and audiometric monitoring. It {{was found that the}} noise at the plant has been greatly reduced during a period of 25 years. The reduction in noise was made possible by identifying predominant sources of noise, changing the structure of the buildings and by changing production methods. The results are presented in the form of noise zone maps. By means of noise dosimetry, one case of automation was studied on a production line for large sheet metal punchpresses. It was found that the introduction of automation reduced the <b>noise</b> <b>immission</b> to the workers {{in spite of the fact}} that new sources of noise had been introduced. Also, the number of workers exposed to noise was reduced. The use of hearing protectors was studied through a questionnaire. A device was constructed which measured the use of earmuffs during the working day. It was found that 30 % of the workers reported problems due to heat, sweat, itching and other local problems. Few complaints regarding communic-ation difficulties and accident hazards were reported. The workers who had problems due to sweat were also found to have a higher production of sweat than other workers, under the same conditions. The audiograms in each age group were studied by means of a retrospective investigation covering 25 years. During the studied period, the median hearing thresholds in each age group improved by 17 - 20 dB HL. These improvements will have a major influence on the number of workers entitled to economic compensation as a consequence of noise-induced hearing loss. In a longitudinal investigation covering up to 15 years, an analysis was made of the audiograms of workers who had been employed at the plant for many years.

40|$|In room {{acoustics}} and <b>noise</b> <b>immission</b> prognosis, basically three algorithms for the computation {{of sound}} fields are in use. These are, {{in the order}} of reflection where they are efficient: the mirror image source method ray tracing methods (ray or beam tracing), among these tracing and recursive splitting of pyramidal beams ("pyrs"), and, sometimes to simulate the late reverberation, the radiosity method basing on the radiation interchange of pairs or surface patches. But, caused by their nature, the mean deficit of these geometrical and energetic methods is not to take wave effects as diffraction into account. But, with diffraction, the number of rays and computation time would explode exponentially. It was the aim, by introduction of diffraction modules, to extend those methods to lower frequencies respectively longer wavelengths where the room may be large but is not very large compared with wavelengths and to find a new uniform and universal algorithm to allow arbitrary combinations of reflections and diffractions, but without explosion of computation time. The idea for the solution: rays must be re-unified! This is achieved by quantization of solid angles as well as room surface into small patches and summing up of pyr energies arriving at the patches within certain time intervals. Both means: quantization of the space of mirror image sources. Pyrs whose vertices fall into cells of that mirror image source space are shifted to their center points, projected back to the original room, but not split up by the surface patches into smaller and smaller pyrs but, according to their overlap with the patches, their energies are interpolated and distributed to previously created quantized pyrs whose shapes are defined by aiming at the patches. To make pyr tracing efficient, a previous sub-division of the room's surface into convex walls and many small patches and a sub-division of the volume into convex sub-rooms is necessary. This is accomplished by the introduction of "transparent walls" between the sub-rooms. Thereby, a considerable simplification of the otherwise complicated pyr clipping procedure (polygon-polygon-intersections) is achieved, moreover, an elegant discovering of diffraction events at surface patches near to the edges on those transparent walls. Inspired by the uncertainty relation, for that purpose, an energetic ray diffraction model has been developed working with "deflection-angle-probability-density-functions" whose values are the higher the closer the ray passes an edge. Now, a huge amount of quantized pyrs are traced quasi-parallel in a kind of energy interchange procedure where the number of beams converges against a maximum value which may be set up by the user. Thus, quantized pyramidal beam tracing is a combination of the radiosity with the mirror image source method. With typical room acoustical applications, computation times may lie {{in the order of}} minutes up to some hours with modern PC. However, the required RAM is very high: 100 MB- 100 GB. So, the goal has been reached. However, the algorithms proposed still have to be implemented and validated...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish {{government}} have {{a goal that}} wind turbines shall produce 30 TWh by the year 2020, compared to about 3, 5 TWh produced in Sweden during 2010. To minimize the disturbance that wind turbines create the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency has stated a guideline value that noise from wind turbines at nearby residents shouldn’t exceed 40 dBA, at 8 m/s wind speed. With advanced calculation models, like Nord 2000, the emitted sound from future wind turbines can be calculated {{at an early stage}} to optimize the power production without exceeding the 40 dBA. When the turbines have been built {{there is a need to}} verify that they really are within the guideline. To measure the sound pressure level at nearby residents, a sound immission measurement, there is a Swedish method, Elforsk 98 : 24 (1) with the translated titled “measuring of <b>noise</b> <b>immission</b> from wind turbines”. There is also an international standard IEC 61400 - 11 (2) focused on how to measure the emitted sound power level, also called sound emission measurement. To verify the sound level at a resident building a sound immission measurement is the preferred method. However this method has some practical limitations, for example the background sound level is often higher than the guideline value of 40 dBA, which makes it hard to estimate the equivalent sound pressure level of the wind turbine. A further development of this method was outlined in a draft translated “Measuring of sound from wind turbines –draft 2005 ” (3). The method in this draft is based on a sound emission measurement, compatible with the IEC 61400 - 11, in combination with a simple formula to calculate the sound immission level. The draft also contains a method for measuring the sound attenuation from the wind turbine to the resident, which can be used together with the measured sound power level to calculate the sound immission level. The intention of this thesis is to further develop today’s method for sound immission measurement of wind turbines. To achieve this, theoretical studies have been undertaken to study the elements relevant to the measurement, like sound generation, attenuation and relevant measurement equipment. Swedish and international measurement methods and guideline values have been studied. Measurements based on the draft (3) have been performed and shows that the method of measuring the sound attenuation, outlined in the draft, can provide results where the present method would fail. But the sound attenuation measuring method is still hampered by high background sound levels and has some practical limitations compared to the present method Elforsk 98 : 24. Conclusions from this thesis is that calculations of sound immission levels, based on measured sound power level, is a method that is and will continue to be a part of the assessment of sound levels from wind turbines. To ensure high quality of these assessments the procedure should be standardized and the use of advanced calculation models should be included. In cases where the sound attenuation path crosses hilly terrain, water or where the guideline values are exceeded, calculations with more advanced method should be advocated...|$|E
