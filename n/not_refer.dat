5|$|The root mil in million does <b>not</b> <b>refer</b> to the numeral, 1.

Although Quimper's journal of the voyage does <b>not</b> <b>refer</b> to the mountain, one of Haro's manuscript charts includes a sketch of Mount Baker.

The Charity Commission later said that it had received over 160 complaints about the helpline's handling of the situation. The helpline service was voluntarily suspended; it resumed two days later.|$|E

Horodecki unique architectural style earned him praise as the Antoni Gaudí of Kiev.|$|E

40|$|Background. Postoperative hand {{therapy in}} {{patients}} after surgery for Dupuytren's contracture is common medical practice to improve outcomes. Until now, patients are referred for postoperative hand rehabilitation on an empirical basis. Purpose. To evaluate whether referral criteria after surgery because of Dupuytren's disease were actually adhered to, and, to analyse differences in outcomes between {{patients who were}} referred according to the criteria (correctly referred) {{and those who were}} <b>not</b> <b>referred</b> but should have been (incorrectly <b>not</b> <b>referred).</b> Methods. Referral pattern was evaluated prospectively in 46 patients. Total active/ passive range of joint motion (TAM/ TPM), sensibility, pinch force, Disability Arm Shoulder Hand questionnaire (DASH) and Michigan Hand outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) were used as outcome measures preoperatively and 10 months postoperatively. Results. In total 21 patients were referred correctly and 17 patients were incorrectly <b>not</b> <b>referred.</b> Significant improvements on TAM/ TPM, DASH and MHQ were found at follow- up for the total group. No differences in outcomes were found between patients correctly referred and patients incorrectly <b>not</b> <b>referred</b> for postoperative hand therapy. Conclusion. Referral criteria were not adhered to. Given the lack of differences in outcomes between patients correctly referred and patients incorrectly <b>not</b> <b>referred,</b> postoperative hand therapy in Dupuytren's disease should be reconsidered...|$|R

5|$|The heraldic {{term for}} an X-shaped cross is a 'saltire', {{from the old}} French word saultoir or salteur (itself derived from the Latin saltatorium), a word for both a type of stile {{constructed}} from two cross pieces and a type of cross-shaped stirrup-cord. In heraldic language, it may be blazoned azure, a saltire argent. The tincture of the Saltire can appear as either silver (argent) or white, however the term azure does <b>not</b> <b>refer</b> to a particular shade of blue.|$|E
5|$|At 10:00a.m., Coast Guard {{stations}} and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Weather Bureau offices at Lake Superior ports raised white pennants above square red flags with black centers, indicating a storm warning with northwesterly winds. By late afternoon, the storm signal flags were {{replaced with a}} vertical sequence of red, white, and red lanterns, indicating that a hurricane with winds over 74mph (119km/h) was coming. (The word hurricane here does <b>not</b> <b>refer</b> to a tropical cyclone, but to Force 12 winds on the Beaufort scale.) The winds on Lake Superior had already reached 50mph (80km/h), and an accompanying blizzard was moving toward Lake Huron.|$|E
5|$|Exquemelin {{wrote that}} Morgan's men {{undertook}} widespread torture {{in several of}} the towns they captured. According to Stephen Snelders, in his history of piracy, the Spanish reports of Morgan's raids do <b>not</b> <b>refer</b> to torture being practiced on the residents of Porto Bello or Gibraltar – although there are reliable reports that it was carried out in Panama. The historian Patrick Pringle observes that while torture seems cruel and ruthless to contemporary eyes, it was an accepted part of judicial interrogation in many European countries at the time. Morgan always fought with a commission from the governor of Jamaica. In doing so, he was acting as a reserve naval force for the English government in the defence of Jamaica. As the Spanish did not recognise privateering as a legal activity, even if a captain carried letters of marque, they considered Morgan to be a pirate, something he firmly rejected.|$|E

However, Barry Wiley has written that when Crookes published his report on the experiments in the Quarterly Journal of Science in 1871 {{he did not mention}} all the names of the observers present in the room. Wiley has stated that four females were present during the experiments as was Crookes' brother and the original report by Crookes did <b>not</b> <b>refer</b> to any spirits but many years later in 1889 he revealed in his Notes of séances with D. D. Home the names of the observers and claimed Home was in communication with spirits.|$|E
5|$|In late 1986, {{questions}} were asked in the UK Parliament concerning the matters in Lobster. Then Labour Party Member of Parliament for Hull North, Kevin McNamara, brought up {{the issue in the}} House of Commons, asking the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to refer the matter to the Security Commission, and asking then Attorney-General and Conservative MP Michael Havers, to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate allegations published in Lobster and prosecute Colin Wallace for revealing details of secret service operations against Her Majesty's Government. Both declined. Two weeks later, Labour MP Tam Dalyell asked the Prime Minister why she would <b>not</b> <b>refer</b> the matter to the Security Commission, but she said that she had nothing more to add.|$|E
5|$|Mandarin square: Mandarin squares {{were large}} {{embroidered}} badges sewn onto the surcoat of an officials in Imperial China, Korea and Vietnam.

5|$|Many {{associations}} between adult oviraptorosaur skeletons or embryos with elongatoolithid eggs (including Macroolithus) demonstrate that Macroolithus and other elongatoolithids were laid by oviraptorosaurs. One oviraptorosaur skeleton from the Upper Cretaceous of China {{was described in}} 2005; two shelled elongatoolithid eggs were preserved inside of its pelvis. This suggests that oviraptorosaurs had two functional oviducts where both would produce eggs simultaneously. While Sato et al. did <b>not</b> <b>refer</b> the eggs specifically to Macroolithus, they noted that the eggs closely resemble M. yaotunensis, though with a thinner eggshell. The thin eggshell, however, could simply be because the shell had not finished forming when the mother died, or because of biochemical dissolution of the shell before fossilization.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{seventeen}} sectors {{along the}} Normandy coastline {{had been selected}} as possible invasion sites and each were provided with a code name taken {{from one of the}} spelling alphabets of the time. The coast was divided between Able, west of Omaha, to Rodger on the eastern flank of the invasion area. Eight further sectors were added when the planned invasion was extended to include Utah. Each sector was further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours Green, Red, and White. Gold did <b>not</b> <b>refer</b> to a particular beach but to a landing area. It was delineated by Port-en-Bessin on the west and La Rivière on the east, and included Arromanches, location of one of the artificial Mulberry harbours that were to be constructed shortly after the invasion. High cliffs at the western end of the zone meant that the landings would be undertaken on the flat beach between Le Hamel and La Rivière, in the sectors code-named Jig and King. The area immediately behind the beach was marshy, with open ground and bocage (small fields surrounded by hedges and embankments) further inland. Roads led to the south via Asnelles and Ver-sur-Mer. The terrain to the south-east rose to a ridge at Meuvaines, where on D-Day were located machine gun nests of the German 726th Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{chemistry}} is the philosophical {{study of the}} methodology {{and content of the}} science {{of chemistry}}. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by quantum mechanics or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of how theories are confirmed in the context of confirming reaction mechanisms. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of. Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do <b>not</b> <b>refer</b> to specific physical entities, such as chemical bonds.|$|E
