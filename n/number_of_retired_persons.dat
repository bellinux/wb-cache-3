The birthrate in France was extremely high during this period; 800,000 persons were born in France during 1946, and a similar number in 1947 and 1948. Those under 20 years of age numbered thirty percent of the French population in 1936; it grew to thirty-six percent by 1962. In the 1960s, the population remained relatively stable; the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>retired</b> <b>persons</b> departing was matched by young persons arriving in Paris {{from other parts of}} France and abroad. Between 1968 and 1975, the number of new arrivals in the region dropped to 114,000, and between 1975 and 1982, the {{population of}} the region fell by 273,000. With the economic crisis in the 1970s, the birthrate on France fell; it dropped by 18 percent between 1972 and 1976.

This evaluation also considers the reform in the system's financing method. from pay-as-you-go to full funding. We find that the negative impact on the welfare of older workers of an increase in retirement ages can be reduced or increased, depending on how the transition from a pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded one is financed.

40|$|In this article, {{the issue}} of {{demographics}} is presented {{as one of the}} most important factors in regard to the future development of Slovenia. We are still not fully aware of the consequences of the demographic development in the past, which has caused the current situation. The balance between the active and retired population is disturbed, as the percentage of retired persons is on the increase. This process will continue, because the number of retirements will increase in the future, mainly due to the demographic reasons. In regard to the current age the structure of the population in Slovenia, we can expect a huge and absolute increase in the number of elderly people and an even faster increase in the percentage of elderly people in the entire population. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>retired</b> <b>persons</b> will indirectly increase due to the longer life expectancy. In a demographic sense, the increase of elderly people means a significantly higher annual number of deaths and therefore a strong negative natural growth. This will be even more evident due to the significant decrease of the number of births in the last 30 years. This problem arises not only from low birth rates, but also due to the fact that the generations of women in their fertility period are less numerous...|$|E
40|$|Description of {{the paper}} – e. g. topic, {{research}} question, objective, purpose, value, conceptual or theoretical framework, state of the art: Adult learning is a subject of ever growing interest, as the population of persons 65 and older grows in industrialised countries. By 2010 the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>retired</b> <b>persons</b> in the European Union will be almost {{twice as large as}} in 1995 (Ilmarinen & Costa, 2000). Increasing longevity, better health care and medical services, early retirement or forced retirement through redundancy and retrenchment are among the reasons cited for the increasing numbers of persons 50 years of age and older, who have reached what is called “mature age”, “the third age”, “the second adulthood” and “mature adulthood” (Giddens, 1998; Illeris, 1999). Many of these individuals can look forward to as many as 30 or more years of mature adulthood. From a learning perspective, mature adulthood encompasses the years after retirement until ageing processes constitute a hinder for learning (ibid). Whether or not education systems, educationalists and educational research will be able to provide for and/or understand the learning needs of the growing numbers of persons who have reached mature adulthood or will shortly do so, may arguably depend upon {{the extent to which a}} re-conceptualisation of adult learning is undertaken. Illeris’ learning theory and Melluci’s theory constitute the theoretical framework. Methodology or methods/research instruments or sources used: The aim of this paper is to describe what makes people want ”to learn to learn” and keep on learning in mature adulthood, against the background of the Malmö Longitudinal Study. Utilising data on individuals who have reached retirement age and who have expressed a desire to take university courses after retirement, this group of individuals will be described. Firstly, however, the Malmö Longitudinal Study will be briefly described, followed by a short description of Malmö in 1920 - 1930 s. Secondly, the paper will focus on learning in mature adulthood, especially learning within the context of the University of the Third Age (U 3 A) [...] Thirdly, quantitative and qualitative data from the Malmö Longitudinal Study will be presented as regards this group of individuals. Finally, a discussion will be undertaken, followed by the conclusion. Conclusions or expected outcomes or findings: This paper has attempted to describe what makes people want “to learn to learn” and keep on learning, even after retirement. The results can be interpreted to show that schooling and working life conditions, among other factors, play a significant role in individuals’ capacity “to learn to learn”. As this article has demonstrated, longitudinal data can provide insight, although their usefulness is unfortunately restricted by the often exclusive use of quantitative data collection and analysis methods, which provide little or no space for respondents’ voice. In this article the voice of a group of persons, who grew up when the Swedish welfare state first came into being and have retired when the welfare state [...] -for all intents and purposes [...] is dismantled, has a central role. Despite the hardships that characterised their childhood, and problems they face in mature adulthood [...] -personal tragedies, financial problems and illness [...] -these individuals appear even after retirement to be social actors who make use of their options and continue to construct their own identities. In this work they make use of their “symbolic resources”. Among the resources these people appear to have in common are self-esteem and reflexivity. Arguably a sense of solidarity, and the benefits of strong working-class organizations and long-standing egalitarian policies can also be considered to comprise resources for this population. Unfortunately, the latter resources are not available for individuals in contemporary Sweden to the same extent that they have been for this population. Although the focus of this article is older adult learners who have expressed an interest in university courses, the extent to which the remaining population as a whole has indicated an interest in education after retirement would seem to indicate that these individuals as a group grew up in a culture of learning that had significant impact on their lives and their interest in education. The role that teachers had in forming pupils’ futures [...] for better or for worse [...] -provides food for thought: the characteristics of the individuals in Malmö Longitudinal Study raise important questions regarding the role of education for health and well-being, as well as the association between learning and longevity...|$|E
40|$|Do “economic and {{demographic}} pressures for costly welfare expenditures provoke actions {{to roll back}} eligibility and benefit rates that link increasing <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> unemployed and <b>retired</b> <b>persons</b> to increased social spending ” as Hicks and Zorn’s 2005 article in International Organization claims? Does {{outward foreign direct investment}} (FDI) pressure for retrenchment even as “trade openness and financial liberalization ” are “clearly operating against such retrenchments”? 1 Do political factors or other socioeconomic factors, perhaps, drive retrenchments? We reopen these questions—and related ones—here because of the existence of errors in the data (and its documentation) analyzed in the Hicks and Zorn’s 2005 article that call for some correction of sources and revision of analyses. Reanalysis nullifies most of the major nonnull findings from 2005 article, although it brings new conclusions. In particular, the thesis of self-limiting immoderation—the idea that the demographic pressures for welfare expansion measured by unemployment rates and the elderly share of populations may become so unsustainable that they trigger welfare retrenchment—no longer receives support at any conventional significance level. Indications of FDI pressure for retrenchment fade, although trade openness, if not financial liberalization, does appear rather strongly appear to inhibi...|$|R
40|$|A key {{question}} in debates over globalization is {{its effect on}} the welfare states in particular on welfare retrenchments : programmatic retractions of the scope and coverage of social programs. We conceptualize such retrenchments as discrete policy events; and we offer a comprehensive model of their occurrence that integrates domestic economic, political, and institutional factors as well as those related to the global economy. Our analysis of all such retrenchments in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations between 1978 and 1994 indicates that the effects of globalization are complex, with trade openness and financial liberalization clearly operating against such retrenchments but outward foreign direct investment perhaps pressuring for them. In addition, we uncover support for a dynamic of self-limiting immoderation : economic and demographic pressures for costly welfare expenditures provoke actions to roll back eligibility and benefit rates that link increasing <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> unemployed and <b>retired</b> <b>persons</b> to increased social spending. In short, the same demographic pressures that gave often been noted to substantially drive welfare spending may trigger welfare cutbacks. Our thanks to A. A.
