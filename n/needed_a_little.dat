Ron hears Hermione through the device as she says his name {{for the first time}} since he left, and, when he clicks it, the emitted ball of light enters his body and allows him to locate and Apparate to the vicinity of Harry and Hermione's camp. Rowling stated Dumbledore left it to Ron because he believed he might have <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more guidance than Harry and Hermione.|$|E
500|$|Hamm was {{not allowed}} to perform rewrites during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. Warren Skaaren, who had also worked on Burton's Beetlejuice, did rewrites. Jonathan Gems and Charles McKeown rewrote the script during filming. Only Skaaren {{received}} screenplay credit with Hamm. Hamm criticized the rewrites, but blamed the changes on Warner Bros. Burton explained, [...] "I don't understand why that became such a problem. We started out with a script that everyone liked, although we recognized it <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> work." [...] Dick Grayson appeared in the shooting script but was deleted, as the filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to the plot. Bob Kane supported this decision.|$|E
500|$|Scott Leva {{was still}} {{associated}} with the character through Marvel (he had appeared in photo covers of the comic), and read each draft. Leva commented, [...] "Ted Newsom and John Brancato had written the script. It was good but it <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> work. Unfortunately, with every subsequent rewrite by other writers, it went from good to bad to terrible." [...] Due to Cannon's assorted financial crises, the project shut down after spending about $1.5million on the project. In 1989, Pathé, owned by corrupt Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, acquired the overextended Cannon. The filmmaking cousins parted, Globus remaining associated with Pathé, Golan leaving to run 21st Century Film Corporation, keeping a number of properties (including Spider-Man) {{in lieu of a}} cash buy-out. He also extended his Spider-Man option with Marvel up to January 1992.|$|E

500|$|Asher told Barbara Avedon {{about the}} {{students}}' script, {{saying that it}} only <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> reworking, and he asked if she would help the students with the rewrite. Avedon, who had written for The Donna Reed Show and been a regular writer for Bewitched, accepted his request. Avedon visited Jefferson High School and later said of the experience, [...] "I was horrified. Locker doors were hanging off their hinges. There wasn't a blade of grass in sight." [...] Avedon expressed amazement over the script the students produced and helped them revise it and expand its length so it would sustain a full half-hour episode. She promised the students that no changes would {{be made to the}} script unless they approved. It was because of her recommendation that the story was reformulated as a Christmas episode, which she suggested because the script [...] "was so imbued with the spirit." [...] She said that one of the students indicated a desire to write for Bewitched because the series deals with miscegenation by way of a marriage between a witch and a mortal. [...] The final script credited the teleplay to Avedon and Asher, and the story to all 26 students, who were listed on screen in alphabetical order.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to capture the spontaneity of live performances, five of Wild Lifes eight songs were first takes by the band. The album {{included}} a cover of Mickey & Sylvia's [...] "Love Is Strange". Like Ram, Wild Life left music critics cold, a response that typified the anti-McCartney sentiments that prevailed among the music press following the Beatles' break-up. In their 1975 book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler called Wild Life [...] "rushed, defensive, badly timed, and over-publicized", and wrote that it showed McCartney's songwriting [...] "at an absolute nadir just when he <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> respect". Wings similarly struggled to gain artistic credibility, particularly during the early 1970s, with critics, fans and McCartney's musical peers alike ridiculing the inclusion of Linda as a keyboard player and backing vocalist.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Jackson {{claimed that}} the poor {{reception}} [...] "wasn't particularly surprising" [...] because [...] "it does take you {{a while to get}} used to it. Ten minutes is sort of marginal, it probably <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more". However, once the entire film was released, many critics retained their complaints. While many noted the clarity and immediacy of the action scenes, they also criticised the picture quality as [...] "hyper-real," [...] clear enough to detect [...] "painted sets" [...] and [...] "prosthetic noses". Some critics did respond positively to the overall effect of the higher frame rate, saying it just takes a while to get used to– still allowing that the extra clarity can make some scenes look like [...] "actors on a set rather than a scene in a movie".|$|E
2500|$|Curly's childlike mannerisms {{and natural}} comedic charm {{made him a}} hit with audiences, {{particularly}} children. He was known in the act for having an [...] "indestructible" [...] head, which always won out by breaking anything that assaulted it, including saws (resulting in his characteristic quip, [...] "Oh, look!"). Although having no formal acting training, his comedic skills were exceptional. Many times, directors would simply let the camera roll freely and let Curly improvise. Jules White, in particular, would leave gaps in the Stooge scripts where Curly could improvise for several minutes. In later years, White commented: [...] "If we wrote a scene and <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> something extra, I'd say to Curly, 'Look, we've got a gap to fill this in with a [...] "woob-woob" [...] or some other bit of business.' And he never disappointed us." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{think they}} always had me in mind for Nova. But they needed someone to do the screen test, and you keep trying to employ your actors. So. I did the screen test. The part that {{was hard for me}} was {{actually}} doing the mask,where they put all that plaster on your face and you have to lie there still for a long time. Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mullen, who had mostly been {{absent from}} the {{sessions}} {{to start a family}} and nurse a worsening back injury, had major surgery on his back in November 1995. Mullen was unable to drum properly during this period, forcing U2 to abandon their usual methods of songwriting as a group but also allowing them to pursue different musical influences. Mullen admits that he was upset that the band entered the studio without him, cognizant that key decisions would be made in the early months of recording. Eno attempted to convince the other band members to wait for Mullen, but as the Edge explains, [...] "The thinking was {{that we were going to}} further experiment with the notion of what a band was all about and find new ways to write songs, accepting the influence, and aesthetics of dance music... we thought, 'Let's just start with Howie mixing drum beats and see where that gets us.'" [...] Mullen was back in the studio three weeks after his surgery, but his back prevented him from fully dedicating himself to recording. As he described, [...] "I <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time to recover. But we were struggling with some of the material and for the project to move ahead, I had to put a lot of time in." [...] Sessions ceased temporarily in January 1996 to allow Mullen to rehabilitate.|$|E
