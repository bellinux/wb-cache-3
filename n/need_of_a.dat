5|$|In 1809 Napoleon {{brought the}} {{manuscript}} {{as a victory}} trophy to Paris, but in 1815 it was returned to the Vatican Library.

On his last night in Honda, the General returns late to camp and finds one of his old friends, Miranda Lyndsay, waiting for him. The General recalls that fifteen years ago, she had learned of a plot against his life and had saved him. The following morning, the General begins the voyage down the Magdalena River. Both his physical debilitation and pride are evident as he negotiates the slope to the dock: he is in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sedan chair but refuses to use it. The group stays a night in Puerto Real, where the General claims he sees a woman singing during the night. His aides-de-camp and the watchman conduct a search, but they fail to uncover any sign of a woman having been in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|After {{multiple}} failures, the Turtle Rock team {{looked for}} a business partner, a company that supported the idea and was in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> co-operative shooter to fit into their games lineup. They eventually partnered with THQ for Evolve, which would serve as the game's publisher and help with funding. According to Robb, they had to show the game on their iPad, as they forgot to bring the battery for their laptop. THQ's then president, Danny Bilson and later, Jason Rubin were also excited about the idea. However, at that time, THQ had already entered financial difficulties, suffering from a severe decline in profits. Turtle Rock also knew that THQ had internal problems, but Turtle Rock decided not to part with THQ.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's capital {{moved from}} Kharkiv to Kiev in 1934, {{and the city}} was in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{suburban}} residence for government officials. Mezhyhirya {{was chosen as the}} site of the new government residence. The decision of the Politburo in April 1935 ordered the demolition of the whole complex. Before the scheduled demolition in 1936, the architecture and buildings of the monastic complex were photographed. During the demolition, an underground library was discovered, full of handwritten manuscripts. There are speculations that the discovered books belonged to the lost library of Yaroslav the Wise, or perhaps of a later period, during the times of the Zaporozhian Host. The only thing that remains now of the monastic complex is a water well.|$|E

5|$|All the same, between 1853 and the 1930s, fiscal {{instability}} was a transitory phenomenon. The depressions of 1873–77 and 1890–91 {{played a}} crucial role in fostering the rise of industry: timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s, industry grew with each crisis in response to the <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import-substitution. By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in commercial activities. In 1913, the country's income per head was on a par with that of France and Germany, and far ahead of Italy's or Spain's. At the end of 1913, Argentina had a gold stock of £59 million, or 3.7% of the world's monetary gold, while representing 1.2% of the world's economic output.|$|E
5|$|Although Emerson {{credits his}} grandfather's {{gift of a}} Barlow knife {{to him at the}} age of eight years with {{starting}} his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that he turned to making them. The summer of 1978 found Emerson in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> balisong knife for his study of a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford one on his salary, Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong {{was born}} in what would soon become the {{province}} of Ontario in 1867. After briefly teaching school, he entered the business industry, as a druggist. After initially gaining experience in politics on the council of Eastnor Township, he relocated west {{to the city of}} Edmonton, Alberta. In Edmonton, he established his pharmaceutical business once again and worked briefly with his brother on real estate and construction projects. In 1907, he ran for election to the Edmonton City Council and was elected to a two-year term. In 1910, he decided to run for the mayoralty in the municipal election; uncontested as the only nominated candidate on election day, Armstrong was acclaimed to the mayor's chair for the upcoming year. During his term, several issues were brought up to attention, including the city's <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new civic building and the possibility of two new gas plants for the city.|$|E

5|$|Hood {{was due to}} be modernised in 1941 {{to bring}} her up to a {{standard}} {{similar to that of}} other modernised World War I-era capital ships. She would have received new, lighter turbines and boilers, a secondary armament of eight twin 5.25-inch gun turrets and six octuple 2-pounder pom-poms. Her 5-inch upper armour strake would have been removed and her deck armour reinforced. A catapult would have been fitted across the deck and the remaining torpedo tubes removed. In addition the conning tower would have been removed and her bridge rebuilt. The ship's near-constant active service, resulting from her status as the Royal Navy's most battle-worthy fast capital ship, meant that her material condition gradually deteriorated, and by the mid-1930s she was in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lengthy overhaul.|$|E

5|$|In God Speaks, Meher Baba {{describes}} {{the journey of}} the soul from its original state of unconscious divinity to the ultimate attainment of conscious divinity. The whole journey is a journey of imagination, where the original indivisible state of God imagines becoming countless individualized souls which he likens to bubbles within an infinite ocean. Each soul, powered {{by the desire to}} become conscious, starts its journey in the most rudimentary form of consciousness. This limitation brings the <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more developed form to advance it towards an increasingly conscious state.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Zappa met Ray Collins. Collins {{supported}} himself by {{working as a}} carpenter, and on weekends sang with {{a group called the}} Soul Giants. Collins got into a fight with their guitar player, who quit, leaving the band in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> substitute, and Zappa filled in. The Soul Giants' repertoire originally consisted of R covers; though after Zappa joined the band he encouraged them to play his own original material and try to get a record contract. While most of the band members liked the idea, then-leader and saxophone player Davy Coronado felt that performing original material would cost them bookings, and quit the band. The Soul Giants became the Mothers and Zappa took over leadership of the band.|$|E
