Included are the first contaminant data to be reported in the blubber of the Sowerbys beaked whale (Mesoploden bidens). Twenty CBs were measured, including the toxic <b>non-ortho</b> <b>substituted</b> <b>congeners</b> (CBs 77, 126, 169). The sum of all CBs measured ranged from 0. 27 to 67. 9 µg/g wet weight with the highest concentration being found in a male Atlantic white sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus) stranded {{on the west coast}} of Ireland. Toxic equivalents (TEQs) to 2, 3, 4, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin have been calculated for toxic di-, mono- and <b>non-ortho</b> <b>substituted</b> CBs and these show that in many species CBs 118, 126 and 156 and 170 account for a large proportion of CB toxicity.

40|$|Polyclorinated biphenyls are {{ubiquitous}} pollutants {{which are}} associated with wasting syndrome, reproductive problems, teratogenicity and mortality in wildlife (Borgmann et al. 1990; Kubiak et al. 1989). There are 209 PCB congeners which differentially partition, bioaccumulate and degrade in the environment. It is important to analyze the exposure dynamics of individual PCBs, as congener toxicity and persistence varies considerably. This study examined the dynamics and distribution of 42 congeners in sediment and biota from the Western Basin of Lake Erie. The <b>non-ortho</b> <b>substituted</b> <b>congeners</b> IUPAC # 77, # 126 and # 169 were quantified, and their concentrations were examined in various trophic levels. The AHH induction potency of each coplanar PCB was determined using the AHH assay on rat (H 4 IIE), mouse (Hepa Clone 9) and human (Hep G 2) cell lines. The PCB dynamics in the food web sampled were more complex than predicted by thermodynamic partitioning. Tetrachlorinated biphenyls were found to dominate lower trophic level samples; whereas, predatory animals exhibited much higher levels of hexa- and heptachlorinated biphenyls. The composition of PCB congeners was different for each trophic level, while concentrations of total PCB (equal to the sum of 42 congeners) increased with increasing trophic level. There were few differences {{in the distribution of}} ortho-substituted PCBs among species 2 ̆ 7 tissues. Coplanar PCBs were found in Lake Erie species. Residues of congener # 126 and # 169 were detected in herring gull eggs and in benthic organisms only, whereas # 77 was present in all samples. There were significant differences in the partitioning of coplanar PCBs between muscle, liver and egg tissues for all fish species sampled. The proportion of total PCB congeners that were coplanar decreased with increasing trophic level. The AHH assay indicated that congener # 126 induced Hepa Clone 9 mouse cells more than # 77 or # 169, and slightly less than TCDD. The H 4 IIE and Hep G 2 cells did not give consistent results; however, the coplanar PCBs did induce AHH activity in both cell lines. Experiments with tissue extracts gave very low levels of enzyme activity, while chemical combinations induced lower activity levels than anticipated. This may have been the result of competitive inhibition by less potent inducers such as congener # 77. Dept. of Biological Sciences.

A method was developed that combined the fractionation of PCBs, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in a variety of biotic environmental samples. Many of these samples have high concentrations of PCBs which cause fractionation problems as adsorption sites on the graphitic surface are occupied. The loading capacity of the column for PCBs was determined by injecting up to 1 mg of total PCBs and monitoring changes in chromatographic behavior of tetra- / di-ortho, mono-ortho and <b>non-ortho</b> <b>substituted</b> PCBs. Effective loading capacities were 1 mg for tetra- / di-ortho PCBs, but only 3 – 5 µg for non-ortho PCBs and about 2 µg for mono-ortho PCBs.

In their own right, mixed polybrominated/polychlorinated biphenyls (PXBs) represent {{a new class of}} environmental contaminants, recently detected in food and human tissues. Gas chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QMS), gas chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOFMS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ion chromatography (IC) served to analyse the volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (V/SVOCs), including mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PXDD/Fs), and gaseous products including HBr/HCl.

After each fire the concentration of all mass labelled PCDD/PCDF congeners in the surface soil decreased, however, the concentration of some native 2, 3, 7, 8 <b>substituted</b> <b>congeners</b> increased, indicating that formation was occurring. Mass labelled PCDD/PCDF congeners were detected in all ash samples, mean 2. 8 pg g(- 1) (range 0. 5 - 8 pg g(- 1)), demonstrating release from the soil. Additionally, mass labelled PCDD/PCDF congeners were detected in all air samples mean 1. 2 mu g (t fuel) (- 1) (range 0. 2 - 2. 0 mu g (t fuel) (- 1)), again demonstrating release from the soil.

40|$|The {{disposal}} and dumping {{of toxic}} waste {{is a matter of}} growing concern in developing countries, including South Africa. Frequently these countries do not possess access to gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) for the determination of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This publication describes an alternative approach to the investigation {{of toxic waste}} using comprehensive gas chromatography coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS). The technology permits both comprehensive screening of toxic samples for numerous classes of organic pollutants and also quantitative analysis for the individual compounds. This paper describes the use of this technique by analysing samples obtained from a hazardous waste treatment facility in South Africa. After sampling and extraction the samples were analysed for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and four dioxin-like <b>non-ortho</b> <b>substituted</b> polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The quantitative values, as well as detection limits, obtained using the GC × GC-TOFMS methodology compares well with those obtained using GC-HRMS; the accepted benchmark technology for this analysis. Although GC GC-TOFMS is not a target compound analytical technique (as is GC-HRMS), it is possible to obtain information on numerous other classes of organic pollutants present in the samples in one analytical run. This is not possible with GC-HRMS.

Schleheck, T. P. Knepper, K. Fischer, and A. M. Cook, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 70 : 4053 - 4063). The degradation of centrally <b>substituted</b> <b>congeners</b> by strain DS- 1 was examined in this work. 5 -C 10 -LAS yielded not only the predicted 4 -C 8 -SPC, 4 -C 8 -SPC- 2 H, and 6 -C 10 -SPC (about 70 % of products) but also sulfophenyl dicarboxylates (SPdC), i. e., C 6 -, C 8 -, and C 10 -SPdC. These were identified by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) after separation by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). ESI ion-trap MS and ESI-time of flight-MS were used to confirm the identities of key intermediates. Different mixtures of congeners obtained by separation of commercial LAS by HPLC were degraded, and the degradative products were compared. If a congener carried the sulfophenyl substituent on the 5, 6, or 7 position, SPdCs were formed as well as SPC, SPC- 2 H, and SPC+ 2 C, whereas the substituent on the 2, 3, or 4 position yielded only SPC, SPC- 2 H, and SPC+ 2 C. Some 50 products were generated from the 20 LAS congeners: 11 major SPCs, each with an SPC- 2 H and an SPC+ 2 C (i. e., 33 SPC and SPC- 2 H species), and about 17 SPdC species.

40|$|By taking {{advantage}} of the peculiar dynamic covalent reactivity of boronic acids to form tetraboronate derivatives, interest has risen to use the aryl derivatives in materials science and supramolecular chemistry, nevertheless their ability to form H-bonded complexes has been only marginally touched. Herein we report the first solution and solid-state binding studies of first double H-bonded DD•AA-type complexes of a series of aromatic boronic acids that adopt a synsyn conformation with suitable complementary H-bonding acceptor partners. The first determination of the Ka in solution of ortho substituted boronic acids showed that 1 : 1 association is in the range between 300 and 6900 M- 1. Crystallization of dimeric 1 : 1, trimeric 1 : 2 and 2 : 1 complexes enabled in depth examination of these complexes in the solid state, proving the selection of the –B(OH) 2 syn-syn conformer through a pair of frontal H-bonds with the relevant AA partner. <b>Non-ortho</b> <b>substituted</b> boronic acids result in “flat” complexes.

Solid-state studies of a diboronic acid and a tetraazanaphthacene provided {{for the first time the}} formation of a supramolecular H-bonded polymeric ribbon. Given the conformational dynamicity of the –B(OH) 2 functional group, it is expected that these findings will also open new possibilities in metal-free catalysis or organic crystal engineering, where double H-bonding donor boronic acids could act as suitable organocatalysts or templates developing functional materials with tailored organizational properties.

40|$|Polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBDD) and dibenzofurans (PBDF) are a {{group of}} {{compounds}} of emerging interest as potential environmental stressors. Their structures as well as toxic responses {{are similar to the}} highly characterized toxicants polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins. High levels of PBDDs have been found in algae, shellfish, and fish, also from remote areas in theBaltic Sea. This thesis presents studies on PBDD behavior in fish and offspring, and natural formation of PBDDs from naturally abundant phenolic precursors. The uptake, elimination, and maternal transfer of mono- to tetraBDD/Fs were investigated in an exposure study reported in Paper I. The effects of PBDDs in fish were examined in a dose-response study (Paper II). It was shown that fish can assimilate PBDD/Fs from their feed, although non-laterally <b>substituted</b> <b>congeners</b> were rapidly eliminated. Laterally <b>substituted</b> <b>congeners</b> were retained as was congeners without vicinal hydrogens to some extent. PBDD/Fs were transferred to eggs, and congeners that were rapidly eliminated in fish showed a higher transfer ratio to eggs. Exposure to the laterally substituted 2, 3, 7, 8 -TeBDD had significant effects on the health, gene expression and several reproduction end-points of zebrafish, even at the lowest dose applied. The geographical and temporal variations of PBDD in biota samples from the Baltic Seasuggest biogenic rather than anthropogenic origin. In Paper III, bromoperoxidase-mediated coupling of 2, 4, 6 -tribromophenol yielded several PBDD congeners, some formed after rearrangement. The overall yield was low, but significantly higher at low temperature, and the product profile obtained was similar to congener profiles found in biota from the Swedish West Coast. In Paper IV, photo­chemi­cally induced cyclization of hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers under natural conditions produced PBDDs at percentage yield. Rearranged products were not detected, and some abundant congeners {{do not seem to be}} formed this way. However, the product profile obtained was similar to congener profiles found in biota from the Baltic Proper. Since the PBDD congeners found in biota have a high turn-over in fish, the exposure must be high and continuous to yield the PBDD levels measured in wild fish. Thus, PBDDs must presumably be formed by common precursors in general processes, such as via enzymatic oxidations, UV-initiated reactions or a combination of both. The presented pathways for formation of PBDDs are both likely sensitive to changes in climatic conditions...|$|R

A control animal not knwon to be exposed to dioxins in excess of background levels showed dioxin concentrations in milk and subcutaneous fat as expected except for two congeners indicating a possible accidental exposure to pentachlorophenol. From the dioxin concentrations in milk and subcutaneous fat of the Lickebaert cows half lifes could be calculated for nine congeners.

Because thyroid hormones (TH) are essential for normal neurologic development, {{it has been suggested that}} the deleterious neurodevelopmental effect of PCBs may occur through TH disruption. PCBs may in turn affect TH levels by inducing the microsomal enzyme uridinediphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-GT), which is involved in TH elimination.

Residents of Anniston are known to have elevated levels of PCBs. The objective {{of the study was to}} test the hypothesis that levels of the various lipid components (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides) are differentially associated with concentrations of total PCBs and total pesticides, and further that different congeners, congener groups and different pesticides do not have identical associations in serum samples obtained from Anniston residents in a cross-sectional study. MethodsFasting serum samples were obtained from 575 residents of Anniston who were not on any lipid-lowering medication and were analyzed for 35 PCB congeners, nine chlorinated pesticides, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. Associations between toxicant concentrations and lipid levels were determined using multiple linear regression analysis. ResultsWe observed that elevated serum concentrations of lipids were associated with elevated serum concentrations of 3 PCBs and summed pesticides in analyses adjusted for age, race, gender, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking and exercising status. The strongest associations were seen for PCB congeners with three, four, or at least eight substituted chlorines.

Serum concentrations of HCB and chlordane also had strong associations with lipid components. ConclusionsIncreased concentrations of PCBs and organochlorine pesticides are associated with elevations in total serum lipids, total cholesterol and triglycerides, but the patterns are different for different groups of PCBs and different pesticides. These observations show selective effects of different organochlorines on serum concentrations of different groups of lipids. This elevation in concentrations of serum lipids may be the basis for the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease found in persons with elevated exposures to PCBs and chlorinated pesticides. 5 U 50 TS 473215 /TS/ATSDR CDC HHS/United States 24325314 PMC 389349...|$|R

ConclusionsOur results support grouping PCB congeners based on their potential mechanism of action of enzyme induction when investigating associations with TH.

We found that the milk of Japanese primiparous and multiparous mothers was similarly contaminated with Co-PXB congeners. Co-PXBs time- and dose-dependently increased ethoxyresorufin-O-deethoxylase (EROD activity) in HepG 2 cells. The EROD activity of liver microsomes collected from C 57 BL/ 6 mice exposed to these <b>congeners</b> <b>substituted</b> with one or two, and with three or five bromine atoms time-dependently decreased and increased, respectively. These results indicate that introducing bromine into the chemical frame of a polychlorinated biphenyl tends to increase CYP 1 A activity in vitro and in vivo and that the number substituted bromine atoms alters the metabolism profiles.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate soil and air (gas and particle) transfer of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) to vegetation in residential and industrial areas. In a first part, soil-vegetation transfer was assessed. The levels of PCDD/Fs in 120 soil and 120 herbage samples collected from 1996 to 2002 in an industrial area of Montcada (Barcelona, Spain), near a municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI), were determined. Some additional individual samples were also evaluated. It was concluded that high soil concentrations, which are not at steady state with the air layer above it, show a tendency for PCDD/Fs to escape via volatilization. In a second part of the study, air-vegetation transfer was examined. PCDD/F concentrations from 24 herbage samples were used, while PCDD/F concentrations were also measured in seven high-volume air samples and seven passive air-vapor samples. Scavenging coefficients (m 3 air “sampled”/g grass d. m.) ranged from 1. 9 to 11. 3 m 3 /g. A good trend with KOA was observed for PCDDs (R = 0. 82), while it was lower for PCDFs (R = 0. 55). The current results corroborate that PCDD/F concentrations in vegetation are associated with atmospheric deposition. For the highest <b>substituted</b> PCDD/F <b>congeners,</b> the air-particle uptake from plants is the principal pathway. In regions impacted by combustion emission sources, PCDD/F gas–particle partitioning is influenced by a higher concentration of particles in the air. Particles and associated particle-bound PCDD/Fs would sorb to leaf surfaces, and are subject to removal via wash off. However, in areas where emissions to air are not very notable, vapor absorption would be the principal source of vegetation pollution. The results of this investigation can have a potential interest in risk assessment studies and environmental fate models.

First, CNT functionalized with amino groups (CNT-NH 2) were prepared via chemical modification of carboxylic groups introduced on the CNT surface. Secondly the covalent immobilization of CNT-NH 2 was carried out by using glutardialdehyde activating agent on aminopropyl (AP) -silica surface. This CNT stationary phase was applied to the HPLC separation of two molecule series, i. e. polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) isomers with different degrees of substitution in the ortho-position (<b>non-ortho</b> to tetra-ortho <b>substituted)</b> and terpenes (linalool, geraniol, thymol, -terpineol). The retention behavior of these solute molecules was measured under isocratic conditions with different mobile phase compositions, ranging from 0. 05 - 0. 70 v/v of toluene in cyclohexane. The retention factors of the solute molecule do not depend linearly on the toluene fraction but follow a quadratic relationship. This CNT stationary phase was a very useful column for the separation of PCB congeners and terpenes. It was demonstrated that a planar conformation of the solute molecule enhanced the solute retention on this CNT stationary phase. As well, a quantitative structure relationship derived, demonstrated the significant input to retention was due to the structurally selective dipole-dipole and charge transfer interactions with the solutes. These results were compared with those obtained on the AP stationary phase. The proposed CNT stationary phase for the separation possess distinctive and interesting retentive properties, and chemometric analysis of retention data of appropriate designed series of test solutes appears to be a convenient, objective and quantitative method to prove a new phase specificit...|$|R

Successive one-electron transfer steps were studied by means of cyclic voltammetry, EPR and UV-vis-NIR-IR spectroelectrochemistry. These studies show that the first oxidation mainly involves the central bis(alkynyl) ruthenium moiety with only limited effects on the appended vinyl ruthenium moieties. The second to fourth oxidations (n = 2, 3, 4) involve the entire carbon-rich conjugated path of the molecule with an increased charge uniformly distributed between the two arms of the molecules, including the terminal vinyl ruthenium sites. In order to assess the charge distribution, we judiciously use (13) CO labeled analogues to distinguish stretching vibrations due to the acetylide triple bonds and the intense and charge-sensitive Ru(CO) IR probe in different oxidation states. The comparison between complex pairs 4 a,b(n+) (n = 0 - 3), A(a,b) (n+) and V(a,b) (n+) (n = 0 - 2) serves to elucidate the effect of the methoxy donor substituents on the redox and spectroscopic properties of these systems in their various oxidation states and on the metal/ligand contributions to their frontier orbitals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPolybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDE) {{were widely}} used as flame retardants in plastics. There are highly persistent and bio-accumulative toxicants {{that came to}} the attention after their huge quantities had been released into the environment. Due to distinct similarity of PBDE to the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), the PBDE present a potential health hazard. In order to decrease the environmental impact of PBDEs and to stop their spread in the food chain the different degradation methods have been investigated. This work is focused on verification and comparison of the various dehalogenation methods of PBDE. In particular, the photochemical degradation reaction pathways of different selected <b>congeners</b> <b>substituted</b> with 1 to 10 bromines, in solvents are examined. Photochemical reaction is a non-invasive method with a high degradation potential. The photochemical reaction is conducted in batch or continuous reactors. Comparison of experimental results based on determination of individual reaction products shows the efficiency of the studied photochemical methods running in both reactor arrangements. New photochemical method employing the photochemical microreactor was investigated that has not been reported in the literature so far.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of bioremediation efforts is assessed traditionally {{from the loss}} of the chemical of interest. In some cases, analytical techniques are coupled with evaluation of toxicity to organisms representative of those found in the affected environment or surrogate organisms. Little is known, however, about the effect of remediation of environmental chemicals on potential toxicity to mammalian organisms. We discuss both an approach that employs mammalian cell system bioassays and the criteria for selection of the assays. This approach has been used to evaluate the biological response to mixtures of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) before and after remediation by reductive dechlorination. The dechlorination process used results in accumulation of <b>congeners</b> <b>substituted</b> in only the ortho and para positions and containing fewer chlorines than the starting mixtures. Evaluation of the dechlorinated mixture reveals a loss of biological activity that could be ascribed to coplanar PCBs not containing chlorine in the ortho positions. Conversely, biological activity associated with ortho-substituted PCB congeners is unaffected or increased by remediation. Thus, the results of the bioassays are consistent with the remediation-induced change in the profile of PCB congeners and the known mechanisms of action of PCBs. The results emphasize a need for evaluation of the products of remediation for biological activity in mammalian systems. Furthermore, th...|$|R
40|$|Quinones {{permeate}} our biotic environment, {{contributing to}} both homeostasis and cytotoxicity. All quinones generate {{reactive oxygen species}} through redox cycling, while partially substituted quinones also undergo arylation (Michael adduct formation) yielding covalent bonds with nucleophiles such as cysteinyl thiols. In contrast to reactive oxygen species, the role of arylation in quinone cytotoxicity is not well understood. We found that the arylating quinones, including unsubstituted 1, 4 -benzoquinone (1, 4 -BzQ) and partially <b>substituted</b> vitamin E <b>congener</b> γ-tocopherol quinone (γ-TQ), were cytotoxic, with γ-TQ > 1, 4 -BzQ, whereas the fully substituted nonarylating vitamin E congener α-tocopherol quinone was not. In vitro, both arylating quinones formed Michael adducts with the thiol nucleophile N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at rates where 1, 4 -BzQ > γ-TQ. In cultured cells, concurrent addition of NAC eliminated 1, 4 -BzQ caused toxicity, but preincubation was required for the same NAC detoxification effect on γ-TQ. These data clearly established the role of arylation in quinone toxicity and revealed that arylating quinone structure affects cytotoxicity by governing detoxification through the rate of adduct formation. Furthermore, arylating quinones induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by activating the pancreatic ER kinase (PERK) signaling pathway including elF 2 α, ATF 4, and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Detoxification by NAC greatly attenuates CHOP induction in arylating quinone-treated cells, suggesting that ER stress is a cellular mechanism for arylating quinone cytotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and {{dibenzofuran}} (PCDF) contamination of fish was widely associated with {{bleached kraft pulp}} mills. Regulations were put into place in Canada and elsewhere to reduce or eliminate {{the presence of these}} chemicals in pulp mill effluents. The industry quickly introduced treatment and process changes such as elemental (ECF) and total chlorine free (TCF) bleaching, which resulted in dramatically reduced PCDD/F concentrations in pulp mill effluents. However, PCDD/Fs may remain a concern for the receiving environment near bleached kraft pulp mills due to their tendency to persist in sediments and bioaccumulate in aquatic biota. Several studies conducted in the early 1990 s reported significantly elevated levels of PCDD/Fs in white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) exposed to bleached kraft mill effluent (BKME). Particularly high concentrations were observed in the receiving environment of two mills in northern Ontario. The first mill, located in the town of Terrace Bay, discharges effluent into Jackfish Bay, Lake Superior. The second mill is located in Smooth Rock Falls, Ontario and discharges effluent into the Mattagami River where effects have been observed in fish collected downstream of the pulp mill. Over time, both mills have undergone a number of process upgrades, including a transition to 100 % chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) substitution. In 2006 the Tembec Smooth Rock Falls Pulp and Paper Mill closed permanently, while the mill in Terrace Bay has gone through a number of temporary shutdowns and is currently in the process of transitioning to a dissolving pulp process. Temporal changes in PCDD/F contamination was examined in white sucker historically exposed to BKME in Jackfish Bay and the Mattagami River, following mill process changes and closures. Historical data was summarized from studies conducted in the 1990 s and analyzed along with liver tissue of male white sucker collected from each location in 2011 and 2012. The body burden of each fish was analysed using Toxic Equivalency (TEQ) calculations to account for concentration and relative toxicity of 2, 3, 7, 8 – <b>substituted</b> PCDD/F <b>congeners.</b> At Jackfish Bay, concentrations of PCDD/Fs in surface sediment and dated sediment cores were used to document the spatial and temporal pattern of PCDD/F contamination in relation to historical process upgrades and operational changes at the mill. PCDD/Fs measured in white sucker liver samples collected from Jackfish Bay during gonadal recrudescence in the fall illustrate a decrease in mean TEQ from 74. 2 ± 20. 9 pg∙g- 1 in 1991 to 3. 34 ± 2. 05 pg∙g- 1 in 2012. These values were slightly elevated compared to the remote reference location at Mountain Bay, Lake Superior, which exhibited a mean TEQ of 1. 88 ± 0. 45 pg∙g- 1 and 1. 06 ± 0. 69 pg∙g- 1 in white sucker collected in fall 2011 and 2012, respectively. Although below consumption guidelines, trace levels of PCDD/Fs persist in fish collected from Jackfish Bay and these concentrations are suspected to reflect sediment contamination in Moberly Bay (part of Jackfish Bay). A unique PCDD/F contaminant profile, dominated by 2, 3, 7, 8 – tetrachlorodibenzo–p–dioxin (TCDD) and dibenzofuran (TCDF), was observed in white sucker and sediment collected from Jackfish Bay. Analysis of surface sediment collected throughout Jackfish Bay revealed elevated PCDD/F concentrations, compared to reference areas in Lake Superior. TEQ values measured in surface sediment from the depositional areas of Moberly Bay exceeded the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) guidelines. In 1991 PCDD/F contamination, reported as mean TEQ, of white sucker collected downstream of the pulp mill outfall in Smooth Rock Falls reached levels of 111 ± 86. 2 pg∙g- 1. At the time, the mill utilized molecular chlorine (Cl 2) in the bleaching sequence and employed primary effluent treatment. A dramatic decline was observed in PCDD/F concentrations of fish collected in 1993 and 1995, corresponding to implementation of 100 % ClO 2 substitution in the bleaching process. PCDD/F contamination in white sucker collected from the Mattagami River in 2011 and 2012 were similar upstream (0. 53 – 1. 49 pg TEQ∙g- 1) and downstream (0. 75 – 2. 87 pg TEQ∙g- 1) of the historical pulp mill outfall at Smooth Rock Falls, suggesting a return to background condition following the 2006 mill closure. Levels of 2, 3, 7, 8 –TCDD and 2, 3, 7, 8 –TCDF in liver tissue of fish collected downstream declined drastically compared to concentrations measured in 1991. The PCDD/F congener profile observed in white sucker downstream in 2011 and 2012 was more similar to fish collected from the reference site upstream than exposed fish collected in 1991. No sediment depositional areas suitable for taking a core sample were found on the river downstream of Smooth Rock Falls {{due to the nature of}} the system. 	 This study supports the conclusion that particulate (POM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from continuous inputs of effluent were likely the primary source of PCDD/Fs to fish in these receiving environments, with only a small contribution from surface sediment. Results indicate a decreasing trend in PCDD/F contamination of white sucker historically exposed to bleached kraft pulp mill effluent in the receiving environments of Jackfish Bay and the Mattagami River, consistent with mill process upgrades to eliminate the use of elemental chlorine from the bleaching sequence. Current levels of PCDD/Fs measured in white sucker collected from these locations suggest a return to background condition...|$|R
