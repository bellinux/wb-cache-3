We could resolve three hole pockets <b>near</b> the <b>zone</b> center and an electron pocket <b>near</b> the <b>zone</b> corner in the case of FeTe 0. 5 Se 0. 5, whereas only two hole pockets <b>near</b> the <b>zone</b> center and an electron pocket <b>near</b> the <b>zone</b> corner are resolved in the case of Fe 0. 9 Ni 0. 1 Te 0. 5 Se 0. 5, suggesting that the hole pocket having predominantly the xy orbital character is very sensitive to the impurity scattering.

40|$|We {{assess whether}} forests {{contribute}} indirectly to the dietary diversity of rural households by supporting diverse agricultural production systems. We applied our study {{in a landscape}} mosaic in Southern Ethiopia that was divided into three zones of increasing distance to Munesa Forest - "near," "intermediate," and "distant. " A variety of research tools and methods, including remote sensing, participatory methods, farm survey, and yield assessment, were employed. Diets of households were more diverse in the <b>near</b> <b>zone</b> than {{in the other two}} zones (6. 58 ± 1. 21, 5. 38 ± 1. 02, and 4. 41 ± 0. 77 food groups consumed daily in the near, intermediate, and distant zones, respectively). This difference was not explained by food items collected from Munesa Forest but by biomass flows from the forest to farmlands. Munesa Forest contributed an average of 6. 13 ± 2. 90 tons of biomass per farm and per year to the farms in the <b>near</b> <b>zone,</b> in the form of feed and fuelwood. Feed from the forest allowed for larger livestock herds in the <b>near</b> <b>zone</b> compared with the other two zones, and fuelwood from the forest reduced the need to use cattle dung as fuel in the <b>near</b> <b>zone</b> compared with the two other zones. These two biomass flows contributed to the availability of more manure to farmers closer to the forest (908 ± 853 kg farm- 1, 771 ± 717 kg farm- 1, and 261 ± 487 kg farm- 1 in the near, intermediate, and distant zones, respectively). In turn, increased manure enabled a larger percentage of farms to cultivate a diversified homegarden (87, 64, and 39 % of farms in the near, intermediate, and distant zones, respectively).

40|$|Abstract. Results from {{helically}} symmetric {{scalar field}} models and first {{results from a}} convergent helically symmetric binary neutron star code are reported here; these are models stationary in the rotating frame of a source with constant angular velocity Ω. In the scalar field models and the neutron star code, helical symmetry leads {{to a system of}} mixed elliptic-hyperbolic character. The scalar field models involve nonlinear terms of the form ψ 3, (∇ψ) 2, and ψ□ψ that mimic nonlinear terms of the Einstein equation. Convergence is strikingly different for different signs of each nonlinear term; it is typically insensitive to the iterative method used; and it improves with an outer boundary in the <b>near</b> <b>zone.</b> In the neutron star code, one has no control on the sign of the source, and convergence has been achieved only for an outer boundary less than ∼ 1 wavelength from the source or for a code that imposes helical symmetry only inside a <b>near</b> <b>zone</b> of that size. The inaccuracy of helically symmetric solutions with appropriate boundary conditions should be comparable to the inaccuracy of a waveless formalism that neglects gravitational waves; and the (<b>near</b> <b>zone)</b> solutions we obtain for waveless and helically symmetric BNS codes with the same boundary conditions nearly coincide.
