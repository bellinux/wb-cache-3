The aim was to segment a sample of consumers in the southern Italian region of Campania {{on the basis of}} their degree of technophobia in the food sector. Our analysis was conducted using the psychometric scale proposed by Cox and Evans, the Food Technology Neophobia Scale (FTNS), applied to six categories of food products which had undergone various degrees of industrial handling and processing. The variables generated by the FTNS were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) which extracted four factors subsequently used for sample segmentation via an analysis of <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R

There is usually one main C.A.L.M. camp near the inner part of the gatherings and smaller first aid stations set up around the Gatherings. Even those without medical experience are encouraged to help with things such as procuring water and cooking for the healers, who are often too busy to attend main circle or visit other kitchens.

40|$|We regard {{clustering}} as a data assignment problem {{where the}} goal is to partition the data into several <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> of items. For solving this problem, we suggest an information-theoretic framework based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. Intuitively, the idea is that we group together those data items that can be compressed well together, so that the total code length over all the data groups is optimized. One can argue that as efficient compression is possible only when one has discovered underlying regularities that are common to all the members of a group, this approach produces an implicitly defined similarity metric between the data items. Formally the global code length criterion to be optimized is defined by using the intuitively appealing universal normalized maximum likelihood code which has been shown to produce optimal compression rate in an explicitly defined manner. The number of groups can be assumed to be unknown, and the problem of deciding the optimal number is formalized as part of the same theoretical framework. In the empirical part of the paper we present results that demonstrate the validity of the suggested clustering framework. 1. ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite, {{or perhaps}} because of, the lack of formal {{coordinating}} bodies, the movement manages to successfully organize large protests on a global basis, using information technology to spread information and organize. Protesters organize themselves into [...] "affinity groups," [...] typically <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> {{of people who live}} close together and share a common political goal. Affinity groups will then send representatives to planning meetings. However, because these groups can be infiltrated by law enforcement intelligence, important plans of the protests are often not made until the last minute. One common tactic of the protests is to split up based on willingness to break the law. This is designed, with varying success, to protect the risk-averse from the physical and legal dangers posed by confrontations with law enforcement. For example, in Prague during the anti-IMF and World Bank protests in September 2000 demonstrators split into three distinct groups, approaching the conference center from three directions: one engaging in various forms of civil disobedience (the Yellow march), one (the Pink/Silver march) advancing through [...] "tactical frivolity" [...] (costume, dance, theatre, music, and artwork), and one (the Blue march) engaging in violent conflicts with the baton-armed police, with the protesters throwing cobblestones lifted from the street.|$|R

Archaeological data was collected forming a corpus of surveyed and excavated sites and settlements, differentiated by type, size or time-scale of occupation. Reconstruction of the Neolithic landscape was based on synthesis of geological maps, records of stratigraphic data collected from a total of 400 boreholes and the indexing of past studies relative to the geomorphological changes that have affected Neolithic Thessaly from Holocene until today. These were spatially and statistically processed to estimate the amount of alluvial deposits and their distribution on the Thessalian plain from the Early Neolithic period to the present...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the performance of the Tuberculosis Control Program in municipalities of the State of São Paulo. METHODS This is a program evaluation research, with ecological design, which uses three <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> of the municipalities of the State of São Paulo according to their performance in relation to operational indicators. We have selected 195 municipalities with at least five new cases of tuberculosis notified in the Notification System of the State of São Paulo and with 20, 000 inhabitants or more in 2010. The multiple correspondence analysis was used to identify the association between the groups of different performances, the epidemiological and demographic characteristics, and the characteristics of the health systems of the municipalities. RESULTS The group with the worst performance showed the highest rates of abandonment (average [avg] = 10. 4, standard deviation [sd] = 9. 4) and the lowest rates of supervision of Directly Observed Treatment (avg = 6. 1, sd = 12. 9), and it was associated with low incidence of tuberculosis, high tuberculosis and HIV, small population, high coverage of the Family Health Strategy/Program of Community Health Agents, and being located on the countryside. The group with the best performance presented the highest cure rate (avg = 83. 7, sd = 10. 5) and the highest rate of cases in Directly Observed Treatment (avg = 83. 0, sd = 12. 7); the group of regular performance showed regular results for outcome (avg cure = 79. 8, sd = 13. 2; abandonment avg = 9. 5, sd = 8. 3) and supervision of the Directly Observed Treatment (avg = 42. 8, sd = 18. 8). Large population, low coverage of the Family Health Strategy/Program of Community Health Agents, high incidence of tuberculosis and AIDS, and being located on the coast and in metropolitan areas were associated with these groups. CONCLUSIONS The findings highlight the importance of the Directly Observed Treatment in relation to the outcome for treatment and raise reflections on the structural and managerial capacity of municipalities in the implementation of the Tuberculosis Control Program...|$|R

As in forms on Neopaganism elsewhere, some pagans work as solitary practitioners and others form groups such as covens. Covens may or not be hierarchical, depending on the tradition. Gardnerian and Alexandrian covens tend to be hierarchical, with coven led by a Priest and High Priestess.

40|$|In New Zealand {{specialist}} {{courses in}} the arts at undergraduate level, and one year diplomas in teaching have been reduced. Visual art advisory time allocated to primary school teachers has also been reduced. As a result teachers' confidence in teaching visual art is under threat. This study focused {{on a group of}} generalist primary school teachers as they worked to develop their confidence in the teaching of visual art. They worked as a <b>non-hierarchical</b> collaborative <b>group,</b> using action research to analyse the voices of the children in their school, and to reflect on their own practice. Following their reflections they used their developed confidence to develop a visual art self-assessment system. Their developed confidence in teaching visual art enabled them to offer support in the teaching of visual art to other teachers within the school. However, the narrow focus of the study did not allow exploration of why the participants were motivated to develop their expertise in the teaching of visual art. The limitations of the data also failed to reveal whether the participants were able to sustain their collaborative working relationship after the study ended. The study recommends further research into the long-term sustainability of teacher collaborative groups and the motivation that enables teachers to develop their confidence in the teaching of visual art...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses longstanding sociological {{questions about}} organizational {{democracy in the}} context of contemporary advances in digital technology. To date, most of the scholarship on digital activism suggests that the Internet enables social movements to be less hierarchical, more participatory, and more egalitarian. However, such claims are weakened by researchers' tendency to study only high levels of digital activism, rather than investigating digital practices across a range of organizations with differing levels of digital engagement. In contrast, I explore political, labor and social movement organizations across an entire political field. My units of analysis are the 34 groups in North Carolina active on both sides of a political issue: public employee collective bargaining rights. The organizations range from Tea Parties to rank-and-file labor unions and from conservative think tanks to progressive coalitions. I collected data on over 60, 000 Tweets, Facebook posts and Web site metrics of the organizations. I then created an index to measure the extent of digital engagement of each group, and I developed a typology of online social movement activities and platforms. An analysis using this index indicates that rather than digital technologies simply shaping social movements, I find that social movement organizational differences affect Internet use. Groups that are more hierarchical, conservative, reformist and composed of middle and upper class members {{are much more likely to}} have higher digital activism levels than less hierarchical, progressive, radical and working class organizations. Using in-depth interviews, ethnographic observations, and content analysis, I also uncover the mechanisms of these digital differences. First, contrary to the literature that suggests that digital activism is tied to <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>groups,</b> I find that groups that are more hierarchical and bureaucratic have the infrastructure to develop and maintain online organizational engagement. Next, rather than the typical image of the digital activist as a left-wing radical, the highest digital activism levels are among right-wing groups because of what I call their organizing ideology: their ideas and practices of liberty and spreading the truth align with their Internet use. In turn, reformist groups embrace the Internet to reach those in power in their lobbying efforts while radical groups simply treat digital technology as one of many tools for mass organizing, resulting in lower digital activism levels. Finally, digital activism is not an egalitarian participatory space due to low costs of entry because of a social class gap, which derives from the high costs of online participation, as well as power and entitlement differences between working-class and middle-to-upper class groups. This study demonstrates that the Internet does not render obsolete sociological theories of collective action, oligarchy, and stratification. Instead, this research points to how ideology, hierarchy and inequality shape Internet use, challenging the theories of digital democracy...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the weeks}} prior to the parade this year there was some {{friction}} between the Fremont Arts Council, the official parade organizers, and the cyclist organizers, a <b>non-hierarchical</b> consensus <b>group</b> that comes together once a year and has no formal organization. The FAC wanted the cyclists to become official members of the parade and under their control. The cyclist group are basically anarchists {{in the way they}} operate and said [...] "no". They agreed to disagree and things went on as usual with close cooperation between the two groups.The numbers dwindled this year as the day dawned cold and damp. A seasoned group of 10 volunteers once again opened the gates to the large, group paint party at a private marina in the 4100 block of Shilshole Ave. N.W. At an entry portal donations were taken and only people who were cyclists to be painted or their painters were allowed to enter. Over several hours 600 clothed cyclists entered and at noon 600 cold (but exuberant) painted naked cyclists exited. The group rode through the Ballard neighborhood and then on to the Fremont Solstice Parade route where they were joined by approximately 100 more painted cyclists from private paint parties. After subtracting expenses, the organized paint party group was able to donate $2,000 to the Fremont Arts Council to help defray the parade costs the following spring.|$|R
