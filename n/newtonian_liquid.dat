We present a lubrication model for the closure of holes which is in good agreement with the experiments in <b>Newtonian</b> <b>liquids.</b> The growth rate of growing holes in suspensions is found to scale with the particle diameter over the suspending liquid viscosity. Comparing closing holes in <b>Newtonian</b> <b>liquids</b> to growing holes in dense suspensions we find a sinusoidal, linear response in the first, and a highly non-linear one in the latter.

40|$|Probe-tack {{experiments}} of Tirumkudulu [Phys. Fluids 15, 1588 (2003) ] {{have shown}} that squeeze flow of <b>Newtonian</b> <b>liquids</b> on flat, impermeable substrates can be successfully modeled using the lubrication approximation. Here, we present a model for squeeze flow of <b>Newtonian</b> <b>liquids</b> on porous substrates where the flow in the gap is coupled to the fluid flow in the porous media. The competition of spreading and imbibition of liquid on a partially saturated porous substrate determines the force versus gap profile in both the squeeze (compression) and pull-off (tension) modes. The finite difference method was used to discretize the lubrication equation in the gap while boundary element method was employed to solve for flow in the porous substrate. The model predicts a lower magnitude of force for porous substrates in both compression and tension modes compared to that for impermeable substrates. Experiments on porous alumina substrates with <b>Newtonian</b> <b>liquids</b> show close agreement with the model predictions in both compression and tension modes when the gap is corrected for the obliqueness of the confining surfaces. Cavitation is predicted for some cases in the tension mode when the pressure in the gap reduced below the vapor pressure of liquid. (c) 200...|$|R

This non-contact method applies an oscillating extensional stress. Acoustic rheometers measure the sound speed and attenuation of ultrasound {{for a set of}} frequencies in the megahertz range. Sound speed is a measure of system elasticity. It can be converted into fluid compressibility. Attenuation is a measure of viscous properties. It can be converted into viscous longitudinal modulus. In the case of a <b>Newtonian</b> <b>liquid,</b> attenuation yields information on the volume viscosity. This type of rheometer works at much higher frequencies than others. It is suitable for studying effects with much shorter relaxation times than any other rheometer.|$|E
50|$|Constant {{viscosity}} elastic liquids, {{also known}} as Boger fluids are elastic fluids with constant viscosity. This creates an effect in the fluid where it flows like a liquid, yet behaves like an elastic solid when stretched out. Most elastic fluids exhibit shear thinning (viscosity decreases as shear strain is applied), because they are solutions containing polymers. But Boger fluids are exceptions since they are highly dilute solutions, so dilute that shear thinning caused by the polymers can be ignored. Boger fluids are made primarily by adding {{a small amount of}} polymer to a Newtonian fluid with a high viscosity, a typical solution being polyacrylamide mixed with corn syrup. It is a simple compound to synthesize but important to the study of rheology because elastic effects and shear effects can be clearly distinguished in experiments using Boger fluids. Without Boger fluids, it was difficult to determine if a non-Newtonian effect was caused by elasticity, shear thinning, or both; non-Newtonian flow caused by elasticity was rarely identifiable. Since Boger fluids can have constant viscosity, an experiment can be done where the results of the flow rates of a Boger liquid and a <b>Newtonian</b> <b>liquid</b> with the same viscosity can be compared, and the difference in the flow rates would show the change caused by the elasticity of the Boger liquid.|$|E
