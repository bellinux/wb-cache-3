40|$|The German Capital Markets Model Case Act (KapMuG) and its {{amendment}} of 2012 highlight some {{fundamentals of}} collective redress in civil law countries at {{the example of}} model case procedures {{in the field of}} investor protection. That is why a survey of the ongoing activities of the European Union in the area of collective redress and of its repercussions on the member state level forms a suitable basis for the following analysis of the 2012 amendment of the KapMuG. It clearly brings into focus a shift from sector-specific regulation with an emphasis on the cross-border aspect of protecting consumers towards a “coherent approach” strengthening the enforcement of EU law. As a result, regulatory policy and collective redress are {{two sides of the same}} coin today. With respect to the KapMuG such a development brings about some tension between its aim to aggregate small individual claims as efficiently as possible and the dominant role of individual procedural rights in German civil procedure. This conflict can be illustrated by some specific rules of the KapMuG: its scope of application, the three-tier procedure of a model case procedure, the newly introduced <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> and the new opt-out settlement under the amended §§ 17 - 19...|$|R
40|$|Model case {{procedures}} have some fundamentals {{in common with}} collective redress in civil law countries. This is particularly true {{in the field of}} investor protection which is highly regulated and marked by resulting enforcement failures, which led the German legislator to the enactment of the KapMuG and its recent amendment which highlight exemplary elements of model case procedure.

50|$|The Series 2 Check is {{impossible}} to lose and has an intuitive weighing feature. The user can track its whereabouts at all time with real GPS+3G location tracking, especially after check-in and before baggage claim, when a traveler is separated from it. As {{a result of its}} location alerts, users of the Bluesmart Series 2 Check will get <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> which baggage <b>claim</b> carousel/belt was assigned to their flight or if the airline accidentally flew their bag to the wrong destination. The Series 2 Check is locked with the Bluesmart App meaning nobody else can open it without the user's permission except for TSA agents during security checks as it comes with a TSA Approved Lock. The four built-in sensors located in the back bumpers work as a scale when the suitcase is lying face up, delivering accurate weight data to the Bluesmart App in real-time without having to stand it upright or lifting it. The built-in sensors also sync with airline weight restrictions to make sure that its users don’t have to pay baggage fees.|$|R

40|$|As part of Australian {{licensing}} requirements professional valuers {{are required to}} maintain a level of professional indemnity insurance. A core feature of any insurance cover is that the insured {{has an obligation to}} notify their insurer of both actual and potential claims. An actual claim clearly will impact upon future policies and premiums paid. <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> a potential <b>claim,</b> whether or not the notification crystallises into an actual claim, also can have an impact upon the insured’s claims history and premiums. The Global Financial Crisis continues to impact upon business practices and land transactions both directly and indirectly. The Australian valuation profession is not exempt from this impact. One example of this ongoing impact is reflected in a worrying practice engaged in by some financial institutions in respect of their loan portfolios. That is, even though the mortgagor is not in default, some institutions are pre-emptively issuing notices of demand regarding potential losses. Further, in some instances such demands are based only on mass appraisal valuations without specific consideration being given to the individual lot in question. The author examines the impact of this practice for the valuation profession and seeks to provide guidance for the appropriate handling of such demands...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R
