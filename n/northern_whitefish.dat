40|$|In {{this work}} was tested optimal rearing {{protocol}} for <b>Northern</b> <b>whitefish</b> larvae in two experiments. Both experiments lasted for 34 days. In the first experiment the effect of feed particle size on the survival and growth were tested in <b>Northern</b> <b>whitefish</b> larvae with initial body weight of 3. 01 +- 0. 48 mg. Larvae were weaned from live feed 10 th, 15 th, 20 th, 25 th and 30 th day after hatching when co-feeding was took for 3 days before the weaning. In the first experiment were tested particle size of 100 micrometers and 300 micrometers. Groups weaned 20 th, 25 th and 30 th with 100 micrometers feed and groups weaned 25 th and 30 th with 300 micrometers feed had similar final survival (without significant differences). The best growth (final weight 39 +- 12 mg) had group weaned 30 th day after hatching using particle size of 300 micrometers. In the second experiment the effect of length of combined feeding (co-feeding) on the survival and growth were tested in <b>Northern</b> <b>whitefish</b> larvae on a unit weight 3. 01 +- 0. 48 mg. Co-feeding lasted for 1, 3 or 6 days before the weaning. Larvae were weaned from live feed 10 th, 15 th, 20 th, 25 th and 30 th days after hatching. Groups weaned 10 th, 15 th, 20 th, 25 th and 30 th had similar final survival (without significant differences). But the best growth (final weight 37 +- 15 mg) reached group weaned 30 th day after hatching with combined feeding for one day. Groups weaned 20 th, 25 th and 30 th had similar final body weight (without significant differences). There was no observed effect of co-feeding duration on survival and growth...|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{asynchrony}} {{of sexual}} maturation {{is characteristic of}} salmonid females, and, for various reasons, the spawning season can be extended for 4 months, although it generally extends over a 3 week to 2 month period, as in brook trout and <b>northern</b> <b>whitefish.</b> In aquaculture, to ensure high fertilization and egg survival rates, {{it is recommended that}} identification of ovulating females be undertaken at least twice weekly. This is time-consuming when keeping large numbers of broodstock with an extended spawning season, and risk of stress damage to fish increases. Ensuring sufficient Arctic grayling broodstock relies on capture of wild animals from natural waters before onset of the spawning season. Capture and long-term holding of wild stocks is associated with high pre-spawning mortality. Due to the high ovulation synchronizing effect, GnRHa is practical for induction of ovulation 1 ? 1. 5 months prior to the natural spawning season. This work focused on optimization of methods of hormone-controlled reproduction using GnRHa in brook trout, <b>northern</b> <b>whitefish,</b> and Arctic grayling from Siberia. Because this is the first report of use of GnRHa in these species, emphasis was on optimization of the hormone dose and delivery method along with assessment of effects of GnRHa treatment on postspawning broodstock mortality, egg size, and egg viability. As in other salmonids, GnRHa treatment effectively synchronizes the onset of ovulation in brook trout and <b>northern</b> <b>whitefish.</b> This gives accurate information about ovulatory status of the broodstock and enables planning of the stripping schedule. The most convenient methods were the double acute injection at 25 ?g. kg- 1 ?-Arg 6,Pro 9 -NHEt-sGnRHa administered 3 days apart and injection of 25 ?g. kg- 1 of emulsified ?-Arg 6,Pro 9 -NHEt-sGnRHa in Freund´s incomplete adjuvant, which prolongs and more effectively stimulates LH secretion and requires only a single injection. Double acute injection at 10 ?g. kg- 1 of ?-Tle 6,Pro 9 -NHEt-mGnRHa (Supergestran) was sufficient to induce ovulation in Arctic grayling 1 ? 1. 5 months prior to natural spawning, and enabled accelerated stripping and return of wild broodstock to their natural habitat. Single acute injection proved to be ineffective or unreliable in most cases and therefore cannot be recommended. No negative effect of GnRHa or GnRHa-FIA treatments on post-spawning mortality of broodstock was observed. It has to be noted that that to the extent of law Nr. 166 / 1999 statute book (Czech veterinary law) injective procedures can be carried out just by the veterinarian or by a verinarian-authorized person in veterinarian presence. GnRHa treatment has side-effects and alters egg quality. Apart from in brook trout, egg survival was significantly lower (5 ? 20 %) in treated females. Increased hormone dose did not influence egg survival at the levels tested. Egg and hatchling size was lower in treated females compared to untreated specimens irrespective of dose or hormone delivery method. Reduced egg size is, however, not the likely source of reduced viability. In general, our results corroborate results of studies dealing with assessment of effects of hormone treatment on egg quality. Based on current experimental designs it is impossible to identify the cause of the side-effects with certainty. Solving this problem should be priority for future research...|$|E
40|$|Freshwater fish {{production}} is {{significantly correlated with}} water temperature, {{which is expected to}} increase under climate change and affect fish growth, productivity, and survival. This study deals with estimating the change in water temperature in productive ponds and its impact on fishery in the Czech Republic. The target fish species were common carp (Cyprinus carpio), maraena whitefish (Coregonus maraena), <b>northern</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus peled), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). It was hypothesized that there would be an increasing risk of high water temperature stress for fish. Water temperature calculations based on 3 -day means of air temperature were tested in several ponds in three major fish production areas. The verified model was applied to the climate change conditions determined by standardized scenarios derived from the five global circulation models MPEH 5, CSMK 3, IPCM 4, GFCM 21, and HADGEM. The results for changed climate indicated limitations for Czech fish farming in terms of prolonged periods with fish temperature stress as well as the increased number of stress periods and increased number of days within these periods. It is very likely that Czech fishery will have to change the fish species farmed in particular productive areas. In particular, higher altitudes are likely to become less suitable for the Salmonidae...|$|E

50|$|Fish {{account for}} about 80% of the diet of the common loon.

Locals (including the First Nations, or Aboriginal Peoples) historically engaged in hunting and fishing for food. As such, whitetail deer, moose, ducks and geese were and are the primary quarry for local hunting. Ruffed and spruce grouse are popular upland game birds. Snowshoe hare is a tradition catch for women and children. Walleye (pickerel), <b>northern</b> pike, <b>whitefish</b> and lake trout were the primary food fish species. Outfitting and sport hunting is still focused on whitetail and moose. Black bear and wolf {{are becoming more and}} more desirable for non-resident hunters, especially those from Europe and the USA.
