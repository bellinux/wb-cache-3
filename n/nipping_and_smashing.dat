40|$|The aims of this {{research}} is to synthesize Pb(II) imprinted polymers with carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) as polymers and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) as cross-linker (Pb-IIP). Chitosan (CTS), non imprinted polymer (<b>NIP)</b> <b>and</b> Pb-IIP were characterized using infrared (IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area analyzer (SAA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The result showed that the adsorption was optimum at pH 5 and contact time of 250 min. Adsorption of Pb(II) ion with all of adsorbents followed pseudo-second order kinetic equation. Adsorption of Pb(II) ion on CTS followed Freundlich isotherm while that on <b>NIP</b> <b>and</b> Pb-IIP followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The adsorbent of Pb-IIP give higher capacity than the <b>NIP</b> <b>and</b> CTS. Adsorption capacity of Pb-IIP, <b>NIP</b> <b>and</b> CTS were 167. 1, 128. 9 and 76. 1 mg/g, respectively. NIP gave higher adsorption selectivity for Pb(II) /Ni(II) and Pb(II) /Cu(II), whereas Pb-IIP showed higher adsorption selectivity for Pb(II) /Cd(II).

40|$|Sinonasal {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SSCC) and nasal inverted papilloma (NIP) represent the predominant type of malignant and benign tumors in sinonasal tract, respectively. CD 4 + CD 25 + Foxp 3 + natural regulatory T (Treg) cells might play critical role(s) in the suppression of anti-tumor immune response and thus shed light on tumor progression from benign to malignant. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency and suppressive capacity of Treg cells in SSCC compared to <b>NIP</b> <b>and</b> further to explore the underlying mechanisms. Frequencies of Treg, Th 1 and Th 2 cells were evaluated by flow cytometry in tissue homogenate and peripheral blood from 31 SSCC patients, 32 <b>NIP</b> patients <b>and</b> 35 normal controls. Treg cells were tested for regulatory function by co-culture with effector T cells. CCR 4 and its ligands, CCL 22 and CCL 17, were analyzed by flow cytometry and Luminex, respectively. The chemoattractant properties of CCR 4 /CCL 22 and CCR 4 /CCL 17 for Treg cells were assessed using the Boyden chamber technique, to elucidate the potential mechanisms of Treg recruitment in tumor microenvironment. Treg cells induction via TGF-β was assessed with transwells after local CD 4 + Foxp 3 + T cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry and TGF-β concentration was measured by Luminex. Tumor-infiltrating Treg cells increased significantly from normal to NIP to SSCC (P ≤ 0. 001 for normal vs. <b>NIP</b> <b>and</b> P = 0. 004 for NIP vs. SSCC). Significantly elevated frequency and enhanced suppression capacity of circulating Treg cells in SSCC were detected compared to <b>NIP</b> <b>and</b> healthy controls, concomitant with Th 1 decrease and Th 2 increase. Apparently increased CCL 22 attracted CCR 4 -expressing Treg cells to tumor microenvironment in SSCC, compared to NIP. SSCC produced significantly more TGF-β than <b>NIP</b> <b>and</b> thus possessed greater potential for Treg cell induction. Frequency and suppressive capacity of Treg cells enhanced with progression of malignancy from NIP to SSCC. Circulating Treg cells were recruited to tumor tissue via CCR 4 /CCL 22 signalling, whereas tumor-synthesised TGF-β contributed to induction of peripheral Treg cells...|$|R
