5|$|The first twelve stamps, the low {{values up to}} 1 shilling, {{were issued}} during 1922–1923, while the three high values, 2/6, 5/- and 10/-, did not appear until 8 September 1937. Designs included: Sword of Light, Map of Ireland, Celtic Cross, Arms of the Four Provinces and St. Patrick. Watermark and extra values were made until <b>new</b> <b>designs,</b> known as the Gerl definitives, using early Irish art motifs, were {{produced}} in 1968. These were the first <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> in 31 years for the high values and 46 years for the low values. The Gerl series was denominated initially in pre-decimal Irish pounds and later in decimal currency (both watermarked issues). It latterly appeared as unwatermarked stamps.|$|E

40|$|Workers in {{a bucket}} brigade {{production}} system perform unproductive travel when they walk to get more work from their colleagues. We introduce a <b>new</b> <b>design</b> of bucket brigades to reduce unproductive travel. Under the <b>new</b> <b>design,</b> each worker works {{on one side of}} an aisle when he proceeds in one direction and works on the other side when he proceeds in the reverse direction. We propose simple rules for workers to share work under the <b>new</b> <b>design</b> and find a sufficient condition for the system to self-balance. Numerical examples suggest that the improvement in throughput by the <b>new</b> <b>design</b> can be as large as 30 %. Even with a 20 % reduction in labor, the <b>new</b> <b>design</b> can still increase throughput by 7 %...|$|R

5|$|Boosey & Company diversified into {{manufacturing}} woodwind {{instruments in}} 1851, collaborating in 1856 with flautist R.S. Pratten (1846–1936) to develop <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> for flutes. The firm bought over {{the business of}} Henry Distin in 1868, allowing it to begin making brass instruments. Among its achievements was the widely acclaimed design for compensating valves developed by David James Blaikley in 1874. The company also commenced production of string instruments.|$|E
5|$|Gliding did {{not return}} to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a {{shortage}} of gliders, and the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of <b>new</b> <b>designs.)</b> The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Burchard was succeeded as Mint {{director}} by James Kimball. The {{new director}} was {{more receptive to}} Gilder's ideas and in 1887 announced a competition for <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> for the non-gold coinage. These plans were scuttled when Vermont Senator Justin Morrill questioned the Mint's authority to produce <b>new</b> <b>designs.</b> The Mint had claimed authority under the Coinage Act of 1873 in issuing the Morgan dollar in 1878 and the Liberty Head nickel in 1883. Morrill was a supporter of coin redesign and {{had in the past}} introduced bills to accomplish this; he felt, however, that this could not be done without an act of Congress. Kimball submitted the issue to government lawyers; they indicated that the Mint lacked the claimed authority. All three men worked to secure a bill to authorize new designs: Morrill by introducing and pressing legislation, Kimball by lobbying for the authority in his annual report, and Gilder by orchestrating favorable coverage. With legislators busy with other matters, it was not until September 26, 1890 that President Benjamin Harrison signed legislation making all denominations of U.S. coins available for immediate redesign by the Mint upon obtaining the Secretary of the Treasury's approval. Each coin could thereafter be altered from the 25th year after it was first produced; for example, a coin first struck in 1892 would be eligible for redesign in 1916.|$|E

After diplomatic protests, this was modified slightly; the original bids were kept, but alterations to attempt to conform to the new desired characteristics were allowed.|$|E
5|$|Richard Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME of the SECR in 1913, following {{the retirement of}} Harry Wainwright due to ill health. Wainwright left a legacy of competent but unspectacular locomotives that struggled {{to cope with the}} increased train lengths and loadings. Maunsell took control of the short-term situation by improving existing designs, and he introduced new engines to progressively replace obsolete classes. <b>New</b> <b>designs</b> could also cut costs on the SECR, as one capable mixed-traffic locomotive could undertake the work of two separate passenger or freight types. The first new design was to become Maunsell's Nclass 2-6-0.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland {{and a lot of}} <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> and backgrounds had to be created for the wilderness scenes. The backgrounds were designed by animator Debbie Silver. The design of the forest ranger was based on then-Vice President Al Gore. In the episode, Marge watches an old film which includes a comment from naturalist John Muir. The impression of Muir was done by Dan Castellaneta, who originally based the voice on an impersonator he met at Yosemite National Park. However, the producers asked him to make the voice older and crazier.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the participatory design process {{of a new}} bricklayer’s trowel. The process consisted of five steps: 1) identifying ergonomic problems, 2) generating ideas for <b>new</b> <b>design,</b> 3) evaluation of five test models, 4) Field-study to compare to prototypes with the traditional trowel en 5) Implementation of the new trowel. Masonry workers were involved in all steps of the process, except during step 2 generating ideas for <b>new</b> <b>design.</b> This project resulted in three new products: a totally <b>new</b> <b>designed</b> trowel, a redesign of the sabre and a redesign of the traditional trowel. The traditional trowel was also redesigned. The reason for this was that the <b>new</b> <b>designed</b> trowel would hardly {{be accepted by the}} current generation masonry workers, because it needs another working technique. The redesigned trowel fits the requirements of the masonry workers and from an ergonomically point of view it is better than the traditional trowel, but worse than the <b>new</b> <b>design...</b>|$|R
5|$|Turbines {{offered more}} power than {{reciprocating}} engines for the same volume of machinery. This, along with a guarantee on the new machinery from the inventor, Charles Parsons, persuaded the Royal Navy to use turbines in Dreadnought. It is often said that turbines had the additional benefits of being cleaner and more reliable than reciprocating engines. By 1905, <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> of reciprocating engine were available which were cleaner and more reliable than previous models.|$|E
5|$|WS-110 was {{redesigned}} as {{an aircraft}} flying Mach3 {{for the entire}} mission. Zip fuel was retained for the engine's afterburner to increase range. Both North American and Boeing returned <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> with very long fuselages and large delta wings. They differed primarily in engine layout; the NAA design arranged its six engines in a semi-circular duct under the rear fuselage, while the Boeing design used separate podded engines located individually on pylons below the wing, like the Hustler.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} {{drive to}} beautify the coinage, five {{denominations}} of US coins had received <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> between 1907 and 1909. In 1911, Taft administration officials decided to replace Charles E. Barber's Liberty Head design for the nickel, and commissioned Fraser to do the work. They were impressed by Fraser's designs showing a Native American and an American bison. The designs were approved in 1912, but were delayed several months because of objections from the Hobbs Manufacturing Company, which made mechanisms to detect slugs in nickel-operated machines. The company was not satisfied by changes made in the coin by Fraser, and in February 1913, Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh decided to issue the coins despite the objections.|$|E
40|$|Recently a <b>new</b> <b>design</b> methodology, Environment-Based Design (EBD) [1, 2] {{has been}} developed. In using {{the model of}} EBD, three {{elements}} are important: primitive synthesis knowledge, primitive environment and primitive solutions. Based on the three elements, three design strategies have been validated in [3] for generating <b>new</b> <b>design</b> solutions: formulating design problems differently, changing the sequence of decomposition of the design problem and extending synthesis knowledge. Increasing the possibilities of generating <b>new</b> <b>design</b> solutions may increase the chance of getting creative design solutions. Thus the three strategies for leading to <b>new</b> <b>design</b> solutions can be introduced into our engineering design education for helping and inspiring students generate creative design solutions. In this paper, we will first briefly introduce EBD model and the three design strategies leading to <b>new</b> <b>design</b> solutions, then explain how EBD can {{be integrated into the}} design education of engineering students and elaborate how the design strategies can be used to help students generate different design solutions. ...|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} 1880s, there were {{increasing}} {{calls for the}} replacement of the Seated Liberty design, used since the 1830s on most denominations of silver coins. In 1891, Mint Director Edward O. Leech, having been authorized by Congress to approve coin redesigns, ordered a competition, seeking a new look for the silver coins. As only the winner would receive a cash prize, invited artists refused to participate and no entry from the public proved suitable. Leech instructed Barber to prepare <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> for the dime, quarter, and half dollar, and after the chief engraver made changes to secure Leech's endorsement, they were approved by President Benjamin Harrison in November 1891. Striking of the new coins began the following January.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the districts}} include Norman- or medieval-era churches, {{many of which}} are {{included}} in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic architecture church towers. The prolific construction of the towers—some started before 1360—was typically accomplished by a master mason and a small team of itinerant masons, supplemented by local parish labourers, according to Poyntz Wright. But other authors reject this model, suggesting instead that leading architects designed the parish church towers based on early examples of Perpendicular design and ornamentation developed for cathedrals—their most important commissions. Contract builders carried out the plans, adding a distinctive mix of innovative details and decorations as <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> emerged over the years. These are included in the List of towers in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|From 1910 {{until his}} death from typhoid fever in 1912, Wilbur took the {{leading role in the}} patent struggle, {{traveling}} incessantly to consult with lawyers and testify in what he felt was a moral cause, particularly against Curtiss, who was creating a large company to manufacture aircraft. The Wrights' preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on <b>new</b> <b>designs,</b> and by 1911 Wright airplanes were considered inferior to those of European makers. Indeed, aviation development in the U.S. was suppressed {{to such an extent that}} when the U.S. entered World War I no acceptable American-designed airplanes were available, and U.S. forces were compelled to use French machines. Orville and Katharine Wright believed Curtiss was partly responsible for Wilbur's premature death, which occurred in the wake of his exhausting travels and the stress of the legal battle.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, a new Mint director, Robert W. Woolley, took office. Woolley {{advocated}} {{the replacement of}} the silver coins when it was legal to do so, and instructed Barber and Morgan to prepare <b>new</b> <b>designs.</b> He consulted with the Commission of Fine Arts, asking them to examine the designs produced by the Mint's engravers and, if they felt they were not suitable, to recommend artists to design the new coins. The Commission rejected the Barber and Morgan designs and proposed Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil, and Albin Polasek as designers. Although Woolley had hoped that each artist would produce one design, different concepts by Weinman were accepted for the dime and half dollar, and one by MacNeil for the quarter.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Pingali Venkayya {{submitted}} thirty <b>new</b> <b>designs,</b> in {{the form}} of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right, on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 {{the general}} {{design of the}} {{banknotes}} was reviewed {{to keep up with}} advancing technologies against counterfeiting, which resulted in the release of two new denominations ($50 and $100) between 1994 and 1995, also to counter the effects of consumer price inflation, which peaked at 41.6% in 1992. Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level and identification marks for the visually impaired were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer. The $5, $10 and $20 banknotes were also revised with the <b>new</b> <b>designs</b> in 1997, whilst the $2 banknote was and replaced by a coin in the same year with the $5 denomination undergoing the same process in August 2001.|$|E
