This dissertation {{focuses on the}} metallo-dielectric type of metal-clad <b>nanolasers.</b> To understand the quantum effects in nanoscale semiconductor lasers, a formal treatment of the Purcell effect, which describes the modification of the spontaneous emission rate by a sub-wavelength cavity, is first presented. This formalism is developed for the transparent medium condition, using the emitter-field-reservoir model in the quantum theory of damping, and its utility is demonstrated through the analysis and design of <b>nanolasers.</b> Next, the design, fabrication, and characterization of metallo- dielectric lasers under electrical pumping are discussed. To achieve <b>nanolasers</b> with optimal performance, different active medium materials are compared, and, it is shown that that the commonly suggested multiple quantum well (MQW) structure may not be suitable for <b>nanolasers.</b> The interplay of various temperature-dependent parameters, {{as well as their}} effects on optical mode and emission characteristics are subsequently studied. Building on this knowledge, electrically pumped metallo-dielectric <b>nanolasers</b> amenable to room temperature operation are designed, with the focus on minimizing thermal heating and threshold gain.

These oriented single crystals are being used in semiconductor nanowire devices such as diodes, transistors, logic circuits, lasers and sensors. Since nanowires have one dimensional structure meaning large surface to volume ratio, the diffusion resistance decreases. In addition, their efficiency in electron transport which is due to the quantum confinement effect, make their electrical properties be influenced by minor perturbation. Therefore, use of these nanowires in nanosensor elements increases the sensitivity in electrode response. As mentioned above, one dimensionality and chemical flexibility of the semiconductor nanowires make them applicable in <b>nanolasers.</b> Peidong Yang and his co-workers have done some research on room-temperature ultraviolet nanowire <b>nanolasers</b> in which the significant properties of these <b>nanolasers</b> have been mentioned.

40|$|In this article, we {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} a dielectric <b>nanolaser</b> that is nanoscopic in all spatial dimensions. Our proposal is based on dielectric nanoparticles of high refractive index, e. g., silicon, acting as a (passive) cavity (without intrinsic gain) that is decorated with a thin film of organic gain media. Its resonance frequencies can be tuned over the entire visible range and bright and dark modes can be addressed. So called "magnetic" modes can be utilized, which makes this dielectric <b>nanolaser</b> a complementary source of coherent nearfields similar to the surface plasmon laser (which exploits electric modes). The small intrinsic losses in silicon yield relatively high quality factors and low non-radiative decay rates of emitters close to the cavity, both of which will lead to low thresholds. As we show in this work, the dielectric <b>nanolaser</b> exhibits certain advantages relative to nanowire lasers and spasers, such as reduced laser threshold, short switch-on times, size and design flexibility. The dielectric <b>nanolaser</b> is compatible with standard lithographic fabrication approaches and its relative simple design may allow for easy testing and realization of the concept.

The coherence characterization of this type of lasers is inherently difficult with the conventional measurement of output light intensity versus input pump intensity due to the diminishing kink in the measurement curve. We demonstrate the transition from chaotic to coherent emission of a high-β pulse-pump metallo-dielectric <b>nanolaser</b> can be determined by examining the width of a second order intensity correlation peak, which shrinks below and broadens above threshold.

40|$|Abstract—The {{question}} of “what is a laser ” {{is closely related}} to that of what is laser threshold. We analyze possible definitions of laser threshold through the L–I curve and conclude that there is no consistent definition of a threshold when the spontaneous emission factor is large, {{as in the case of}} micro- and nano-lasers. All these definitions based on L–I curve are not consistent with the evolution of statistical properties of light output with pumping. Thus, we argue that the threshold definition based on L–I curve has to be abandoned for <b>nanolasers,</b> where the fraction of spontaneous emission into a lasing mode becomes quite large.

A finding fact that photon localization in small space modifies the radiation process {{was reported in}} 1944 by Purcell, and advances in fabrication technology enable such structures to be constructed at optical frequencies. Many demands of building compact photonic systems and quantum information systems have enhanced activities in this field. The photonic crystal cavity has potential in providing a cavity that supports only the fundamental mode of (lambda/ 2 n) ^ 3 together with good confinement of light within a resonator.

(1) A combination of quantum dots and photonic crystal nanocavities provides chirpless high-speed <b>nanolasers.</b> Room temperature low-threshold lasing action was demonstrated from a coupled cavity design (0. 7 - 1. 2 (lambda/n) ^ 3) embedding InAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots. The <b>nanolasers</b> showed small (absorbed) pumping power threshold as sub- 20 microW and high spontaneous coupling factors of 0. 1. Single quantum dot lasing is likely to occur both by proper alignment of the single quantum dot relative to geometries of photonic crystals and by a narrow QD emission line in the high-Q localized mode.

Built-in quantum well saturable absorbers enable us to probe the relaxation oscillation of such small lasers.
