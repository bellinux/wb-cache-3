25|$|A single Jianghu I (hull 516) was {{modified}} very recently. It has its anti-ship missiles replaced with several multiple-rocket launchers. The rockets are of 122mm caliber, and {{are based on}} the Type 89 system, which is itself quite similar to the Soviet BM-21 rocket system. The 122mm rockets are launched from a stabilized launcher, meaning that even if the ship is affected by wave motion, the launcher itself will be stabilized. The rockets have a range of up to 40km, and can achieve reasonable accuracy in fire. This installation may be seen as an experiment by the PLAN to make use of older warship designs, by turning them into shore bombardment platforms. Though only one ship is being tested for <b>now,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a very possible concept for future PLAN conversions of their large number of old Luda's and Jianghu's. Fire support from ships is seen as very important by the PLAN when conducting amphibious operations.|$|E
25|$|The Lophotrochozoa, evolved within Protostomia, {{include two}} of the most {{successful}} animal phyla, the Mollusca and Annelida. The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes animals such as snails, clams, and squids, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as earthworms and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of trochophore larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented. <b>Now,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla. Lophotrochozoa also includes the Nemertea or ribbon worms, the Sipuncula, and several phyla that have a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth, called a lophophore. These were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates. but it now appears that the lophophorate group may be paraphyletic, with some closer to the nemerteans and some to the molluscs and annelids. They include the Brachiopoda or lamp shells, which are prominent in the fossil record, the Entoprocta, the Phoronida, and possibly the Bryozoa or moss animals.|$|E

500|$|The Daily Mirror Beth Neil branded {{the plot}} strand [...] "one of the darkest and most {{disturbing}} storylines EastEnders has ever attempted", with critic Jim Shelley deeming it a [...] "new low" [...] for EastEnders. Shelley wrote of Whitney's abuse: [...] "You've {{really got to}} hand it to EastEnders. Just when you thought the show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce a new way of making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. Thanks for that! I realise <b>now</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a grubby, greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school. And they say family entertainment's dead." [...] Shelley refuted the BBC's claims that the storyline had educational value as [...] "totally bogus", observing that [...] "At 7.30 or 8pm, the [...] "action" [...] has to be so coded as to be pointless". Deborah Orr, writing for The Independent, similarly disagreed with the BBC's statement that the storyline was part of EastEnders [...] "rich heritage of tackling difficult social issues", writing that: ...|$|E

[...] He concluded with [...] "TNA's Unbreakable PPV was an astounding buffet of action, {{catering to the}} variety of tastes among professional wrestling fans." [...] Lacroix also commented [...] "If you missed it, get the replay. Don't think, just do it [...] the main event is well worth the price." [...] The main event was given Lacroix's highest match rating of 10 out of 10 in his review. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to the opening Six Man Tag Team match. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout was ranked with a 7.5 out of 10, while a 7 out of 10 {{was given to the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship contest. Commenting on the main event, Lacroix spoke of it as a [...] "certified match of the year candidate." [...] Going onto describe in detail: [...] "Unbreakable came to a close with mind-boggling main event, featuring a three-way dance between Samoa Joe against AJ Styles against X Division champion Christopher Daniels for the championship title. <b>Now,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the part where I go into a detail review of the match, but I'm not going to that. Fact is there is no review that could do justice in describing just how stellar this bout was." [...] Regarding the Four Way Elimination match, Lacroix believed Johnny Candido's participation was [...] "a nice gesture", but wonder [...] "if they could have come up with something else, preferably outside of the match." ...|$|E
500|$|After touring {{in support}} of One by One, Dave Grohl was {{uncertain}} {{on what to do}} next with the Foo Fighters. He felt that rushing to do another record would not be creatively rewarding. Grohl considered a possible film score, and began writing acoustic songs, eventually amassing a full album's worth of songs. Grohl, not wanting to make a solo album and accepting the drift from his usual style, brought the songs to the Foo Fighters – [...] "who's to say what we should sound like?". Bassist Nate Mendel replied that the songs' uncharacteristic sound was [...] "why [...] should go on the record." [...] Grohl decided against an acoustic record, saying [...] "I have to have loud rock music in my life somewhere", and decided to make a double album, with [...] "one CD that's all the really heavy rock shit" [...] and another [...] "that's really beautiful, acoustic-based, lower dynamic stuff", which Grohl described as [...] "the bottle and the hangover", and also with the rock record being [...] "my Jack and Coke record" [...] with songs that [...] "I realise I cannot live without that", and the acoustic being [...] "my Sapphire-and-Martini-with-Kylie record". Grohl also stated a decisive moment in making a double album was uploading demos to his computer and realizing he had five hours of music, adding that [...] "we've been a band for 10 years <b>now,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> our fifth record, and I thought it would be boring to just keep making album after album and making videos and playing festivals, so I wanted to do something special." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{he was not}} a power pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher. His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest in MLB history, {{and highest}} ever among relievers. Sports {{journalist}} Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was [...] "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather than heat." [...] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera. [...] "It's a tough situation throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said. [...] "There's not many guys who have a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen Scott Rolen said. [...] "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually a word you use with a changeup." [...] Robb Nen, a retired closer, was amazed at how Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. [...] "I don't think I could do it, to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said. Another retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style. [...] "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 [...] have an ego about being able to do that. [...] just went right into, 'Hey, you know, I throw 87 <b>now.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> what I've got.' And he goes out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did." ...|$|E
500|$|... 808s & Heartbreak {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 36 reviews. Chris Richards from The Washington Post called it [...] "an information-age masterpiece", while USA Today critic Steve Jones said [...] "West deftly uses the 808 drum machine and Auto-Tune vocal effect to channel his feelings of hurt, anger and doubt through his well-crafted lyrics". Dan Cairns from The Times stated, [...] "This so should not work...Yet 808s & Heartbreak is a triumph, recklessly departing from the commercially copper-bottomed script and venturing far beyond West’s comfort zone." [...] Rolling Stones Jody Rosen commended West's {{incorporation of the}} Roland TR-808 drum machine and described the album as [...] "Kanye's would-be Here, My Dear or Blood on the Tracks, a mournful song-suite that swings violently between self-pity and self-loathing". In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot called it West's [...] "most radical yet" [...] and said while West's fans may be disappointed, [...] "this one is for him. It {{remains to be seen}} if he goes back to making records for everybody else. For <b>now,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> one fascinatingly perverse detour." [...] PopMatters critic Dave Heaton was impressed by West's [...] "song and album construction, and with the way he captures a particular feeling through unusual, evocative, carefully crafted music that’s both simple and complex, cold and warm, mechanical and human, melodic and harsh". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau found it [...] "brilliant" [...] with a unique [...] "dark sound" [...] and [...] "engaging tunes", despite a second-half drop-off, and praised West's use of Auto-Tune, which he felt [...] "both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame that might otherwise be pure pity parties".|$|E
