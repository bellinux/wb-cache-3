5|$|In {{the regions}} (e.g. various regions within North America) where low {{selenium}} soil levels lead to low {{concentrations in the}} plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection.

Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because cyanide is released from the aglycone by glucosidase activity in the rumen and glutathione peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety. <b>Neonate</b> ruminants at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.|$|E

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Exchange {{transfusion}} is {{replacement of}} blood or {{main part of}} RBC mass and plasma of a recipient by compatible RBC or plasma from one or more donors. This study was carried out {{with the aim of}} evaluation the rate of complications of exchange transfusion in hospitalized <b>neonates</b> during 2002 - 2005. Materials & Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was done on 120 <b>neonates</b> with jaundice who had blood exchange. Medical documents of these <b>neonates</b> were then evaluated for complications of exchange transfusion. Complications after exchange transfusion were included hypocalcaemia, hyperkalemia, thrombocytopenia, necrotizing enterocolitis, cardiac arrest, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, seizure, sepsis and mortality. Data extracted were statistically analyzed by SPSS 10. Results: In 120 evaluated <b>neonates,</b> 64 <b>neonates</b> (53. 3 %) were boys and 56 cases (46. 7 %) were girls. The incidence of complications of exchange transfusion was 61. 7 % (74 cases). The most common complication in these <b>neonates</b> was thrombocytopenia (51. 7 %). The second common complication was hypocalcaemia (30. 8 %). Cases of necrotizing enterocolitis were not seen. Mortality rate from exchange transfusion in <b>neonates</b> was 5 % (6 cases). The rate of exchange transfusion complications in low birth weight <b>neonates</b> (body weight less than 2500 gr) was more than normal weight <b>neonates</b> (p< 0. 05). The rate of exchange transfusion complications in preterm <b>neonates</b> was also more than term <b>neonates</b> (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: This study showed the thrombocytopenia is the most common complication of exchange transfusion.

40|$|PurposeTo {{describe}} the clinical characteristics of full-term <b>neonates</b> with hypocalcemia {{and to suggest}} factors associated with neonatal hypocalcemiaMethodsThe medical records of full-term <b>neonates</b> with hypocalcemia were reviewed. Hypocalcemia {{was defined as a}}n ionized calcium (iCa) concentration of < 4 mg/dL. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) insufficiency was defined as a serum PTH level of < 60 pg/mL or a serum phosphorus level higher than the serum calcium level in the presence of hypocalcemia. ResultsFifty-three <b>neonates</b> were enrolled. The median age at diagnosis of hypocalcemia was 3 days. In all the <b>neonates,</b> formula feeding predominance was observed. Thirty-eight <b>neonates</b> (69. 8 %) were compatible with PTH insufficiency. The number of formula-fed <b>neonates</b> was significantly higher than that of breast-fed patients among <b>neonates</b> with PTH insufficiency (P= 0. 017). Intact PTH was negatively correlated with serum phosphorus levels. Twelve out of 14 <b>neonates</b> (85. 7 %) had 25 -hydroxy vitamin D (25 OHD) levels < 20 ng/mL and 9 <b>neonates</b> (64. 3 %) had 25 OHD levels < 10 ng/mL. Twenty-one <b>neonates</b> had hypocalcemic tetany. The serum calcium and iCa concentrations of <b>neonates</b> with tetany were 4. 2 - 8. 3 mg/dL and 1. 85 - 3. 88 mg/dL, respectively. Three <b>neonates</b> showed symptomatic hypocalcemia with calcium levels over 7. 5 mg/dL. Among the 16 <b>neonates</b> who underwent electroencephalography (EEG), 12 had abnormalities, which normalized after 1 - 2 months. ConclusionFormula milk feeding, PTH insufficiency and low serum vitamin D concentration are associated with the development of neonatal hypocalcemia. Symptoms such as tetany and QT interval prolongation can develop in relatively mild hypocalcemia. Moreover, transient neonatal hypocalcemia can cause transient EEG abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|Object: Perinatal {{asphyxia}} is {{the most}} common cause of elevated lactate concentrations in the neonatal period. However, inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) should be included in the differential diagnosis as well. The first aim of this study was to determine the natural course of serum lactate concentrations in <b>neonates</b> with perinatal asphyxia. The second aim was to compare these courses to those of <b>neonates</b> with an IEM. Design: We performed a retrospective patient study on 52 <b>neonates</b> with perinatal asphyxia from May 2009 to August 2011. They were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the University Medical Center Groningen. Five <b>neonates</b> with the suspicion of an IEM over the last 10 years were included. Three groups were studied: 33 asphyxiated <b>neonates</b> treated with hypothermia (HT group), 19 asphyxiated <b>neonates</b> not treated with hypothermia (non-HT group) and the 5 <b>neonates</b> with the suspicion of an IEM. Serial lactate concentrations were used to study the natural course of the lactate concentration. Lactate concentrations above 3. 0 mmol/l were considered elevated. Results: <b>Neonates</b> with a higher Thompson score and a lower cord blood pH had higher initial lactate concentrations. Furthermore, <b>neonates</b> of the HT group had a slower decrease in lactate concentrations compared with <b>neonates</b> of the non-HT group. Normalized median lactate concentrations were observed after 12 - 24 and 36 - 48 hours in the non-HT- and HT group. <b>Neonates</b> with perinatal asphyxia and the suspicion of an IEM had the same course of lactate concentrations as <b>neonates</b> with just perinatal asphyxia. In contrast, two patients with an IEM had persistently elevated lactate concentrations. Conclusion: Initial lactate concentrations were higher in <b>neonates</b> with more severe perinatal asphyxia. However, median lactate concentrations had normalized at 48 hours postpartum, independent of the severity of the asphyxia. In this study, it was not possible to distinguish <b>neonates</b> with perinatal asphyxia and the suspicion of an IEM from <b>neonates</b> with just perinatal asphyxia during the first 48 hours postpartum. However, persistent hyperlactatemie after 48 hours postpartum was suggestive for IEMs. ...|$|R

Methods: The records of all febrile term <b>neonates,</b> {{seen in the}} emergency room and admitted in neonatal ward of 17 Shahrivar children's hospital of Rasht, Iran from January 2004 to January 2009 were reviewed. All of them underwent full sepsis workup. The prevalence of SBI in total population and LRC positive and negative <b>neonates</b> were calculated"nFindings: A total of 202 records of previously healthy febrile <b>neonates</b> were evaluated. SBI was shown in 38 (18. 8 %). The most common type of SBI was urinary tract infection (UTI). Sixty-two (31 %) <b>neonates</b> had LRC, and only one (1. 6 %) had SBI (UTI with E. coli). SBI was significantly more common in <b>neonates</b> without LRC (26. 6 % versus 1. 6 %, P< 0. 001). The negative predictive value (NPV) of LRC to exclude SBI was 98. 4 % (95 %confidence interval: 96. 7 % to 100 %). Conclosion: These findings suggest that LRC may be relied upon to exclude SBI in febrile <b>neonates.</b> We propose that all febrile <b>neonates</b> be admitted, ill or LRC negative <b>neonates</b> should undergo a full sepsis work up and be administered systemic antibiotics immediately. LRC positive <b>neonates</b> should be under close observation...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a gas-chromatography mass {{spectrometry}} (GC-MS) metabolomics study {{was applied to}} examine urine metabolite profiles of different classes of <b>neonates</b> under different nutrition regimens. The study population included 35 <b>neonates,</b> exclusively either breastfed or formula milk fed, in a seven-day timeframe. Urine samples were collected from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), large for gestational age (LGA), and appropriate gestational age (AGA) <b>neonates.</b> At birth, IUGR and LGA <b>neonates</b> showed similarities in their urine metabolite profiles that differed from AGA. When <b>neonates</b> started milk feeding, their metabolite excretion profile was strongly characterized by the different diet regimens. After three days of formula milk nutrition, urine had higher levels of glucose, galactose, glycine and myo-inositol, while up-regulated aconitic acid, aminomalonic acid and adipic acid were found in breast milk fed <b>neonates.</b> At seven days, <b>neonates</b> fed with formula milk shared higher levels of pseudouridine with IUGR and LGA at birth. Breastfed <b>neonates</b> shared up-regulated pyroglutamic acid, citric acid, and homoserine, with AGA at birth. The role of most important metabolites is herein discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} on 100 jaundiced <b>neonates</b> as cases and on 100 <b>neonates</b> without hyperbilirubinemia as controls to investigate the incidence of UTI in <b>neonates</b> with hyperbilirubinemia. Medical history, physical examinations and laboratory tests were done on all cases and data was analyzed by SPSS software. The urinary analysis and culture (U/A, U/C) were performed on the urinary samples which were collected by bladder catheterization under sterile condition. Of the total of 100 jaundiced <b>neonates,</b> 11 cases had UTI, while there was no case of UTI in <b>neonates</b> without jaundice. This difference {{in the incidence of}} UTI between two groups was significance (p-value = 0. 001). Vesicourethral reflux was the most common finding anomaly in the <b>neonates</b> with UTI. Our results indicate that UTI is one of the important factors in neonatal jaundice. Therefore it is necessary to do U/A and U/C in all the <b>neonates</b> with hyperbilirubinemia. In addition, radiological studies such as sonography and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in all the <b>neonates</b> with UTI are necessary...|$|R
