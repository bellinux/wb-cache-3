50|$|Anderson {{was born}} in New York City, the son of Swedish immigrants. He studied physics and {{engineering}} at Caltech (B.S., 1927; Ph.D., 1930). Under the supervision of Robert A. Millikan, he began investigations into cosmic rays {{during the course of}} which he encountered unexpected particle tracks in his (modern versions now commonly referred to as an Anderson) cloud chamber photographs that he correctly interpreted as having been created by a particle with the same mass as the electron, but with opposite electrical charge. This discovery, announced in 1932 and later confirmed by others, validated Paul Dirac's theoretical prediction of the existence of the positron. Anderson first detected the particles in cosmic rays. He then produced more conclusive proof by shooting gamma rays produced by the <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> ThC (208Tl) into other materials, resulting in the creation of positron-electron pairs. For this work, Anderson shared the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics with Victor Hess.|$|E
40|$|Analyses of {{radionuclides}} {{are important}} in environmental monitoring and in research. However, as {{in the analysis of}} many other species, interferences may be a problem. In a-spectrometric detection, 238 Pu interferes with 241 Am, owing to their similar decay energies. In inductively plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), species with the same mass-to-charge ratios will not be resolved by a quadrupole mass filter. However, if interferences are removed prior to measurement, the detection will be specific. Measurement of pure. beta. [...] emitting radionuclides with radiometric detection will suffer to a high degree from specificity. However, in the analysis of 90 Sr, a measurement of the daughter nuclide, 90 Y, offers an opportunity. This radionuclide is a high-energy. beta. [...] emitter, and its short half-life provides an opportunity to verify the half-life. Short-lived radionuclides are often more readily (by means of the detection limit) measured using radiometric detection, because a very small mass is connected to a high activity. On the other hand, long-lived radionuclides are more readily detected using mass sensitive detection, e. g. ICP-MS, if no <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> of the element is present in the sample. The half-life at which the techniques will be most competitive with respect to the detection limit is of course floating, depending on the methods utilized. Analytical procedures for the assay of some radionuclides in bentonite clay were developed. The radionuclides included are: 90 Sr, 99 Tc, 236 U, 237 Np, 239 Pu, 241 Am and 244 Cm. Both radiometric and ICP-MS measurements were used, depending on the half-life of the radionuclides. These analytical procedures were applied to bentonite clay samples from a radionuclide diffusion and spent nuclear fuel leaching experiment. Results regarding the transport of strontium, technetium and some actinides in bentonite clay, as well as the release of these radionuclides from spent UO 2 fuel, are presented...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Manganese ore {{is widely}} used in much industries. Such as ore contain <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclides</b> at various {{concentrations}}. If this ore contain high concentrations of <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclides,</b> workers handling them might be exposed to significant levels of radiation. Therefore {{it is important to}} determine the <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclides</b> in this ore. Approach: The natural radionuclides (238 U, 232 Th and 40 K) contents of Manganese ore samples collected by Siani Manganese Company in Egypt-Cairo have been determined by low background spectroscopy using hyper-pure germanium (HPGe) detector. Results: The mean activities due to the three radionuclides (238 U, 232 Th and 40 K) were found to be 3543 ± 106, 222 ± 6. 6 and 3483 ± 104 Bqkg - 1, respectively.

With the increasing requirement for lead-free solders, {{the reliability of}} successor solders in microelectronics assemblies is in high demand. The elimination of radionuclides, heavy metals, and other poisonous elements in lead-free Sn– 6. 5 Zn solders in the microelectronics industry is a worldwide goal. As a result, {{it is useful to}} identify the <b>natural</b> concentrations of <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclides,</b> heavy metals and other poisonous trace elements (both macro- and micro-element contents), such as Au- 196, Th- 227, Ag- 110 M, Fe- 59, Zn- 65, Rb- 89, Rh- 106 M, Bi- 207, Cs- 137, Eu- 154, Sb- 126, Eu- 152, Co- 56, Co- 58, Co- 60 and K- 40.

Therefore, it is important to determine the levels of <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclides</b> in this solder to protect workers; these levels provide background for the safety rules and precautions that should be applied for those working in this field.

40|$|The {{determination}} of coral skeletal growth, from both a biological and a geological standpoint, has long presented difficulties in ease {{and accuracy of}} measurement. As a consequence, factors which limit growth {{are only beginning to}} be investigated. Radiometric methods using <b>natural</b> <b>radioactive</b> series <b>nuclides</b> have recently been used to determine the growth rate of certain corals.

It is thus possible to compare inter- and intraspecific coral growth rates from different areas with pertinent environmental variables and to educe possible correlations. We describe here an investigation of the effects of resuspension of bottom sediments on the growth rate, as determined by a 228 Ra technique and X radiography of Montastrea annularis in different parts of Discovery Bay, Jamaica. Such a study is unique both because the annual nature of growth bands is established for the most important reef-forming coral in the Caribbean and because radiometric and radiographic techniques are extended to measure growth rates as a function of environmental parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} predict the {{consequences}} of an accidental release of <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclides</b> relies mainly {{on the level of}} understanding of the mechanisms involved in <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclides</b> interactions with different components of agricultural and natural ecosystems and their formalisation into predictive models. Numerous studies and databases about contaminated agricultural and natural areas have been obtained but their use to enhance our prediction ability has been largely limited by their unresolved variability.

In this project, we investigate mainly the role of the biological elements (plants, mycorrhiza, microbes) in: <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> sorption/desorption in soils and <b>radioactive</b> <b>nuclide</b> uptake/re lease by plants.

The model is based on the extended Nernst–Plank equation, which handles the convective flux, diffusive flux, and electromigration flux under electroneutrality and zero electric current conditions. The distribution coefficient which arises due to ion interactions with the membrane material and the electric potential jump at the membrane interface are included as boundary conditions in solving the equation. A high Peclet approximation is adopted to simplify the calculation, but the effect of concentration polarization is included for a more accurate prediction of separation.
