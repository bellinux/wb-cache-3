5|$|Beauty in <b>nature</b> <b>has</b> {{historically}} been a prevalent theme {{in art and}} books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That <b>nature</b> <b>has</b> been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature as it is {{became one of the}} aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, {{the leopard}} shark is caught by {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries {{for food and}} the aquarium trade. This species is mostly fished in the waters off California where, {{after a period of}} population decline in the 1980s, new fishing regulations in the early 1990s reduced harvesting to sustainable levels. The International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> assessed this species as of Least Concern, while noting that local stocks may easily become overfished because of the shark's slow growth and limited migratory habits.|$|E

5|$|Active and schooling, {{the black}} dogfish is an {{opportunistic}} predator and scavenger that mainly consumes bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters {{of four to}} 40 pups that are sustained to term by a yolk sac. There is no well-defined breeding season, and mating and birthing take place year-round. The black dogfish contributes significantly to the bycatch of deep-sea commercial fisheries operating in the North Atlantic; it is of little commercial value and is usually discarded. As large portions of its range see little deepwater fishing activity and its northwestern Atlantic population seems to be stable, the International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> listed this species under Least Concern overall. It has been assessed as Near Threatened in the northeastern Atlantic, where its numbers may have declined from heavy fishing pressure.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{abundant}} sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds primarily on small bony fishes, but also takes cephalopods and crustaceans. In turn, it often falls prey to larger sharks and possibly marine mammals. In common {{with other members of}} its family, this species is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection. Females give birth to one to eight young either during a defined breeding season or throughout the year, depending on location. The reproductive cycle is usually annual, but may be biennial or triennial. Large numbers of milk sharks are caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries in many countries for meat, fins, and fishmeal. Despite this, the International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> assessed this species as being of Least Concern, because its wide distribution and relatively high productivity seemingly allow present levels of exploitation to be sustained.|$|E
5|$|Blacknose sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and in turn}} fall prey to larger sharks. Like other members of their family, they exhibit a viviparous mode of reproduction in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection. The females give birth to three to six young in late spring or early summer, either annually or biennually, after a gestation period of eight to 11 months. This species is not known to attack humans, though {{it has been documented}} performing a threat display towards divers. It is of moderate commercial and recreational importance. The International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> assessed this species as Near Threatened. In 2009, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the populations of the blacknose shark off the United States are being overfished, and proposed new conservation measures.|$|E
5|$|Feeding on fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, the Japanese {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that {{spends most}} of the day lying still on the sea floor. This species gives birth to live young, which are sustained during gestation by yolk. The litter size varies from two to 10. The Japanese angelshark is not dangerous to humans unless provoked. It is fished in large numbers and used for meat and shagreen, a type of leather. The International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> listed it under Vulnerable, citing the intense bottom trawling activity within its range and the low resilience of angel sharks to fishing pressure.|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, the winghead shark {{is caught}} {{throughout}} its range using gillnets, seines, stake nets, longlines, and hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh, the fins are exported to Asia for shark fin soup, the liver {{is a source}} of vitamin oil, and the offal is processed into fishmeal. This species is taken in large numbers in some areas, such as in the Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia, and anecdotal evidence indicates its population has suffered as a result. The International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting {{the shallow}} coastal {{waters of the}} central and western Indo-Pacific, the winghead shark feeds on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It gives birth to live young, with the {{developing}} embryos receiving nourishment through a placental connection. Females produce annual litters of 6 to 25 pups; depending on region, birthing may occur from February to June after a gestation period of 8–11 months. This harmless species is widely fished for meat, fins, liver oil, and fishmeal. The International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> assessed it as Endangered in 2016, as it {{is thought to have}} declined in some parts of its range due to overfishing.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that buries itself in sediment and waits for passing prey, mostly benthic bony fishes, but also skates and invertebrates. An aplacental viviparous species, females bear litters of seven to 25 pups every other year. The angelshark normally poses little danger to humans, though if provoked, it is quick to bite. Since the mid-20th century, intense commercial fishing across the angelshark's range has decimated its population via bycatch – it is now locally extinct or nearly so across most of its northern range, and the prospects of the remaining fragmented subpopulations are made more precarious by its slow rate of reproduction. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> assessed this species as Critically Endangered.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> {{listed the}} milk shark under Least Concern; despite being heavily fished, {{it has a}} wide {{distribution}} and remains fairly common. The reproductive characteristics of this species suggests {{it is capable of}} withstanding a somewhat high level of exploitation, though not as much as the grey sharpnose shark (R. oligolinx) or Australian sharpnose shark (R. taylori). In the 1980s and early 1990s, stock assessments of the milk shark off India's Verval coast concluded catches by gillnet and trawl fisheries were below the maximum sustainable level. However, these studies were based on methodologies that have subsequently been proven unreliable for shark populations. Moreover, fishing pressure in the region has increased substantially since the assessments were conducted.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the smalltail shark {{consists}} {{mainly of}} bony fishes such as croakers, while crustaceans, cephalopods, and smaller {{sharks and rays}} may also be consumed. It is viviparous, meaning the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection. Females bear litters of two to nine young on a biennial cycle, following an approximately 12-month gestation period. The smalltail shark is often caught as bycatch and {{may be used for}} meat, fins, liver oil, cartilage, and fishmeal. The impact of fishing on its population is largely unknown except off northern Brazil, where it seems to have declined significantly since the 1980s. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> listed it as Data Deficient overall and as Vulnerable in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Timid and skittish, the {{blacktip reef shark}} is {{difficult}} to approach and seldom poses a danger to humans unless roused by food. However, people wading through shallow water {{are at risk of}} having their legs mistakenly bitten. This shark is used for its meat, fins, and liver oil, but is not considered to be a commercially significant species. The International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> assessed the blacktip reef shark as Near Threatened. Although the species as a whole remains widespread and relatively common, overfishing of this slow-reproducing shark has led to its decline at a number of locales.|$|E

Population assessments suggest that this fishery does not currently pose a threat to U.S. populations of the species. The International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> therefore listed the finetooth shark under Least Concern, though no fishery data are available for this species off South America. This shark is not known to pose a danger to humans, though it snaps vigorously when captured and should be handled with caution.|$|E
5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse <b>nature</b> <b>has</b> yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E
5|$|The blacktip shark {{is popular}} with {{recreational}} anglers in Florida, the Caribbean, and South Africa. It {{is listed as}} a game fish by the International Game Fish Association. Once hooked, this species is a strong, steady fighter that sometimes {{jumps out of the}} water. Since 1995, the number of blacktip sharks taken by recreational anglers in the United States has approached or surpassed the number taken by commercial fishing. The International Union for Conservation of <b>Nature</b> <b>has</b> assessed the blacktip shark as Near Threatened, as its low reproductive rate renders it vulnerable to overfishing. The United States and Australia are the only two countries that manage fisheries catching blacktip sharks. In both cases, regulation occurs under umbrella management schemes for multiple shark species, such as that for the large coastal sharks category of the US National Marine Fisheries Service Atlantic shark Fisheries Management Plan. No conservation plans specifically for this species have been implemented.|$|E
