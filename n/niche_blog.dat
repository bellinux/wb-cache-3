50|$|Neither {{blogging}} nor niche {{marketing is}} a new concept. However, only {{in recent years has}} the concept of a <b>niche</b> <b>blog</b> come into being.|$|E
50|$|Usually, niche blogs {{will contain}} {{affiliate}} links or advertisements {{of some sort}} (pay-per-click or products or both). In some cases, {{the purpose of the}} <b>niche</b> <b>blog</b> is to incite the reader into visiting another website which may then attempt to sell the reader a product or service.|$|E
5000|$|Niche {{blogging}} (CanE, [...] or [...] ) [...] is the act {{of creating}} a blog {{with the intent of}} using it to market to a particular niche market. Niche blogs (also commonly referred to as [...] "niche websites") may appeal to [...] "geographic areas, a specialty industry, ethnic or age groups, or any other particular group of people." [...] While {{it could be argued that}} every blog is, in some form, a <b>niche</b> <b>blog,</b> the term as it applies to marketing refers to a particular kind of blog.|$|E
5000|$|The webmasters do <b>niche</b> <b>blogging</b> to earn huge money online from a {{particular}} niche. They do <b>niche</b> <b>blogging</b> on higher search volume keyword or any popular event {{so they can get}} higher traffic and ultimately they can get higher profit. Choosing the right niche is the crucial task in <b>niche</b> <b>blogging.</b>|$|R

50|$|As far as company-run {{websites}} go, <b>niche</b> <b>blogs</b> are {{an effective}} marketing tool {{due to their}} more organic, less sale-oriented nature. By providing useful content for users, like guides and user experiences, rather than just pitching sales, <b>niche</b> <b>blogs</b> encourage product and brand awareness, and are therefore popular {{in a range of}} industries as an addition to company websites.|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>niche</b> <b>blogging</b> among new marketers {{can be attributed}} to several factors, including cost, adaptability and generating traffic.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Niche</b> <b>blogging</b> and splogging {{are often}} hard to distinguish. However, niche blogging's {{reliance}} on pay-per-click advertising and other revenue streams usually requires such blogs to have valuable content {{related to their}} chosen niche, unlike a splog.|$|R
50|$|If built {{correctly}} <b>niche</b> <b>blogs</b> {{can provide}} their bloggers with a pleasant revenue. From just some extra income {{to help pay}} monthly bills to generous amounts that can replace their full-time job salary or overtake it entirely. The reason is {{that this kind of}} blogs target a specific type of audience that is closer to the final stage of the purchase funnel.|$|R

40|$|Extract] Within {{the past}} year, blogs have {{established}} themselves as an intrinsic form of online media on newspaper sites {{as the industry}} increasingly realises their commercial potential to attract new audiences, {{as well as their}} ability to entice readers to stay longer on newspaper sites. Offering instant interactive capabilities with audiences, blogs have developed a loyal community of readership who interact both with the newspaper and other readers. Blogs have also offered newspapers an opportunity to explore more personal topics in the form of <b>niche</b> <b>blogs,</b> which, for the traditional broadsheets, has meant publishing stories outside of the traditional subject matter resulting in a diversification of readership...|$|R
25|$|By genre: Some blogs {{focus on}} a {{particular}} subject, such as political blogs, journalism blogs, health blogs, travel blogs (also known as travelogs), gardening blogs, house blogs, book blogs, fashion blogs, beauty blogs, lifestyle blogs, party blogs, wedding blogs, photography blogs, project blogs, psychology blogs, sociology <b>blogs,</b> education <b>blogs,</b> <b>niche</b> <b>blogs,</b> classical music blogs, quizzing blogs, legal blogs (often {{referred to as a}} blawgs), or dreamlogs. How-to/Tutorial blogs are becoming increasing popular. Two common types of genre blogs are art blogs and music blogs. A blog featuring discussions especially about home and family is not uncommonly called a mom blog and one made popular is by Erica Diamond who created Womenonthefence.com which is syndicated to over two million readers monthly. While not a legitimate type of blog, one used {{for the sole purpose of}} spamming is known as a splog.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Current ranking algorithms, such as PageRank, Technorati authority, and BI-Impact, favor blogs {{that report}} on a {{diversity}} of topics since those attract a large audience and thus more visitors, links, and comments. On the other side, <b>niche</b> <b>blogs</b> with a very specific topic only attract a small audience and thus have only a small reach. This results in a low ranking from today’s blog retrieval systems. We argue that the consistency of a blog, i. e. how focused an author reports on a single topic, is a sign for expert knowledge. To find these blogs is particular important for other domain experts to identify blogs {{that they would like}} to follow and stay in active contact. To ease the retrieval of expert blogs, i. e. to separate them from the mass of blogs that report on random topics, we introduce a metric for blogs based on topic consistency. We divide the consistency ranking in four different aspects: (1) intra-post, (2) inter-post, (3) intra-blog, and (4) inter-blog consistency. By evaluating the metric with a test data set of 12, 000 crawled blogs, we demonstrate the plausibility of our approach. I...|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} {{aspects of}} the Google Blog Search service were met with praise: its ability to index new posts quickly, the option to sort results both [...] "by date" [...] and [...] "by relevance", and the [...] "Advanced search" [...] options which allows for more specific searches. The [...] "Frequently-Asked Questions list" [...] was seen as covering the basics quite well. On the other hand, the [...] "related blogs" [...] service was criticized due to it omitting {{some of the more}} prominent <b>niche</b> <b>blogs</b> from searches, including defunct blogs, and spam blogs. Filtering spam was cited as a challenge for the technology, as there have been cases of spam posts appearing in the blogs and posts that the technology located and identified. In a review by Duncan Riley of the Blog Herald, the service was critiqued based on different criteria: search (which was given a [...] "B"), numbers (which was given a [...] "C-"), and size (which was given a [...] "D"). Although the version tested was a beta test, the reviewer was disappointed as [...] "you’d expect something really good from Google". He compared the usefulness of the technology to [...] "Technorati", except [...] "with half as many results but without the error messages". In other reviews, the service's speed was commented on in a favourable light, one such review describing it as [...] "freaking fast".|$|R

50|$|Depending {{on which}} <b>niche</b> a health <b>blog</b> specializes in, {{it serves as}} a health {{education}} platform, promoting health literacy to its users.

People refer others to blogs they deem helpful in accord to the going concern.|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} role of {{academic}} blogs in supporting a group of preservice teachers while they became physically separated during the teaching practice. Underlying our study is an integrative approach that puts academic blogs alongside with other media {{in an attempt to}} discern their comparative strengths and limitations. In particular, academic blogs are compared with personal blogs in terms of individual expressions and reflection; and with discussion forums in terms of social interaction and reflective dialogue. The study took a qualitative case study approach and focused on a group of preservice teachers during their teaching practice. Academic blogging has been found to foster individual expressions, reflection, social networking, and peer support. It affords a more flexible and expressive way of individual-centered expressions. However, it is not very good at supporting dynamic and interactive online discussions. Our study helps deepen the insights into the educational affordances of blogs and marks an initial step towards discerning the <b>niche</b> of <b>blogs</b> as an educational media...|$|R

While points 1 and 2 represent influential individual blogs, point 3 {{is the perfect}} example of [...] "blogging island", where individual blogs are highly connected within a sub-community but lack many connections to the larger blogosphere. Point 4 describes a sociopolitical <b>blogging</b> <b>niche,</b> in which links demonstrate the constant dialogue between bloggers who write about the same subject of interest. Point 5 is an isolated sub-community of blogs dedicated {{to the world of}} pornography. Lastly, point 6 represents a collection of sports' lovers who largely segregate themselves but still manage to link back to the higher traffic blogs {{toward the center of the}} blogosphere.|$|R
40|$|MSNBC is pro-Obama, Fox News is anti. ABC is ‘neutral’, CNN is less so. Fox {{supports}} {{the war in}} Iraq, MSNBC opposes it. The Obama Administration prefers MSNBC to Fox, just as Bush prefers Fox to the New York Times. Indeed, the media are as politically biased as their editorial contents do not align with one’s politics. Hence, the liberals’ preference for PBS, CBS and New York Times in {{the coverage of the}} Obama presidential campaign than Fox News. Or, in my case, Malaysiakini, Malaysian Insider and Malaysia Today for critical coverage of Malaysian affairs than the mainstream papers, such as The Star or the New Straits Times Group. One’s preference for particular media outlets depends on how they reinforce our political views and affirm our beliefs. Thus, slanted reports are ‘facts’ and ‘substance’ to some, but ‘bull’ and ‘schlock’ to others. Where stories written by armchair journalists are generated from public relations materials and government releases, “bull” and “real news” are becoming more similar by the day. ‘Gonzo journalism’ might even become ‘respectable’ and a popular elective in journalism schools with students, the ‘digital natives’, carving their <b>niche</b> through their <b>blogs.</b> How far will students, consumed by a culture of Googles and Tweets, stretch and test the principles of ethical and truthful journalism...|$|R
40|$|The {{presentation}} of web content {{has become increasingly}} complex as the content is ac- cessed on several different devices. When presenting content on mobile phones there are several options to choose between, such as responsive web design, web applications, or native applications. Each option {{has advantages and disadvantages}} that should be considered to achieve a positive user experience. This thesis presents and discusses three possible interfaces for presenting niche news on mobile phone. The goal of the research was to understand which design elements and which functionality of niche news presentation is core to the user experience, as well as discern the technology on which to present these features. To this end, design science research was employed as the research method. A co-operation with Serienytt. no, a <b>niche</b> news <b>blog,</b> was arranged in order to gain access to existing content, and for readers to test and evaluate the prototypes. The prototypes were created in three iterations, of analysis, development and testing. A web survey was used to gain an initial understanding of the user group. Heuristic evaluation, with a total of seven experts, was used to improve upon the first and second iterations, while user testing was used for the summative evaluation. Five readers from Serienytt. no participated in the testing. An analysis of the collected data showed that all of the technologies tested can result in positive user experiences. Responsive Web Design is the cheapest to produce, while ap- plications cost more, but can give a more varied user experience. As for the design elements in niche news presentation, it was shown that simple and clear interaction is the most ap- preciated. Elements such as single columns, tabs, search bars and share-functionality are all valid and easily understood by users. In functionality, it was shown that the expec- tations of functionality is different between a website and an app. A mobile website is expected to convert most of a website's content, while an app is not necessarily expected to have the same functionality. These results are based upon data collected in this study, as well as previous research. The results presented in this thesis are based upon the analysis of the data collected in this study, as well as previous research. These results are compiled into a list of guidelines for niche news on mobile phones, which highlights the main considerations that should be made when adapting niche news content to mobile phones...|$|R
40|$|Communities in {{cyberspace}} {{have been present}} since {{the earliest days of}} home computers, when connecting to the web meant logging in to the WELL program. In 1994, when the Internet became more accessible to the public, and home computers were no longer considered a novelty, millions flocked to this new, virtual frontier that allowed them to connect with anyone around the globe. Folkloristics has been largely concerned with the tangible—what we can touch, hear, taste, and see. As the frontier of the web expanded, many folklorists contracted away from using it as a means to explore a new branch of folklore: virtual communities and all of the folkloric nuances that they possess. Fortunately, in recent years, folklorists have recognized the value and validity of the Internet folklore. This thesis is concerned with a very specific folk group, Mormon mommy bloggers, and how they function both in the blogosphere at large and the smaller <b>niche</b> of Mormon <b>blogs,</b> the bloggernacle. Mormon mommy blogs are distinctive in their vernacular, post material, and side bar badges. These blogs also provide a window not just into Mormon life, but also ideas about how faith can interact with identity and womanhood. Mormon mommy blogs are a vibrant genre of both Internet folklore and Mormon folklore. Mormon mommy blogs also serve as ways to undertake record-keeping for posterity and, for some, are a means of proselytizing, which are two important aspects of Mormon culture. Mormon mommy blogs also allow for frank conversations about expectations of the Mormon culture and the impossibilities of being the perfect Mormon woman. For non-Mormons, Mormon mommy blogs are a form of escapism into the lives of women who are confounding the notion that housewives and mothers are woefully unfulfilled. The fields of folkloristics, women and gender studies, and even religious studies could all benefit from examining mommy and Mormon mommy blogs. (102 pages...|$|R
