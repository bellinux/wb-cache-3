5|$|By {{the time}} Les Chants Magnétiques was {{released}} on 20 May 1981, Oxygène and Équinoxe had achieved global sales of about 6million units. In its first two months the new album sold a reported 200,000units in France alone. The album uses sounds from the Fairlight CMI, a <b>new</b> <b>instrument</b> of which Jarre was an early pioneer. Its digital technology allowed him to continue his earlier sonic experimentation in new ways.|$|E
5|$|Servicing Mission 3B {{flown by}} Columbia in March 2002 saw the {{installation}} of a <b>new</b> <b>instrument,</b> with the FOC (which, except for the Fine Guidance Sensors when used for astrometry, {{was the last of}} the original instruments) being replaced by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). This meant that COSTAR was no longer required, since all new instruments had built-in correction for the main mirror aberration. The mission also revived NICMOS by installing a closed-cycle cooler and replaced the solar arrays for the second time, providing 30 percent more power.|$|E
5|$|The group {{continued}} their Casbah residency {{into the new}} year, occasionally securing other gigs. In January, Brown grew ill {{and was unable to}} play the show. Best, however, insisted that the Quarrymen still pay Brown, but Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison refused; the incident resulted in the loss of their residency at the Casbah and Brown's departure from the group. Shortly after, however, Lennon convinced fellow art school student Stuart Sutcliffe to purchase a bass guitar and join the group. The group had no bookings, but began rehearsing vigorously to allow the musical novice Sutcliffe practice on his <b>new</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|E

30|$|Although {{these are}} the first PRO {{instruments}} developed based on perceptions of patients treated with non-insulin injectable medications for type 2 diabetes, there is overlap between these <b>new</b> <b>instruments</b> and instruments developed in samples of insulin-treated patients. Several constructs in the <b>new</b> <b>instruments</b> are also assessed by insulin-focused PRO measures (e.g., general ease-of-use, size of device, physical discomfort, confidence that the device delivers the correct dose) [7, 9, 10, 29, 33, 34]. Despite this overlap, the <b>new</b> <b>instruments</b> diverge from these previous insulin-focused instruments in important ways. A useful example is the 8 -item TRIM-D Device instrument, which focuses on experiences with insulin injection devices [34].|$|R
25|$|On October 3, 2008, Saint Thomas Church {{announced}} the Vestry's decision {{to replace the}} aging Arents Memorial Chancel Organ with a <b>new</b> <b>instrument.</b> As part of a substantial renovation effort to the church, a <b>new</b> <b>instrument</b> from Dobson Pipe Organ Builders of Lake City, Iowa, will be installed to replace the current instrument. Plans call for the retention of the especially ornate 1913 organ case-front and console cabinetry, {{and the elimination of}} visible pipework added above the choir stall canopies in the 1956 rebuild, to better respect the church's well-developed neo-Gothic design aesthetic.|$|E

25|$|In 2000 a few {{minor changes}} {{were made to the}} Clio range, which {{included}} revised specification levels, a <b>new</b> <b>instrument</b> cluster, and a passenger airbag fitted as standard for all models.

25|$|Payne, {{a fellow}} art student {{who worked as}} a Levi's shop assistant, had not played bass guitar {{previously}} and initially proved reluctant to take up the <b>new</b> <b>instrument.</b> After having completed a crash course of a couple of weeks, Payne played with the new line-up {{for the first time in}} a free space above the Horse Shoe Bar in Glasgow.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{starting}} in 1951, <b>new</b> <b>instruments</b> were ordered through {{the initiative of}} Eduardo Rohl. In 1960, a commission presided over by Duarte was charged with modernizing astronomical facilities in Venezuela using the <b>new</b> <b>instruments.</b> Some were installed at the Cagigal Observatory, but most were eventually erected at a dark site in the Venezuelan Andes.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} practice-based research in <b>new</b> musical <b>instrument</b> design. At a high level, the process involves drawing on relevant theories and aesthetic approaches to design <b>new</b> <b>instruments,</b> attempting to identify relevant applied design criteria, and then examining the experiences of performers who use the instruments with particular reference to these criteria. Outcomes of this process include <b>new</b> <b>instruments,</b> theories relating to musicianinstrument interaction {{and a set of}} design criteria informed by practice and research...|$|R

25|$|Church records {{suggest the}} newest {{contributing}} resource, the lecture hall, was added sometime prior to 1858. Unlike {{the church and}} parsonage, it uses the Greek Revival style, which had come to displace the Federal style. In 1885 the last major renovation to the church, the addition of an Odell tracker pipe organ, came. It was necessary to cover {{over one of the}} south windows to accommodate the <b>new</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|E
25|$|Though {{probably}} never a dominant instrument, the mandolin was learned by {{enough people to}} have a presence among the settlers who left Vietnam for the United States, and who continued to play mandolins in their new home. There are still people in Vietnam playing as well, although {{the cost of a}} <b>new</b> <b>instrument</b> is prohibitive. There is at least one mandolin orchestra still playing, a group of aging players teaching newcomers.|$|E
25|$|Suspension on the 1965 models was redesigned. Replacing {{the former}} leaf-spring rear {{suspension}} {{was a new}} three-link system, with coil springs. Interiors featured a <b>new</b> <b>instrument</b> panel and two-way key system were introduced. The introduction of two keys was for valet parking, in that the rounded head key would only open the trunk or locked glove compartment, while the squared head key would unlock the doors and the ignition.|$|E

The first phase has already resulted in 17-fold gains in performance. The second phase has started in 2008, it comprises the building of 5 <b>new</b> <b>instruments,</b> the upgrade of 4 others, and the installation of 3 new neutron guides.|$|R

Caprices continued with higher grade interiors than their Impala counterparts with luxurious cloth-and-vinyl upholstery, wood grain trim on dash, steering wheel and door panels plus carpeting on lower door panels on both sedans and coupes. A center front seat armrest was also featured on sedans.|$|E
25|$|It {{was within}} {{the power of the}} old Congress of the Confederation to {{expedite}} or block the ratification of the new Constitution.

25|$|The first {{documentary}} {{evidence of a}} pipe organ in the church is from 1847 when a <b>new</b> <b>instrument</b> a 2-manual with 14 stops, by George Sherborne, was installed on the west gallery.

A clarinet was added in the 1920s and in 1939 an electric blower was added. In the 1960s a major restoration was undertaken with further work on the organ in 1986, 1991 and 2000.|$|E
