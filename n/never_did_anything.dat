500|$|The {{details of}} Angelou's life {{described}} in her seven autobiographies and in numerous interviews, speeches, and articles {{tended to be}} inconsistent. [...] Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life, she did so eloquently but informally and [...] "with no time chart in front of her". [...] For example, she was married at least twice, but never clarified {{the number of times}} she had been married, [...] "for fear of sounding frivolous"; according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and Paul du Feu in 1974, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him. [...] Angelou held many jobs, including some in the sex trade, working as a prostitute and madame for lesbians, as she described in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name. [...] In a 1995 interview, Angelou said, [...] "I wrote about my experiences because I thought too many people tell young folks, 'I <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> wrong. Who, Moi? – never I. I have no skeletons in my closet. In fact, I have no closet.' They lie like that and then young people find themselves in situations and they think, 'Damn I must be a pretty bad guy. My mom or dad <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> wrong.' They can’t forgive themselves and go on with their lives".|$|E

Howard Weitzman, attorney for the MJ Estate, stated the whole lawsuit should be scrapped because, [...] "This {{is a person who}} made his claim five years after Michael Jackson has passed away, more than 20 years after the incidents supposedly happened, and who has given sworn testimony that Michael <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> inappropriate to him" [...] , and stated that this was just an attempt from Safechuck [...] "to recover money from Jackson's beneficiaries" [...] that should be rejected.|$|E

They never tried to get their sister in trouble or outsmart their mother {{and get away with}} it." [...] Instead, he and his brother create things for the sheer enjoyment of it or to help out others ("and for the ladies"); for example, Ferb and Phineas carve Candace's face into Mount Rushmore for her birthday, set up a roller derby for a rematch race with his Grandmother Betty Jo's old rival, create a haunted house for their friend Isabella to cure her hiccups and make a super-computer to find out what to do for their mom after being so kind to them.|$|E

Writer Michael Bacall developed these stories into an outline scenario in one night {{with the goal of}} creating the [...] "gnarliest high school party of all time". The remainder of the story was fleshed out in the following weeks. Bacall and Drake were told to [...] "go crazy" [...] with the script, although Bacall confessed [...] "I was a nerd in high school so I <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> like what's in the movie". Bacall worked on the script generally at nights between simultaneously working on the scripts for 21 Jump Street and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.|$|E
500|$|Now Christopher Smart {{was a very}} beggarly poet of {{the eighteenth}} century [...] but had not the {{smallest}} claim to rank with those great men beyond their common trade of poem. Kit Smart, in fact, though he wrote a pestilent deal of verse, could not write poetry—nor anything else [...] Legally mad, that is; for he appears to have been very mad in his senses, and a decent citizen out of them. He went mad—legally and medically—once, and nothing came out of it, perhaps because he was not mad enough. Then he went mad again and being duly shut up in Bedlam wrote one of the finest outbursts of lyric genius in the eighteenth century—perhaps the finest-before the advent of Blake [...] Smart regained his senses, and therewith his hopeless inability to write poetry. And he <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> after.|$|E

500|$|After {{her time}} with her new friends at the retreat, Sarah Savage was optimistic. [...] "I left the retreat with a {{different}} outlook on life, I could feel my confidence growing, slowly." [...] She appeared on chat shows ITV Breakfast and Live with Gabby in 2011, and returned to television in March 2013 as a guest on The Alan Titchmarsh Show. She took a job in Brighton, and has a blog that she started during the production of My Transsexual Summer. In the spring of 2013, she started HRT. 2013 was also the inaugural year of Trans* Pride Brighton, the first transgender pride festival in the UK, and she and Fox Fisher served on the organisation committee. In 2015 Sarah and Fox published a picture book, Are You a Boy or are You a Girl?, which Sarah wrote and Fox illustrated. [...] "Before I started transitioning, I never wrote, I <b>never...</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> creative," [...] said Sarah in a 2013 interview.

500|$|According to ESPN {{columnist}} Rob Neyer, [...] "with {{that single}} decision, Landis {{might have done}} more for the sport than anyone else, ever. Certainly, Landis <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> more important." [...] According to Carney, [...] "The public amputation of the eight Sox {{was seen as the}} only acceptable cure." [...] Over the years of Landis's commissionership, a number of the players applied for reinstatement to the game, notably Jackson and Weaver. Jackson, raised in rural South Carolina and with limited education, was said to have been drawn unwillingly into the conspiracy, while Weaver, though admitting his presence at the meetings, stated that he took no money. Both men stated that their play on the field, and their batting percentages during the series (.375 for Jackson, [...]324 for Weaver) indicated that they did not help to throw the series. None was ever reinstated, with Landis telling a group of Weaver supporters that his presence at the meetings with the gamblers was sufficient to bar him. Even today, long after the deaths of all three men, efforts are periodically made to reinstate Jackson (which would make him eligible for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame) and Weaver (deemed by some the least culpable of the eight). In the 1990s, a petition drive to reinstate Jackson drew 60,000signatures. [...] He has been treated sympathetically in movies such as Eight Men Out and Field of Dreams, and Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Bob Feller expressed their support for Jackson's induction into the Hall. Landis's expulsion of the eight men remains in force.|$|E
500|$|Maxwell {{bought the}} Mirror Group in 1986 and floated it in May 1991, {{appointing}} Clark {{to the board}} of directors. Maxwell claimed that the offer he made Clark would appeal to even a [...] "one-eyed Bulgarian peasant". Clark claimed that he tried to make Maxwell follow conventional business practices and remained convinced that [...] "until quite close to the end, he <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> I asked him not to do". It was only after Maxwell's unusual death on 5 November 1991 that financial mismanagement of the Mirror Group came to light. There was evidence of 29 unusual payments of £230 million from Mirror to other Maxwell companies within one year in a fraud that eventually cost the company, and its pension fund, £492 million. Clark claimed that there had been no evidence for the directors to act on against Maxwell, telling the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) that [...] "No system of internal control, however elaborate, can stop fraudulent collusion by a group of individuals holding authority and trust. None of us [...] would have taken on the job had we thought Maxwell was a crook. How many can stand up and say: 'We said he was a crook a year ago'?" [...] Clark's position was disputed by the Department of Trade and Industry, which determined that the two non-executive directors, Clark and Alan Clements, should have questioned the payments. At the EGM Clark almost lost his usual polite nature when he was accused of being a Maxwell [...] "crony" [...] by Rupert Allason and had to rule a no-confidence vote as out of order.|$|E

2500|$|A recent {{biography}} of Newman notes that {{since his death}} in 1890 he has suffered almost as much misrepresentation as he did during his lifetime. In the Apologia he had exorcised the phantom which, as he said, [...] "gibbers instead of me" [...] – the phantom of the secret Romanist, corrupting the youth of Oxford, devious and dissimulating. But he raised another phantom – that of the oversensitive, self-absorbed recluse who <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> but think and write.

2500|$|Another famous Princeton alum {{who played}} for Cappon is Sports Illustrated writer Frank Deford. [...] Deford played on Princeton's {{practice}} squad while covering the varsity team for the campus newspaper. [...] Cappon once set Deford straight about his talents, telling him, [...] "Deford, you write basketball better than you play it." [...] Deford later wrote the following about Cappon:"In a profession in which men are renowned for their behavior during a basketball game, Cappy Cappon stood quite by himself among coaches. Until the game was over, the man <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> but frown. There were degrees of frowning, of course, but his gamut of expression seldom ventured too far {{from that of a}} basic frown. A mournful frown, a disinterested frown, and if it was possible -- and it was -- a frown of satisfaction[...] [...] [...] And when something happened that there wasn't a frown to express completely, Cappy would cup his hands or rise to his feet and bellow the words: `What'rya doin' out there?' When the game was over, the frown would stay quite in place if Princeton lost. But if they won, he would finally smile just a bit, a smile that looked both modest and embarrassed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alexander Cockburn {{moved to}} the US in 1972 and once there he set himself up as a journalist. He would become close friends with Noam Chomsky, Edward Said, Israel Shahak, Andrew Kopkind, and Saul Landau, among others. Cockburn wrote for many publications, {{including}} The New York Review of Books, Esquire, and Harper's. From 1973 to 1983 he was a writer with The Village Voice, originating its longstanding [...] "Press Clips" [...] column, in his time there he interviewed Rupert Murdoch after a struggle over the ownership of The Voice culminated in Murdoch buying the paper. James Ridgeway later noted [...] "Murdoch, when he owned the Voice, was said to gag on some of Alex's pointed epithets, but he <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> about it. He actually had us both to lunch and offered us a column." [...] Cockburn went on to write Idle Passion: Chess and the Dance of Death (1975) as a class history of chess, {{and a lot of}} [...] "bogus Freudian stuff", as he would later put it, in a critical evaluation of the claims made for chess. In the late 1970s Cockburn and Ridgeway wrote Political Ecology in which they went through numerous areas of US domestic policy, whether it was housing or agriculture, critically examining each topic, making proposals to adjust policy.|$|E

[...] Immediately following DeVoe's phone call, Hoppus and Barker began laying down new ideas. Recording in Barker's basement and Hoppus' dining room, by necessity everything was electronic, with the two musicians experimenting with electronic drums, samples, keyboards and direct computer recordings. While away on a trip in April 2005, Hoppus participated in an interview with MTV News in which he revealed the band's existence, saying [...] "Right now, Travis and I are using the time off to start this project called Plus-44 [...] It's very exciting, like a breath of fresh air." [...] When the two regrouped, they decided to stop giving interviews about the new project. [...] "It was strange to be talking about music that we were just in the very first steps of writing," [...] recalled Hoppus. [...] "It didn’t feel right to talk about yet." [...] The band's name is a reference to the country code needed when placing a phone call to the United Kingdom, where Hoppus and Barker first discussed making music alone. [...] "When we first started talking about ever doing anything outside of blink was on the last European tour where Tom was telling us that he needed to take a year off from the band. [...] We <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> about it until Tom quit the band, but that's where it first started," [...] said Hoppus. The basement recordings were ambient and quiet by necessity.

2500|$|Overall, President Kibaki {{has been}} a weak leader who {{suppressed}} his conscience to survive dangers of one-party dictatorship. To get along Kibaki has never taken risks of leadership {{that are associated with}} leaders like Dedan Kimathi, Jomo Kenyatta, Mahatma Gandhi or Nelson Mandela who sacrificed greatly for the cause of freedom, justice and country. With a dwarfish conscience, Kibaki allowed the man in him to die and <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>anything</b> truly memorable ... when Kenyans wanted Kibaki to lead them against the tyranny of Kanu, he turned them down and stuck with dictatorship. Consequently, many Kenyans called him [...] "General Kiguoya" [...] or [...] "General Coward. ... Kibaki's politics was characterised by an attitude of taking extreme caution or [...] "sitting on the fence" [...] over risky questions. He only took sides when the safe side was clear. While some called this cowardice, Kibaki's admirers called it wisdom that won him the highest office in the land winning the favour of whole communities and elites. It {{remains to be seen whether}} this [...] "wisdom" [...] will win him lasting legacy as well. In judging his legacy, I will say Kibaki and his ilk committed grave errors that saddled Kenya with her terrible calamities of dictatorship or impunity, poverty and underdevelopment ... in judging Kibaki, posterity will not forget that, when Kenyans were risking jail, detention, exile and even death to end Kanu one party dictatorship, he called every second liberator [...] "mad man of the market that was trying to fell a fig tree with a razor blade. ... Kibaki has been praised as a brilliant economist. But his 'Kibakinomics' have kept Kenya poor and backward when other Third World countries were industrialising and joining the First World. 'Kibakinomics' has given leaders and elites freedom to grab and rob, enriched a few, impoverished millions and has afflicted thousands in his Central province backyard with jiggers. Same 'Kibakinomics' has allowed the country to lose Sh367 billion annually to corruption that has flourished under Kibaki's watch. 'Kibakinomics' even hired Mackinsey Ltd to dream Vision 2030 for Kenya! In the meantime, foreign companies have had a field day minting trillions in Kenya...unbeknown to most people, Kibaki entrenched ethnic rule and encouraged his ministers to turn their ministries into dens of ethnicity. Accordingly, the Kibaki government shared public funds and top jobs ethnically, to communities according to their political loyalty and numerical strength. Those who did not fit into clear ethnic definitions ... were simply left out of the cabinet and other political appointments.|$|E
