50|$|By 1899, England {{had been}} divided at {{district}} level into rural districts, urban districts, municipal boroughs, county boroughs and metropolitan boroughs. This system was abolished by the London Government Act 1963 and the Local Government Act 1972. <b>Non-metropolitan</b> <b>districts</b> {{were created by}} this act in 1974 when England outside of Greater London was divided into metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan counties. Metropolitan counties were sub-divided into metropolitan <b>districts</b> and the <b>non-metropolitan</b> counties were sub-divided into <b>non-metropolitan</b> <b>districts.</b> The metropolitan districts had more powers than their non-metropolitan counterparts. Initially, there were 296 <b>non-metropolitan</b> <b>districts</b> in the two-tier structure, but reforms in the 1990s and 2009 reduced their number to 201. A further 55 <b>non-metropolitan</b> <b>districts</b> are now unitary authorities, which combine the functions of county and borough/district councils.|$|R

5|$|Bath {{had long}} been an ancient borough, having that status since 878 when it became a royal borough (burh) of Alfred the Great, and was {{reformed}} into a municipal borough in 1835. It has formed {{part of the county}} of Somerset since 878, when ceded to Wessex, having previously been in Mercia (the River Avon had acted as the border between the two kingdoms since 628). However, Bath was made a county borough in 1889, independent of the newly created administrative county and Somerset County Council. Bath became part of Avon when the non-metropolitan county was created in 1974, resulting in its abolition as a county borough, and instead became a <b>non-metropolitan</b> <b>district</b> with borough status. With the abolition of Avon in 1996, the <b>non-metropolitan</b> <b>district</b> and borough were abolished too, and Bath has since been part of the unitary authority district of Bath and North East Somerset (B). Bath was returned to the ceremonial county of Somerset in 1996, though as B is a unitary authority, it {{is not part of the}} area covered by Somerset County Council.|$|E
