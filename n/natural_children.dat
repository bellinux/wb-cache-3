5|$|The {{situation}} was further aggravated {{by the absence}} of a clear successor, made more pressing because of Nerva's old age and sickness. He had no <b>natural</b> <b>children</b> of his own and only distant relatives, who were unsuited for political office. A successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the Empire and it appears that, by 97, Nerva was considering to adopt Marcus Cornelius Nigrinus Curiatius Maternus, the powerful governor of Syria. This was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander Marcus Ulpius Traianus, commonly known as Trajan, a general of the armies at the German frontier.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{the study}} of human {{communication}} is of great importance in linguistics and psychology. In order to achieve smooth and conflict-free interaction it is necessary not only to respect the rules of politeness, but also {{to take into account}} the position of the speaker and the addressee. This explains the need to study many psychological factors in communication. This paper studies the ego-state of <b>Natural</b> <b>Child</b> in speech communication. Investigating the behavior of communicants in the ego-state of <b>Natural</b> <b>Child,</b> we rely on the theory of transactional analysis (E. Bern 1961). According to this theory, the behavior of the speaker and the addressee in the ego-states of <b>Natural</b> <b>Child</b> varies from curious, inspiring, dreamy, and natural to the selfish, spiteful, shameless and impatient. The material for investigation is the dialogs from British and American fiction of XIX-XXI centuries. The dialogs contain the speaker and addressee’s replicas, meeting the essential requirements of the Principle of Politeness (G. Leech 1983) and the theory of transactional analysis. In our work we have applied hypothetical-deductive method, and methods of definitional and contextual analysis. The anylisis of our material demonstrates that communicants in the ego-state of <b>Natural</b> <b>Child</b> observe the maxims of generosity, tact and agreement, and violate the maxims of approbation, modesty and tact. Thus, the implementation of politeness maxims by communicants in ego-state of <b>Natural</b> <b>Child</b> depends entirely on their behavior...|$|R
25|$|The {{children}} {{were raised in}} Couëron, near Nantes, France, by Audubon and his French wife Anne Moynet Audubon, whom he had married years before his time in Saint-Domingue. In 1794 they formally adopted both his <b>natural</b> <b>children</b> to regularize their legal status in France. They renamed the boy Jean-Jacques Fougère Audubon and the girl Rose. When Audubon, at age 18, boarded ship in 1803 to immigrate to the United States, he {{changed his name to}} an anglicized form: John James Audubon.|$|E
25|$|Adoption {{was very}} common, {{especially}} when the father (or mother) was childless or had seen all his children grow up and marry away. The child was then adopted {{to care for the}} parents' old age. This was done by contract, which usually specified what the parent had to leave and what maintenance was expected. The <b>natural</b> <b>children,</b> if any, were usually consenting parties to an arrangement that cut off their expectations. In some cases they even acquired the estate for the adopted child who was to relieve them of care. If the adopted child failed to carry out the filial duty, the contract was annulled in the law courts. Slaves were often adopted, and if they proved unfilial, were reduced to slavery again.|$|E

Due to slave unrest in the Caribbean, in 1789 he sold part of his plantation in Saint-Domingue and purchased a 284-acre farm called Mill Grove, 20 miles from Philadelphia, to diversify his investments. Increasing tension in Saint-Domingue between the colonists and the African slaves, who greatly outnumbered them, convinced Jean Audubon to return to France, where he {{became a member of}} the Republican Guard.

40|$|Child before of {{marriage}} is basicly a term which definition is rather {{difficult to be}} correlated with the term <b>natural</b> <b>child</b> (ibn al mula'anah) as stipulated in fiqh.

In relation to inheritance issues, child before marriage or <b>natural</b> <b>child</b> inherits only from their mother and relatives, instead of their father.

25|$|So great an {{accession}} {{of strength}} to a neighbouring state, whose ambition {{she had just}} reason to fear, proved intolerable to Austria, which laid claim {{to a number of}} lordships — forming one-third of the whole Bavarian inheritance — as lapsed fiefs of the Bohemian, Austrian and imperial crowns. These were at once occupied by Austrian troops, with the secret consent of Charles Theodore himself, who was without legitimate heirs, and wished to obtain from the emperor the elevation of his <b>natural</b> <b>children</b> to the status of princes of the Empire. The protests of the next heir, Duke Charles II of Zweibrücken (Deux-Ponts), supported by the king of Prussia, led to the War of Bavarian Succession. By the peace of Teschen (13 May 1779) the Innviertel was ceded to Austria, and the succession secured to Charles of Zweibrücken.|$|E
25|$|The {{limitations}} {{based on}} consanguinity derive from {{a policy of}} practical eugenics and reflect the increased possibility that such marriages will produce children {{with a genetic defect}} due to the limitations on their combined gene pool. The limitations based on affinity, by contrast, are predominantly legal and social in origin. The rules relating to affinity reflect the need to minimise the prospects of familial jealousies and dysfunction by preventing the intermarriage of people already related by marriage. Difficult questions arise on whether an adopted child may marry his or her adoptive parents, or the <b>natural</b> <b>children</b> of the adoptive parents. No matter what legislative decisions are taken, there will always be citizens who wish to evade the application of the law. There will be no problem if they relocate and establish a matrimonial home in a state that allows their marriage. But any attempt to evade such laws by going through a ceremony in a state that permits the marriage and then returning to the original state (which will usually be their state of domicile, nationality or habitual residence) will fail, and may even expose the couple to the risk of prosecution for incest or an equivalent offense.|$|E
25|$|Veeckens {{wanted to}} sold the house off again. In 1819, {{the estate of}} de Klerk was bought by Leendert Miero. Miero, born in 1755 in Grodka near Lemberg (now Lviv), arrived in Batavia in 1775 {{to work for the}} Dutch East India Company. He is {{actually}} a Polish Jew whose real name is Jehoede Leip Jegiel Igel. He hid his true identity because the Dutch East India Company prohibited the Jews from travelling to its holdings, especially its new headquarters in Batavia. In 1777, Igel was received by de Klerk in the mansion and served as a low-ranked security guard for the mansion. A story goes that on a hot day Jehoeve fell asleep while guarding the entrance. When de Klerk unexpectedly returned, he was given 50 strokes for his laziness. On that same day, he swore that he would own the estate one day. After finishing his military service, Jehoeve changed his name to Leendert Miero and worked as a goldsmith. Despite being illiterate, he was able to make a fortune and bought the estate of Pondok Gede. Miero was able to reveal his identity when the VOC agreed to include Jews in its ranks in 1782. In the end, he bought the house of de Klerk. For the next 15 years, Miero invited big crowds to celebrate the anniversary of his lashing day, celebrated with a biblical humor. Miero married to two legal wives but he had no children. Instead, he adopted four <b>natural</b> <b>children</b> born to him by four different slaves.|$|E
