40|$|In {{the manual}} {{control of a}} dynamic system, the human {{controller}} (HC) is often required to follow a visible and predictable reference path. Using the predictable aspect of a reference signal, through applying feedforward control, the HC can significantly improve performance as compared to a purely feedback control strategy. A proper definition of a signal’s predictability, however, is never given in literature. This paper investigates the predictability of a sum-of-sinusoids target signal, {{as a function of}} the number of sinusoid components and the fact whether the sinusoid frequencies are harmonic, or not. A human-in-the-loop experiment was done, with target signals varying for these two signal characteristics. A combined feedback-feedforward HC model was identified and parameters were estimated. It was found that for all experimental conditions, subjects used a feedforward strategy. Results further showed thatsubjects were able to perform better for harmonic signals as compared to <b>non-harmonic</b> <b>signals,</b> for signals with roughly the same frequency content.

40|$|Abstract—Through of {{the concept}} of {{curvature}} energy encoded in <b>non-harmonic</b> <b>signals</b> due to the effect that characterizes the curvature as a deformation of field in the corresponding resonance space (and an obstruction to the displacement to the corresponding shape operator) is developed and designed a sensor of quantum gravity considering the quantized version of curvature as observable of gravitational field where the space is distorted by the strong interactions between particles, interpreting their observable in this case, as light fields deformations obtained on space-time background. To the application of this measurement we use a hypothetical particle graviton modeled as a magnetic dilaton which must be gauge graviton (gauge boson). Also are obtained several computational models of these photonic measurements, likewise their prototype photonic devices.

40|$|The {{acoustic}} signal {{from a distance}} sound source in an enclosed space often produces reverberant sound that varies depending on room impulse response. The estimation {{of the level of}} reverberation or the quality of the observed signal is important because it provides valuable information on the condition of system operating environment. It is also useful for designing a dereverberation system. This paper proposes a speech quality estimation method based on the harmonicity of received signal, a unique characteristic of voiced speech. At first, we show that the harmonic signal modeling to a reverberant signal is reasonable. Then, the ratio between the harmonically modeled signal and the estimated <b>non-harmonic</b> <b>signal</b> is used as a measure of standard room acoustical parameter, which is related to speech clarity. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully estimates speech quality when the reverberation time varies from 0. 2 s to 1. 0 s. Finally, we confirm the superiority of the proposed method in both background noise and reverberant environments...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{analysis of}} problems {{dealing with the}} determination of the current setting time in the inductive component of the complex load of Voltage-to-current (VTC) converter under non-harmonic input influence. There is showed the change in the transient response and in the current setting time of the inductor on changing the VTC converter and complex load parameters. Expression to determine the current setting time of complex load of VTC converter at given level of dynamic error is presented. The estimation of dynamic error in determining the current setting time is presented in accordance with the time dependencies of transient responses of current setting in inductive load of VTC converter with complex load’s and VTС’s converters different parameters. The mathematical model of precision VTC converter [1] with deflection system (DS) of cathode-ray tube (CRT) of television scanning optical microscope connected to its output has been designed and is presented as a complete equivalent circuit taking into account the resistance and parasitic capacitance of load. In accordance with the set conditions of raster formation on screen of such CRT, the control of converter is carried out by <b>non-harmonic</b> <b>signal</b> with variable shape, frequency, amplitude and displacement [2]. Precision VTC converter built as parallel circuit with a deep DS’s current feedback, the signal of which is formed on the feedback resistor, which is connected in series with the load, has been studied. To ensure the aperiodic current setting the bypass resistor is connected to the load in parallel. While analyzing this circuit we’re considering that: the static error due to instability of comparison resistors and feedback resistor is equal to zero, the cutoff frequency of VTC converter is higher than the resonant frequency of the load, and the error due to resistance of DS is compensated. The mathematical model allows to carry out a complete theoretical study of precision VTC converter and to get expressions to determine the parameters upon certain conditions: 1) supply voltage of VTC converter is higher than the maximum voltage on the DS during the transition process; 2) amplifier is presented as one inertial circuit with real parameters: unity gain frequency fВ, gain amplifier K 0; 3) the resistance of DS rL and parasitic capacitance CL are taken into account at analysis; 4) considered that the feedback resistor RЗЗ is non-inductive; 5) the current flowing through the resistor R 2 relative to current of feedback resistor is very small and it is neglected.

40|$|The Bayesian {{statistical}} inference theory is studied {{and applied to}} two problems in applied physics: spectral analysis and parameter estimation in time series data and hyperfine parameter extraction in Mossbauer spectroscopy. The applications to spectral analysis and parameter estimation for both single- and multiple-frequency signals are presented in detail. Specifically, the marginal posterior probabilities for the amplitudes and frequencies of the signals are obtained by using Gibbs sampling without performing the integration, no matter whether the variance of the noise is known or unknown. The best estimates of the parameters can be inferred from these probabilities together with the corresponding variances. When the variance of the noise is unknown, an estimate about the variance of the noise can also be made. Comparisons of our results have been made with results using the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) method as well as Bretthorst's method. The same numerical approach is applied to some complicated models and conditions, such as periodic but <b>non-harmonic</b> <b>signals,</b> signals with decay, and signals with chirp. Results demonstrate that even under these complicated conditions the Bayesian inference and Gibbs sampling can still give very accurate results {{with respect to the}} true result. Also through the use of the Bayesian inference methods it is possible to choose the most probable model based on known prior information of data, assuming a model space. The Bayesian inference theory is applied to hyperfine parameter extraction in Mossbauer spectroscopy for the first time. The method is a free-form model extraction approach and gives full error analysis of hyperfine parameter distributions. Two applications to quadrupole splitting distribution analysis in Fe- 57 Mossbauer spectroscopy are presented. One involves a single site of Fe 3 + and the other involves two sites for Fe 3 + and Fe 2 +. In each case the method gives a unique solution to the distributions with arbitrary shape and is not sensitive to the elemental doublet parameters. The Bayesian inference theory is also applied to the hyperfine field distribution extraction. Because of the complexity of the elemental lineshape, all the other extraction methods can only use the first order perturbation sextet as the lineshape function. We use Blaes' exact lineshape model to extract the hyperfine field distribution. This is possible because the Bayesian inference theory is a free-form model extraction method. By using Blaes' lineshape function, different cases of orientations between the electric field gradient principle axis directions and the magnetic hyperfine field can be studied without making any approximations. As an example the ground state hyperfine field distribution of Fe 65 Ni 35 Invar is extensively studied by using the method. Some very interesting features of the hyperfine field distribution are identified...|$|R
40|$|Accurately {{deciphering}} periodic {{variations in}} paleoclimate proxy signals {{is essential for}} cyclostratigraphy. Classical spectral analysis often relies on methods based on (fast) Fourier transformation. This technique has no unique solution separating variations in amplitude and frequency. This characteristic can {{make it difficult to}} correctly interpret a proxy's power spectrum or to accurately evaluate simultaneous changes in amplitude and frequency in evolutionary analyses. This drawback is circumvented by using a polynomial approach to estimate instantaneous amplitude and frequency in orbital components. This approach was proven useful to characterize audio signals (music and speech), which are non-stationary in nature. Paleoclimate proxy signals and audio signals share similar dynamics; the only difference is the frequency relationship between the different components. A harmonic-frequency relationship exists in audio signals, whereas this relation is <b>non-harmonic</b> in paleoclimate <b>signals.</b> However, this difference is irrelevant for the problem of separating simultaneous changes in amplitude and frequency. Using an approach with overlapping analysis frames, the model (Astronomical Component Estimation, version 1 : ACE v. 1) captures time variations of an orbital component by modulating a stationary sinusoid centered at its mean frequency, with a single polynomial. Hence, the parameters that determine the model are the mean frequency of the orbital component and the polynomial coefficients. The first parameter depends on geologic interpretations, whereas the latter are estimated by means of linear least-squares. As output, the model provides the orbital component waveform, either in the depth or time domain. Uncertainty analyses of the model estimates are performed using Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, it allows for a unique decomposition of the signal into its instantaneous amplitude and frequency. Frequency modulation patterns reconstruct changes in accumulation rate, whereas amplitude modulation identifies eccentricity-modulated precession. The functioning of the time-variant sinusoidal model is illustrated and validated using a synthetic insolation signal. The new modeling approach is tested on two case studies: (1)  a Pliocene–Pleistocene benthic δ 18 O record from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 846 and (2)  a Danian magnetic susceptibility record from the Contessa Highway section, Gubbio, Italy...|$|R
