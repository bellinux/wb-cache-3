We will base our approach to that Conference on the conclusions of the Summit and on the prices and incomes accord. In that context, I would point out again that all at the Summit agreed that if a centralised system of wage fixing is to work, there must be an abstention from sectional claims except in special and extraordinary circumstances. Let me say that my Government's interpretation of what constitutes such circumstances is the common -sense interpretation and leaves no room for selfish claims from maverick sections of the trade union movement. Participants at the Summit Conference recognised that if restraint in incomes is to be exercised, then it should be exercised universally. In that spirit of equitable sharing of the burdens of recovery the Summit also stressed the need for restraint in <b>non-wage</b> <b>incomes</b> such as dividends, professional fees and the like.|$|E

30|$|Why do {{remittances}} {{negatively affect}} individual labor supply decisions? Since remittances {{received from the}} migrant might {{have the same effect}} as that of the <b>non-wage</b> <b>income</b> in the individual (or family) utility maximization problem, there are two possible outcomes. Firstly, remittances could result in an interior solution in the labor supply problem, where the marginal rate of substitution between the consumption and leisure is equal to the real wage rate. Under this condition, if leisure is a normal good, then the increase in <b>non-wage</b> <b>income</b> reduces hours of work of migrant family members. Secondly, remittances might result in a corner solution to the labor supply problem when the marginal rate of substitution of consumption and leisure is greater than the wage rate. Since <b>non-wage</b> <b>income</b> raises individual budget constraints, it also increases individual reservation wages. Once individual reservation wages are increased to such level that they are higher than market wages, migrant family members would choose not to work (for detailed discussion of the effect of the <b>non-wage</b> <b>income</b> on the labor supply, see Killingsworth (1983)).|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a survey of}} the {{literature}} on theoretical models of the household, paying particular attention to some of the earlier contributions, and using them to place {{the current state of the}} theory in perspective. One of its aims is to suggest that the literature’s neglect of Samuelson’s proposal, that households can be modelled as if they maximised a form of social welfare function, was a mistake. However, the idea following directly from the Nash bargaining models, that the household’s preference ordering over the utility profiles of its members depends on exogenous variables, in particular wage rates and <b>non-wage</b> <b>incomes,</b> is an important one. Combined with Samuelson’s proposal, it can be made the basis for a general approach to modelling household decision taking, flexible enough to encompass non-cooperative behaviour and Pareto inefficiencies arising out of the inevitable incompleteness and unenforceability of domestic agreements.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} the static labor supply model using a large cross sectional data set encompassing {{the countries of}} Great Britain. I focus on estimating the labor force participation decision what is referred in the literature as labor supply on the extensive margin. The sensitivity along the extensive margin is expressed by calculating two specifications of a participation elasticity, defined as the percentage change {{in the labor force}} participation rate induced by a one percentage change in the gross wage or the net effective wage. The elasticities of labor supply are computed separately for men and women. The basic problem in estimating labor supply models with non-workers is unobservability of their wage rates that makes a non-random nature of the sample. I follow Heckman (1979) approach to correct for sample selection bias by estimating wage equation for workers and non-workers. Predicted wage rates along with <b>non-wage</b> <b>incomes</b> and a range of household characteristics are used in the probit regression model while the standard errors of the predicted wage rates were bootstrapped to correct for error-prone sampling distribution of predicted wage regressors that are non-linear functions of the estimated model parameters. I find that semi-elasticities of labor supply on the extensive margin with respect to gross wage are 0. 09 and - 0. 03 percentage points for men and women, respectively. Using the net effective wage rate these elasticities are 0. 10 and - 0. 01 for men and women, respectively. Both estimated elasticities are marginally larger in the net effective wage specification which I interpreted as a marginal incentive for men to join the labor market and less disincentive effect for women to withdraw from the labor market. ...|$|E
40|$|In this article, part of {{an ongoing}} discussion, Samuelson (2000) is taken as the {{occasion}} for a critical examination of Samuelson's work on the classical economists and Sraffa, a subject of continuing interest for that author, especially after Sraffa (1960). The article argues for the existence in Smith and Ricardo of an alternative approach to distribution and prices, and it aims at a critique of Samuelson's contention that 'Smith, Ricardo and J. S. Mill used essentially the same logical paradigm as did Walras and Arrow Debreu' (2000 : 140). In the first two sections, the attempt by Arrow (1991) to detect in Ricardo a theory of prices independent of demand—and founded instead on a real wage determined separately from, though not necessarily independently of, prices and the non-wage distributive variables—is considered with its implication of the wage entering the determination of the latter as an 'intermediate datum' of the theory. This then makes it possible to outline the characteristic analysis we find in Smith and Ricardo, where the wage as 'intermediate datum' entails a similar treatment of the output levels. The resulting theoretical structure is then used in order to answer, in sections III and IV, the two basic criticism, that Samuelson has advanced against Sraffa (1960). While the claimed dependence of the (1960) prices on an assumption of constant returns is voided by the mentioned treatment of outputs as intermediate data, the relevance of the Standard commodity, {{as well as that of}} Ricardo's 'invariable measure of value' is explained by the needs of determining <b>non-wage</b> <b>incomes</b> as a difference or 'residual', the essence of the theoretical structure under consideration. Section V then deals more directly with Samuelson's denial of the existence of a classical paradigm of economic theory. His arguments and interpretations are found to be in contrast with central features of Smith and Ricardo's work and, in particular, with their theory of wages. Thus, the admission of labour unemployment in 'normal' competitive positions compels Samuelson to a highly questionable interpretation of the chapter 'On Machinery' in Ricardo's Principles. In section VI, finally, the attribution to 'Sraffian literature' of a central concern for what Samuelson sees as 'steady states', but are in fact the traditional 'normal positions' of the economy leads the article to the deficiencies of neoclassical theory—an issue inevitably underlying the debate on the Classical paradigm. The dependence of the traditional versions of the theory, based on normal positions, on the notion of capital as a single magnitude—which forced the generalized abandonment of those versions in pure theory after the early stages of the capital controversies—is argued to emerge as equally present in the contemporary reformulations of the theory, thus affecting them, it is argued, no less than it did the abandoned earlier versions.

We can assume that, among people imprisoned for economic crime (60 % in Hungary, according to CSO 2008 : 52), a permanent shift away from delinquency strongly affects labor market behavior. In cases where crime generates income without consuming a significant amount of time, the effect of ‘reform’ is analogous to the impact of a reduction in <b>non-wage</b> <b>income.</b> If crime is time consuming and has diminishing returns, it can be thought of as a kind of ‘household production’, extended to the point where its marginal product equals the market wage. (See Grogger, 1998 for this line of reasoning, with reference to the seminal model of Gronau, 1977.) The implications of ‘reform’ are similar in a standard job-search framework: a fall in <b>non-wage</b> <b>income</b> is conducive to lower reservation wages and a higher probability of accepting a given wage offer. Discrimination furthermore reduces the job offer arrival rate, makes extended job search less attractive, and drags the mean of accepted wage offers downward.|$|R

40|$|The United States {{changed its}} tax {{treatment}} of married couples in 1948, from {{a system in}} which each spouse paid taxes on his or her own income to {{a system in which}} a married couple is taxed as a unit. The switch from separate to joint taxation changed incentives for labor supply and asset ownership. This paper investigates the effects of the conversion to joint taxation, taking advantage of a natural experiment created by cross-state variation in property laws. Married individuals in states with community property laws had always been taxed as if each spouse had earned half of the couple's income, and thus were unaffected by the 1948 legal change. Comparing the behavior of highly-educated taxpayers in affected and unaffected states indicates that the tax change is associated with a decline of approximately 2 percentage points in the employment rate of married women, consistent with the higher first-dollar tax rates they faced after 1948. Women married to self-employed men were also less likely to have <b>non-wage</b> <b>income</b> after 1948, reflecting pre- 1948 allocation of family assets to wives for tax purposes.
