A multiple-call hand-off problem exis ts as platforms <b>niove</b> across a cell boundary. Some recent works have studied the multiple-call hand-off prob-lem. In this paper, we ex tend the earlier work b y considering the sys tem providing two sep-arate queues for both new and hand-off calls. We analyze the sys tem by means of continuous-time Markov chain approach. The performance measures obtained include the b lo ckiiig prob a-bility of new call, and the terminating proba-bility of hand-off call...|$|E

Midtiple tokens also allow {{the viewer to}} iridiLqidriate iiiirl-tiple iristarices of a single tjpe of object. 111 the present stirdy, ire established a Jiiictioiial link for object tokens in hro seeiiiiiigly dis-parate visiral pherionieiia: apparent riiotiori arid repetition bliiidriess (RB). I n RB, repeated items are more dificiilt to perceive than inire-peated iteiiu. Using displajs iii which hro sets of alphariirriieric char-acters streamed in opposite directions across a coriiputer screen in apparent niotiori, we foirrid increased RB for targets appeariiig within a single apparent riiotiori streani, relative to targets in different ap-parent riiotioii stream. The results are inconsistent with refractory period or rlierriory retrieval accoiiiits of RB arid sirpport the role of object tokens in both apparent riiotioii arid RB. A person navigating through the visual environment not only needs to detect and identify the object? before him or her, but also to track these objects as they move about or as the person moves relative to them. People manage to do this {{despite the fact that}} the visual input is occasionally discontinuous because of blinks or eye movements. Several researchers have proposed that the coherent per-cept of objects intermittent over space and time may be mediated by abstract visual representations known variously as object files (Kah...|$|E
40|$|Hash-based randoniiiation is a {{powerful}} technique used in clusters and distributed system for load nlanagenient. I t offers uniform distribution, eficient addressing, little shared state, and scalability. Howevec siniple hash-based randomization is unable to deal with skew and heterogene-ity and, therefore, cannot achieve load balance in many environments. Virtual processors have been proposed {{as a solution to}} siniple randoniization 's problem. We evaluate an alternative load nianagenterit scheriie for heterogeneous, shred-disk clusters. Our scheriie directly runes hash-based ~mndontized load placement using a technique called adap-tive, non-iinifomi (ANU) randoniiaion (401 and compares favorably to the virtual processor approach. It provides tbe load balancing beneJts of virtual processors with less shared stare.
