25|$|The structure-activity {{relationship}} of morphine {{has been extensively}} studied. As {{a result of the}} extensive study and use of this molecule, more than 250 morphine derivatives (also counting codeine and related drugs) have been developed since {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. These drugs range from 25% the analgesic strength of codeine (or slightly more than 2% of the strength of morphine) to several thousand times the strength of morphine, to powerful opioid antagonists, including naloxone (Narcan), naltrexone (Trexan), diprenorphine (M5050, the reversing agent for the Immobilon dart) and <b>nalorphine</b> (Nalline). Some opioid agonist-antagonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists are also derived from morphine. The receptor-activation profile of the semi-synthetic morphine derivatives varies widely and some, like apomorphine are devoid of narcotic effects.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nalorphine</b> dinicotinate (trade name Nimelan), {{also known}} as N-allylnormorphine dinicotinate, dinicotinoylnalorphine, or niconalorphine, is a semisynthetic, mixed opioid agonist-antagonist which is {{described}} as a narcotic antagonist. It is the 3,6-dinicotinate ester of <b>nalorphine,</b> and is therefore the <b>nalorphine</b> analogue of nicomorphine (which is the 3,6-dinicotinate ester of morphine).|$|E
50|$|Diacetylnalorphine (BAN) is an opioid drug {{described}} as an analgesic and antidote which was never marketed. It is the 3,6-diacetyl ester of <b>nalorphine,</b> and therefore the heroin analogue of <b>nalorphine.</b> Diacetylnalorphine may behave as a prodrug to <b>nalorphine,</b> similarly to the cases of heroin (diacetylmorphine) to morphine and diacetyldihydromorphine to dihydromorphine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nalorphine</b> (INN) (brand names Lethidrone, Nalline), {{also known}} as N-allyl-normorphine, is a mixed opioid agonist-{{antagonist}} with opioid antagonist and analgesic properties. It was introduced in 1954 and {{was used as an}} antidote to reverse opioid overdose and in a challenge test to determine opioid dependence. It acts at two opioid receptors — the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) where it has antagonistic effects, and at the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) (Ki = 1.6 nM; EC50 = 483 nM; Emax = 95%) where it exerts high-efficacy partial agonist/near-full agonist characteristics. <b>Nalorphine</b> was the second opioid antagonist to be introduced, preceded by nalodeine (N-allylnorcodeine) in 1915 and followed by naloxone in 1960 and naltrexone in 1963. Due to potent activation of the KOR, <b>nalorphine</b> produces side effects such as dysphoria, anxiety, confusion, and hallucinations, and for this reason, is no longer used medically. [...] <b>Nalorphine</b> has a number of analogues including niconalorphine (the nicomorphine analogue) , diacetylnalorphine (heroin analogue) dihydronalorphine(dihydromorphine) and a number of others and a number of codeine-based ones as well.|$|E
50|$|Profadol (CI-572) is an opioid {{analgesic}} which {{was developed in}} the 1960s by Parke-Davis. It acts as a mixed agonist-antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor. The analgetic potency is about the same as of pethidine (meperidine), the antagonistic effect is 1/50 of <b>nalorphine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nalodeine, {{also known}} more {{commonly}} as N-allylnorcodeine, is an opioid antagonist (specifically, an antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor) {{that was never}} marketed but is of notability in having been the first opioid antagonist to have been discovered. It was first reported in 1915, and {{this was followed by}} the clinical introduction of <b>nalorphine</b> (N-allylnormorphine) in 1954, naloxone (N-allyloxymorphone) in 1960, and naltrexone (N-methylcyclopropyloxymorphone) in 1963. Nalmefene (6-desoxy-6-methylene-naltrexone), another structurally related opioid antagonist derivative, was also subsequently introduced, in 1996. In animals, nalodeine both reverses morphine- and heroin-induced respiratory depression and acts as a respiratory stimulant in its own right (i.e., when given alone). Similarly to <b>nalorphine,</b> nalodeine has also been found to act as an agonist of the κ-opioid receptor.|$|E
50|$|Etorphine is an {{extremely}} potent, non-selective full agonist of the μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors. It also has relatively weak affinity for the nociceptin receptor. Etorphine has an LD50 of 30μg in humans. Its mu affinity is 0.024nM compared with <b>nalorphine</b> nM 0.559Nm and diprenorphine 0.072kI so the compound naloxone would need large doses as it battles for space on receptors. Diprenorphine Carfentanil has a Ki of 0.0000007.|$|E
5000|$|Activation of the KOR {{appears to}} antagonize {{many of the}} effects of the MOR, {{including}} analgesia, tolerance, euphoria, and memory regulation. <b>Nalorphine</b> and nalmefene are dual MOR antagonists and KOR agonists that have been used clinically as antidotes for opioid overdose, although the specific role and significance of KOR activation in this indication, if any, is uncertain. In any case however, KOR agonists notably do not affect respiratory drive, and hence do not reverse MOR activation-induced respiratory depression.|$|E
50|$|Normorphine is an opiate analogue, the N-demethylated {{derivative}} of morphine, that was first {{described in the}} 1950s when {{a large group of}} N-substituted morphine analogues were characterized for activity. The compound has relatively little opioid activity in its own right, but is a useful intermediate which can be used to produce both opioid antagonists such as <b>nalorphine,</b> and also potent opioid agonists such as N-phenethylnormorphine. It is also a major metabolite of morphine, with its formation from morphine catalyzed by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C8.|$|E

The opioid antagonist activity of Nalbuphine is one-fourth as potent as <b>nalorphine</b> and 10 times that of pentazocine.|$|E
50|$|The weak partial agonist {{effect can}} be useful for some purposes, and has {{previously}} been used for purposes such as long-term maintenance of former opioid addicts using <b>nalorphine,</b> however it can also have disadvantages such as worsening respiratory depression in patients who have overdosed on non-opioid sedatives such as alcohol or barbiturates. Naloxone {{on the other hand}} has no partial antagonist effects, and is in fact a partial inverse antagonist at μ-opioid receptors, and so is the preferred antidote drug for treating opioid overdose.|$|E
50|$|Some opioid antagonists are not pure antagonists {{but in fact}} do {{produce some}} weak opioid partial agonist effects, and can produce {{analgesic}} effects when administered in high doses to opioid-naive individuals. Examples of such compounds include <b>nalorphine</b> and levallorphan. However, the analgesic effects from these specific drugs are limited and tend {{to be accompanied by}} dysphoria, most likely due to additional agonist action at the κ-opioid receptor. As they induce opioid withdrawal effects in people who are taking, or have recently used, opioid full antagonists, these drugs are considered to be antagonists for practical purposes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relative}} analgesic {{potency of}} 11 opioid agents (μ-opioid receptor agonists - fentanyl, levorphanol, methadone, morphine, meperidine and codeine; the partial μ agonist - buprenorphine; and the κ-opioid receptor agonists - <b>nalorphine,</b> bremazocine, U50488 and CI-977) in the Northern grass frog produced a dose-dependent and long-lasting analgesia which persists {{for at least}} 4 hours. The relative analgesic potency of μ-opioids in amphibians was correlated with the relative analgesic potency of these same agents recorded in on the mouse writhing and hot plate tests. [...] Other opioid analgesics are effective in amphibians, for example, butorphanol.|$|E
50|$|Buprenorphine and {{dezocine}} are partial agonists of the MOR but antagonists of the KOR. Contrarily, eptazocine is an antagonist of the MOR but an agonist of the KOR; {{the same}} is also true for <b>nalorphine</b> and levallorphan. A variety of partial agonists or mixed agonists-antagonists of the MOR and KOR are also marketed, and include butorphanol, levorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, and phenazocine. All of the aforementioned drugs may be described as opioid modulators instead of as pure antagonists. With the sole exception of <b>nalorphine,</b> all of the preceding are used as analgesics (by virtue {{of the fact that}} both MOR and KOR agonism independently confer pain relief). However, these opioid analgesics have atypical properties in comparison to the prototypical pure MOR full agonist opioid analgesics, such as less or no risk of respiratory depression for MOR partial agonists and antagonists, reduced or no euphoria, abuse potential, and dependence liability with MOR partial agonists/antagonists, and use- and dose-limiting side effects such as dysphoria and hallucinations with KOR agonists. In addition, by virtue of its KOR antagonism, buprenorphine (as buprenorphine/samidorphan (ALKS-5461) or buprenorphine/naltrexone to block its MOR agonism) is under investigation for the treatment of depression and cocaine dependence, as are other KOR antagonists such as CERC-501 (LY-2456302) and, previously, JDTic and PF-4455242 (both discontinued due to toxicity concerns).|$|E

Nonetheless, Berry is troubled by this conclusion and continues his investigation despite Wilson's displeasure. Eventually, he discovers that Karen's drug-dealing friends, Roman and Angela, performed the botched abortion, but Berry is attacked and sent to the hospital before he can reveal his discovery. Subsequently, Berry's attacker, who turns out to be Karen's African-American boyfriend, is also brought in an ambulance, dead after a fatal fall. The actual abortionist attempts to commit suicide. Berry forces her to confess in the hospital by threatening her with what she believes is an excruciatingly painful dose of <b>Nalorphine</b> (but is actually water).|$|E
50|$|Diprenorphine is {{the strongest}} opioid {{antagonist}} that is commercially available (some 100 times more potent as an antagonist than <b>nalorphine),</b> and is used for reversing the effects of very strong opioids for which the binding affinity is so high that naloxone does not effectively or reliably reverse the narcotic effects. These super-potent opioids, with the single exception of buprenorphine (which has an improved safety-profile due to its partial agonism character), are not used in humans because the dose for a human is so small {{that it would be}} difficult to measure properly, so there is an excessive risk of overdose leading to fatal respiratory depression. However conventional opioid derivatives are not strong enough to rapidly tranquilize large animals, like elephants and rhinos, so drugs such as etorphine and carfentanil are available for this purpose.|$|E

40|$|<b>Nalorphine</b> is {{an unusual}} opiate. Whereas low doses of nalor-phine antagonize {{morphine}} analgesia, higher <b>nalorphine</b> doses are analgesic, with ED values (95 % CL) of 13. 4 (11. 5, 15. 8) mg/kg in the writhing and 39. 5 (26. 6, 60. 1) mg/kg in the tail-flick assay. Although <b>nalorphine</b> analgesia is sensitive to naloxone, implying an oploid mechanism, neither 3 -funaltrexamine, naltnn-dole nor nor-binaltorphomine antagonized <b>nalorphine</b> analgesia in the tail-flick assay at doses which reversed equianalgesic doses of their respective selective agonists. <b>Nalorphine</b> and the kappa 3 opiate naloxone benzoylhydrazone demonstrated anal-gesic cross-tolerance {{regardless of whether the}} mice were treated chronically with either <b>nalorphine</b> or naloxone benzyol-hydrazone.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to compare the {{capacity}} of opioid antagonists to elicit withdrawal jumping in mice following two acute pretreatment doses of the opioid agonist morphine. Antagonists that precipitate vigorous withdrawal jumping across both morphine treatment doses are hypothesized to be strong inverse agonists at the μ-opioid receptor, whereas antagonists that elicit withdrawal jumping in mice treated with the high but not the low dose of morphine are hypothesized to be weak inverse agonists. Male, Swiss-Webster mice (15 – 30 [*]g) were acutely treated with 56 or 180 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 morphine 4 [*]h prior to injection with naloxone, naltrexone, diprenorphine, <b>nalorphine,</b> or naloxonazine. Vertical jumping, paw tremors, and weight loss were recorded.

All antagonists produced paw tremors and weight loss although these effects were generally not dose-dependent. Taken together, these findings reveal a rank order of negative intrinsic efficacy for these opioid antagonists as follows: naloxone=naltrexone⩾diprenorphine>nalorphine=naloxonazine. Furthermore, the observation that <b>nalorphine</b> and naloxonazine blocked the naloxone-induced withdrawal jumping provides additional evidence that <b>nalorphine</b> and naloxonazine are weaker inverse agonists than naloxone...|$|E
