40|$|There is {{a strong}} need of {{standardisation}} {{in the field of}} textile products and toys, in order to allow the enforceability of restrictions established in the EU legislation. The JRC has been actively involved in the progresses made on the development of standard methods for the characterisation of textile fibres and yarns and for the safety of textile products and toy, which are reviewed in this report. A number of standard methods published or under development are entirely or partly based on the JRC work. The work performed by Working Groups (WGs), of which the JRC is member, is described: CEN/TC 248 /WG 26 (on test methods for analysis of EC restricted substances in textiles); CEN/TC 248 /WG 30 (on quantitative analysis of fibre mixtures); CEN/TC/ 52 /WG 5 (on chemical properties of toys); and ISO/TC/WG 22 (on composition and chemical testing of textiles). The need for the test methods and their principles are explained, together with their stage in the approval process. The following standard methods have been published in 2013 : EN ISO 1833 - 22 	Textiles - Quantitative chemical analysis - Part 22 : Mixtures of viscose or certain types of cupro or modal or lyocell and flax fibres (method using formic acid and zinc chloride) EN ISO 1833 - 25 	Textiles - Quantitative chemical analysis - Part 25 : Mixtures of polyester and certain other fibres (method using trichloroacetic acid and chloroform) EN ISO 1833 - 26 	Textiles - Quantitative chemical analysis - Part 26 : Mixtures of melamine and cotton or aramide fibres (method using hot formic acid) EN 71 - 3 Safety of toys Part 3 : Migration of certain elements EN 71 - 12 Safety of toys Part 12 : N-nitrosamines and <b>N-nitrosatable</b> substances	 ISO 2076 Textiles - Man-made fibres - Generic names The following standard methods and technical reports are under development or in revision or in publication: PrEN ISO 16373 - 1, - 2 and - 3 Textile – Dyestuffs - Part 1 : General principles of testing coloured textiles for dyestuff; Part 2 : General method for the determination of extractable dyestuffs including allergenic and carcinogenic substances; Part 3 : Method for determination of carcinogenic extractable dyestuffs (method using triethylamine/methanol) PrEN 15777 : 2009 /prA 1 	Textiles - Test methods for phthalates Technical report - guidance on health and environmental issues related to the chemical content of textile products intended to clothing, interior textiles and upholstery prEN ISO 18254 - Textile – Detection and determination of APEO in textiles by HPLC-MS WI 00248537 and WI 00248536 Textile – Determination of metal content Part 1 : Determination of metals using microwave digestion; Part 2 : Determination of metals extracted by acidic artificial perspiration solution prEN 71 - 3 /pr A 1 Safety of toys Part 3 : Migration of certain elements WD 18074 Textiles - Identification of some animal fibres by DNA analysis method - Cashmere, wool, yak and their blends ISO/CD 17751 - 1 and - 2 Textiles - Quantitative analysis of cashmere, wool, other specialty animal fibers and their blends Part 1 : Light Microscopy method; Part 2 : Scanning Electron Microscopy method ISO FDIS 14389 	Textiles- Determination of the content of phthalates - tetrahydrofuran WD 17881 - 1, - 2 and - 3 	Textiles - Determination of certain flame retardants – Part 1 : Brominated flame retardants; Part 2 : Phosphorus flame retardants; Part 3 : Short chain paraffin flame retardantsJRC.
