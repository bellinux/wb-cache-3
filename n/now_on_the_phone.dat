50|$|According to this law, new {{facts and}} {{artifacts}} do not cancel out other facts {{that are already}} included in culture; facts and artifacts belonging to one time period form a stratum; new strata enhance and invigorate old ones. For example, preliterary societies use animals {{as a source of}} power (horses, oxen, donkeys, mules, etc.); ancient civilizations add mechanisms (windmills, water mills) and keep and improve, through selection and breeding, the breeds of animals used as source of power; modern civilization adds electricity and nuclear power and keeps animals as a source of power, enhancing that old stratum through attributing entertainment value to it (e.g. hay rides and sleigh rides at $3 per adult at a historic farm). For another example, every preliterary society has oral speech, news and folklore; when writing is invented, old genres become invigorated and grow {{with the help of the}} new technology: folklore can be recorded and stored, oral dialogue can involve exchange of notes, news can be recorded and spread confidentially, public speeches now may be written down before they are pronounced, and there is an expectation of greater uniformity in grammar even in traditional oral genres. With the invention of the printing press manuscripts receive standard orthography, footnotes, tables of content, i.e. printing adds onto the achievements of the written stage; and certainly with the introduction of electronic means oral genres are not cancelled out but are enhanced (we can <b>now</b> talk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> or even a videophone), written genres are enhanced (documents, letters and memos receive additional formatting and can be exchanged faster) and printed genres are enhanced (e.g. many texts can be accessed easier, searched for specific expressions and abundantly commented).|$|R

Yung L.A. ain't get the okay from none one of us and ain’t none one of us told you nothin' about you having nothing to do with Duct Tape, You dead wrong. He’s gonna have to get like a pendant or a star or somethin’ to cover that shit. It’s like an ex-boyfriend name or somethin', he finna get that shit covered-up." [...] On February 23, 2011, Austin admitted and confirmed it was the Duct Tape Entertainment Logo though he was not officially signed to the label; he stated [...] "That tattoo just comes from something in the city. My cousins grew {{up with a lot of}} people from Zone 6, I know a lot of people from Zone 6, and the people from Zone 6, there whole movement is called Duct Tape and I just had been really getting up with these guys. Everybody in the city from Zone 6, Zone 3, Zone 1, from Duct Tape to YGC to CDB to 30 Deep, there’s so many cliques in Atlanta and I just wanted to be the Robin Hood, I just wanted to be the guy that could have relationships with everybody in the city."

Off of that when we sat down and had the talking everybody was just choppin' it up and I was like this is what it is, this is the new beginning. I can’t really go on what Alley Boy say cause he's not the CEO of the label. So he wasn't around at the sit-down, when we did chop it up. I had my relationship with Big Bank Black, other cats, and people that I grew up with and they love me genuinely. That’s the relationship I had.” On March 2, 2011, Yung L.A. stated that he would not be removing the tattoo, stating [...] "Duck Still On My Face. It Aint Going No Where. I Got Goons Behind Me." [...] On March 9, 2011, Ausin revealed that he had cover up the tattoo stating [...] "We ain't trying to put no negative energy out. I just gave Tape Ent a big up, a shoutout.

[...] On April 14, 2011, Austin was later seen on a viral video being set up and viciously assaulted by Alley Boy and members of Duct Tape. On March 27, 2012, during an interview, Austin spoke about the incident, stating [...] "At the end of the day with that Alley Boy sh*t, that sh*t dead and gone. Because I mean everybody seen it on youtube im one man, you one man, if six n****'s jump you, shit the same outcome gone come out, you see what im saying, you'll seen it and the world seen it, ima one man army I don't got no problem with nobody.
