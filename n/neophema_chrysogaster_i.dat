5000|$|... #Caption: The {{orange-bellied parrot}} (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster)</b> is a {{critically}} endangered species.|$|R
50|$|The AMLR region {{comprises}} 249 {{species of}} birds, 69 {{of which are}} considered threatened. The three species that are considered Endangered are: the Chestnut-rumped heathwren (Hylacola pyrrhopygia parkeri), the Mt Lofty Ranges Southern emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus intermedius) and the Orange-bellied parrot (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The King Island Biodiversity Management Plan 2012-2022 {{identified}} Lake Flannigan as {{habitat for}} the Orange-bellied Parrot (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster),</b> which uses the area each {{year as a}} stop-over en route to Victoria, from mid-March to June and again briefly in September when returning.|$|R
50|$|However, more pertinently {{the park}} is an {{important}} habitat to several species, including the Orange-bellied Parrot (<b>Neophema</b> <b>Chrysogaster)</b> and freshwater fish Pedder Galaxia (Galaxias pedderensis), that are listed as critically endangered and extinct in the wild respectively under both Australian Commonwealth and Tasmanian legislation.|$|R
50|$|Of the threatened, {{endangered}} and {{the eight}} {{species that are}} simply endemic to the park, such as the Fairy Tern, Wedge-tail Eagle, Green Rosella and Dusky Robin respectively, the species that adds to the park’s cultural and conservation uniqueness is the <b>Neophema</b> <b>Chrysogaster,</b> or more simply the Orange-bellied Parrot.|$|R
50|$|The {{lakes and}} lagoons are {{particularly}} important habitats for waterbirds such as black swan, grey teal, Pacific black duck, and especially the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster)</b> which winters here {{along with many other}} birds including the red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis), sharp-tailed sandpiper (Calidris acuminata), and curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea).|$|R
50|$|The {{orange-bellied parrot}} (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster)</b> {{is a small}} broad-tailed parrot endemic to {{southern}} Australia, and {{one of only three}} species of parrot that migrate. It was described by Latham in 1790. A small parrot around 20 cm long, it exhibits sexual dimorphism. The adult male is distinguished by its bright grass-green upperparts, yellow underparts and orange belly patch. The adult female and juvenile are duller green in colour. All birds have a blue frontal band and blue outer wing feathers.|$|R
50|$|It {{is home to}} over 150 bird species. Several {{migratory species}} are listed the under {{international}} agreements Japan Australia Migratory Bird Agreement and the China Australia Migratory Bird Agreement. Twelve {{plant and animal species}} are listed as threatened under Victoria’s Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 including the orange-bellied parrot. According to The Action Plan for Australian Birds by the Natural Heritage Trust, the orange-bellied parrot (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster)</b> is critically endangered with approximately 180 mature birds remaining in the wild, and numbers continuing to decline. The reserve is part of the Bellarine Wetlands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for orange-bellied parrots and for waterbirds.|$|R
5000|$|Some 193 km2 of the island, {{consisting}} of the coastline in a strip extending from the low water mark to one kilometre inland of the high-water mark around the entire island, with a broader area encompassing Lavinia State Reserve in the north-east, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). The main feature making it an IBA is that it supports the small population of critically endangered orange-bellied parrots (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster)</b> on the migration route between their breeding grounds in south-western Tasmania and their wintering grounds in mainland south-eastern Australia. [...] And more recently the King Island Biodiversity Management Plan 2012-2022 identified Lake Flannigan as important in this regard.|$|R
40|$|In early 2010, after 27 {{years of}} {{recovery}} effort, the orange-bellied parrot (OBP; <b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster)</b> {{was expected to}} be extinct in the wild within a few years. Shortly before the imminent wild extinction became evident, we surveyed landholders (114 responses of 783 surveys delivered) in part of the main non-breeding area, according to three classes of modelled habitat suitability (2 ̆ 7 high 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 medium 2 ̆ 7, and 2 ̆ 7 low 2 ̆ 7). Predictions of the habitat models appear to correlate with landholder perceptions of the presence of OBP habitat on private land, thus the models appear a tractable way to identify key stakeholders worthy of priority consultation in relation to habitat works. Landholders were sympathetic to wetlands and birds, including OBPs (89. 4...|$|R
40|$|Two {{new species}} of gall midge {{associated}} with two distinct galls on the succulent creeping shrub Sarcocornia quinqueflora are described from salt marshes in south-eastern Australia. The infestations caused by the new species hinder the growth of S. quinqueflora, the seeds of which are the major food of the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot <b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster.</b> Asphondylia floriformis sp. n. Veenstra-Quah & Kolesik transforms leaf segments into flower-like galls, whereas Asphondylia sarcocorniae sp. n. Veenstra-Quah & Kolesik produces simple swellings on branches. Both galls have fungal mycelium growing in the apoplast of the gall tissue and lining the inner surface of the larval chamber where it is presumably grazed by the larva. Descriptions of the larvae, pupae, males, females and the geographical distribution of the two gall midges in south-eastern Australia are given. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Failure to {{act quickly}} on {{evidence}} of rapid population decline {{has led to the}} first mammal extinction in Australia in the last 50 years, the Christmas Island Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus murrayi). The fate of another iconic species, the migratory Orange-bellied Parrot (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster),</b> monitored intensively for over 20 years, hangs in the balance. To inform future conservation management and decision making, we investigate the decision process that has led to the plight of both species. Our analysis suggests three globally relevant recommendations for minimizing species extinction worldwide: (1) informed, empowered, and responsive governance and leadership is essential; (2) processes that ensure institutional accountability must be in place, and; (3) decisions must be made whilst there is an opportunity to act. The bottom line is that, unless responsive and accountable institutional processes are in place, decisions will be delayed and extinction will occur...|$|R
5000|$|Carpenter Rocks Conservation Park is a {{protected}} area {{located in the}} Limestone Coast of South Australia about 40 km south-west of Mount Gambier and about 1.5 km south east of the township of Carpenter Rocks. The conservation park was proclaimed on 6 September 2001 under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 to protect threatened species and vegetation communities in particular: A number of threatened species and plant communities are conserved within the park. It protects part of the only known population of Carpenter Rocks Manna Gum (Eucalyptus splendens ssp. arcana), which is a newly-described species, along with several other plants of national, state or regional significance. The park protects significant habitat for the Orange-bellied Parrot (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster),</b> which is critically endangered at a national level. This important threatened species was recorded more regularly at the Carpenter Rocks site {{than at any other}} site in South Australia during the 1980s and early 1990s. [...] The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area.|$|R
40|$|Two {{new species}} of gall midge {{associated}} with two leaf galls on the branched, perennial shrub Tecticornia arbuscula are described from saltmarshes in south-eastern Australia. The infestations caused by the new species hinder the growth of T. arbuscula which can impact on the critically endangered Orange Bellied Parrot (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster)</b> : T. arbuscula provides perching and roosting sites and the seeds are the major food source for this bird. Asphondylia tecticorniae sp. n. Veenstra & Kolesik transforms leaf segments into single-chambered, spherical galls, whereas Asphondylia peelei sp. n. Veenstra & Kolesik produces a multi-chambered, asymmetrical gall on leaves of the same plant. Both galls have fungal mycelium lining the inner surface of the larval chamber where it is presumably grazed on by the larva. Descriptions of the larvae, pupae, males, females and geographical distribution of the two gall midges in south-eastern Australia are given. Differences {{in the level of}} parasitoid infestation of four Asphondylia species feeding on Australian Chenopodiaceae in relation to putative oviposition sites on the host plants are explored...|$|R
40|$|With an {{increasing}} demand and reliance on volunteers {{in a host}} of different sectors, the need for organisations to understand motivating factors behind volunteering, and how to retain volunteer services, is crucial. This paper examines the recruitment, retention and attrition among a group of volunteers participating in a long-term monitoring program for the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot <b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster.</b> This project is one of the longest running of its type in Australia with more than 20 years of survey activities. Volunteers were most often recruited via other environmental agencies. Almost three-quarters of respondents had been involved in birdwatching or other bird monitoring activities usually in connection with conservation organisations. The modal response was an involvement of 10 - 20 years, with most other responses in the range 0 - 5 years. The majority intend to continue volunteering, but cited perceived health and time commitments as the main factors behind possible future decisions to cease volunteering. Respondents suggested improvements in the volunteer management of the program, and in particular, thought a personal 2 ̆ 7 thank you 2 ̆ 7, would maintain motivation and participation...|$|R
40|$|Quasispecies {{variants}} and recombination {{were studied}} longitudinally in an emergent outbreak of beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) {{infection in the}} orange-bellied parrot (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster).</b> Detailed health monitoring and the small population size (, 300 individuals) of this critically endangered bird provided an opportunity to longitudinally track viral replication and mutation events occurring in a circular, single-stranded DNA virus {{over a period of}} four years within a novel bottleneck population. Optimized PCR was used with different combinations of primers, primer walking, direct amplicon sequencing and sequencing of cloned amplicons to analyze BFDV genome variants. Analysis of complete viral genomes (n = 16) and Rep gene sequences (n = 35) revealed that the outbreak was associated with mutations in functionally important regions of the normally conserved Rep gene and immunogenic capsid (Cap) gene with a high evolutionary rate (3. 4161023 subs/site/year) approaching that for RNA viruses; simultaneously we observed significant evidence of recombination hotspots between two distinct progenitor genotypes within orange-bellied parrots indicating early cross-transmission of BFDV in the population. Multiple quasispecies variants were also demonstrated with at least 13 genotypic variants identified in four different individual birds, with one containing up to seven genetic variants. Preferential PC...|$|R
50|$|Butcher Gap Conservation Park is a {{protected}} area {{located in the}} Limestone Coast of South Australia overlooking Lacepede Bay about 6 km south {{of the town of}} Kingston SE. The conservation park was proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 in 1990. The following statements from the conservation park’s management plan summarises its conservation significance:The Park comprises the foredune and associated swale system surrounding a 40 ha wetland area (including Salt lake and Butchers lake), bisected by the Butcher Gap Drain… The wetland supports an association of dense South Australian swamp paperbark (Melaleuca halmaturorum) over marine meadow, while the remainder of the Park is a coastal scrub association. A lease of the area of Butcher Gap drain that bisects the Park has been negotiated with the South Eastern Water Conservation and Drainage Board. The Park is an important seasonal habitat for migratory bird species. The wetlands support a variety of waterfowl, including some migratory waders, however, its value to these species is not well understood… The Park is recognised as suitable habitat for the endangered orange-bellied parrot (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster),</b> which has been observed feeding on two-horned searocket (Cakile maritima) near the beach and in the extensive samphire habitat around Salt Lake.The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.|$|R
40|$|We {{analysed}} the supportive {{social networks}} {{associated with the}} conservation of six threatened Australian bird taxa, {{in one of the}} first network analyses of threatened species conservation programmes. Each example showed contrasting vulnerabilities. The Alligator Rivers yellow chat Epthianura crocea tunneyi had the smallest social network and no real action was supported. For the Capricorn yellow chat Epthianura crocea macgregori the network was centred on one knowledgeable and committed actor. The orange-bellied parrot <b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster</b> had a strongly connected recovery team but gaps in the overall network could limit communication. The recovery teams for the swift parrot Lathamus discolor and Baudin 2 ̆ 7 s black-cockatoo Calyptorhynchus baudinii had strong links among most stakeholders but had weak ties to the timber industry and orchardists, respectively, limiting their capacity to manage threatening processes. Carnaby 2 ̆ 7 s black cockatoo Calyptorhynchus latirostris seemed to have the most effective social network of any of the taxa studied but may be vulnerable to skill shortages. In each case the network analysis pointed to gaps that could be filled to enhance the conservation effort, and highlighted the importance of recovery teams. The research suggests that formal network analysis could assist in the design of more effective support mechanisms for the conservation of threatened species...|$|R
40|$|In early 2010, after 27 {{years of}} {{recovery}} effort, the orange-bellied parrot (OBP; <b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster)</b> {{was expected to}} be extinct in the wild within a few years. Shortly before the imminent wild extinction became evident, we surveyed landholders (114 responses of 783 surveys delivered) in part of the main non-breeding area, according to three classes of modelled habitat suitability (′high′, ′medium′, and ′low′). Predictions of the habitat models appear to correlate with landholder perceptions of the presence of OBP habitat on private land, thus the models appear a tractable way to identify key stakeholders worthy of priority consultation in relation to habitat works. Landholders were sympathetic to wetlands and birds, including OBPs (89. 4 % were aware of OBPs). Most indicated that they would be upset if the OBP went extinct and agreed that critical habitat should be protected; 80. 7 % were prepared to consider changes to the way they managed their land to benefit the species, and sought more information on how they could do so (64. 0 %). This study suggests that the habitat model usefully identified key stakeholders and the OBP enjoyed high awareness, concern, and engagement among many stakeholders, shortly before the species was considered functionally extinct. The maintenance of landholder support is likely to be critical if future attempts are made to reintroduce the species to the wild...|$|R
40|$|A {{suite of}} {{polymorphic}} microsatellite markers and the complete mitochondrial genome sequence {{was developed by}} next generation sequencing (NGS) for the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot, <b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster.</b> A total of 14 polymorphic loci were identified and characterized using DNA extractions representing 40 individuals from Melaleuca, Tasmania, sampled in 2002. We observed moderate genetic variation across most loci (mean number of alleles per locus = 2. 79; mean expected heterozygosity = 0. 53) with no evidence of individual loci deviating significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Marker independence was confirmed with tests for linkage disequilibrium, and analyses indicated no evidence of null alleles across loci. De novo and reference-based genome assemblies performed using MIRA were used to assemble the N. chrysogaster mitochondrial genome sequence with mean coverage of 116 -fold (range 89 to 142 -fold). The mitochondrial genome consists of 18, 034 base pairs, and a typical metazoan mitochondrial gene content consisting of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal subunit genes, 22 transfer RNAs, and a single large non-coding region (control region). The arrangement of mitochondrial genes is also typical of Avian taxa. The annotation of the mitochondrial genome and the characterization of 14 microsatellite markers provide a valuable resource for future genetic monitoring of wild and captive N. chrysogaster populations. As found previously, NGS provides a rapid, low cost and reliable method for polymorphic nuclear genetic marker development and determining complete mitochondrial genome sequences when {{only a fraction of}} a genome is sequenced...|$|R
40|$|Artificial tree hollows (nest or roost boxes) {{may be of}} {{considerable}} importance to the conservation and management of Australian hollow-using birds and microbats. This is suggested by recognition {{that the rate of}} collapse of hollow-bearing trees may exceed replacement in some landscapes. We review the published literature to synthesise current information on the use of artificial hollows by Australian birds and bats, and to provide guidance to future research and management. The use of artificial hollows has been documented in some detail for 15 native bird and eight microbat species. A range of hollow designs has been employed but there is a limited understanding of favoured designs. General designs (e. g. front-entry plywood boxes) have been used extensively by some species and should continue to be used until more effective designs are identified. Species tend to use artificial hollows that have entrance sizes just sufficient for their body size, and this should guide hollow design. Competitive interactions with a range of non-target species (native and non-native) may have a pronounced influence on artificial hollow use and must be considered in any management program involving artificial hollows. We highlight some design elements that may reduce interference by non-target species. Temperature inside artificial hollows may have a particular influence on their use by bats due to the role of microclimate in bat thermoregulation. Trials are needed to investigate this factor and to inform general approaches to positioning of artificial hollows. Several distinct management uses exist for artificial hollows, including assisting threatened species recovery, e. g. Kangaroo Island glossy black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus) and orange-bellied parrot (<b>Neophema</b> <b>chrysogaster).</b> Artificial hollows offer an interim solution to hollow shortage but their full potential will only be realised when preferences for different designs are better understood. This will require a commitment to monitoring and should be conducted in an adaptive management context. Increased knowledge of the use of artificial hollows by Australian birds and bats should be of global relevance to the management of hollow-using species because it provides an independent test of ideas and strengthens any generalisations...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years declining {{rainfall}} and increased aquifer abstraction have heavily impacted water availability and ecosystems on the Gnangara Groundwater System (GGS). The mammal fauna {{of the area}} is considered to have been rich, with up to 28 terrestrial and 5 volant native species recorded since European settlement. This study investigated previous and current distribution of mammals on the GGS, and assessed potential impacts of predicted rainfall and groundwater declines on mammals. A general survey was conducted at 40 sites, and targeted trapping was undertaken for Hydromys chrysogaster and Isoodon obesulus fusciventer at wetlands. Nine native and seven introduced terrestrial mammal species were recorded during the general survey and capture rates were very low (1. 05 %). The most commonly captured native species was Tarsipes rostratus. There is evidence that only 11 (9 recorded and 2 considered to be extant) of the 28 historically recorded terrestrial native mammals still persist in the area. The species predicted to be most susceptible to rainfall and groundwater level declines include H. <b>chrysogaster,</b> <b>I.</b> obesulus fusciventer, and T. rostratus. Management and recovery actions required to protect mammals under predicted climatic changes include identification and maintenance of refugia and ecological linkages, supplementation of lakes, development of ecologically appropriate fire regimes, and control of predators...|$|R
