5|$|By definition, {{there is}} no serious {{underlying}} medical condition, and most importantly, the ulcers do not represent oral cancer nor are they infectious. However, aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort. There is a spectrum of severity, with symptoms ranging from a minor nuisance to disabling. Due to pain during eating, weight loss may develop {{as a result of}} <b>not</b> <b>eating</b> in severe cases of aphthous stomatitis. Usually, the condition lasts for several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life.|$|E

5|$|The Restaurant {{was later}} {{seen as the}} start of a {{movement}} in London wherein high-end restaurants were moved into hotels. This was followed in 1999 by Koffman moving La Tante Claire from its Royal Hospital Road location into The Berkeley hotel. The Restaurant's location in a hotel was thought at the time to have changed the mantra of <b>not</b> <b>eating</b> in a hotel-based restaurant to one where it was more openly acceptable.|$|E

[...] "I will <b>not</b> <b>eat</b> bread" [...] or [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>eat</b> bread". Plain {{negative}} forms are actually i-adjectives (see below) and inflect as such, e.g. Pan o tabenakatta (...) [...] "I did <b>not</b> <b>eat</b> bread".|$|R
5|$|As a vegetarian, Higgins {{promoted}} {{the health benefits}} of <b>not</b> <b>eating</b> meat in a 2005 advertising campaign by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA); and has supported their anti-fur stance. She is interested in environmental issues and is involved with the Sierra Club, a grassroots organisation based in California. She has protested against the proposed industrialisation of the Kimberley region of Western Australia and donated the royalties from her 2009 EP More Than This.

5|$|In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, {{receiving}} vital colostrum milk. Lambs {{that either}} fail to nurse or are prevented {{from doing so}} by the ewe require aid in order to live. If coaxing the pair to accept nursing does not work, one of several steps may then be taken. Ewes may be held or tied {{to force them to}} accept a nursing lamb. If a lamb is <b>not</b> <b>eating,</b> a stomach tube may also be used to force feed the lamb in order to save its life. In the case of a permanently rejected lamb, a shepherd may then attempt to foster an orphaned lamb onto another ewe. Lambs are also sometimes fostered after the death of their mother, either from the birth or other event.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for <b>not</b> <b>eating</b> the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E
50|$|Matzah brei is {{commonly}} eaten as a breakfast food during Passover, when only unleavened bread is permitted. However, some Jews do <b>not</b> <b>eat</b> matzah brei during Passover {{because they do}} <b>not</b> <b>eat</b> gebrochts, matzo that has {{come into contact with}} water.|$|R

Reynolds underwent back surgery in 2009 and a quintuple heart bypass in February 2010.|$|E

25|$|The Kaifeng Jews intermarried {{with local}} Chinese {{sufficiently}} to be indistinguishable in appearance from their non-Jewish neighbors. One trait that differentiated {{them from their}} neighbors was <b>not</b> <b>eating</b> pork. Qu Yinan, a Chinese woman who discovered her Jewish ancestry after her mother attended a conference on minorities in 1981, says her family did not eat pork or shellfish and her grandfather always wore a blue skullcap.|$|E
25|$|Meat {{is part of}} {{the human}} diet in most cultures, where it often has {{symbolic}} meaning and important social functions. Many people, however, choose not to eat meat (this is referred to as vegetarianism) or any food made from animals (veganism). The reasons for <b>not</b> <b>eating</b> all or some meat may include ethical objections to killing animals for food, health concerns, environmental concerns or religious dietary laws.|$|E
25|$|The long-standing Roman Catholic {{tradition}} of <b>not</b> <b>eating</b> meat on Fridays, especially during Lent, and of substituting fish for meat {{on that day}} continues to influence habits even in predominantly Protestant, Anglican, semi-secular and secular societies. Friday night remains a traditional occasion for eating fish-and-chips; and many cafeterias and similar establishments, while varying their menus on other days of the week, habitually offer fish and chips every Friday.|$|E

25|$|Treatment {{involves}} {{administration of}} {{large volumes of}} intravenous fluids, which can become very costly. Antibiotics are often given if deemed appropriate based on the presumed underlying cause and the horse's CBC results. Therapy to help prevent endotoxemia and improve blood protein levels (plasma or synthetic colloid administration) may also be used if budgetary constraints allow. Other therapies include probiotics and anti-inflammatory medication. Horses that are <b>not</b> <b>eating</b> well may also require parenteral nutrition. Horses usually require 3–6 days of treatment before clinical signs improve.|$|E
25|$|Cookery D also {{contains}} the one incunabulum in the Cookery Collection, which the Library received from Blanche Leigh's donation. Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum is a poem which offers the reader a health regime and advice about keeping a good diet. For example, it recommends <b>not</b> <b>eating</b> too much. The exact {{date of the}} copy in the Cookery Collection is unknown but it {{is thought to be}} post 1500 and is cited in The British Library's Incunabula Short Title Catalogue. The printer Bernardino dei Vitali was active from 1494 to 1539.|$|E
25|$|After {{five years}} of work, Matzeliger {{obtained}} a patent for his invention in 1883.

He sacrificed his health working exhausting hours on his invention and <b>not</b> <b>eating</b> {{over long periods of}} time, he caught a cold which quickly developed into tuberculosis. His early death in Lynn, Massachusetts from tuberculosis meant he never saw the full profit of his invention. He died on August 24, 1889, three weeks shy of his 37th birthday.|$|E
