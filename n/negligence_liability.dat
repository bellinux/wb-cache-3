50|$|Stovin v Wise is a {{decision}} of major significance {{in the development of}} <b>negligence</b> <b>liability</b> in English law.

50|$|For an {{exclusion}} clause to operate, it must cover the breach (assuming there {{actually is a}} breach of contract). If there is, then the type of liability arising is also important.

The justices therefore felt that the rule should be done away with and so the independent contractor was not liable under that, but could only be culpable in the law of negligence.|$|E

50|$|In {{the common}} law of England and Wales there is no {{criminal}} liability for failing {{to act in the}} event of another person being in danger; however, there are exceptions to this rule. In instances where there has been an assumption of responsibility by the bystander, a dangerous situation was created by them, or there is a contractual or statutory duty to act, criminal liability would be imposed on the bystander for their failure to take action. The courts are reluctant to penalize people attempting rescue and English law makes provision for the actions of 'good Samaritans,' unless their actions were grossly negligent or made a situation worse.Cases such as Donoghue v Stevenson where Lord Atkin culminates the parable of the good samaritan principle to 'love your neighbour' transposed in law for <b>negligence</b> <b>liability.</b> Donoghue won the case.|$|E

5000|$|Clause 8 {{said the}} Crown would keep a freight shed in repair, where Canada Steamship’s goods were being stored.

Clause 7 said ‘the lessee shall not have any claim… for… damage… to… goods… being… in the said shed.’ Clause 17 said “the lessee shall at all times indemnify ... the lessor from and against all claims ... by whomsoever made ... in any manner based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these presents, or any action taken or things done ... by virtue hereof, or the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder.” Lord Morton of Henryton for the Privy Council said that clause 7 did not exclude <b>negligence</b> <b>liability</b> in clear enough terms and clause 17 was ambiguous and would be construed against the Crown. The Crown could realistically be said to have been strictly liable for damage to the goods (e.g. by breach of obligation to keep the shed in repair) and were therefore negligence should not be covered. He set out these principles.(1) if a clause expressly excludes liability for negligence (or an appropriate synonym [...] ) then effect is given to that. If not, (2) ask whether the words are wide enough to exclude negligence and if there is doubt that is resolved against the one relying on the clause. If that is satisfied then (3) ask whether the clause could cover some alternative liability other than for negligence, and if it can it covers that.|$|E
