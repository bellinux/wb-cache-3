40|$|The work {{covers the}} neuronic {{networks}} (synergetical model, its abilities to structural identification of technological processes). The {{aim is to}} study the neuronic networks {{as a base for}} the structural identifiers in adaptive control systems. The analysis of exsistence and stability for stationary solutions in the <b>neuronics</b> network has been performed firstrly. The conditions determining the phase space structure have been revealed. The new model of the pattern classification has been proposed, the methods for structural identification of the technological processes on base of the neuronic networks have been proposed. The subsystem for structural identification of the technological processes has been constructed. The facilities permitting to make such subsystems with required properties have been proposed. The software-hardware complex for structural identification of the optic fibre draft has been constructed. The software-hardware complex for identification of the optic fibre draft has been introduced in the Special Design Office of Cable Industry, the software of the individual identification has been introduced in the Internal Affairs Board of c.

40|$|Abstract Fall {{accidents}} {{leads to}} an average of three deaths a day in Sweden. The high mortality and morbidity associated with falls among elderly is due to a high risk of falling caused by impaired mobility, sight and balance in combination with increased vulnerability as a result of fragile bones as well as comorbid conditions. Researchers at the department of <b>Neuronics</b> at KTH has developed a shock-absorbing floor that aim {{to reduce the risk of}} fall related fractures. The floors has shown promising results in mechanical drop tests but requires further analysis before it can be implemented in retirement homes. The goal of this master thesis is to refine, adapt and validate the finite element model THUMS 4. 02 for fall simulations. The model will then be used to analyze the shock absorbing ability of various floor systems. Model adaptations included modification of the material properties of the adipose tissue and cartilage in the hips and implantation of tied internal contacts. Validation was performed against data from two experimental studies selected in a literature study, dynamic impact with isolated pelvis and lateral hip impact of complete PMHS. The experimental setups were reproduced in LS-Dyna and relatively close agreement for the force curves could be displayed in both cases. The model also showed realistic force response for fall simulations and a force reduction with up to 23 % in simulation to the KTH developed floor system, differences could be seen for different fall positions of the model. Fall simulations agreed well with clinically and scientifically documented fracture loads and patterns. Further studies needs to be performed to further validate the model and analyze effect of different geometrical properties of floor system...|$|E
40|$|Fall {{accidents}} are {{the type of}} accident in Sweden that cause most deaths, {{the largest number of}} hospitalizations, and most visits to the emergency room. The elderly are overrepresented in the statistics and with the aging population the costs are increasing. One way of reducing both the personal suffering and the cost to society is to introduce safety flooring. Svein Kleiven and Hans von Holst, professors at the department of <b>Neuronics</b> at KTH, have developed a new type of flooring system aimed to reduce fall related injuries. A first test area has been installed at a care facility and the Technical Research Institute of Sweden, SP, has conducted drop tests on nine different prototypes and found a reduction in impact force between 60 - 75 % compared to a wooden flooring. The goals of this Master’s thesis were to conduct material testing to enable a better validation of the finite element (FE) model of the flooring system, validate a FE human body model for a hip impact and conduct fall simulations. The last goal was to evaluate the test area of the flooring system regarding effect on balance and work environment. Tensile tests were conducted to increase the knowledge regarding the different rubber mixtures and surface floors used in prototypes of the flooring system. The human body model had to be modified in regards to material models and anatomy of the hip joint before validated. Two fall simulations were conducted, however with low confidence in the results {{due to the lack of}} expected response in the model of the flooring system. A walking test was conducted to investigate if the flooring system affected the balance for the elderly and a questionnaire was created to get subjective ratings from the members of staff at the care facility. The results indicate no clear effect on balance and the subjective ratings shows the importance of also consider the work environment before installing the flooring system. More work remains in developing the flooring system; however this Master’s thesis has increased the understanding of the flooring system, both in regards to material properties and influence on the daily life at the care facility. This thesis also developed a more realistic human model, to be used in further hip impact simulations. ...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} model for {{predicting}} skull fractures of a 50 th percentile male, using a finite element head model developed at the <b>Neuronics</b> department of KTH, Royal Instituteof Technology. The skull bone is modeled as a three layered bone, where the outer and inner tables are modeled as shell elements, while the diploë is modeled by two layers of solid elements. The material model of the tables was changed from the material model MAT_PLASTIC_KINEMATIC to a material model including a damage parameter to soften the damaged material and to enable ploting of the damage of the skull bone. Due to the coarse mesh of the FE head model the material model was not allowed to include any erosion, deleting element as they reach their ultimate strain. With these requests, two materials from the LS-DYNA material library seemed appropriate: material 81,MAT_PLASTICITY_WITH_DAMAGE and material 105, MAT_DAMAGE_ 2. To evaluate these materials and adjust the input parameters a dog bone FE model was developed and tension tests were simulated with this model, equivalent to tension tests performed on equally shaped skull bone specimens. The material simulating a behavior most similar to the behavior from the tension tests turned out to be material 81. This material model was then implemented in the full FE head model for further input parameter adjustment and validation. Four different cadaver experiments were simulated, with different impacting objects: sphere, box, cylinder and flat cylinder surface, and impacted areas of the head: vertex, temporo-parietal and frontal. The forces obtained in the simulations were compared to the forces of the cadaver experiments. The fracture prediction was based on the damage parameter, which could be plotted to visualize the areas where the ultimate strain was exceeded and thereby the area most likely to be fractured. This parameter was then compared to the documented fractures from the cadaver experiments. The result showed that using material 81 with the input parameter EPPFR= 0. 05 gave the overall most accurate forces and fracture predictions. The breaking stress, σB, did not affect the fractures significantly but a reduced σB resulted in reduction of the peak forces. The thickness of the diploë did not have any significant impact on the fracture occurrence, but a thinner diploë had a reducing impact on the peak forces as well...|$|E
