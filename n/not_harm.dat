5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might bring}} to Earth pathogens or invasive life forms that do <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> its own biosphere. Alien pathogens could decimate the human population, {{which would have}} no immunity to them, or they might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans. Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.|$|E
5|$|Superstition in the {{northeast}} (Maine and New Brunswick) relates how woodsmen would <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> gorbeys as they believed that whatever they inflicted on the bird would be done to them. A folk tale circulated {{about a man who}} plucked a gorbey of its feathers and later woke up the next morning having lost all his hair. Although the story was widespread in the early to mid-20th century, it {{does not appear to have}} been extant in 1902.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{is named after}} Richard Appel's wife, who is the novelist Mona Simpson. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Her crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> anyone and was only caught because {{she came back to}} help Mr. Burns.|$|E

5|$|While {{attending}} school at Trinity College, Cambridge, Daniel becomes Newton's companion, ensuring that Newton does <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> his health and assisting in his experiments. However, {{the plague of}} 1665 forces them apart: Newton returns to his family manor and Daniel {{to the outskirts of}} London. Daniel quickly tires of the radical Puritan rhetoric of his father, Drake Waterhouse, and decides to join Reverend John Wilkins and Robert Hooke at John Comstock's Epsom estate.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 14th century, {{the castle}} was used as a refuge by Richard II from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke. On 12August 1399, after {{returning}} from Ireland, Richard {{made his way to the}} castle where he met Bolingbroke's emissary, Henry Percy, for negotiations. Percy swore in the chapel he would <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> the king. On 19 August, Richard surrendered to Percy at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. The king was then taken to London and died later in captivity at Pontefract Castle.|$|E
5|$|Captain Francis Laforey on Carysfort {{immediately}} {{attacked the}} larger ship {{and in an}} engagement lasting an hour and fifteen minutes successfully forced its captain to surrender, discovering a number of British prisoners of war below decks. Castor was subsequently taken back to Britain and an extended legal case ensued between the Admiralty and Captain Laforey over the amount of prize money that should be awarded for the victory. Ultimately Laforey was successful, {{in part due to}} testimony from the defeated French captain, proving his case and claiming the prize money. The lawsuit did <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> Laforey's career and he later served at the Battle of Trafalgar and became a prominent admiral.|$|E

5|$|In the episode, the Doctor—a time {{travelling}} alien {{played by}} Matt Smith—and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) land in Wales in 2020, where a drilling operation headed by Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) is drilling {{deep into the}} earth and disrupting a civilisation of Silurians who dwell beneath the earth. The Silurians cause holes {{to open in the}} earth, one of which consumes Amy. The Doctor and Rory capture one Silurian, Alaya (Neve McIntosh), and the Doctor instructs Rory and a local family to <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> Alaya, as it could spark a war. He then takes Nasreen in the TARDIS to the Silurian civilisation to rescue Amy and a local boy.|$|E
5|$|Some levels contain puzzles {{that may}} require {{use of the}} Force to overcome, or by {{locating}} certain objects in the level. There {{are a variety of}} hostile and non-hostile NPCs within each level with whom the player can interact. Other enemies include monsters and vehicles. There are two endings to Jedi Knight, depending on how the player plays the game. If the player does <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> non-hostile NPCs and focuses on collecting light Force powers, the player will get the light side ending. Conversely if the player harms non-hostile NPCs and collects dark Force powers, the game will end with the dark side ending.|$|E
5|$|The {{antelope}} is {{native to}} and found mainly in India, while it is extinct in Bangladesh. Formerly widespread, only small, scattered herds are seen today, largely confined to protected areas. During the 20th century, blackbuck numbers declined sharply due to excessive hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation. The blackbuck has been introduced in Argentina and the United States. In India, hunting of blackbuck is prohibited under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The blackbuck has significance in Hinduism; Indian and Nepali villagers do <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> the antelope.|$|E

5|$|The {{blackbuck}} has {{associations with}} the Indian culture. The antelope {{might have been}} a source of food in the Indus Valley civilisation (33001700 BCE); bone remains have been discovered in sites such as Dholavira and Mehrgarh. The blackbuck is routinely depicted in miniature paintings of the Mughal era (16th to 19th centuries) depicting royal hunts often using cheetahs. Villagers in India and Nepal generally do <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> the blackbuck. Tribes such as the Bishnois revere and care for most animals including the blackbuck. The blackbuck has been declared as the state animal of Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
5|$|The nominal heir of Perdiccas, his son Amyntas IV, was at {{this time}} still an infant. Philip, the sole {{surviving}} son of Amyntas III, was the obvious candidate to rule Macedon and was acclaimed by the army, probably as king. It {{is also possible that}} he was initially acclaimed as regent for his nephew Amyntas IV, and later usurped the throne, although if so, he did <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> Amyntas. Either way, Philip II became king by 359 BC, and began energetically attempting to save Macedon from destruction.|$|E
5|$|The society's early {{meetings}} included experiments performed {{first by}} Hooke {{and then by}} Denis Papin, who was appointed in 1684. These experiments varied in their subject area, and were both important in some cases and trivial in others. The society also published an English translation of Essays of Natural Experiments Made in the Accademia del Cimento, under the Protection of the Most Serene Prince Leopold of Tuscany in 1684, an Italian book documenting experiments at the Accademia del Cimento. Although meeting at Gresham College, the Society temporarily moved to Arundel House in 1666 after the Great Fire of London, which did <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> Gresham but did lead to its appropriation by the Lord Mayor. The Society returned to Gresham in 1673.|$|E

5|$|Many parasites {{latch onto}} whales, notably whale lice and whale barnacles. Almost all species of whale lice are {{specialized}} towards a certain species of whale, and {{there can be}} more than one species per whale. Whale lice eat dead skin, resulting in minor wounds in the skin. Whale louse infestations are especially evident in right whales, where colonies propagate on their callosities. Though not a parasite, whale barnacles latch onto the skin of a whale during their larval stage. However, in doing so it does <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> nor benefit the whale, so their relationship is often labeled as an example of commensalism. Some baleen whales will deliberately rub themselves on substrate to dislodge parasites. Some species of barnacle, such as Conchoderma auritum and whale barnacles, attach to the baleen plates, though this seldom occurs. A species of copepod, Balaenophilus unisetus, inhabits baleen plates of whales in tropical waters. A species of Antarctic diatom, Cocconeis ceticola, forms a film on the skin, which takes a month to develop; this film causes minor damage to the skin. They are also plagued by internal parasites such as stomach worms, cestodes, nematodes, liver flukes, and acanthocephalans.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana (5th to 4th century BCE) by Valmiki {{does not}} mention Maya Sita. Sita, the princess of Mithila, is married to Rama, the prince of Ayodhya. Rama is forced {{to go on a}} 14-year exile and is {{accompanied}} by Sita and his brother Lakshmana. Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka, plots to abduct Sita, aided by Maricha, who transforms into a magical golden deer (Maya mriga, an illusional deer), that entices Sita. While in exile in Dandaka forest, Rama goes after the deer and slays it. The magical deer gives a call of help in Rama's voice. Sita forces Lakshmana to go and help Rama, leaving her alone. Ravana comes disguised as an ascetic and kidnaps her. He imprisons her in the Ashoka Vatika grove of Lanka, until she is rescued by Rama, who slays Ravana in war. When Rama doubts Sita's chastity, she undergoes a trial by fire (Agni Pariksha). Sita enters a burning pyre declaring that if she has been faithful to Rama let the fire <b>not</b> <b>harm</b> her; she comes out unscathed with the fire-god Agni as proof of her purity. Rama accepts Sita back and returns to Ayodhya, where they are crowned as king and queen.|$|E
