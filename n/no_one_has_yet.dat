5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.|$|E

25|$|Trevor Ellis, a 26-year-old from Brixton Hill, died {{following}} a shooting in Croydon, South London on 8 August. His family denied reports that Ellis, {{who had come}} from the Brixton area to Croydon with a group of friends, had been involved in looting. By 16 December 2013, 13 people had been arrested in connection with the murder. All were later bailed and then released without action. On 16 December, the eve of Ellis's birthday, detectives opened up a fresh appeal into the murder, asking for witnesses to come forward. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> been charged.|$|E
25|$|Three former {{officials}} of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's foreign surveillance department and criminal intelligence unit (Valeriy Kostenko, Mykola Protasov and Oleksandr Popovych) accused of his murder were arrested in March 2005 and a fourth one (Oleksiy Pukach, {{the former chief of}} the unit) in July 2009. A court in Ukraine sentenced Protasov to a sentence of 13 years and Kostenko and Popovych to 12-year terms March 2008 (the trial had begun January 2006) for the murder. Gongadze's family believe the trial had failed to bring the masterminds behind the killing to justice. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> been charged with giving the order for Gongadze's murder.|$|E

25|$|Richard Simon, biblical {{scholar and}} the first textual critic, dated the {{manuscript}} to the 10th century. According to palaeographer Bernard de Montfaucon and biblical scholar Scholz {{it was written in}} the 8th century. According to Leonard Hug, biblical scholar, it is not older than the ninth century, because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> shown that the compressed letters Σ, Ε, Ο, and Θ were ever used in manuscripts at so early a date as the 8th century.

25|$|Literally {{the four}} paths of distraint, a {{process by which}} one could, under certain circumstances, seize goods owed by another. However, in Brehon law one does not {{immediately}} own the property, rather animals are taken to an intermediary land to wait in case the original owner pays the debt. As time passes, the animals are slowly forfeited. This tract deals primarily with four types of distraint, divided based on the waiting period. The waiting period apparently varies based on the circumstance although <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> determined what exactly those circumstances are. Other material present includes information of other aspects of legal procedure and a long section where the author asks and then answers multiple times, why the tract is called Cethairslicht Athgabálae.|$|E
25|$|The two {{horsemen}} of {{this particular}} apocalypse—the external deficit and the swift rise of Central Bank credit—would have made 1988 a bad year no matter what else happened. But President García guaranteed financial disaster by his totally unexpected decision in July 1987 to nationalize the banks not already under government ownership. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> been able {{to explain why he}} decided to do so. It would not seem to have been a move necessary for any component of his program, or needed for government control in a banking sector in which it already had a dominant position. In any case, the action underlined the unilateral character of economic policy action under Peru's presidential system and wrecked any possibilities of further cooperation with private sector leadership. Private investment began to fall, and the whole economy followed it down shortly thereafter.|$|E

Others have argued that a [...] "top-down approach" [...] is more feasible. One such approach, successfully attempted by Craig Venter and others at J.

2500|$|Furman was an {{exceptional}} openings specialist, and was respected as being of virtually world-class strength with the White pieces, {{with which he}} scored most of his wins over the top players, as the game selection shows. He was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "the world champion when playing White." [...] He could not score anywhere near as well as Black, and this held back his success. While best remembered today as Karpov's trainer, Furman also made many important contributions to the success of other top players, such as Bronstein, Botvinnik, Korchnoi, and Geller. He developed several significant improvements to opening theory. He favoured the closed openings (1.d4, 1.c4, 1.Nf3) as White, and in many of his wins over top-class rivals, his opponents were simply unable to generate counterplay, and were slowly strangled by Furman's precise, yet amorphous strategy. Karpov noted that a book on Furman's career and best games would be well received and valuable; but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> taken up this challenge.|$|E
2500|$|On June 25, 2008, the Supreme Court, {{splitting}} 5–4, {{held that}} [...] "he Eighth Amendment bars Louisiana from imposing {{the death penalty}} for the rape of a child where the crime did not result, and was not intended to result, in the victim's death." [...] In its majority opinion authored by Justice Kennedy, the Court explained that the application of the death penalty had to rest on national consensus, and that as only six States permitted {{the death penalty for}} child rape, no such consensus existed. [...] "Unlike Louisiana, those states all require that a defendant have a previous rape conviction or some other aggravating factor in order to be subject to the death penalty, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> been sentenced to death under any of the laws." [...] In formulating the idea of [...] "national consensus" [...] the Court relied on the previous cases Roper v. Simmons (2005), which outlawed the execution of minors, and Coker v. Georgia (1977), which outlawed the application of the death penalty for the crime of rape. According to the Court, [...] "he death penalty is not a proportional punishment for the rape of a child." [...] The opinion, which was joined by the court's four more liberal judges, went on to state, [...] "The court concludes that there is a distinction between intentional first–degree murder, on the one hand, and non–homicide crimes against individuals, even including child rape, on the other. The latter crimes may be devastating in their harm, as here, but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public, they cannot compare to murder in their severity and irrevocability." [...] The opinion concluded that in cases of crimes against individuals, [...] "the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim’s life was not taken." ...|$|E
