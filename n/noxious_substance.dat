25|$|If {{irritants}} {{are present}} in the food, the enterochromaffin cells release more serotonin to make the gut move faster, i.e., to cause diarrhea, so the gut is emptied of the <b>noxious</b> <b>substance.</b> If serotonin is released in the blood faster than the platelets can absorb it, the level of free serotonin in the blood is increased. This activates 5-HT3 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone that stimulate vomiting. The enterochromaffin cells not only react to bad food but are also very sensitive to irradiation and cancer chemotherapy. Drugs that block 5HT3 are very effective in controlling the nausea and vomiting produced by cancer treatment, and are considered the gold standard for this purpose.|$|E
500|$|The {{common toad}} can reach about [...] in length. Females are {{normally}} stouter than males and southern specimens {{tend to be}} larger than northern ones. The head is broad with a wide mouth below the terminal snout which has two small nostrils. There are no teeth. The bulbous, protruding eyes have yellow or copper coloured irises and horizontal slit-shaped pupils. Just behind the eyes are two bulging regions, the paratoid glands, which are positioned obliquely. They contain a <b>noxious</b> <b>substance,</b> bufotoxin, {{which is used to}} deter potential predators. The head joins the body without a noticeable neck and there is no external vocal sac. The body is broad and squat and positioned close to the ground. The fore limbs are short with the toes of the fore feet turning inwards. At breeding time, the male develops nuptial pads on the first three fingers. He uses these to grasp the female when mating. The hind legs are short relative to other frogs' legs and the hind feet have long, unwebbed toes. There is no tail. The skin is dry and covered with small wart-like lumps. The colour is a fairly uniform shade of brown, olive-brown or greyish-brown, sometimes partly blotched or banded with a darker shade. The common toad tends to be sexually dimorphic with the females being browner and the males greyer. The underside is a dirty white speckled with grey and black patches.|$|E

50|$|The desert {{millipede}} is a {{very simple}} creature that will keep to itself unless bothered or feels threatened. It will curl up into a ball, or coil, when it is disturbed.

5000|$|The fragile file clam {{can swim}} slowly and {{continuously}} for about 5 {{minutes at a}} time. It does this by opening and closing its valves and expelling water in a stream from {{either side of the}} hinge, a form of jet propulsion. In an aquarium, the animal flits around knocking into other objects. It uses its mantle tentacles in an oar-like fashion when swimming. Sometimes it sheds the longest tentacles and can still swim effectively without them, increasing the frequency of valve clapping to maintain speed. [...] The detached tentacles secrete a <b>noxious</b> <b>substance</b> and continue to writhe after they are severed which may distract aggressors.|$|E

50|$|In March 1912 she {{was imprisoned}} in Holloway {{for four months}} for “damage” which was the smashing the windows of Marshall and Snelgrove’s shop in Oxford Street. In prison she participated in a hunger strike and had to force-fed. In 17 March 1913 was arrested under the name “Eleanor Cleary” for “ placing <b>noxious</b> <b>substance</b> in a Pillar-box work”. She was {{released}} after she paid a fine. In October 1913 she was arrested under the name “Irene Casey”, in Bradford was sentenced to three months and went on a hunger strike. She was released under the “Cat and Mouse” Act. She escaped by dressing in men’s attire while her mother, Isabella, dressed as Eileen. She was out for eight months when she was arrested on June 1914 in Nottingham for possession of explosives. She was sentenced to 15 months.|$|E
50|$|Prior to Donoghue v Stevenson {{liability}} for personal injury in tort usually depended upon showing physical damage inflicted directly (trespass to the person) or indirectly (trespass on the case). Being made ill by consuming a <b>noxious</b> <b>substance</b> did not qualify as either, so the orthodox {{view was that}} Mrs Donoghue had no sustainable claim in law. However, the decision fundamentally created {{a new type of}} liability in law which did not depend upon any previously recognised category of tortious claims. This was an evolutionary step in the common law for tort and delict, moving from strict liability based upon direct physical contact to a fault-based system which only required injury. This evolution was taken further in the later decision of Letang v Cooper 1965 1 QB 232 when it was held that actions should not be jointly pleaded in trespass and negligence, but in negligence alone.|$|E
