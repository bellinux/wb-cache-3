Annual exhibitors at the Royal Academy until 1884, they were best known for their designs of drinking fountains, and were employed by the Metropolitan Free Drinking Fountain Association and Coalbrookdale Company. They were noted for their cast-iron work in particular, made by the Coalbrookdale Company. In 1859 they were commissioned to design the [...] "People's Fountain" [...] for the Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council, costing £114 in total. of which £80 was for the sculpture, and completed in 1860. The 1.18m statue on a 93 cm high pedestal was relocated in 1866 to Bolton Park (later renamed Queen's Park).

40|$|The {{success of}} {{reinforcement}} learning in practical problems {{depends on the}} ability to combine function approximation with temporal difference methods such as value iteration. Experiments in this area have produced mixed results; there have been both <b>notable</b> successes and <b>notable</b> disappointments. Theory has been scarce, mostly due to the difficulty of reasoning about function approximators that generalize beyond the observed data. We provide a proof of convergence for a wide class of temporal difference methods involving function approximators such as k-nearest-neighbor, and show experimentally that these methods can be useful. The proof is based on a view of function approximators as expansion or contraction mappings. In addition, we present a novel view of fitted value iteration: an approximate algorithm for one environment turns out to be an exact algorithm for a different environment. 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND The problem of temporal credit assignment [...] - deciding which of a s [...] ...|$|R

Hotel Fontenelle was an upscale hotel downtown that was designed by local architect Thomas Rogers Kimball and built in 1913.
