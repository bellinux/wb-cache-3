25|$|After the enroute {{navigation}} {{test flight}} was completed, the AAIB's test pilot flew several approaches to Campbeltown Airport {{with the same}} aircraft while investigators monitored its position on the radar equipment that was used {{the night of the}} accident. When the test aircraft flew the approach as indicated on the <b>navigation</b> <b>chart</b> that was found clipped to the pilot's control wheel, there was a small gap in radar coverage when the aircraft was at its most distant point from the airport, beginning at 10.1nm and ending on the return segment at 9.4nm from the MAC VOR. Other trials were conducted at lower altitudes, and in those trials the coverage gap was widened considerably. Investigators tried approaches at low and descending altitudes involving a steeper left turn to 157° (where the heading bug was set on the HSI), and then flying that heading until intercepting the correct course to the MAC VOR. When this track was flown at 1,400 feet, the last radar contact was at 7.9nm from the MAC VOR. The last radar contact with the accident flight was at 8.1nm from the MAC VOR, at an altitude of 1,340 feet. Flying this track with the accident flight's known and projected descent profile brought the test aircraft to within 0.2nm of the crash site at an altitude of 200 feet, which was within the margin of error for the differences in wind {{on the day of the}} accident and on the day of the test flight.|$|E
