40|$|Developing {{a design}} {{philosophy}} to reduce carbon emissions from {{the built environment}} is a major motivator {{for the formation of}} the <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> concept. For <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>buildings</b> to be widely adopted, {{a deeper understanding of the}} drivers of their success is needed, as well as their comparative differences and similarities to buildings of more conventional design. This thesis investigates the effects of different building design and operation principles in relation to <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>buildings.</b> Simulations of three case study buildings (two of which are designed to be <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>energy)</b> were performed to identify the building design and operation elements which contribute most to energy efficiency. Through development and validation of building models of both <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> and conventional designs in this thesis, it was found that validation of smaller, more <b>energy</b> efficient <b>building</b> models can present challenges less commonly encountered in models of more conventional buildings. An understanding of the sensitivities of <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>buildings</b> to alterations in design and specification were gained. Results show that <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>buildings</b> are more sensitive to changes such as glazing type, and HVAC setpoint based on the case studies presented. This thesis has looked at quantifying the contribution of different building elements and systems to overall energy savings via simulation. The net impact of different glazing types, lighting control methods, window shading schedules, and HVAC set points on overall <b>building</b> <b>energy</b> consumption were examined. This thesis also reports on the <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> balance for one case study building. Results show that the building was net positive for the 12 -month period considered. Both energy imported/exported and energy generated/consumed were considered, as well as the load matching, grid interaction, and some preliminary analysis of power quality factors. These power quality factors and their relationship with <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>buildings</b> must be understood before the <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> concept can be widely adopted...|$|R

40|$|The Flemish Government has set {{the target}} to build only so called <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>{{buildings}}</b> by 2030, i. e. buildings which produce {{at least as much}} energy as they consume.

40|$|Given the {{implication}} of designing <b>Net</b> <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Buildings</b> (NZEBs), which involves complex passive and active design strategies, the use of computational automated optimization techniques is becoming more essential.

This work {{is part of the}} International Energy Agency (IEA) Task 40 : Towards <b>Net</b> <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Buildings</b> Subtask B. The objective of this report is to gain an understanding of how experts currently use optimization tools, which tools they use, the major limitations they have encountered, and their vision for the future of optimization of <b>Net</b> <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Buildings.</b> With this information disseminated, it is anticipated that soft ware developers will be better informed of the needs of building design processionals. A qualitative study design was employed, using semi structured interviews. Optimization experts working in academia and practice were recruited. The participants were identified from the IBPSA Conference Proceedings between 1995 and 2010. A sampling framework was developed to include experts in the study from Europe and North America. These groups represented the range of possible optimization users, from researchers and designers considered optimization in the design of <b>net</b> <b>zero</b> or high performance buildings. A list of potential optimization experts was created and circulated between the IEA Task 40 Subtask members. Also every interviewed expert was asked to revise the list and add any potential candidate to be interviewed...|$|R
