500|$|At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich {{appeared}} with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized {{the idea of}} using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's [...] "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just [...] "sharing" [...] by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was [...] "borrowing things that were <b>not</b> <b>yours</b> without asking". He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, [...] "I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own." [...] Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.|$|E
500|$|After {{landing at}} Toronto International Airport on May 3, 1969, Hendrix and Terry {{were the last}} to exit the plane. Ruffino was {{carrying}} Hendrix's bags, and he placed them on a counter at the customs station. An agent immediately chastised him, shouting: [...] "If that's <b>not</b> <b>yours,</b> keep your hands off it", to which Ruffino replied: [...] "I work for him." [...] The agent repeated the order before asking Hendrix if they were his bags; he confirmed that they were. At 9:30a.m., authorities detained Hendrix after finding {{a small amount of}} what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. A mobile lab was set up to determine what had been found, and at 1:30p.m. Metro police detective Harry Midgley arrested him for illegal possession of narcotics. After being booked and photographed, he was released on $10,000 bail and required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. [...] While they awaited the lab results, Stickells attempted to make contact with Hendrix's manager, Mike Jeffery, who had traveled to Hawaii and was unavailable.|$|E
500|$|The German {{invasion}} of Norway in 1940 led to Andersen's life once more taking a turn into illegal activities. His furniture workshop {{was used as}} a weapons depot by the Norwegian resistance movement, and he took part in looting German military stores. He was first arrested by the Germans after he had responded to rumours that he was a Nazi by writing the Norwegian national socialist party Nasjonal Samling's official publication Fritt Folk and stating that [...] "although I have done many wrong things in my life, a Nazi I am <b>not.</b> <b>Yours</b> sincerely Johs. S. Andersen". The letter was published unedited by the newspaper, although Andersen was later arrested by the occupying authorities and sentenced to one year in prison, after spending half a year in detention. Using techniques he had learned during his earlier criminal career, Andersen managed to be transferred to prison hospital during his time in detention. While there he acquired false x-ray images and tuberculosis germs to fake illnesses in other captured resistance men who {{were on their way to}} interrogation. He also infected a German interrogator with malaria by contaminating his insulin. At night, he would sneak out of the hospital and operate in Oslo, amongst other activities breaking into Nasjonal Samling offices and stealing documents, copying them and having them shipped to the United Kingdom together with evidence of torture in Nazi-run prisons. He served the last part of his sentence in Fuhlsbüttel near Hamburg, Germany. [...] His wife was also active in resistance work, dealing with propaganda and espionage. Author Egil Ulateig doubts the veracity of Andersen's prison exploits, which are based mostly on Andersen's own testimony.|$|E

2500|$|... "You {{have heard}} the order, and I must confess are in a pretty {{condition}} to obey it. I will have to return it with the endorsement upon the back that 'the First Maryland refuses to meet the enemy', despite being given orders by General Jackson. Before this day I was proud to call myself a Marylander, but now, God knows, I would rather be known as anything else. Shame on you to bring this stigma upon the fair name of your native state - to cause the finger of scorn to be pointed at those who confided to your keeping their most sacred trust - their honor {{and that of the}} glorious Old State. Marylanders you call yourselves - profane not that hallowed name again, for it is <b>not</b> <b>yours.</b> What Marylander ever before threw down his arms and deserted his colors {{in the presence of the}} enemy, and those arms, and those colors too, placed in your hands by a woman? Never before has one single blot defaced her honored history. Could it be possible to conceive a crime more atrocious, an outrage more damnable? Go home and publish to the world your infamy. Boast of it when you meet your fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and sweethearts. Tell them it was you who, when brought face to face with the enemy, proved yourselves recreants, and acknowledged yourselves to be cowards. Tell them this, and see if you are not spurned from their presence like some loathsome leper, and despised, detested, nay abhorred, by those whose confidence you have so shamefully betrayed; you will wander over the face of the earth with the brand of 'coward', 'traitor', indelibly imprinted on your foreheards, and in the end sink into a dishonored grave, unwept for, uncared for, leaving behind as a heritage to your posterity the scorn and contempt of every honest man and virtuous woman in the land." ...|$|E
