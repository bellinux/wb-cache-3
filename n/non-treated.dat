50|$|Matching is a {{statistical}} technique {{which is used}} to evaluate the effect of a treatment by comparing the treated and the <b>non-treated</b> units in an observational study or quasi-experiment (i.e. when the treatment is not randomly assigned). The goal of matching is, for every treated unit, to find one (or more) <b>non-treated</b> unit(s) with similar observable characteristics against whom the effect of the treatment can be assessed. By matching treated units to similar <b>non-treated</b> units, matching enables a comparison of outcomes among treated and <b>non-treated</b> units to estimate the effect of the treatment reducing bias due to confounding. Propensity score matching, an early matching technique, was developed as part of the Rubin causal model.|$|E

50|$|Paradoxically it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that oral administration of corticosteroids in this situation may lead to more recurrent attacks than in <b>non-treated</b> patients (though oral steroids are generally prescribed after the intravenous course, to wean the patient off the medication).

50|$|There are physical, chemical, and {{biological}} indicators {{that can be}} used to ensure that an autoclave reaches the correct temperature for the correct amount of time. If a <b>non-treated</b> or improperly treated item can be confused for a treated item, then there is the risk that they will become mixed up, which, in some areas such as surgery, is critical.|$|E

50|$|Nematodes avoid {{extremes}} of temperature. Morphine increases the latency of this defensive {{response in the}} parasitic Ascaris suum. In {{a study on the}} effects of opiates in Caenorhabditis elegans, 76% of a <b>non-treated</b> group exhibited a rapid, reflexive withdrawal to heat, whereas 47%, 36% and 39% of morphine, endomorphin 1 and endomorphin 2 treated worms (respectively) withdrew. These effects were reversed with the opioid receptor antagonists naloxone and CTOP, leading the authors to conclude that thermonocifensive behaviour in C. elegans was modulated by opioids.|$|E

5000|$|... 2. Alteration of {{regulatory}} T cell activity: Suppressing regulatory T cell activity following injury can allow a more robust autoimmune response to take place. For therapeutic purpose, the mere removal {{of regulatory}} T cells is, again, highly problematic because {{it increases the}} risk of inducing autoimmune diseases. Overcoming this limitation is possible using agents that transiently suppress regulatory T cell activity. Such an agent has been used successfully in an animal model of ischemic stroke, where treated animals exhibited improved neurological recovery relative to <b>non-treated</b> animals.|$|E

50|$|Mosquito nets {{treated with}} insecticides—known as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) or bednets—were {{developed}} in the 1980s for malaria prevention. ITNs {{are estimated to be}} twice as effective as untreated nets, and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net. These nets are dip-treated using a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide such as deltamethrin or permethrin which will double the protection over a <b>non-treated</b> net by killing and repelling mosquitoes. For maximum effectiveness, ITNs should be re-impregnated with insecticide every six months. This process poses a significant logistical problem in rural areas. Newer, long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have now replaced ITNs in most countries.|$|E
50|$|RNA-Seq is {{generally}} {{used to compare}} gene expression between conditions, such as a drug treatment vs <b>non-treated,</b> and find out which genes are up- or down-regulated in each condition. In principle, RNA-Seq {{will make it possible}} to account for all the transcripts in the cell for each condition. Differently expressed genes can be identified using tools that count the sequencing reads per gene and compare them between samples. Many packages are available for this type of analysis; some of the most commonly used tools are DESeq and edgeR, packages from Bioconductor. Both these tools use a model based on the negative binomial distribution.|$|E
5000|$|In {{industrial}} corona and plasma processes, cost-efficient {{and rapid}} analytical methods {{are required for}} confirming adequate surface functionality on a given substrate. Measuring the surface energy is an indirect method for confirming the presence of surface functional groups {{without the need for}} microscopy or spectroscopy, often expensive and demanding tools. Contact angle measurement (goniometry) can be used to find the surface energy of the treated and <b>non-treated</b> surface. Young's relation can be used to find surface energy assuming the simplification of experimental conditions to a three phase equilibrium (i.e. liquid drop applied to flat rigid solid surface in a controlled atmosphere), yielding ...|$|E
50|$|Atmospheric-pressure plasma {{treatment}} {{is very similar}} to corona treatment {{but there are a few}} differences between them. Both treatments may use one or more high voltage electrodes which charge the surrounding blown gas molecules and ionizes them. However in atmospheric plasma systems, the overall plasma density is much greater which enhances the rate and degree to which the ionized molecules are incorporated onto a materials' surface. An increased rate of ion bombardment occurs which may result in stronger material bonding traits depending on the gas molecules used in the process. Atmospheric {{plasma treatment}} technology also eliminates a possibility of treatment on a material's <b>non-treated</b> side; also known as backside treatment.|$|E
50|$|Nico-N was {{developed}} by South Korean scientist and professor Hyun-Won Kim of the University of Yonsei’s College of Medicine.Nico-N ingredients include Chinese quince, dried orange peel, mulberry leaf, green tea, ginkgo nut, liquorice root, apple, platycodon, lemon, celery and Chinese matrimony vine. Nico-N was treated {{in the form of}} chewing gum to 36 healthy male smokers with at least 2 years of smoking history. Urine analysis showed that cotinine concentration of smokers treated with Nico-N increased dose dependently compared to the <b>non-treated</b> control group. Cotinine, a nontoxic metabolite of nicotine, could be removed from the body in urine. Increase of the cotinine production from the smokers treated with Nico-N indicates the detoxification effect of Nico-N against nicotine.|$|E
50|$|BRs {{have also}} been {{reported}} to {{have a variety of}} effects when applied to rice seeds (Oryza sativa L.). Seeds treated with BRs were shown to reduce the growth inhibitory effect of salt stress. When the developed plants fresh weight was analyzed the treated seeds outperformed plants grown on saline and non-saline medium however when the dry weight was analyzed BR treated seeds only outperformed untreated plants that were grown on saline medium. When dealing with tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) under salt stress the concentration of cholophyll a and cholophyll b were decreased and thus pigmentation was decreased as well. BR treated rice seeds considerably restored the pigment level in plants that were grown on saline medium when compared to <b>non-treated</b> plants under the same conditions.|$|E

The building is a blend of modernist and traditional forms and materials. It was inspired by the form of traditional boat sheds, as well as the traditional barns of Oxfordshire. The building occupies a space of 2300 square meters, and is lifted above the ground on concrete pillars to avoid flooding. The exterior and parts of the interior are covered in planks of <b>non-treated</b> oak, matching the local rural architecture. The roofs and sunscreens are of stainless steel,The entrance has glass walls, and the galleries on the ground floor receive natural light through roof.|$|E

5000|$|The {{premise of}} his {{findings}} was a [...] "unique" [...] analysis showing over 70 trace minerals, which inspired Anderson to coin the name Azomite for his discovery - {{an acronym for}} the A to Z of minerals including trace elements. Selected by the U.S. Government to study nitrates in South America (1919-1925), Head had developed a theory that the benefits plants received from nitrates was actually from the minute quantities of trace elements which served as catalysts. The duo ground the ore into rock dust to see its effects in a controlled environment. Beginning with tomatoes and extending tests {{to a wide range}} of vegetables, they found the Azomite plots produced heartier plants that were also free from the worm infestation prevalent in the <b>non-treated</b> plots.|$|E
50|$|Breeding {{programs}} and genetic engineering are powerful methods for enhancing natural phytoremediation capabilities, or for introducing new capabilities into plants. Genes for phytoremediation may originate from a micro-organism {{or may be}} transferred from one plant to another variety better adapted to the environmental conditions at the cleanup site. For example, genes encoding a nitroreductase from a bacterium were inserted into tobacco and showed faster removal of TNT and enhanced resistance to the toxic effects of TNT.Researchers have also discovered a mechanism in plants {{that allows them to}} grow even when the pollution concentration in the soil is lethal for <b>non-treated</b> plants. Some natural, biodegradable compounds, such as exogenous polyamines, allow the plants to tolerate concentrations of pollutants 500 times higher than untreated plants, and to absorb more pollutants.|$|E
50|$|The use of 1-MCP {{to prevent}} fruit {{ripening}} came under scrutiny {{by the press}} during late 2005, when it was shown that the method is occasionally used to inhibit ripening of fruit {{by as much as}} a year, causing consumers to purchase year-old fruit without being aware of it. Fruits which have been treated with 1-MCP do not trigger any labelling regulations, and are allowed for use with certified organic foods, and are therefore non-distinguishable from <b>non-treated</b> products.In the United States the National Organic Program does not allow the use of 1-MCP on organic produce, however the only test devised by the United States Environmental Protection Agency; radioisolated analytical method is too expensive, though it can measure residues on fruit up to 90 days post treatment.

50|$|Miller and Sweatt {{demonstrated}} that rats trained in a contextual fear-conditioning paradigm had {{elevated levels of}} mRNA for DNMT3a and DNMT3b in the hippocampus. Fear conditioning is an associative memory task where a context, like a room, is paired with an aversive stimulus, like a foot shock; animals who have learned the association show higher levels of freezing behavior when exposed to the context {{even in the absence}} of the aversive stimulation. However, when rats were treated with the DNMT inhibitors zebularine or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine immediately after fear-conditioning, they demonstrated reduced learning (freezing behavior). When treated rats were re-trained 24 hours later, they performed as well as <b>non-treated</b> rats. Furthermore, it was shown that when these DNMT inhibitors were given 6 hours after training, and the rats were tested 24 hours later, the rats displayed normal fear memory, indicating that DNMTs are involved specifically in memory consolidation. These findings reveal the importance of dynamic changes in methylation status in memory formation.|$|E
5000|$|Estrogen, progesterone, and {{testosterone}} {{are naturally}} present in beef cattle. These hormones are {{also present in}} humans. Industry studies state that the contribution of estrogen, progesterone and testosterone from beef consumption is minuscule compared to the quantities produced naturally in the human body. By comparison, an adult male will produce 136,000 ng of estrogen on a given day; whereas the estrogen levels present in a 6-ounce serving of beef from a treated animal is only approximately 3.8 ng. In another word, a human being will produce almost 36,000 {{times the amount of}} estrogen in one day that would be present in a piece of beef produced with the growth hormones treated. Thus, current scientific evidence is insufficient to support the hypothesis that pubescent maturation is caused by the hormonal substance use in animals. [...] However, the differences between levels in treated and <b>non-treated</b> animals were deemed significant enough for the EU to ban imports of U.S. beef.|$|E
50|$|In a 2012 study, {{scientists}} {{found that an}} analyses of bees found dead in and around hives from several apiaries in Indiana showed {{the presence of the}} neonicotinoid insecticides clothianidin and thiamethoxam. The research showed that the insecticides were present at high concentrations in waste talc that was exhausted from farm machinery during planting and that is left outside after cleaning the planting equipment. Talc is used in the vacuum system planters to keep pesticide treated seeds flowing freely and was studied by the investigators since the waste talc can be picked up by the wind, and could spread the pesticide to <b>non-treated</b> areas; they did not however investigate whether and how much pesticide spreads this way. The insecticides were also consistently found at low levels in soil up to two years after treated seed was planted, and on nearby dandelion flowers and corn pollen gathered by the bees. Also in 2012, researchers in Italy published findings that the pneumatic drilling machines that plant corn seeds coated with clothianidin and imidacloprid release large amounts of the pesticide into the air, causing significant mortality in foraging honey bees.|$|E
50|$|The {{edges of}} the {{composition}} are predominantly <b>non-treated</b> and transparent, so that the surroundings are projected into the work itself. The transparency of glass allows him to express his thoughts and experiences in a single picture. The pictures are made with two or more panes in back of each other, but connected. Each single pane is distinctly fashioned and the final result of a unique impression. Connecting the panes into a single work {{makes it possible for}} Nabo Gass to unite his past experiences with the present and to confront them. Not until one views the work as a whole do the overlapping panes blend into an all-round impression, corresponding to a human sense of reality, because a reciprocity exists between the overlapping experienced impressions or sensations. Nabo Gass considers the conventional picture isolated in its own world. The glass picture, on the other hand, is an effort to come to an understanding with its surroundings. His pictures change according to their surroundings and light. Because the background is not entirely composed of the work itself, the composition is pulled into real space, becoming reality itself. This is in keeping with the theme of the artist’s work because they are taken from life, they are immanent.|$|E
40|$|Nootkatone, one of over 300 {{components}} of vetiver oil, is a mildly pungent sesquiterpene ketone with a distinctive grapefruit flavor, {{largely responsible for}} vetiver oil unique aroma. As part of our research on natural products efficacy against Formosan subterranean termite, previous experiments suggested that vetiver oil {{and some of its}} components acted as a repellant and toxicant to this pest. In order to better understand how nootkatone affects the behavior and physiology of these termites. Treatments consisted in: Sand treated with nootkatone and both slices of <b>non-treated</b> wood; <b>Non-treated</b> sand and both slices of nootkatone-treated wood; <b>Non-treated</b> sand, one slice of nootkatone-treated wood and one slice of <b>non-treated</b> wood; Control with <b>non-treated</b> sand and both slices of <b>non-treated</b> wood. Daily observations on the number of feeding termites on each wood slice, evaluations of tunneling behavior, weekly measurements of food consumption, variation in the number of different species of symbiont protozoa present over time and termite survival were recorded. Our results showed that exposure to nootkatone disrupt normal termite behavior, significantly affecting feeding ability and survival. Effects on the protozoa suggest that nootkatone may also act directly as a toxicant. For its negative effects on termite physiology and behavior, nootkatone may represent a promising natural alternative for termite control...|$|E

After excluding non-respondents and unavailable individuals, we ended up with a sample of 558 <b>non-treated</b> individuals. 16 This led us to a final sample of 859 individuals, including 301 participants and 558 non-participants.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{assessed}} {{the prevalence of}} Helicobacter pylori in symptomatic Bulgarian adults by means of culture, Gram's stain and an in-house rapid urease test (RUT), and also {{assessed the}} H. pylori density by culture. In total, 1441 <b>non-treated</b> and 270 treated patients were evaluated. Most <b>non-treated</b> patients with ulcers (87. 7 %), gastric malignancy (79. 2 %) and other gastroduodenal diseases (73. 4 %) were H. pylori-positive. Among <b>non-treated</b> and treated patients, 75. 3 % and 54. 8 %, respectively, of elderly patients, and 78. 3 % and 56. 1 %, respectively, of other adults were H. pylori-positive. Two (0. 1 %) <b>non-treated</b> adults were Helicobacter heilmannii-positive. The accuracy of direct Gram's stain and the in-house RUT were 74. 8 % and 64. 2 % in <b>non-treated</b> patients, and 73. 7 % and 63. 0 % in treated patients, respectively. Culture was highly accurate (> 95 %) in both groups. Older age decreased {{the sensitivity of the}} RUT in <b>non-treated</b> patients by 10. 7 % and that of all tests in treated patients by 6. 9 – 8. 1 %. Incubation for 11 days was required for the growth of 2 % and 4 % of the strains from treated patients on selective and non-selective medium, respectively. There were no differences in isolation rates between positive fresh (74. 2 %) and frozen (75. 2 %) specimens. In <b>non-treated</b> adults, a high H. pylori density (growth in all quadrants of the plates) was more common (43. 1 %) in ulcer patients than in other patients (25. 4 %). In conclusion, H. pylori infection was common in Bulgarian patients, and at a high density in > 40 % of ulcer patients, while H. heilmannii infection was uncommon. Culture provided a highly accurate diagnostic approach. Stomach biopsies from <b>non-treated</b> patients can be frozen for several days. The benefit of reporting H. pylori density, as determined by culture, requires further evaluation...|$|E
