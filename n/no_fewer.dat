40|$|Two cross-modal priming {{experiments}} investigated whether speech segmentation {{is based}} on the occurrence of strong syllables (A. Cutler & D. Norris, 1988) or lexical competition (J. L. McClelland & J. L. Elman, 1986). Auditorily presented words with <b>no,</b> <b>few,</b> or many competitors served as prime for a visual target. Facilitatory effects were larger for primes with <b>no</b> or <b>few</b> competitors than for primes withmany competitors. This difference disappeared when the interstimulus interval between the prime and target was shortened. The differential priming effects are interpreted as evidence for inhibition between competing lexical candidates. © 1995 American Psychological Association.

The most prolific natural predators of adult mallards are red foxes (which most often pick off brooding females) and the faster or larger birds of prey, i.e. peregrine falcons, Aquila eagles, or Haliaeetus eagles. In North America, adult mallards face <b>no</b> <b>fewer</b> than 15 species of birds of prey, from northern harriers and short-eared owls (both smaller than a mallard) to huge bald and golden eagles, and about a dozen species of mammalian predator, not counting several more avian and mammalian predators who threaten eggs and nestlings.|$|E

5|$|The disproportion was {{so great}} at parting, {{that it was almost}} impossible, in Drury Lane, to muster up a {{sufficient}} number to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of necessity be damned, that had not extraordinary favour from the audience. <b>No</b> <b>fewer</b> than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and vigour of the stage; they who were left being for the most part learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause for}} the {{extinction}} of the King Island emu is unknown. Soon after the bird was discovered, sealers settled on the island because of the abundance of elephant seals. Péron's interview with Daniel Cooper suggested that they likely contributed {{to the demise of}} the bird by hunting it, and perhaps by starting fires. Péron described how dogs were purpose-trained to hunt down the emus; Cooper even claimed to have killed <b>no</b> <b>fewer</b> than 300 emus himself. Cooper had been on the island for six months, which suggests he killed 50 birds a month. His group of sealers consisted of eleven men as well as his wife, and they alone may have killed 3,600 emus by the time Péron visited them.|$|E
5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack of}} sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) <b>no</b> <b>fewer</b> that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E
5000|$|Opponents {{to the car}} {{property}} tax argue, that common cars already pay 100% tariff when imported, meaning that a car in Costa Rica is twice as expensive as {{in the country of}} origin. Additionally, gas refills include 65% fuel tax. Owning a $7,500.00 car (U.S. price) for 7 years, can make the user pay up to $29,595.00 in total taxes (around $4,227.85 a year).

5|$|Time is also {{connected}} {{to the theme of}} light and dark. In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create the illusion of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, <b>no</b> <b>fewer</b> than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the illusion of its passage.|$|E
