50|$|The {{colour screen}} plate was usually {{sold as a}} {{separate}} item to the panchromatic <b>negatives.</b> A single colour screen plate could be placed into the camera and used to expose many <b>negatives</b> in succession.

30|$|Errors of S 3 {{come from}} false positives and false <b>negatives.</b> S 3 seeks to achieve higher {{performance}} than prior work by reducing false positives and false <b>negatives.</b> However, {{to choose the}} optimal threshold in the trade-off of false positives and false <b>negatives,</b> we seek less false <b>negatives</b> than false positives. This is because false positives identify normal data as sensitive, and thus cause over protection, while false <b>negatives</b> leave sensitive data unprotected, and cause more serious consequences, e.g., data exposed to attackers. In statistics, Recall can reflect the measure of false <b>negatives</b> and Precision reflects false positives. Therefore we seek higher recall value than precision value in this paper.|$|R
5|$|Financially unsuccessful, Tank Girl recouped {{only about}} $6 {{million of its}} $25 million budget {{at the box office}} and {{received}} mixed to <b>negative</b> reviews from critics. Martin and Hewlett have since spoken negatively of their experiences creating the film. Talalay blamed some of the film's <b>negative</b> reception on studio edits over which she had no control. Despite the <b>negative</b> critical reception and box office failure of the film, it has been cited {{as an example of a}} comic book film with a cult following, and it is noted for its feminist themes.|$|E

5|$|<b>Negative</b> {{symptoms}} are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes, {{and are less}} responsive to medication. They commonly include flat expressions or little emotion, poverty of speech, inability to experience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and lack of motivation. <b>Negative</b> symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life, functional ability, and the burden on others than positive symptoms do. People with greater <b>negative</b> symptoms often {{have a history of}} poor adjustment before the onset of illness, and response to medication is often limited.|$|E
5|$|One of the Han's {{greatest}} mathematical advancements was the world's {{first use}} of <b>negative</b> numbers. <b>Negative</b> numbers {{first appeared in the}} Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art as black counting rods, where positive numbers were represented by red counting rods. <b>Negative</b> numbers were also used by the Greek mathematician Diophantus around 275 AD, and in the 7th-century AD Bakhshali manuscript of Gandhara, South Asia, but were not widely accepted in Europe until the 16th century AD.|$|E

5|$|These designs, {{such as the}} Python Lowracer, a recumbent, {{usually have}} very lax head angles (40° to 65°) and {{positive}} or even <b>negative</b> trail.

25|$|Temperatures {{that are}} {{expressed}} as <b>negative</b> {{numbers on the}} familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain systems can achieve truly <b>negative</b> temperatures; that is, their thermodynamic temperature (expressed in kelvins) can be of a <b>negative</b> quantity. A system with a truly <b>negative</b> temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a <b>negative</b> temperature is hotter than any system with a positive temperature, {{in the sense that}} if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the <b>negative</b> to the positive-temperature system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Negative</b> network externalities, in the {{mathematical}} sense, {{are those that}} have a <b>negative</b> effect compared to normal (positive) network effects.

In nature, <b>negative</b> network externalities are the forces that pull towards equilibrium, are responsible for stability, and are the physical limitations preventing states from reaching infinity.|$|E
