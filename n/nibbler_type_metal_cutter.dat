Local plastic deformation occurs in the edge layer avoiding the formation of tears within the edge layer of the treated partial region of the cutter. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a drill with a hard <b>metal</b> <b>cutter.</b> Preferred Features: The non sharp-edged tools are hammers, nails or rollers. The hard <b>metal</b> <b>cutter</b> is formed as a hard metal crown. USE - Method {{for increasing}} the fraction toughness of the edge layer of a hard <b>metal</b> <b>cutter</b> of a drill for percussive drilling of rock and concrete. ADVANTAGE - The fraction toughness of the edge layer of a hard <b>metal</b> <b>cutter</b> of a drill is significantly increased...|$|R

These have character shapes cut into them, so the result is a cast slug with the character shapes of the line on its front face. The mold disk is sometimes water-cooled, and often air-cooled with a blower, to carry away the heat of the molten <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> and allow the cast slugs to solidify quickly.|$|R

5000|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} to the mid-1990s, Stella created {{a large body}} of work that responded in a general way to Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick. During this time, the {{increasingly}} deep relief of Stella’s paintings gave way to full three-dimensionality, with sculptural forms derived from cones, pillars, French curves, waves, and decorative architectural elements. To create these works, the artist used collages or maquettes that were then enlarged and re-created with the aids of assistants, industrial <b>metal</b> <b>cutters,</b> and digital technologies. [...] La scienza della pigrizia (The Science of Laziness), from 1984, is an example of Stella's transition from two-dimensionality to three-dimensionality. It is fabricated from oil paint, enamel paint, and alkyd paint on canvas, etched magnesium, aluminum and fiberglass.|$|R

5000|$|Casting: The matrix is {{inserted}} {{into the bottom of}} a device called a hand mould. The mould is clamped shut and molten <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> alloy consisting mostly of lead and tin, {{with a small amount of}} antimony for hardening, is poured into a cavity from the top. Antimony has the rare property of expanding as it cools, giving the casting sharp edges. When the <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> has sufficiently cooled, the mould is unlocked and a rectangular block approximately 4 centimeters long, called a sort, is extracted. Excess casting on the end of the sort, called the tang, is later removed to make the sort the precise height required for printing, known as [...] "type height".|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{have been}} {{performing}} research on a Totalized Hydrogen Energy Utilization System (THEUS) which {{is composed of}} a Unitized Reversible Fuel Cell (URFC) and metal hydride tanks. THEUS {{is very similar to}} the regenerative fuel cell system located at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) but it utilizes the thermal energy from the system to improve the total system efficiency. AIST and SRNL started a collaborative research program on THEUS in 2010 under the Clean Energy Partnership Technology Program between METI and DOE. To initiate the project, a horizontal <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> hydride tank was developed. It had a double coil type heat exchanger and contained 50 kg of AB 5 <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> hydride alloy. Absorption and desorption of 6, 350 NL of hydrogen was successfully attained at an absorption rate of 11. 8 NL/min and a desorption rate of 8. 1 NL/min. The experimental results of the heat exchanging performance were compared with the results of a vertical <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> hydride tank which was developed in AIST in 2008.
