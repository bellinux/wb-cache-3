5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed {{the gender gap}} in life expectancy and now live longer than men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the <b>necessities</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E

In addition to gender inequity, there remain specific disease processes uniquely associated with being a woman which create specific challenges in both prevention and health care.|$|E

The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.|$|E

The data collected through the questionnaire was analyzed using descriptive statistics like frequencies and percentages. The result shows that 65 % of the respondents accepted that lack of entrepreneurship skills among youth is responsible for the high rate of poverty in Nigeria. The result also revealed that at least 60 % of the people that benefitted from the skill acquisition programme can now afford the basic <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> The study therefore recommended that since most of the people that benefited from the programme could afford the basic <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> the government should begin to think of the way of developing the programme to the status of poverty eradication programme...|$|R

25|$|The {{differences}} between alternative views of economic freedom have been {{expressed in terms}} of Isaiah Berlin's distinction between positive freedom and negative freedom. Classical liberals favour a focus on negative freedom as did Berlin himself. By contrast Amartya Sen argues for an understanding of freedom in terms of capabilities to pursue a range of goals. One measure which attempts to assess freedom in the positive sense is Goodin, Rice, Parpo, and Eriksson's measure of discretionary time, which is an estimate of how much time people have at their disposal during which they are free to choose the activities in which they participate, after taking into account the time they need to spend acquiring the <b>necessities</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> In his book, Capitalism and Freedom, Milton Friedman explains the preservation of freedom is the reason for limited and decentralized governments. It creates positive freedom within the society allowing for freedom of choice for an individual in a free society.|$|E

It had, at first, no commercial values—it may have been that its first beginnings in its staple wool trade sprang from the wool growing of the Cistercians at Kirkstall Abbey, on its western borders. The township was concerned {{with little more than}} agriculture, and such trade as it knew was confined to those retailings which establish themselves wherever communities spring up—dealings in the <b>necessities</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> which, reduced to a minimum, are merely food and clothing. The town itself was small—it was probably confined within a triangle formed on the lines of the present lower Briggate, Kirkgate, and the River Aire, with the parish church at one angle somewhere about, perhaps on, the site of the modern one. The streets would be narrow, unpaved and unlighted. The houses, {{in spite of the fact}} that stone is so plentiful in the district, were of wood, whitewashed, in many cases, thatched. All around the town lay the open fields and meadows, cultivated on the principle of strip-farming. And beyond these lay the forest of Elmet.|$|E
