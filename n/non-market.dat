Finally, we indicate that the set of the no-arbitrage prices for a <b>non-marketed</b> contingent claim is the interval of the real numbers whose supremum and infimum is the seller's and the buyer's price of the claim, respectively.

The primary data from 184 agro-pastoralist households were collected using a structured questionnaire. Data collected comprised information relating to household demographic, household livelihoods and <b>non-marketed</b> benefits of cattle. The result showed that the probability of household willingness to pay (WTP) was influenced by both animal and household related characteristics. Animal related characteristics that had a significant influence on the probability of households WTP for NMB’s of cattle included: Animal age (ANAGE), herd size (HERDSIZE) and cattle breeds (INDBRED). Household related characteristics that had significant (p< 0. 05) influence on probability of household WTP for NMB’s of cattle, comprised: Dependant ratio (DEPRAT), household size (HHS), off-farm income (OFFINC) and distance to the market (DISTMK). As expected, however, the OFFINC had a negative influence on probability of household WTP for NMB’s of cattle.

30|$|Statistical {{analyses}} and studies revealed that one factor associated with water shortages and reduced water quality {{is high and}} inappropriate consumption of water. High consumption of water {{may be due to}} its low price or lack of knowledge about its true economic value. Many studies carried out by scholars using different methods to evaluate water economic value (Torell et al. 1990; Young 1996; Tarimo et al. 1998; Faux and Perry 1999; Doppler et al. 2002; Abu-Madi 2009). Among pricing methods, this is the appropriate valuation of water which, as a classic <b>non-marketed</b> resource, can seldom be assigned a justified market price (even for commodity use). Therefore, in most cases, an indirect, a <b>non-marketed</b> method is employed to calculate an accurate figure for the value of water (Young 1996).|$|R

25|$|Health care {{prices in}} the United States {{describes}} market and <b>non-market</b> factors that determine pricing, along with possible causes as to why prices are higher than other countries. Compared to other OECD countries, U.S. healthcare costs are one-third higher or more relative {{to the size of}} the economy (GDP). According to the CDC, during 2015 health expenditures per-person were nearly $10,000 on average, with total expenditures of $3.2 trillion or 17.8% GDP. Proximate reasons for the differences with other countries include higher prices for the same services (i.e., higher price per unit) and greater use of healthcare (i.e., more units consumed). Higher administrative costs, higher per-capita income, and less government intervention to drive down prices are deeper causes. While the annual inflation rate in healthcare costs has declined in recent decades, it still remains above the rate of economic growth, resulting in a steady increase in healthcare expenditures relative to GDP from 6% in 1970 to nearly 18% in 2015.|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} new {{approach}} for assessing the cost of marginal ecosystem changes {{and the effectiveness of}} agri-environmental schemes. The approach is based on a theoretical and empirical analysis of the bio-economic production interactions between marketed outputs and <b>non-marketed</b> ecosystem services at the micro level. To frame the economic nature of the problem, we employ a generalized joint production model in combination with cost minimization. The generalized joint production framework allows for the consideration of complementary, substitutive and competitive relationships between agricultural production and <b>non-marketed</b> ecosystem services generation and avoids double counting. From this theoretical model we distinguish three theoretical cases depending on the imposed minimum acceptable level of the <b>non-marketed</b> ecosystem services. We employ farm level panel data for the UK to empirically investigate these cases. More specifically, to represent and evaluate the production structure, we estimate first- and second-order elasticities derived from a flexible transformation function. Results show that the majority of farms produce agricultural output and ecosystem services in a complementary relationship. Generation of multiple ecosystem services on the same farm showed either a substitutive or competitive relationship. A change in the composition of the ecosystem services output would have very different implications for individual farms. agri-environmental services, bio-economic modelling, economies of scale and scope, Agricultural and Food Policy, Environmental Economics and Policy, Q 18, Q 57, Q 58.,...|$|R

25|$|In October 1987 the Guildford branch {{circulated}} {{an internal}} discussion document {{arguing that the}} growing socialist movement would have a profound economic impact on the operation of capitalism before {{the overthrow of the}} capitalist class and the formal establishment of socialism. They claimed that socialists would use their influence politically (through the legislature and local councils) to adjust patterns of state income and expenditure in ‘socialistic’ directions, including the provision of free services. Drawing inspiration from writers like André Gorz, they also claimed that socialists would be encouraging the growth of the non-monetary, voluntary sector of the economy and should be instrumental in developing support networks for co-operatives and LETS schemes. This critique of the Party's revolutionary strategy was vigorously rebutted in other circulars from branches and members and at Party conference. A small number of proponents of the Guildford perspective resigned. They went on to publish the journal Spanner, so-called because it aimed to ‘span’ opinion across the <b>non-market</b> socialist sector of political thought, and in recent years some have been instrumental in founding the small World In Common group.|$|E

This stands in sharp contrast to neoclassical economics where those forms of labor are unaccounted for as [...] "non-economic" [...] phenomena.

A related argument is that the market [...] "accepts existing sex/gender divisions of labor and pay inequalities as normal and unproblematic. With this basic assumption underlying their calculations, the valuations produced serve to reinforce gender inequalities rather than challenge women's subordination." ...|$|E

2500|$|Marshall Sahlins has {{emphasized}} that <b>non-market</b> exchange is constrained by social relationships.

These social relationships are largely kinship based. His discussion of types of reciprocity is located within what he calls the [...] "domestic mode of production." [...] His typology of reciprocity thus refers to [...] "cultures lacking a political state, and it applies only insofar as economy and social relations have not been modified by the historic penetration of states." [...] Paul Sillitoe has extended the analysis of reciprocity in these conditions, arguing that the type of reciprocity found will depend upon which sphere of production is being examined. The production of subsistence goods is under the control of domestic units and hence marked by generalized reciprocity. Wealth objects – by their nature from outside – are competitively exchanged to acquire status, but no one is able to control their production and hence centralize power.|$|E
