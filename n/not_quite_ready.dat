The {{following}} year, he organized a new Brazil Line with another investor, and built three new passenger freighters for it - Advance and Finance, both of 2,600 tons, and the 2,985-ton Allianca. The new Brazil Line would struggle {{on for a}} number of years without ever making a profit, before finally failing in 1893.|$|E
25|$|Dual {{registration}} {{refers to}} an arrangement between clubs whereby a player continues to be registered to his current Super League club and is also registered {{to play for a}} club in the Championship.

25|$|In {{the history}} of LGBT theatre in Singapore, {{it was only in}} the second half of the 1980s that gay writers started to explore the {{hitherto}} taboo area of homosexuality in their works. The licensing authority, however, was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> so that in 1988, three plays with gay themes were banned from being performed. These were Eleanor Wong's Jackson on a Jaunt, Chay Yew's As If He Hears and Russell Heng's Lest The Demons Get To Me. The first two plays were subsequently staged in 1989/1990 after negotiations with the authority. The third was staged in 1992 after Singapore's culture policy was liberalised by its new Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong.|$|E

[...] In {{an unusual}} move, {{he was taken}} {{directly}} from his maiden race to the Grade I Santa Anita Derby, where he had a troubled start and ran in sixth place before finishing fourth, [...] lengths behind the winner. [...] Viewed as <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> for the Triple Crown races, Paynter next ran in the Derby Trial, where, on a muddy track, he lost narrowly in the final furlong. In his first three races, he was ridden by Martin Garcia. [...] His second win was in a [...] mile allowance race on the undercard of the 2012 Preakness Stakes, when he was ridden by [...] Mike Smith, who also rode Bodemeister in the Preakness later that day. Following Bodemeister's second-place finish in both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, Paynter was entered into the Belmont with Smith as jockey.|$|E

I’m still a JAM shipper all the way, but it’s nice to see Jim smile again." [...] Skerry concluded that [...] "there were some seriously funny, laugh out loud moments tonight, but I don’t think this episode {{is going to make}} my favorites list. But even when The Office isn’t at its best, it’s still hands down the best comedy on TV." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A-. In the audio commentary, Wilson noted that [...] "The Coup" [...] is [...] "not a fan favorite," [...] though it was submitted for an Emmy Award. For his work on this episode, Paul Lieberstein was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Comedy.|$|E

According to Moreau, {{he was sent}} to do such shots when the crew was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> to shoot a scene. [...] These time-lapse sequences were often accompanied by the film's melancholic score, suggesting the passage of time and contributing to the uneasiness that builds up to the inevitable yet unsettling climax.|$|E

2500|$|This {{aircraft}} was tested at Eastchurch airfield on the Isle of Sheppey in June 1911, flown by Dunne. [...] Designated the Dunne D.7 or D.7 Auto Safety.

It first appeared, <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> for flight, at the Olympia Aero Show in March 1911 and was on test at Eastchurch that June. Dunne was pleased with the improved performance. [...] In January 1912 Dunne demonstrated the D.7 to members of the Royal Aeronautical Society, writing a note whilst flying hands off at 60mph.|$|E

It's light years ahead of my last album. We're demoing new songs right now, as we speak, and I'm telling you, people are seriously gonna lose their mind." [...] During the band's performance at Dirt Fest 2012 in Birch Run Michigan, Radke announced to the crowd that it would be the group's last show before returning to the studio for the band's second album. Ronnie also said in an interview that the band would be in the studio late 2012 with demos already and hoping for an early 2013 release. In issue number 1442 of Kerrang!

50|$|After {{capturing}} the Akpınar-Kovalca line, Greeks stopped {{the attack and}} dug in. Upon observing the Turkish positions being reinforced with the 61. division, they realized that the Turks were determined to hold there and not fall back any further. <b>Not</b> feeling <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> to withstand on the battlefield, the Greeks vacated the İnönü vicinity and pulled back on January 11.

Miles and his friend Armstrong sat long talking over their fate--which they {{mutually}} agreed was a very sad one; but at last, overcome by exhaustion, if not anxiety, they sank into much-needed repose, and the only sound that broke the stillness of the night was the tread of the Arab sentinel as he paced slowly to and fro.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Australian wine {{industry}} was interested in the idea of sealing wines with the Stelvin screw-cap, consumers did not agree. Because consumers saw the use of a metallic cap as an indication of an inferior product, the winery stopped using the Stelvin screw-cap in 1984. [...] Pewsey Vale never fully gave up on the idea, and reintroduced the Stelvin in 1995 for their riesling wines intended for museum use. [...] In 2000, current winemaker Louisa Rosa was quoted as saying: Pewsey Vale Rieslings are renowned for their exceptional aging ability. While Australian wine consumers may <b>not</b> be <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> to go back to Pewsey Vale in Stelvin, at least we can rest assured that the aging potential of these (museum) wines will be maximised.|$|R

60|$|The brothers, therefore, having each {{expressed}} his preference {{in respect to}} {{the best place for}} the city, were equally unwilling to recede from the ground which they had taken. Remus thought that there was no reason why he should yield to Romulus, and Romulus was equally unwilling to give way to Remus. Neither could yield, in fact, without in some sense admitting the superiority of the other. The respective partisans of the two leaders began to take sides, and the dissension threatened to become a serious quarrel. Finally, being <b>not</b> yet <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> for an open rupture, they concluded to refer the question to Numitor, and to abide by his decision. They expected that he would come and view the ground, and so decide where it was best that the city should be built, and thus terminate the controversy.|$|R

6000|$|But Mr. Swinburne is {{not always}} riding the {{whirlwind}} and calling out of {{the depths of the}} sea. Romantic ballads in Border dialect have not lost their fascination for him, and this last volume contains some very splendid examples of this curious artificial kind of poetry. The amount of pleasure one gets out of dialect is a matter entirely of temperament. To say ‘mither’ instead of ‘mother’ seems to many the acme of romance. There are others who are <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> so <b>ready</b> to believe in the pathos of provincialism. There is, however, no doubt of Mr. Swinburne’s mastery over the form, whether the form be <b>quite</b> legitimate or <b>not.</b> The Weary Wedding has the concentration and colour of a great drama, and the quaintness of its style lends it something of the power of a grotesque. The ballad of The Witch-Mother, a mediæval Medea who slays her children because her lord is faithless, is worth reading on account of its horrible simplicity.
