5|$|After Meredith is {{promoted}} to a resident, her younger half-sister Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) begins working at Seattle Grace as an intern. Meredith initially rejects Lexie's attempts {{to form a}} relationship, but slowly softens towards her. The sisters are very different people with different childhoods. Lexie had an idealistic family life and often has difficulty understanding her much darker sister, who does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> positive associations with family as Lexie.|$|E

5|$|The {{cohesive}} forces among liquid molecules {{are responsible}} for the phenomenon of surface tension. In the bulk of the liquid, each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules, resulting in a net force of zero. The molecules at the surface do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> molecules on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inwards. This creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to the minimal area.|$|E
5|$|Australian Prime Minister John Curtin officially {{announced}} {{the loss of}} the cruiser during the afternoon of 30 November. Sydneys destruction was a major blow to Australian morale and military capability: her ship's company made up 35% of the RAN's wartime casualties. The cruiser's loss did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> impact internationally; two British capital ships were destroyed during the same fortnight, and Japan entered World War II with attacks on Pearl Harbor and Singapore three weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Burns and Rigby {{found several}} prototiles, {{including}} the Koch snowflake, {{that may be}} used to tile the plane only by using copies of the prototile in two or more different sizes. An earlier paper by Danzer, Grünbaum, and Shephard provides another example, a convex pentagon that tiles the plane only when combined in two sizes. Although the Pythagorean tiling uses two different sizes of squares, the square does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> property as these prototiles of only tiling by similarity, because it also is possible to tile the plane using only squares of a single size.|$|E

5|$|Most of Tender Mercies {{was filmed}} in Waxahachie and Palmer, two towns in Ellis County in north central Texas. Beresford largely avoided the Victorian {{architecture}} and other picturesque elements of Waxahachie and instead focused on relatively barren locations more characteristic of West Texas. The town {{portrayed in the}} film is never identified by name. Foote said when he wrote the script he did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> isolated and lonely vision for the setting Beresford did, but he felt the atmosphere the director captured served the story well.|$|E
5|$|Having {{reached his}} zenith, Berry did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{statistical}} success over his final seven seasons, but he remained a consistent target for Unitas. His 75 receptions in the 1961 season was second {{most in the}} league, and he finished 10th in receiving yards, but failed to record a touchdown {{for the first time}} since his rookie year. He scored the first touchdown of that year's Pro Bowl on a 16-yard reception from Unitas in the first quarter. His streak of Pro Bowl invitations ended at four, as he was not invited in 1962, but made consecutive Pro Bowl appearances in 1963 and 1964, the latter being his final. The Colts returned to the postseason in 1964, where they were shutout 27–0 by the Cleveland Browns in the 1964 championship game.|$|E
5|$|Lynette grows {{increasingly}} weary at {{the idea}} of having more children. She confesses to Tom that while she began loving her other children before they were born, she does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> feelings for her unborn twins. Tom assures her that she will love them once she is able to hold them in her arms. At Lynette's request, the couple conceals the pregnancy from their family and friends. Meanwhile, Gabrielle is irritated with Ana's poor attitude, provocative wardrobe, and disregard for her curfew or other rules. Carlos insists that Gabrielle sign a contract that would make her Ana's legal guardian, but she refuses. However, when Ana expresses interest in becoming a model, Gabrielle understands that they are more alike than she initially thought and signs the guardianship documents.|$|E

50|$|While Eleanor Coppola <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> lengthy film {{career as}} her husband and children, she was a {{constant}} presence on films directed by her famous family members.

50|$|Unfortunately, {{this is a}} calculation-intensive and {{critical}} process that is largely unsupported by MRP/ERP systems. The lack of system tools and clash with conventional MRP planning routine are primary reason why demand-based management <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> level of adoption experienced {{by the rest of}} the DFT principles.|$|R
5|$|Municipalities {{have the}} right to decentralize {{themselves}} and form submunicipalities as an additional level of government. This right and the submunicipalities will cease to exist in the near future {{to reduce the number of}} levels of government. Only Amsterdam, where the districts are called stadsdelen, and Rotterdam, where the districts are called deelgemeenten, consist of such formal subdivisions. The Hague, Almere, Breda, Eindhoven, Enschede, Groningen, Nijmegen and Utrecht have instituted stadsdelen as well, although they do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> legal submunicipal status. For administrative use by municipalities and data collection by Statistics Netherlands all municipalities are subdivided into districts (wijken), which in turn are subdivided into neighbourhoods (buurten). These subdivisions have, in contrast to the submunicipalities, no formal status. , the municipalities in the Netherlands were subdivided into 2,621 districts and 11,896 neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|Romanticism {{reached its}} apogee between the late 1850s {{and the early}} 1870s as it divided into several branches, {{including}} Indianism and sentimentalism. The most influential literary style in 19th-century Brazil, {{many of the most}} renowned Brazilian writers were exponents of Romanticism: Manuel de Araújo Porto Alegre, Gonçalves Dias, Gonçalves de Magalhães, José de Alencar, Bernardo Guimarães, Álvares de Azevedo, Casimiro de Abreu, Castro Alves, Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, Manuel Antônio de Almeida and Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay. In theater, the most famous Romanticist playwrights were Martins Pena and Joaquim Manuel de Macedo. Brazilian Romanticism did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> success in theater as it had in literature, as most of the plays were either Neoclassic tragedies or Romantic works from Portugal or translations from Italian, French or Spanish. After the opening of the Brazilian Dramatic Conservatory in 1845, the government gave financial aid to national theater companies in exchange for staging plays in Portuguese.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately decided {{under the}} title O'Grady v. Superior Court, the suit filed by Apple against unnamed bloggers raised the issue {{for the first time}} of whether bloggers hold the same protections against {{revealing}} sources that journalists have. In November 2004, three popular weblog sites featuring Apple rumors publicly revealed information about two unreleased Apple products, the Mac mini and an as yet unreleased product code-named Asteroid, also known as Project Q97. Apple subpoenaed three sites to force them to identify their confidential sources: Apple Insider, Power Page, and, separately, Think Secret, which did no original reporting on the case and thus had no sources to reveal. In February 2005, a trial court in California decided that website operators do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> shield law protection as do other journalists. The journalists appealed and, in May 2006, the California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's decision, ruling that activities in question were covered by the shield law.|$|E
