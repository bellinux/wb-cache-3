40|$|In {{the modern}} {{commercial}} world guarantees {{have become an}} important instrument. Guarantees {{are not limited to}} those given by a bank in the commercial world. Guarantees may also be issued by a parent company on behalf of a subsidiary, or by an individual(s) in personal transactions. The question then is what is a contract of guarantee? A guarantee is an assurance or security issued by one party (the guarantor) {{at the request of the}} party with the liability (the principal) to the party the liability is owed to (the beneficiary). Guarantees are discussed in this paper in the context of bank issued guarantees in <b>shipbuilding</b> <b>contract.</b> In <b>shipbuilding</b> <b>contracts</b> there are two types of guarantees issued – (i) refund guarantees, and (ii) payment guarantees. When payment is due under a guarantee, irrespective of if it is a refund guarantee or a payment guarantee, is dependent upon if it is a traditional guarantee type, or an on-demand bond type. The aim of this thesis is to examine the distinction between the true guarantee type and the on-demand bond type under English law. At the same time the objective of this thesis is to analyse the legal literature and the English common law cases to understand how a refund guarantee issued in <b>shipbuilding</b> <b>contracts</b> is conceived by the English courts to be either an on-demand bond or true guarantee. What are true guarantees and on-demand bonds? What are the distinguishing characteristics of each type of guarantee...|$|R
