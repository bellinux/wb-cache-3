Reflecting deranged homeostasis in cancer cells, most transformed or cancerous cells show aberrant gap junctional intercellular communication; they have decreased junctional communication between each other and/or with surrounding normal cells. Studies with in vitro cell transformation and animal carcinogenesis models suggest an involvement of blocked intercellular communication in later stages of carcinogenesis.

Due to the clear physical meaning of FLC, {{the influence of the}} phase lags between the system input and output can be reduced by the phase compensation method. Therefore, more frequency components can be employed in FLC and the control performance will be greatly improved.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} an output feedback {{learning control}} {{for a class}} of uncertain nonlinear systems with flexible components. The distinct time delay caused by system flexibility leads to the phase lag phenomenon and low system bandwidth. Therefore, the tracking problem of such systems is very difficult and challenging. To improve the tracking performance of such systems, an iterative learning control scheme using the Fourier neural network (FNN) is presented in this paper. This scheme uses only local output information for feedback. FNN employs orthogonal complex Fourier exponentials as its activation functions and the physical meaning of its hidden-layer neurons is clear. The FNN-based learning controller introduced here relies on the frequency-domain method, which converts the tracking problem in the time domain into a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> problems in the frequency domain. A novel phase compensation method is introduced {{to deal with the}} phase lag phenomenon, so that the bandwidth of the closed-loop system is increased.

40|$|A new {{iterative}} {{learning control}} approach based on Fourier neural network (FNN) is presented for the tracking {{control of a}} class of nonlinear systems with deterministic uncertainties. The proposed controller consists of two loops. The inner loop is a feedback control action that decreases system variability and reduces the influence of random disturbances. The outer loop is an FNN-based learning controller that generates the system input to suppress the error caused by system nonlinearities and deterministic uncertainties. The FNN employs orthogonal complex Fourier exponentials as its activation functions. Therefore, it is essentially a frequency-domain method that converts the tracking problem in the time domain into a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> problems in the frequency domain. Through a novel phase compensation technique, this model-free method {{makes it possible to}} use higher-frequency components in the FNN to improve the tracking performance. In addition, the structure of the FNN can be reconfigured according to the system output information to make the learning more efficient and increase the convergent speed of the tracking error. Experiments on both a commercial gear box and a belt-driven positioning table are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the level of relevance of the economic development and the level of pollution of thirteen states that joined the European Union (EU) in the last three enlargement rounds (2004, 2007, and 2013), with the length of transitional periods, i. e. the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulations</b> that have agreed transitional periods. The initial assumption is that the level of economic development of countries joining the EU and the level of pollution are affecting the length of transitional periods and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulations</b> that are agreed upon transitional periods. Accordingly, the paper points to the level of economic development (measured by GDP) and the level of pollution (emissions measured by CO 2 /pc and CO 2 /gdp). All the states are grouped into five regional groups (Mediterranean, Central Europe, the Baltics, South-East Europe and the member states of the former Yugoslavia).

40|$|In {{a socialist}} {{enterprise}} managed in a non-parametric and a non-instructive manner, the regulation system appears {{also in a}} parametric manner. They are composed, according to A.

The first element of ithese junctions are usually analyses, i. e. labour indices or regulators of supply equipped in certain patterns (the reference bases). Great difficulties arise {{in the selection of}} these bases, as each kind, apart from a positive effect has a negative effect, {{from the point of view}} of Centrum, on the strategy and tactics of socialist enterprises. In the light of an analysis of the types of bases in application, it has been postulated that instead of the analysers in the regulation junctions, synthetic recorder should be introduced. Such a recorder does not possess a pattern. However as the synthetic recorders are a resultant dimension (takings minus costs), their absolute dimension permits evaluation of the activity of the enterprise. The conjunction of moral and material appreciation got managers and the personnel of the enterprise, plus the size of the Company's fund with the synthetic recorder, should allow the construction of a regulating system whose activities are not contrary to the Centrum preferences. The effective influence of such a system depends on the fulfilling of a number of conditions, discussed in this work.

40|$|Ubiquitin is {{a highly}} conserved protein {{involved}} in several cellular processes like protein degradation, endocytosis, signal transduction and DNA repair. The discovery of ubiquitin-like proteins (UBL) and ubiquitin-like domains (ULD) increases the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> pathways where {{the property of the}} ubiquitin-fold is profitable. Autophagy is the catabolic pathway used in cells to deliver cytosolic components and dysfunctional organelles to the lysosome for degradation. MAP 1 LC 3 proteins are ubiquitin-like proteins involved in one hand for the expansion of the autophagosome, which sequesters cytosolic substrates. In the other hand, these proteins (LC 3 - and GABARAP- subfamilies) bind to autophagic receptors linked to polyubiquitinated proteins aggregates. For this project, the 3 D structure of the GABARAPL- 1 /NBR 1 -LIR complex was determined and confirmed that GABARAPL- 1 belongs to the MAP 1 LC 3 proteins family, structurally characterized by an ubiquitin-fold, consisting of a central beta-sheet formed by four beta-strands and two alpha-helices {{on one side of the}} beta-sheet, preceded N terminally by two alpha-helices, resulting in the formation of two hydrophobic pockets, hp 1 and hp 2. The autophagic receptor NBR 1 interacts with GABARAPL- 1 through the hp 1 and hp 2 with its LIR motif taking an extended beta conformation upon binding, forming an intermolecular beta-sheet with the second beta-strand of GABARAPL 1. This LC 3 - interacting region (LIR) consists of an Theta XX Gamma sequence preceded by acidic amino acids, with Theta and Gamma represented by any aromatic and hydrophobic residues, respectively. Interaction studies of the LIR domains of p 62, Nix and NBR 1 with different members of the MAP 1 LC 3 proteins family indicate that the presence of a tryptophan in the LIR motif increases the binding affinity. Substitution to other aromatic amino acids or increasing the number of negatively charged residues at the N-terminus of the LIR motif, however, has little effect on the binding affinity due to enthalpy-entropy compensation, suggesting that effector proteins can interact with a wide variety of different sequences with similar and moderate binding affinities. Additionally to be present in proteins dealing with protein folding and degradation, ubiquitin-like domain were found protein involved in the regulation of signal transduction like TBK 1, a serine/threonine kinase responsible for induction of immune response. In this second project, based on the NMR chemical shifts of the TBK 1 domain contained between amino acids 302 and 383, secondary structure prediction programs (TALOS and CSI) confirmed the presence of an Ubiquitin-like domain in TBK 1 by identifying one alpha-helix and four beta-strands sequentially aligned like following beta-beta-alpha-beta-beta. This alignment corresponds perfectly with the secondary structure elements of Ubiquitin and proved that TBK 1 _ULD belongs to the UBL protein superfamily. The similarity to ubiquitin was even bigger by the presence in addition of a small beta-strand and a short helix, which are observed as the beta 5 -strand and a 310 -helix in Ubiquitin, respectively. The first attempts on the 3 D structure determination confirmed the Ub-fold but due to the lack of assignment in TBK 1 _ULD, only a structure based on ubiquitin as a model was determined. Interaction studies of TBK 1 _ULD with the IAD-SRR domain of IRF 3 showed that both side of the molecule seems involved and that the TBK 1 /IRF 3 interaction is more complex than a one to one binding process. Unfortunately, the instability of TBK 1 _ULD associated to the difficulty in the purification of IAD-SRR did not allow to further study this interaction more precisely. Finally, to overcome the difficulty encountered in NMR experiments because of low expression and/or poor solubility, an expression vector using the intrinsic property of ubiquitin was designed. Fused to proteins or peptides targets, this construct produced proteins and peptides in a larger amount than with traditional expression vectors and also with a less cost than chemical synthesis for pure labeled peptides for NMR structural studies. The presence of a hexa histidine tag was useful for the isolation and the purification of the constructs. The existence of a TEV cleavage site was created to keep the possibility of releasing the ubiquitin moiety from the expressed protein or peptide. Moreover, the ubiquitin-tag could also still be attached to the protein/peptide of interest when biophysical methods like NMR, ITC or CD spectroscopy are applied, providing the same results than for the protein/peptide moiety alone...|$|E
