Thus, this paper argues for establishing long-term goals emphasizing both adaptation and clean energy to generate equitable and effective global climate policy that addresses this fundamental threat. This requires defining and operationalizing the overall objective contained in Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. A second key aspect to operationalizing Article 2 is to understand those ‘particularly vulnerable’ as declared in the Article and in various climate agreements. Once operationalized, these long-term objectives can be achieved through approaches that emphasize the development of clean energy (and concomitant technology), and adaptation within vulnerable communities in their local context.

To study this phenomenon we modify the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model to disaggregate the household transportation sector. This improvement requires an extension of the GTAP data set that underlies the model. The revised and extended facility is then used to compare economic costs of cap-and-trade systems differentiated by sector, focusing on two regions: the USA where the fuel taxes are low, and Europe where the fuel taxes are high. We find that the interplay between carbon policies and pre-existing taxes leads to different results in these regions: in the USA exemption of transport from such a system would increase the welfare cost of achieving a <b>national</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>target,</b> while in Europe such exemptions will correct pre-existing distortions and reduce the cost.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{principles for}} carbon pricing that could attract a broad based and durable societal consensus in Australia. It applies these principles to a phased carbon pricing architecture as {{put forward by}} Australia’s Multi-­‐Party Committee on Climate Change, namely a government determined (fixed) carbon price transitioning to emissions trading. Linking to international carbon markets decouples Australia’s domestic carbon price from its <b>national</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>target,</b> allowing significant net <b>national</b> <b>emissions</b> reductions with manageable transitional impacts. A fixed price {{in the near term}} can end costly delays to carbon pricing while dealing with uncertainties about Australia’s target and international markets. A strategy is outlined to manage international uncertainties and to accommodate the multiple goals of domestic constituencies, while achieving efficiency and effectiveness. First, ensure the medium term carbon price is high enough to for emissions to begin to trend down in the next few years, recognising that investment decisions are shaped by current expectations about future prices. Second, set the initial price at a level that gives confidence that short run impacts will be manageable, given other transitional assistance. Third, ensure that wider policy settings do not compromise incentives for reducing emissions, and make the scheme robust in the face of competing claims for carbon revenue and lobbying efforts. For Australian carbon pricing policy, these principles suggest the carbon price may need to rise rapidly {{over the course of the}} decade, to double or more compared to starting prices that are currently in the Australian discussion. Payments of carbon pricing revenue to industry may need to be limited to create more room for income tax cuts, possibly by means of an overall cap and accelerated phase-­‐out of industry assistance.

In contrast, consumption-based emissions accounting would shift attention from production to consumption.

We address this arguably basic question by purely statistical methods that do not rely on any normative judgment about the criteria according to which it should be answered. The sum of current Nationally Determined Contributions to reducing GHG emissions would result in an average temperature rise in 2100 {{of the order of}} 3 °C to 3. 2 °C. Implementing policies that enable to achieve the objective of a worldwide average temperature rise below 2 °C obviously requires setting a more consistent and efficient set of <b>national</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>targets.</b> While a scientific consensus has been reached about the global carbon budget that we are acing, given the 2 °C target of the Paris Agreement, no such consensus prevails on how this budget is to be divided among countries. This paper proposes a Climate Liabilities Assessment Integrated Methodology (CLAIM) which enables to determine national GHG budgets compliant with any average temperature target and time horizon. Our methodology does neither resort to any scenario nor any simulation-based model. Rather, it computes the allocation of 2 °C-compatible national carbon budgets which has a priori the highest probability of emerging from the international discussion, whatever being the criteria on which the latter might be based. As such it provides a framework ensuring the highest probability of reaching a consensus. In particular, it avoids the pitfall of arbitrarily assigning weights according, say, to “capacity” or “responsibility” criteria, and simultaneously unifies the different methodologies that have been proposed in the literature aiming at setting national GHG budgets. Sensitivity tests confirm the robustness of our methodology...|$|R

In the small-country case emissions control turns out to be efficient if tax rates in the trading sector are flexible. Otherwise it is second-best to violate cost effectiveness and to choose an excessive endowment of tradable permits.

The EEA and the European Member States {{follow these}} {{obligations}} by modelling their individual <b>emission</b> <b>targets.</b> However, <b>national</b> <b>emission</b> ceilings {{laid down in}} European Commission's Directive status reports are not based on actual recorded pollution but on computed theoretical modelling such as e.g. TREMOVE, TREMOD or COPERT[78]. Modelling of toxic traffic emissions may thus be based on overall national fuel consumption[19]. Even that, any model acknowledges to comprise potential errors - e.g. TREMOVE considers these to be 17 % to 19 % of computed NO [...]...|$|R
40|$|The {{study by}} Jonas et al. (2014) has {{received}} interest, notably by the Austrian Climate Research Programme [ACRP], {{regarding the use}} of the results at national scales. Jonas et al. discuss diagnostic (retrospective: looking back in time) and prognostic (prospective: looking forward in time) uncertainty in an emissions-temperature-uncertainty framework that allows any country to understand its near-term mitigation and adaptation efforts in a globally consistent and long-term context which includes all countries and stipulates global warming to range between 2 and 4 °C. To achieve this understanding, the study established <b>national</b> linear <b>emission</b> <b>target</b> paths (e. g., from 1990 to 2050) that are globally consistent. In this systems context, cumulative emissions until 2050 are constrained and globally binding but are uncertain (i. e., they can be estimated only imprecisely); and whether or not compliance with an agreed temperature target in 2050 and beyond will be achieved is also uncertain. In a nutshell, the emissions-temperature-uncertainty framework can be used to monitor a country’s performance - past as well as prospective achievements - in complying with a future warming target in a quantified uncertainty-risk context. Our working paper (i) recalls the background of the study by Jonas et al. in a condensed but comprehensive manner; and (ii) provides {{a detailed description of the}} study’s input and output data which have been updated in the meantime. The paper uses Austria as a case country, while placing it in a European and global context...|$|R
