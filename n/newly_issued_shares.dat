25|$|When {{a company}} lists its {{securities}} {{on a public}} exchange, the money paid by the investing public for then <b>newly</b> <b>issued</b> <b>shares</b> goes directly to the company (primary offering) {{as well as to}} any early private investors who opt to sell all or a portion of their holdings (secondary offerings) as part of the larger IPO. An IPO, therefore, allows a company to tap into a wide pool of potential investors to provide itself with capital for future growth, repayment of debt, or working capital. A company selling common shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. Those investors must endure the unpredictable nature of the open market to price and trade their shares. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. For early private investors who choose to sell shares as part of the IPO process, the IPO represents an opportunity to monetize their investment. After the IPO, once shares trade in the open market, investors holding large blocks of shares can either sell those shares piecemeal in the open market, or sell a large block of shares directly to the public, at a fixed price, through a secondary market offering. This type of offering is not dilutive, since no new shares are being created.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} IFRS adoption on IPO underpricing; the latter is, as known, the positive spread between {{the first day of}} trading closing price and the offer price of a <b>newly</b> <b>issued</b> <b>share.</b> The phenomenon of underpricing is usually associated with information asymmetry among the actors involved in the process of listing. Some scholars suppose that IPO firms’ use of IFRS rather than domestic GAAP affect IPO underpricing through two mechanisms: (1) the quality, and (2) the comparability of financial reports. Our study is the first research that studies the impact of IAS/IFRS on the underpricing of IPOs in the Italian stock market. We find that IFRS adoption is not associated with a decrease in IPO underpricing and the only factor that is associated with this phenomenon is the trend of the financial market. Referring to the Italian stock market, our results suggest that IFRS adoption does not reduce information asymmetries among investors, probably due to the lax of enforcement which seems characterize the Italian environment...|$|R

2500|$|The {{bank was}} also {{required}} to have a reserve capital {{which could be used}} to cover losses, guarantee 8% annual dividend, or timely payment of interest on mortgage bonds in case of a borrower's default. The reserve capital had to be at least a third (later half) of its stock capital and at least a third of it had to be invested in Russian government bonds or deposited with the State Bank of the Russian Empire. Investment income from Russian government bonds and 5% of annual profit were transferred to this reserve capital. From 1883, <b>newly</b> <b>issued</b> <b>shares</b> were required to be sold at a premium over the nominal face value to build up the reserve. The bank achieved the required reserve level (4.8 million rubles) in 1904. From 1899, the bank had a second special reserve to cover investment losses. Due to requirements of keeping capital invested (mostly stocks of railway companies and Russian government bonds), the bank suffered significant losses (10.4 million rubles) in 1900–1905.|$|E
2500|$|While {{corporate}} governance primarily concerns the general relative {{rights and duties}} of shareholders, employees and directors in terms of administration and accountability, corporate finance concerns how the monetary or capital stake of shareholders and creditors are mediated, given {{the risk that the}} business may fail and become insolvent. Companies can fund their operations either through debt (i.e. loans) or equity (i.e. shares). In return for loans, typically from a bank, companies will often be required by contract to give their creditors a security interest over the company's assets, so that in the event of insolvency, the creditor may take the secured asset. The Insolvency Act 1986 limits powerful creditors ability to sweep up all company assets as security, particularly through a floating charge, in favour of vulnerable creditors, such as employees or consumers. If money is raised by offering shares, the shareholders' relations are determined as a group by the provisions under the constitution. The law requires disclosure of all material facts in promotions, and prospectuses. Company constitutions typically require that existing shareholders have a pre-emption right, to buy <b>newly</b> <b>issued</b> <b>shares</b> before outside shareholders and thus avoid their stake and control becoming diluted. Actual rights, however, are determined by ordinary principles of construction of the company constitution. A host of rules exist to ensure that the company's capital (i.e. the amount that shareholders paid in when they bought their shares) is maintained for the benefit of creditors. Money is typically distributed to shareholders through dividends as the reward for investment. These should only come out of profits, or surpluses beyond the capital account. If companies pay out money to shareholders which in effect is a dividend [...] "disguised" [...] as something else, directors will be liable for repayment. Companies may, however, reduce their capital to a lower figure if directors of private companies warrant solvency, or courts approve a public company's reduction. Because a company buying back shares from shareholders in itself, or taking back redeemable shares, has the same effect as a reduction of capital, similar transparency and procedural requirements need to be fulfilled. Public companies are also precluded from giving financial assistance for purchase of their shares, for example through a leveraged buyout, unless the company is delisted and or taken private. Finally, in order to protect investors from being placed at an unfair disadvantage, people inside a company are under a strict duty to not trade on any information that could affect a company's share price for their own benefit.|$|E

But in contrast to traditional organizations, Bitcoin {{does not have a}} CEO or top management team but instead developers who “write the rulebook,” i.e., define governance rules for the program (Narayanan et al. 2016, pp. 173 – 175). Bitcoin does not have headquarters, subsidiaries, or employees, but a distributed network of users and miners who collect, verify, and update transactions on a shared public ledger that is publicly auditable. Decisions on code modifications are made through community-based democratic voting processes, backed by miners’ computing power for implementation (Narayanan et al. 2016, pp. 173 – 175).|$|R

5000|$|After {{getting into}} {{financial}} difficulty, Harold {{reached an agreement}} with Molson Brewery in November 1980, {{which at the time}} owned the Montreal Canadiens, for the company to cover his debt financing charges on a loan of $8.8 million for 10 years in exchange for an option to purchase a 19.9% block of shares in MLGL from HEBL and a right of first refusal on the rest of HEBL's shares. [...] The NHL did not learn of the deal until the late 1980s. In 1982, he offered to sell the company for $50 million, with the arena alone reportedly valued at $11 million, though a stockholders' report the following year placed the value of MLGL at $23.5 million. When Harold transferred ownership of his personal real estate holdings, which were valued at $2.52 million, to HEBL in January 1989, he acquired 4 <b>newly</b> <b>issued</b> common <b>shares</b> in the company plus a promise of a further $896,472 rather than cash. Mary Elizabeth sold her stake in HEBL to her father for $15.5 million in January 1989, after originally having a deal to sell the stake to Don Giffin, while Harold Jr. sold his back to HEBL for $21 million in June of the same year. Harold secured a loan from Molson for the full amount of his buyout of Mary Elizabeth, using the 34 acquired shares in HEBL as security. Harold Jr.'s shares were subsequently retired. Bill sued his father for $170 million over HEBL's acquisition of Harold Jr.'s stake, claiming that he and partner Michael Cohl had acquired a right of first refusal to purchase the shares for $20 million that February. Shortly thereafter, HEBL issued Harold 32 common shares and $125,216 in exchange for ownership of his 350,200 personally held MLGL shares and $125,000. Two more new common shares would be granted to Harold to repay the $911,000 debt HEBL owed him from his two transactions with the company. This gave Harold, who feared that Bill was positioning himself to take over the holding company, control of HEBL. Harold did not want his bickering children to inherit MLGL because he feared they would destroy it.|$|R
