40|$|Approaching the <b>national</b> <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> (KP) targets {{involves}} a re-definition {{of the actual}} configuration of local energy systems. This study deals with a local scale application of the IEA-MARKAL models generator, in which the anthropogenic system of Basilicata Region (Southern Italy) is investigated to support the definition of coherent long-term strategies and sound climate protection policies. A scenario by scenario analysis points out the behaviour of the optimal mix of fuels and technologies {{in the presence of}} carbon dioxide emissions constraints. Trade off curves and reduced costs analyses outline the most effective actions for contributing to the national KP targets, with particular emphasis on the interventions in Civil (Residential, Commercial & Services) and waste management sectors.

50|$|The <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> is an {{international}} treaty designed to reduce emissions of GHGs. The Kyoto treaty was agreed in 1997, and is a protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which had previously been agreed in 1992. The <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> sets legally-blinding emissions limitations for developed countries ("Annex I Parties") out to 2008-2012. The US has not ratified the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol,</b> and its target is therefore non-binding. Canada has ratified the treaty, but withdrew in 2011.|$|R

The first part of the paper describes the main features and characteristics of the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> to achieve the ultimate aim of the reduction of anthropogenic GHG emissions to a level which would prevent dangerous interference with the climatic system. The paper goes on to identify and discuss the major problems linked with the signature and ratification process {{as well as with the}} effective implementation of the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> around the world. In the second part of the paper, the focus shifts to Italy, and a description and analysis of the Italian policies and measures planned before and after the adoption of the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> is provided. The attention is drawn to the 1998 National Plan for the reduction of GHG emissions. In the final paragraph of the paper, Italy's pro-active approach in planning the implementation of the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> is placed in a Mediterranean context to see which role the implementation of the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> could play in the light of the promotion of sustainable development in the Mediterranean area as a whole...|$|R

50|$|The Partnership {{has been}} {{publicly}} supported {{as an alternative}} to the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> by governments and business groups in some countries, particularly in countries where the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> has not been ratified. Many commentators have particularly welcomed the fact that the Partnership overcomes the impasse between developed and developing countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> and has led to India and China taking some steps to address their greenhouse gas emissions. Mexico, Russia, and several ASEAN members have expressed interest in joining the Partnership in the future.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> focuses {{primarily}} on the production of greenhouse gases and not the consumption. For example, a nation may import high carbon goods such as steel or aluminum, but still have a relatively low output of greenhouse gases. The <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> places {{a large amount of}} pressure on Annex 1 nations to reduce their emissions. Annex 1 nations face harsher goals of emission reduction compared to non-Annex 1 nations. The <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> also establishes carbon emission caps that create strain on industrialized nations and their ability to produce and consume goods.|$|R

The flexibility mechanisms were introduced into the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> by the US government. Developing countries were highly skeptical and fiercely opposed to the flexibility mechanisms (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 6). However, the international negotiations over the follow-up to the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> agreed that the mechanisms will continue.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{criticism}} that the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> does not do enough {{to address the issue}} of climate change and pollution in the long run. One criticism is that climate change is an unique environmental issue, but the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> followed the format of the other international treaties (not necessarily useful for environmental issues) instead of promoting innovation in approaching the issue of global warming. [...] Another criticism is that the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> focuses too much on carbon emissions and doesn’t address other pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which either do direct harm to human health and/or can be addressed using technology. Some also claim that the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> does not promote long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but rather short-term solutions in having countries try to meet emission reduction standards (either by lowering emissions or find ways to obtain trading credits). In the same way, there has been {{criticism that}} the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> does not address the concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases, but rather greenhouse gas emissions, focusing on the short-term over the long-term.|$|R
