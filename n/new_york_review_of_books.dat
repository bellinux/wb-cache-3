5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} Robb McKenzie in Library Journal, the psychoanalyst Herbert Hendin in The New York Times, and J. M. Cameron in The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Books.</b> The book was also reviewed in the Atlantic Monthly.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{positively}} received by reviewers, including Jeffrey Rosen in The New York Times, Richard H. Fallon in Harvard Magazine, Nat Hentoff, two National Book Critics Circle members, and Kirkus Reviews. Jeremy Waldron {{commented on the}} work for The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Books</b> and criticized Lewis' stance towards freedom of speech with respect to hate speech. Waldron elaborated on this criticism in his book The Harm in Hate Speech (2012), in which he devoted a chapter to Lewis' book. This prompted a critical analysis of both works in The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Books</b> in June 2012 by former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.|$|E

5|$|In {{his book}} Darwin's Dangerous Idea, philosopher Daniel Dennett is {{especially}} critical of Gould's presentation of punctuated equilibrium. Dennett argues that Gould alternated between revolutionary and conservative claims, {{and that each}} time Gould made a revolutionary statement—or appeared to do so—he was criticized, and thus retreated to a traditional neo-Darwinian position. Gould responded to Dennett's claims in The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Books,</b> and in his technical volume The Structure of Evolutionary Theory.|$|E
5|$|Jeremy Waldron {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Books,</b> and was critical of Lewis' broad stance towards freedom of speech with respect to hate speech. Waldron later elaborated this position in his 2012 book The Harm in Hate Speech, in which he devoted an entire chapter to Lewis' book. Waldron emphasized that the problem with an expansive view of free speech is not the harm of hateful thoughts, but rather the negative impact resulting from widespread publication of the thoughts. He questioned whether children of racial groups criticized by widely published hate speech {{would be able to}} succeed in such an environment. Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens analyzed The Harm in Hate Speech and discussed Freedom for the Thought That We Hate, in a review for The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Books.</b> Justice Stevens recounted Lewis' argument that an acceptance of hate speech is necessary, because attempts to regulate it would cause encroachment upon expression of controversial viewpoints. He pointed out that Lewis and Waldron agreed that Americans have more freedom of speech than citizens of any other country. In his review, Stevens cited the 2011 decision in Snyder v. Phelps as evidence {{that the majority of the}} U.S. Supreme Court supported the right of the people to express hateful views on matters of public importance. Stevens concluded that, although Waldron was unsuccessful in convincing him that legislators should ban all hate speech, The Harm in Hate Speech persuaded him that government leaders should refrain from using such language themselves.|$|E
5|$|Auden began {{summering}} in Europe, {{together with}} Chester Kallman, in 1948, first in Ischia, Italy, where he rented a house, then, starting in 1958, in Kirchstetten, Austria, where {{he bought a}} farmhouse from the prize money of the Premio Feltrinelli awarded to him in 1957, and, he said, shed tears of joy at owning {{a home for the}} first time. In 1956–61, Auden was Professor of Poetry at Oxford University where he was required to give three lectures each year. This fairly light workload allowed him to continue to winter in New York, where he lived at 77 St. Mark's Place in Manhattan's East Village, and to summer in Europe, spending only three weeks each year lecturing in Oxford. He earned his income mostly from readings and lecture tours, and by writing for The New Yorker, The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Books,</b> and other magazines.|$|E

5|$|In May 2015, a New York Times exposé by Sarah Maslin Nir on {{the working}} {{conditions}} of manicurists in New York City and elsewhere {{and the health}} hazards {{to which they are}} exposed attracted wide attention, resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo. In July 2015, the story's claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former New York Times reporter Richard Bernstein, in the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Review</b> <b>of</b> <b>Books.</b> Bernstein, whose wife owns two nail salons, asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience, and were not evidenced by ads in the Chinese-language papers cited by the story. The New York Times editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein's criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy. The independent NYT Public Editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with Bernstein and looked into his complaints, and expressed her belief that the story's reporting was sound.|$|E
