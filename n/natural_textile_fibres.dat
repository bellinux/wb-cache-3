40|$|The {{concept of}} ‘environmental awareness’ has {{recently}} had {{a major impact on}} the textile industry and on the fashion world as well. In this context, the use of natural fibres and the development of natural dyeing processes gradually became important goals of the textile industry. Of all <b>natural</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibres,</b> hemp is considered {{to be one of the}} strongest and most durable. A wide range of natural extracts have been used for natural textile coloration and dyeing. Dyes deriving from natural sources have emerged as an important alternative to synthetic dyes. Ecofriendly, nontoxic, sustainable and renewable natural dyes and pigments have been used for colouring the food substrate, leather, wood, natural fibres and fabrics from the dawn of human history. The purpose of the research is to obtain ecologically coloured fabrics for textiles by using a method of dyeing that relies on natural ingredients extracted from red beet, onion leaves and black tea. The experiments are conducted on three different types of hemp fabrics. This paper presents the results of the studies regarding the dyeing process of hemp fabrics with natural extracts, the colours of the dyed samples inspected with reflectance spectra and the CIE L*a*b* colour space measurements...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of utilising <b>natural</b> <b>textile</b> materials as reinforcements for engineering composites applications. The definition and types of textile materials are addressed to provide readers a thoughtful view {{on the role of}} these materials in a structural composite system. Available material properties of <b>natural</b> <b>textile</b> and their composites are critically reviewed here. In general, these materials are categorised into fibre, yarn and fabric forms. The load bearing capacity of <b>natural</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer composites is governed by the quantity, alignment and dispersion properties of fibres. It has been found that the natural fibre reinforced composites are limited to use in low to medium load bearing applications. However, a limited research work has been performed to date and there is a significant gap between the high performance textile fabric and their use as reinforcement in fibre reinforced composite materials. &# 0169...|$|R

Pre-treatment plays a significant role for the successful coloration of any kind of <b>natural</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> like wool. This paper overview the influence of different types of contemporary preparation techniques applied on wool fibre before coloration such as scouring, carbonising and bleaching. However, traditional wool pre-treatment utilize different chemicals those generate pollution in the effluents; a few of them are erosive which could damage the equipment and the fabric as well. Hence, it also focuses on the recently introduced eco-friendly enzyme based biological application and plasma treatment on wool fibre preparation...|$|R
40|$|Cotton, as the world’s main <b>natural</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibre,</b> is {{the focus}} of many studies for genetic {{improvement}} of fibre quality. Two allotetraploid (AtDt genome, 2 n= 4 X= 52) species dominate world production: G. hirsutum (Gh) with medium fibre quality and G. barbadense (Gb) with high fibre quality, accounting for 95 % / 3 % of production respectively. A RIL population originating from a Gh-Gb cross is the base material of the CIRAD-Bayer CropScience-CSIRO ANR research project Cotton_RILs, aiming at the genetic and genomic dissection of cotton fibre quality for introgression of high fibre quality genes of Gb into Gh germplasm. Until now, classical breeding did not succeed at satisfactorily combining traits from both cotton species, in spite of high apparent synteny conservation between their chromosomes. The fixed heterozygosity of allopolyploids is supposed to result in gene expression changes, or expression subfonctionalization, a partitioning of the ancestral expression domains among duplicate genes. It is hypothesized that allopolyploids should be subject to more genetic and epigenetic regulatory changes than autopolyploids. We report here on evidence of interactions between markers on pairs of homoeologou...|$|R

40|$|Background Cotton is the {{dominant}} source of <b>natural</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> and a significant oil crop. Cotton fibres, produced by certain species in the genus Gossypium, are seed trichomes derived from individual cells of the epidermal layer of the seed coat. Cotton fibre development is delineated into four distinct and overlapping developmental stages: fibre initiation, elongation, secondary wall biosynthesis and maturation. † Scope Recent advances in gene expression studies are beginning to provide new insights into {{a better understanding of}} early events in cotton fibre development. Fibre cell development is a complex process involving many pathways, including various signal transduction and transcriptional regulation components. Several analyses using expressed sequence tags and microarray have identified transcripts that preferentially accumulate during fibre development. These studies, as well as complementation and overexpression experiments using cotton genes in arabidopsis and tobacco, indicate some similar molecular events between trichome development from the leaf epidermis and fibre development from the ovule epidermis. Specifically, MYB transcription factors regulate leaf trichome development in arabidopsis and may regulate seed trichome development in cotton. In addition, transcript profiling and ovule culture experiments both indicate that several phytohormones and other signalling pathways mediate cotton fibre development. Auxin and gibberellins promote early stages of fibre initiation; ethylene- and brassinosteroidrelated genes are up-regulated during the fibre elongation phase; and genes associated with calmodulin an...|$|R

However, there are some defects of cotton cellulose fabrics which are easily wrinkling after being washed or immersed in water and sensitive to fire causing fatalities. Applying wrinkle-resistant finishing and flame-retardant finishing on cotton cellulose are the major issues studied in this thesis. The formulations of the two functional finishes were modified with addition of metal oxides and varying the curing condition in order to attain the best fabric performance after treatment. Different combinations of curing temperature and curing time have been studied to investigate the performance of functional finishing. It was found that curing temperature and curing time have significant effect on the wrinkle-resistant performance and the flame-retardant performance. Higher curing temperature and longer curing time resulted in a better performance as there was sufficient energy and duration for the reaction occurred. Moreover, it was confirmed that the addition of titanium dioxide (TiO₂) have positive influence to the fabric functional performance with lower curing temperature. The treatment effectiveness can be enhanced by the addition of metal oxides which can improve the adverse effects of the treatment. The surface morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy and other advanced analytical techniques that gave the structural information of the treated fabrics. Besides, the role of TiO₂ in the two finishing treatments had been proposed. Finally, as fabric hand is a critical physical property of fabrics, the objective measurement of low stress mechanical properties had been investigated by KES-F in order to evaluate the fabric hand. The fabric hand became worse than the untreated cotton fabrics after functional finishing. Institute of Textiles and ClothingM.

40|$|The {{topic of}} the master’s {{qualification}} project is the research of the dimensional stability of the linen and cotton fabric. The aim {{of the work is}} to compare the research results of the dimensional stability of woven fabrics, which were received by the standard and image analysis methods. According to the characteristic of dimensional stability to analyze possibilities to use linen and cotton the fabrics in interior design. In the work the review of <b>natural</b> <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> – linen and cotton, also original fabrics, is presented, the problem of textile dimensional stability is discussed and evaluation methods of known research method are analyzed. The work studies moisture impact on linen and cotton fabrics form stability. Three specimen groups were created and their main parameters were defined. The measurements of shrinkage using standard and image analysis methods were performed and obtained results were compared. It is estimated that the measurement results of marked specimen points using the method of image analysis slightly differs from the results received by using standard measurements of fabrics. It was assessed that the method of image analysis provides quite precise results and can be used to evaluate stability of fabric’s dimensions. The variations of the results of space double fabrics received by using different measurement technique are influenced by complex structure of the fabrics surface, colour and weave. There is influence of not smooth fabrics surface and not sufficient contrast between marks and the background on the results of image analysis, therefore the result differences between standard measurements and image analysis are higher. The project part reviews the possibilities to apply shrinkable linen and cotton fabrics in the modern interior design. After reviewing the analogues of products, an original product was a created – Austrian type curtain, constructional and technological solutions of the product were presented, economical evaluation was given.

40|$|Our {{objective}} is to define the most appropriate non-contact spectroscopic protocol with which to interrogate the identity, moisture content and chemical character of organic heritage artefacts, as exemplified by textiles, for informed conservation and long-term preservation. Here we report initial work on the application of near infrared (NIR) and terahertz (THz) spectroscopy to the analyses of <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>textiles.</b> NIR wavelengths are sufficiently short for efficient transmission of the radiation through fibre optics, so that remote sampling is possible. THz spectroscopy has been developed much more recently as an analytical tool, and also offers a truly non-destructive approach. We have recorded non-contact NIR (7800 - 4000 cm? 1) and THz (10 GHz - 2 THz) spectra of linen and other textile fabrics. While the terahertz spectra are not immediately distinct, the near infrared spectra allow differentiation of the broad categories of textiles. THz absorption increases with moisture sorption; besides microstructural and chemical information, NIR spectra may also reveal the moisture content of fabrics.

40|$|Throughout antiquity, textile {{manufacture}} was practiced on {{all levels}} of society {{and was one of}} the most labour-intensive of all occupations. As such, it was an industry of great cultural and social importance, which should be factored into any balanced assessment of the ancient economy. Over the last two decades, textile research has demonstrated how much we can learn about the culture, society, technology and economy of the ancient world through archaeological textiles. Textile quality and appearance are dependent on the material of which the textile has been made, that is fibre. Fibre investigation, hence, is more than just identification of material source. By studying fibre on a microscopic level we can come closer to understanding issues of selective breeding/ cultivation, processing of fibres, and their wear. <b>Textile</b> <b>fibre</b> exploitation has had a great impact on subsistence strategies of past societies, which were transformed when plant fibre was largely replaced by animal fibre during Bronze Age. Investigation of <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> development is thus essential to the interpretation of much wider aspects of ancient societies, such as agriculture, animal husbandry, domestication and technology.
