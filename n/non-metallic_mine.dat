40|$|A remote-sensing method {{based on}} active {{high-power}} microwave (HPM) illumination and detection {{in the infrared}} (IR) region is described {{for the detection of}} shallow buried landmines. This method is based on different interactions of the incident HPM radiation with the mine and the surrounding soil which occur due to a difference in their complex dielectric constants. This leads {{to the development of a}} thermal signature of the mine at the soil surface that can be detected in the infrared region. The thermal signature which is observed initially in near real-time persists for several minutes following HPM illumination. It is primarily made up of two components. The first component appears on the soil surface in near real-time due to the interference of the incident HPM beam and the HPM beam reflected by the mine. A second signature is due to the absorption of microwave energy by the mine. This signature appears at the soil surface after a brief time-delay from the start of HPM illumination. At any instant, the resultant thermal signature at the soil surface is the sum of the two time-dependent signatures. In this report we provide both laboratory and field trial results obtained using this method to detect metallic and <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mine</b> surrogates, dummy mines without explosives and live mines wit...|$|E
40|$|The JASON Committee at MITRE Corp. was tasked by DARPA {{to inquire}} into {{suitable}} technologies for humanitarian mine detection. Acoustic resonance {{was one of}} the very few technologies that the JASONs determined might be promising for the task, but was as yet unexplored at the time that they conducted their inquiry. The objective of this Seed Money investigation into acoustic resonance was to determine if it would be feasible to use acoustic resonance to provide an improvement to present methods for humanitarian mine detection. As detailed in this report, acoustic resonance methods do not appear to be feasible for this task. Although acoustic resonant responses are relatively easy to detect when they exist, they are very difficult to excite by the non-contact means that must be used for buried objects. Despite many different attempts, this research did not discover any practical means of using sound to excite resonant responses in objects known to have strong resonances. The shaker table experiments did see an effect that might be attributable to the resonance of the object under test, but the effect was weak, and exploited the a priori knowledge of the resonant frequency of the object under test to distinguish it from the background. If experiments that used objects known to have strong acoustic resonances produced such marginal results, this does not seem to be a practical method to detect objects with weak resonances or non-existent resonances. The results of this work contribute to the ORNL countermine initiative. ORNL is exploring several unconventional mine detection technologies, and is proposed to explore others. Since this research has discovered some major pitfalls in <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mine</b> detection, this experience will add realism to other strategies proposed for mine detection technologies. The experiment provided hands-on experience with inert plastic mines under field conditions, and gives ORNL additional insight into the problems of developing practical field-deployable methods of mine detection...|$|E

The initiation of this program began in the year 2000 and was designed to concentrate on pollution that was originating from <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mining</b> sites. The goal of the mandate was to set a series of guidelines, developed by the Regulatory Authority (Buffalo County), to which quarry operators must adhere. Guidelines are prepared to “reclaim ” mined areas to return the land to a similar condition as prior to mining (Anonymous. A Guide to Developing Reclamation Plans for Nonmetallic Mining Sites in Wisconsin). As part of mining program requirements, Buffalo County is developing a series of resource modeling efforts in hopes of protecting natural resources. Such resource modeling involves stream protection (mines contributing point sources of sedimentation), identifying homes at risk of blasting repercussions (well collapse), slope analyses (runoff), traffic analyses (safety), and groundwater/geologic analyses. Furthermore, administrative methodologies are an important tool in governing the newly established program. Continual efforts are made at the county level to analyze proper program administration. Serving as a ‘pilot program,’ the <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mining</b> program offers Buffalo County the opportunity to develop an administrative GIS research/resource model {{that can be used for}} other programs and/or projects that will benefit from a comprehensive GIS – administrative approach to conserving natural resources and managing programs effectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract only availableThroughout {{the twentieth}} century, landmines {{have been used}} to inhibit the {{movement}} of military troops and vehicles. Traditionally, metal detectors {{have been used to}} effectively detect these mines. However, today, many varieties of mines are plastic-cased and contain little or no metal content, making traditional detection methods ineffective. For both military and humanitarian de-mining, a practical and reliable detection method is needed. In response to this need, several alternative detection technologies are being developed. These modern technologies are faced with the challenge of distinguishing buried <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mines</b> from rocks and other geological clutter. They also have to be capable of operating under a variety of environmental and soil conditions. One such technology being developed is ground penetrating radar (GPR). By transmitting high frequency electromagnetic pulses into the ground and analyzing the reflected signals with a detection algorithm, both metallic and <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mines</b> can be identified with relatively high success. However, a tradeoff occurs when trying to maximize the detection rate: as the sensitivity of the detection algorithm is increased, the number of false alarms is also increased. Having a high detection rate is crucial to the reliability of the detection system, but having a high false alarm rate makes it impractical to use. The goal of this research is to optimize both of these factors, by statistically correlating the results of multiple detection algorithms and fusing their confidence outputs together. By incorporating multiple algorithms in the detection process, the benefits of the individual algorithms can be coalesced to improve the overall detection and false alarm rates.

50|$|A minimum metal mine is a {{land mine}} that is {{designed}} to use the smallest amount of metal possible in its construction. Typically, the only metal components are located inside the fuze mechanism which triggers detonation. Both minimum metal anti-tank and anti-personnel mines exist. Some designs contain virtually no metal at all e.g. less than a gram. This is achieved by encasing the explosive charge in a plastic, wooden, or glass body, with metallic components limited to the few small parts in the fuze which can not easily be made from other materials, such as the spring, striker tip, and shear pin. Minimum metal mines are extremely difficult to detect using conventional metal mine detectors and usually require modern techniques, such as robotic Multi Period Sensing (MPS) equipment, to identify, but it is still too difficult to find <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mines.</b> These techniques are usually restricted to well-funded international mine clearing organizations and major militaries, making minimum metal mines especially pernicious where they are encountered.|$|R

The lack of a quantitative inventory data for social issues is a weakness of the S-LCA methodology to calculate social impacts. This study aims to establish a social inventory database in Thailand using input–output (IO) modeling. The 2005 economic IO table of Thailand is used in this study. The six different social issues are calculated for both direct and indirect social intensity. The social issues include employment, number of female employees, working hours, wages and salaries, and non-fatal and fatal occupational cases. The results indicate that the primary sector has the highest social intensity in terms of employment, female employment, and working hour intensity. Meanwhile, the secondary sector was higher in non-fatal occupational cases intensity than other sectors. For wages intensity, the results show that the government sector was higher than other sectors, it being labor intensive and of low economic value. In addition, the fatal occupational cases shows the highest intensity in the <b>non-metallic</b> <b>mining,</b> fertilizer and pesticides, and construction sectors.

In {{order to determine the}} feasibility of undertaking an urban-scale MFA {{in the global}} south, this dissertation sets out to undertake an MFA on Cape Town, and thoroughly analyze the data collection process, document the challenges, and interpret data quantity and quality. Data were found for nearly all flows defined in the Eurostat methodology, but only for the most recent of three consecutive years under study. Data quality is challenged by high variance in reliability of sources, difficulty in obtaining documents, additional work required to process the data, lack of data on informal or illegal flows, and the scattered distribution of sources. Data collection took 345 hours during a period of 22 weeks and involved interaction with a total of 325 contacts and 86 documents. The principal activities were related to contacting and interacting with people. Most time was spent on e-mailing and meeting people, and significant time was furthermore spent on transportation to and from meetings. Not all time was spent effectively and efficiently. Chasing unreliable data and unproductive cross-checking were the principal culprits. Despite the challenges, {{the quantity and quality of}} data are of a sufficient level to provide interesting insights into the urban metabolism for Cape Town, and undertaking this kind of urban-scale MFA is thus deemed feasible. Once a time-consuming, initial MFA has identified valuable and reliable sources, periodic repetition should be relatively uncomplicated. Through government involvement or industry cooperation, data collection and data sharing with a few key stakeholders can make regular urban MFA reporting a feasible reality. This work shows who those key stakeholders are and how researchers and government can undertake and improve future urban MFA studies - not only on Cape Town but also on other regions and cities in South Africa. This MFA feasibility study furthermore provided useful insight into the metabolism of Cape Town. For 2013, local extraction was 1. 53 t per capita, mostly consisting of <b>non-metallic</b> minerals <b>mined</b> within the borders of Cape Town. Wild fish catch is half of the biomass extraction. Imports and exports were 4. 04 t and 2. 15 t per capita, respectively, with food and fossil fuels weighing heavily on the imports. The exports are dominated by processed foods and products from the manufacturing industry. Emissions to air can be contrasted with the results from Gasson (2007). Significant per-capita emission increases are seen for CO 2, coupled with decreases for most other emissions to air.
