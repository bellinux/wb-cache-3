5|$|According to the chronicles of the Hindu monastic institution, the Kanchi matha, the matha was {{temporarily}} transferred to Kumbakonam in the 1780s following {{an invasion of}} Kanchipuram by Hyder Ali of Mysore. When Tipu Sultan invaded {{the east coast of}} South India in 1784, Kumbakonam bore the brunt of his invasion. The produce fell sharply and the economy collapsed. Kumbakonam did <b>not</b> <b>recover</b> from the calamity till the beginning of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Darlington's {{promotion}} campaign was dealt a blow in February 2009, when club chairman George Houghton placed {{the club in}} administration. As a result, the club were deducted 10points, a penalty from which they could <b>not</b> <b>recover</b> finally finishing 12th. Burgmeier finished with two goals during the season having played 35games, but {{like the rest of}} the playing squad, was told he could find a new club by Darlington's administrators.|$|E
5|$|In 694, Ine {{extracted}} {{compensation of}} 30,000 pence from the Kentishmen {{for the death}} of Mul; this amount represented the value of an aetheling's life in the Saxon system of Weregild. Ine appears to have retained control of Surrey, but did <b>not</b> <b>recover</b> Kent. No king of Wessex was to venture so far east until Egbert, over a hundred years later.|$|E

5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt that she would <b>not</b> <b>recover,</b> and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E
5|$|After Biden {{withdrew from}} the race, it was learned that he had indeed {{correctly}} credited Kinnock on other occasions. But in the Iowa speech that was recorded and distributed to reporters (with a parallel video of Kinnock) by aides to Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee, he failed to do so. Dukakis, who disowned any knowledge of the Kinnock video, fired John Sasso, his campaign manager and long-time Chief of Staff, but Biden's campaign could <b>not</b> <b>recover.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{living in}} his new house for three years, Big Jim died of {{tuberculosis}} on October14, 1858. His widow, Elizabeth, {{lived in the house}} until after the Civil War. In 1867 or 1869, she sold the house, the Collins Tract and the remainder of Lot Number20 to Charles Harmison (1823–1896) for $8,500, moving with her remaining children to Missouri (where she died in 1883). The cost of building the house financially strained the Parsons family; historian Catherine Snider Long suggests that Elizabeth Miller Parsons sold the house as a result of additional, war-related financial stress from which the family could <b>not</b> <b>recover.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{missing the}} Australian {{victory in the}} Second Test due to injury, Meckiff {{returned}} for the Third Test and he was again attacked, taking 1/74 from 13 overs in the first innings, his sole victim being Conrad Hunte. He then broke down after five overs in the second innings. Davidson also left the field with injury and the tourists took advantage; they attacked the remaining bowlers, levelling the series 1–1. The Victorian did <b>not</b> <b>recover</b> {{in time for the}} rest of the Tests.|$|E
5|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and {{the closure}} of Vale Royal Abbey in 1538, St Padarn's Church regained its independence, though now solely as a parish church {{rather than as a}} {{religious}} community. The church remained important in part because the parish was {{one of the largest in}} Wales (over 240 square miles). However, although the Abbot of Vale Royal was no longer rector, the church did <b>not</b> <b>recover</b> the tithes, nor the ownership of the lands that had once belonged to the church.|$|E

5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would <b>not</b> <b>recover.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bryant's career did <b>not</b> <b>recover.</b> She {{attempted}} to stage comebacks in Eureka Springs, Arkansas in 1992, Branson, Missouri in 1994 ("People {{who come to}} my performances are hungry for the truth. They thank me for reminding them {{of the importance of}} God and country."), and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee in 1997. However, at each venue her audiences dwindled and investors were non-existent. By 2002, Bryant and her second husband Charlie Dry had claimed bankruptcy in three states. As of 2006 Bryant was living in Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|Cook was a {{consistent}} scorer {{the following two}} seasons as he recorded 33 points in 1933–34 and 34 points in 1934–35. However, he missed much of the 1935–36 season due to an arthritic condition. Believing he would <b>not</b> <b>recover,</b> the Rangers sold Cook to the Boston Bruins. The transaction broke up the Bread Line, which had been together for nine seasons. He appeared in 40 games for the Bruins in 1936–37, his final NHL season, and recorded nine points.|$|E

5|$|Fowler {{suffered}} an aggravation of a pre-existing hip {{injury in the}} 2002–03 pre-season, and did <b>not</b> <b>recover</b> until December. Struggling to gain fitness, and seeing teammates sold off due to a financial crisis, Fowler's form and market value diminished. It was despite this decrease in form that he still, in total, scored 15 goals in 31 appearances for Leeds; achieving an impressive strike rate of just less than one goal every two games. In 2002–03, Leeds finished 15th in the Premier League and a severe financial crisis was developing.|$|E
5|$|In 686 Wilfrid was {{recalled}} to Northumbria {{after the}} death of Ecgfrith in battle with the Picts. During the 680s Theodore had created two more dioceses in Northumbria, at Ripon, and at Abercorn in the Pictish kingdom, but both were short-lived. After Ecgfrith's death, Theodore wrote to the new king of Northumbria, Aldfrith, and to Æthelred, king of Mercia and the Abbess of Whitby, Ælfflæd, suggesting that an agreement be made allowing Wilfrid's return to Northumbria. Aldfrith agreed, Wilfrid returned to the north, and Bosa was removed from York. Wilfrid did <b>not</b> <b>recover</b> the whole of his previous bishopric however, as Hexham and Lindisfarne remained separate sees.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} innings at The Oval, Bradman and Ponsford {{recorded}} {{an even more}} massive partnership, this time 451runs. It had taken them {{less than a month}} to break the record they had set at Headingley; this new world record was to last 57years. Bradman's share of the stand was 244 from 271balls, and the Australian total of 701 set up victory by 562runs. For the fourth time in five series, the Ashes changed hands. England would <b>not</b> <b>recover</b> them again until after Bradman's retirement.|$|E

5|$|Pierce's health {{began to}} decline again in mid-1869; he resumed heavy {{drinking}} despite his deteriorating physical condition. He returned to Concord that September, suffering from severe cirrhosis of the liver, knowing he would <b>not</b> <b>recover.</b> A caretaker was hired; none of his family members were present in his final days. He died at 4:35am on October 8. President Grant, who later defended Pierce's service in the Mexican War, declared a day of national mourning. Newspapers across the country carried lengthy front-page stories examining Pierce's colorful and controversial career. Pierce was interred next {{to his wife and}} two of his sons in the Minot enclosure at Concord's Old North Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The Secretary of State for the French Overseas, Christian Estrosi, visited Martinique {{shortly after}} the {{hurricane}} to inspect the damage. He was joined by French Prime Minister, François Fillon on August 22 and the two surveyed the damaged to Guadeloupe and Martinique, the two hardest hit French colonies. A week after the storm hit 11,000people in Martinique were still without telephone and electricity and in the worst hit parts of southern Guadeloupe the water was still not drinkable. Banana crops in Guadeloupe, 80% of which were destroyed by Dean, will <b>not</b> <b>recover</b> until March, 2008.|$|E
5|$|According to Home Office statistics, an {{estimated}} 400businesses within {{half a mile}} (0.8km) of the blast were affected, 40% of which did <b>not</b> <b>recover.</b> The heaviest damage was sustained by the three buildings nearest the bomb: Michael House, comprising a Marks & Spencer store and a six-storey office block; Longridge House, offices for Royal and Sun Alliance, an insurance company; and the Arndale Centre, a shopping mall. Michael House was deemed beyond economic repair and demolished. Marks & Spencer {{took the opportunity to}} acquire and demolish the adjacent Longridge House, using the enlarged site for the world's biggest branch of the store. The company's fortunes changed during construction, and Selfridges subsequently co-occupied the building; Marks & Spencer leased part of the Lewis's store in the interim. The frontage of the Arndale was badly damaged and was removed in a remodelling of that part of the city centre.|$|E
