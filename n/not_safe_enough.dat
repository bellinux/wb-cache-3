5|$|Starting on 1 May, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} a three-day test at the Mugello Circuit in Italy {{ahead of the}} Spanish Grand Prix. The test gave teams the opportunity to assess major aerodynamic upgrades before racing them. HRT elected not {{to take part in}} the test, instead choosing to concentrate on establishing themselves at their new headquarters in Madrid. Both Lotus's trackside operations director Alan Permane and Red Bull Racing driver Mark Webber questioned the value of testing at the Mugello circuit as the characteristics of the circuit were unlike any of the circuits the championship was due to visit after the test, while Caterham driver Vitaly Petrov was critical of the choice of Mugello as a testing venue as he felt it was <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> for Formula One. Petrov's comments came shortly after Fernando Alonso crashed on the final morning of the test. Red Bull Racing and Lotus team principals Christian Horner and Éric Boullier were also critical of the test as they felt that the costs of conducting in-season testing outweighed any benefits, with Horner stating his opposition to continuing mid-season testing in the future.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, {{approximately}} half of the rivers, lakes, and bays under EPA oversight were <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> for fishing and swimming. The development of WQS and TMDL is a complex process, both scientifically and legally, and it is a resource-intensive process for state agencies.|$|E
25|$|The obvious {{drawback}} of {{the system}} {{is that it is not}} compatible with Europlugs. As household appliances were never sold fitted with these security plugs and the use of adaptors would defeat all of the newly introduced safety features, once this system is adopted all standard plugs must be cut off and replaced with the appropriate security connector. However, the Magic security system had some success at first because its enhanced safety features appealed to customers; standard connectors of the day were considered <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough.</b> The decline {{of the system}} occurred when safety lids similar to the Magic type were developed (VIMAR Sicury) and then applied to standard sockets by third brands and by BTicino itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{eventual}} winner, Red Marauder, was freely {{available as}} an each-way chance at 33/1 after disappointingly falling at Becher's Brook {{on the first}} circuit the previous year. Another fall at Haydock before the National had punters feeling that the horse was <b>not</b> a <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> jumper.|$|R
5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states. For example, Frontex, the new border agency, has had problems recruiting skilled experts because many {{do not want to}} live in the agency's host city, Warsaw, due to its relatively low wages and standard of living. In addition, plans to place the headquarters of Galileo in Prague met with opposition over security concerns that the city would <b>not</b> be <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> for such a sensitive agency.|$|R
50|$|On August 10, 2008, Thaksin and {{his wife}} Khunying Potjaman flew to London from Beijing, {{where he had been}} {{attending}} the 2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony. In doing so he violated the terms of his bail. Thaksin said that it was his wish to return to Thailand someday, but claimed it was <b>not</b> currently <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> for him and his family. Thaksin announced his intention to seek political asylum in Britain. His 3 children had reportedly flown ahead to Britain. Meanwhile, Thailand's Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant for both Thaksin {{and his wife}} for jumping bail.|$|R
2500|$|The {{above is}} not {{particularly}} controversial. But deciding how 25524.2 is to be construed and classified is a more difficult proposition. At the outset, we emphasize that the statute does not seek to regulate the construction or operation of a nuclear powerplant. It would clearly be impermissible for California to attempt to do so, for such regulation, even if enacted out of nonsafety concerns, would nevertheless directly conflict with the NRC's exclusive authority over plant construction and operation. Respondents appear to concede as much. Respondents do broadly argue, however, that although safety regulation of nuclear plants by States is forbidden, a State may completely prohibit new construction until its safety concerns are satisfied by the Federal Government. We reject this line of reasoning. State safety regulation is not pre-empted only when it conflicts with federal law. Rather, the Federal Government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns, except the limited powers expressly ceded to the States. 25 [...] When the Federal Government [...] completely occupies a given field or an identifiable portion of it, as it has done here, the test of pre-emption is whether [...] "the matter on which the State asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by the Federal Act." [...] Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp. 331 [...] U.S. at 236. A state moratorium on nuclear construction grounded in safety concerns falls squarely within the prohibited field. Moreover, a state judgment that nuclear power is <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> to be further developed would conflict directly with the countervailing judgment of the NRC, see, infra, at 218-219, that nuclear construction may proceed notwithstanding extant uncertainties as to waste disposal. A state prohibition on nuclear construction for safety reasons would also be {{in the teeth of}} the Atomic Energy Act's objective to insure that nuclear technology be safe enough for widespread development and use - and would be pre-empted for that reason. Infra, at 221-222.|$|E
60|$|Then Theseus laughed, and said, ‘Am I <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> now?’ And he hid {{the sword}} in his bosom, and {{rolled up the}} clue in his hand; and then he swore to Ariadne, and fell down before her, and kissed her hands and her feet; and she wept over him a long while, and then went away; and Theseus lay down and slept sweetly.|$|E
5000|$|Since the Challenger {{disaster}} in 1986 {{it had been}} recognised that the Shuttle was <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough.</b> The Study estimated its current [...] "crew survivability" [...] at 0.98. One of {{the aims of the}} Study was to increase this to 0.999.|$|E
50|$|It is theorised by both Axis and StarDrifter {{that the}} Lealfast are {{descendants}} of those Icarii {{who chose to}} flee from persecution by the Acharites in the fear that seclusion in their mountain cities would <b>not</b> be <b>safe</b> <b>enough.</b> They entered into the most northern parts of the Frozen Wastes {{and in order to}} continue as a people, Axis believes they were required to interbreed with the Skraelings. This theory is seemingly supported by BroadWing who reports ghostly Icarii flying within a storm accompanied by whispers normally associated with the Skraelings. They have also demonstrated the ability to use the Star Dance in some unknown fashion to create frost, fashion communication devices and travel long distances in an instant, despite the Timekeeper's destruction of the Star Gate.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the British Ministry of Transport, headed by Ernest Marples, {{was looking for}} a way to make {{pedestrian}} crossings safer under increasingly heavy traffic conditions. The successful zebra crossing design was <b>not</b> considered <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> for busy roads and could create traffic delays as pedestrians crossed whenever they wanted. Off-the-shelf light-controlled systems were available but were too expensive for widespread use. Some cities had innovated their own one-off crossings but the lack of standardisation was considered a safety issue. Furthermore, all existing signalled crossings tended to have two major drawbacks: stopping traffic for long periods of time and appearing to violate contemporary right-of-way law by signalling [...] "Don't cross" [...] to pedestrians (in reality: the 'Don't Cross' indication was not a legally enforceable instruction).|$|R
50|$|However, {{partially}} {{owing to}} the strict measures adopted during elections, only 100 persons with criminal records won the elections (as opposed to 206 in the previous elections). These include the elected Chief Minister Mayawati, who is facing embezzlement charges stemming from the Rs.175 crore (USD 40 million) Taj Corridor Case, {{the leader of the}} opposition Mulayam Singh Yadav, and other ganglords and hardened criminals (see Criminal-Politicians below). In many of these instances, opposition campaigners did <b>not</b> feel <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> to put up a vibrant campaign, and in some situations, the mainstream parties reached alliances with the criminals and did not put up serious competition (e.g., Mukhtar Ansari). However, to some extent, these victories may also reflect a perception that these criminal politicians are able to deliver some level of well-being to their communities.|$|R

50|$|With all {{the wisdom}} sealed in a pot, {{he was still}} {{concerned}} that it was <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough,</b> so he secretly took the pot to a tall thorny tree in the forest (in some versions the silk cotton tree).

50|$|In the {{circumstance}} {{the father and}} mother of Bangobandhu was sheltered by Moulovi Abdul Bari Biswas. But that place was <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough,</b> so they {{were taken to the}} house of Jhilu Biswas after a few days. When the war began very hardly they were sheltered in Shibchor with the help of Alam and Faruk, two members of Hemayet Force.|$|E
50|$|The {{museum has}} {{opened its doors}} on only a dozen times since September 1980 during the Iran-Iraq War. Since the invasion, it has opened only rarely, opened on July 3, 2003 for several hours for a visit by journalists and Coalition Provisional Authority head J. Paul Bremer, as a signal that things were {{returning}} to normal. In December 2008, the museum was opened for a photo opportunity for Ahmad Chalabi, who returned a number of artifacts supposedly handed in to him by Iraqis. The latest opening occurred on February 23, 2009, {{at the behest of}} Iraqi prime minister Maliki, to demonstrate that things were returning to normal. Many archaeological officials protested against this opening, arguing that conditions were <b>not</b> yet <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> to put the museum at risk; the museum's director was fired for airing her objections.|$|R
50|$|According to an Associate Professor of English at Bates College, Sylvia Federico, {{women often}} had the strongest desire to {{participate}} in revolts, especially this one in particular. These women did everything that the men did; they were just as violent, if not more, in their actions in order to rebel against the government. Johanna Ferrour {{was not the only}} female who was a leader within this revolt; there were quite a few more involved—one woman was indicted for encouraging an attack against a prison at Maidstone in Kent, while another female leader was responsible for the robbing of a multitude of mansions, which frightened servants so much that they did <b>not</b> feel <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> to return afterwards. Although there were not many female leaders within this rebellion, there was a surprisingly large amount of women who were a part of the crowd. For instance, there were seventy female rebels in Suffolk.|$|R
50|$|The track {{ran into}} {{economic}} problems {{very early in}} its life. The organiser went bankrupt in 1974. They were however able to find enough sponsors to organise that year's Formula One race. In 1976 it was once again Nivelles's turn to organise the Belgian Grand Prix, but the track was <b>not</b> considered <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> for Formula One because of {{the condition of the}} tarmac. By 1980 the circuit was deemed too dangerous for car racing, but motorcycle events continued until 1981. When the circuit licence expired on June 30, 1981, the track was finally closed for good. Until the late 1990s the pit buildings and the circuit were left abandoned, and it was possible to drive illegal laps around the track. However, in the early 21st century the track was demolished and is now a part of an industrial estate, but it is still possible to see traces of the circuit.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} track was very sharp {{due to the}} nature of the bend design around the {{football}} pitch corners and this led to criticism within the industry that it was <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough.</b> Despite this a Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) contract was established at the track. The final race meeting took place on 30 October 1978. The last winner was a greyhound called Chad Supreme.|$|E
50|$|In September 1944 Seki was {{transferred}} to Tainan, a city in Taiwan. He had to leave his wife behind because Tainan was <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> {{for them to go}} together. Mariko followed Seki to Yokohama to say goodbye to him. Three weeks after he had arrived in Tainan he {{was transferred}} again, this time to the 201st flotilla in Philippines as leader of 301st fighter unit. Their base was originally in Nicholas, but was later moved to Mabalacat away from increasing attacks by the Americans.|$|E
50|$|With {{its first}} game in {{franchise}} history slated for September 14, 2013, the debut was rescheduled for October 5. This was due to concerns from all the {{teams in the league}} not being adequately prepared. In early September, it was confirmed that eight players and volunteers had stepped away. There were safety concerns as equipment was supposedly received only two weeks before their planned September debut. Complaints included that the equipment were used shoulder pads and helmets. Concerns existed over the gear being too light and <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> and could cause concussions.|$|E
5000|$|As part {{of plans}} to {{renovate}} Lime Street, Liverpool Council {{determined that the}} building was too badly derelict to save, with parts of the building <b>not</b> even <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> for structural engineers investigating the building to enter. A report published in March 2015 by Sutcliffe found that the building's structure was largely corroded and rotting due to water damage from the roof, though concluded that the facade may be salvageable. Renovations for Lime Street, including demolition of the Futurist, were approved in August 2015. [...] This followed a number of campaigns that took place attempting to save the building's facade in the preceding years, firstly by local Facebook campaigners whose petition generated 4,015 signatories [...] and later by the Merseyside Civic Society and SAVE [...] After an independent engineer stated {{that there was a}} possibility the facade could be saved, campaigners were granted the right to appeal in May 2016.|$|R
5000|$|The city of Geelong, {{close to}} Torquay, {{experiences}} great benefit from Australian and international {{visitors to the}} road; with Geelong Otway Tourism affirming it as an invaluable asset. [...] The Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) listed the road as the state's top tourism experience in its Victoria 101 survey, based on spots recommended by members and the public on what they would recommend to visitors. [...] However, {{according to a survey}} performed by the Surf Coast Shire, residents have expressed concern that there are <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>safe</b> crossings along the road.|$|R
25|$|Globally, around 1.4 million {{symptomatic}} cases occur {{each year}} and about 114 million infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic).

In the developing world, about 90% of children have been infected by age 10, thus are immune by adulthood. It often occurs in outbreaks in moderately developed countries where children are not exposed when young and vaccination is not widespread. Acute hepatitis A resulted in 11,200 deaths in 2015. World Hepatitis Day occurs each year on July 28 to bring awareness to viral hepatitis.|$|R

50|$|The book opens {{immediately}} after the Battle of Bosworth on August 22, 1485 (a scanning error in the Dodo Press 2000 edition gives the date as 1415). Three knights are fleeing from the battle, Sir Henry Stafford, Lord Lovel, and Edmund Plantagent, although the latter two are not identified until they split from Stafford and arrive at a church. All three {{are members of the}} defeated Yorkist contingency. With the aid of John de la Poole, the Earl of Lincoln, Lovel and Edumund are involved in spiriting away Richard, Duke of York into the hands of Mynheer Jahn Warbeck, a Flemish moneylender who had previously housed him and pretended that Richard was his deceased son, Perkin Warbeck. This is <b>not</b> considered <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> for the youth at the present time, so it is arranged for Richard to go with Madeline de Faro, Warbeck's 25-year-old sister. Madeline is married to mariner Hernan de Faro, and the two have a daughter named Monina, and Richard and Monina develop a strong sibling bond, Richard aware he could never marry a commoner. It is she who rescues and nurses him back to health after his first taste of battle in the Granada War.|$|R
50|$|In March 2009, SNERDI {{announced}} that it was proceeding with design of CHASNUPP-III and IV, with China Zhongyuan Engineering as the general contractor. The PAEC said Beijing was financing 85% of the US$1.6 billion project. Contracts for CHASNUPP-I and II were signed in 1990 and 2000, before 2004 when China joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which maintains an embargo on sales of nuclear equipment to Pakistan, but there are questions about China's supply of Chasma-3 and 4. On 24 September 2010, China informed the IAEA that it will implement an agreement with Pakistan on the export of two nuclear reactors for Islamabad's Chashma nuclear complex. Beijing has said that the reactor deal is part of a 2003 agreement between the two countries, a claim many have questioned, though Germany has accepted. These will be the third and fourth reactors at the complex. According to the Chinese communication to the IAEA, the reactors will be placed under international safeguards. Concerns have been expressed over the lack the safety features incorporated into the Chashma-3 and Chashma-4 reactors, which are alleged to use a design which is <b>not</b> considered <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> to build in China.|$|R
5000|$|The {{plight of}} several {{thousands}} or {{tens of thousands}} of people living in rooftop slums is gaining media attention, but there are still <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>safe,</b> affordable housing options for Hong Kong's citizens. Because there is an inadequate supply of housing, removing people from their rooftop dwellings isn't a viable option. So, the Hong Kong government has few options in the short term. Social worker Sze Lai-Shan, who works for the Society for Community Organization and has urged the government to provide more public rental housing, said: [...] The government doesn't know much about this and they don’t bother to know because they don’t have a rehousing policy for these people... They don’t want to make them (the rooftop dwellers) homeless, so they let them stay. Sze Lai-Shan ...|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, {{checking}} the pressure {{as a condition}} to opening an autoclave is simply <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough.</b> Particularly with industrial size autoclaves, such as those used in the rubber industry, {{it is critical that}} the autoclave be opened only after checking both the pressure and temperature gauges. If water inside an autoclave has managed to become superheated, the pressure gauge may not indicate the presence of steam even though the temperature may be significantly higher than the local boiling point for water. If the autoclave is opened in this state and the superheated water is disturbed, a steam explosion becomes possible. This phenomenon can easily produce fatal burns to people {{in the vicinity of the}} explosion. Often, victims die only after a painful agony sometimes lasting as long as a month.|$|E
50|$|Nearly {{two months}} after the third round, the European season began in Spain at the very fast Montjuic street circuit in Barcelona. The Grand Prix Drivers Association was not happy with the state of the barriers, which were not bolted properly, and the drivers {{threatened}} not to take part. Mechanics from the teams went around the entire circuit to attempt to repair/fasten down the barriers. After work was done on the circuit, the drivers agreed that the circuit was still <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough.</b> Reigning world champion and championship leader Emerson Fittipaldi had no intention to race because of the condition of the barriers, and went home on Sunday morning. The organisers of the event then locked the cars and motorhomes inside the circuit confines for breach of contract and threatened to keep them there. This being incompatible with the timeschedule for the next race at Monaco, the teams decided to cater for the organisers wishes and raced anyway.|$|E
5000|$|The device {{paradigm}} can {{be illustrated}} through comparison of a wood-burning stove, a [...] "thing", versus the {{central heating system}}, a [...] "device". The central heating system derives its technological qualities {{from the fact that}} it is easy to use, safe to operate, ubiquitous, and the user generally needs to understand little of the way in which the system operates. The wood-burning stove, on the other hand, takes more skill in its operation in that it requires wood to be chopped beforehand, and prepared for use in the stove. The act of lighting the fire is <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> to be done by, for example, a child, and requires a degree of vigilance over its operation. The stove is not ubiquitous because it orients the senses and commands attention for its user throughout the time of its operation. It also requires some knowledge of how the stove works in order to make successful use of it.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, Ching-Ling {{returned}} to China, {{just in time}} to see the republic collapse under the leadership of Yuan Shikai.

They remained there until 1916, when Charlie deemed the situation in Shanghai to be <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> to return.|$|R
5000|$|The circuit {{was used}} over 1-3 May, for the in-season test during the 2012 Formula One season, by all teams except HRT. The track was praised by Mark Webber, who {{stated that he}} [...] "did 10 dry laps today around Mugello, {{which is the same}} as doing 1000 laps around Abu Dhabi track in terms of satisfaction". Four-time Formula One world {{champion}} Sebastian Vettel was impressed too, saying that “unfortunately we don’t have this track on the calendar. It’s an incredible circuit with a lot of high-speed corners”. On the other hand, Vitaly Petrov from Caterham F1 complained that [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> and wide <b>enough.</b> If you lose it, the walls are so close and you will smash into the tyres. It is not for Formula 1 and, if you lost the steering or the tyre pressure dropped or whatever, then it will be a big crash." [...] Nevertheless, it holds a grade 1 FIA license, meaning it meets the standards to host a Formula 1 race. An unofficial track record of 1:21.035 was set by Romain Grosjean during the test.|$|R
