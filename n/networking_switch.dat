40|$|This paper proposes an auto-configuration {{mechanism}} for a newly attached SDN (Software-defined <b>Networking)</b> <b>switch</b> and intermediate switches in an SDN/non-SDN hybrid network. Automation of initial configuration of SDN switches brings {{the benefit of}} reducing the installation costs and maintaining the operational consistency in an enterprise network. However, the heterogeneity of a hybrid network introduces difficulty in achieving such benefits. The proposed system achieves the following features: 1) detecting a new SDN switch in a hybrid network, 2) providing the switch with appropriate configuration parameters in an SDN/non-SDN hybrid network and 3) ensuring seamless service across the SDN and non-SDN segments. The proposed solution also introduces DHCP-SDN {{as an extension of}} Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to support SDN parameters. The proposed system enables a new SDN switch to automatically start operating even though the intermediate switches are not configured with the SDN-specific VLAN setup...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Applications on cloud {{infrastructures}} acquire vir-tual machines (VMs) from providers when necessary. The current interface for acquiring VMs {{from most}} providers, however, is too limiting for the tenants, {{in terms of}} granularity in which VMs can be acquired (e. g., small, medium, large, etc.), while giving very limited control over their placement. The former leads to VM underutilization, and the latter has performance implications, both translating into higher costs for the tenants. In this work, we leverage nested virtualization and a networking overlay to tackle these problems. We present Kangaroo, an OpenStack-based virtual infrastructure provider, and IPOPsm, a virtual <b>networking</b> <b>switch</b> for communication between nested VMs over different infrastructure VMs. In addition, we design and implement Skippy, the realization of our proposed virtual infrastructure API for programming Kangaroo. Our benchmarks show that through careful mapping of nested VMs to infrastruc-ture VMs, Kangaroo achieves up to {{an order of magnitude}} better performance, with only half the cost on Amazon EC 2. Further, Kangaroo’s unified OpenStack API allows us to migrate an entire application between Amazon EC 2 and our local OpenNebula deployment within a few minutes, without any downtime or modification to the application code.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{relative}} effects between {{the relevance of}} capabilities in innovation and that in commercialization on the timing of ‘fast-second’ entry. For the established firms that miss the opportunity to pioneer an emerging market, becoming fast-second movers presents an opportunity to transform a niche market into a mass market. We develop a theoretical framework {{as well as an}} empirical apparatus to examine how potential entrants can gain control on the rate of market entry. Specifically, we argue that the process of deliberate learning with respect to the pioneers enhances the rate of becoming a fast-second mover. We test our hypotheses with a panel of 224 potential entrants that were established prior to the emergence of the <b>networking</b> <b>switch</b> market. The results show that the relevance of capabilities in innovation and that in commercialization each has a positive effect on entry rate, but the latter is the dominant one between the two. As the capabilities become reconfigured with respect to the frontier of market entry, the relevance in commercialization arises as the most important determinant of entry rate. The relative effects as well as the process of deliberate learning with respect to a comparison group have important implications on capability reconfiguration, market diversity, and strategic renewal...|$|E
