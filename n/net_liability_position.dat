40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the path of}} the UK's international investment position (IIP) {{with the rest of the}} world. The paper shows that both UK assets and liabilities grew considerably during the past decade. Liabilities always outstripped assets during this period, mainly reflecting the persistent current account deficits, which meant that the UK consistently ran a <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> <b>position.</b> Although the size of the <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> increased over the decade, its growth has been volatile. The paper presents a model which shows that in the long term flows had driven the changes to the UK’s net IIP, while the volatility in the short term was driven by other changes. The model showed that in 2008 exchange rate effects were the main driver of the UK’s improved net liability position; this was because sterling depreciated sharply against all three major currencies. The deterioration in the <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> in 2009 and 2010 was explained mainly in terms of price effects, as equity markets began to recover; but also exchange rate effects as sterling began to rally, particularly against the euro; and flows as investors turned to UK gilts in preference to euro denominated government debt...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} Investment Position (IPP) is {{a statement}} that shows the value of external financial assets and liabilities of residents of an economy {{at a point in}} time. Its evolution {{at the end of a}} specific period reflects balance of payments financial account transactions, valuation changes (in asset prices and exchange rates) and other adjustments, which consist mainly of reclassifications of external financial assets and liabilities. The purpose of this paper is to provide figures on trends of valuation adjustments due to price and exchange rate changes implicit in Spain´s International Investment Position (IIP), and to briefly analyze their limitations. We found that valuation effects depend on the characteristics of the financial instruments involved, and on the sources of information available for each component. In the case of portfolio investment transactions, we used security by security market prices that were available for the years 2003 and 2004. Additionally, in Spain´s international investment position, most foreign direct investment data are not available at market values. As these assets and liabilities have experienced important price increases between 1993 and 2006, we present a new methodology for measuring foreign direct investment positions that includes valuation effects. The results presented in this paper show that in Spain, revaluations of stocks explain a very important part of changes in the IIP during recent years: 55 % of the increase in the <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> of the Spanish economy between 1993 and 2004 reflects changes of value due to variations in prices or in exchange rates of external assets and liabilities. Overall, the sum of these revaluation effects represent 19 % of GDP of the year 2004. Between 1997 and 2004, Spain’s <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> increased 247, 930 million euros, of which balance of payments financial account transactions accounted for 52, 6 %, whereas revaluations and other adjustments explain the remaining 47, 3 %. The latter is broken own into 27, 6 % due to price effects, 10, 1 % to exchange rate changes, and 9, 6 % to other adjustments. ...|$|E
40|$|Although the United States {{has seen}} its net {{liabilities}} surge in recent years, its investment income balance has remained positive—largely because U. S. firms operating abroad earn {{a higher rate of}} return than do foreign firms operating here. The continuing buildup in liabilities, however, should soon push the U. S. income balance below zero. In that event, net income flows will begin to boost the nation’s current account deficit instead of reducing it. Years of large current account deficits have left the United States with the world’s largest stock of international liabilities. By the end of 2004, foreign net claims on the United States amounted to $ 2. 5 trillion, equivalent to 22 percent of U. S. GDP. Normally, such a large <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> would require substantial investment income payments {{to the rest of the}} world. Yet the reverse is true for the United States.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{determinants}} of gross capital flows, project the size of China’s international investment positions in 2020 and analyse the implications for the renminbi real exchange rates. We assume in this exercise that the renminbi will have largely achieved capital account convertibility {{by the end of}} this decade, a timetable consistent with recent proposals by the People’s Bank of China. Our analysis shows that China’s gross international investment positions would grow significantly, and inflows and outflows would become much more balanced. The private sector would turn its <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> into a balanced position, and the official sector would reduce its net asset position significantly, relative to the country’s GDP. Because of the increasing importance of private sector foreign claims and the decreasing importance of official foreign reserves, China would be able to earn higher net investment incomes from abroad. Overall, China would continue to be a net creditor, with the net foreign asset position as a share of GDP remaining largely stable through this decade. These findings suggest that the renminbi real exchange rate would not be particularly sensitive to capital account liberalisation as capital flows are expected to be two-sided. The renminbi real exchange rate would likely be on a path of moderate appreciation as China is expected to maintain a sizeable growt...|$|E
40|$|Sustained large U. S. {{current account}} deficits have led some economists and policymakers {{to worry that}} future current account {{adjustment}} could occur through a sudden and disruptive depreciation of the dollar and {{a sharp drop in}} U. S. consumption. Two factors that, to date, have cast doubt on such concerns are the stability of U. S. net external liabilities and the minimal net income payments made by the United States on these liabilities. We show that the stability of the external position reflects sizable capital gains stemming from strong foreign equity markets and a weaker dollar - conditions that could be reversed in the future. We also show that while minimal U. S. net income payments reflect a much higher measured rate of return on U. S. foreign direct investment (FDI) assets than on U. S. FDI liabilities, ongoing borrowing is likely to overwhelm this favorable rate of return, pushing the U. S. net income balance more deeply into deficit.; In addition, we review the argument that the United States holds large amounts of intangible assets not captured in the data - assets that would bring the true U.

40|$|The Australian {{economy has}} proven {{resilient}} to sizable {{exchange rate fluctuations}} over the post-float period. In part this {{can be attributed to}} financial institutions and non-financial firms learning to adapt to swings in the Australian dollar.

This paper examines the available evidence on {{the nature and extent of}} this hedging behaviour. Related to this, Australia’s <b>net</b> foreign <b>liability</b> <b>position</b> is often cited as a vulnerability of the Australian economy to exchange rate depreciation.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} on the adjustment dynamics of the US <b>net</b> foreign <b>liabilities,</b> <b>net</b> output and consumption. We use empirical techniques {{that allow us to}} quantify the relative importance of permanent and transitory innovations. We find that transitory shocks contribute considerably to the variation in all three variables for a horizon up to a year, and their contribution remains significant for a horizon up to five years. A permanent shock – that we interpret as a technological shock – dominates the variation of all variables at longer horizons. In response to this shock, <b>net</b> foreign <b>liabilities,</b> <b>net</b> output and consumption all increase – consistent with the effect of productivity gains raising domestic return to capital and thus generating an inflow of foreign capital. Conversely, shocks that cause net output and consumption to increase temporarily are accompanied by short-run accumulation of net foreign assets – in contrast with traditional model predicting procyclical current account deficits in response to temporary output fluctuations. Instead, our results are qualitatively consistent with predictions of the intertemporal approach to the current account. consumption smoothing; current account; international adjustment mechanism; intertemporal approach to the current account; net foreign wealth; permanent-transitory decomposition...|$|R

After {{a brief description of the}} 1997 / 1998 reform of the Hungarian pension system, we present results from simulations with a revised pension model. Our results show that 1) the pension system, in its present form, is unsustainable with <b>net</b> implicit public <b>liabilities</b> in the system around 240 % of GDP, unless corrective measures are taken. 2) The series of policy measures taken since the 1997 / 1998 reform account for nearly three-fourths of the <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> implicit in the pension system, reflecting a policy reversal: an alarming tendency of undoing the progress made by the reform in terms of improving the system’s sustainability. 3) The funded pillar can help in lowering <b>net</b> implicit <b>liabilities</b> if the transition costs involved in the reform are financed by budgetary adjustment. 4) The returns recorded so far in the private pension funds fall short of expectations and, on the condition that these low returns persist, the second pillar is projected to provide annuities that do not make up for the reduction in benefits received from the public pillar. This conclusion is valid even if we compare a hypothetical balanced full pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system with a sustainable multi-pillar system. ageing, pension system, social security, fiscal sustainability. ...|$|R
