The Great forkbeard, Phycis blennoides (Brünnich, 1768), is {{a species}} widely {{distributed throughout the}} Mediterranean Sea and although it is of great importance for fishing industry, {{little is known about}} its reproductive characteristics. This study provides first data on reproductive characteristics of this species in the south western Mediterranean, important for management and stock assessment. For this purpose a total of 461 individuals ranging from 17. 5 to 43. 5 cm in total length were collected monthly in a period of one year using trammel <b>nets.</b> <b>Sex</b> ratio of males to females was 1 : 0. 91.

40|$|Student PaperSex ratio {{theory has}} led to {{numerous}} studies that both support current ideas and investigate and explain deviations from the expected 1 : 1 male to female tertiary sex ratio. Crustaceans {{have been shown to}} have aberrant sex ratios (Wenner 1972). This study tests the hypothesis that these results apply to crayfish species. In this study native (O. virilis) and invasive (O. rusticus) species were sampled in Burt Lake in Cheboygan County, Michigan to determine the sex ratios of both populations. Crayfish were captured at 4 sites using dip <b>nets</b> and <b>sex</b> and species were visually determined by examination of the genital pore and color indicators. Carapace length and total length were also measured. The chi-squared tests of the data showed a statistically significant deviation from expected 1 : 1 sex ratios for O. virilis. In this case there was a female bias with 52 female individuals to only 20 male individuals. O. rusticus samples did not differ significantly from the expected sex ratio. This sex ratio bias in O. virilis could be the result of differential movement or mortality as well as interactions between native and invasive crayfish species...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the social network}} procedure of cohesive blocking (Moody & White 2003) as a strategy for fine-grained quantitative network analysis in sociolinguistics. In Raleigh, North Carolina, the Southern Vowel Shift is reversing, {{due in part to}} large-scale migration from outside the South since the mid- 20 th century. Acoustic analysis of the five front vowels from a 140 -speaker subset of the conversational Raleigh corpus reveals steady change across apparent time. The community's network structure is considered via a bipartite, or two-mode, network of schools and individuals. Cohesive blocking generates a network hierarchy in which individuals are "nested " at different levels. Nestedness is then tested as a predictor of linguistic variation in linear mixed effects models, which reveal significant nestedness effects for three of the five vowels, <b>net</b> of age, <b>sex,</b> and occupation. Speakers with higher nestedness lead the retreat from the Southern Vowel Shift...|$|R

The already published various methods are synthesized in a complex model for measurement and factor analysis of ageing. The novice here is the further development of factor model. In that method a hipothetical population with preserved intensities of the three processes - age-specific fertility rates of women, mortality and <b>net</b> migration by <b>sex</b> and age from a previous period – is established. At these conditions two tasks of factor analysis are solved. In the first one, ageing is divided in two parts – by the three processes’ preserved intensities and by their changes in surveyed period. In the second task ageing is subdivided in three parts - by change {{in the number of}} live births and by the different intensities of mortality and net migration by age in accounted period.

5000|$|While hunting, the Bambuti {{have been}} known to {{specifically}} target the giant forest hog. The meat obtained from the giant forest hog (as is the meat from rats) is often considered kweri, a bad animal which may cause illness to those who eat it, but is often valuable as a trade good between the Bambuti and agriculturalist Bantu groups. There is some lore that is thought to have identified giant forest hogs as kweri due to their nocturnal habits and penchant for disruption of the few agricultural advances the Bambuti have made. This lore can be tied to Bambuti mythology, where the giant forest hog is thought to be a physical manifestation of Negoogunogumbar. Further, there are unconfirmed reports of giant forest hogs eating Bambuti infants from their cribs in the night. Other food sources yielded by the forest are non-kweri animals for meat consumption, root plants, palm trees, and bananas; and in some seasons, wild honey. Yams, legumes, beans, peanuts, hibiscus, amaranth, and gourds are consumed. The Bambuti use large nets, traps, and bows and arrows to hunt game. Women and children sometimes assist in the hunt by driving the prey into the <b>nets.</b> Both <b>sexes</b> gather and forage. Each band has its own hunting ground, although boundaries are hard to maintain. The Mbuti call the forest [...] "mother" [...] and [...] "father" [...] as the mood seizes them, because, like their parents, the forest gives them food, shelter and clothing, which are readily made from abundant forest materials.|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{maintenance}} of sexual reproduction constitutes a difficult problem for evolutionary biologists because of the immediate costs that sex seems to incur. Typically, general benefits to sex and recombination are investigated that might outweigh these costs. However, several factors can strongly influence the complex balance between {{costs and benefits of}} sex; these include constraints on the evolution of asexuality, ecological differentiation, and certain life-history traits. We review these factors and their empirical support {{for the first time in}} a unified framework and find that they can reduce the costs of sex, circumvent them, or make them inapplicable. These factors can even tip the scales to a <b>net</b> benefit for <b>sex.</b> The reviewed factors affect species and species groups differently, and we conclude consequently that understanding {{the maintenance}} of sex could turn out to be more species-specific than commonly assumed. Interestingly, our study suggests that, in some species, no general benefits to sex and recombination might be needed to understand {{the maintenance of}} sex, as in our case study of dandelions...|$|R

It is a useful {{location}} as Mount Solaro is an important stop for migratory birds that nest in Europe and fly to Africa for the winter. The station was started by the Italian League for Bird Protection in the early 1980s and was subsequently continued by the Ringing Centre of the Institute for the Protection and Environmental Research of Bologna. In order to facilitate their study, migratory birds are caught in a <b>net,</b> classified by <b>sex,</b> age and species, and then weighed and measured.

Each bird is then ringed for future monitoring, {{with a view to}} discovering its travels and place of origin. The Swedish experts are attached to the bird station on the island of Öland and although they initially concentrated on spring and autumn migrations, they are now involved in specific projects such as the birds' aptitude for orientation during the longest migrations and the causes of diseases transmitted by birds as well as studies on the migration of butterflies.|$|R

The {{influence}} of various sex ratios and stocking densities on hatchery production of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus L., was studied in land-based (concrete tanks) and lake-based (hapa nets) systems. In both hatchery systems, egg and fry production {{was maximum at}} a sex ratio of 4 : 1 females to males and a density of 4 females per m 2. Seed production varied significantly among treatments at different periods of the year. In concrete tanks, significantly high seed production of 12. 98 and 11. 77 eggs and fry per spawner per day was obtained in March and August, respectively. In hapa <b>nets,</b> irrespective of <b>sex</b> ratios, 10. 18 seeds per spawner were collected daily in March. In relation to the broodstock density in concrete tanks, significantly bigger daily harvests of 13. 41 and 13. 00 eggs and fry per spawner were produced in late February and March, respectively. In hapa nets, daily harvests of 8. 95 and 7. 74 eggs and fry per spawner were the highest seed production levels which occurred in April and March, respectively. Seed production was significantly higher in concrete tanks than in hapa nets while insignificant differences (P> 0. 05) were found among sex ratio and broodstock density treatments...|$|R
40|$|Both {{theory and}} {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated that}} sex can facilitate adaptation, potentially yielding a group-level advantage to sex. However, {{it is unclear whether}} this process can help solve the more difficult problem of the maintenance of sex within populations. Using experimental populations of the facultatively sexual rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, we show that rates of sex evolve to higher levels during adaptation but then decline as fitness plateaus. To assess the fitness consequences of genetic mixing, we directly compare the fitnesses of sexually and asexually derived genotypes that naturally occur in our experimental populations. Sexually derived genotypes are more fit than asexually derived genotypes when adaptive pressures are strong, but this pattern reverses as the pace of adaptation slows, matching the pattern of evolutionary change in the rate of sex. These fitness assays test the <b>net</b> effect of <b>sex</b> but cannot be used to disentangle whether selection on sex arises because highly sexual lineages become associated with different allele combinations or with different allele frequencies than less sexual lineages (i. e., "short-" or "long-term" effects, respectively). We infer which of these mechanisms provides an advantage to sex by performing additional manipulations to obtain fitness distributions of sexual and asexual progeny arrays from unbiased parents (rather than from naturally occurring, and thereby evolutionarily biased, parents). We find evidence that sex breaks down adaptive gene combinations, resulting in lower average fitness of sexual progeny (i. e., a short-term disadvantage to sex). As predicted by theory, the advantage to sex arises because sexually derived progeny are more variable in fitness, allowing for faster adaptation. This "long-term advantage" builds over multiple generations, eventually resulting in higher fitness of sexual types...|$|R
40|$|The {{sex ratio}} theory {{proposed}} by Fisher (1930) that suggests {{an equal number}} of males to females has ignited an interest in studying the sex ratio of various organisms. In particular, this study looked at the tertiary sex ratio of two species of crayfish found in Northern Michigan. Native (Orconectes virilis) and invasive species (Orconectes rusticus) of crayfish were collected from Burt Lake in Cheboygan County, Michigan during a two-week period in mid-July. Crayfish were sampled at four different sites along the Burt Lake shoreline and were caught by dip <b>nets.</b> The species, <b>sex,</b> carapace length, and total length were determined for each individual. A total of 163 crayfish were caught and by looking at the total length of each crayfish, only 137 of them were of reproductive age. The 26 crayfish not of reproductive age {{were not included in the}} data analysis. The data showed that O. rusticus and O. virilis were present in nearly equal amounts, 47 % and 53 % respectively. For O. rusticus, 39 females and 26 males were collected for a total of 65 invasive crayfish. For O. virilis, 72 crayfish were collected with 52 females and 20 males. The data were analyzed by chi-squared tests. Based on the statistical analysis, the data collected for O. rusticus did not show significant bias from a normal sex ratio. However, the data for O. virilis was significant. The number of females was substantially higher than the number of males in the population. External factors like differential mortality or differential movement that might be influencing the sex ratio bias of O. virilis will be discusse...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation thesis {{creates a}} complex and modern scheme for {{stochastic}} modeling of demographic processes, which is universally applicable to any population in the world. All calculations are described in detail on the data of the Czech Republic. Throughout the work the attention is drawn to the issues, that every analyst must necessarily take into account {{in order to obtain}} correct results. Data comes mostly from the Czech Statistical Office database. However, some data matrices had to be calculated {{for the purposes of the}} thesis. Particular demographic processes (mortality, fertility and migration) are modeled using selected modern approaches (ARIMA models, Lee-Carter method) and based on the constructed models these processes are forecasted to the future. Using partially projected results a comprehensive demographic projection of the population of the Czech Republic is created up to the year 2050. However, not on the basis of the current state and expert expectations of the future development, but based on sophistically projected demographic events, which are explained using the trends and main components of their previous development. This demographic projection is created in three scenarios (marked SC 1, SC 2 and SC 3), which are made from selected optimal models, presented in particular sections of the work. One part of the thesis is also the backward retropolation of age-specific number of <b>net</b> migrants by <b>sex</b> in the Czech Republic since 1948. On its basis the analysis and prediction of the migration can be done. The thesis is a synthesis of the projections of demographic processess of mortality, fertility, and migration. Final results are confronted with three scenarios of population projections of the Czech Republic created by the Czech Statistical Office and five scenarios of population projections by Eurostat. The purely statistical approach of demographic forecasting in comparison with deterministic models and expert expectations has its positives and negatives. Therefore, the different results due to various methodological approaches are discussed and compared in the conclusion of the thesis...|$|R
40|$|Like {{many other}} {{important}} opportunistic human fungal pathogens, {{for more than}} a century Candida albicans was thought to be strictly asexual until a parasexual cycle was recently discovered in the laboratory. It is uncertain, however, whether sex is still a viable reproductive strategy for C. albicans. In this study I tested whether or not mating enhanced survival of parental genes in this yeast, by mating 10 clinical isolates and testing recombinants’ fitness. Clinical isolates of C. albicans usually are diploid, carrying both the MTLa and MTLα mating type alleles, each on a different copy of chromosome 5. These strains are apparently incapable of meiosis and cannot mate with each other, because the a 1 -α 2 heterodimer suppresses mating. Through selection on sorbose-containing agar I induced loss of MTL-heterozygosity and generated 5 MTLa and 5 MTLα derivatives of clinical isolates. Existing mating techniques involve the use of auxotrophic markers, requiring time-consuming sequential disruption of two copies of biosynthetic genes if wild-type clinical isolates are to be mated. Furthermore, auxotrophy affects the virulence of a strain, and this can potentially interfere with comparing the fitness of recombinants with that of their parents. I therefore developed a method for mating clinical isolates marked with two drug resistance markers, the mycophenolic acid (MPA) resistance-conferring allele of IMH 3 and the nourseothricin (NAT) resistance gene CaNAT 1, allowing selection of recombinants on the basis of resistance to both agents. I marked all MTLa strains with the MPA resistance gene and all MTLα strains with the NAT resistance gene. This allowed 25 combinations for mating. Recombinants were obtained from 15 combinations of 9 strains. It was found that not all C. albicans clinical isolates could mate. Using growth rate as the criterion, I tested the fitness of clinical isolates, MTLhomozygous derivatives with and without resistance markers and recombinants during adaptation to a novel environment (YPD medium), maximizing the potential benefits of sex. After computationally correcting for the impact of experimental manipulations, I calculated the <b>net</b> benefit of <b>sex</b> as the difference in the number of offspring from two cells that become mating competent and engage in sex compared to the offspring they could have produced by continued clonal reproduction. My results indicated that, as a rule, engaging in sex reduces the chances of survival of C. albicans’ genes, in part because MTL homozygosis significantly reduced growth rates. Through fitness increase after recombination, sex may eventually confer a net benefit for some strain combinations in the laboratory, but this probably occurs too late to prevent elimination of recombinants by competition and genetic drift in nature. Sex in C. albicans therefore diminished parents’ chances to pass on their genes to future generations. These findings have a significant impact on the assessment of the role of sex in C. albicans and other “asexual” human fungal pathogens. Recent loss of the function of sex and incomplete decay of the sex machinery are the most likely explanation of C. albicans’s residual ability to mate, and one that also needs to be considered in other fungal pathogens...|$|R
