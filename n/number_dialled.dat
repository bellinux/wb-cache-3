50|$|The SIP URI {{scheme is}} a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) {{multimedia}} communications protocol. A SIP address is a URI that addresses a specific telephone extension on a voice over IP system. Such a number {{could be a}} private branch exchange or an E.164 telephone <b>number</b> <b>dialled</b> through a specific gateway. The scheme was defined in RFC 3261.|$|E
50|$|When {{the call}} {{arrives at the}} Visited MSC, the MSRN is used to {{determine}} which of the phones {{in this area is}} being called, that is the MSRN maps back to the IMSI of the original phone <b>number</b> <b>dialled.</b> The MSC pages all the mobile phone masts in the area that the IMSI is registered in order to inform the phone that there is an incoming call for it. If the subscriber answers, a speech path is created through the Visiting MSC and Gateway MSC back to the network of the person making the call, and a normal telephone call follows.|$|E
50|$|Holborn {{exchange}} had 9400 subscribers (lines) and had 222 directors, each {{of which}} would on average handle 72 calls in the busy hour (BH) and be held for 20 seconds. Holborn was also a tandem exchange for calls to and from local manual exchanges, so that the tandem traffic from manual exchanges was combined with traffic from automatic exchanges. Handling local calls between manual exchanges via a third operator at a tandem exchange is uneconomic, but without tandem switching each manual exchange would require direct junctions to every other manual exchange. In London there were 73 manual exchanges within 10 mi of Oxford Circus, of which twennty had CCI (Coded-Call Indicator) equipment which displayed the <b>number</b> <b>dialled</b> to the local manual exchange operator, and the rest were to be equipped shortly.|$|E

50|$|This also {{affected}} international {{calls from the}} rest of the world, because carriers using least-cost routing, especially in the United States, routed calls to Gibraltar via Spain, which prevented calls dialled using the +350 code from terminating in Gibraltar. Consequently, the caller would hear a recorded announcement saying that the <b>number</b> <b>dialled</b> did not exist. Even when calls routed via Spain were allowed to terminate in Gibraltar, under the 'sender keeps all' arrangement, Telefónica in Spain was able to keep revenue from these calls, instead of paying Gibtelecom's international termination charges. Although all other countries and territories recognised the +350 dialling code, not all networks blocked calls to Gibraltar from being made using Spain's +34 9567 code, which allowed subscribers to call Gibraltar for the cost of a call to Spain.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, most call-through access {{services}} use non-geographic revenue share 0843, 0844, 0871 and 0872 numbers or premium rate 0905, 0906 and 0911 numbers. The revenue share or [...] "service charge" [...] {{part of the}} price paid is set by the terminating telecoms company. This in turn depends on the exact <b>number</b> <b>dialled.</b> The lowest rates are on 084 numbers, higher on 087 numbers and the highest rates are on 09 numbers. In {{a small number of}} cases, the [...] "service charge" [...] may vary based on the time of the day. Prices also vary according to the [...] "access charge" [...] added by the originating telecoms company. Additionally, the access charge levied on a call from a mobile telephone will be a lot more than from a landline.|$|E
50|$|A {{few weeks}} later, Jordan returns and reveals that Trina is in court. Trina later tells Lucas and Denise {{that she has}} agreed to a divorce and was in court to start proceedings. Jordan also gives her a {{bracelet}} and she promises {{not to take it}} off until she dies. A few weeks later, Trina turns up on Jordan's birthday. She gives Jordan a phone as a birthday present. She then goes to the bathroom, where she takes drugs. When she comes down she starts behaving erratically and Lucas threatens to throw her out. When she throws Jordan's phone across the room, Lucas throws her out. Outside, Trina tries to goad Denise into a fight. The following day, Trina meets up with Lucas and begs him for money but he refuses to give it to her. Trina later tries to embarrass Lucas in front of his perisioners but he throws her out. She later calls round to the house and asks Lucas if she can have a shower. Lucas reluctantly agrees. Trina comes down topless and Lucas gives into her and they sleep together. The following day, Lucas regrets his actions and leaves a message on Trina's phone to say it shouldn't have happened. Trina calls round to the house to apologise to Denise and Lucas for her behaviour on Jordan's birthday. She calls round again later when Lucas is on his own, with the idea that their back together. Lucas sets Trina straight. She threatens to tell Denise the truth and play her the message he left on her phone. Lucas later arranges to meet Trina. He gives her £1,000 {{to get her out of}} him and Jordan's life. Trina is convinced that Lucas still loves her and shows him the bracelet Jordan gave her as a symbol for their relationship. Lucas snatches it from her telling her she doesn't deserve it. She starts flirting with him and trying to kiss him. Lucas pushes Trina away. She accidentally falls on a rake and impales her throat. Lucas walks away, refusing to help her. Trina calls Denise but dies before the call connects. Lucas goes back to check on Trina and sees Denise's <b>number</b> <b>dialled</b> on her phone and rejects the call. Lucas covers up her death by putting drugs around her body. A few days later, Lucas goes to check on Trina's body and finds it decomposed. Her body is later found by Jordan and his friend Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald). Lucas is questioned by DC Deane Cunningham (Zoe Henry). Trina's phone rings at the police station when she gets a call from Lucas. The police then identify the body as Trina's. Denise is arrested for Trina's murder after Ian calls the police but the coroner later give a veredict of accidental death. Chelsea later catches Lucas with Trina's bracelet. Lucas tells her that he found it in Denise's handbag and that she shouldn't say anything. Chelsea agrees. Lucas runs Trina's funeral service.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} of recency states that things most recently learned are best remembered.

For example, it is fairly easy to recall a telephone <b>number</b> <b>dialed</b> a few minutes ago, but it is usually impossible to recall a new <b>number</b> <b>dialed</b> last week. The closer the training or learning time is to the time of actual need to apply the training, the more apt the learner will be to perform successfully.|$|R

It is simply not enough to say, after Katz, that there is no legitimate expectation of privacy in the <b>numbers</b> <b>dialed</b> because the caller assumes the risk that the telephone company will disclose them to the police.|$|R
