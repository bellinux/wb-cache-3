25|$|The Quaker {{population}} of <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>was</b> especially intolerant of slavery. However, <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> ended up becoming {{the last of}} the northern states to abolish slavery by enacting legislation which caused the slow abolishment of slavery. Though <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> passed an act for the gradual abolition of slavery in 1804, it wasn't until 1830 that most blacks were free in the state. However, by the close of the Civil War, about a dozen African-Americans in <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>were</b> still apprenticed freedmen. <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> at first refused to ratify the Constitutional Amendments that banned slavery. <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>was</b> {{a major part of the}} extensive Underground Railroad system.|$|R
5|$|The Constitution of the State of <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>is</b> {{the basic}} {{governing}} document of the State of New Jersey. In addition to three British Royal Charters issued for East Jersey, West Jersey and united New Jersey {{while they were}} still colonies, the state has been governed by three constitutions. The first was issued on July 2, 1776, shortly before New Jersey ratified the United States Declaration of Independence and the second was issued in 1844. The current document was issued in 1947 and has been amended several times.|$|E
5|$|The Governor of <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>is</b> {{the head}} of the {{executive}} branch of New Jersey's state government and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the New Jersey Legislature, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of treason or impeachment.|$|E
5|$|Because DUI in <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>is</b> a non-criminal traffic violation, state DUI {{laws are}} not subject to the Assimilative Crimes Act. Members of the Armed Forces can be court martialed for drunk driving, {{military}} bases can enforce New Jersey traffic law on civilians, and it is a misdemeanor under federal law to drive while intoxicated on land administered by the National Park Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Postal Service. Similar to New Jersey, federal DUI statutes prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while having a BAC of 0.08% or greater, and require a driver to give a breath sample if requested by a law enforcement authority.|$|E

5|$|The Lieutenant Governor of <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>is</b> {{an elected}} {{constitutional}} {{officer in the}} executive branch of the state government of New Jersey in the United States. The lieutenant governor is the second highest-ranking official in the state government and is elected concurrently on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term. Because the position itself does not carry any powers or duties other than to be next in the order of succession, the state constitution requires that the lieutenant governor be appointed to serve as the head of a cabinet-level department or administrative agency within the governor's administration.|$|E
5|$|<b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>is</b> one of {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do {{not have the right to}} a jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey was {{governed by}} {{two groups of}} proprietors as two {{distinct}} provinces, East Jersey and West Jersey, between 1674 and 1702. New Jersey's first counties were created as administrative districts within each province, with East Jersey split in 1675 into Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth counties, while West Jersey's initial counties of Burlington and Salem date to 1681. The most recent county created in <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> <b>is</b> Union County, created in 1857 and named after the union of the United States when the Civil War was imminent. New Jersey's county names derive from several sources, though most of its counties are named after place names in England and prominent leaders in the colonial and revolutionary periods. Bergen County is the most populous county—as of the 2010 Census—with 905,116 people, while Salem County is the least populous with 66,083 people.|$|E
