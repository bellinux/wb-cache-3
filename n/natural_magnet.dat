60|$|For instance, Faraday {{discovered}} by experiment, that voltaic electricity could be {{evolved from a}} <b>natural</b> <b>magnet,</b> provided a conducting body were set in motion {{at right angles to}} the direction of the magnet; and this he found to hold not only of small magnets, but of that great magnet, the earth. The law being thus established experimentally, that electricity is evolved, by a magnet, and a conductor moving at right angles to the direction of its poles, we may now look out for fresh instances in which these conditions meet. Wherever a conductor moves or revolves at right angles to the direction of the earth’s magnetic poles, there we may expect an evolution of electricity. In the northern regions, where the polar direction is nearly perpendicular to the horizon, all horizontal motions of conductors will produce electricity; horizontal wheels, for example, made of metal; likewise all running streams will evolve a current of electricity, which will circulate round them; and the air thus charged with electricity {{may be one of the}} causes of the Aurora Borealis. In the equatorial regions, on the contrary, upright wheels placed parallel to the equator will originate a voltaic circuit, and water-falls will naturally become electric.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the time}} of General Vandamme the {{landscape}} of the Sophia Polder has been further affected by drainage work and sand extraction. The hamlet of Bakkerdam has grown up at the eastern end of the polder. From here the drainage canal ("uitwateringskanaal") flows in a westerly direction along the northerly edge of the polder, following the line of what was formerly the Passageule (estuary). To the south of the uitwateringskanaal, sand extraction has created a marshy creek which forms a <b>natural</b> <b>magnet</b> for water birds. Its attraction to water birds has been enhanced by further land management measures undertaken since the polder was designated a wild life reserve in 2006. The entire area is regulated by a so-called [...] "semi-natural water level management" [...] system ("semi-natuurlijk peilbeheer"). For the purposes of these measures the polder ws divided into three zones. Sophiapolder West (Phase 1) was completed in 2006 and Sophiapolder-Middle (Phase 2) was completed in 2008. There is no agreed starting (or completion) date for Sophiapolder East (Phase 3). The water level in middle section is deeper than that in the western section: the middle section includes a large flat island which is a prime nesting location for water birds. For the eastern section, less sand extraction is anticipated which will make the zone less suitable for nesting seabirds, but more effective as a reserve for rare marsh plant species.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} of electrical charges produces {{a magnetic field}} (see electromagnetism). The intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field. Where the lightning current path passes through rock, soil, or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized. This effect is known as lightning-induced remanent magnetism, or LIRM. These currents follow the least resistive path, often horizontally near the surface but sometimes vertically, where faults, ore bodies, or ground water offers a less resistive path. One theory suggests that lodestones, <b>natural</b> <b>magnets</b> encountered in ancient times, were created in this manner.|$|R

Its idyllic setting on the mountainside, overlooking {{the city and the}} St Lawrence River, was a <b>natural</b> <b>magnet</b> for wealthy nineteenth-century families, just as {{it had been in the}} days of fur traders such as James McGill. As an urban environment, however, the Golden Square Mile was far more complicated than the sum of its mansions. Despite a long history of habitation by gentlemen farmers, the "GSM" took shape only as of mid-century, accompanying the rise of capitalist institutions and the middle classes. Furthermore, it was the result of a considerable amount of planning and salesmanship, which made fortunes for some landowners and speculators even before the first mansions appeared. The anglophone, Protestant character of the area also had to be encouraged, reflecting a growing cultural dichotomy within Montreal society. This thesis considers the Golden Square Mile within the context of urban history: it is a study of town planning, land ownership, architecture, and social geography.

40|$|Magnetite, {{a famous}} {{permanent}} <b>natural</b> <b>magnet,</b> {{is probably the}} oldest magnetic material known to humans [1]. Fe 3 O 4 is a ferrimagnet with an anomalously high Curie temperature of ∼ 850 K which arises from the inverse spinel type crystal structure. This is formally written as AB 2 O 4 where A and B are two crystallographically distinct tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated Fe sites. Both have different oxidation states due to the large difference of the corresponding average Fe–O distances, 1. 876 and 2. 066 A ̊ (at 300 K), respectively. Thus the former (the A site) is occupied by Fe 3 + ion, whereas octahedral B sites are occupied by {{an equal number of}} randomly distributed 2 + and 3 + Fe ions, which results in an average valence value of 2. 5 + per FeB ion. The B sublattice is highly frustrated and {{can be viewed as a}} pyrochlore lattice of corner-sharing FeB tetrahedra. Therefore, mixed-valent magnetite is considered to be a charge frustrated system with a highly degenerate ground state. Fe 3 O 4 is a poor metal with an electrical resistivity of 4 m cm (at 300 K) which is remarkably higher then the resistivity of simple metals, e. g. 0. 96, 1. 59 or 1. 7 μ cm for Hg, Ag or Cu, respectively.

40|$|A nonlinearly {{broadband}} tuneable {{energy harvesting}} device has been designed, fabricated, and tested based on the nonlinear dynamical response of a parametrically excited clamped-clamped beam carrying a central point mass as the core element; a tuning mechanism {{in the form of}} an initial axial displacement applied to one of the clamped-clamped beam ends has been introduced to the system which enables tuning of device 2 ̆ 7 s <b>natural</b> frequency. <b>Magnets</b> have been used as the central point mass which generates a backward electromotive force (EMF) as they move through a coil when parametrically excited. The tuning parameter was set to a value for which the primary and principal nonlinear resonant regions become close to each other; hence, the frequency bandwidth is broadened substantially, leading to a larger amount of electrical power harvested; moreover, the nonlinear behavior, due to flexural/restoring-electromagnetic couplings, increased the operating bandwidth considerably. The system was parametrically excited using an electrodynamic shaker, and the corresponding motions of the magnets were measured. By increasing the tuning parameter, the fundamental natural frequency reduces and the system nonlinearity significantly increases; it has been discovered that when the initial axial displacement is approximately the thickness of the beam the fundamental and principal parametric resonance branches combine thus, the frequency bandwidth (and hence the range of the energy harvested) is significantly increased due to the parametric excitation, nonlinear behavior, and initial axial displacement...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of a coarse-grained high-remanence magnetite obtained from shocked Vredefort granite were investigated by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) analysis and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The study utilized a spectroscopic photoelectron low-energy electron emission microscope (SPELEEM) and was conducted in the SPring- 8 large-synchrotron radiation facility. It is generally believed that the strong and stable bulk remanence of Vredefort granites {{is due to the}} presence of minerals that have been strongly magnetized by either an impact-generated magnetic field or terrestrial lightning strikes. Although coarse-grained magnetite is traditionally characterized by weak coercivity and remanence, the specimen {{used in the present study}} exhibited high coercivity and an intense remanent magnetization. The presence of hematite lamellae observed on the partially oxidized magnetite specimen indicated an array of striped domains, intensifying a remanence and coercivity. We also conducted XAS and XMCD analyses on a <b>natural</b> lodestone permanent <b>magnet</b> produced by lightning strikes; while maghemite was found to be present, no magnetic domain structures were observed. Considering that the nucleation of hematite lamellae on magnetite/maghemite grains is due to high-temperature oxidation, we attribute the intense remanent magnetization and magnetic hardening of Vredefort granites to post-impact hydrothermal activity...|$|R
40|$|Wide {{estuaries}} are <b>natural</b> <b>magnets</b> {{for urban}} development. Several of the World’s major cities developed around estuaries, {{but at the}} same time encroached upon some of the most complex and vital ecosystems. Sea-level rise threatens to submerge both rare wetland habitat and essential urban areas and infrastructure. This prospect discloses the urgency of balancing urban development and environmental protection in Metropolitan Estuaries. The hard task of dealing with this threat may provide the opportunity to promote an integrated approach to regional planning, where the necessary adaptation of cities to sea-level rise could equally promote the preservation, or even the enhancement, of wetland habitat. The two case study metropolitan estuaries, San Francisco Bay (California, USA) and the Tagus Estuary (Lisbon, Portugal), share striking similarities in terms of morphology. They both host large metropolitan areas and important wetland ecosystems. Nevertheless, a finer analysis of development patterns reveals crucial differences in the extent of shoreline alteration and types of land use that now encroach upon natural estuarine habitat. The comparative study of both estuaries provides mutually beneficial insights on the shortcomings of each system, and helps identify opportunities to enhance coastal zone management, adaptive governance and environmental planning efforts. The evolution of both estuaries throughout the Holocene is reconstructed, with special emphasis on the process of anthropogenic alteration. While this impact has been significant and continuous in the Tagus Estuary for over two millennia, large scale disturbance of the San Francisco Bay was concentrated in the last two centuries. The legal frameworks that have guided, with varying degrees of effectiveness, the process of wetland reclamation and landfilling share a common ancestry in the Roman Law. These have evolved continuously in Lisbon and the State has upheld with relative success the provision to keep estuarine lowlands in public control, even as they were steadily transformed to farmland. In San Francisco, a period of deep disturbances over the Sacramento River’s hydrology was coupled with extremely fast and under regulated development of lowlands. During a short period, the property of these lands, which would theoretically fall within the Public Trust, was transferred to local governments and private landowners, which led to their steady transformation onto salt ponds, industrial zones and even residential neighborhoods. As a consequence, the Bay Area now has extensive developed areas at very low elevations, vulnerable to low levels of sea-level rise, and remaining wetlands are now heavily encroached upon by urban development. Around the Tagus Estuary, while most original wetlands have long been drained for farmland, the remaining patches are adjacent to non-urban land uses, which could facilitate future efforts of restoration or allow wetland migration with rising seas. A comparative modelling of sea-level rise flooding over existing land uses reveals that, while around the Tagus Estuary most reclaimed lowlands are reserved for farmland and urban development over landfill is limited, the extent of developed urban areas at very low elevations is much greater around the SF Bay, which renders the region more vulnerable to early stages of SLR. Nonetheless, both cities have begun to incorporate climate adaptation onto their main environmental planning blueprints, for which they can be seen as early adopters of local sea-level rise adaptation strategies. Through interviews with stakeholders and document analysis, the planning and decision-making exercises that led to the recent elaboration of the first Tagus Estuary Management Plan, and the Bay Plan Climate Change Amendment, are analyzed and discussed. Lisbon benefits from a very simple, top-down, planning structure, with a handful of public entities directly communicating and articulating stakes and approaches along the planning process. A lack of transparency as to some specific interventions and a still somewhat incipient tradition of public participation have contributed to protract the Plan’s final approval. The Bay Area institutional framework is well-used to collaborative planning efforts, which are usually successful in articulating conflicting interests, but are prone to limitations derived from narrow, and often difficult to expand, mandates for environmental planning agencies, within an extremely complex, multi-level, governance structure involving three levels of government and very active interest groups. While broad mitigation/adaptation strategies are decided at the National or State levels, the actual implementation of SLR adaptation measures often require a great deal of involvement of local actors. Given that it is at this juncture that adaptation takes a concrete spatial expression, this is also the moment when land-use conflicts arise. Local governments are left with much of the burden of mediating competing interests, between urban development, environmental protection, and other social demands. In some instances, the prospect of shoreline development may be very attractive for both property owners/developers and local governments, given the potential land value and economic benefits, but these have to be weighed against the medium-/long-term costs of defending these assets from rising sea-levels. In San Francisco Bay, there is an increasing awareness of the challenges posed by SLR, but the institutional arrangements are complex, and communication between the different public agencies/departments is not always as streamlined as it could be. Some agencies and departments need to adapt their procedures in order to remove institutional barriers to adaptation, but path dependence is an obstacle. The several projects where different federal and state agencies are partnered with local governments highlight the benefits of a more frank and regular communication between public actors. It also emphasizes the benefits of a coordination of efforts and strategies, something that was eroded in the transition from government-led policies to a new paradigm of local-based adaptive governance. Whereas the articulation of public actors is often easy to address by increasing communication and coordination, conflicts involving private landowners and developers may be much complicated by the threat of litigation. The lack of a strong legal backing to public environmental protection mandates is a major obstacle to shoreline planning around the Bay and elsewhere, and this is highlighted by the extreme caution of some public agencies in upholding their jurisdictions over private property. Environmental NGOs have, in the case of California, a big role to play, as they are able to resort to the same legal and lobbying instruments as the developers, and may help even-out the field between public stakeholders with limited legal and economic resources, and powerful private developers with nothing to lose. There is seemingly a sense of urgency in pushing for the development of shoreline properties, as public opposition to development on locations exposed to SLR is most likely to increase in the coming decades. At the same time, NGOs and public agencies are aware of the stress wetlands will be under as the rates of SLR increase towards the end of the century. “Green”, or ecosystem-based, adaptation is already on the way around the Bay. Large scale wetland restoration projects have already been concluded, and further action now often requires articulation with the reinforcement of flood defense structures, given the level of urban encroachment. While levee setback, or removal, would provide greater environmental benefit, the need to protect urban areas and infrastructure has led to the trial of ingenious solutions for promoting wetland resilience while upgrading the level of protection granted by levees...|$|R
