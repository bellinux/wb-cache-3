50|$|Haliotis kamtschatkana, {{common name}} the <b>northern</b> <b>abalone</b> or pinto abalone, is {{a species of}} large sea snail, a marine {{gastropod}} mollusk in the family Haliotidae, the abalones.|$|E
50|$|Population size has {{declined}} due to overharvesting, illegal harvesting, predation by recovering sea otters, and disease. Because {{of concerns about}} its status the <b>Northern</b> <b>Abalone</b> is a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern. Species of Concern are those species about which the U.S. Government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information has been available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The species is called pinto abalone by NMFS. The National Marine Fisheries Service announced in November 2013 that it will conduct a status review for the pinto abalone. The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Center for Biological Diversity filed petitions over the summer calling for a status review {{that could lead to}} added protections for the species. The Center for Biological Diversity filed its petition August 1, 2013. On December 29, 2014, NMFS announced its finding that the pinto abalone was not warranted for listing.|$|E
40|$|Wild abalone populations {{throughout}} the world have declined dramatically over the past 40 years due primarily to market demands for the mollusc 2 ̆ 7 s edible foot. <b>Northern</b> <b>abalone</b> (Haliotis kamtschatkana), the only abalone species occurring in British Columbia (B. C.), is widely thought to be threatened by potential population collapse {{as a result of}} low adult densities that impair reproductive potential. This study examined the hypothesis that the abundance of wild <b>northern</b> <b>abalone</b> populations are below a critical density required for successful reproduction and assessed two techniques that may aid the 2 ̆ 7 recovery 2 ̆ 7 of <b>northern</b> <b>abalone</b> in B. C. In the first study, I created dense aggregations of mature abalone during the reproductive period to test whether abalone preferred high density spawning aggregations that theoretically enhance reproductive potential. Twelve weeks following the manipulations, transplanted abalone had dispersed from enhanced densities at different rates and one year later, abalone densities had returned to pre-treatment levels. Slower rates of transplanted abalone dispersal at specific locations indicated that artificially aggregated abalone may have an enhanced theoretical reproductive potential. However, transplanted abalone dispersing to pre-treatment densities indicated that wild populations do not necessarily suffer from impaired reproductive potential. In the second study, I installed artificial habitats that provided standardized surrogate habitat for juvenile abalone and surveyed surrounding natural habitats to determine an index of juvenile abalone abundance. Juvenile abalone used artificial structures at greater mean densities than nearby natural habitat and juvenile abalone abundance was significantly different between sites but not within sites, suggesting artificial structures showed promise in their ability to detect area specific differences in recruitment and to easily measure juvenile abalone abundance. Benefits of these studies in relation to abalone stock restoration are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Biology, 2012 Understanding {{the effects}} of biotic and abiotic {{pressures}} on commercially important marine species is crucial to their successful management. The red abalone (Haliotis rufescensis) is a commercially important mollusc, whose shell surface is frequently populated with bright yellow colonies of Cliona sp., an endolithic sponge known to excavate substrates on which it grows. To determine whether a relationship exists between the growth of red abalone and infestation by Cliona sp., divers with the California Department of Fish and Game surveyed abalone in multiple areas within Mendocino and Sonoma counties. Individual abalone (n = 786) were scored for shell length and relative shell coverage by Cliona sp. Animals were tagged, released and resurveyed one year later (12 ?? 2 mo). Statistical analyses of this previously unpublished data demonstrated a significant, inverse correlation between the growth of red abalone and extent of shell coverage by Cliona sp. Red abalone acquiring even minimal infestation by Cliona sp. showed significantly inhibited shell growth, {{with the growth of}} smaller abalone affected to a greater degree than larger animals. Further surveys by this author in 2010 and 2011 were conducted to determine whether differences exist between the frequency and extent of Cliona sp. infestation of red abalone located in Humboldt County (n = 89) versus Mendocino County (n = 106). The frequency of infestation in these counties was not significantly different, but the extent of Cliona sp. infestation was found to be significantly greater in Mendocino County than in Humboldt County. The results strongly suggest that red abalone growth is inhibited by Cliona sp. infestation and that regions of the <b>northern</b> California <b>abalone</b> fishery are differentially impacted by this infestation...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{declines in}} California abalone populations have been {{attributed}} to Withering syndrome (WS), a fatal disease affecting abalone throughout southern California. The desire {{to prevent the spread of}} WS to <b>northern</b> California <b>abalone</b> stocks necessitates further research on both the contributions of environmentally relevant stressors towards the development of WS, and a treatment for the disease. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) based metabolomics; we have investigated the influence ofbacterial infection, temperature, and food availability, both individually and in combination, on the metabolic status of the California red abalone (Haliotis rufescens). Food limitation caused dramatic reductions in all classes of foot muscle metabolites, while at the same time, metabolite levels within the digestive gland were preserved or increased. In addition, food limitation along with the additional stress of elevated seawater temperature led to greater metabolic perturbations in both tissue types than those observed under food limitation alone. WS-RLP infection and food reduction resulted in many of the same metabolic changes within the tissues studied although the effects of infection alone were more modest. This study also showed that NMR metabolomics data correlates well with classic histology, supporting the use of unique methodologies in characterizing both normal and pathological events in marine species. Classical histology along with 1 H NMR metabolomics were then used to evaluate treatment of WS-RLP infected abalone with oxytetracycline (OTC) medicated feed at both 13. 4 ± 1. 2 °C and 17. 3 ± 1. 3 °C. While the histological observations demonstrated the highly efficacious nature of OTC treatment in combating WS-RLP infection at both temperatures, NMR metabolomics showed differences between treated and untreated animals only at the elevated temperature. Principal component analyses (PCA) of the NMR spectra revealed that the most significant metabolic changes observed were related to the post-treatment times at which the animals were sampled, regardless of OTC treatment. Animals at both temperatures showed decreased levels of all identified amino acids and carbohydrates with concurrent increases in the levels of taurine, glycine­ betaine, and homarine. In addition, drug residue concentrations, WS-RLP burden, and WS-associated pathological changes were assessed for both OTC-treated and untreated abalone at 17. 3 °C. Unusually high OTC concentrations and long depuration times were observed within the digestive gland while drug depuration occurred rapidly from foot muscle. Digestive gland depuration conformed to a two-compartment model, with terminal phase elimination half lives of approximately 22 days. Cohabitation trials with WS-RLP infected abalone following a 10 -day OTC-treatment showed reduced susceptibility to re­infection for up to 88 days after treatment. This finding suggests that OTC residues retained within the digestive gland confer long-term resistance to pathogen. This study also provides a further understanding of the tissue distribution and residue depletion, of OTC in abalone during treatment and has also allowed the documentation of the sequential metabolic changes that occur during the pre-clinical phases of the disease at both 13. 4 ° and 17. 3 °C. The information provided will help increase the efficiency of OTC therapy and minimize the potential impacts of drug residues entering the environment from culture facilities...|$|R
40|$|Abalone {{populations in}} {{southern}} California have declined dramatically since the 1950 s when they supported a multispecies, commercial, and recreational fishery producing more than 3, 000 t per year. Today the commercial fishery is closed statewide and the recreational fishery is closed south of San Francisco. In contrast, red abalone, Haliotis rufescens (Swainson, 1822), populations in northern California continue {{to sustain a}} 1, 100 1 per year free-diving recreational fishery. We used standardized Abalone Recruitment Modules (ARMs) made of half cinder blocks (area = 2. 6 m(2)) to compare the recruitment of juvenile <b>abalone</b> in <b>northern</b> California. where stocks are abundant, with southern California where stocks have declined. We compared the abundance of abalone inside ARMs (n = 12) in Van Damme State Park (VDSP). <b>northern</b> California with <b>abalone</b> inside ARMs (n - 82) in the Channel Islands National Park from 2001 to 2003. Abalone densities on the reefs Surrounding the ARMs at VDSP, averaged 8300 /ha compared with abalone densities of 30 /ha on reefs {{in three of the}} northern Channel Islands. Red, flat abalone, H. walallensis and pinto abalone. H. kamstchatkana kamstchatkana were found in the northern ARMs, whereas in the south red, pink, H. corrugata, threaded, H. kamtchatkana assimilis, and the endangered white abalone, H. sorenseni, were rare in the southern ARMs. Abalone were 30 times more abundant inside the ARMs in the north (5. 30 /ARM) compared with the south (0. 18 /ARM). Similar numbers of abalone were found in all 3 years in the ARMs in northern (69, 69, and 53 abalone) and southern California (14, 11, and 20 abalone). The majority of abalone in both {{the north and the south}} were less then 100 mm in shell length. Ironically, the rare flat abalone was more abundant in the north, than pink abalone were in the south, a species which once supported a major fishery. Clearly. abalone stocks in southern California are so low that recruitment is failing, despite their potential high fecundity and the fishery closure. These results demonstrate that ARMs call be used to monitor recruitment in the northern fishery, as well as establish quantitative recovery criteria to assess abalone restoration efforts that are desperately needed in the south...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{estimation}} of a finite mixture model is presented for single length fre-quency data with the peaks {{lying on the}} Von Bertalanffy growth curve. By assuming the asymptotic maximum body size to have a normally distributed prior, we show that the variance formulation proposed by Schnute and Fournier (1980) is a special case of our proposed model. The estimation method utilizes the pseudo-alternating EM algorithm and Newton-Raphson method, while the traditional approach cannot guarantee a Generalised EM sequence if some mixing parameters are not well away from zero. Length frequency data from <b>Northern</b> <b>Abalone</b> is presented to illustrate the method...|$|E
30|$|Many marine {{organism}} exhibit impaired {{growth and development}} under high pCO 2 levels. For example, <b>Northern</b> <b>Abalone</b> (Haliotis kamtschatkana) is a marine gastropod that experiences deformed larval morphology when raised under an atmosphere of 800  ppm pCO 2 (Crim et al. 2011). Several studies have found impaired growth of mussels (Mytilus) under high pCO 2 conditions (Gaylord et al. 2011; Gazeau et al. 2011) but two meta-analyses of molluscs (Hendriks et al. 2010; Kroeker et al. 2010) did not find a pCO 2 effect on growth. Furthermore, in some oysters the effect of elevated water acidity on growth and survival is ameliorated in the second generation (Feely et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of using hatchery-raised <b>northern</b> <b>abalone</b> (Haliotis kamtschatkana) to supplement wild populations in Barkley Sound, BC. Densities of abalone were assessed at sites outplanted by the Bamfield Huu-ay-aht Community Abalone Project, and all fell at or below the suspected Allee threshold. The potential for improving outplanting success was then examined by releasing both larval and juvenile hatchery-reared individuals at different treatment densities and tracking their survival over time using cohort analyses and mark-recapture methods, respectively. Predators represented {{the major source of}} mortality for outplanted abalone and congregated at outplant sites. Tagging, handling, and temperature stress did not result directly in mortality. Juvenile abalone were particularly vulnerable in the first 24 hours after outplanting, experiencing 64 % mortality during that period. The behaviours of hatchery-raised abalone differed from those of wild individuals. I recommend outplanting 50, 000 larvae/m 2 or groups of 100 juveniles in predator exclosure cages...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{levels of}} {{anthropogenic}} {{carbon dioxide in}} the world's oceans are resulting in a decrease in the availability of carbonate ions and a drop in seawater pH. This process, known as ocean acidification, is a potential threat to marine populations via alterations in survival and development. To date, however, little research has examined the effects of ocean acidification on rare or endangered species. To begin to assess the impacts of acidification on endangered <b>northern</b> <b>abalone</b> (Haliotis kamtschatkana) populations, we exposed H. kamtschatkana larvae to various levels of CO 2 [400 ppm (ambient), 800 ppm, and 1800 ppm CO 2] and measured survival, settlement, shell size, and shell development. Larval survival decreased by ca. 40 % in elevated CO 2 treatments relative to the 400 ppm control. However, CO 2 had no effect on the proportion of surviving larvae that metamorphosed {{at the end of the}} experiment. Larval shell abnormalities became apparent in approximately 40 % of larvae reared at 800 ppm CO 2, and almost all larvae reared at 1800 ppm CO 2 either developed an abnormal shell or lacked a shell completely. Of the larvae that did not show shell abnormalities, shell size was reduced by 5 % at 800 ppm compared to the control. Overall, larval development of H. kamtschatkana was found to be sensitive to ocean acidification. Near future levels of CO 2 will likely pose a significant additional threat to this species, which is already endangered with extinction due in part to limited reproductive output and larval recruitment...|$|E
