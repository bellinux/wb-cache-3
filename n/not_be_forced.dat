5|$|The Congress soon {{joined the}} new Indian ministry. The League was slower to do so, not {{entering}} until October 1946. In agreeing {{to have the}} League join the government, Jinnah abandoned his demands for parity with the Congress and a veto on matters concerning Muslims. The new ministry met amid a backdrop of rioting, especially in Calcutta. The Congress wanted the Viceroy to immediately summon the constituent assembly and begin the work of writing a constitution and felt that the League ministers should either join in the request or resign from the government. Wavell attempted to save the situation by flying leaders such as Jinnah, Liaquat, and Jawaharlal Nehru to London in December 1946. At {{the end of the}} talks, participants issued a statement that the constitution would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> on any unwilling parts of India. On the way back from London, Jinnah and Liaquat stopped in Cairo for several days of pan-Islamic meetings.|$|E

25|$|The {{soldiers}} currently fighting near Béxar were volunteers, {{who joined}} the army to accomplish a specific task and staunchly maintained their right to elect their own leaders.

Houston was instructed to raise an army from scratch; because the volunteers had organized before the Consultation convened, they could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to accept Houston as their commander.

25|$|After {{the capture}} of Peking by the foreign armies, some of Empress Dowager Cixi's {{advisers}} advocated that the war be carried on, arguing that China could have defeated the foreigners as it was disloyal and traitorous people within China who allowed Beijing and Tianjin to be captured by the Allies, and that the interior of China was impenetrable. They also recommended that Dong Fuxiang continue fighting. The Empress Dowager Cixi was practical, however, and decided that the terms were generous {{enough for her to}} acquiesce when she was assured of her continued reign after the war and that China would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to cede any territory.|$|E

25|$|In 212, Caracalla {{bestowed}} citizenship on all its residents, {{including the}} Jews.

Indeed, Jews enjoyed the right to practice their faith {{under the rule of}} the Byzantines, as long as they paid the Fiscus Judaicus. For example, circumcision, which was considered mutilation and therefore punishable by death if performed on a non-Jewish child, and by exile if performed on a non-Jewish adult, was legally permitted within Jewish religious practices. Byzantine law recognized synagogues as places of worship, which could not be arbitrarily molested, Jewish courts had the force of law in civil cases, and Jews could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to violate Shabbat and their festivals.|$|E

25|$|A key {{development}} {{in the ability to}} use APL effectively, before the widespread use of CRT terminals, was the development of a special IBM Selectric typewriter interchangeable typeball with all the special APL characters on it. This was used on paper printing terminal workstations using the Selectric typewriter and typeball mechanism, such as the IBM 1050 and IBM 2741 terminal. Keycaps could be placed over the normal keys to show which APL characters would be entered and typed when that key was struck. For the first time, a programmer could actually type in and see real APL characters as used in Iverson's notation and <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to use awkward English keyword representations of them. Falkoff and Iverson had the special APL Selectric typeballs, 987 and 988, designed in late 1964, although no APL computer system was available to use them. Iverson cited Falkoff as the inspiration for the idea of using an IBM Selectric typeball for the APL character set.|$|E
25|$|Historically in Lutheranism {{there have}} been two parties {{regarding}} Eucharistic adoration: Gnesio-Lutherans, who followed Martin Luther's view in favor of adoration, and Philippists who followed Philipp Melanchthon's view against it. Although Luther did not entirely approve of the Feast of Corpus Christi, he wrote a treatise The Adoration of the Sacrament (1523) where he defended adoration but desired that the issue <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced.</b> In his reform of the Roman Mass Luther placed the Sanctus after the Institution Narrative to serve as a solemn act of worship of the Real Presence just brought about by the latter. After the death of Martin Luther, further controversies developed including Crypto-Calvinism and the second Sacramentarian controversy, started by Gnesio-Lutheran Joachim Westphal. The Philippist understanding of the Real Presence without overt adoration through time became dominant in Lutheranism, although it is not in accordance with Luther's teaching. The German theologian Andreas Musculus can be {{regarded as one of the}} warmest defenders of Eucharistic adoration in early Lutheranism.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, 1970, the NAACP {{filed suit}} against Michigan state officials, {{including}} Governor William Milliken, charging de facto public school segregation. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held {{all levels of government}} accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to solve problems in the city's school district.|$|E

25|$|The early Anabaptists {{believed}} that their reformation must purify not only theology but also the actual lives of Christians, especially their political and social relationships. Therefore, the church should not be supported by the state, neither by tithes and taxes, nor {{by the use of}} the sword; Christianity was a matter of individual conviction, which could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> on anyone, but rather required a personal decision for it. Protestant ecclesial leaders such as Hubmaier and Hofmann preached the invalidity of infant baptism, advocating baptism as following conversion ("believer's baptism") instead. This was not a doctrine new to the reformers, but was taught by earlier groups, such as the Albigenses in 1147. Though most of the Radical Reformers were Anabaptist, some did not identify themselves with the mainstream Anabaptist tradition. Thomas Müntzer was involved in the German Peasants' War. Andreas Karlstadt disagreed theologically with Huldrych Zwingli and Martin Luther, teaching nonviolence and refusing to baptize infants while not rebaptizing adult believers. Kaspar Schwenkfeld and Sebastian Franck were influenced by German mysticism and spiritualism.|$|E
25|$|Australian faith {{communities}} {{vary widely}} in their official positions towards LGBT rights, including the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Sometimes, {{the position in}} many of the Abrahamic faiths – Christianity, Judaism and Islam – is to oppose LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage, but this is not uniform across all denominations or clergy, with a number of religious leaders speaking out in favour of LGBT rights. Churches would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> to marry same-sex couples if it became legalised, but this does not change their stance on the matter. Australian Christian Lobby, formed in 1995, and the Catholic Australian Family Association, formed in 1980, strongly oppose same-sex rights such as adoption and marriage. However, the official positions of faiths are not necessarily shared by their membership, with a 2005 study finding that along with members of the Anglican and Uniting Churches, Australian Catholics were among the most supportive of LGBTI people and rights in Australia. Australia's peak Buddhist and Hindhu organisations have expressed support for LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|Bobby Simpson and Grahame Thomas {{were soon}} out to leave Australia 36/2, but Bill Lawry and Bob Cowper saw {{out the day}} and batted {{through most of the}} next.

In the end he was bowled by Barry Knight (2/105) on 543/8 and Simpson declared to leave England just over an hour to bat.|$|E
