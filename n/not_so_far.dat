5|$|Because {{pterosaur}} anatomy {{has been}} so heavily modified for flight, and immediate transitional fossil predecessors have <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> been described, the ancestry of pterosaurs is not fully understood. Several hypotheses have been advanced, including links to the avemetatarsalian-like Scleromochlus, an ancestry among the basal archosauriforms, like Euparkeria, or among the protorosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} of works on archaeology and art {{followed the same}} pattern as with works on physical and natural sciences: that of an itinerary with descriptions of the roads travelled, noteworthy monuments along these routes and descriptions of their destinations. Hence, volume I of Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts describes Navarino (pp.1–7) with six pages of plates (fountains, churches, the fortress of Navarino and the palace of Nestor at Pylos); then on pages 9–10, the Navarino-Methoni road is detailed with four pages of plates (a church in ruins and its frescoes, but also bucolic landscapes reminding the reader that the scene is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> from Arcadia); and finally three pages on Methoni and four pages of plates. The bucolic landscapes were rather close to the “norm” that Hubert Robert had proposed for depictions of Greece.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that skirmishes and battles have begun, the Jews at this stage {{are still trying to}} contain the {{fighting}} to as narrow a sphere as possible in the hope that partition will be implemented and a Jewish government formed; they hope that if the fighting remains limited, the Arabs will acquiesce in the fait accompli. This can be seen from {{the fact that}} the Jews have <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> attacked Arab villages unless the inhabitants of those villages attacked them or provoked them first.|$|E
25|$|The section from Plimmerton to South Junction (a little {{north of}} Muri Station {{at the top}} of the Paekakariki Hill) and from North Junction (at the {{northern}} portal of northern Paekakariki tunnel) to Paekakariki was completed in 1940. The difficult single track section between South and North Junctions that passed through five short single track tunnels was left as single track.

25|$|Gluck's musical legacy {{includes}} approximately 35 complete full-length operas plus {{around a}} dozen shorter operas and operatic introductions, {{as well as}} numerous ballets and instrumental works. His reforms influenced Mozart, particularly his opera Idomeneo (1781). Gluck left behind a flourishing school of disciples in Paris, who would dominate the French stage throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period. As well as Salieri, they included Sacchini, Cherubini, Méhul and Spontini. Gluck's greatest French admirer would be Hector Berlioz, whose epic Les Troyens {{may be seen as}} the culmination of the Gluckian tradition. Though Gluck wrote no operas in German, his example influenced the German school of opera, particularly Weber and Wagner, whose concept of music drama was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> removed from Gluck's own.|$|E
25|$|Fernand Khnopff {{was born}} to a wealthy family {{that was part of}} the high bourgeoisie for generations. Khnopff's {{ancestors}} had lived in the Vossenhoek area of Grembergen Flanders since the early 17th century but were of Austrian and Portuguese descent. Most male members of his family had been lawyers or judges, and young Fernand was destined for a juridical career. In his early childhood (1859–1864), he lived in Bruges where his father was appointed Substitut Du Procureur Du Roi. His childhood memories of the medieval city of Bruges would play a significant role in his later work. In 1864, the family moved to Brussels. In his childhood Khnopff spent part of his summer holidays in the hamlet of Tillet <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> from Bastogne in the Luxemburg province where his maternal grand parents owned an estate. He painted several views of this village.|$|E
25|$|Although {{every year}} over five million pilgrims visit Lourdes and Guadalupe each, {{the volume of}} Roman Catholic art to {{accompany}} this enthusiasm has been essentially restricted to popular images. Hence although apparitions {{have resulted in the}} construction of very large Marian churches at Lourdes and Guadalupe they have <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> had a similar impact on Marian art. Yet images such as Our Lady of Guadalupe and the artistic renditions of it as statues are not simply works of art but are a central elements of the daily lives of the Mexican people. Both Miguel Hidalgo and Emiliano Zapata flew Guadalupan flags as their protector, and Zapata's men wore the Guadalupan image around their necks and on their sombreros. Depictions of the Virgin of Guadalupe continue to remain a key unifying element in the Mexican nation, and as the main national symbol of Mexico.|$|E

500|$|The west front has two 13th century buttressed towers [...] {{high that}} were {{originally}} topped with wooden spires covered in protective lead. Although {{the difference between}} the construction of the base course and the transepts suggests that the towers were not part of the initial design, {{it is likely that the}} building process was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> advanced that the masons could fully integrate the nave and towers into each other (Fig. 7).|$|E
500|$|Some {{types of}} cells {{have a single}} nucleus and {{membrane}} each, but are connected to other single-nucleus cells and to the main syncytium by [...] "bridges" [...] made of cytoplasm. The sclerocytes that build spicules have multiple nuclei, and in glass sponge larvae they are connected to other tissues by cytoplasm bridges; such connections between sclerocytes have <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> been found in adults, but this may simply reflect the difficulty of investigating such small-scale features. The bridges are controlled by [...] "plugged junctions" [...] that apparently permit some substances to pass while blocking others.|$|E
500|$|Newton's {{postulate}} of {{an invisible}} force {{able to act}} over vast distances led to him being criticised for introducing [...] "occult agencies" [...] into science. Later, in the second edition of the Principia (1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding General Scholium, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses {{of things that were}} not implied by the phenomena. (Here Newton used what became his famous expression [...] "hypotheses non-fingo").|$|E

500|$|The {{slotted line}} {{is one of}} the basic {{instruments}} used in radio frequency test and measurement at microwave frequencies. [...] It consists of a precision transmission line, usually co-axial but waveguide implementations are also used, with a movable insulated probe inserted into a longitudinal slot cut into the line. [...] In a co-axial slotted line, the slot is cut into the outer conductor of the line. [...] The probe is inserted past the outer conductor, but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> that it touches the inner conductor. [...] In a rectangular waveguide, the slot is usually cut along the centre of the broad wall of the waveguide. [...] Circular waveguide slotted lines are also possible.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{referred}} to Blink-182 as the band's [...] "underrated masterwork," [...] writing that {{the record is}} generally considered by [...] "fans, critics and band members alike as its best work, Blink's answer to Pet Sounds or Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." [...] The band themselves have regarded it as a [...] "huge turning point" [...] in their career, marking {{a change in the}} way they write and record music, as well as view themselves. In his memoir Can I Say, Barker writes: [...] "It {{had a little bit of}} everything: we ventured far enough outside our genre to make ourselves happy, but <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> that we offended our fan base. It was a perfect happy medium, and it's the Blink album that Mark, Tom, and I are most proud of." ...|$|E
500|$|Eardwulf was <b>not,</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> as is known, {{connected}} {{to any of}} the factions that had been warring for the throne up to the mid-790s. Nothing is definitely known of his background, though Symeon of Durham's History of the Kings, an early twelfth-century work based on the lost late tenth-century chronicle of Byrhtferth, records that his father's name was also Eardwulf, and both father and son are given the title dux. [...] Historian Barbara Yorke has proposed that he was a descendant of one Eanwine who (according to Symeon of Durham) was killed in 740 on the orders of King Eadberht. This Eanwine may be identified with King Eadwulf's son of the same name. Eardwulf's father may {{have been one of the}} two Eardwulfs whose deaths are recorded by Symeon of Durham in 774 and 775.|$|E

Payne once again claimed that the album would be [...] "edgier" [...] and that the group had written most of the songs for it; Horan {{came up with the}} name of the album, commemorating {{the fact that it is}} One Direction's fourth record to date and that it has been four years since the band's formation. Signifying a further maturation of their pop sound, the album's first single, Steal My Girl, was dubbed by Billboard as [...] "no What Makes You Beautiful, but its Coldplay-like piano pop could be a good direction", and that the band was [...] "not entirely ready to let go of its bubble-gum days". Rolling Stone described the record as [...] "saturated with retro vibes"; its songs [...] "split the difference between big, splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours – a very pesky whipper-snapper move that's <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> from what Haim's hit Days Are Gone did last year." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} {{years of the}} 20th century the opera was a regular feature in many European cities, and was still {{breaking}} new ground; in 1990 it made its debut at the Slovak National Theatre in Bratislava. Vienna saw {{it for the first}} time in 1994, at the Vienna Volksoper, in what John Rockwell in the New York Times described as [...] "an awkwardly updated production", though well performed. The opera had <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> proved particularly popular in the United States, where since the Met premiere of 1916, performances had been rare compared with Europe. Lyric Opera of Chicago staged it in 1966, but waited until 1998 before reviving it. In 1980 the New York City Opera mounted a production based on the 1863 edition, and staged it again in 1983 and 1986. Reviewing the 1986 production, Henahan wrote that despite the inept libretto the work was saved by the [...] "melodic suppleness and warmth" [...] of Bizet's score.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, Stanford was {{becoming}} a major figure in the British musical scene. His only major rivals were seen as Sullivan, Frederic Hymen Cowen, Parry, Alexander Mackenzie and Arthur Goring Thomas. Sullivan was by this time viewed with suspicion in high-minded musical circles for composing comic rather than grand operas; Cowen was regarded more as a conductor than as a composer; and the other three, though seen as promising, had <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> made a clear mark as Stanford had done. Stanford helped Parry in particular to gain recognition, commissioning incidental music from him for a Cambridge production of Aristophanes' The Birds and a symphony (the [...] "Cambridge") for the musical society. At Cambridge Stanford continued to raise the profile of CUMS, {{as well as his}} own, by securing appearances by leading international musicians including Joachim, Hans Richter, Alfredo Piatti and Edward Dannreuther. The society attracted further attention by premiering works by Cowen, Parry, Mackenzie, Goring Thomas and others. Stanford was also making an impression in his capacity as organist of Trinity, raising musical standards and composing what his biographer Jeremy Dibble calls [...] "some highly distinctive church music" [...] including a Service in B (1879), the anthem [...] "The Lord is my shepherd" [...] (1886) and the motet Justorum animae (1888).|$|E
