50|$|The formose {{reaction}} {{is of great}} importance {{to the question of}} the origin of life as it explains part of the path from simple formaldehyde to complex sugars like ribose and from there to RNA. In one experiment simulating early Earth conditions, pentoses formed from mixtures of formaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, and borate minerals such as colemanite (Ca2B6O115H2O) or kernite (<b>Na2B4O7).</b> Both formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde have been observed spectroscopically in outer space, making the formose reaction of particular interest to the field of astrobiology.|$|E
50|$|Boron (B) is the {{chemical}} element with atomic number 5, occurring as 10B and 11B. At standard temperature and pressure, boron is a trivalent metalloid that has several different allotropes. Amorphous boron is a brown powder {{formed as a}} product of many chemical reactions. Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a high melting point and exists in many polymorphs: Two rhombohedral forms, α-boron and β-boron containing 12 and 106.7 atoms in the rhombohedral unit cell respectively, and 50-atom tetragonal boron are the most common. Boron has a density of 2.34−3. Boron's most common isotope is 11B at 80.22%, which contains 5 protons and 6 neutrons. The other common isotope is 10 at 19.78%, which contains 5 protons and 5 neutrons. These are the only stable isotopes of boron; however other isotopes have been synthesised. Boron forms covalent bonds with other nonmetals and has oxidation states of 1, 2, 3 and 4.Boron does not occur naturally as a free element, but in compounds such as borates. The most common sources of boron are tourmaline, borax, Na2B4O5(OH)4·8H2O, and kernite, Na2B4O5(OH)4·2H2O. it is difficult to obtain pure boron. It can be made through the magnesium reduction of boron trioxide, B2O3. This oxide is made by melting boric acid, B(OH)3, which in turn is obtained from borax. Small amounts of pure boron can be made by the thermal decomposition of boron bromide, BBr3, in hydrogen gas over hot tantalum wire, which acts as a catalyst. The most commercially important sources of boron are: sodium tetraborate pentahydrate, <b>Na2B4O7</b> · 5H2O, which is used in large amounts in making insulating fiberglass and sodium perborate bleach; boron carbide, a ceramic material, is used to make armour materials, especially in bulletproof vests for soldiers and police officers; orthoboric acid, H3BO3 or boric acid, used in the production of textile fiberglass and flat panel displays; sodium tetraborate decahydrate, <b>Na2B4O7</b> · 10H2O or borax, used in the production of adhesives; and the isotope boron-10 is used as a control for nuclear reactors, as a shield for nuclear radiation, and in instruments used for detecting neutrons.|$|E
40|$|By adding <b>Na₂B₄O₇</b> {{into the}} Al-Fe₂O₃-Cr₂O₃ {{reaction}} system, the Al₂O₃ ceramic-lined steel pipe was prepared with the gravitational separation SHS method, {{and the influence}} of the <b>Na₂B₄O₇</b> addition on the structure and properties of the produced composite steel pipe was investigated. The obtained results showed that the phase composition of the ceramic coating was Al₂O₃-FeCr Alloy-(Al 0. 9 Cr 0. 1) ₂O₃ composite, and with the increase of the amount of <b>Na₂B₄O₇</b> addition, the Fe-Cr alloy particles left in the ceramic coating increased and distributed uniformly, and the denser ceramic coating was obtained. However, when the amount of <b>Na₂B₄O₇</b> addition increased further to over 4 %, the ceramic coating became fractures, the hardness of ceramic coating decreased. The transition structure of steel pipe-transition layer-ceramic coating was formed, the thickness of the transition layer decreased with the addition of <b>Na₂B₄O₇,</b> and the boundaries between the transition layer and the ceramic layer were less obvious, which would {{have a significant effect on}} the improvement of the bonding quality of the composite steel pipe...|$|E
40|$|Mixtures {{of metal}} salts with {{complexing}} agents, such as urea, form liquids, which {{are known as}} deep eutectic solvents (DESs). This has previously been applied to metal salts such as ZnCl₂, AlCl₃ and CrCl₃. 6 H₂O. The aim of this thesis was {{to see if this}} model could be expanded to include alkali metal salts. Some of the hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) investigated were found to form liquid mixtures with a limited number of alkali metal salts, which showed melting temperatures below 25 °C. Utilising glycerol as a HBD exhibited the highest mutual solubility with the alkali metal salts of interest, therefore this study focussed on sodium salt:glycerol mixtures. Four sodium salts were chosen: NaBr, NaOAc, NaOAc. 3 H₂O or <b>Na₂B₄O₇.</b> 10 H₂O, which provided a range of fluidities and contained hydrates and anhydrous salts. The ionic conductivity and viscosity of these salts with glycerol were studied, and it was found that unlike previous studies of choline chloride with glycerol where the salt decreases the viscosity of glycerol, all of the sodium salts increased the viscosity of glycerol. This suggests that sodium salts have a structure making, kosmotropic effect, rather than structure breaking, chaotropic effect, on glycerol. This phenomenon is probably due to the high charge density of Na⁺, which coordinates to the glycerol. The ion transport properties and molecular dynamics of sodium salt:glycerol mixtures have been investigated at the microscopic level using nuclear magnetic resonance and electrochemical techniques. Self-diffusion coefficients of the components of the systems of interest were found to be 10 ⁻¹¹- 10 ⁻¹³ m² s⁻¹ range. T₁ relaxation times were investigated and all systems showed a transition from a diffusion-limited, slow molecular tumbling regime to a fast molecular, high mobility, tumbling regime. Poor solubility was experienced with a range of transition metal salt probes, which was attributed to complex ion speciation. It was concluded that the sodium salt:glycerol systems studied are not ideal for electrochemical applications. The ability of the salts to form viscous gels made them ideal plasticisers for starch. Starch DES mixtures were tested as a binder for medium density fibreboard (MDF). The properties of MDF samples were tested as a function of processing conditions and composition. Pilot scale production of plasticised starch MDF composites was successful, demonstrating the current industrial infrastructure can be utilised for large-scale production at a similar cost to MDF bound with urea formaldehyde resins...|$|E
