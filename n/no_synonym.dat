His primary focus in discussing proof was “conviction” produced by generation of chains of logical truths—not the much more widely applicable and more familiar general process of demonstration as found in pre-Aristotelian geometry and discussed by Aristotle. He did discuss deductions in the above sense but not by that name: he called them awkwardly “proofs from premises” — an expression he coined for the purpose.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cover was}} created {{for the first time}} for the Christmas issue of 1891--covers would not become a regular feature until three or four years later and {{halftone}} pictures made from photographs would appear in 1891. [...] It was in 1893 that the price of the magazine was raised to one dollar a year. At the time the Companion competed with the Ladies' Home Journal which was twice as long, only published twelve times a year, and had a much larger circulation. To compete, the Companion went to a monthly publication and cut the price back to fifty cents--at the same time it upped the quality of its articles and writers. Circulation soon rose to 300,000 by 1898--still only half of the Ladies' Home Journal. To further the distance--the Companion's name was officially changed to Woman's Home Companion in 1896. According to Frank L. Mott's History of the American Magazine, the editor, presumably Joseph F. Henderson, wrote of the change in the January 1887 edition: The indiscriminate use and abuse of the term [...] "lady" [...] has robbed it of so much of its meaning that it has been in a measure tabooed by those who deserve the title in its best sense. The noblest ambition of our end-of-the-century femininity is to be a [...] "woman."..."Woman" [...] is an honest Anglo-Saxon word, and has <b>no</b> <b>synonym.</b> The use of [...] "lady" [...] as a synonym for [...] "woman" [...] is vulgar.During the 1890s in addition to housekeeping tips the magazine also covered subjects such as college education for girls, women in the arts and civil service, travel abroad, women's clubs and health. There was no mention of the war with Spain except for one article on the American Red Cross in the September 1898 issue.|$|E

40|$|The genus Phascolodon Simpson, 1925 (type species P. gidleyi, by monotypy), a 'triconodont' mammal, {{bears the}} same name as Phascolodon Stein, 1859 (type species P. vorticella, briefly {{described}} in Stein 1859 a and described with illustration in Stein 1859 b), a ciliated protistan. As Ciliophora are among the 'animal-like ' protistans, they have been treated as Animalia {{for the purposes of}} nomenclature (e. g., Mayr 1969) and thus clearly are subject to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 1999, Articles 1 - 2). The names are thus both avail-able homonyms. As there exists <b>no</b> <b>synonym</b> for the junior homonym, we hereby replace Phascolodon Simpson, 1925 with the substitute name Phascolotheridium, gen. n., in accor-dance with the Code (ICZN 1999, Articles 52, 60). The intent of Simpson's original name was to reflect close similarity to Phascolotherium Owen, 1838 (a related but geologically older mammal). The substitute name retains the spirit of this intent, and assumes the diminutive form to reflect that it is smaller than Phascolotherium (see Simpson 1925, 1928).

40|$|I {{begin this}} thesis by {{reviewing}} {{the use of}} the concept of tradition in the disciplines of theology and literary criticism. In Chapter II I discuss a number of concepts for which ‘tradition’ is often used as a synonym. Then, by considering traditions in the arts and sciences, I attempt to produce a model of 'tradition' for which there is <b>no</b> <b>synonym.</b> In that model, innovation is identified as being indispensable, rather than antithetical, to a tradition’s vitality. In Chapter III I consider some influential notions of what constitutes a tradition in the history of political thought. In objecting to the idea that traditions are prescriptive, or paradigmatic, I suggest that political ideologies are traditions of discourse, and, therefore, that {{it is a mistake to}} contend that any given ideology can be identified by a simple definition. Location of that identity requires, in my view, an historical narrative of innovation in a tradition of discourse. Such a narrative, I argue in Chapter IV, should not be merely an account of the philosophies, alleged to have influenced political agents, with, perhaps, an account of those agents' policies. It should include a discussion of the vocabulary of ideological debate. In particular, I suggest that the actions of the ideologically committed are symbolic affirmations of their ideological identity, and, therefore, that the intelligibility of accounts of party authority and orthodoxy is enhanced by an appreciation of the vocabulary of ideological committment. Finally, I propose an objection to Skinner's view that professed principles can be treated as 'causal' conditions of an agent's actions. My conclusion is that the historian of political ideas should narrate the history of a tradition by recounting the political experiences of an association of political agents in the light of the changing vocabulary in which that experience has been articulated...|$|E
40|$|This {{self-contained}} lecture examines {{uses and}} misuses of the adverb conversely with {{special attention to}} logic and logic-related fields. Sometimes adding conversely after a conjunction such as and signals redundantly that a converse of what preceded will follow. (1) Tarski read Church and, conversely, Church read Tarski. In such cases, conversely serves as an extrapropositional constituent of the sentence in which it occurs: deleting conversely doesn’t change the proposition expressed. Nevertheless it does introduce new implicatures: a speaker would implicate belief that the second sentence expresses a converse of what the first expresses. Perhaps because such usage is familiar, the word conversely {{can be used as}} “sentential pronoun”—or prosentence—representing a sentence expressing a converse of what the preceding sentence expresses. (2) Tarski read Church and conversely. This would be understood as expressing the proposition expressed by (1). Prosentential usage introduces ambiguity when the initial proposition has more than one converse. Confusion can occur if the initial proposition has non-equivalent converses. Every proposition that is the negation of a false proposition is true and conversely. One sense implies that every proposition that is the negation of a true proposition is false, which is true of course. But another sense, probably more likely, implies that every proposition that is true is the negation of a false proposition, which is false: the proposition that one precedes two is not a negation and thus is not the negation of a false proposition. The above also applies to synonyms of conversely such as vice versa. Although prosentence has <b>no</b> <b>synonym,</b> extrapropositional constituents are sometimes called redundant rhetoric, filler, or expletive. Authors discussed include Aristotle, Boole, De Morgan, Peirce, Frege, Russell, Tarski, and Church. END OF PUBLISHED ABSTRACT See also: Corcoran, John. 2015. Converses, inner and outer. 2015.
