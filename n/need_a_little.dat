500|$|After being cast, Colfer {{said that}} he was happy [...] "to be a part of {{something}} that is so new and different and so needed at this time", and added, [...] "It's good to have something positive, especially for kids in small towns, like myself, who <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pick-me-up." [...] Kurt has twice been portrayed as a child: in the episode [...] "Grilled Cheesus", a series of flashback scenes show Kurt at the age of eight, in which the character is played by Adam Kolkin. Although Kolkin was thirteen {{at the time of the}} audition, which called for an eight-year-old, he was chosen in part because his resemblance to Colfer was [...] "so uncanny even the casting directors were taken aback". Kurt has also been shown even younger—in the episode [...] "The Substitute", club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) comes down with the flu and has a hallucination of the students as preschoolers; all twelve glee club members, including Kurt, are played by very young children.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{remained}} unbeaten throughout February, winning {{all five}} matches. In a home match against Manchester City, Reyes {{made his first}} appearance for the club, coming on as a substitute in the second half. He had no part in the winning goal, a [...] "crunching, beautifully judged 25-yarder" [...] scored by Henry. Arsenal recorded an away win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 7 February 2004, their 24th league match, which bettered a club record of games unbeaten {{from the start of}} the season (originally held by George Graham's team of 1990–91). Wenger in his post-match press conference played down the record, and said of the unbeaten run: [...] "You <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of luck and mental qualities." [...] Henry reached a personal landmark against Southampton three days later, scoring his 100th and 101st Premier League goals. The victory moved Arsenal five points clear at the top, although they had played one more game than Manchester United.|$|E
500|$|Benigno called [...] "The Most Wonderful Day of the Year" [...] a [...] "perfectly {{pleasant}} {{opening that}} the Gleeks sing while they decorate their tree". Canning deemed it [...] "the episode's most successful song" [...] {{and added that}} it [...] "would {{have been a great}} tone setter if the rest of the episode hadn't focused on heartbreak, hate and grinches". Harper said that the song [...] "got the episode off on the right holiday foot", and Stack gave it a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that its performance [...] "almost felt like the beginning of a real holiday musical. It was a little cheesy but also kind of charming and sweet." [...] The next song, [...] "We <b>Need</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Christmas", Benigno declared [...] "fun but too short". He added, [...] "If there's one thing this number teaches us, it's that Mercedes is being woefully misused on this show and can carry a number as well, if not better than she can finish one." [...] Stack said that the [...] "little taste" [...] included in the show [...] "sounded promising", and Harper [...] "totally loved this song".|$|E

500|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza, Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening, and Ushkowitz, from the Broadway revival of The King and I. The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele. Colfer had no previous professional experience, but reminded Ryan {{of the character of}} Kurt from The Sound of Music, and was thus cast as Kurt Hummel. He originally auditioned for Artie with the song [...] "Mr. Cellophane", however Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him. Colfer commented on his casting: [...] "I'm so happy {{to be a part of}} something that is so new and different and so needed at this time. It's good to have something positive, especially for kids in small towns, like myself, who <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pick-me-up. It's true: You can be famous – even if there's no money left in the world." ...|$|E

Another song from How the Grinch Stole Christmas! is {{heard in the}} episode—an arrangement of [...] "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch", soundtracked by k.d. lang, and with the lyric [...] "Mister Grinch" [...] modified to [...] "Sue the Grinch". [...] "Last Christmas" [...] had been released previously as a charity single in late 2009, and is included on [...] [...] "Welcome Christmas" [...] was released as a single, available for digital download, separately from the album, which otherwise includes all remaining tracks and six additional songs not heard in the episode; a different version of [...] "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch" [...] was recorded for the album, which featured Morrison along with lang and used the original [...] "Mister Grinch" [...] lyric.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the novel}} became popular, the reviews became {{positive}}; Crawford Woods, also in The New York Times, wrote a positive review countering Lehmann-Haupt's negative review: {{the novel is}} [...] "a custom-crafted study of paranoia, a spew from the 1960s and — in all its hysteria, insolence, insult and rot — a desperate and important book, a wired nightmare, the funniest piece of American prose"; and [...] "this book is such a mind storm that we may <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time {{to know that it}} is also literature[...] [...] it unfolds a parable of the nineteen-sixties {{to those of us who}} lived in them in a mood — perhaps more melodramatic than astute — of social strife, surreal politics and the chemical feast." [...] About Thompson, Woods said he [...] "trusts the authority of his senses, and the clarity of a brain poised between brilliance and burnout".|$|E

2500|$|In 2005 Stevens fronted the Everyman Testicular Cancer Awareness [...] campaign. Stevens's {{role was}} notable {{as she was}} the first woman to {{represent}} this campaign. Her television commercial raised eyebrows with its suggestive content that included her telling men to [...] "put one hand down their trousers and give their testicles a good feel". On the commercial, Stevens commented, [...] "Sometimes men <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> encouragement to think about their health. This is a funny way of raising awareness about a serious subject." [...] In 2005 Stevens also took part in the Make Poverty History campaign, which aims to eliminate poverty in developing countries by cancelling old debts, improving the way aid is given and removing barriers, so these countries can trade more effectively {{with the rest of the}} world. Stevens donated an undisclosed amount of money to the campaign, and also starred in television and magazine advertisements supporting the cause. Her official website also displayed the campaign's official online banner.|$|E
2500|$|Jerry Herman {{played a}} {{significant}} role in American musical theatre, beginning with his first Broadway production, Milk and Honey (1961, 563 performances), about the founding of the state of Israel, and continuing with the blockbuster hits Hello, Dolly! (1964, 2,844 performances), Mame (1966, 1,508 performances), and La Cage aux Folles (1983, 1,761 performances). Even his less successful shows like Dear World (1969) and Mack & Mabel (1974) have had memorable scores (Mack & Mabel was later reworked into a London hit). Writing both words and music, many of Herman's show tunes have become popular standards, including [...] "Hello, Dolly!", [...] "We <b>Need</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Christmas", [...] "I Am What I Am", [...] "Mame", [...] "The Best of Times", [...] "Before the Parade Passes By", [...] "Put On Your Sunday Clothes", [...] "It Only Takes a Moment", [...] "Bosom Buddies", and [...] "I Won't Send Roses", recorded by such artists as Louis Armstrong, Eydie Gorme, Barbra Streisand, Petula Clark and Bernadette Peters. Herman's songbook has been the subject of two popular musical revues, Jerry's Girls (Broadway, 1985), and Showtune (off-Broadway, 2003).|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{his later}} {{paintings}} and {{works on paper}} shifted toward [...] "romantic symbolism", and their titles can be interpreted visually through shapes and forms and words. Twombly often quoted the poets as Stéphane Mallarmé, Rainer Maria Rilke and John Keats, {{as well as many}} classical myths and allegories in his works. Examples of this are his [...] Apollo and The Artist and a series of eight drawings consisting solely of inscriptions of the word [...] "VIRGIL". In a 1994 retrospective, curator Kirk Varnedoe described Twombly's work as [...] "influential among artists, discomfiting to many critics and truculently difficult not just for a broad public, but for sophisticated initiates of postwar art as well." [...] After acquiring Twombly's Three Studies from the Temeraire (1998–99), the Director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales said, [...] "Sometimes people <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of help in recognising a great work of art that might be a bit unfamiliar." [...] Twombly is said to have influenced younger artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Anselm Kiefer, Francesco Clemente, and Julian Schnabel.|$|E
