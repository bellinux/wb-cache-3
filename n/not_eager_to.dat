Vagrant Story is regarded as a mixture of genres, as it contains elements of role-playing in its battles and platform games when in the field map. Matsuno explained that the development team was <b>not</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> place Vagrant Story into a specific genre, preferring to create the game with a genre of its own.|$|E

The campaign ended ingloriously with Abercrombie's disastrous attempt to take Fort Carillon from the French. Johnson and his Indian auxiliaries could do little as British forces stormed the French positions in fruitless frontal assaults.|$|E

25|$|The fate of {{the houses}} and road taken by the slide, {{as well as those}} near them, was at first uncertain. Initially, the {{municipality}} considered restoring the housing units and the road and leaving it to the owners of the hill to secure it against landslides. This caused great concern among several Hatlestad residents, who were part in owning the hill which would need securing. It was also a concern that the owners' insurances only covered damage to housing, not securing properties against natural disasters, not to mention that the residents were <b>not</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> return to the site {{due to the nature of}} the natural disaster.|$|E
25|$|Although he was <b>not</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> {{cling to}} his {{position}} in government, Buenaventura nonetheless stated that the stability of a fixed six-year term for a central bank governor {{was more important than}} the actual person sitting on the chair. Philippine governance was already under attack from the international community; it was seen not merely as unstable, but downright whimsical, depending on the mood of whoever was wielding the power at any given moment. Buenaventura thus refused to resign, even as a courtesy to the new president. It was at this time that he made public his second career: counting the years, months, weeks, days and minutes {{to the end of his}} six-year term.|$|E
25|$|James {{refused a}} French offer {{to send an}} expeditionary force, fearing that it would cost him {{domestic}} support. He tried to bring the Tories to his side by making concessions but failed because he still refused to endorse the Test Act. His forward forces had gathered at Salisbury, and James went to join them on 19 November with his main force, having a total strength of about 19,000. Amid anti-Catholic rioting in London, it rapidly {{became apparent that the}} troops were <b>not</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> fight, and the loyalty of many of James' commanders was doubtful; he had been informed of the conspiracy within the army as early as September, but for unknown reasons had refused to arrest the officers involved. Some have argued, however, that if James had been more resolute, the army would have fought and fought well.|$|E

25|$|Władysław {{was killed}} in the Battle of Varna on November 10, 1444. The news {{propelled}} Sophia back into the national politics. In April 1445, she participated in the congress in Sieradz where Polish nobles elected Casimir as their king. However, Casimir was <b>not</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> claim the throne and refused to travel to Poland. Sophia traveled to Lithuania where she met Casimir, after a separation of five years, in Hrodna in October 1445. Casimir refused to come to Poland and {{for the next two years}} Sophia acted as an intermediary between Casimir and Polish nobles. In 1466, Polish nobles selected Bolesław IV of Warsaw as their king if Casimir refused. Sophia once again sent envoys to her son who finally agreed to become the king. According to Jan Długosz, Sophia's motherly pleas convinced nobles to confirm Casimir as their king in Nowy Korczyn despite Oleśnicki's support to Bolesław. On June 25, 1447, Casimir was crowned King of Poland.|$|E
25|$|He {{found it}} {{difficult}} to control the mainly Burman region of Toungoo (Taungoo), over which Ava had only nominal suzerainty. When Thinkhaya, the ruler of Toungoo, came to Ava in 1426, he was treated almost as equal by Mohnyin Thado. Mohnyin Thado tried to encircle Toungoo by making his brother the governor of Tharrawaddy, an adjacent region of Toungoo, and staying on good terms with King Binnya Ran I of Hanthawaddy. Nonetheless, Thinkhaya formed an alliance with Binnya Ran, decided to raise a rebellion and laid siege to Prome. However Binnya Ran simply wanted to keep Ava occupied, and was <b>not</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> restart a war with Ava. He sent envoys to Ava, asking for a princess of Ava as the price of alliance. Mohnyin Thado was so angry that he kept the envoys for three months without audience, and had to be dissuaded from killing them. He finally decided to ally with Hanthawaddy and gave his niece to the Hanthawaddy king. Toungoo remained out of his reach {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E
25|$|NBC {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of color programming because its parent company RCA manufactured the most successful line of color sets in the 1950s, and by 1959 RCA was the only remaining major manufacturer of color sets. CBS and ABC, which were not affiliated with set manufacturers and were <b>not</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> promote their competitor's product, dragged their feet into color. CBS broadcast color specials and sometimes aired its big weekly variety shows in color, but it offered no regularly scheduled color programming until the fall of 1965. At least one CBS show, The Lucy Show, was filmed in color beginning in 1963 but continued to be telecast in black and white {{through the end of the}} 1964–65 season. ABC delayed its first color programs until 1962, but these were initially only broadcasts of the cartoon shows The Flintstones, The Jetsons and Beany and Cecil. The DuMont network, although it did have a television-manufacturing parent company, was in financial decline by 1954 and was dissolved two years later.|$|E

25|$|Some slaveholders made {{a profit}} by selling surplus slaves to traders for {{transport}} {{to the markets}} of the Deep South, where the demand was still high for field hands on cotton plantations. In contrast to the near-unanimity of voters in the seven cotton states in the lower South, which held {{the highest number of}} slaves, the border slave states were bitterly divided about secession and were <b>not</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> leave the Union. Border Unionists hoped that a compromise would be reached, and they assumed that Lincoln would not send troops to attack the South. Border secessionists paid less attention to the slavery issue in 1861, since their states' economies were based more on trade with the North than on cotton. Their main concern in 1861 was federal coercion; some residents viewed Lincoln's call to arms as a repudiation of the American traditions of states' rights, democracy, liberty, and a republican form of government. Secessionists insisted that Washington had usurped illegitimate powers in defiance of the Constitution, and thereby had lost its legitimacy. After Lincoln issued a call for troops, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, and North Carolina promptly seceded and joined the Confederacy. A secession movement began in western Virginia, where most farmers were yeomen and not slaveholders, to break away and remain in the Union.|$|E
