5000|$|The Parisians, while denying {{adoption}} of the backwards Russian troupe, had distinct Russian influence in their theater. “Despite Clustine’s protestations, several features of the Opera’s post-1909 ballets, along with its institutional conventions and balletic policy, appeared to betray a Russian influence.” The stigma of Russian brutality and force was applied even in Paris. While their style was not only being accepted in Paris, but implemented in Paris theaters, the Ballets Russes were still considered dangerous, even in the theatre of performing art. “The Ballets Russes, at base, became a metaphor for invasion, an eternal force that could engulf and control, could penetrate the membrane of French society, culture and even art itself.” [...] The embracing of Russian ballet in the Paris society became a point of contention and French nationalism collided with Russian determination. Questions arose about the Russian intention in the Paris theaters under the title “cultural politics” including “the delimitation of boundaries, the preservation of identity {{and the nature of}} relational engagements.” [...] Russia was incapable of simply bringing Russian culture to the West, but created a paranoia of intentions wherever they went. In the beginning, the relationship between Russia and France through the arts was a testimony to their political allegiances. “French critics acknowledged a shared choreographic heritage: French ballet had migrated to Russia in the nineteenth century, only to return, decades later, under the guise of the Ballets Russes. The company, then, moored in a history that intertwined both nations, not only contributed to a cultural programme of exchange. The Ballets Russes were a testament to Franco-Russian cooperation, goodwill and support; they represented ‘un nouveau resserrement de l’alliance’ (a further strengthening of the alliance).” [...] However, the relationship made a negative turn when duplicity amongst the alliance arose. While Russia continued to borrow money from the French banks, “the Russians no longer interested in supporting French culture and colonial politics.” This duplicity gave fuel for the paranoia and lack of trust we see in the relationship concerning the arts. The Parisian press spoke of the Ballets Russes in terms of both “enchantement’, ‘bouleversement’ and ‘fantaisie’. Yet they also invoked metaphors of invasion, describing the company’s Parisian presence in terms of ‘assaut’ (onslaught) and ‘conquete’ (conquest).” [...] The dual-faceted relationship can be seen in this expression of both enrapture and contention. One French journalist, Maurice Lefevre, called on his fellow Parisians to see the reality of the Russian invasion as though it was an infestation, “We <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> soul-searching and ask whether our guests are not about to become our masters.” [...] To imply that Russia was about to take over France through performing arts seems to be irrational, but evidence would suggest the fears were real among those in Paris.|$|E
5000|$|Tourist are {{attracted}} towards {{the beauty of}} Okhaldhunga Rafting-Rafting in Sunkoshi and Botekoshi attracts the tourist in Nepal. Water-falls - Pokali waterfalls attracts the tourists who are religious and loves natural beauty. If Pokali waterfall could be advertised within Nepal it would relief the public of Okhaldhunga. We can take an example of Pathibhara {{as a symbol of}} Devi temple in Taplejung district, the public in Ilam named it as Pathibhara. Visitors from Darjaling and Sikkim visit Pathibhara, this shows that if people have unity the work becomes successful. Gadhi - Historical corners “gadhi” are found to be constant. Repair and maintenance of gadhi could attract the tourist. Chasankhu gadhi of Diyale and Kotkateni gadhi of Thulachhap are also found to be not well taken care of. Cave - Cave has great significance throughout the world. Our ancestors used to live in the cave and wodhar? One of the most popular cave of Pokhara “Mahendra gufa” has demonstrated of attraction of tourist towards cave and wodhar [...] Chameru Gufa of Okhaldunga Bilandu has proved to be playground “kridasthal” of chameru. The darkness inside the chameru gufa makes it difficult for people to go inside. If proper arrangement could be done, travel would be convenient for the people in the district, and it would make it possible to collect the money as well. Religion- Okhaldhunga has a lot of religious conviction center. After Kathmandu the most faithful conviction center and ????? ?????? should be in Okhaldhunga district. The most popular Pokali water fall and forest shaman cave “ban-jhakri gufa” are found in the district, we have established an institution, “Pokali Jharana Sewa Samajh” to spread the information of these beauty and also to help the sufferers and the orphan locally. Okhaldhunga has the most faithful temples; Shree Champadevi temple in Bilandu -9, Kotika Kalika Devi temple in Chisankhu, Jageshwar Mahadev temple in Salleri Laglage, Pokhara devi temple in Tin Kanya Devi temple Pokhara-1, Namaideshwor Mahadev temple in Singhadevi Temple, Kuibhir -5, Mahadev temple of Thulibanshi in Bunnam and Kuntadevi temple of Khudampa in Diyale, Samanawati devi temple in Barnalu-9, Raghuwireshowr Mahadev temple in Okhaldhunga bazaar, and Kalikadevi in Saraswati sthan, Jalpadevi in Bhimsensthan, Watuk bhairab Ganesh temple. Involvement of local government bodies and local people of Okhaldhunga in spreading the information of these temple to people is seem to be important. Social and cultural institution should also play leadership role in the process. Gumba - 15% of Buddhist are in Okhaldhunga and we have eight popular gumba which are also not well informed to the public. Some popular gumba of the district are Tolthol gumba, Riyal gumba and Dolakhark gumba of Patle, Kimardin gumba of Bhusinga, Ketuke gumba of Ketuke, Bhirkhark gumba of Khiji, Ghunsa gumba of Baruneshwor and Lamja gumba of Ragani. These gumba attracts both national and foreign tourists, and nuns and monks. We <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> fine-grained research studies on gumba of Manang, Mustang and Rasuwa. In reality it is not practical for Okhaldhunga if you stay in a room like you would if you were to make a development strategy for national planning in Kathmandu. The reason behind this is only the local public of Okhaldhunga knows the taste of water, and they have love and affection for Okhaldhunga. These local public of Okhaldhunga live their life and send the last minute of their life in Okhaldhunga due to which they should be devoted in development of the district and spreading the information to help growth of the tourism. We should be free from our misunderstanding of the Government employees, {{they are not going to}} benefit Okhaldhunga nor are they going to view Okhaldhunga with a sacred vision. Things to do to make Okhaldhunga a tourism sector: People living outside the district needs to spread the information of Okhaldhunga. Integrate the religious and racial unity in the district. Coordinate the plans and programs of Okhaldhunga to the Non-government organizations. A feeling of “Village development is development of your own home” should be developed.
