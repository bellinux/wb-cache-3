5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch <b>nozzle</b> depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas <b>nozzle</b> depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the <b>nozzle</b> is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the <b>nozzle</b> size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The <b>nozzle</b> must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the <b>nozzle</b> for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{supplying}} {{air to the}} engine, {{the intake}} also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling <b>nozzle.</b> The <b>nozzle</b> ejector (or aerodynamic) design, with variable exit area and secondary flow from the intake, contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off to cruise.|$|E
5|$|CFMI {{tested both}} a mixed and unmixed exhaust design at the {{beginning}} of development; most variants of the engine have an unmixed exhaust <b>nozzle.</b> Only the high-power CFM56-5C, designed for the Airbus A340, has a mixed-flow exhaust <b>nozzle.</b>|$|E

50|$|Shut-off <b>nozzles</b> {{are used}} in the {{manufacturing}} process of plastic injection molding. Machine shut-off <b>nozzles</b> serve as the connection between the plasticizing barrel (with reciprocating screw) and the mold. They are mounted on the machineside of the plastic injection molding process, unlike hot runner <b>nozzles</b> which are mounted on the moldside of the process. Machine shut-off <b>nozzles</b> differ from open <b>nozzles</b> because of their closable melt channel.|$|R

5|$|From 2007 to 2009 REL {{worked with}} University of Bristol and Airborne Engineering on Project STERN (Static Test Expansion/Deflection Rocket <b>Nozzle),</b> which tested REL's engine {{ignition}} system, a REL designed air breathing hydrogen rocket engine, and investigated the flow stability and behaviour of with Dr Neil Taylor's expansion deflection <b>nozzle</b> design via multiple test-firings by Airborne Engineering. An expansion_deflection_nozzle {{is capable of}} compensating for the changing ambient pressure encountered while gaining altitude during atmospheric flight, thus generating greater thrust and thereby efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the <b>nozzle</b> and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the <b>nozzle</b> cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's <b>nozzle,</b> the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The flow {{characteristics}} in mini/micro sonic <b>nozzles</b> {{have been studied}} in this paper using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The result shows that the flow rate of the parallel combined <b>nozzles</b> is not equal to but smaller {{than that of the}} sum of the <b>nozzles.</b> The reason is the each effect of the air after <b>nozzles,</b> which changes the flow field parameters. The more number of the parallel combined <b>nozzles,</b> the bigger error exits between actual flow rate and that of the sum of the <b>nozzles.</b> The result is consistent to the experiment. The study also shows the smaller of the <b>nozzle’s</b> diameter, the bigger error exits...|$|R

30|$|Smaller {{spray drying}} {{apparatus}} may be equipped by swirl <b>nozzles,</b> typically two-fluid swirl <b>nozzles,</b> where the droplets are sprayed {{by a high}} velocity compressed gas jet. These atomizers can be constructed with co-current or fountain mode of droplet discharging. Small laboratory spray dryers generally have multi-fluid <b>nozzles</b> or ultrasonic spray <b>nozzles</b> (Wisniewski 2015).|$|R

5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume {{is less likely to}} be blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional <b>nozzle.</b> A slight drawback is that, like SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes.|$|E
5|$|GE and SNECMA {{also tested}} the {{effectiveness}} of chevrons on reducing jet noise. After examining configurations in the wind tunnel, CFMI chose to flight-test chevrons built into the core exhaust <b>nozzle.</b> The chevrons reduced jet noise by 1.3 perceived loudness decibels during takeoff conditions, and are now offered as an option with the CFM56 for the Airbus A321.|$|E
50|$|Different {{types of}} <b>nozzles</b> are {{available}} for different applications. Some <b>nozzles</b> create a water jet that is in a triangular plane (fan pattern), others emit a thin jet of water that spirals around rapidly (cone pattern). <b>Nozzles</b> that deliver a higher flow rate lower the output pressure. Most <b>nozzles</b> attach directly to the trigger gun.|$|R

50|$|Turbine blades are of {{two basic}} types, blades and <b>nozzles.</b> Blades move entirely {{due to the}} impact of steam on them and their {{profiles}} do not converge. This results in a steam velocity drop and essentially no pressure drop as steam moves through the blades. A turbine composed of blades alternating with fixed <b>nozzles</b> is called an impulse turbine, , Rateau turbine, or Brown-Curtis turbine. <b>Nozzles</b> appear similar to blades, but their profiles converge near the exit. This results in a steam pressure drop and velocity increase as steam moves through the <b>nozzles.</b> <b>Nozzles</b> move due to both the impact of steam on them and the reaction due to the high-velocity steam at the exit. A turbine composed of moving <b>nozzles</b> alternating with fixed <b>nozzles</b> is called a reaction turbine or Parsons turbine.|$|R
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{silicon carbide}} was studied in several {{research}} programs for high-temperature gas turbines in Europe, Japan and the United States. The components {{were intended to}} replace nickel superalloy turbine blades or <b>nozzle</b> vanes. However, none of these projects resulted in a production quantity, mainly because of its low impact resistance and its low fracture toughness.|$|E
5|$|In this game, Mario {{is joined}} by a robotic {{backpack}} named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away goop and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Squirt and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Squirt <b>nozzle</b> lets Mario spray a stream of water which he can use to clean sludge, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. The Hover <b>nozzle</b> lets Mario hover {{in the air for}} a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can be substituted with the Hover nozzle: the Rocket <b>nozzle,</b> which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo <b>nozzle,</b> which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles use water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit he asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot. Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which change his color, depending on the type of fruit. Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water. Juice can be replenished by eating more fruit.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} P.1127s crashed, {{the second and}} third {{occurring}} during development. In 1963, the first prototype, XP831, publicly crashed at the Paris Air Show; the accident had been caused by a speck of dirt in the air feed lines of the <b>nozzle</b> control motor, which had caused the engine nozzles to stick. XP831 was later fully repaired and resumed development flying. All the pilots involved survived.|$|E
50|$|The front two <b>nozzles,</b> {{which are}} of steel, are fed with {{air from the}} LP compressor, the rear <b>nozzles,</b> which are of Nimonic with hot (650 °C) jet exhaust. The airflow split is about 60/40 front back. It was {{critical}} that the <b>nozzles</b> rotate together. This was achieved by using a pair of air motors fed from the HP (high pressure) compressor, in a fail over configuration, pairs of <b>nozzles</b> connected with, surprisingly, motor-cycle chains. The <b>nozzles</b> rotate over an angular range of 98.5 degrees.|$|R

5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} {{is mounted on}} the {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the <b>nozzle</b> coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|A test {{series was}} planned to {{determine}} RS-25 engine performance with: the new engine controller unit; lower liquid oxygen temperatures; greater inlet pressure {{due to the}} taller SLS core stage liquid oxygen tank and higher vehicle acceleration; and, more <b>nozzle</b> heating due to the four-engine configuration and its position in-plane with the SLS booster exhaust nozzles. New ablative insulation and heaters were to be tested during the series.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters {{were again}} {{hampered}} {{when it was}} discovered the pressure relief valves on the standpipes were improperly adjusted when installed in the building. The Philadelphia Fire Department nozzles allowed 100 psi <b>nozzle</b> pressure while One Meridian Plaza's pressure relief valves were giving less than 60 psi discharge pressure, which was not sufficient to fight the fire. It was several hours into the fire before a technician who could adjust the valves arrived at the scene.|$|E

5000|$|Each {{of these}} allows the {{supersonic}} flow {{to adapt to}} the ambient pressure by expanding or contracting, thereby changing the exit ratio so that it is at (or near) optimal exit pressure for the corresponding altitude.

5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were introduced}} throughout the Merlin range: 1943 saw {{the introduction of}} a Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettor that injected fuel at 5 pounds per square inch (34kPa; 0.34 bar) through a <b>nozzle</b> directly into the supercharger, and was fitted to Merlin 66, 70, 76, 77 and 85 variants. The final development, which was fitted to the 100-series Merlins, was an S.U. injection carburettor that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, a {{new process}} based on GTAW was developed, called plasma arc welding. It affords greater control and {{improves}} weld quality {{by using a}} <b>nozzle</b> to focus the electric arc, but is largely limited to automated systems, whereas GTAW remains primarily a manual, hand-held method. Development within the GTAW process has continued as well, and today a number of variations exist. Among the most popular are the pulsed-current, manual programmed, hot-wire, dabber, and increased penetration GTAW methods.|$|E

This tube could be mass-produced on potter's wheels and interlocked to form a permanent centering for concrete domes, avoiding the use of wooden centering altogether. This spread mainly in the western Mediterranean.|$|E
