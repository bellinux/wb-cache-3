5|$|<b>Nicks</b> {{writes that}} Manning would travel back to Washington, D.C., for visits. An ex-boyfriend helped her {{find her way}} around the city's gay community, {{introducing}} her to lobbyists, activists, and White House aides. Back at Fort Drum, she continued to display emotional problems and, by August 2009, had been referred to an Army mental-health counselor. A friend told <b>Nicks</b> that Manning could be emotionally fraught, describing an evening they had watched two movies together—The Last King of Scotland and Dancer in the Dark—after which Manning cried for hours. By September 2009 her relationship with Watkins was in trouble; they reconciled for a short time, but it was effectively over.|$|E

Variations such as <b>nicks,</b> scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E

5|$|Medina and Carter {{left the}} band soon after; they were {{replaced}} by Brian Khounvichit and Mark <b>Nicks</b> respectively. Carter went on to form the progressive death metal band, Deus Invictus. <b>Nicks</b> was later replaced by drummer Jake Ryan. In September 2005, The Chariot began a 27-city tour at Poughkeepsie, New York with High on Fire, Every Time I Die, and The Red Chord. An EP, titled Unsung, was released {{at the beginning of}} December. It featured two new tracks and four re-recordings from their debut and was well received among critics. The band played shows with labelmates As Cities Burn, mewithoutYou, and Underoath later that month. Touring continued through 2006 as the band shared a national tour with P.O.D. in spring and garnered a spot in the Sounds of the Underground Tour with As I Lay Dying that summer. In June 2006, Beiser and Harbin stepped down and {{were replaced by}} bassist Dan Eaton and guitarist Jon Terry respectively. The two men had been longtime friends of the band.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} week, the Giants {{defeated the}} Packers 37–20. Manning threw for 330 {{yards and three}} touchdowns, {{two of them to}} wide receiver Hakeem <b>Nicks.</b> This earned the Giants a spot in the NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers. They won that game in overtime, 20–17 with Lawrence Tynes scoring the game-winning field goal as he did four years earlier in the same game against the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Presley, Springsteen and Streisand, Jackson mixed concert sound for Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Rod Stewart and the Faces, Barry White, Jefferson Airplane, Ozzy Osbourne, Carly Simon, Three Dog Night, The Jackson 5, Cat Stevens, Glen Campbell, Art Garfunkel, Procol Harum and Lou Reed. During 1983 when Springsteen was not touring, Jackson mixed sound for Stevie <b>Nicks</b> on The Wild Heart Tour, June to November 1983. Fourteen {{years later he}} mixed for Fleetwood Mac during their live performances recorded in Burbank for MTV, released as the album The Dance.|$|E
5|$|Iron Maiden {{were formed}} on Christmas Day in 1975 by bassist Steve Harris {{shortly after he}} left his {{previous}} group, Smiler. Harris attributes the band's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, the title of which {{reminded him of the}} iron maiden torture device. After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. <b>Nicks</b> Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976, before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland Point, Stratford.|$|E

5000|$|That night, Linda visits <b>Nick's</b> {{apartment}} and confronts him again. When <b>Nick</b> sees that Jeff also has {{arrived at the}} apartment, <b>Nick</b> sends Linda to his study to hide from Jeff. Jeff tells <b>Nick</b> that Linda has deserted him, and asks <b>Nick</b> to help him regain her love. He also tells <b>Nick</b> that he needs some more money for his laboratory. When <b>Nick</b> goes to his study to write a cheque for Jeff, Linda appears with a gun. <b>Nick</b> struggles over the gun, which fires, shooting him dead. Jeff finds Linda and takes her away, and <b>Nick</b> becomes a ghost. As a ghost, <b>Nick</b> goes to his own funeral, where Whimser appears again and tells him that his ghost is in an [...] "earthbound" [...] state and will remain in that state until he corrects his misdoings. Later, Jeff is taken to court, charged with <b>Nick's</b> death. In court, an elevator operator named Almette (Christian Rub) testifies about seeing <b>Nick</b> and Linda together, prompting Ellen to try to defend her husband. Jeff then fabricates a confession, saying that he killed <b>Nick</b> by accident after <b>Nick</b> refused {{to give him the}} money for his laboratory.|$|R
25|$|He tracks down Grinda, who {{has made}} a lot of money from the Russian roulette-playing <b>Nick.</b> He finds <b>Nick</b> in a crowded {{gambling}} club, but <b>Nick</b> appears to have no recollection of his friends or his home.

To keep him from taking another turn, Mike grabs <b>Nick's</b> arms, which are covered in scars. At the last moment, after Mike reminds <b>Nick</b> of their hunting trips together, <b>Nick</b> recognizes Mike and smiles. <b>Nick</b> raises the gun to his temple, and pulls the trigger, killing himself. Mike tries reviving him, but to no avail.|$|R
5|$|Manning is a trans woman who, in a {{statement}} the day after sentencing, {{said she had a}} female gender identity since childhood, wanted to be known as Chelsea, and desired to begin hormone replacement therapy. Reaction to Manning's disclosures, arrest, and sentence was mixed. Her biographer, Denver <b>Nicks,</b> writes that the leaked diplomatic cables were seen by some (but disputed by others) as a catalyst for the Arab Spring that began in December 2010, and that she was viewed by some as a 21st-century Tiananmen Square Tank Man and by others as an embittered traitor.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} first chat with Manning, Lamo {{discussed}} the information with Chet Uber of the volunteer group ProjectVIGILANT, which researches cybercrime, and with Timothy Webster, {{a friend who had}} worked in Army counterintelligence. Both advised Lamo to go to the authorities. His friend informed the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID), and Lamo was contacted by CID agents shortly thereafter. He told them he believed Manning was endangering lives. He was largely ostracized by the hacker community afterwards. <b>Nicks</b> argues, on the other hand, that it was thanks to Lamo that the government had months to ameliorate any harm caused by the release of the diplomatic cables.|$|E
5|$|According to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, {{a former}} WikiLeaks spokesperson, {{part of the}} WikiLeaks {{security}} concept was {{that they did not}} know who their sources were. The New York Times wrote in December 2010 that the U.S. government was trying to discover whether Assange had been a passive recipient of material from Manning, or had encouraged or helped her to extract the files; if the latter, Assange could be charged with conspiracy. Manning told Lamo in May 2010 that she had developed a working relationship with Assange, communicating directly with him using an encrypted Internet conferencing service, but knew little about him. WikiLeaks did not identify Manning as their source. Army investigators found pages of chats on Manning's computer between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. <b>Nicks</b> writes that, despite this, no decisive evidence was found of Assange's offering Manning any direction.|$|E
5000|$|He tracks down Grinda, who {{has made}} a lot of money from the Russian roulette-playing <b>Nick.</b> He finds <b>Nick</b> in a crowded {{gambling}} club, but <b>Nick</b> appears to have no recollection of his friends or his home in Pennsylvania. Mike enters himself in a game of Russian roulette against <b>Nick,</b> hoping to jog <b>Nick's</b> memory and persuade him to come home, but <b>Nick's</b> mind is gone. To keep him from taking another turn, Mike grabs <b>Nick's</b> arms, which are covered in scars (implied to be heroin tracks). At the last moment, after Mike reminds <b>Nick</b> of their hunting trips together, he finally breaks through, and <b>Nick</b> recognizes Mike and smiles. <b>Nick</b> then tells Mike, [...] "one shot", raises the gun to his temple, and pulls the trigger. The round is in the gun's top chamber, and <b>Nick</b> kills himself. Horrified, Mike tries reviving him, but to no avail.|$|R

5|$|By then, Manning {{was living}} as an openly gay man. Her {{relationship}} with her father was apparently good, but there were problems between Manning and her stepmother. In March 2006, Manning reportedly threatened her stepmother with a knife during an argument about Manning's failure to get another job; the stepmother called the police, and Manning was asked to leave the house. Manning drove to Tulsa in a pickup truck her father had given her, at first slept in it, then moved in with a friend from school. The two got jobs at Incredible Pizza in April. Manning moved on to Chicago before {{running out of money}} and again having nowhere to stay. Her mother arranged for Brian's sister, Debra, a lawyer in Potomac, Maryland, to take Manning in. <b>Nicks</b> wrote that the 15 months Manning spent with her aunt were among the most stable of her life. Chelsea had a boyfriend, took several low-paid jobs, and spent a semester studying history and English at Montgomery College, but left after failing an exam.|$|E
5|$|Fred Phillips, the {{original}} designer of Spock's Vulcan ears, served as The Motion Pictures makeup artist. He {{and his staff}} were responsible for fifty masks and makeup for the aliens seen in the film. The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher's sketches. In his long association with Star Trek Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of The Motion Picture. Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together in a kitchen mixer, then baked for six hours. Though Phillips had saved {{the original}} television series casts used for making the appliances, Nimoy's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated. While {{on the small screen}} the ears could be used up to four times, since <b>nicks</b> and tears did not show up on television, Phillips had to create around three pairs a day for Nimoy during filming. The upswept Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by hair for proper detail, and it took Nimoy more than two hours to prepare for filming—twice as long as it had for television.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage <b>nicks</b> both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Nick", Matty {{has been}} allowed to {{re-enter}} the family home, subject to a contract of rules. <b>Nick,</b> pretenting that their family finally works, lies to Matty when he asks <b>Nick</b> if his relationship with Liv is a problem. <b>Nick</b> insists that he was never into her, but Matty, guessing the opposite, suggests him they need to trust each other. At school, Matty is allowed to re-enroll in college on probation, thanks <b>Nick</b> who was winning Rugby games. Afterwards, <b>Nick</b> takes Matty to meet the gang.

5|$|A study {{undertaken}} between 1999 and 2001 in New Zealand by lexicographers Laurie and Winifred Bauer {{on traditional}} forms of play included truce terms. The terms they described in their study were regional and the most common were pegs (widespread), twigs (Taranaki), gates (Auckland), tags (Nelson Marlborough), and nibs (Otago-Southland). In Wellington schools the dominant term was fans, recorded in New Zealand before 1920, which the authors state derives from fains or fain it as described by the Opies, itself dating back to Chaucerian times. The most widespread term was pegs, derived from pax. Apparently unrecorded before World War II this appears to have first changed to pags, probably from being shouted out at length, and then further mutated by virtue of broad New Zealand accents to pegs. The Bauers thought the most likely hypothesis {{for the use of}} this rather upper class term from the UK, was that it derived from books and stories about UK public schools. Similarly they thought nibs derived from nix, possibly via nigs, originally from South Africa though unknown to the Opies save for a very small area of <b>nicks</b> possibly from nicklas. Nix is also UK public school slang though not as a truce term. Nixs and flix were recorded as having been described by a South African boy as prevalent in South Africa, and were thought by a South African linguist to have derived from an Afrikaans term.|$|E
