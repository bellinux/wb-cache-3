The earliest attempt at growing dates came about in 1890 when the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) imported date palm shoots from Iraq and Egypt. Sixty-eight shoots were distributed across the Southwest U.S. in Las Cruces, New Mexico, Yuma, Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona, and several California cites: Indio, Pomona near Los Angeles, Tulare and National City near San Diego. The imports were almost all male seedlings and produced poor fruit. The Coachella Valley showed promise, so USDA horticulturist Bernard Johnson planted a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoots</b> that he brought back from Algeria in September 1903. On his own initiative, Johnson imported more shoots from Algeria in 1908 and again in 1912. The area's entire date industry {{can be traced back}} to those original USDA experiments near present-day Mecca. Date palms were grown from present-day Cathedral City to the Salton Sea, but most date groves were overtaken by development by the 1990s. Today, nearly all of the date groves are in the [...] "East Valley" [...] area south of Indio, near Coachella and east of La Quinta.|$|E

The external form of a healthily grown tree at any period of its development was therefore composed of a mass of sprays, whose vitality was approximately distributed over the surface of the tree to an equal depth. The branches beneath at once supported, and were fed by, this orbicular field, or animated external garment of vegetation, from every several leaf of which, as from an innumerable multitude of small green fountains, the streams of woody fiber descended, met, and united as rivers do, and gathered their full flood into the strength of the stem.|$|E

After 2.5 days the larva emerge and move to the node where the stem emerges. The larva feed from the node causing the death of the leaf. After 1 to 3 days the feeding damage is evident, the larvae leave the stem, and move to the ground for pupation, where after 7 or 10 days the flies emerge. Adult flies can survive approximately 21 to 28 days producing many offspring during its adult life,. The populations of the bermudagrass stem maggot increase from south to north gradually, with populations picking up in mid-June in Central Florida and late July in North Georgia. In general all the bermudagrass cultivars have been susceptible to stem maggot damage, but cultivars with high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shoots,</b> small shoot diameter and narrow leaves show higher preference by the fly. Currently the recommendations to suppress infestations in the crops are to harvest the grass to help break the life cycle and to apply pyrethroid insecticides after grass regrowth, approximately 7 to 10 days after cutting, [...] Current research focuses on improving understanding of the behavior, biology and ecology of this insect pest.|$|E

Height growth, lateral growth, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> lateral <b>shoots</b> and leaf area were examined as the components of tree form. A negative relationship was found between height and lateral growth : species with high height growth show small lateral growth. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> lateral <b>shoots</b> correlates negatively with leaf area, although the species with small leaf area tend to extend the range <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> lateral shoots: species with large leaf area contain small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> lateral <b>shoots</b> to minimize leaf overlap. Those two relationships were superior to any other relationships such as height growth-number <b>of</b> lateral <b>shoot,</b> and lateral growth-number <b>of</b> lateral <b>shoots</b> etc. 丹沢山地の伐採跡地で, 落葉広葉樹 10 種を対象として, 幼樹期の樹形形成を検討した. 1. 主軸伸長量と側枝伸長量との間には相互背反的な関係があり, 主軸伸長が盛んで上方に伸びる樹種は側枝軸の伸長は相対的に少なく, 逆に側枝の伸長が盛んで横に広がる樹種は上方への伸びは抑えられる. 2. 側枝軸の数は主軸伸長量や枝伸長量との間に明瞭な相関関係は持たなかった. 3. いっぽう, 側枝軸の数は葉の大きさと負の相関関係にあり, 大きい葉を持つ樹種では側枝軸の数は小さい傾向にあった. 4. 幼樹期の樹形形成は主軸伸長と側枝伸長との関係, および, 側枝軸数と葉の大きさとの関係の 2 つの関係によって規定されていることがあきらかになった...|$|R
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the second Intifada the DFLP has carried out a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shooting</b> attacks against Israeli targets, such as the 25 August 2001 attack on a military base in Gaza that killed three Israeli soldiers and wounded seven others. However, its military capabilities in the Occupied Territories remain limited, and the refocusing on armed struggle during the Intifada has further weakened the organization.|$|R
