5|$|In October 1887, Dubois {{abandoned}} his academic career {{and left for}} the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) {{to look for the}} fossilized ancestor of modern man. Having received no funding from the Dutch government for his eccentric endeavorsince <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time had ever found an early human fossil while looking for ithe joined the Dutch East Indies Army as a military surgeon. Because of his work duties, it was only in July 1888 that he began to excavate caves in Sumatra. Having quickly found abundant fossils of large mammals, Dubois was relieved of his military duties (March 1889), and the colonial government assigned two engineers and fifty convicts to help him with his excavations. After he failed to find the fossils he was looking for on Sumatra, he moved on to Java in 1890.|$|E
5|$|Thespis {{opened on}} Boxing Day {{and ran for}} 63 performances. It outran five of its nine {{competitors}} for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond {{the length of a}} normal run at the Gaiety, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time anticipated that this {{was the beginning of a}} great collaboration. Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqué, like Gilbert's earlier burlesques, with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors. Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned. The musical score to Thespis was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in The Pirates of Penzance, and the Act II ballet music.|$|E
5|$|While {{plans were}} {{under way to}} secure funding for the {{restoration}} of the carousel, efforts were made to find some missing animals. By studying old photographs of the carousel, it was determined there had been three deer or stags which had not been found in the park district storage building. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> park district knew of their whereabouts, and some employees believed the animals had disintegrated. As well as the missing deer, two horses were missing. The museum contacted local newspapers, which published stories on the efforts to restore the carousel. The reports mentioned the missing animals, and that the museum was trying to locate them. An anonymous tip received in December 1973 revealed the deer were used in the annual Christmas Gift and Hobby Show, where they served as escorts for Santa Claus. Compton was able to secure the animals from the park district for the museum.|$|E

500|$|As Russell concluded, {{to strong}} applause from gold delegates, {{there was a}} buzz of {{anticipation}} as Bryan ascended to the podium. There was loud cheering as Bryan stood there, waiting for his audience to calm. Bryan's lecture tours had left him a well-known spokesman for silver. As yet, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> convention had effectively spoken for that cause, which was paramount to the delegates. According to political scientist Richard F. Bensel {{in his study of}} the 1896 Democratic convention, [...] "Although the silver men knew they would win this fight, they nonetheless needed someone to tell them—and the gold men—why they must enshrine silver {{at the heart of the}} platform." [...] Bensel noted, [...] "The pump was more than primed, it was ready to explode." [...] Bryan would say little that he had not said before—the text is similar to that of a speech he had given the previous week at Crete, Nebraska—but he would give the convention its voice.|$|E
500|$|Around 20:20, UB-4 {{surfaced}} near Inverlyon, and Gross, on the conning {{tower of}} UB-4, began shouting out commands to Inverlyons crew in German. Jehan, after waiting until UB-4 closed to within [...] of Inverlyon, ordered the White Ensign raised {{and gave the}} command to open fire. A burst of three rounds from the Inverlyons weapon scored hits on the conning tower, the second shot destroying part of the bridge and sending Gross into the water. UB-4, with <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> helm, drifted behind Inverlyon, and when clear, Inverlyons gunner unleashed another six shots into the hull of UB-4 at point-blank range.

500|$|By {{the early}} 1840s, the Audit Office was {{questioning}} the amount spent on Pistrucci. In 1844, the Master of the Mint, William Gladstone restored Pistrucci's salary {{to the full}} £350 and offered him £400 to complete the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci moved his residence from the Mint on Tower Hill to Fine Arts Cottage, Old Windsor, and set to work in full earnest. [...] He was slowed by injuries from a fall, {{and it was not}} until the beginning of 1849 that he submitted the matrices of the medal, and was paid the remaining balance of £1,500. The matrices were so large <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Mint was willing to take the risk of hardening them and possibly ruining three decades' work. So only soft impressions were taken, with no medals in gold, silver and bronze as intended, though replicas have since been minted from other dies. Even if the government had struck the medals, there was almost no one to present them to, for of the intended recipients, all were dead but the Duke of Wellington.|$|E

500|$|Senator Tillman, a fiery speaker {{who wore}} a {{pitchfork}} on his lapel, began the debate. [...] His speech, set as the only one besides Bryan's in favor of silver, portrayed silver as a sectional issue pitting the poorer folk of the South and West against gold-supporting New York {{and the rest of}} the Northeast. [...] It was badly received even by silver delegates, who wished to think of silver as a patriotic, national issue. [...] Senator Jones felt compelled to spend five minutes (granted by the gold side), stating that the silver issue crossed sectional lines. [...] New York Senator Hill was next: the leading spokesman for gold, both gold and silver delegates quieted to hear him. [...] He was followed by Senator William Vilas of Wisconsin and former Massachusetts Governor William D. Russell. [...] Each made their cases for gold, and likely changed few votes.

500|$|According to numismatic {{historian}} Roger Burdette, [...] "Chapman's letter {{caused some}} consternation at the White House". [...] The President prepared a reply {{in which he}} expressed himself strongly to Chapman, but Bigelow persuaded him to substitute a milder letter over Bigelow's signature, defending the new coins. [...] Bigelow's letter replied to Chapman's complaint about the Indian, [...] "The answer to {{this is that the}} head was taken from a recent photograph of an Indian whose health was excellent. [...] Perhaps Mr. Chapman has in mind the fatter but less characteristic type of Indian sometimes seen on the reservations." [...] Chapman wrote again, and had the correspondence published in the numismatic press, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lame duck Roosevelt White House bothered to reply, according to Burdette, [...] "the new coins were issued and would remain as they were for twenty-five years, or until Congress ordered them changed". [...] Leach wrote to Bigelow on January 2, 1909, [...] "I was somewhat amused by their savage attack, and should have liked to have been in a position to reply to this unjust criticism.

It was becoming more common to find members of the aristocracy with less money than members of the trading class. Those {{on the rise in}} the middle class professions were perceived as being more likely to be dissenters than members of the other classes were, and such institutions as the stock exchange and Lloyd's of London were founded by Puritan traders. Members of these classes were also widely ridiculed as attempting to pretend to learning and manners that they had no right to. Further, these [...] "new men" [...] were not, by and large, the product of the universities nor the traditional secondary schools. Consequently, these now wealthy individuals were not conversant in Latin, were not enamored of the classics, and were not inclined to put much value on these things.|$|E

2500|$|Eton {{was not at}} {{that time}} noted for its music, despite the {{interest}} {{of a number of}} its pupils. As there was <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school competent enough to advance Parry's studies in composition, he turned to George Elvey, the organist of St George's Chapel, Windsor, and began studies with him sometime in 1863. Elvey was musically conservative, preferring Handel to Mendelssohn, and though Parry initially idolised his teacher, he eventually realised how unadventurous he was compared to S S Wesley. Parry nonetheless benefited from Elvey's tuition and gained the advantage of being able to write anthems for the choir of St George's Chapel, which under Elvey's direction had reached a standard exceptional in English choral singing of that time. Elvey started his pupil on the contrapuntal disciplines of canon and fugue; recognising his pupil's talent, he soon became ambitious to train him to a standard sufficient to earn the music degree at Oxford. He therefore introduced his student to the string quartets of Haydn and Mozart, and ultimately to some of the rudiments of orchestration. Meanwhile, Parry, on his own initiative, explored the orchestral scores of Beethoven, Weber, and his beloved Mendelssohn. While still at Eton Parry successfully sat the Oxford Bachelor of Music examination, the youngest person who had ever done so. His examination exercise, a cantata, O Lord, Thou hast cast us out, [...] "astonished" [...] the Heather Professor of Music, Sir Frederick Ouseley, and was triumphantly performed and published in 1867.|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, {{he testified}} at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo, {{detailing}} his resentment at {{how he had}} been treated by the Japanese. At the Tokyo trial, Puyi became involved in a lengthy exchange with defense counsel Major Ben Bruce Blakeney about whether he was kidnapped in 1931 or not, which forced Puyi to perjure himself {{by saying that the}} statements in Johnston’s 1934 book Twilight in the Forbidden City about how he had willingly become Emperor of Manchukuo were all lies. When Blakeney mentioned that the introduction to Twilight in the Forbidden City described how Puyi had told Johnston that he had willingly gone to Manchuria in 1931, Puyi perjured himself by saying he was not in contact with Johnston in 1931, and that Johnston made things up for [...] "commercial advantage". The Australian judge, Sir William Webb, the President of the Tribunal, was often frustrated with Puyi's testimony, and chided him numerous times. At one point, when Puyi said [...] "I have not finished my answer yet", causing Webb to say [...] "Well, don't finish it". Behr described Puyi on the stand as a [...] "consistent, self-assured liar, prepared to go to any lengths to save his skin", and as a combative witness more than able to hold his own against the defense lawyers. Puyi was greatly helped as with the exception of Major Blakeney, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> trial had actually read Twilight in the Forbidden City or the interviews Woodhead had conducted with him in 1932, which gave Puyi much room to distort what had been written about him or said by him. Puyi greatly respected Johnston, who was a surrogate father to him, and he felt guilty about the way he had repeatedly on the stand in Tokyo called Johnston a dishonest man whose book Twilight in the Forbidden City was full of lies, causing him to pray for the Buddha to ask for atonement for sullying Johnston's name.|$|E
