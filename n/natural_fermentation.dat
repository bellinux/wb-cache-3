2500|$|In winemaking, {{the term}} [...] "wild yeast" [...] has {{multiple}} meanings. In {{its most basic}} context, it refers to yeast {{that has not been}} introduced to the must by intentional inoculation of a cultured strain. Instead, these [...] "wild yeasts" [...] often come into contact with the must through their presence on harvest equipment, transport bins, the surface winemaking equipment and as part of the natural flora of a winery. Very often these are strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have taken residence in these places over the years, sometimes being previously introduced by inoculation of prior vintages. In this context, these wild yeasts are often referred to as ambient, indigenous or natural yeast as opposed to inoculated, selected or cultured yeast. Wineries that often solely rely on these [...] "in-house" [...] strains will sometimes market their wines as being the product of wild or <b>natural</b> <b>fermentations.</b> The (c. 304) Nanfang Caomu Zhuang has the earliest description of winemaking using [...] "herb ferment" [...] (cǎoqū 草麴) wild yeast with rice and various herbs, including the poisonous Gelsemium elegans (yěgé 冶葛).|$|R

In the United States, soft drinks (as well as other beverages such as non-alcoholic beer) are allowed by law to contain up to 0.5% alcohol by volume. Modern drinks introduce carbon dioxide for carbonation, {{but there is some}} speculation that alcohol might result from fermentation of sugars in a non-sterile environment. A small amount of alcohol is introduced in some soft drinks where alcohol is used in the preparation of the flavoring extracts such as vanilla extract.|$|E
40|$|The {{biochemical}} reactions occurring inside cocoa beans during fermentation {{are mostly}} due to penetration of lactic and acetic acids issued from microbial activities. In the present study, fresh, ripe cocoa beans {{were subjected to}} three fermentation-like incubation schemes: incubation for 2 days at pH 4 in a solution of acetic acid, lactic acid, or both, followed by a 3 -days incubation at pH 5 in acetic acid solution. After each treatment applied, the fermentation index was above 1 and a cut test revealed a brown color, characteristic of well-fermented beans. As shown by RP-HPLC-ESI(−) -MS/MS analysis, the main flavan- 3 -ols found in German Cocoa (Amelonado group) and ICS 40 (Trinitario group) ranked as follows: epicatechin > C 1 > B 2 > catechin > B 5 > dehydrodiepicatechin A. In both <b>natural</b> <b>fermentations</b> and fermentation-like incubations, these compounds showed a sharp decrease, this effect being strongest when acetic acid was present from the start.

500|$|Palm wine (called bunuk or bounouk in the Jola language) is an {{alcoholic}} drink {{derived from the}} <b>natural</b> <b>fermentation</b> of palm sap, so is not strictly a wine, which is produced by the fermentation of grapes. The recent partial Islamization of the region has not challenged its consumption. Fruit clusters are collected exclusively by the men.

The alcohol content of palm wine develops throughout the day. The locals consume large quantities on a daily basis, and even more at banquets and ceremonies dedicated to fetishes. Palm wine is often traded for rice or sold in the city. Many Jola proverbs attest {{the popularity of the}} drink, such as Bunuk abajut birto, which means [...] "With palm wine, one never stands up," [...] or Ulako, kumusaet jígabulaju, which means [...] "Sit down, don't spill the palm wine." ...|$|E

2500|$|While some Christians {{consider}} {{the use of}} wine from the grape as essential for {{the validity of the}} sacrament, many Protestants also allow (or require) [...] pasteurized grape juice as a substitute. Wine was used in Eucharistic rites by all Protestant groups until an alternative arose in the late 19th century. Methodist dentist and prohibitionist Thomas Bramwell Welch applied new pasteurization techniques to stop the <b>natural</b> <b>fermentation</b> process of grape juice. Some Christians who were part of the growing temperance movement pressed for a switch from wine to grape juice, and the substitution spread quickly over much of the United States, as well as to other countries to a lesser degree. There remains an ongoing debate between some American Protestant denominations as to whether wine can and should be used for the Eucharist or allowed as an ordinary beverage, with Catholics and some mainline Protestants allowing wine drinking in moderation, and some conservative Protestant groups opposing consumption of alcohol altogether.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{interest}} for <b>natural</b> <b>fermentations</b> has been re-evaluated in terms of increasing the wine terroir and managing more sustainable winemaking practices. Therefore, the level of yeast genetic variability and the abundance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae native populations in vineyard {{are becoming more and}} more crucial at both ecological and technological level. Among the factors that can influence the strain diversity, the commercial starter release that accidentally occur in the environment around the winery, has to be considered. In this study we led a wide scale investigation of S. cerevisiae genetic diversity and population structure in the vineyards of three neighboring winemaking regions of Protected Appellation of Origin, in North-East of Italy. Combining mtDNA RFLP and microsatellite markers analyses we evaluated 634 grape samples collected over 3 years. We could detect major differences in the presence of S. cerevisiae yeasts, according to the winemaking region. The population structures revealed specificities of yeast microbiota at vineyard scale, with a relative Appellation of Origin area homogeneity, and transition zones suggesting a geographic differentiation. Surprisingly, we found a widespread industrial yeast dissemination that was very high in the areas where the native yeast abundance was low. Although geographical distance is a key element involved in strain distribution, the high presence of industrial strains in vineyard reduced the differences between populations. This finding indicates that industrial yeast diffusion it is a real emergency and their presence strongly interferes with the natural yeast microbiota...|$|R

40|$|Spontaneous {{grape must}} fermentations are {{consistently}} {{characterized by a}} sequential colonization of the substrate according to which apiculate yeasts (Hanseniaspora/Kloeckera), that predominate {{at the beginning of}} the process, are quickly replaced by Saccharomyces yeasts. In addition, other yeasts such as those belonging to the genera Candida, Torulaspora, Kluyveromyces, Zygosaccharomyces and Metschnikowia, may be present during must fermentation (Fleet, 2003). These “wild” yeasts have been considered for a long time responsible for wine defects. Thus, to inhibit their development and ensure the production of wines with repeatable characteristics, grape must is commonly treated with SO 2 and inoculated with selected cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, quantitative studies on the composition of the microflora of fermenting musts indicate that wild non- Saccharomyces yeasts may persist during inoculated fermentations (Mora et al., 1990) and produce high amounts of different metabolites and enzymes able to carry out the transformation of the aroma precursors present in grapes (Fernandez et al., 2000). Thus, non- Saccharomyces yeasts may influence the perceivable characteristics of the final product (Romano et al., 2003). In this context, the possibility “to mimic” <b>natural</b> <b>fermentations,</b> maintaining the control of the fermentative process, represents an interesting approach to the improvement of the final quality of wine. In this study 105 isolates of non- Saccharomyces yeasts, belonging to different genera, naturally involved in spontaneous fermentations and coming from grape-musts of different origins, were identified and evaluated for their principal oenological characters.

40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae is {{predominantly}} found {{in association with}} human activities, particularly the production of alcoholic beverages. S. paradoxus, the closest known relative of S. cerevisiae, is commonly found on exudates and bark of deciduous trees and in associated soils. This has lead {{to the idea that}} S. cerevisiae is a domesticated species, specialized for the fermentation of alcoholic beverages, and isolates of S. cerevisiae from other sources simply represent migrants from these fermentations. We have surveyed DNA sequence diversity at five loci in 81 strains of S. cerevisiae that were isolated from a variety of human and <b>natural</b> <b>fermentations</b> as well as sources unrelated to alcoholic beverage production, such as tree exudates and immunocompromised patients. Diversity within vineyard strains and within sake ́ strains is low, consistent with their status as domesticated stocks. The oldest lineages and the majority of variation are found in strains from sources unrelated to wine production. We propose a model whereby two specialized breeds of S. cerevisiae have been created, one for the production of grape wine and one for the production of sake ́ wine. We estimate that these two breeds have remained isolated from one another for thousands of years, consistent with the earliest archeological evidence for winemaking. We conclude that although there are clearly strains of S. cerevisiae specialized for the production of alcoholic beverages, these have been derived from natural populations unassociated with alcoholic beverage production, rather than the opposite.

40|$|Flavour {{profiling}} by descriptive {{analysis of}} apple wines fermented with different Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and <b>natural</b> sources of <b>fermentation</b> {{with or without}} nitrogen source addition was carried out. Out of 45 attributes used, 38 were found significant and were employed for further evaluation. Generally, the intensities {{of many of the}} descriptors in the apple wines were low. Both the <b>natural</b> sources of <b>fermentation</b> (NSF) imparted different flavours notes like lactic, sharp, acetic and fruity to the wine. “W” strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae gave wines with higher astringency and phenolic flavours, ethyl acetate like, acetaldehyde like flavour, UCD 505 and UCD 522 fermentated wines were peculiar for more ethanolic, sweety and bitter taste, whereas UCD 595 imparted more phenolic, astringent, sour, and ethanolic flavour notes to the wines. The addition of nitrogen source (irrespective of source of fermentation) reduced the development of some flavours considered undesirable (acetic, amyl alcoholic, fusel alcoholic, vegetative). Addition of nitrogen source enhanced the intensity of some other flavour attributes like ethanolic and phenolic in the wines. Due to the same vinification practices (except for the source of fermentation) some modifications in the flavour attributes of apple wines fermented by <b>natural</b> source of <b>fermentation</b> were recorded. The flavour profile of wines fermented by different sources of fermentation, was also reflected in the chemical characteristics examined. Besides higher fermentability, the addition of nitrogen source also affected the physico-chemical characteristics of the wines and consequently, their flavour profile. Application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the means of flavour scores generated from flavour profiling, weakly separated and characterized the wines fermented by different sources of fermentation but did not differentiate the wines fermented with or without nitrogen source. It is concluded that the descriptors described here can characterize apple wine of different quality attributes.
