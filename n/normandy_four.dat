60|$|A {{circumstance}} which greatly {{tended to}} enhance {{the tyranny of the}} nobility, and the sufferings of the inferior classes, arose from the consequences of the Conquest by Duke William of <b>Normandy.</b> <b>Four</b> generations had not sufficed to blend the hostile blood of the Normans and Anglo-Saxons, or to unite, by common language and mutual interests, two hostile races, one of which still felt the elation of triumph, while the other groaned under all the consequences of defeat. The power had been completely placed {{in the hands of the}} Norman nobility, by the event of the battle of Hastings, and it had been used, as our histories assure us, with no moderate hand. The whole race of Saxon princes and nobles had been extirpated or disinherited, with few or no exceptions; nor were the numbers great who possessed land in the country of their fathers, even as proprietors of the second, or of yet inferior classes. The royal policy had long been to weaken, by every means, legal or illegal, the strength of a part of the population which was justly considered as nourishing the most inveterate antipathy to their victor. All the monarchs of the Norman race had shown the most marked predilection for their Norman subjects; the laws of the chase, and many others equally unknown to the milder and more free spirit of the Saxon constitution, had been fixed upon the necks of the subjugated inhabitants, to add weight, as it were, to the feudal chains with which they were loaded. At court, and in the castles of the great nobles, where the pomp and state of a court was emulated, Norman-French was the only language employed; in courts of law, the pleadings and judgments were delivered in the same tongue. In short, French was the language of honour, of chivalry, and even of justice, while the far more manly and expressive Anglo-Saxon was abandoned to the use of rustics and hinds, who knew no other. Still, however, the necessary intercourse between the lords of the soil, and those oppressed inferior beings by whom that soil was cultivated, occasioned the gradual formation of a dialect, compounded betwixt the French and the Anglo-Saxon, in which they could render themselves mutually intelligible to each other; and from this necessity arose by degrees the structure of our present English language, in which the speech of the victors and the vanquished have been so happily blended together; and which has since been so richly improved by importations from the classical languages, and from those spoken by the southern nations of Europe.|$|E

5000|$|Amidst a great {{reduction}} in violence, following {{an agreement to}} restart the implementation of Minsk II that was agreed to on 1 September, the <b>Normandy</b> <b>four</b> held a meeting on 2 October. At the meeting, {{it was agreed that}} elections in the conflict zone would be held in accordance with Minsk II. In order to do this, French President François Hollande said that the elections would need to be postponed until 2016, as three months were required to prepare for them. Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to use his influence to prevent the DPR and LPR from holding early elections. Accordingly, the DPR and LPR announced on 6 October that their planned elections had been postponed until 21 February 2016. Local elections in the rest of Ukraine went ahead on 25 October 2015. Following the postponement, German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that if OSCE observers verified that the planned elections to be held in the separatist areas were in accordance with Ukrainian law and Minsk II, the [...] "law on special status" [...] for these areas would come into immediate effect.|$|E

50|$|Fastolf, {{like other}} English soldiers, profited from {{the wars in}} France by obtaining lands in the conquered territories. He was given Frileuse near Harfleur by Henry V {{and went on to}} build a {{considerable}} property portfolio in <b>Normandy,</b> including <b>four</b> manors in the Pays de Caux worth £200 per annum. Later, he became the Baron of Sillé-le-Guillaume and therefore a member of the peerage there, a position he never attained at home. But the instability of English rule cost him much in lost revenues. His Pays de Caux manors had an income of only £8 after the Norman revolt of 1435. He began in the 1430s to sell off his properties but he still in 1445 held properties in France worth £401, including 10 castles, 15 manors and an inn. All this was lost in the French reconquest.|$|R

5|$|During April 1940, No. 607 Squadron RAF {{was based}} at Saint-Inglevert, flying Gloster Gladiator Mk II HR aircraft. The {{military}} commander General Maxime Weygand visited the airfield on 21 May, and ordered 516 GAO to prepare to evacuate as the Germans {{were in the}} neighbouring Somme department. The following day, the order came to evacuate to Boos airfield, Rouen, <b>Normandy,</b> but only <b>four</b> of the ten aircraft that departed from Saint-Inglevert arrived safely at Boos. All aircraft carried as many passengers as could be accommodated. Two Potez 63-11's and a Bloch MB.152 were abandoned at Saint-Inglevert, and were destroyed to prevent their use by the enemy, as were supplies of fuel. Personnel from 516 GAO were evacuated from Dunquerque on the , although nineteen of them were killed when the ship struck a mine and sank.|$|R
5|$|The opening {{stage left}} Porto-Vecchio {{and ended in}} Bastia, with next two stages ending in Ajaccio and Calvi respectively. The race then moved to {{mainland}} France at Nice. Stages five to eight formed a four-stage journey that navigated westwards finishing at the Ax 3 Domaines ski resort in the Pyrenees. Stage nine took place between Saint-Girons to Bagnères-de-Bigorre, before a long transfer moved the race to the north-west of the country. Stage ten finished in {{the port city of}} Saint-Malo, with the next finishing at the Mont Saint-Michel island commune in <b>Normandy.</b> The following <b>four</b> stages, 11 to 15, crossed the center of the country back to the south-east finishing atop Mont Ventoux. The next five stages took place in and around the Alps, before a second long transfer took the Tour to the finish with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris.|$|R
500|$|In January 1918, a final wartime order {{specified}} that the ships remained suspended, but that all material {{that had been}} stockpiled for work would remain in place. By that time, some [...] of steel plating that had been earmarked for Gascogne had been taken for other uses. On November 22, 1918, days after the Armistice with Germany, the design staff sent the General Staff a proposal to complete the first <b>four</b> <b>Normandies</b> to a modified design. The General Staff replied that the ships would need {{a top speed of}} [...] and a more powerful main battery. Since the dockyard facilities had not been enlarged during the war, the size of the ships could not be significantly increased. This allowed for only modest improvements, particularly for the installation of anti-torpedo bulges. In February 1919, the General Staff decided that the ships would be completed anyway, because new vessels incorporating the lessons of the war could not be completed for at least 6 to 7 years, due to the lengthy design studies such battleships would require.|$|R
50|$|Richard {{was granted}} {{substantial}} estates in Shropshire by a charter of confirmation. This was {{issued by the}} king at Portsmouth in August 1127, probably while he was waiting to embark for <b>Normandy.</b> It covered <b>four</b> prebends of St Alkmund's collegiate church in Shrewsbury: Lilleshall, Atcham, Uckington and Preston Gubbals. The Domesday survey had found that these were {{in the hands of}} a cleric called Godebold, who seems, like Richard de Belmeis I, to have been close to Roger Mortimer, and who gave his name to Preston Gubbals. He was succeeded by his son, Robert, who probably sided with the revolt of Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, as the estates were granted by Henry I to the elder Richard. They were within the king's gift, as St Alkmund's was a royal foundation. However, they remained ecclesiastical estates, held in mortmain, and could not be alienated to an individual. The king's charter, addressed to the Bishop of Chester and to the barons of Shropshire, simultaneously honoured the memory of the faithful, deceased bishop; recognised his nephew as his spiritual heir; and reasserted the inalienability of the prebends as Church property in the gift of the king. It reaffirmed that these were lands which the Bishop of London “held from the king and which formerly belonged to Godebald and his son Robert.” Richard became a canon of St Alkmund's and was later recognised as dean.|$|R
