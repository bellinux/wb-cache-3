Its effects are recorded at Rome, Sicily, Spain, and in Africaindeed, Maximian encouraged particularly strict enforcement of the edict in Africa. Africa's political elite were insistent that the persecution be fulfilled, and Africa's Christians, especially in Numidia, were equally insistent on resisting them. For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures {{was an act of}} terrible apostasy. Africa had long been home to the Church of the Martyrsin Africa, martyrs held more religious authority than the clergyand harbored a particularly intransigent, fanatical, and legalistic variety of Christianity. It was Africa that gave the West most of its martyrdoms.|$|E

25|$|The Dacians {{knew about}} writing. Permanent {{contacts}} with the Graeco-Roman world had brought {{the use of the}} Greek and later the Latin alphabet. It is also certainly not the case that writing with Greek and Latin letters and knowledge of Greek and Latin were known in all the settlements scattered throughout Dacia, but there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> existence of such knowledge in some circles of Dacian society. However, the most revealing discoveries concerning the use of the writing by the Dacians occurred in the citadels on the Sebes mountains. Some groups of letters from stone blocks at Sarmisegetuza might express personal names; these can not now be read because the wall is ruined, and because it is impossible to restore the original order of the blocks in the wall.|$|E
25|$|This {{branch of}} the family was {{maintained}} in their nobility by judgments dated 3 September 1666, by Mr. Dupuy (or du Puy), subdelegate of Claude Pellot, Intendant of Guyenne in Bordeaux, 20 June 1696 by Claude Bazin de Bezons, also the Intendant of Guyenne in Bordeaux, and, lastly by a judgment of the Conseil d'État rendered 29 June 1787 {{in the presence of}} the King. These three judgments leave <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> origins of the branch, in that the family's nobility and filiation was legally established going back to Jean de Forcade, who was qualified as noble, Squire and Governor of the Château d'Auvillar in his marriage contract dated 29 April 1554. The 3 September 1666 judgment further confirms that Philippe de La Forcade, sieur de La Prade, was a squire, a captain in the infantry, that his father had been one of the Henry IV of France's bodyguards, that his grandfather had been Governor of the Château d'Auvillar and that they descended from the noble house of Forcade in Orthez, in Béarn.|$|E
500|$|An {{article on}} the historicity of the Icelandic sagas notes that [...] "Brodir" [...] is not a Norse proper name at all, and is itself derived from the Irish name {{variously}} written as Bruattar, Bruadar or Brodur. According to the article, the name first appears in the Annals of Ulster in the year 853, when a princeling of south-east Ireland named Bruattar mac Aeda {{was involved in the}} murder of a rival before being slain himself. The name only appears in Norse context twice — at the Battle of Clontarf, and in 1160 for the King of Dublin, Brodar mac Torcaill — and had a longer circulation in Irish literature. The same article also suggests that while there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> historical truth of the Battle of Clontarf, the name [...] "Ospakr", along with other names in the Njál's saga account of the Clontarf episode, may have been borrowed from the Landnámabók.|$|E

The role garnered him the 2008 British Academy Television Award for Best Actor. Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle wrote that [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> intelligence and sensitivity" [...] of Garfield's portrayal. Minneapolis Star Tribune Christy DeSmith echoed Biancolli's sentiment, citing his [...] "detailed expressions" [...] as an example. Writing in The Seattle Times, John Hartl noted that Garfield demonstrated range in the role, and concluded: [...] "Garfield always manages to capture his passion". Joe Morgenstern, the critic for The Wall Street Journal, dubbed Garfield's performance [...] "phenomenal", assessing that he [...] "makes room for the many and various pieces of Jack's personality". In 2008, he had a minor role in the film The Other Boleyn Girl, and was {{named one of the}} shooting stars at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 2009, Garfield held supporting roles in the Terry Gilliam film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus and the Red Riding television trilogy. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought that Garfield gave a stand out performance in the latter.|$|E
500|$|St. Laurent {{was utterly}} {{confident}} {{of an election}} victory, {{so much so that}} he did not even bother to fill the sixteen vacancies in the Senate. He had been confident of re-election when Drew led the Tories, and, according to Liberal minister Lionel Chevrier, Diefenbaker's victory in the party leadership race increased his confidence by a factor of ten. At his press conference detailing his election tour, St. Laurent stated, [...] "I have <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> election outcome." [...] He indicated that his campaign would open April 29 in Winnipeg, and that the Prime Minister would spend ten days in Western Canada before moving east. However, he indicated he would first go home to Quebec City for several days around Easter (April 21 in 1957). This break kept him out of the limelight for ten days at a time when Diefenbaker was already actively campaigning and making daily headlines. At a campaign stop in Jarvis, Ontario, St. Laurent told an aide that he was afraid the right-wing, anti-Catholic Social Credit Party would be the next Opposition. St. Laurent denied Opposition claims that he would resign after an election victory, and the 75-year-old indicated that he planned to run again in 1961, if he was still around.|$|E
500|$|Immediately upon {{signing the}} lease, Wagner invited the von Bülows and their {{children}} to stay with him. They spent the summer there, returning briefly to Munich before von Bülow left for Basel while Cosima went back to Tribschen. By now von Bülow understood his wife's relationship with Wagner; he wrote to a friend that [...] "since February 1865 I was in absolutely <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> extremely peculiar nature of the situation". [...] Wagner, anxious to avoid associating Cosima in a public scandal, deceived Ludwig into issuing a statement in June 1866 which declared the unbroken sanctity of the von Bülows' marriage, and promised retribution for those daring to suggest otherwise. By this time Cosima was pregnant with her second child by Wagner; a daughter, Eva, was born at Tribschen on 17 February 1867. Through all this, von Bülow retained his devotion to Wagner's music. He had been appointed {{music director of the}} Munich Hofoper, and threw himself into the preparations for the premiere of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. This took place on 21 June 1868 under his baton, and was a great success. Shortly afterwards, Cosima rejoined Wagner at Tribschen; Wagner explained to the king that she could not bear the insults to which she was continually subjected in Munich, and wished to escape from the world.|$|E

Nyaya-Vaisheshikas were most outspoken in this regard, [...] "after a knowledge is proved true in practice, there remains <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> proof; hence the question of proving does not arise". On the other hand, the idealists believed in complete separation between theory and practice.

2500|$|The 16th-century {{historian}} John Leland {{seems to}} have been responsible for starting the [...] "convent" [...] legend by reference to a [...] "humble little monastery". Unfortunately some 19th-century local historians unquestioningly accepted the pre-Viking era date given in the Life, and presumably prompted by Leland, they embellished the tale with the founding of a convent. In the words of John Todd writing in 1980, [...] "Local historians in the last century had <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> answer. She was an Irish saint who crossed the sea about 650 to found a convent at St Bees, which was destroyed in the Viking invasion.

[...] Sociologist Diego Gambetta points out that the Mafia, being a secretive criminal organization, cannot risk having its recruits sign application forms and written contracts which might be seized by the police. [...] Thus they rely on the old-fashioned ritual ceremony. [...] The {{elements of}} the ceremony are made deliberately specific, bizarre, and painful so that the event is both memorable and unambiguous, and the ceremony is witnessed by a number of senior mafiosi. The participants may not even care about what the symbols mean, and they may indeed have no intrinsic meaning.
