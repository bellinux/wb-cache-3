5|$|In both corpora {{there were}} many more monosyllables/single glyphs in running text than in the lexicon. That is, in both a {{relatively}} small number of such forms are very frequent, suggesting that rongorongo is compatible with Rapanui, which has a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> frequent monosyllabic grammatical particles. Rongorongo and Rapanui are also almost identical in the proportion of syllables/glyphs found in isolation and in initial, medial, and final position within a word/ligature.|$|E
5|$|In {{the dense}} areas, {{most of the}} {{concentration}} is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe, Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings. Nevertheless, there are a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> tall skyscrapers in central London (see Tall buildings in London), including the 95-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the European Union.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{received}} worldwide attention, {{and it had}} immediate {{effects on}} navies around the world. The preeminent naval powers, Great Britain and France, halted further construction of wooden-hulled ships, and others followed suit. A new type of warship, monitor, was produced {{based on the principle}} of the original. The use of a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> heavy guns, mounted so that they could fire in all directions was first demonstrated by Monitor but soon became standard in warships of all types. Shipbuilders also incorporated rams into the designs of warship hulls {{for the rest of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s {{electricity}} was supplied by municipal undertakings. These were small power companies that built power stations {{dedicated to a}} single industry or group of factories, and sold any excess electricity to the public. These companies used widely differing standards of voltage and frequency. In 1925 Parliament decided that the power grid should be a single system with uniform standards and under public ownership. Several of the private power companies reacted to the proposal by forming the London Power Company. They planned to heed parliament's recommendations and build a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> large stations.|$|E
5|$|Impact crater diameters seen {{range from}} 0.1kma limit {{defined by the}} imaging resolutionto over 100km, not {{counting}} the multi-ring structures. Small craters, with diameters less than 5km, have simple bowl or flat-floored shapes. Those 540km across usually have a central peak. Larger impact features, with diameters in the range 25100km, have central pits instead of peaks, such as Tindr crater. The largest craters with diameters over 60km can have central domes, which are thought to result from central tectonic uplift after an impact; examples include Doh and Hár craters. A small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> largemore 100km in diameterand bright impact craters show anomalous dome geometry. These are unusually shallow and may be a transitional landform to the multi-ring structures, as with the Lofn impact feature. Callisto's craters are generally shallower than those on the Moon.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, {{abolishing the}} draft also meant abolishing {{civilian}} service. A purely civilian compulsory service would be {{incompatible with the}} German basic law, which permitted the draft only {{for the purpose of}} defense. This caused a considerable drop in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> people working in the care of children and elderly people. Such care facilities often relied on civilian service to furnish them with large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> low-paid workers.|$|R

25|$|Book {{publishers}} represent {{less than}} a sixth of the publishers in the United States. Most books are published by a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> large book publishers, but thousands of smaller book publishers exist. Many small- and medium-sized book publishers specialize in a specific area. Additionally, thousands of authors have created publishing companies and self-published their own works.|$|E
25|$|N* is {{the number}} of stars in the Milky Way. This number is not well-estimated, because the Milky Way's mass is not well estimated. Moreover, there is little {{information}} about the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> small stars. N* is at least 100 billion, and may be as high as 500 billion, if there are many low visibility stars.|$|E
50|$|Triplanes {{too were}} experimented with, notably a series built between 1909 and 1910 by the British pioneer A.V. Roe. Going one better with four wings the quadruplane too made rare appearances. The Multiplane, having large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> thin wings, was also experimented with, most {{successfully}} by Horatio Phillips. His final prototype confirmed the inefficiency and poor {{performance of the}} idea.|$|R

25|$|In early 2006, {{residents}} of the former town of Rayside-Balfour began to campaign for the deamalgamation {{of the city and}} the return of the former municipal government structure. The city government has refused to endorse the petition — even if the petition were endorsed by the city, however, any deamalgamation referendum would still require the consent of the provincial Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, which has set a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> strict conditions for permitting a referendum.|$|E
25|$|The {{premise of}} SAP 4.7 was that climate is changing. Sea {{levels in the}} Gulf of Mexico are likely to rise by two to four feet over the next 50 to 100 years from the {{combination}} of climate-induced warming and land subsidence. Tropical storms are anticipated to increase in intensity {{and the number of}} heavy precipitation events is expected to increase, raising prospects of flooding and structural damage. And the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> hot days (i.e., >90°F) could rise by 50%.|$|E
25|$|Each of the Five Boroughs {{was ruled}} as a Danish Jarldom, {{controlling}} lands around a fortified burh, {{which served as}} the centre of political power. These rulers were probably initially subject to their overlords in the Viking Kingdom of Jorvik (or York) and operated their armies sometimes independently but often in alliance with rulers of their neighbours. In addition to the Five Boroughs there were also a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> large Danish settlements to the south, including Northampton and Bedford which existed in a similar fashion.|$|E
5|$|The {{field is}} so small {{that only a few}} {{foreground}} stars in the Milky Way lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are galaxies, some of which are among the youngest and most distant known.

25|$|Newcomb's snail is endemic and {{restricted}} to the island of Kauaʻi. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> large watersheds traverse the southeast quadrant of the Kauaʻi island, including Olokele Stream, Hanapēpē Stream and Waimea River, {{all of which have}} numerous tributaries. No recent surveys for Newcomb's snails have been undertaken in the Hanapēpē watershed, or in any of the large neighboring stream systems, because they are located on privately owned lands and are difficult to reach because of the rough terrain. It is possible that Newcomb's snail populations remain in that region of Kauaʻi.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{considered}} a great distinction {{to be named}} on either the batting or bowling honours boards. To be named on both is an exceptional achievement and only nine players have managed this. Those players are England's Gubby Allen, Ray Illingworth, Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff, Stuart Broad and Ben Stokes along with Australia's Keith Miller, the West Indies' Sir Garfield Sobers, and India's Vinoo Mankad. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> distinguished players such as Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting, Shane Warne, Curtly Ambrose and Brian Lara are not named on the honours boards.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{from human}} remains shows that average {{age at death}} {{increased}} over the Archaic period, {{but there is no}} clear trend for other measures of health. The size of houses gives some evidence for prosperity within society; in the eighth and seventh centuries, the average house size remained constant around 45-50 m², but the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> large and very small houses increased, indicating increasing economic inequality. From the end of the seventh century, this trend reversed, with houses clustering closely around a growing average.|$|E
50|$|Female Sthenoteuthis pteropus mature in two {{different}} size ranges, at mantle lengths of 23 to 27 cm and 38 to 45 cm. In mature individuals, spawning takes place intermittently, up to a million ripe eggs with a diameter of about 0.8 mm being present in the ovaries {{at any one time}} as well as a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> immature oocytes. This seems consistent with a reproductive strategy consisting <b>of</b> producing large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> small eggs, a long period of sporadic spawning and a continuation of feeding and growth by the female while breeding.|$|R

25|$|The {{emergent}} layer {{contains a}} small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> large trees, called emergents, which grow above the general canopy, reaching heights of 45–55m, although on occasion a few species {{will grow to}} 70–80m tall. Some examples of emergents include: Balizia elegans, Dipteryx panamensis, Hieronyma alchorneoides, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Lecythis ampla and Terminalia oblonga. These trees {{need to be able}} to withstand the hot temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas. Several unique faunal species inhabit this layer such as the crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus), the king colobus (Colobus polykomos), and the large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus).|$|E
25|$|On 12 September, {{the day the}} Americans {{attacked}} at St Mihiel, Third Army {{began moving}} up to the Hindenburg Line by attacking at Havrincourt, beginning a fortnight of grinding progress against Germans who were still fighting hard on that sector. On 18 September Fourth Army attacked at Epehy, reaching the Hindenburg Line. Haig received a congratulatory note from Wilson saying “you must be a famous general", to which he replied {{that he was not}} (as this would have meant currying favour with Repington and the Northcliffe Press) but “we have a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> capable generals”.|$|E
25|$|When Alex George {{published}} his revision of Dryandra in 1996, he recognised that D.bipinatifida possessed a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> distinctive characters, especially in its fruiting structure. These include unusually large follicles and seeds; seeds that are set within the seed wings rather than along the base or one side; and unusual double wings that {{are attached to}} {{each side of the}} seed. In addition, the species has extremely long involucral bracts, and floral bracts that enlarge more than any other species. Recognising the need for this species to be placed in its own subgenus, George resurrected Diplophragma, promoting it to subgenus rank as D.subg. Diplophragma.|$|E
