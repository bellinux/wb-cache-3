5|$|Mixing about 2.0% {{beryllium}} into copper {{forms an}} alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone. Beryllium alloys {{are used in}} many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic properties, as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance. These applications include <b>non-sparking</b> tools that are used near flammable gases (beryllium nickel), in springs and membranes (beryllium nickel and beryllium iron) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices. As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to {{a significant increase in}} oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.|$|E
5|$|To avoid a {{potentially}} vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal {{is kept in}} an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned <b>non-sparking</b> shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask. Smoking in the working area is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling barium.|$|E
25|$|For {{the most}} {{powerful}} black powder, meal powder, a wood charcoal, is used. The best wood for the purpose is Pacific willow, but others such as alder or buckthorn can be used. In Great Britain between the 15th and 19th centuries charcoal from alder buckthorn was greatly prized for gunpowder manufacture; cottonwood {{was used by the}} American Confederate States. The ingredients are reduced in particle size and mixed as intimately as possible. Originally, this was with a mortar-and-pestle or a similarly operating stamping-mill, using copper, bronze or other <b>non-sparking</b> materials, until supplanted by the rotating ball mill principle with <b>non-sparking</b> bronze or lead. Historically, a marble or limestone edge runner mill, running on a limestone bed, was used in Great Britain; however, by the mid 19th century this had changed to either an iron-shod stone wheel or a cast iron wheel running on an iron bed. The mix was dampened with alcohol or water during grinding to prevent accidental ignition. This also helps the extremely soluble saltpeter to mix into the microscopic nooks and crannies of the very high surface-area charcoal.|$|E
30|$|It is {{difficult}} to predict the failure of <b>non-Spark</b> JVM; therefore, we must keep data flow to the lowest level. For instance, installing JVM in any computer may take up to 25 % of the total memory. This size can be reconfigured and enlarged if needed. If the Spark worker memory {{is large enough to}} fit the data size, then the external JVM that handles the UDF may be able to handle up to 25 % of the data size located in Spark. The size of the UDF heap memory is not the only obstacle—the complex iteration with several IF statements can be another cumbersome factor that degrades the data processes. MDSBA implements a swift algorithm to anonymize data with the minimum number of iterations.|$|R
40|$|BERYLLIUM {{poisoning}} is {{an industrial}} hazard which {{has appeared in}} the United States during the past 10 years. Beryllium compounds are commonly found in fluorescent lamps, radio, electronic and x-ray tubes, alloys and <b>non-spark</b> tools. 1 The metal is lighter (specific gravity, 1. 85) than aluminum (specific gravity, 2. 70). 4 Soluble dusts and fumes produce acute pneumonia and dermatitis. In-soluble dust in the lungs causes a slow development of granulomatosis. 2 The fibrosis of the lungs may develop over a period of years. 5 Particles embedded in the tissue require surgical excision for cure. 3 No suitable treatment was found before cortisone or ACTH.

40|$|Spontaneous Ca 2 + {{waves in}} cardiac muscle cells {{are thought to}} arise from the {{sequential}} firing of local Ca 2 + sparks via a fire-diffuse-fire mechanism. This study compares {{the ability of the}} ryanodine receptor (RyR) blocker ruthenium red (RuR) to inhibit these two types of Ca 2 + release in permeabilised rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes. Perfusing with 600 nm Ca 2 + (50 mu m EGTA) caused regular spontaneous Ca 2 + waves that were imaged with the fluorescence from Fluo- 5 F using a laser-scanning confocal microscope. Addition of 4 mu m RuR caused complete inhibition of Ca 2 + waves in 50 % of cardiomyocytes by 2 min and in 100 % by 4 min. Separate experiments used 350 mu m EGTA (600 nm Ca 2 +) to limit Ca 2 + diffusion but allow the underlying Ca 2 + sparks to be imaged. The time course of RuR-induced inhibition did not match that of waves. After 2 min of RuR, none of the characteristics of the Ca 2 + sparks were altered, and after 4 min Ca 2 + spark frequency was reduced similar to 40 %; no sparks could be detected after 10 min. Measurements of Ca 2 + within the SR lumen using Fluo- 5 N showed an increase in intra-SR Ca 2 + during the initial 2 - 4 min of perfusion with RuR in both wave and spark conditions. Computational modelling suggests that the sensitivity of Ca 2 + waves to RuR block depends on the number of RyRs per cluster. Therefore inhibition of Ca 2 + waves without affecting Ca 2 + sparks may be explained by block of small, <b>non-spark</b> producing clusters of RyRs that are important to the process of Ca 2 + wave propagation. status: publishe...|$|R
2500|$|In 1886, Frank Julian Sprague {{invented the}} first {{practical}} DC motor, a <b>non-sparking</b> motor that maintained relatively constant speed under variable loads. Other Sprague electric inventions {{about this time}} greatly improved grid electric distribution (prior work done while employed by Thomas Edison), allowed power from electric motors {{to be returned to}} the electric grid, provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole, and provided controls systems for electric operations. This allowed Sprague to use electric motors to invent the first electric trolley system in 1887–88 in Richmond VA, the electric elevator and control system in 1892, and the electric subway with independently powered centrally controlled cars, which were first installed in 1892 in Chicago by the South Side Elevated Railway where it became popularly known as the [...] "L". Sprague's motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry, while almost simultaneously another great inventor was developing its primary competitor, which would become much more widespread.|$|E

40|$|Sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) Ca 2 + leak is {{an important}} component of cardiac Ca 2 + signalling. Together with the SR Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA) -mediated Ca 2 + uptake, diastolic Ca 2 + leak determines SR Ca 2 + load and, therefore, the amplitude of Ca 2 + transients that initiate contraction. Spontaneous Ca 2 + sparks are thought {{to play a major role}} in SR Ca 2 + leak. In this study, we determined the quantitative contribution of sparks to SR Ca 2 + leak and tested the hypothesis that <b>non-spark</b> mediated Ca 2 + release also contributes to SR Ca 2 + leak. We simultaneously measured spark properties and intra-SR free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]SR) after complete inhibition of SERCA with thapsigargin in permeabilized rabbit ventricular myocytes. When [Ca 2 +]SR declined to 279 ± 10 μm, spark activity ceased completely; however SR Ca 2 + leak continued, albeit at a slower rate. Analysis of sparks and [Ca 2 +]SR revealed, that SR Ca 2 + leak increased as a function of [Ca 2 +]SR, with a particularly steep increase at higher [Ca 2 +]SR (> 600 μm) where sparks become a major pathway of SR Ca 2 + leak. At low [Ca 2 +]SR (< 300 μm), however, Ca 2 + leak occurred mostly as non-spark-mediated leak. Sensitization of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) with low doses of caffeine increased spark frequency and SR Ca 2 + leak. Complete inhibition of RyR abolished sparks and significantly decreased SR Ca 2 + leak, but did not prevent it entirely, suggesting the existence of RyR-independent Ca 2 + leak. Finally, we found that RyR-mediated Ca 2 + leak was enhanced in myocytes from failing rabbit hearts. These results show that RyRs are the main, but not sole contributor to SR Ca 2 + leak. RyR-mediated leak occurs in part as Ca 2 + sparks, but there is clearly RyR-mediated but Ca 2 + sparks independent leak...|$|R
