40|$|Objectives The study {{examined}} the course of <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain among a cohort of technical school students entering working life. We also aimed to identify work-related and individual risk factors for <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain during this transition period. Methods The study {{was designed as a}} prospective cohort study following 420 technical school students (167 student hairdressers, 118 student electricians, and 135 media/design students) from school, through their apprenticeship and into working life. Every 4 th month over a 6. 5 year period (2002 – 2009), the participant`s <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain for the preceding four weeks was assessed. Mechanical and psychosocial workplace factors as well as individual factors were evaluated at baseline and/or during the follow-up period. Data were analyzed by generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results We found a significant increase in <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain over time in the transition from technical school to working life. High mechanical workload was associated with <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain among women, while a high level of shoulder muscle endurance capacity was associated with lower rates of <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain among men. Perceived muscle tension and ethnicity were the most consistent predictors for <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain, found among both women and men. Conclusion Increased <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain was found in the transition from technical school to working life, and both work-related and individual factors were associated with pain development.

40|$|Repetitive and {{monotonous}} work is frequently associated with <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain <b>and</b> negative psychosocial factors inducing stress reactions. The present thesis concerns {{the relations between}} psychophysiological and subjective stress reactions, muscle activity measured by surface electromyography (SEMG) in the trapezius muscle, <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain in women performing repetitive and {{monotonous work}}. In Study I cardiovascular and subjective stress reactions were investigated during computer work in a laboratory setting. The findings indicated that heart rate variability is a more sensitive and selective measure of mental stress compared with blood pressure recordings. Study II explored the relations between stress reactions and muscle activity during supermarket work. The results showed that perceived negative stress reactions may have a specific influence on muscle activity in the <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> region, which can be of importance for work-related musculoskeletal disorders in repetitive and monotonous work. In Study III the association between SEMG activity patterns <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain was investigated during cash register work. It was found that pain-afflicted women had a different muscle activation pattern (more static, more co-contraction, less muscle rest) compared with pain-free women. Study IV was a follow-up study evaluating the introduction of job rotation among female cashiers. The results indicated positive effects on diastolic blood pressure, muscle activity, <b>and</b> partly on <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain, although perceived stress was unchanged. It was concluded that job rotation {{seems to have a}} limited effect on chronic <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain, but may be an effective preventive measure. The empirical findings are particularly relevant for women who, compared with men, more often perform repetitive and monotonous work and are also more often affected by <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain...|$|R
40|$|Background: Musculoskeletal pain is {{prevalent}} both {{in adolescents}} {{and in the}} general working population. The <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> region is most commonly affected. Mechanical workload such as work in awkward postures, sustained work with hands above shoulder level, heavy lifting and repetitive work have previously been acknowledged as risk factors in adult working populations. The results have mainly been based on self-reported exposure data and the duration and intensity of the exposure is often disregarded. Young workers report more mechanical work exposures than older workers and the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain among young adults is increasing. It has however been very few studies investigating the mechanical workload as {{a risk factor for}} <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain among young workers. Objective: This dissertation focuses on <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain in a cohort of young adults during their transition from technical school to working life. The aim was to explore the relationship between mechanical workload <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain, using three different measures of work exposure. Methods: The cohort consisted of 420 technical school students (representing student hairdressers, student electricians and media/design students) from the greater Oslo area. They were followed over a 6. 5 year period from technical school into working life. Every 4 th month during the study period <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain was assessed by questionnaire. Approximately halfway in the follow-up period, a technical field measurement was performed assessing the mechanical workload objectively on a subsample of 43 subjects. Paper I included the entire cohort that was followed 6. 5 years. The mechanical workload was assessed by questionnaire approximately twice a year in the follow-up period. Paper II was based on the subsample. Surface electromyography on the upper trapezius muscle was measured during a whole working day. The relative time with sustained muscle activity for periods lasting > 4 minutes was used in the analyses. The <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain was assessed every 4 th month during 2. 5 years of follow-up. Paper III was also based on the subsample. Mechanical workload was measured using bilateral inclinometers on the upper arms. The relative time of work with prolonged arm elevation > 60 ° and > 90 ° were used in the analyses. The shoulder pain was assessed by pain drawings every year during the 2. 5 year follow-up. Results: An increase in <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain among young workers during their transition from technical school to working life was found. The pain severity levels reported were however relatively low, especially among men. Paper I showed that self-reported mechanical workload was associated with <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain. Stratifying by gender the association was significant among women. Perceived muscle tension was associated with <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain in both genders while clinically tested shoulder muscle endurance was negatively associated with <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain among men. In Paper II the results showed that high levels of sustained trapezius muscle activity during work was associated with <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain. Paper III showed that time with prolonged arm elevation > 60 ° was associated with shoulder pain, however only significant among women. Conclusions: The main conclusion from the three papers in this dissertation was that both self-reported and objectively measured mechanical workload was associated with <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain {{in the first years of}} working life, especially among women. The objectively measured sustained muscle activity during work and perceived muscle tension was associated with <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain in both genders. It was also evident from this dissertation that the <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain increases during the transition from technical school to working life. Even though the reported pain severity levels were relatively low, the findings suggests that mechanical workload is a risk factor already early in working life. This may indicate the need for attention on the work environment among young workers particularly those in manual working environments...|$|R

5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Sympathetic nervous {{activity}} {{contributes to}} the maintenance of muscle oxygenation. However, patients with chronic pain may suffer from autonomic dysfunction. Furthermore, insufficient muscle oxygenation is observed among workers with chronic <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain. The aim of our study was to investigate how muscle load tasks affect sympathetic nervous activity and changes in oxygenation of the trapezius muscles in subjects with chronic <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain. Methods Thirty females were assigned to two groups: a pain group consisting of subjects with chronic <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain <b>and</b> a control group consisting of asymptomatic subjects. The participants performed three sets of isometric exercise in an upright position; they contracted their trapezius muscles with maximum effort and let the muscles relax (Relax). Autonomic nervous activity and oxygenation of the trapezius muscles were measured by heart rate variability (HRV) and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy. Results Oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin of the trapezius muscles in the pain group were lower during the Relax period compared with the control group. In addition, the low frequency / high frequency (LF/HF) ratio of HRV significantly increased during isometric exercise in the control group, whereas there were no significant changes in the pain group. Conclusions Subjects with <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain showed lower oxygenation and blood flow of the trapezius muscles responding to isometric exercise, compared with asymptomatic subjects. Subjects with <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain also showed no significant changes in the LF/HF ratio of HRV responding to isometric exercise, which would imply a reduction in sympathetic nervous activity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} if sustained trapezius muscle activity predicts <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain over a 2. 5 -year period. Methods Forty young adults (15 hairdressers, 14 electricians, 5 students and 6 with various work) were followed {{during their first}} years of working life. Self-reported <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain during the last four weeks was assessed seven times over the observational period. Upper-trapezius muscle activity was measured during a full working day by bilateral surface electromyography (EMG) at baseline (winter 2006 / 7). Sustained trapezius muscle activity was defined as continuous muscle activity with amplitude > 0. 5 % EMGmax lasting > 4 minutes. The relative time of sustained muscle activity during the working day was calculated and further classified into low (0 – 29 %), moderate (30 – 49 %) and high (50 – 100 %) level groups. Results Generalized estimating equations (GEE), adjusted for time, gender, mechanical workload, control-over-work intensity, physical activity, tobacco use, <b>and</b> prior <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain, showed that participants {{with a high level}} of sustained muscle activity had a rate of <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain three times higher than the low level group during a 2. 5 -year period. The association was strongest at the same time and shortly after the EMG measurement, indicating a time-lag of ≤ 6 months.

The objective {{of the present study was}} to confirm the long-term (14 months from the beginning of the study) benefit of the program in the intervention arm of the study (192 office employees). Outcome measures of the present analyses were: 1) the number of days/month with headache, <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain; 2) the frequency of days with analgesic drug consumption; 3) the proportion of subjects with 4 or more days/month with headache or <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain at baseline who achieved a ≥ 50 % reduction in pain (responder rate). Days/month with headache decreased from 5. 50 at baseline (months 1 - 2) to 3. 11 at months 13 - 14 (P <. 001); from 6. 79 to 3. 88 (P <. 001) for <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain; <b>and</b> from 1. 72 to 0. 86 (P <. 001) for analgesic consumption.

After 2 months, the study group only began the educational and physical programme. The primary end-point was the change in frequency of headache <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain expressed as the number of days per month with pain, and as the proportion of subjects with a ≥ 50 % reduction of frequency (responder rate). The number of days of analgesic drug consumption was also recorded. Diaries completed for the whole 8 months were available for 169 subjects in the study group and 175 controls. The baseline frequency of headache (days per month) was 5. 87 and 6. 30 in the study group and in controls; frequency of <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain was 7. 12 and 7. 79, respectively. Mean treatment effects [days per month, 95 % confidence interval (CI) ] on comparing the last 2 months vs. baseline were: headache frequency - 2. 45 (- 3. 48, - 1. 43); frequency of neck pain - 2. 62 (- 4. 09, - 1. 16); responder rates (odds ratio, 95 % CI) 5. 51 (2. 75, 11) for headache, 3. 10 (1. 65, 5. 81) for <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain, <b>and</b> 3. 08 (1. 06, 8. 90) for days with analgesic drug consumption. The study suggests that an educational and physical programme reduces headache <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> pain in a working community. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2008...|$|R
