One of these major sources of funding has come from foundations, which have increasingly become more committed to <b>neglected</b> <b>disease</b> drug discovery in the 21st century. In 2012, philanthropic sources provided 15.9% of the total funding. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been a leader in providing funding for <b>neglected</b> <b>disease</b> drug development.

25|$|In 1966, {{a report}} called Accidental Death and Disability: The <b>Neglected</b> <b>Disease</b> of Modern Society—commonly known as The White Paper—was {{published}} in the United States.

25|$|Another {{important}} component of increased interest and funding has come from industry. In 2012, they contributed 13.1% total to the kinetoplastid research and development effort, and have additionally {{played an important role}} by contributing to public-private partnerships (PPP) as well as product-development partnerships (PDP). A public-private partnership is an arrangement between one or more public entities and one or more private entities that exists to achieve a specific health outcome or to produce a health product. The partnership can exist in numerous ways; they may share and exchange funds, property, equipment, human resources, and intellectual property. These public-private partnerships and product-development partnerships have been established to address challenges in pharmaceutical industry, especially related to <b>neglected</b> <b>disease</b> research. These partnerships can help increase the scale of the effort towards therapeutic development by using different knowledge, skills, and expertise from different sources. These types of partnerships {{have been shown to be}} more effective than industry or public groups working independently.|$|E

40|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) and Medecins Sans Frontieres {{recently}} have proposed the term <b>neglected</b> <b>diseases,</b> referring {{to those that}} have a higher occurrence in the developing countries and most neglected, exclusive of developing countries.

It also analyzes the federal government spending on medicines to treat those diseases, identifying the drugs, dosage forms and their respective costs in the period 2005 to 2008. In this sense, it is observed that despite the high incidence of <b>neglected</b> <b>diseases</b> in Brazil, spending of the Ministry of Health on medicines for the pharmaceutical assistance programs for <b>neglected</b> <b>diseases</b> is scarce if compared to spending on other programs, such as AIDS, for example. It is believed that it reflects the lack of new drugs for the treatment of <b>neglected</b> <b>diseases,</b> that would be, therefore, subject to patent protection, and, consequently, more expensive. On the other hand, Brazil is one of the developing countries that invests more on research of new treatments for <b>neglected</b> <b>diseases.</b> As it has been done on other countries, it could be proposed Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for R&D on <b>neglected</b> <b>diseases</b> in Brazil, once this country is directly interested in the possible products of such partnerships and has the technical capability to do so...|$|R

One well-known report in the USA during that time was Accidental Death and Disability: The <b>Neglected</b> <b>Disease</b> of Modern Society. This report is commonly known as The White Paper.

While some areas ambulances were staffed by advanced first-aid-level responders, in other areas, it was common for the local undertaker, having the only transport in town in which one could lie down, to operate both the local furniture store (where he would make coffins as a sideline) and the local ambulance service. The government reports resulted in the creation of standards in ambulance construction concerning the internal height of the patient care area (to allow for an attendant to continue to care for the patient during transport), and the equipment (and thus weight) that an ambulance had to carry, and several other factors.|$|E

His besetting sin gained so fast upon him, however, that it was found impossible to employ him in the situations in which he really was useful to the theatre.

To this mode of life the man was compelled to resort; and taking the chair every night, at some low theatrical house, at once put him in possession of a few more shillings weekly, and enabled him to gratify his old propensity. Even this resource shortly failed him; his irregularities were too great to admit of his earning the wretched pittance he might thus have procured, and he was actually reduced to a state bordering on starvation, only procuring a trifle occasionally by borrowing it of some old companion, or by obtaining an appearance at one or other of the commonest of the minor theatres; and when he did earn anything it was spent in the old way.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background People {{living in}} poverty {{throughout}} the developing world are heavily burdened with <b>neglected</b> communicable <b>diseases</b> and often marginalized by the health sector. These diseases are currently referred to as <b>Neglected</b> <b>Diseases</b> of <b>Neglected</b> Populations. The <b>neglected</b> <b>diseases</b> create social and financial burdens to the individual, the family, the community, and the nation. Discussion Numerous studies of successful individual interventions to manage communicable disease determinants in various types of communities have been published, but few have applied multiple interventions in an integrated, coordinated manner. We have identified a series of successful interventions and developed three hypothetical scenarios where such interventions could be applied in an integrated, multi-disease, inter-programmatic, and/or inter-sectoral approach for prevention and control of <b>neglected</b> <b>diseases</b> in three different populations: a slum, an indigenous community, and {{a city with a}} mix of populations. Summary The objective {{of this paper is to}} identify new opportunities to address <b>neglected</b> <b>diseases,</b> improve community health and promote sustainable development in neglected populations by highlighting examples of key risk and protective factors for <b>neglected</b> <b>diseases</b> which can be managed and implemented through multi-disease-based, integrated, inter-programmatic, and/or inter-sectoral approaches. Based on a literature review, analysis and development of scenarios we visualize how multiple interventions could manage multiple disease problems and propose these as possible strategies to be tested. We seek to stimulate intra- and inter-sectoral dialogue which will help in the construction of new strategies for <b>neglected</b> <b>diseases</b> (particularly for the parasitic diseases) which could benefit the poor and marginalized based on the principle of sustainability and understanding of key determinants of health, and lead to the establishment of pilot projects and activities which can contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. </p...|$|R
