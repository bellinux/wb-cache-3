40|$|Abstract Wind power {{meteorology}} {{has evolved}} as an applied science, firmly founded on boundary-layer meteorology, but with strong links to climatology and geography. It concerns itself with three main areas: siting of wind turbines, regional wind resource assessment, and short-term prediction {{of the wind}} resource. The history, status and perspectives of wind power meteorology are presented, with emphasis on physical considerations and on its practical application. Following a global view of the wind resource, the elements of boundary layer meteorology which are most important for wind energy are reviewed: wind profiles and shear, turbulence and gust, and extreme winds. The data used in wind power meteorology stem mainly from three sources: onsite wind measurements, the synoptic networks, and the re-analysis projects. Wind climate analysis, wind resource estimation and siting further require {{a detailed description of}} the topography of the terrain â€“ with respect to the roughness of the surface, <b>near-by</b> <b>obstacles,</b> and orographical features. Finally, the meteorological models used for estimation and prediction of the wind are described; their classification...|$|E
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis presents various methods of wind data analysis. Its first part summarizes the undesirable {{factors that influence}} the measured wind data. In particular, the effects of anemometer placement {{with regard to the}} <b>near-by</b> <b>obstacles</b> are investigated. In addition to the theoretical review, the practical examples of analysis of these effects at the wind mast measurements are demonstrated. The second part is focused on the measure-correlate-predict methods. Two original matrix-type methods are presented. Furthermore, a comparison of accuracy of measure-correlate-predict methods for various types of reference data series, various methods and various configurations of applied methods has been performed. The reanalyzed wind proved to be a suitable source of reference data in most cases. The applicability of surface wind data from meteorological stations depends on the combination of reference and target series, {{as well as on the}} homogeneity of involved data. The newly introduced methods proved to be suitable and universal tool for measure-correlate-predict application. The final part of the thesis analyses the wind conditions over the Czech Republic. Besides to the overview of the knowledge of the Czech wind climate, the calculation of the wind map of the Czech Republic is described. The final map was [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of falling technology prices and government financial incentives {{has led to}} the rapid expansion of the solar microgeneration industry in the UK and around the world. With conditions for investment becoming more favourable, viability appraisal is now of great interest to potential investors ranging from individuals to large companies and authorities. A methodology to predict solar resource available to solar technologies in urban areas is presented that combines a radiative transfer simulation with shading derived from digital surface model (DSM) data. The radiative transfer simulation includes water vapour, ozone, clouds and surface albedo determined from MODIS satellite products along with aerosol properties that are derived from the GLOMAP model. A DSM is used to calculate the height of <b>near-by</b> <b>obstacles</b> and the horizon from each point of interest to establish when the site is in shade during a year. The site-level radiance field is adjusted by elements in shade and integrated over the view hemisphere of the photovoltaic (PV) panels to take into account panel tilt. Modelled annual global radiation (Wh/m 2 /a) estimations are validated using power output data from 17 sites across four major UK cities (Bristol, Cambridge, Leeds and Sheffield) and show good agreement with - 3. 68 % and + 2. 62 % mean percentage error under assumed performance ratio conversions of 0. 75 and 0. 8 respectively. The results are compared to the outputs of both Esri ArcGIS and PVGIS, the first of which predicted annual global radiation with - 15. 97 % and - 20. 78 % mean percentage error with the latter returning + 3. 34 % and + 10. 23 % mean percentage error for the 0. 75 and 0. 8 performance ratios...|$|E
