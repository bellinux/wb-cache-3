40|$|Trends and {{district}} {{variations in the}} pre-hospital and hospital care of children aged 0 - 14 years admitted with acute asthma were surveyed in all 13 districts of a health region by examining case notes for 1970, 1978, and 1985. From 1970 to 1985 there was {{a substantial increase in}} admissions and some reduction of hospital stay. Over this time adrenergic drugs remained the most frequently used treatment with a large shift towards selective beta 2 agonists administered by <b>nebulisation.</b> <b>Use</b> of corticosteroids fell in the under 5 s with a decrease in the parenteral route of administration but rose in the 5 - 14 age group with an increase in the oral route of administration. There was an increase the use of oral xanthines but this was outweighed by falls in the use of suppositories and in parenteral administration. The use of antibiotics became less frequent and that of sedatives and antihistamines fell to almost nil. There were also important changes in other aspects of management, notably an increase in the use of lung function tests (from 3 % to 70 %) and falls in the use of chest radiographs, blood tests, bacteriology, and physiotherapy. In nearly all aspects of management there were significant and often very extreme variations in practice between districts, which were unlikely to be explained by differences in morbidity. These variations would be a suitable focus for medical audit, with the aim of establishing which treatment regimens have the best outcome and avoiding unnecessary cost and discomfort. Because early hospital drug treatment is closely related to the type of treatment given before admission such audit activities would need to include general practitioners...|$|E
40|$|A new {{inhalation}} synchronised dosimeter {{triggered by}} low inspiratory flow rates has been assessed. The methacholine challenge test <b>using</b> dosimeter <b>nebulisation</b> with controlled tidal breathing was compared with continuous <b>nebulisation</b> <b>using</b> De Vilbiss No 40 nebulisers with deep inhalations in 11 asthmatic subjects. Within subject PD 20 FEV 1 values were lower with the dosimeter method {{than with the}} continuous nebulisation method (geometric means 158 and 588 micrograms). The repeatability of the dosimeter method with controlled tidal breathing was studied in 11 asthmatic subjects, and the 95 % range for a single measurement was +/- 0. 72 doubling doses of methacholine. The dosimeter method has greater efficacy because aerosol is delivered during {{the first part of}} an inhalation, minimising loss of aerosol outside the respiratory tract. The dosimeter technique combined with controlled tidal breathing appears to be a useful method for carrying out standardised non-specific bronchoprovocation tests...|$|R
40|$|The simple {{fluorinated}} precursor, copper(II) trifluoroacetate, Cu(CF 3 COO) 2 can {{be effectively}} utilised in {{the synthesis of}} Copper(I) nitride, Cu 3 N, powders and films by combinations of wet processing and gas-solid (ammonolysis) techniques. The resulting materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectroscopy (DRUV-Vis), Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy (IR), thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis-mass spectrometry (TG-DTA-MS) and nitrogen adsorption (BET) analysis. Moreover, variable temperature IR (VT-IR) studies of the solid phase were performed in situ during ammonolysis. Single-phase Cu 3 N powders composed of sub-micron scale platelets can be produced over relatively short reaction times. Materials prepared in this way are stoichiometric narrow band gap semiconductors. The same trifluoroacetate precursor was used to prepare nanostructured nitride films by dip coating. The surface microstructure was investigated and evaluated relative to films deposited by spin coating and <b>nebulisation</b> <b>using</b> soluble carboxylate precursors...|$|R
40|$|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) {{is one of}} the commonest {{long-term}} conditions worldwide. It is characterised by chronic airflow limitation, pathological {{changes in}} the lung and significant extra-pulmonary manifestations. The treatment of an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), involves glucocorticoids and bronchodilators supplemented by antibiotics if needed. In-hospital, oxygen, which has potential risks as well as benefits, and additional respiratory support can be given if the patient deteriorates. Clinicians need to decide which treatment to provide and who can be safely discharged. This has led to the advent of scoring systems to define severity in COPD This thesis examines the evidence base for the use of magnesium in airways disease and presents the results of the first randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial using nebulised magnesium in the treatment of AECOPD. 116 patients were randomised, but after 3 nebulisations over 90 minutes, {{there was no significant difference}} in FEV 1 compared to placebo (p= 0. 67). In a second study, the CRB 65 score was retrospectively assigned to a cohort of patients presenting to the emergency department with AECOPD, using data collected from a previous audit. Patients with a CRB 65 score of 0 or 1 had a low risk of in-hospital and 30 - day mortality and could be considered for discharge, whereas those with scores between 2 - 4 required admission with mortality increasing with the score. The CRB 65 score showed a similar utility in AECOPD as it does in pneumonia. Finally, 18 subjects with stable but severe COPD were randomised in a crossover study to two nebulisations with salbutamol and ipratropium over 15 minutes with a five minute interval between <b>nebulisations,</b> <b>using</b> air or oxygen as the driving gas. When oxygen was used there was a 3. 1 mmHg difference (p< 0. 001) at 35 minutes, compared to air, illustrating the potential risks of repeated nebulisations to those with severe COPD...|$|R
40|$|SummaryA {{survey of}} {{nebulisation}} practice in France was conducted {{under the aegis}} of the French respiratory society in 2004. MethodsAnalysis of a questionnaire was obtained from 3674 physicians. ResultsA total of 2439 physicians were general practitioners (GPs), 698 were chest physicians, and 537 paediatricians. The main reasons to <b>use</b> <b>nebulisation</b> are (1) for chest physicians efficacy in treating various pathologies with long-term administration (1 wk to ⩾ 1 month) of approved drugs, and (2) for GP's local action properties. While chest physicians learned about nebulisation during their university training and do not ask for additional information, GPs learned by practical experience or from colleagues and ask for further information. ConclusionThis study will help to develop targeted educational programmes on nebulisation practice...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: In asthma exacerbations, higher {{doses of}} inhaled {{beta-agonists}} {{are used to}} overcome acute bronchoconstriction. Traditionally, wet <b>nebulisation</b> has been <b>used,</b> but metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is an alternative delivery method. Objective: To compare the clinical outcomes in adults and children with acute asthma, presenting in emergency departments or in the community, who have been randomised to beta-agonists given by two different delivery. Methods: a metered-dose inhaler with spacer or a nebuliser. Results: A Cochrane review has found no important {{differences between the two}} delivery methods in adults. Children may suffer fewer side effects with spacer delivery. Conclusions: Individual response to treatment cannot be predicted, but many studies overcame this problem by using frequent repeated doses of beta-agonists (one respule via nebuliser or four separate actuations of a metered-dose inhaler through a spacer) every 10 – 15 min, titrated against the clinical response of the patients. This approach is advocated in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|High density micron sized {{aerosols}} from liquid surfaces {{were generated}} using {{surface acoustic wave}} (SAW) nebulisation. The SAWs are made from a set of interdigitated electrodes (IDT) deposited on a lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) substrate and are designed to operate around 10 MHz. RF powers of ~ 235 mW are <b>used</b> to achieve <b>nebulisation.</b> Power below this results in droplet motion across the substrate surface. The nebulisation process generated aerosols of a narrow size distribution with diameter ranging from 0. 5 - 2 µm. We consider ways in which these aerosols can be loaded into optical traps for further study. In particular we look at how SAW <b>nebulisation</b> can be <b>used</b> to load particles into a trap in a far more robust manner than a conventional nebuliser device. We demonstrate trapping {{of a range of}} particle types and sizes and analyse the size distribution of particles {{as a function of the}} applied frequency to the SAW device. We show that it is simpler to load, in particular, solid particles into optical traps using this technique compared to conventional nebulisation. We also consider the possibilities for loading nanoparticles into aerosol optical tweezers...|$|R
40|$|Mucociliary {{clearance}} is {{compromised by}} airway surface liquid dehydration in respiratory disease {{states such as}} cystic fibrosis. Rehydration by hyperosmolar agents such as nebulised hypertonic saline and dry powder mannitol has demonstrated in vivo safety and efficacy for restoring mucociliary function. Mannitol, delivered as a nebulised formulation for this purpose, has not been investigated as yet. The current study examines the feasibility of delivering such a formulation using recent vibrating mesh technology. <b>Nebulisation</b> was conducted <b>using</b> an Aeroneb Go TM vibrating mesh nebuliser, and aerosol size was assessed by laser diffraction. Cascade impaction coupled with mass assay by high-performance liquid chromatography was used to confirm fluid uniformity and correlation with laser diffraction sizing. The following nebuliser formulations were prepared and aerosolised: deionised water, mannitol (150 mg/mL) aqueous solution, sodium chloride aqueous solution [0. 2 %, 1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 7 % (w/v) ] and mannitol (150 mg/mL) in sodium chloride solution [0. 2 %, 1 %, 3 %, 7 % (w/v) ]. Mannitol aqueous solution was poorly nebulised, resulting in lengthy treatment times and large median droplet size. Addition of sodium chloride drastically improved nebuliser performance and aerosol characteristics. In vivo studies are necessary to confirm efficacy of nebulised mannitol. If substantiated, it could provide a pleasant-tasting alternative mucoactive agent with prolonged therapeutic action. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Inductively coupled plasma atomic {{emission}} spectrometry {{has been investigated}} for solution, slurry and speciation analysis. It {{has been shown that}} it is possible to optimise a simultaneous multielement analysis for slurry and solution samples using solid state detection and optimisation algorithms. A range of certified reference materials have been analysed using optimum conditions and results were in good agreement with certified values. Slurry <b>nebulisation</b> has been <b>used</b> for the first time in the analysis of NIST SRM Total Diet' and carbon black samples. Both radially and axially viewed ICP spectrometers were used in these studies. Modifications of the mass transport efficiency of solutions and slurries through the sample introduction system was illustrated upon EIE addition. The transport phenomenon was found to be dependent on the matrix element and not on the analyte of interest. A decrease in transport efficiency was found to be related to the mass of the EIE added. Solution and slurry atom and ion line intensity ratios obtained from an axially viewed ICP were used to illustrate emission enhancement when Mg was used as the thermometric species of interest. Enhancement was found to be spatially dependent and the energy transfer processes governing excitation were modified upon EIE addition. The magnitude of the enhancement effects for solutions and slurries differed, once transport effects had been negated, and this was attributed to variations in atomisation efficiency. A radially viewed ICP spectrometer was also used to monitor the effect of ElEs on solutions and slurries. The Abel integral technique was used to transform lateral profiles and Fe atom line ratios were calculated. 'Real' enhancement effects were apparent upon EIE addition when transport effects had again been negated. The plasma excitation temperature was used as a physical marker to determine the effect of EIE addition on solutions and slurries of Fe. The variation in Texc upon EIE addition was small but showed an increasing trend from Li to Cs. Radially obtained values of Texc were lower than literature values whereas preliminary values obtained axially compared well. It has been demonstrated that transient signal data may be obtained from an array-based spectrometer for speciation studies. The feasibility of reverse phase and size exclusion HPLC-ICP-AES has been demonstrated for the separation of a selection of organosilicon species of various molecular weights. Detection limits were in the range 0. 1 to 5 ug ml- 1 for a radially viewed plasma. The use of axial viewing when aspirating organic solvents as part of the mobile phase yields higher limits of detection owing to the noise that is measured.

40|$|This study {{provides}} an overview on the drugs used by a significant sample of families from Mottola, a town of about 16, 000 inhabitants in the Province of Taranto. The main purpose of the study, {{in addition to the}} involvement of young people and local professionals in the data collection phase, was to assess the validity and appropriateness of the allocation of drugs to foster a greater awareness of their use, and also to gather information on the drugs expired in sight of reducing leftover and reuse as research and education tools. The survey, conducted between late 2012 and early 2013, involved 156 families for a total of 487 people, a significant sample corresponding to 3 % of the population. People involved in the survey were generally interested in the topic. In regard to the use of health facilities for first aid, {{it should be noted that}} about 62 % of people use sodium hypochlorite and denatured ethyl alcohol as disinfectants. Some medical devices were widely present; in particular, the device for <b>nebulisation</b> of drugs <b>used</b> to treat respiratory tract disorders was present in 81. 4 % of households. The drugs for first aid generally belonged to the C band of SSN classification (with some exceptions such as lansoprazole, used as a gastric protector); only 27 % of the above was provided by SSN. The drugs found in the sample families were mainly represented by antipyretics, anti-inflammatories and painkillers (44 %), and of the gastrointestinal tract medicines (28 %). The drugs devoted to the treatment of specific diseases were present with 6. 1 packs per family, compared to 8. 2 packs for drugs of first aid. Examining the distribution of drugs in the various ATC categories, the highest rates were found for the cardiovascular system (16. 7 % with a peak of 30 % in the last age group), eating disorders and metabolism (11. 5 %) and respiratory tract (11. 0 %) drugs. The expired drugs amounted to an average of a pack per family with a residual of 44 % of the overall content, for those of first aid, and 0. 7 packs with a residual 59 %, for medicines used for specific diseases. A comparison of the percentages of expired drugs and those in use highlights that the use of NSAIDs is a nearly exhaustive, insignificant percentage NSAIDs expired being found. The results were discussed in relation with: the tendency to self-medication and the opportunity to improve the awareness of citizens; the possibility of response to economic hardship, evidenced by the 16. 7 % of respondents; the opportunity for the recovery of active principles from expired drugs in order to reduce environmental pollution; the importance of a participatory management of research...|$|R
