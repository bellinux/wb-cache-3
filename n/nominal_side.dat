40|$|A general {{equilibrium}} monetary {{economy is}} described that exhibits equilibrium growth. The production technology {{is consistent with}} Jones and Manuelli (1990) and Rebelo (1991). The inflation tax and nominal interest rates are shown to be inversely related to the equilibrium growth rates of real variables until a critical point is reached. At this point, equilibrium growth is eliminated and the predictions of Stockman (1981) and Abel (1985) concerning the 'level effects' of distortionary monetary policies appear. For the <b>nominal</b> <b>side</b> of the model, {{a version of the}} prediction of Friedman (1969) is shown to hold for a particular balanced growth path.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to measure the}} relative significance of structural shocks in explaining inflation. We use monthly time series data on key macroeconomic variables of Pakistan from July 1992 to June 2011, and structural vector auto-regressions (SVAR) to understand the role {{of supply and demand}} shocks as key drivers of inflation. Long-run restrictions according to standard aggregate demand and aggregate supply framework are employed to identify structural shocks in the system. The results indicate that inflation follows a sluggish time path in response to supply shock as compared to demand shock of nominal nature. Specifically, around 75 percent of long-run impact of supply shock on inflation is realized over a period of one year horizon as compared with 90 percent for demand shock. In terms of relative significance, supply side disturbances explain 48 percent of variation in inflation over the estimation period. Within demand <b>side,</b> <b>nominal</b> shocks are relatively more important than the real demand shock. The share of real demand shock was around 10 percent, while the reaming 42 percent was attributed to nominal shock.

40|$|Empirical {{studies show}} that the Federal Reserve System (Fed) has been {{smoothing}} short-term nominal interest rates across seasonal cycles, but has allowed interest rates to co-move with output over business cycles, despite striking similarities between the two cycles in terms of output co-movements and relative volatilities. This paper tries to explain why the Fed has been treating the two cycles so differently. To address this issue, I first construct a monetary growth model which replicates the seasonal and cyclical patterns of aggregate U. S. data. Then I use the model to compare the historical U. S. monetary policy with two alternative policy rules, namely the constant-interest-rate rule proposed by Carlstrom and Fuerst (1996), and the constant-money-growth rule advocated by Friedman (1959, 1982). Both alternatives are constrained to generate the same seigniorage revenue as the historical policy. Numerical simulations show that (l) the model captures both the real and nominal features of U. S. data quite well and it outperforms traditional cash-in-advance models in replicating the nominal variables; and (2) the historical monetary policy attains higher welfare than both alternatives. It is demonstrated that the model's success on the <b>nominal</b> <b>side</b> is attributable to the assumption of consumption durability and the introduction of a shock to the transaction technology. It is argued that the findings from the welfare experiments extend Poole's (1970) insights to a dynamic and stochastic environment, and that these findings suggest that the Fed has been sensibly choosing its monetary policy in response to seasonal swings and business cycle fluctuations, rather than creating exogenous disturbances to the economy...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{development}} of a control-oriented dynamics simulator for a Generation IV Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) demonstrator has been undertaken aimed at providing a very flexible and straightforward – though accurate – fast-running tool allowing to perform transient design-basis and stability analyses, and laying the foundations {{for the study of the}} system control strategy. The simulator, realized in the MATLAB/SIMULINK® environment, is composed of five essential parts: core, steam generator, primary pump, collectors, and coolant cold pool. An analytical lumped-parameter core model has been developed to treat the coupling between neutronics and thermal-hydraulics. For the steam generator a moving boundary approach has been adopted, allowing to get the physical behavior while satisfying the controller specifications, besides assuring coherence with the zero-dimensional core modeling. The complete primary loop model has been assembled by connecting the above-mentioned main subsystems through the hot and cold collectors, and by adding the remaining components blocks. Five different transients have been then simulated to analyze the whole system dynamic behavior in a control-oriented perspective: three scenarios have been initiated by acting on the secondary water side (i. e., enhancement of feedwater mass flow rate and temperature, and turbine admission valve coefficient variation), and two by perturbing the primary <b>side</b> <b>nominal</b> state (i. e., simulations of Unprotected Loss of Flow, ULOF, and of Unprotected Transient of OverPower, UTOP).

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to improve the {{measurement}} of nominal level and actual strength of China's intellectual property protection (IPP), and examine whether the increase of actual protection strength (APS) is positive or negative impact on China's provincial economic growth. Design/methodology/approach – A modified approach, based on Ginarte-Park's (GP's) and HL's approaches, is used to measure nominal level and APS of China's intellectual property rights (IPR) from 1995 to 2007. The pooled EGLS method (cross-section fixed effect) is used to estimate the effect of China's IPP and other variables on provincial economic growth. Findings – The paper proves that China's APS appears an increase with a phase. China's IPP level by GP approach is on the high side, whereas China's IPP level by HL approach is slightly on the low <b>side.</b> <b>Nominal</b> level of China's IPP is largely influenced by the legislation level, whereas APS mostly embodies the effect of implementing law level. The increase of China's APS has significant positive impact on provincial economic growth. However, at the outset of building an independent innovation country, too strong IPP is bad for the development of innovation capability, and bad for provincial economic growth. Research limitations/implications – Because the APS is unknown, it is impossible to use APS as the dependent variable to estimate the weights of the main influencing factors. The method that the paper assumes three main factors the same weights is second best choice. Thus, several different weights are supplemented to measure the distribution values of China's APS. Practical implications – China's APS quantified by a modified approach and strong evidences can be used to estimate the effect on economic growth. Policy effectiveness could be maximized at seeking the endogenous benefit balance between strengthening IPP and promoting economic development. Originality/value – The paper proposes a modified approach to measure the APS of China's IPR, and proves that the reinforcement of China's APS is beneficial to promoting provincial economic growth. However, at the outset, too strong IPP is harmful. China, Economic growth, Intellectual property, Intellectual property law, Knowledge management...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{persistence}} of relatively soft budget constraints and poor government credibility, the survival strategy of Romanian state-sector firms means eschewing profit maximization {{in the short run}} in favor of insider utility maximization. This takes the form of attempts at both reducing layoffs and minimizing real wage losses on the background of substantial adjustment in real output. Nominal adjustment (especially pricing and arrears) is favored over riskier and more costly real adjustment, since firms are risk-averse in the longer run. From an operational viewpoint, the representative firm's objective becomes that of maximizing liquidity flows subject to constraints regarding labor hoarding systemic limits to debt default and spontaneous restructuring. Empirical evidence supports the idea of an inflation-output tradeoff (in terms of variations around trends) where increases in expected inflation and/or expected gross nominal arrears have a significant negative impact on real industrial output, while unexpected inflation (and defaulted debt) exhibits positive but insignificant coefficients. The tradeoff persists even when controlling for demand-side factors. Monetary variables do not appear to cause this tradeoff, but rather seem to be mediating it. Persistence is also much more pronounced in inflation than it is in real output. Monetary policy measures then tend to have an asymmetric impact: they are likely to affect the <b>nominal</b> <b>side</b> more than the real one; monetary aggregates tend to have a sharp short-run impact compared to the stronger and longer-lasting effects induced with a lag by changes in interest rates; required reserves, because of their lesser political visibility, have for a long period been a more effective instrument of monetary policy management compared to refinancing rates, when the central bank's independence was ambiguous. Finally, {{in the context of a}} specific credit channel fueled both by commercial bank loans and by differential access to defaulted debt, short-term credit to the state sector exhibits adverse selection features compared to loans extended to private-sector firms, with the latter being in the position of net creditor due to the predominance of hard budget constraints. Firm immunity (given by size, political sensitiveness of the respective industry, importance as regional employer, etc.) to punitive interventions either on the part of government authorities or creditors seems to play a large role in the proliferation of financial indiscipline as a repeated game, with large, poorly efficient firms initiating arrears growth and other firms following either voluntarily (due to cost-of-credit differences) or involuntarily (because of a liquidity squeeze). Interestingly, arrears are not perfect substitutes for credit, while both M 2 and nongovernment credit appear to accommodate increases in gross arrears. The transmission of monetary policy via a credit channel is also interesting in the post- 1996 context of central bank deposit taking meant to sterilize excess liquidity due to relatively high capital inflows. The policy conclusions point to the limited effectiveness of monetary policy in macrostabilization of structuural reforms, privatization, financial discipline and improvements in corporate governance are absent or slow; the need for austere monetary policy in sustaining these measures; and the danger of expansionary policy aimed at growth and/or employment objectives. Institutional reforms at the central bank level (improvements in the independece of the monetary authority, stating price stability as the paramount objective of monetary policy, instituting multi-annual inflation targets in the context of a consistent macro policy mix, etc) are also examined. asymetric impact of monetary policy, inflation-output tradeoff, persistence, soft budget constraints, transition, transmission of channels...|$|E
