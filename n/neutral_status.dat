He and Lacus have spent the past two years since the end of the war {{assisting}} Reverend Malchio and Kira's adoptive mother with their orphanage. When an incident triggers another war, Coordinators try to kill Lacus; Kira pilots Freedom to defeat them. When Orb attempts to join the war as a member of the Earth Alliance, Kira and the Arcangel intervene Orb's forces to preserve the nation's <b>neutral</b> <b>status.</b> Kira suspects Gilbert Durandal, the chairman of the PLANT colonies and leader of ZAFT, to be behind Lacus' attempted murder, but his motives are questioned by Athrun who is working in ZAFT. Later, when the Archangel becomes a target of the ZAFT ship known as Minerva, Kira is defeated and the Freedom is destroyed by pilot Shinn Asuka. Lacus gives Kira an upgraded version of Freedom, , so he can continue fighting. Having obtained a weapon of mass destruction, Durandal imposes the Destiny Plan, a rule which removes freewill and dictates a person's entire life based on their genetics. Kira, the Archangel and their allies confront ZAFT's forces in space and defeat them in the final battle. Kira personally confronts Durandal and the latter is killed by one of his own subordinates.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} whether self-generated (status updates) or other-generated (wall-posts) {{information on}} Facebook influenced the impression formed {{of the target}} individual. Along with examining reliance on particular types of information, we explored the valence (posi-tive / neutral / negative) of the information, as reliance on self-generated or other-generated information may depend on whether self-presentation is perceived (i. e., presenting oneself positively / not negatively). Self-presentation may be perceived if the targets have positive/ <b>neutral</b> <b>statuses,</b> while negative statuses would indicate a lack of self-presentation. In line with previous research, participants should rely on other-generated information (wall-posts) to form an impression when participants are viewed to have self-presented (positive / neu-tral status updates), as this information {{could be viewed as}} unreliable. Forty participants rated nine Facebook profiles where statuses and wall-posts portrayed personality traits varying in valence.

40|$|When the Republic of Moldova gained {{independence}} {{after the}} dissolution of the USSR, the new country adopted a position of neutrality in world politics. Since then, Moldova's leaders have become interested in joining the European Union (EU), but there is internal debate about how best to gain admission to this important European institution. Some political leaders state that Moldova could achieve EU membership while maintaining its <b>neutral</b> strategic <b>status.</b> Other politicians, however, call for abolishing neutrality, and advocate Moldova's EU integration through NATO membership. While states which chose a status of permanent neutrality were traditionally seen as entirely aside from multinational institutional security processes, the post-Cold War EU enlargement process experienced admission of permanent neutral countries such as Austria. Additionally, over the years, the EU also accepted states that had been previously granted NATO membership, such as Latvia. This study analyses Austria's neutral and Latvia's aligned EU integration processes and tests them against Moldova's realities in order to see how Moldova can integrate into the EU in the fastest time and at the least possible cost. The thesis concludes that though the Moldovan status of permanent neutrality seems fairly irrelevant, this strategy should be maintained for the time being in order to reduce anticipated Russian objections, and thus facilitate the Republic of Moldova integration process into the European Union.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to report}} on the {{approach}} to change used {{in the development of a}} tool to assess patient status six months after stroke (the Greater Manchester Stroke Assessment Tool: GM-SAT). Design/methodology/approach – The overall approach to change is based on the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) Framework, which involves extensive stakeholder engagement before implementation. A key feature was the use of a facilitator without previous clinical experience. Findings – The active process of change involved a range of stakeholders – commissioners, patients and professionals – as well as review of published research evidence. The result of this process was the creation of the GM-SAT. Practical implications – The details of the decision processes within the tool included a range of perspectives; the process of localisation led commissioners to identify gaps in care provision as well as learning from others in terms of how services might be provided and organised. The facilitator role was key at all stages in bringing together the wide range of perspectives; the relatively <b>neutral</b> perceived <b>status</b> of the facilitator enabled resistance to change to be minimised. Social implications – The output of this project, the GM-SAT, has the potential to significantly improve patients' physical, psychological and social outcomes and optimise their quality of life. This will be explored further in future phases of work. Originality/value – A structured process of change which included multiple stakeholder involvement throughout, localisation of approaches and a dedicated independent facilitator role was effective in achieving the development of a useful tool (GM-SAT) ...|$|R
25|$|Denmark {{tried to}} regain control of Scania in the Scanian War (1675–1679) but it ended in failure. Following the Great Northern War (1700–21), Denmark managed to restore control of the parts of Schleswig and Holstein ruled by the house of Holstein-Gottorp in the 1720 Treaty of Frederiksborg and the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo, respectively. Denmark prospered greatly in the last decades of the eighteenth century due to its <b>neutral</b> <b>status</b> {{allowing}} it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars. In the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark traded with both France and the United Kingdom and joined the League of Armed Neutrality with Russia, Sweden, and Prussia. The British considered this a hostile act and attacked Copenhagen in both 1801 and 1807, in one case carrying off the Danish fleet, in the other, burning large parts of the Danish capital. This led to the so-called Danish-British Gunboat War. British control over the waterways between Denmark and Norway proved disastrous to the union's economy and in 1813 Denmark–Norway went bankrupt.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{outbreak}} of the conflict, Britain had appealed to her ally, the neutral Dutch Republic, to loan her the use of the Scots Brigade for service in America, but pro-American sentiment among the Dutch public forced them to deny the request. Consequently, the British attempted to invoke several treaties for outright Dutch military support, but the Republic still refused. Moreover, American troops were being supplied with ordnance by Dutch merchants via their West Indies colonies. French supplies bound for America had also passed through Dutch ports. The Republic maintained free trade with France following France's declaration of war on Britain, citing a prior concession by Britain on this issue. Britain responded by confiscating Dutch shipping, and even firing upon it. Consequently, the Republic joined the First League of Armed Neutrality to enforce their <b>neutral</b> <b>status.</b> The Republic had also given sanctuary to American privateers and had drafted a treaty of commerce with the Americans. Britain argued that these actions contravened the Republic's neutral stance and declared war in December 1780.|$|E

40|$|N-acetylcysteine (NAC), {{a strong}} antioxidant, has antigenotoxic and anticarcinogenic {{properties}} currently being investigated in clinical trials. NAC detoxifies free radicals (e. g., the hydroxyl radical, ·OH) that cause DNA changes implicated in disease (e. g., cancer). The ·OH reacts with purines to form mutagenic 8 -hydroxypurine (8 -OH) and putatively nonmutagenic formamidopyrimidine (Fapy) lesions. Fapy lesions inhibit DNA synthesis likely modulating the mutagenic {{potential of the}} 8 -OH lesions, which {{would suggest that the}} ratio of these oxidized bases is biologically important. However, little is known about how NAC modifies oxidized DNA structure or how such modifications may affect cellular processes, such as replication and transcription. By using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, we found that dietary NAC (5 % in the diet for 14 days) affected ·OH-induced structural changes in DNA of the hind leg of the BALB/c mouse. For example, mutagenic 8 -hydroxyguanine (8 -OH-Gua) was reduced ≈ 50 % (P = 0. 02) in mice fed NAC compared with controls. NAC reduced the log 10 (8 -OH-Gua/FapyGua) ratio from 0. 58 ± 0. 15 to essentially zero, a virtually <b>neutral</b> redox <b>status.</b> DNA from control mice had a remarkably high variance compared with mice fed NAC. Moreover, the DNA from treated and control mice was distinct with respect to base structure and vertical base-stacking interactions. The findings showing that NAC lowered the concentration of 8 -OH-Gua, the log ratio, and the variance (previously associated with neoplastic changes) suggest that NAC reduces the mutagenic potential of oxidized DNA. These benefits could be offset by the other structural changes found after NAC exposure, which may affect the fidelity of DNA synthesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{presents}} a systematic {{review of the}} literature around expressing gratitude and Facebook use and the impact of these behaviours on the well-being of young people. Studies were included if they evaluated the effects of Facebook use, keeping a gratitude log or sharing gratitude (online or otherwise) on measures of well-being. The review searched three electronic databases for peer-reviewed journal articles from 1995 onwards. No reports were found concerning the specific intervention of sharing of gratitude on Facebook. A total of seven Facebook interventions and 14 gratitude interventions were included. The analysis of these 21 interventions showed that overall, Facebook usage appears to {{have a negative impact on}} participants’ well-being whilst gratitude interventions appear to have a positive impact on well-being. Based on these findings it is concluded that now is a good time to begin a new program of research exploring effect of sharing gratitude on Facebook. The empirical paper examined the effectiveness of a Facebook based gratitude intervention to promote well-being in young people aged 16 - 18 (N = 70). Participants completed online questionnaire measures pre and post intervention as well as at a six-week follow up. Participants posted grateful or <b>neutral</b> learning <b>status</b> update to Facebook daily for ten consecutive college days. ANOVAs revealed no significant effect of condition. Moderation analysis found that the intervention has a positive impact on well-being but only for individuals who perceived peer reactions to be positive. This tentatively suggests that simply expressing gratefulness is not enough to boost well-being, expressed gratitude needs to be positively acknowledged by others. The findings extend the evidence base in the fields of post- 16 well-being, Facebook use and gratitude sharing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe crystal {{structure}} of a novel sulfonyl-pyridazinone inhibitor in complex with aldose reductase, the first enzyme of the polyol pathway, has been determined to 1. 43 angstroms and 0. 95 angstroms resolution. The ternary complex of inhibitor, cofactor and enzyme has been obtained by soaking of preformed crystals. Supposedly due to low solubility in the crystallisation buffer, in both structures the inhibitor shows reduced occupancy of 74 % and 46 % population, respectively. The pyridazinone head group of the inhibitor occupies the catalytic site, whereas the chloro-benzofuran moiety penetrates into the opened specificity pocket. The high-resolution structure provides some evidence that the pyridazinone group binds in a negatively charged deprotonated state, whereas the neighbouring His 110 residue most likely adopts a <b>neutral</b> uncharged <b>status.</b> Since the latter structure is populated by the ligand to only 46 %, a second conformation of the C-terminal ligand-binding region can be detected. This conformation corresponds to the closed state of the specificity pocket when no or only small ligands are bound to aldose reductase. The two conformational states are in good agreement with frames observed along a molecular dynamics trajectory describing the transition from closed to open situation. Accordingly, both geometries, superimposed in the averaged {{crystal structure}}, correspond to snapshots of the ligand-bound and the unbound state. Isothermal titration calorimetry {{has been applied to}} determine the binding constants of the investigated pyridazinone in comparison to the hydantoin sorbinil and the carboxylate-type inhibitors IDD 594 and tolrestat. The pyridazinone exhibits a binding affinity similar to those of tolrestat and sorbinil, and shows slightly reduced affinity compared to IDD 594. These studies elucidating the binding mode and providing information about protonation states of protein side-chains involved in binding of this novel class of inhibitors establish the platform for further structure-based drug design...|$|R

40|$|The {{illegal drugs}} market {{is one of}} the main issues in the {{political}} agenda in Colombia. Literature has focused on legalization in consumption (demand) but studies about legalization of production (supply) are scarce. Taking into account that Colombia is a country leading in drugs production but not drugs consumption in the world, it is relevant to understand illegal drugs supply. The elements that influence decisions about drugs production and the investor behavior under certain incentives have received few attention. In order to analyze the behavioral structure of investment decisions, this paper conducts a laboratory experiment. The aim is to analyze the effect of three different factors influencing the individual decision to invest when a business is related to (i) a criminal activity (illegal), (ii) drugs, or (iii) a negative social effect (negative externality) using a between subjects design. The experiment has two parts. Part I is a replication of the “Ten Paired Lottery-Choice Decisions” by Holt and Laury (2002) to measure individual's risk aversion level. Part II keeps the same structure but shows a frame that varies three elements along treatments: type of business (drugs-related or <b>neutral),</b> legal <b>status</b> (illegal or legal) and the presence of a negative externality. The experiment was applied on 141 undergraduate students of the Universidad del Rosario. Results show a robust gender effect meaning that women are more risk averse than men and they are more prone to increase their risk aversion level in Part II while they revealed more conservative attitudes in front of drugs policies in the post experiment survey. No evidence was found of any effects of illegality and the negative externality on investment decisions. Descriptive comparisons suggest an unwillingness to invest in a drugs-related business. These results suggest that neither illegality nor the existence of a negative externality are efficient elements to discourage investment...|$|R

40|$|The Dark Mirror: Psychiatry and Film Noir probes the {{meanings}} behind {{the depiction of}} psychiatry and psychological illness in film noir, and how these depictions contribute to an overall understanding about the noir cycle itself. In this study, Marlisa Santos examines {{the role that the}} popularization of psychoanalysis in the 1940 s and 1950 s, beginning with the use of psychoanalytic techniques to treat World War II soldiers, had on writers and filmmakers of noir. This popularization had a lasting effect on American culture, especially as ideas such as introspection and a morally <b>neutral</b> universe became <b>status</b> quo, and thereby became reflected in the noir series. The films analyzed in this study reveal a distillation of such ideas, a bringing to the surface concerns and fears regarding the contradictory, yet thrilling nature of psychoanalysis: the ability of a 2 ̆ 7 science of the mind 2 ̆ 7 to eliminate the mysteries of the human psyche and the simultaneous nature of this science to expose the fundamental unknowability of the human psyche. Indeed, Santos argues that noir itself might not have existed without the introduction of psychoanalysis into American culture. [URL]...|$|R
