40|$|Measurement {{of phase}} noise {{affecting}} oscillators or clocks {{is a fundamental}} practice whenever the need of a reliable time base is of primary concern. In spite {{of the number of}} methods or techniques either available in the literature or implemented as personalities in general-purpose equipment, very accurate measurement results can be gained only through expensive, dedicated instruments. To offer a cost-effective alternative, the authors have already realized a DSP-based phase <b>noise</b> <b>meter,</b> capable of assuring good performance and real-time operation. The meter, however, suffers from a reduced frequency range (about 250 kHz), and needs an external time base for input signal digitization. To overcome these drawbacks, the authors propose the use of bandpass sampling strategies to enlarge the frequency range, and of an internal time base to make standalone operation much more feasible. After some remarks on the previous version of the meter, key features of the adopted time base and proposed sampling strategies are described in detail. Results of experimental tests, carried out on sinusoidal signals provided both by function and arbitrary waveform generators, are presented and discussed; evidence of the meter’s reliability and efficacy is finally given...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe major {{objective}} of this research study {{was to develop a}} methodology to evaluate tyre/road noise of the various road types and sections in Bangalore. The scope of the effort included field noise measurements of the 17 conventional asphalt concrete (AC), four Portland cement concrete (PCC), and two plastic modified asphalt concrete (PMAC) in Bangalore city covering about 24 km of roadway stretches at varying traffic speeds. Field noise measurements were performed using a <b>noise</b> <b>meter</b> mounted underneath a trailer developed in this study and attached to the parent vehicle. Overall, PMAC sections produced the highest noise levels than the PCC followed by the conventional AC sections; PMAC mix type had an average difference of about 6 – 8 decibels (dB(A)) compared with the AC mix, and 1 – 2 dB(A) in comparison with the PCC mix types. It is noteworthy that although many traffic noise studies have been conducted in India, the contribution of tyre/road noise to the overall noise has not been developed and/or established till date.

40|$|Numerous {{machines}} used {{to execute}} {{public works projects}} produce noise, {{and in the past}} noise measurements were performed assuming project noise is produced by a single sound source. But to perform practical noise prediction, the quantity of noise from each machine must be obtained. The authors analyzed simulated noise in semi-anechoic room and outdoor construction machinery noise with a straight microphone array installed horizontally to calculate the quantities of noise produced by individual sound sources. Simulated noise in semi-anechoic room had been analyzed with target accuracy. But, with the outdoor moving sound sources, the total of the analysis values was reduced to between 2. 4 and 4 dB. Approximately- 1 dB is caused by applying the delay and sum, approximately- 1 dB is caused by installing a band pass filter, and the remaining- 0. 4 to- 2 dB is caused mainly by motion of the sound sources.
