5|$|The small Asian {{mongoose}} (Herpestus javanicus) {{was introduced}} to Hawaii {{in order to control}} the rat population. However the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; so it preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the rats, and <b>now</b> <b>both</b> rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations existed at the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.|$|E
5|$|Between 1797 and 1809 the First French Empire {{gradually}} {{occupied the}} entire eastern Adriatic coastline and {{a substantial part}} of its hinterland, ending the Venetian and the Ragusan republics, establishing the Illyrian Provinces. In response the Royal Navy started the blockade of the Adriatic Sea leading to the Battle of Vis in 1811. The Illyrian Provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813, and absorbed by the Austrian Empire following the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This led to formation of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and restoration of the Croatian Littoral to the Kingdom of Croatia, <b>now</b> <b>both</b> under the same crown.|$|E

5|$|In November 2008, {{during an}} episode of Hollyoaks {{spin-off}} Hollyoaks Later, Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) and Zoe Carpenter (Zoë Lister) had a sexual encounter. Up to <b>now</b> <b>both</b> characters had previously been portrayed as heterosexual {{and this was the}} start of Sarah's on-going sexuality crisis. The character of Lydia Hart was created as the new love interest for the sexually confused already established character, Sarah. When the character first appeared on-screen she was revealed to have a younger sister, Persephone Hart (Elizabeth Hadley), who was attending the dance classes taught by Sarah. Little is known about the rest of Lydia's family, although the character did stay with her mother frequently off-screen. The character was also given links to Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki) who arrived in Hollyoaks in June 2009. It was soon revealed that Lydia was Charlotte's ex-girlfriend.|$|E
5|$|The French Army of Switzerland and the Army of the Danube, <b>now</b> <b>both</b> {{under the}} command of André Masséna, sought to prevent this merger. Masséna sent Michel Ney and a small mixed cavalry and {{infantry}} force from Zürich to stop Hotze's force at Winterthur. Despite a sharp contest, the Austrians succeeded in pushing the French out of the Winterthur highlands, although both sides took high casualties. Once the union of the Habsburg armies took place in early June, Archduke Charles attacked French positions at Zürich and forced the French to withdraw beyond the Limmat.|$|E
5|$|Having {{begun to}} push back the feeble French forces from Marmont's VI's Corps the day before, Blücher {{occupied}} Champaubert early on 14 February, sending his vanguard forward, {{as far as the}} village of Fromentières and then Vauchamps. Marmont, commanding only the Lagrange division and 800 men from the Ricard division, had cautiously pulled his men back towards Montmirail, where he began to receive reinforcements. Towards 9 o'clock in the morning, Blücher set Zieten's brigade and some cavalry in motion from Vauchamps towards Montmirail. To their surprise, Marmont's men didn't give ground this time and vigorously counterattacked, pushing Zieten's advance guard back into the village of Vauchamps. The accompanying Prussian cavalry was dispersed by a violent French cannonade. With <b>now</b> <b>both</b> brigades of Ricard's division available, Marmont launched these men against the Prussian position at Vauchamps, with the 1st brigade on his right, advancing under the cover of the Beaumont forest, south of the Montmirail-Vauchamps road and the 2nd brigade on his left, north of the road, advancing frontally towards the position. Marmont also had with him his own escort cavalry squadron and four élite Imperial Guard duty squadrons from the Emperor's own escort, under general Lion. Marmont's leftmost brigade entered Vauchamps, but, with the village heavily invested with Zieten's Prussian defenders, the Frenchmen were soon repulsed, with the Prussians in pursuit. Marshal Marmont then launched his five squadrons to the rescue and the cavalry promptly forced the Prussians back to the village, with one of their battalions taken prisoner, after taking refuge in an isolated farm.|$|E

5|$|The royal and baronial parties <b>now</b> <b>both</b> began {{preparations}} for war. In March, Gaveston settled at Scarborough, {{and began to}} fortify the castle. Around the same time, he was pronounced excommunicate by Archbishop Winchelsey at St Paul's. At the same meeting the barons – {{under the leadership of}} Lancaster – divided up the realm to oppose the King. Pembroke and Warenne were given the responsibility of capturing Gaveston. On 4 May, the King and Gaveston were at Newcastle, and barely escaped a force led by Lancaster, Henry Percy and Robert Clifford. Gaveston then returned to Scarborough, while the King left for York. Scarborough was soon besieged by Pembroke, Warenne, Percy and Clifford, and on 19 May Gaveston surrendered to the besiegers. The terms of the surrender were that Pembroke, Warenne and Percy would take Gaveston to York, where the barons would negotiate with the king. If an agreement could not be reached by 1 August, Gaveston would be allowed to return to Scarborough. The three swore an oath to guarantee his safety. After an initial meeting with the King in York, Gaveston was left in the custody of Pembroke, who escorted him south for safekeeping.|$|E
