5|$|Five years later, Woodruff disguises {{himself with}} a beard and monocle and assumes a <b>new</b> <b>identity</b> {{in an attempt to}} court Allen. She is able to {{recognize}} him as Woodruff because of his fear of fire tongs. Because she is friends with the governor, she is able to arrange her husband's release from prison.

At trial, he declares that the prohibition against double jeopardy prevents his prosecution for the murder; he is set free to live happily with his wife.|$|E
5|$|It Is the Law is a 1924 American silent mystery film {{directed}} by J. Gordon Edwards and starring Arthur Hohl, Herbert Hayes, and Mona Palma. It {{is a film}} adaptation of the eponymous 1922 Broadway play by Elmer Rice, itself based on a novel by Hayden Talbot. The film depicts the story of Ruth Allen (Palma), who marries Justin Victor (Heyes) over competing suitor Albert Woodruff (Hohl). Seeking revenge for this slight, Woodruff fakes his death by killing a drifter who resembles him, and frames Victor for the murder. When Woodruff returns to court Allen under a <b>new</b> <b>identity,</b> she sees through his disguise. Once Victor is freed from prison, he kills Woodruff, and goes free because a conviction would constitute double jeopardy.|$|E

Fortier agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols {{in exchange for a}} reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998 to twelveyears in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack.

Shuu then recalls that Nageki's only relative—his adoptive brother—was, like Kazuaki, a quail. The {{terrorist}} incident occurred at Kazuaki and Nageki's orphanage and left them as the only survivors; witnessing Nageki's subsequent suicide drove Kazuaki insane, leading him to fake his own death, assume a <b>new</b> <b>identity,</b> and join the school's faculty to take revenge against Shuu, the head of Operation Hatoful.

Chatto himself was in Berlin until 1932 as the general secretary of the League Against Imperialism and was able to convince Jawaharlal Nehru to affiliate the Indian National Congress with the league in 1927. He later fled Nazi Germany for the Soviet Union but disappeared in 1937 under Joseph Stalin's Great Purge.|$|E

5|$|When in 2002 {{another life}} {{sentence}} prisoner challenged the Home Secretary's power to set minimum terms, Hindley {{and hundreds of}} others, whose tariffs had been increased by politicians, looked likely {{to be released from}} prison. Hindley's release seemed imminent and plans were made by supporters for her to be given a <b>new</b> <b>identity.</b> Home Secretary David Blunkett ordered Greater Manchester Police to find new charges against her, to prevent her release from prison. The investigation was headed by Superintendent Tony Brett, and initially looked at charging Hindley with the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, but the advice given by government lawyers was that because of the DPP's decision taken 15 years earlier, a new trial would probably be considered an abuse of process.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a <b>new</b> <b>identity</b> and is {{laundering}} the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her {{the chance to get}} revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers {{to go out on a}} date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella inadvertently gives away her identity to Steve by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her. Steve is shocked they survived but taunts them that he has the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|Having {{staged a}} coup of New York after {{spreading}} his resources by exploiting Otto's reliance on technology, the Goblin King directly confronts Otto, angry {{that he was}} cheated out {{of the opportunity to}} defeat his enemy, but offering Otto the chance to join him. Otto rejects the offer, but when he finds that he cannot win against the Goblin King's resources, having had his new allies abandon him, and with his faith in his own abilities gone, he sacrifices himself to restore the original Spider-Man's mind. When Spider-Man arrives for the final confrontation, the Goblin King quickly realizes that the original personality is back in control when Spider-Man responds to his nemesis' taunts with his own wisecracks. In the duel that follows, Spider-Man unmasks Goblin King, learning that he has undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, acting as the CEO of Alchemax and intending to re-establish himself as businessman Mason Banks, now that Norman Osborn has become too publicly known as a supervillain. Spider-Man defeats and strips the villain of his powers with a serum devised by Otto, but Norman manages to escape through the discreet aid of Liz Allan. In hiding once again, he reflects that the various heroes will be unprepared for him when he returns with his <b>new</b> <b>identity</b> and approach as a businessman, seemingly no longer afflicted by the mental illness associated with the Green Goblin formula.|$|E

However, their own personal belongings have been gone through and the TARDIS has sunk into acid-corroded ground. The Doctor explains that they have likely been unconscious {{for more than an hour}} and the Gangers have gained sentience. They soon discover that two of the Gangers are amongst them, posing as Cleaves and Jennifer (Sarah Smart), when the two give themselves away by turning pale-white. Jennifer also exhibits the ability to contort and stretch her body well beyond human limits. The Jennifer Ganger struggles with her <b>new</b> <b>identity</b> and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an emotional attachment to her. The Cleaves Ganger works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans, as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers. The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills one of the Gangers with a high-powered electrical charge. The Gangers plan an attack, and the Doctor accuses Cleaves of killing a living being which Cleaves refuses to acknowledge. The Ganger Jennifer hunts her human counterpart to kill her. The Doctor determines that in a monastery, the safest place to be is the chapel, and directs everyone there. The Gangers, in acid-protection suits, bear down on the chapel. Rory responds to the sound of Jennifer screaming by deliberately separating from the group, against Amy's wishes. In the chapel, Amy and the Doctor discover a Ganger version of the Doctor.|$|E
