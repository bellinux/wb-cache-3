50|$|The Serra do <b>Divisor</b> <b>National</b> Park (Parque Nacional da Serra do Divisor) is a 8463 km2 {{national}} {{park on the}} westernmost point of Brazil, {{in the state of}} Acre, near the Peruvian border. It also has the highest point in that state, reaching 609 meters above sea level. It has been nominated by the Brazilian government as a Tentative World Heritage Site since 1998.|$|R
50|$|Conservation {{units in}} the {{proposal}} included the Serra do <b>Divisor</b> <b>National</b> Park, Alto Tarauacá Extractive Reserve, Alto Juruá Extractive Reserve, Macauã National Forest, Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, Jaci Paraná Extractive Reserve, Bom Futuro National Forest, Pacaás Novos National Park, Guaporé Biological Reserve and Corumbiara State Park.As of 2010 the proposed corridor would contain 30 indigenous territories and 19 conservation units in Acre {{along the border with}} Peru, covering 45.66% of the state of Acre.|$|R
40|$|The Amazonian toadheaded pitviper Bothrocophias hyoprora (Amaral, 1935) {{is known}} from Brazil (states of Amazonas and Rondônia), Colombia, eastern Equador, Peru, and Bolivia. We report the first record {{of this species}} {{from the state of}} Acre (Brazil) in the Serra do <b>Divisor</b> <b>National</b> Park. This record extends the species {{distribution}} in 540 km to the southwest of Tabatinga, state of Amazonas, which was the nearest record of this species in Brazilian Amazon...|$|R
50|$|The Serra do <b>Divisor</b> <b>National</b> Park {{was created}} by decree 97.839 on 16 June 1989 to protect and {{preserve}} sample of ecosystems, ensure preservation of its natural resources, and allow controlled use by the public, education and scientific research.The consultative council was created on 5 July 2002.The management plan was approved on 24 December 2002.In 2013, Rainforest Trust launched a campaign to fund the establishment of another national park {{in the same area}} on the Peruvian side of the border.The conservation unit is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} bounded by the {{international}} border with Peru to the south.It adjoins the Serra do <b>Divisor</b> <b>National</b> Park on the northwest, and the Riozinho da Liberdade and Alto Tarauacá extractive reserves on the northeast.It also adjoins the Arara do Rio Amônia and Kampa do Rio Amônea indigenous territories on {{the west and the}} Jaminawa/Arara do Rio Bagé, Kaxinawa do Baixo Jordão, Kaxinawa do Rio Jordão and Kaxinawa/Ashaninka do Rio Breu indigenous territories to the east.The reserve would be included in the proposed Western Amazon Ecological Corridor.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974, Campbell was a botanical {{explorer}} at the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia (INPA) in Manaus, Brazil, {{from where}} he staged expeditions to study the ethnobotany of the Jamamaji and Paumari Native Americans. Campbell joined the scientific staff of the New York Botanical Garden from 1984-1990, conducting floristic inventories throughout the Brazilian Amazon basin {{as part of the}} Projeto Flora Amazônica program; destinations included O Deserto on the Rio Xingu (Pará), the Rio Falsino (Amapá), [...] (Roraima), the Rio Moa and Serra do <b>Divisor</b> <b>National</b> Park (Acre).|$|R
50|$|The Serra do <b>Divisor</b> <b>National</b> Park {{is divided}} between the {{municipalities}} of Rodrigues Alves (13.45%), Porto Walter (26.99%), Marechal Thaumaturgo (4.73%), Mâncio Lima (31.71%) and Cruzeiro do Sul (23.12%) {{in the state of}} Acre.It has an area of 846633 ha.The park is bounded to the west by the border with Peru, which runs along the Serra Divisor mountain range.It adjoins the Alto Juruá Extractive Reserve along its southeast border.The Juruá River defines the eastern boundary of the southern section of the park.The Azul River defines the eastern boundary of the northern section.The conservation unit would be included in the proposed Western Amazon Ecological Corridor.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{attempted}} to answer whether there is correspondence between aquatic macroinvertebrate communities and the typological classification of white and clean-water streams in western Amazonia lowlands. We worked within two distinct hydrographic basins: Moa River catchment (clear-water streams) and Azul River catchment (white-water streams) in Serra do <b>Divisor</b> <b>National</b> Park, Acre State, Brazil, sampling 10 streams in each basin. A total of 2, 952 individuals were collected, distributed among 134 taxa. Our results show that macroinvertebrate communities, at genus as well as family level, are in concordance to a priori classifications that distinguish between white and clear water streams. The main implication of our results for biomonitoring is that biotic variation between white and clear streams can be partitioned regionally, which would improve the bioassessment accuracy of the Amazonian streams...|$|R
2500|$|Manú National Park, a World Heritage Site, protects [...] of {{pristine}} lowland {{forest in}} southern Peru, {{a large part}} of which falls into this ecoregion. The nearby Tambopata-Candamo reserve protects seven major forest types. This reserve offers refuge to game species that have been over-hunted in other areas such as tapirs, spider monkeys, jaguars, capybaras, white-lipped peccaries, monkeys, caimans and river turtles. The Manuripi-Heath Amazonian Wildlife National Reserve is located in the southernmost area of this region in Bolivia covering [...] of dense tropical forest. Several extractive reserves, the largest being Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve and Alto Juruá Extractive Reserve, are actively managed in Brazil. Other protected areas include national parks (Serra do <b>Divisor</b> <b>National</b> Park, Madidi National Park, Isoboro Secure National Park, Bahuaja-Sonene National Park), national forests, Rio Acre Ecological Station, Antimari State Forest, Apurimac Reserve Zone, among others. Most protected areas suffer from insufficient administration and patrol.|$|R
