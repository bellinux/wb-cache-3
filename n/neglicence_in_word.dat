50|$|Although Obando and Obaldía both {{belonged to}} the newly created Liberal party, they belonged to {{different}} ideological camps, Obando was of the Draconian faction (pragmatist but defenders of the death penalty), and Obaldía was of the Golgothian faction (radical liberal reformers) this brought them into conflict from the start as the Golgothians had opposed Obando's nomination in the first place. In April 1854, Golgothians in congress moved {{to reduce the size}} and influence of the armed forces, thus prvoking a coup by General José María Melo y Ortiz, commander of the Bogotá garrison. General Melo hoped that Obando would welcome the uprise and move to suspend Congress, but when President Obando refused, Melo assumed the presidency himself establishing a dictatorship and imprisoning Obando. Vice President Obaldía managed to escape by taking refuge in the US Legation in Bogotá headed by James S. Green, the United States Chargé d'Affaire to New Granada. Obaldía {{and the rest of the}} Melo opposition reconvened in Ibagué where they headed the government-in-exile and the military campaign to take Melo from power. On 22 September, Congress convened in Ibagué impeached President Obando for irresponsible <b>neglicence</b> <b>in</b> not preventing the coup and formally removed from office. On 5 August Vice President Obaldía, who had testified against Obando in his trial before Congress, was left in charge of the Executive Power as Acting President of the Government acting in rebellion against the Dictatorship of Melo. On 4 December the constitutional forces marched into Bogotá, deposed Melo and left Vice President Obaldía as Acting President of the constitutional government now in power. On 1 April 1855 Obaldía's term came to an end and Congress elected Conservative Congressman Manuel María Mallarino Ibargüen to succeede Obaldía as Vice President and to finish Obando's term as Acting President.|$|R

40|$|Abstract : This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to provide support}} for the prediction that familiarity of <b>words</b> <b>in</b> contexts affects the degree of hyper/hypo-articulation of vowels <b>in</b> these <b>words.</b> Results from the present analysis show that the repetition of <b>words</b> <b>in</b> a story causes hypoarticulation of vowels <b>in</b> these <b>words.</b> Among the eight types of vowels whose F 1 and F 2 values are measured, two types of vowels <b>in</b> <b>words</b> that come {{for the second time}} in a context show hypoarticulation to a much higher degree than those <b>in</b> <b>words</b> that come for the first time. One type of vowel <b>in</b> the <b>words</b> that come for the second time shows more partial hypoarticulation than that <b>in</b> the <b>words</b> that come for the first time. Three types of vowels show almost the same F 1 and F 2 values in both cases. A vowel space with four corner vowels <b>in</b> the <b>words</b> that come for the second time is smaller than that <b>in</b> <b>words</b> that come for the first time, which also indicates a tendency toward hypoarticulation for vowels <b>in</b> <b>words</b> repeated after their first introduction. 　　Keywords: formant, hypoarticulation, repetition, space, vowe...|$|R
40|$|Structural regularities in {{language}} {{have often been}} attributed to symbolic or statistical general purpose computations, whereas perceptual factors influencing such generalizations have received less interest. Here, we use phonotactic-like constraints {{as a case study}} to ask whether the structural properties of specific perceptual and memory mechanisms may facilitate the acquisition of grammatical-like regular-ities. Participants learned that the consonants C 1 and C 2 had to come from distinct sets <b>in</b> <b>words</b> of the form C 1 VccVC 2 (where the critical consonants were <b>in</b> <b>word</b> edges) but not <b>in</b> <b>words</b> of the form cVC 1 C 2 Vc (where the critical consonants were <b>in</b> <b>word</b> middles). Control conditions ruled out attentional or psychophysical difficulties <b>in</b> <b>word</b> middles. Participants did, however, learn such regularities <b>in</b> <b>word</b> middles when natural consonant classes were used instead of arbitrary consonant sets. We conclude that positional generalizations may be learned preferentially using edge-based positional codes, but that participants can also use other mechanisms when other linguistic cues are given...|$|R
