For radiometric correction of satellite images there two main methods are useful, absolute radiometric normalization and relative radiometric normalization. Relative radiometric correction has number of applications in weather and climate studies, crop studies, detection and removal of cloud, change detection and so on. The image distortion due to cloud cover is a classical problem of remote sensing imagery. Especially, for <b>non-stationary</b> <b>satellite,</b> it is commonly found in the earth resource observation application. Removing cloud cover from satellite imagery is very useful for assisting image interpretation. Hence cloud detection and removal is very vital in processing of satellite imagery. For detection and removal of cloud relative radiometric normalization using no change set (NC) technique is proposed here in spatial domain {{as well as in}} frequency domain. The cloudy image is radiometrically normalized by using reference image of same area, acquired at different date. The visual appearance results, statistical results and histogram results are discussed...|$|E

The major concern {{of this paper is to}} investigate the nonstationary character of multi-temporal time series. To overcome this problem, we propose an adaptive multiplicative decomposition of <b>non-stationary</b> multi-temporal <b>satellite</b> image, which allows to decompose the series into three components: trend, seasonal and random, to properly model the evolution of land cover. We carried several experiments to validate our approach based on Landsat images covering the region of "Tres Cantos-Madrid" in Spain. The obtained results show the effectiveness of our proposed method comparing to some conventional methods...|$|R

This {{is not only a}} technical problem because for example for the GRAIL-mission all the observables for the two radio links at the K and Ka- bands (26 GHz and 32 GHz) for intersatellite ranging and also the navigation observables for the S- and X- bands (2 GHz and 8 GHz) should be formulated within the General Relativity Theory (GRT). The same approach should be applied to the inter- satellite GPS-communications (in perspective also between the GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite constellations). In this paper a theoretical approach has been developed for ISC between two satellites moving on (one-plane) elliptical orbits based on the introduction of two gravity null cones with origins at the emitting-signal and receiving-signal satellites. The two null cones account for the variable distance between the satellites and their uncorrelated motion. The most important consequence of the theory is the obtained condition for ISC. This theory places also a restriction on the ellipticity e of the orbit (e less or equal than 0. 816496580927726). For the typical GPS orbital parameters the condition for ISC gives a value E = 45. 00251 [deg] for the eccentric anomaly angle, which is surprisingly close to the value for the true anomaly angle f = 45. 54143 [deg] and also to the angle of disposition of the satellites in the GLONASS satellite constellation (the Russian analogue of the American GPS) - 8 satellites within one and the same plane equally spaced at 45 deg. The paper is the first step towards constructing a new and consistent relativistic physical theory of ISC between moving (<b>non-stationary)</b> <b>satellites.</b> Comment: 29 pages, no figures,revtex-style, to be subm. to Phys.

This research led to important conclusions as regards {{the nature of the}} stellar energy sources. Ambartsumian's proposed principally new concept of p-star matter. As opposite to the classical hypotheses suggesting that the stars have been formed as a result of condensation of diffuse matter, the new hypothesis postulated the existence of massive bodies, the [...] "proto-stars."

40|$|A {{profound}} {{knowledge of}} mobile radio channels {{is required for}} the development, evaluation, and also assessment at practical conditions of present and future mobile radio communication systems. The modelling, analysis, and simulation of mobile radio channels are important sub area since the initiation of mobile communications. In addition to that knowledge of channel behaviour in mobile radio communication is extensively recommended for the study of transmitter/receiver performances. Our intention in this master's thesis is to develop various kinds of mobile fading channel simulators using MATLAB and embed them into MATLB software as a toolbox. Implemented channel simulators were combined into a user-friendly Matlab toolbox from which users can easily select well-known channel models to test and to study the performance of mobile communication systems. The help file was developed based on HTML. It gives better support for the new users to work on the developed channel simulators, run the test procedures as well as parameter computation. The help file consistent with other supplementary programs like computation of PDF and CDF for different distributions, Rice simulation model, extended Suzuki process type I and II simulator etc. In addition to that each program consists with guidelines embedded with the source code. The help file web interfaces are listed in Appendix- 1. The toolbox can be integrated into the new release of Matlab software. The toolbox contains channel simulators for simulating <b>non-stationary</b> land mobile <b>satellite</b> channel, spatial shadowing processes, MIMO channels, multiple uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, mobile to mobile channel, frequency hopping channels etc. We developed set of test procedures, such as the autocorrelation function ACF, average duration of fades ADF, the probability density function PDF, and the level-crossing rate LCR etc., in order to test and to confirm the correctness of the implemented channel simulators. Proposed new algorithms to compute the model parameters of the channel simulators were also implemented in the toolbox to enable the parameterization of the channel simulators under specific propagation conditions. Finally, “how can a channel simulator be tested?” have been address in the thesis as a research question. It was based on the comparison of simulation results with the measured model or the reference model under different scenarios. In addition to that selection of the simulation time duration, sampling rate and size of the samples were considered.
