50|$|A single-element {{camera lens}} is {{as long as}} its focal length; for example, 500 mm-focal-length lens {{requires}} 500 mm from the lens to the image plane. A telephoto lens is made physically shorter than its <b>nominal</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> by pairing a front positive imaging cell with a rear magnifying negative cell. The powerful front group over-refracts the image, the rear restores the focal plane, thereby greatly shortening the back-focus length. Originally, accessory negative cells were sold to attach {{to the rear of}} a regular lens. The Barlow lens, a negative achromat magnifier invented by Peter Barlow in 1833, is still sold to increase the eyepiece magnification of amateur telescopes. The teleconverter is the modern photographic equivalent.|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} practical constraint currently {{applying to}} the adoption of consumer-grade digital cameras for photogrammetric measurement is the requirement to record images at fixed zoom and focus settings. This is a consequence of the variation of camera calibration parameters, especially principal distance and lens distortion, with changing zoom and focus. This paper describes a zoomdependent calibration model, in which the image coordinate correction equations for departures from collinearity are expressed {{as a function of the}} <b>nominal</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> written to the EXIF header of the images. Such a calibration approach frees the user from the constraint of recording images with both fixed focus and zoom. The newly developed zoom-dependent calibration approach is reviewed and the results of its application to the calibration of a number of off-the-shelf cameras are presented. The benefits of the approach for medium-accuracy close-range photogrammetry applications across fields as diverse as traffic accident reconstruction and heritage recording are then highlighted...|$|E
40|$|The {{focal length}} of a {{telescope}} is an important parameter in determining the angular pixel size. This parameter {{is used for the}} purpose of determining the relative coordinates (angular separation and positional angle) of double and multiple stars, and the precise coordinates of extragalactic radio sources (ERS) that are visible at optical wavelengths. At the Astronomical Station Vidojevica we have collected observations of these objects using two CCD cameras, Apogee Alta U 42 and SBIG ST- 10 ME, attached to the 60 cm telescope. Its <b>nominal</b> <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> is 600 cm as given by the manufacturer. To determine the telescope focal length more precisely for both attached detectors, we used angular-separation measurements from CCD images taken at Astronomical Station Vidojevica. The obtained focal lengths are: F 42 = (5989 ± 7) mm using the CCD camera Apogee Alta U 42 attached to the telescope, and F 10 = (5972 ± 4) mm with the CCD camera SBIG ST- 10 ME attached to the telescope...|$|E
40|$|An {{accurate}} and simple technique {{for determining the}} <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> of a lens is presented. It consists of measuring {{the period of the}} fringes produced by a diffraction grating at the near field when it is illuminated with a beam focused by the unknown lens. In paraxial approximation, the period of the fringes varies linearly with the distance. After some calculations, a simple extrapolation of data is performed to obtain the locations of the principal plane and the focal plane of the lens. Thus, the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> is obtained as the distance between the two mentioned planes. The accuracy of the method is limited by the collimation degree of the incident beam and by the algorithm used to obtain the period of the fringes. We have checked the technique with two commercial lenses, one convergent and one divergent, with <b>nominal</b> <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> (+ 100 ± 1) mm and (− 100 ± 1) mm respectively. We have experimentally obtained the <b>focal</b> <b>lengths</b> resulting into the interval given by the manufacturer but with an uncertainty of 0. 1 %, one order of magnitude lesser than the uncertainty given by the manufacturer...|$|R

40|$|The Magellan Adaptive Optics {{system will}} achieve first light in November of 2012. This AO system {{contains}} several subsystems including the 585 -actuator concave adaptive secondary mirror, the Calibration Return Optic (CRO) alignment and calibration system, the CLIO 1 - 5 μm IR science camera, the movable guider camera and active optics assembly, and the W-Unit, which contains both the Pyramid Wavefront Sensor (PWFS) and the VisAO visible science camera. In this dissertation, we present {{details of the}} design, fabrication, assembly, alignment, and laboratory performance of the VisAO camera and its optical components. Many of these components required a custom design, such as the Spectral Differential Imaging Wollaston prisms and filters and the coronagraphic spots. One component, the Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC), required a unique triplet design that had until now never been fabricated and tested on sky. We present the design, laboratory, and on-sky results for our triplet ADC. We also present details of the CRO test setup and alignment. Because Magellan is a Gregorian telescope, the ASM is a concave ellipsoidal mirror. By simulating a star with a white light point source at the far conjugate, we can create a double-pass test of the whole system {{without the need for}} a real on-sky star. This allows us to test the AO system closed loop in the Arcetri test tower at its <b>nominal</b> design <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> and optical conjugates. The CRO test will also allow us to calibrate and verify the system off-sky at the Magellan telescope during commissioning and periodically thereafter. We present a design for a possible future upgrade path for a new visible Integral Field Spectrograph. By integrating a fiber array bundle at the VisAO focal plane, we can send light to a pre-existing facility spectrograph, such as LDSS 3, which will allow 20 mas spatial sampling and R~ 1, 800 spectra over the band 0. 6 - 1. 05 μm. This would be the highest spatial resolution IFU to date, either from the ground or in space...|$|R
50|$|The two {{fundamental}} parameters of an optical lens are the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> and the maximum aperture.

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of effective camera <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> {{is crucial to}} the success of panoramic image stitching. Fast techniques for estimating the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> exist, but are dependent upon a close initial approximation or the existence of a full circle panoramic image sequence. Numerical solutions of the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> demonstrate strong coupling between the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> and the angles used to position each component image about the common spherical center. This paper demonstrates that parameterizing image position using distance over the sphere surface instead of angles effectively decouples the <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> from the image position. This new parameterization does not require an initial <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> estimate for quick convergence, nor does it require a full circle panorama in order to refine the <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> Experiments with synthetic and real image sets demonstrate the robustness of the method and a speedup of 5 to 20 times over angle based positioning...|$|R

50|$|One can {{see that}} if {{magnification}} remains constant, a longer <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> results in a smaller axial magnification, and a smaller <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> a larger axial magnification. That is, when using a longer <b>focal</b> <b>length</b> while moving the camera/lens away from the object to maintain the same magnification M, objects seem shallower, and the axial distances between objects seem shorter.

We collected three portrait photographs of 45 (22 females, 23 males) participants under standardized conditions and camera setting varying only in the <b>focal</b> <b>length.</b> Subsequently, the three photographs from each individual were shown on screen in a randomized order using a 3 -alternative forced-choice paradigm. The images were judged for attractiveness, dominance, and femininity/masculinity by 369 raters (193 females, 176 males). Facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) was measured from each photograph and overall facial shape was analysed employing geometric morphometric methods (GMM).
