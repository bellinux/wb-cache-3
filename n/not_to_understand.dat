5000|$|In {{the last}} verses of chapter 3, the Kaushitaki Upanishad asserts that {{to really know}} someone, one must know his soul. Know {{the soul of the}} subject, not just {{superficial}} objects. The structure of its argument is as follows (abridged), One should <b>not</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the speech but should desire to know him who speaks,One should <b>not</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the smell (described by a person) but should desire to know him who smells,One should <b>not</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the form (of the person) but should desire to know him who sees the form,One should <b>not</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the sound (described) but should desire to know him who hears,One should <b>not</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the food (description) but should desire to know him who tastes,One should <b>not</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the deed but should desire to know him who performs the deed,One should <b>not</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> pleasure and pain from excitation but should desire to know him who feels the pleasure and pain,One should <b>not</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the opinion and thinking but should desire to know him who opines and thinks.Because if there were no elements of consciousness, there would be no elements of material beingBecause if there were no elements of material being, there would be no elements of consciousnessBecause any one phenomenon does not come about through the one without the other,Because Prana (life-force) is also the Prajnatman (knowledge-self), is bliss, is not ageing, is immortalThis is my Atman (soul) which one should know, O! this is my Atman which one should know.

Among the group of contributors, several had already been victims of Maiorescu's irony: Sion, Urechia, Pantazi Ghica and Petru Grădișteanu. While welcoming the debut of its contributor, Parnassian-Neoclassicist novelist and poet Duiliu Zamfirescu, Macedonski repeatedly attacked its main exponent, the conservative poet Eminescu, claiming <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> his poetry.

25|$|If {{religious}} liberty includes, as it must, {{the right to}} communicate such experiences to others, {{it seems to me}} an impossible task for juries to separate fancied ones from real ones, dreams from happenings, and hallucinations from true clairvoyance. Such experiences, like some tones and colors, have existence for one, but none at all for another. They cannot be verified to the minds of those whose field of consciousness does not include religious insight.

25|$|The American {{economist}} and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman {{has suggested that}} he fails {{to understand how the}} short term costs of euro membership to the Finnish economy outweigh the large gains caused by greater integration with the European economy. Krugman notes, that Sweden which has yet to join the single currency, had similar rates of growth compared to Finland for the period since the introduction of the euro. Membership of the euro protects Finland from currency fluctuation, which is particularly important for small member states of the European Union like Finland that are highly integrated into the larger European economy. If Finland had retained its own currency, an unpredictable exchange rates would prevent the country from selling its products at competitive prices on the European market. In fact, business leaders in Sweden, which is obliged to join the euro when its economy has converged with the eurozone, are almost universal in their support for joining the euro. Although Sweden's currency is not officially pegged to the euro like Denmark's currency the Swedish government maintains an unofficial peg. This exchange rate policy has in the short term benefited the Swedish economy in two ways; (1) much of Sweden's European trade is already denominated in euros and therefore bypasses any currency fluctuation and exchange rate losses, (2) it allows Sweden's non euro-area exports to remain competitive by dampening any pressure from the financial markets to increase the value of the currency. Maintaining this balance has allowed the Swedish government to borrow on the international financial markets at record low interest rates and allowed the Swedish central bank to quantitatively ease into a fundamentally sound economy. This has led Sweden's economy to prosper at the expense of less sound economies who have been impacted by the 2008 financial crisis. Sweden's economic performance has therefore been slightly better than Finland's since the financial crisis of 2008. Much of this disparity has, however, been due to the economic dominance of Nokia, Finlands largest company and Finland's only major multinational. Nokia supported and greatly benefited from the euro and the European single market, particularly from a common European digital mobile phone standard (GSM), but it failed to adapt when the market shifted to mobile computing. One reason for the popularity of the euro in Finland is the memory of a 'great depression' which began in 1990, with Finland not regaining it competitiveness until approximately a decade later when Finland joined the single currency. Some American economists like Paul Krugman claim <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the benefits of a single currency and allege that poor economic performance is the result of membership of the single currency. These economists do not, however, advocate separate currencies for member states within the American union, many of which have quite disparate economies.|$|E

500|$|Another {{account in}} this series is [...] "Ivan Turbincă", whose protagonist, a Russian serviceman, is shown rebelling against Heaven and Hell, and {{ultimately}} accomplishing the human ideal of cheating Death. The plot retells a theme present in both Romanian tradition and Ukrainian folklore, while, according to researcher of children's literature Muguraș Constantinescu, the main character is similar to German tradition's Till Eulenspiegel. In {{the beginning of the}} account, God rewards the soldier's exemplary charity by granting him a pouch (turbincă), which can miraculously trap anything in existence. In order to circumvent the laws of nature, Ivan subsequently makes use of both his magical item and his innate shrewdness. In one such episode, pretending <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the proper position of bodies inside a coffin, he tricks impatient Death into taking his place, and traps her inside. Eventually, he is allowed to keep his life, but is promised an eternity of old age, which he ingeniously counterbalances by attending an endless succession of wedding parties, and therefore never having to feel sad.|$|E
