For a wooden container to be a crate, all six of its sides must {{be put in place}} to result in the rated strength of the container. Crates are distinct from <b>wooden</b> <b>boxes.</b> The strength of a <b>wooden</b> <b>box</b> is rated based on the weight it can carry before the top (top, ends, and sides) is installed, whereas the strength of a crate is rated with the top in place. In general conversation, the term crate is sometimes used to denote a <b>wooden</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{study focused}} on the {{population}} dynamics and food habits of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) was investigated at Sierra Summit Ski Area, Lakeshore, CA, USA during the summers of 1993 and 1994. Live trapping of the yellow-bellied marmots was the preferred method of collecting data for this project and {{it was estimated that}} a minimum of 14 traps were needed to adequately cover the study site. However, there were a limited number of commercially-built wire traps available, thus the need to construct box traps made of plywood. Approximately 45 min was required to construct a <b>wooden</b> <b>box</b> trap. Yellow-bellied marmots were successfully captured in all 11 <b>wooden</b> <b>box</b> traps throughout the study period. Seventy-eight percent of the 117 captured marmots were caught in the <b>wooden</b> <b>box</b> traps. In addition, there was a statistically significant (chi-square, P < 0. 05) difference in trap type success between the commercial wire traps and the <b>wooden</b> <b>box</b> traps. The <b>wooden</b> <b>box</b> traps higher capture rate may be due to trap preparation before baiting and the amount of cover provided by the trap...|$|R
