5|$|A {{native of}} Chiprovtsi {{and one of}} Bulgaria's most educated people of the 17th century, Parchevich was among {{the leaders of the}} Bulgarian Roman Catholics. His {{numerous}} diplomatic visits to the royal courts of Europe were mostly in an attempt to garner support for an anti-Ottoman uprising in Bulgaria, which he did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> to witness. Nevertheless, his efforts in defending Christianity earned him a noble title from the Austrian emperors, and he took up several important positions within the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Arundel was {{considered}} a great soldier by his contemporaries.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, the Ho-Chunk tribe was {{compelled}} to cede the lead mining region to the United States. The Americans also increased their military presence on the frontier, building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts. The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could <b>not</b> <b>live</b> peaceably together, and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward, a policy known as Indian removal. The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832, which involved many of the same people and concerned similar issues.|$|E

Rimsky-Korsakov stood in for him at the second of these events, an all-Tchaikovsky concert in memory of the composer, on December 12, 1893. The program included the Fourth Symphony, Francesca da Rimini, Marche Slave and some solo piano works played by Felix Blumenfeld.|$|E
5|$|Benbow's {{fame and}} success earned him both public notoriety and a {{promotion}} to admiral. He was then {{involved in an}} incident during the Action of August 1702, where {{a number of his}} captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships. Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, though he did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> to see these results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture.|$|E

5|$|By 1939, Low Fell {{had become}} the select suburb of Gateshead and had {{substantial}} and independent shopping facilities.

5|$|By January 1943, Himmler {{reported}} that 629,000 ethnic Germans had been resettled; however, most resettled Germans did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> in the envisioned small farms, but in temporary camps or quarters in towns.

Himmler instructed that the German nation should view all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their German blood. In accordance with German racial laws, sexual relations between Germans and foreigners were forbidden as Rassenschande (race defilement).|$|E

5|$|He was {{particularly}} interested in dementia praecox (which he favored renaming schizophrenia), and found diffuse anatomic differences in the brains of schizophrenic patients. These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades. Serious attention to Southard's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s, but changes in diagnostic criteria complicate the application of Southard's findings to modern schizophrenic patients. Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non-dementia non-praecox: note on the advantages to mental hygiene of extirpating a term, but did <b>not</b> <b>live</b> to see it published.|$|E
