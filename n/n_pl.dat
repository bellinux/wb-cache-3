In “Beneath this Roof,” a young housewife’s life is rocked by a visit from an old friend who has changed in unexpected ways. “Semantics (<b>n.</b> <b>pl.)</b> ” follows a sixty-two-year old widow {{in the early stages of}} Alzheimer’s. Her fragile grasp on her work and her words is ultimately challenged by the appearance of a man who reminds her of her recently dead husband. In “En Plein Air,” a newly married artist finally finds inspiration to paint in the midst of an unhappy marriage and hostile climate. A young bird keeper in “Enclosure” butts heads with her family when trying to explain her lack of desire for a romantic relationship. And finally, in “Surrogate,” a twenty-year old sitter for an elderly man struggles with her parents’ violent murders and her complicated relationship with this gentle eighty-year old suffering from Alzheimer’s.

40|$|Growth {{estimates}} of complex orthogonal polynomials {{with respect to}} the area measure supported by a disjoint union of planar Jordan domains (called, in short, an archipelago) are obtained by a combination of methods of potential theory and rational approximation theory. The study of the asymptotic behavior of the roots of these polynomials reveals a surprisingly rich geometry, which reflects three characteristics: the relative position of an island in the archipelago, the analytic continuation picture of the Schwarz function of every individual boundary and the singular points of the exterior Green function. By way of explicit example, fine asymptotics are obtained for the lemniscate archipelago |z m − 1 | < r m, 0 < r < 1, which consists of m islands. The asymptotic analysis of the Christoffel functions associated to the same orthogonal polynomials leads to a very accurate reconstruction algorithm of the shape of the archipelago, knowing only finitely many of its power moments. This work naturally complements a 1969 study by H. Widom of Szegő orthogonal polynomials on an archipelago and the more recent asymptotic analysis of Bergman orthogonal polynomials unveiled by the last two authors and their collaborators.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{powerful}} {{number is}} a positive integer n satisfying the property that p divides n whenever the prime p divides n; i. e., in the canonical prime decomposition of n, no prime appears with exponent I. In [I], S. W. Golomb introduced and studied such numbers. In particular, he asked whether (25, 27) is the only pair of consecutive odd powerful numbers. This question was settled in [2] by W. A. Sentance who gave necessary and sufficient conditions {{for the existence of}} such pairs. The first result {{of this paper is to}} provide a generalization of Sentance’s result by giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of pairs of powerful numbers spaced evenly apart. This result leads us naturally to consider integers which are representable as a proper difference of two powerful numbers, i. e. <b>n</b> <b>Pl</b> P 2 where Pl and P 2 are powerful numbers with g. c. d. (PI ’ P 2 I. Golomb (op. cit.) conjectured that 6 is not a proper difference of two powerful numbers, and that there are infinitely many numbers which cannot be represented as a proper difference of two powerful numbers. The antithesis of this conjecture was proved by W. L. McDaniel [3] who verified that every non-zero integer is in fact a proper difference of tw...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Computer vision {{systems that}} {{identify}} and localize instances of predefined 3 -D models in images offer many potential benefits to industrial and other environments. In {{many of these}} areas, solid models of the parts to be recognized already exist, and redesign of the part geometry for vision tasks should be avoided. This paper describes BONSAI, which is a model-based 3 -D object recognition system, which identifies and localizes 3 -D objects in range images {{of one or more}} parts that have been designed on a computer-aided design (CAD) system. Recognition is performed via constrained search of the interpretation tree, using unary and binary constraints (derived automatically from the CAD models) to prune the search space. We focus our attention on the recognition procedure, but we also outline the model-building, image acquisition, and segmentation procedures. Experiments with over 200 images demonstrate that the constrained search approach to 3 -D object recognition has comparable accuracy to other existing systems.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of PhysicsJingyu LinIII-nitride {{nanostructures}} {{and devices}} were synthesized by metal organic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (MOCVD) for their applications in various photonic, optoelectronic, and energy devices such as deep ultraviolet (DUV) photodetectors, solar cells, visible emitters, thermometric (TE) power generators, etc. Structural and optical properties in thicker AlN epilayers {{were found to be}} better than those in thinner AlN epilayers. Full-width at half maxima (FWHM) of x-ray diffraction (XRD) rocking curves as small as 63 and 437 arcsec were measured at (002) and (102) reflections, respectively in a thick AlN epilayer (4 m). The dark current of the fabricated AlN detectors decreases drastically as AlN epilayer thickness increases. DUV photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were employed to study the effect of biaxial stress in AlN epilayers grown on different substrates. Stress-induced band gap shift of 45 meV/GPa was obtained in AlN epilayers. The potential of InGaN alloys as TE materials for thermopower generation has been investigated. It was found that as In content increases, thermal conductivity decreases and power factor increases, which leads to an increase in the TE figure of merit (ZT). The value of ZT was found to be 0. 08 at 300 K and reached 0. 23 at 450 K for In 0. 36 Ga 0. 64 N alloy, which is comparable to that of SiGe based alloys. Single phase InxGa 1 −xN alloys inside the theoretically predicted miscibility gap region (x = 0. 4 to 0. 7) were successfully synthesized. A single peak of XRD - 2  scans of the (002) plane in InGaN alloys confirms that there is no phase separation. Electrical properties and surface morphologies were found to be reasonably good. It was found that growth rate should be high enough (> 400 nm/hr) to achieve high quality and single phase InxGa 1 −xN alloys in this miscibility gap region. Mg-doped InxGa 1 -xN alloys were synthesized and characterized by Hall-effect and PL measurements for their application as visible emitters. P-type conductivity was measured up to x = 0. 35 with accepter activation energy as low as 43 meV, which is about 4 times lower than that of Mg-doped p-type GaN.
