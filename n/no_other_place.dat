5|$|Body {{piercing}} in some religions is {{held to be}} {{destructive to}} the body. Some passages of the Bible, including Leviticus 19:28, have been interpreted as prohibiting body modification because the body is held to be the property of God. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has taken an official position against most piercings unless for medical reasons, although they accept piercings for women {{as long as there}} is only one set of piercings in the lower lobe of the ears and <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>place</b> on the body. Wearing of very large nose rings on Shabbat is forbidden by the Talmud.|$|E
25|$|The {{downtown}} area contains six buildings from 1819–50, 327 buildings from 1851–1900, and 1188 buildings from the 20th century. There is <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>place</b> in the Caribbean which contains such a remarkable cluster of Neoclassical structures.|$|E

Colonial buildings {{influenced by the}} Portuguese, Dutch and British exist alongside structures built in Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Indian and Contemporary architectural styles. <b>No</b> <b>other</b> <b>place</b> is this more evident in the Fort area.

50|$|Beginning in 1321, {{the village}} cropped {{up under the}} names Hettelrodt and Hettenrodt in feudal bonds of the Idarbann (a feudal domain), and shared fate with its {{outlying}} village, Idar. To this day, Hettenrodt’s mother church stands in Idar, and <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>places</b> in the old Idarbann show such conformity in their local speech as Idar and Hettenrodt.|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} of Peter in Rome, not explicitly affirmed in, but consistent with, the New Testament, is explicitly affirmed by Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus of Lyon and other early Christian writers – and <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>place</b> has ever {{claimed to be}} the location of his death. The same witnesses imply that Peter was the virtual founder of the Church of Rome, though not its founder in the sense of initiating a Christian community there. They also speak of Peter as the one who initiated its episcopal succession, but speak of Linus as the first bishop of Rome after Peter, although some hold today that the Christians in Rome did not act a single united community under a single leader until the 2nd century.|$|E
25|$|In 1447, Johannes Mentelin {{gained the}} rights of a Strasbourg citizen. He was first a Goldschreiber (calligrapher and book scribe) by {{profession}} and worked in addition as an episcopal notary. Exactly when and where he learned the technique of book printing is not known. Since {{at the end of}} the 1450s, when Mentelin founded his Strasbourg printery, there was still <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>place</b> where printing was done besides Mainz, it is likely that he either got his knowledge directly there or through a middleman. Such a go-between might have been Heinrich Eggestein. It is suspected that he had been introduced to the trade of book printing during his stay in Mainz from Johannes Gutenberg. He did not set up his own Offizin (an old German term for a book printery) until the middle of the 1460s. Due to a lack of sources, the final clarification of this question must unfortunately remain unanswered for now. From the available data, it can however be concluded that Mentelin was the first book printer active in Strasbourg (and thus one of the first anywhere in Europe), even before Eggestein.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{praised the}} game's combat and pacing. G4 called the game's combat [...] "sublime," [...] {{and said that}} [...] "no Infinity Engine game thus far has had such {{interesting}} and intricate tactical combat." [...] GameSpot called it [...] "expertly paced." [...] PC Zone complained that certain gameplay mechanics had become outdated, but that [...] "the only real downer is the antiquated spell system and the inexplicable necessity to rest after every fight." [...] The game was also praised for its implementation of the Third Edition rules and interface. Computer Gaming World said that [...] "IWD II has the Third Edition rules down, and in <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>place</b> in the game is it more apparent than with character development," [...] and PC Gamer said it had [...] "a dazzling implementation of the D 3rd Edition rules." [...] GameSpot called the interface [...] "a big improvement on the spread-out interface of all previous Infinity Engine games," [...] and IGN said that [...] "the customization improvements to the interface that seem so natural, they make you wonder why they weren't thought of before." [...] Game Informer called the interface [...] "absolutely inspired" [...] and its inventory system [...] "second to none." ...|$|E
50|$|Her uncompromising {{approach}} to discipline led to problems. When two sisters won {{a court case}} challenging their expulsion, the bad publicity meant that both the school and Jex-Blake herself lost support, and some students moved to Glasgow, London and Dublin; there were <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>places</b> in Great Britain or Ireland where women could study medicine at that time.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a parade}} of shops on Westbury Lane. There used to be, close to the road bridge and near the {{northern}} end of Coombe Lane, a [...] "tin" [...] (i.e. corrugated iron) Methodist chapel.

2500|$|Blackstone's Memorial {{was signed}} by several hundred {{prominent}} Americans, and received wide attention. Although the Memorial did not contain the phrase [...] "land without a people", shortly after returning from his trip to Palestine in 1881 Blackstone had written, also {{in the context of}} his concern over the fate of the Jews of the Russian Pale, [...] "And now, this very day, we stand {{face to face with the}} awful dilemma, that these millions cannot remain where they are, and yet have <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>place</b> to go...

2500|$|Crosby left {{money in}} her will for [...] "the {{sheltering}} of senior males who had <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>place</b> to live, with these men {{to pay a}} nominal fee to the home for their living expenses". In 1923, the King's Daughters of the First Methodist Church of Bridgeport, Connecticut honored Crosby's request to memorialize her by beginning to raise the additional funds needed to establish the Fanny Crosby Memorial Home for the Aged. The non-denominational home {{was established in the}} former Hunter house at 1008 Fairfield Avenue, Bridgeport; it opened on November 1, 1925 after a national drive by the Federation of Churches to raise $100,000 to operate it. It operated until 1996 when it was given to the Bridgeport Rescue Mission.|$|E

There are 10 {{abortion}} clinics in Louisiana; five of those are in New Orleans. They have a Southern Decadence parade every year and they call it gay pride. When you study Scripture, it's not out of the boundaries of God to punish a nation for sin and because of sin. When I look at our country, at what's happening, and what's happening in New Orleans in particular, it's not beyond the realm of possibility." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{decision}} upset both {{painters and}} the general public. This must {{be seen in the}} contemporary social context, because the Willink van Collenprijs had become a national institution. As a consequence, a petition to protest this practice was signed by 29 artists, including famous names like Hendrik Willem Mesdag, the brothers Jacob and Willem Maris, Paul Gabriël and Louis Apol. Giving in to the pressure, a competition was organized again in 1896. According to the new rules, there would only be a first prize, and <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>places.</b> In the years 1897, 1906, 1909 and 1910, multiple [...] "first prizes" [...] were awarded.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout its history, Barrington Hall had a {{reputation}} for supporting social and political activism. In 1960, [...] "Cal undergrads, particularly residents of the Barrington Hall co-op on Dwight Way, were part of the crowd of demonstrators protesting against the San Francisco meeting of the House Committee on Un-American Activities." [...] By the time of the People's Park Riots in May 1969, Barrington Hall, which was only two blocks from People's Park, was an infamous place in Berkeley. The devotion to cooperation in a nation committed to competition bore radical fruit after thirty-five years. Barrington became a 'safe house' for deviance, good or ill. It was safe for unmarried men and women to live together, safe to paint and draw on the walls, safe to do or sell any drug, safe to crash in if you had <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>place</b> to stay. In the 1970s and 1980s, some of its members were very active in the anti-apartheid movement, and offered sanctuary and meals to the homeless. In 1984, Barrington residents voted to make the Hall open as an official sanctuary for refugees from El Salvador.|$|E
