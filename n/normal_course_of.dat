5|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} testing a specific integrin, alpha-six-beta-one, and the role it plays in the RMS. The study researched the principle that chemoattractive molecules may {{play an important role}} in neuroblast migration in the RMS. The study of this one particular integrin was conducted in mice. By using antibodies to bind to α6β1 integrin subunits, found on the neuroblasts, the researchers observed that the migration was disrupted. Furthermore, they investigated the mechanism through which α6β1 integrin functions and determined it was via the chemoattractant laminin. This was completed by injecting laminin perpendicular to the RMS and observing that doing so drew “neuroblasts away from their <b>normal</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> migration”. The researchers concluded with the idea that this research could prove useful for therapeutics purposes in that neuroblasts could potentially be drawn to locations of injury or disease.|$|E
5|$|Steiner {{differentiated}} offers, {{threats and}} throffers {{based on the}} preferability of compliance and noncompliance for the subject {{when compared to the}} <b>normal</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable {{than it would have been}} were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of coercion, and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|E

25|$|Research {{has shown}} that sub-therapeutic levels of β-lactam {{antibiotics}} induce biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus.

The biofilm formation induced by low-level methicillin was inhibited by DNase, suggesting that the sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotic also induce extracellular DNA release. Moreover, from an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide advanced therapeutic ways for chronic infections caused by biofilms via genetically engineered invasive cheaters who can invade wild-types ‘cooperators’ of pathogenic bacteria until cooperator populations go to extinction or overall population ‘cooperators and cheaters ’ go to extinction.|$|E

40|$|Two {{developmental}} {{systems for}} leaves of Festuca pratensis were compared, namely development along the leaf (base to apex) {{and development of}} the whole leaf with time. The methods for examination of nucleic acids from leaves of F. pratensis were optimised and the changes occurring in rRNA fractions, tRNAs and polyribosomes during both developmental systems were recorded. These changes were related to changes in levels and syntheses of soluble and particulate proteins. Activities of enzymes intimately involved in these relationships, namely RNAses, ATPases, phosphatases, pyrophosphatases and phosphodiesterases were monitored during development. The metabolic status was further examined by the study of the polypeptide - synthesizing capacity of the ribosomes at different stages as revealed in wheatgerm- derived cell-free systems. Three phases of increased metabolism were apparent in both developmental systems but only the initial and final phases involved increased RNA synthesis which was correlated with increased protein synthetic capacity.
