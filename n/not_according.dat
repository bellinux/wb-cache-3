5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} vandalism and violence, only twenty arrests {{were made on}} the day. The strikers intimidated the police, {{and only a few}} were willing to arrest vandals. Chief Hyland and many officers were sympathetic to the strike, but the local judicial magistrates were <b>not.</b> <b>According</b> to one union report, union members who were arrested faced fines up to $50, while the arrested strikebreakers were immediately acquitted by a local judge.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially {{when a person is}} attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of the}} imminent or ongoing attack, and <b>not</b> <b>according</b> to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E
5|$|Roger of Hoveden {{described}} Uhtred of Galloway as a consanguinus ("cousin") of King Henry II of England, {{an assertion}} {{that has given}} rise to the theory that, since Gille-Brighde is never described as such, they must have been from different mothers. Fergus must therefore, according to the theory, have had two wives, one of whom was a bastard daughter of Henry I; that is, Uhtred and his descendants were related to the English royal family, while Gille-Brighde and his descendants were <b>not.</b> <b>According</b> to historian G.W.S. Barrow, the theory is disproved by one English royal document, written in the name of King John of England, which likewise asserts that Donnchadh was John's cousin.|$|E

5|$|Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia {{defines a}} Malay as a Malaysian citizen {{born to a}} Malaysian citizen who professes to be a Muslim, habitually speaks the Malay language, adheres to Malay customs, and is {{domiciled}} in Malaysia or Singapore. Though this definition is <b>not</b> <b>according</b> to ancestry lineage, it is however correct {{in the sense of}} social behaviours. Culture, which controls a great proportion of general mentality and social behaviour, is succeeded through the mother tongue and religion. Article 160 unites Malays from different ethnic groups as the prevailing race and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate and rule over other races: Chinese, Indians, Kadazan, Iban, Orang Asli etc. This is also apparent from the name of UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), who are a staunch political proponent of this role.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of Lebanon's Identity Card is {{the main}} form of {{identification}} on {{the territory of the}} Republic of Lebanon. All Lebanese are obliged by law to carry their identity cards with them at all times and are subject to fines should they <b>not.</b> <b>According</b> to the Lebanese obligation of identification, it is compulsory for all Lebanese citizens habitually resident in the Republic of Lebanon, aged 15 or older, to possess either an identity card or a passport noting that the earlier offers no benefits compared to the passport with the exception of being easier to carry in a wallet or a handbag. It enables bearers to log into certain services on the Internet, local computers or add a digital signatures into LibreOffice ODF documents or create DigiDoc formatted containers that also allows encryption during content transfer. While police officers and some other officials have a right to demand to see one of these documents, the law does not state that one is obliged to submit the document at that very moment.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} other points which cast serious doubt on Leod's {{traditional}} ancestry. In 1265, Magnus, King of Mann, the last king of this Manx dynasty died. Later in 1275, Magnus's illegitimate son, Godfrey died while leading a revolt. At least two women later {{came forward with}} claims for the kingdom—yet Leod and his sons did <b>not.</b> <b>According</b> to W.D.H. Sellar, {{it is hard to}} believe that a descendant of the royal line would not have put forward a claim. Another point put forward is that the MacLeods did not adopt the royal names of the 13th century Manx dynasty—names such as Godfrey (Old Norse: Guðrøðr; Gaelic: Gofraid), Ranald (Old Norse Rögnvaldr; Gaelic: Raghnall), Olaf (Old Norse Óláfr; Gaelic Amlaíb), and Harald (Old Norse Haraldr; Gaelic Aralt). Sellar illustrated his point by noting the royal names adopted by the descendants of Somerled (d.1164) and his wife Ragnhild, daughter of Olaf the Red (grandfather of Olaf the Black).|$|E
