50|$|With {{regard to}} {{plant and animal}} diversity, {{the area of the}} Plitvice Lakes belongs to the most {{significant}} areas of Croatia. On the one hand, this is due to climatic conditions {{and on the other hand}} due to the location of this area, since the lakes are far away from polluted and <b>noisy</b> cities or <b>industrial</b> <b>plants.</b> For reasons of the poor industrial development of this region and early introduced protection measures, a nearly untouched landscape has been preserved. In the partially primeval beech and fir forests various rare species, such as the brown bear have survived. At the Plitvice Lakes, all species continue to exist that have already existed before the coming of man. This is a rare case worldwide.|$|R
