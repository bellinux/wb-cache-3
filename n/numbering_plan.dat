5|$|In April 1958, the MSHD {{wanted to}} provide a single number for a more direct routing of a Detroit–Chicago freeway; the state {{proposed}} rerouting I-94 to replace I-92 in the state, but retained the I-77 designation. On June 27, 1958, AASHO adopted their original <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> for Michigan, minus the state's proposed changes. Around the same time, a section of M-146 near Port Huron was converted into an approach freeway for the Blue Water Bridge.|$|E
5|$|MSHD {{had plans}} to upgrade the US16 {{corridor}} to freeway standards {{in the middle of}} the 20th century. The first planning map in 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System showed a highway in the corridor. The General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955, or Yellow Book after the cover color, showed generalized plans for the locations of Interstate Highways as designated in 1955. This also included a highway in the US16 corridor. The 1957 approval for the Interstate Highway System replaced much of US16 with a portion of Interstate 94 (I-94). MSHD submitted a recommended <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> for the Interstates in 1958 that showed I-96 following the US16 corridor.|$|E
5|$|One major {{controversy}} {{related to}} the preliminary route of US 50. The through route {{had been assigned to}} the Old Santa Fe Trail, while the spur U.S. Route 250 followed the competing New Santa Fe Trail to the south. As a compromise, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways approved a split configuration—U.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S—in January. Another problem was in western Utah, where no improved road existed for US 50 to use. The final <b>numbering</b> <b>plan,</b> approved in November 1926, left a gap in US 50 between Ely, Nevada and Thistle, Utah. Finally, rather than ending US 50 at Wadsworth, where the Lincoln and Victory Highways merged, it was sent over the Lincoln Highway's Pioneer Branch, past the south side of Lake Tahoe, to Sacramento, California.|$|E
50|$|<b>Numbering</b> <b>plans</b> {{may follow}} {{a variety of}} design {{strategies}} which have often arisen from the historical evolution of individual telephone networks and local requirements.

5|$|A north–south freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing through traffic {{to bypass the}} city of Detroit. This plan {{was included in the}} 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System. The Yellow Book contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Detroit area including a north–south freeway east of the current I-275 corridor. The 1958 <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> for Michigan submitted by the State Highway Department had this route initially marked as I-73. William Swanson in the MDOT Highway Planning Unit later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I-75 and I-275 between Newport and Davisburg; I-75 would have bypassed downtown Detroit just as it bypassed downtown Flint and downtown Saginaw to the north, and the auxiliary number (I-275) would have been used on the freeway through downtown Detroit.|$|E

The 1957 approval for the Interstate Highway System replaced the Grand Rapids–Detroit section of US16 with a portion of Interstate 94 (I-94), with the remainder to be I-94N. MSHD submitted a recommended <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> for the Interstates in 1958 that showed I-96 following the US16 corridor. When initially approved, the Muskegon–Grand Rapids segment of US16 was to be numbered as I-196 while the remainder was part of I-96.|$|E
5|$|With Interstate funding assured, MDSHA {{commissioned}} the Baltimore–Annapolis Transportation Corridor Study in 1973 to figure out, among other things, the best route for the Baltimore–Annapolis Interstate. The study discovered a western route following the MD 3 and MD 178 corridors {{would be less}} disruptive and require fewer acquisitions of homes and businesses compared to {{an extension of the}} Arundel Expressway south along the MD 2 corridor. In June 1979, MDSHA announced plans for I-97. The original route <b>numbering</b> <b>plan,</b> which was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) at its November 1975 meeting, was for I-97 to include its current route plus US 50 from Parole west to I-95 (Capital Beltway). That proposal included two auxiliary Interstate highways. I-197 would follow US 50 and US 301 east from I-97 to just west of the Severn River. I-297 would follow MD 3 between a pair of intersections with I-97 in Millersville and Bowie. AASHTO rescinded its approval of the 1975 plan at its June 1981 meeting, then approved what was essentially the original 1975 plan at its June 1982 meeting. The east–west segment of I-97 and I-197 was replaced by I-68. I-297 was withdrawn by request of the state of Maryland in 1983. The 1982 concept of I-68 became unsigned I-595 and I-68 was applied to the National Freeway in Western Maryland in 1991 after AASHTO approved the new designations at its June 1989 meeting.|$|E

All central offices within a larger region, typically aggregated by state, were assigned a common <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> area code. With the development of international and transoceanic telephone trunks, especially driven by direct customer dialing, similar efforts of systematic organization of the telephone networks occurred in many countries in the mid-20th century.|$|E

25|$|In {{the most}} areas of North America, {{telephone}} numbers in metropolitan communities {{consisted of a}} combination of digits and letters, starting in the 1920s until the 1960s. Letters were translated to dialed digits, a mapping that was displayed directly on the telephone dial. Each of the digits 2 to 9, and sometimes 0, corresponded to a group of typically three letters. The leading two or three letters of a telephone number indicated the exchange name, for example, EDgewood and IVanhoe, and were followed by 5 or 4 digits. The limitations that these system presented in terms of usable names that were easy to distinguish and spell, and the need for a comprehensive <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> that enabled direct-distance dialing, led to the introduction of all-number dialing in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, many local {{telephone}} companies, {{as well as}} the North American <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan</b> of 1947, prescribed telephone number formats that included the name of the central office to which each telephone was connected. Traditionally, these names were often the names of towns, villages, other locally significant names, but larger communities that required more than one central office, may have used other names for each central office, such as Main, East, West, Central. Names were convenient to use and reduced errors when telephone numbers were exchanged verbally between subscribers and operators. When subscribers could dial themselves, the initial letters of the names were converted to digits as displayed on the rotary dial. Thus, telephone numbers contained one, two, or even three letters followed by up to five numerals. Such numbering plans are called 2L-4N, or simply 2-4, for example, as shown in the photo of a telephone dial of 1939 (right). In this example, LAkewood 2697, indicates that a subscriber dialed the letters L and A, then the digits 2, 6, 9, and 7 to reach this telephone in Lakewood, NJ (USA).|$|E
