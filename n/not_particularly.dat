5|$|Walruses prefer shallow shelf {{regions and}} forage {{primarily}} on the sea floor, often from sea ice platforms.

5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and <b>not</b> <b>particularly</b> pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose {{made his}} {{debut in the}} English County Championship for Northamptonshire County Cricket Club in 1989—the club signed him for the 1988 season but as he was playing in the West Indies touring team, he was {{unavailable}} that year. He took a wicket with his first delivery for the club, but was <b>not</b> <b>particularly</b> successful {{in the first part}} of the season; he settled down later and took 28 first-class wickets at 28.39 for Northamptonshire in nine games.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 14 in 1904, Kilner {{reached the}} Mitchell Main first team. Although {{selected}} regularly from 1905, Kilner was <b>not</b> <b>particularly</b> successful with the bat. He displayed aggression but often attempted difficult shots and consequently lost his wicket. His bowling was more effective but used infrequently. By 1909 his batting improved; he scored his first century for the team and began to make consistently good scores, attracting the attention of Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{relatively}} weak and disorganized nature of the storm, impact throughout its path was widespread, but <b>not</b> <b>particularly</b> severe. Puerto Rico bore {{the brunt of the}} storm, followed by the United States Virgin Islands, then the Dominican Republic. Debby was attributed to about $735,000 in damage and 1indirect fatality, which occurred in Puerto Rico when a man fell off a roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the ACLU, Baldwin {{continued}} as its leader. His charisma and energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks. Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, pinching pennies, and living on a very small salary. The ACLU was directed by an executive committee, but it was <b>not</b> <b>particularly</b> democratic or egalitarian. The ACLU's base in New York resulted in its being dominated by people from the city and state. Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the Garland Fund.|$|E

5|$|Further {{scattered}} details can {{be found}} in Pausanias's Description of Greece, while the Byzantine Suda dictionary of the 10th century AD preserves some anecdotes found nowhere else. Minor sources for the period include the works of Pompeius Trogus (epitomized by Justinus), Cornelius Nepos and Ctesias of Cnidus (epitomized by Photius), which are not in their original textual form. These works are not considered reliable (especially Ctesias), and are <b>not</b> <b>particularly</b> useful for reconstructing the history of this period.|$|E
5|$|Gilberto is good {{at helping}} to defend against opponents who play a long ball game because he often man marks the opposition's attacking target-man. This cuts off the opposition's supply to the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, {{something}} to which long-ball teams are <b>not</b> <b>particularly</b> suited.|$|E
5|$|Hazel: The protagonist, Fiver's brother; {{he leads}} the rabbits from Sandleford and {{eventually}} becomes Chief Rabbit. Though Hazel is <b>not</b> <b>particularly</b> large or powerful, he is loyal, brave, and a quick thinker. He sees the good in each individual, and what they bring to the table; in so doing, he makes sure that no one gets left behind, thus earning the respect and loyalty of his warren. He often relies on Fiver's advice, and trusts in his brother's instincts immensely.|$|E

5|$|Horses were {{specially}} bred for the joust, {{and heavier}} armour developed. However, {{this did not}} necessarily lead to significantly larger horses. Interpreters at the Royal Armouries, Leeds, re-created the joust, using specially bred horses and replica armour.

5|$|In late 1923, having {{decided not}} to return to Cambridge, Allen took {{a job in the}} City (London's {{financial}} district) working for the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation as an underwriter. <b>Not</b> <b>particularly</b> well-off financially, he had to work full-time and throughout his career could not afford to take too much time away from business. He played cricket as often as he could in the summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket—including for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—and country house cricket.|$|E
