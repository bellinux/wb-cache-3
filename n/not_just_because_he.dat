[...] Several months after this interview, the character was romantically linked to newcomer and former guest star, general surgical consultant Abra Durant, played by Adrian Edmondson. Edmondson departed from and returned to the show several times, with Kyla and Abra breaking up and reuniting on multiple occasions. Asked in February 2008 whether the two would ever get back together, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, but I love working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man." [...] The two ultimately left Holby together, moving to Ghana.|$|E
500|$|Barker {{began using}} the {{pseudonym}} Gerald Wiley when writing sketches because he wished the pieces {{to be accepted}} on merit and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he,</b> as a star of the programme, had written them; he continued this tradition with the material he wrote later in his career. Barker brought his sketches in, claiming they had come from Wiley through Barker's agent Peter Eade, {{and they were very}} well received. To maintain the deception, Barker had criticised material he himself had submitted under the pseudonym; when a Wiley-credited sketch about a ventriloquist had been poorly received by the audience Barker told Corbett [...] "Well, Gerald Wiley let us down there", and on another occasion, when looking at a script, [...] "I don't understand this line. What's he getting at?" [...] One of the first sketches he wrote was called [...] "Doctor's Waiting Room", with the main part written for Corbett. Barker encouraged Corbett to buy the rights to the sketch and, further maintaining the myth, told him to reject Wiley's 'request' for £3,000 as too expensive, before giving Corbett the sketch for free. Speculation began about Wiley's identity, with Tom Stoppard, Frank Muir, Alan Bennett and Noël Coward all rumoured. After the second series of Frost on Sunday, the cast and crew were invited to a Chinese restaurant, while Wiley said that he would reveal himself. Barker, who had told Corbett earlier in the day, stood up and announced he was Wiley, although initially nobody believed him.|$|E

2500|$|Burke {{believed}} that property {{was essential to}} human life. Because of his conviction that people desire to be ruled and controlled, the division of property {{formed the basis for}} social structure, helping develop control within a property-based hierarchy. He viewed the social changes brought on by property as the natural order of events, which should be taking place as the human race progressed. With the division of property and the class system, he also {{believed that}} it kept the monarch in check {{to the needs of the}} classes beneath the monarch. Since property largely aligned or defined divisions of social class, class too, was seen as natural—part of a social agreement that the setting of persons into different classes, is the mutual benefit of all subjects. Concern for property is not Burke's only influence. As Christopher Hitchens summarises, [...] "If modern conservatism can be held to derive from Burke, it is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> appealed to property owners in behalf of stability but also because he appealed to an everyday interest in the preservation of the ancestral and the immemorial." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Prince {{from the}} 2008 reboot was well {{received}} by video game critics, but criticized by {{fans of the}} series, whose main complaint was the performance of North in the role. In {{an article about the}} sexuality of the Prince of Persia reboot, Gamasutra editor Tom Cross stated that he finds the rejection of both the game and its protagonist incomprehensible. He compared Uncharted protagonist Nathan Drake to the Prince, stating that it was <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was voiced by , but also because the sexual tension that [...] holds reminded him of the prince. He addressed the criticism of his voice, stating that people found it annoying and improper for him to sound so much like a Han Solo-type character considering the video game is located in the Middle East. Cross found this criticism unfair, arguing that no one criticized female protagonist Elika's North American accent and added that the prince was a harder character to like than Nathan Drake, due to him being an [...] "unrepentant jerk" [...] instead of a [...] "lovable jerk," [...] but that merely makes him a harder sell.|$|E
60|$|Oh how men {{hate that}} message!--the {{message that the}} true wrath of God, necessary, inevitable, is {{revealed}} from heaven against all unrighteousness of men. How they writhe under it! How they shut their ears to it, and cry to their preachers, 'No! Tell us of any wrath of God but that!

Yes, tell us anything rather than that news, which cuts at the root of all our pride, of all our comfort, and all our superstition--the news that we cannot escape the consequences of our own actions; that there are no back stairs up which we may be smuggled into heaven; that as we sow, so we shall reap; that we are filled with the fruits of our own devices; every man his own poisoner, every man his own executioner, every man his own suicide; that hell begins in this life, and death begins before we die: --do not say that: because we cannot help believing it; for our own consciousness and our own experience tell us it is true.' No wonder that the preacher who tells men that is hated, is called a Rationalist, a Pantheist, a heretic, and what <b>not,</b> <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> does set forth such a living God, such a justice of God, such a wrath of God as would make the sinner tremble, if he believed in it, not merely once in a way, when he hears a stirring sermon about the endless torments: but all day long, going out and coming in, lying on his bed and walking by the way, always haunted by the shadow of himself, knowing that he is bearing about in him the perpetually growing death of sin.|$|E

6000|$|The Squire {{came out}} {{on the top of the}} rise, and all Worsted Scotton was in sight. It was a sandy stretch of broom and gorse and heather, with a few Scotch firs; it had no value at all, and he longed for it, as a boy might long for the bite someone else had {{snatched}} out of his apple. It distressed him lying there, his and yet not his, like a wife who was no wife--as though Fortune were enjoying her at his expense. Thus was he deprived of the fulness of his mental image; for as with all men, so with the Squire, that which he loved and owned took definite form--a some thing that he saw. Whenever the words [...] "Worsted Skeynes" [...] were in his mind--and that was almost always--there rose before him an image defined and concrete, however indescribable; and what ever this image was, he knew that Worsted Scotton spoiled it. It was true that he could not think of any use to which to put the Common, but he felt deeply that it was pure dog-in-the-mangerism of the cottagers, and this he could not stand. Not one beast in two years had fattened on its barrenness. Three old donkeys alone eked out the remnants of their days. A bundle of firewood or old bracken, a few peat sods from one especial corner, were all the selfish peasants gathered. But the cottagers were no great matter--he could soon have settled them; it was that fellow Peacock whom <b>he</b> could <b>not</b> settle, <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> happened to abut on the Common, and his fathers had been nasty before him. Mr. Pendyce rode round looking at the fence his father had put up, until he came to the portion that Peacock's father had pulled down; and here, by a strange fatality--such as will happen even in printed records--he came on Peacock himself standing in the gap, as though he had foreseen this visit of the Squire's. The mare stopped of her own accord, the spaniel John at a measured distance lay down to think, and all those yards away he could be heard doing it, and now and then swallowing his tongue.|$|R

True, Schemmer had testified that, attracted by the sound of quarrelling as he chanced to pass by, he had stood for at least five minutes outside; that then, when he entered, he found the prisoners already inside; and that they had <b>not</b> entered <b>just</b> before, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had been standing by the one door to the barracks. But what of that? Ah Cho and his four fellow-prisoners had testified that Schemmer was mistaken. In the end they would be let go. They were all confident of that. Five men could not have their heads cut off for two stab wounds. Besides, no foreign devil had seen the killing. But these Frenchmen were so stupid. In China, as Ah Cho well knew, the magistrate would order all of them to the torture and learn the truth. The truth was very easy to learn under torture. But these Frenchmen did not torture--bigger fools they! Therefore they would never find out who killed Chung Ga.|$|R

50|$|Bratyajon, a Bengali group theatre, is {{the brainchild}} of ace playwright and actor-director Bratya Basu. He has formed and steered the group from 2008. The {{productions}} under the banner of Bratyajon have been influenced by the learning, motivation, inspiration and experiences of the renowned playwright and theatre artist himself. Some of the important productions of Bratyajon are Ruddhasangeet (2009), Canvasser (2011), Byomkesh (2011), Cinemar Moto (2013), Ke?(2014), Boma (2015). Apart from theatrical production, the group is active in many associated fields. Ruddhasangeet was performed on stage a record 150th time at the Academy of Fine arts in front of a packed house on 6 February 2017. With his rich experience of directing plays, Bratya Basu, has led from the front to stage theatres in urban areas and at different metro cities in India and different parts of other countries throughout the year. For Bratya Basu, theatre is an exciting medium which requires its participants to be passionate about it. One should <b>not</b> do theatre <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has nothing else to do. It is the drive within, an extremely enthusiastic attitude which can {{bring out the best in}} a theatre worker. Basu respects those who carry this zeal and are open to experimenting with this medium. He has continued to encourage young theatre enthusiasts <b>not</b> <b>just</b> by giving them opportunities in his group at different levels, but also by thinking substantially for them in terms of their economic sustainability. For him, theatre is still a marginalized arena, where artists continue to struggle to earn a respectable living, His aim is to work actively and end this limitation of theatre by all means.|$|R

The revelation was shown to {{have a negative effect}} on the Wicks family, in particular Deano who was involved in a car accident shortly afterwards and was hospitalised after driving recklessly. The storyline progressed further, when it transpired that Shirley was hiding a secret for Kevin, that he was not the biological father of Deano or Carly.

Angel morphs into vamp face and the crowd chants, “Killing blow!” Angel defends himself from a few more hits, then stabs Baker in the chest with the knife. Once Baker is dead, the announcer says that Angel has made his first career kill. Angel heads back to join the other demons as Jack announces that it’s time for a match between Trepkos and (expected loser) Mellish. Angel tells Trepkos that if he and Mellish don’t fight, neither of them will die. Cribb tells Angel that <b>he’s</b> <b>not</b> an expert <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>he’s</b> made one kill; Angel replies that that wasn’t his first kill.
