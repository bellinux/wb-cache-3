40|$|We {{construct}} firm-level {{estimates for}} the cash flow sensitivity of cash (CCFS) by modeling heterogeneous slopes in a reduced-form cash equation augmented with cash flow. This approach enables us to identify firms that display a high propensity to save cash from cash flows versus firms that display a low or even <b>negative</b> <b>saving</b> propensity. Then we analyze which firm characteristics {{are associated with the}} magnitude of CCFS. We find that high CCFS-firms have higher variation and lower serial correlation in income suggesting that higher income shocks trigger buffering of cash. However, high CCFS-firms do not appear to suffer more from financing frictions measured by their debt-capacity, external finance dependence, interest payments or traditional indicators such as profitability-rates, liquidity-rates and dividend-policy. Overall, the results suggest that changes in cash are used for smoothing of uncertain income fluctuations but do not indicate a higher exposure to financing constraints. nrpages: 30 status: publishe...|$|E

Using panel data from a recent World Bank data set, we then find that the longevity effect is positive and the dependency effect is negative in savings and investment regressions. The estimates indicate that the differences in the demographic variables across countries or over time can well explain the differences in aggregate savings rates.

The present paper shows that when consumers are free to adopt real-time prices, and half the consumer population is pro-real-time prices (i. e. have zero or <b>negative</b> <b>saving</b> costs), producers do not offer sufficient incentives in return for efficient usage of electricity. They instead prefer to charge inefficient prices and discriminate against the portion of the consumer population who has no saving costs. We also find that efficient marginal cost pricing, although feasible, is not compatible with adoption of real-time prices by all consumers. Overall, our results cast some doubt about the allocative efficiency of real-time pricing, whether it is compulsory or not...|$|E
40|$|After {{two decades}} of tax {{neutrality}} for private saving, New Zealand policy changed radically with the recent introduction of tax incentives for KiwiSaver. A key issue for tax-favoured saving schemes {{is the extent to}} which existing saving is reshuffled versus new saving created by reduced consumption. Using data from a nationwide survey carried out by the authors, we estimate that each dollar of KiwiSaver balances represents only $ 0. 09 -$ 0. 19 of new saving. The rest is either reshuffling amongst existing saving and debt by KiwiSaver members, or else taxpayer and employer transfers which reduce national saving elsewhere. Homeowners are least likely to fund their KiwiSaver contributions by reducing spending, indicating possible mis-targeting since owners are often blamed for excessive consumption arising from house price wealth effects. There is little evidence that KiwiSaver affects either the reported trend in saving or the presence of dis-saving. Since only one-tenth of households report <b>negative</b> <b>saving,</b> KiwiSaver may be a costly and ineffective solution to a relatively small problem of insufficient household saving.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how families adjust their private old-age savings {{in response to}} a change in individual pension wealth. The regression discontinuity approach exploits two expansions of the child care pension benefit, in 1992 and in 1999, as natural experiments. The empirical analysis is based on three waves of the Survey of Income and Expenditure (EVS) : 1998, 2003 and 2008. All results indicate that families do not adjust their private old-age savings in response to the increase in their pension wealth. From a political point of view, this suggests that the increase in individual pension wealth does not crowd-out old-age private savings.

40|$|As {{significant}} part of national wealth, households' wealth is the central issue in both policy debate and academic literature. Nevertheless, in Hungary little effort has been made so far to conduct thorough evaluation of households' wealth for the last decade.

Doing so, as a by-product, we also display the estimated wealth levels of households. Based on international comparison and econometric techniques, it is confirmed that the recent financial wealth level of Hungarian households is still relatively low, meanwhile the current housing wealth is not evidently below the equilibrium level. These results provide an explanation why governmental housing subsidy scheme has its major effect on house prices rather than housing stock.

40|$|We analyze households’ {{economic}} freedom {{to determine their}} standard of living, characterized by their capacity to spend on housing, utilities, food, and transport: economic poverty {{is a lack of}} freedom due to budgetary constraints. We propose three new measures. The first is the classical notion of “freedom to choose”, distinguishing however between the categories of high, medium and low frequency of purchase. Facing a food price increase, households in the lowest decile cannot escape it: they are not free. For the lowest decile the share of high-frequency consumption goods is 60 %. We show that the households in the 1 ° decile of consumption recorded an inflation rate which, between 1999 and 2009, was 7 percentage points higher than the inflation rate for the 10 ° decile. The second {{is a measure of the}} freedom to choose an adequate food plan: the share of households unable to ensure adequate food consumption, according to our measure, was 6. 3 % in 2007, increasing to 8. 4 % in 2009. We show that food consumption, inside and outside the home, is constrained by housing costs. The level of food consumption for households below the food poverty line is startlingly low for families with children, and constraints on food consumption in the north are slightly higher than in the south of Italy. The third measure is defined with reference to a “negative saving” of necessities, i. e. a level of income lower than that required to ensure an adequate consumption of non-durable goods and services. The share of households which experienced financial difficulties in 2008, at the onset of the crisis, was 13. 7 %. The households with negative savings are typically those having one earner, working class, young and living in rented housing; this group tended to increase between 1998 and 2008. While the level of food and clothing consumption is almost equal in the north and the south of Italy, the degree of economic vulnerability is higher in the south when considering income and savings. freedom, poverty, <b>negative</b> <b>saving,</b> consumption distribution, food, purchase frequency...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain why a low and declining saving rate should be a problem in a world of free capital flows and {{increasing}} wealth. In Italy consumer households’ saving have been the main driver of economic stability and growth, funding investments and public debt, and despite international turbulences Italy was acknowledged as a high saving country until the early 1990 ’s. Ever since, however, households saving rate plunged, in spite of an increasing financial wealth, and our aim is to explain why: we suggest two main causes. The first is related to the economic policies implemented to deal with four major economic events, prompted by economic misalignments: a) the 1992 ’s currency crisis, b) the run-up to the Euro, c) the 2006 ’ turning point, preceding the 2008 ’s crisis, and d) the 2009 ’s public debt crisis and the following policy of fiscal consolidation. These four events were dealt with economic policies which overlooked the huge income and saving shifts from households to government and private sectors: rising tax burden, especially indirect taxes, freezing of nominal public expenditures and falling real wages were the main policy instruments, while a decreasing households’ income and saving was a primary consequences. Households have been struggling to smooth their standard of life drawing on their saving and wealth, but the effort became all the more difficult as the saving rate was falling below a critical level, increasing the probability of <b>negative</b> <b>saving</b> and debt. Gross national saving turned less than aggregate investment, prompting an increasing borrowing from abroad and a corresponding negative current account. The second cause is structural and covers two crucial issues: the first is the deep economy impacts of a changing age structure, as a consequence of a sudden fertility drop. The second issue is related to the falling households size composition jointly with the rising share of quasi-fixed costs necessary for a decent life. We show how and why a well designed Welfare State could help to restore income stability and saving, tackling the widespread problem of changing age structure in most countries...|$|E

It aims to present more recent water footprint accounting on annual crops in this study. Due to the large scale water footprint accounting (country level), the calculation for grey water footprint was omitted from this study. The green and blue water footprints of barley, maize, oilseed rape, soybeans and wheat for Iran and barley, oats, oilseed rape, and wheat for Finland were calculated over the annual growing period 2007 to 2012. Crops were selected upon the availability of crop production in each country. WF values were estimated based on crop water use (CWU) and crop yield, where CWU was estimated upon the accumulative ET over the growing season of the crops. For daily evapotranspiration values AQUACROP model was used. For running the AQUACROP model, different parameters were needed such as climatic parameters (including minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall and potential evapotranspiration), soil type, land management, irrigation practice, groundwater and initial condition for sowing, sowing and harvesting dates. This data were mined from databases. Due {{to the fact that}} crop production in Finland is rain-fed, only green WF of the selected crops were calculated for Finland. In Finland oilseed rape had the highest average green water footprint per ton of production, which was 2471 m^ 3 t¯¹yr¯^ 1 and it was followed by oats (1036 m^ 3 t¯¹yr¯^ 1), wheat (944 ? m?^ 3 t¯¹yr¯^ 1), and barley (838 ? m?^ 3 t¯¹yr¯^ 1). Considering the annual crop production, the average total green water footprint of selected crops was 3669 Mm^ 3 yr¯^ 1 in Finland. Water saving through crop trade was estimated - 294 Mm^ 3 yr¯^ 1. The <b>negative</b> <b>saving</b> water amount showed the virtual water loss through crop trade of selected crops in Finland. The highest export crop in Finland was oats during 2007 ? 2012. In Iran the major share of annual crop production comes from irrigated crop lands and that shows the importance of blue water footprint accounting beside green water footprint. The sum of green and blue water footprints of the growing crops in Iran was considered as water footprint of the crops. Water footprint per ton of crops in Iran increased from maize (696 m^ 3 t¯¹yr¯^ 1), wheat (1235 m^ 3 t¯¹yr¯^ 1), barley (1350 m^ 3 t¯¹yr¯^ 1), soybeans (2210 m^ 3 t¯¹yr¯^ 1) to oilseed rape (3503 m^ 3 t¯¹yr¯^ 1). Total average water footprint of the selected crops in Iran considering their production in the country was estimated 22816 ? Mm?^ 3 yr¯^ 1. Regarding the crop trade balances in Iran, the country saved 8902 ? Mm?^ 3 yr¯^ 1 water by importing the crops. Wheat was the major import crop during 2007 ? 2012. WF can be a strong tool for assessing the consumptive water use of the agricultural systems in place and time according to different agricultural and water managements. It can bring a ground for comparing the production sites for certain crops or products considering the lower WF of the produced items.

This paper discusses the impact of policy uncertainty on private savings. The author uses the Ordinal Certainty Equivalence approach to establish that trade policy uncertainty by itself will further reduce savings if: (a) there is a positive risk aversion; and (b) the intertemporal substitution elasticity exceeds 1. The result shows that, with positive risk aversion, policy uncertainty will in fact reinforce the <b>negative</b> <b>savings</b> impact of an anticipated policy reversal, especially when that negative impact is strong. This suggests that with high risk aversion and high intertemporal substitution, a rapid trade reform that is not fully credible may depress private savings significantly, with attendant negative impact on the current account.
