5000|$|Reinhold Rudenberg (or Rüdenberg; February 4, 1883 - December 25, 1961) was a German-American {{electrical}} engineer and inventor, credited with many innovations {{in the electric}} power and related fields. Aside from improvements in electric power equipment, especially large alternating current generators, among others were the electrostatic-lens electron microscope, carrier-current communications on power lines, a form of phased array radar, an explanation of power blackouts, <b>preferred</b> <b>number</b> <b>series,</b> and the number prefix [...] "Giga-".|$|R
50|$|In {{industrial}} design, <b>preferred</b> <b>numbers</b> (also called <b>preferred</b> values, <b>preferred</b> <b>series</b> or convenient <b>numbers)</b> {{are standard}} guidelines for choosing exact product dimensions {{within a given}} set of constraints. Product developers must choose numerous lengths, distances, diameters, volumes, and other characteristic quantities. While all of these choices are constrained by considerations of functionality, usability, compatibility, safety or cost, there usually remains considerable leeway in the exact choice for many dimensions.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} sustain a fission chain reaction, the {{neutrons}} released in fission events have to react with other atoms in the fuel.

The court transcript reveals Atkinson had to borrow a mobile phone to call police from the Winchelsea police station, which was closed for the night. This backs up the evidence given originally at the committal hearing that no mobile phone was available.|$|R

50|$|A similar tabular layout is {{presented}} by Kleene. The main {{difference is that}} Kleene does not abbreviate the left-hand sides of assertions to line <b>numbers,</b> <b>preferring</b> instead to either give full lists of precedent propositions or alternatively indicate the left-hand sides by bars running down {{the left of the}} table to indicate dependencies. However, Kleene's version has the advantage that it {{is presented}}, although only very sketchily, within a rigorous framework of metamathematical theory, whereas the books by Suppes and Lemmon are applications of the tabular layout for teaching introductory logic.|$|R

50|$|Renard {{series are}} {{a system of}} <b>preferred</b> <b>numbers</b> {{dividing}} an interval from 1 to 10 into 5, 10, 20, or 40 steps. This set of <b>preferred</b> <b>numbers</b> was proposed in the 1870s by French army engineer Colonel Charles Renard. His system was adopted in 1952 as international standard ISO 3. Renard's system of <b>preferred</b> <b>numbers</b> divides the interval from 1 to 10 into 5, 10, 20, or 40 steps. The factor between two consecutive numbers in a Renard series is approximately constant (before rounding), namely the 5th, 10th, 20th, or 40th root of 10 (approximately 1.58, 1.26, 1.12, and 1.06, respectively), {{which leads to a}} geometric sequence. This way, the maximum relative error is minimized if an arbitrary number is replaced by the nearest Renard number multiplied by the appropriate power of 10. One application of the Renard series of numbers is to current rating of electric fuses.|$|R
