5|$|One {{attempt at}} relief was thwarted {{early in the}} siege when a force of New York militia under Nicholas Herkimer was stopped in the August 6 Battle of Oriskany by a {{detachment}} of St. Leger's forces. While that battle did not involve the fort's garrison, some of its occupants sortied and raided the <b>nearly</b> <b>empty</b> Indian and Loyalist camps, which was {{a blow to the}} morale of St. Leger's Indian support. They killed some Seneca. The siege was finally broken when American reinforcements under the command of Benedict Arnold neared, and Arnold used a ruse, with the assistance of Herkimer's relative Hon Yost Schuyler, to convince the besiegers that a much larger force was arriving. This misinformation, combined with the departure of Indian fighters not interested in siege warfare and upset over their losses from the raids, led St. Leger to abandon the effort and retreat.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February 1943, Yamato was {{replaced}} by her sister ship Musashi as flagship of the Combined Fleet. The battleship spent only a single day away from Truk between her arrival in August 1942 and her departure on 8 May 1943. On that day, she set sail for Yokosuka and from there for Kure, arriving on 14 May. She spent nine days in dry dock for inspection and general repairs, and after sailing to Japan's western Inland Sea she was again dry-docked in late July for significant refitting and upgrades. On 16 August, Yamato began her return to Truk, where she joined a large task force formed in response to American raids on the Tarawa and Makin atolls. She sortied in late September with Nagato, three carriers, and smaller warships to intercept US Task Force 15, and again a month later with six battleships, three carriers, and eleven cruisers. Intelligence had reported that the United States Naval Base at Pearl Harbor was <b>nearly</b> <b>empty</b> of ships, which the Japanese interpreted to mean that an American naval force would strike at Wake Island. But there were no radar contacts for six days, and the fleet returned to Truk, arriving on 26 October.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May, Prinz Eugen rendezvoused {{with the}} supply ship Spichern to refill her <b>nearly</b> <b>empty</b> fuel tanks. She had by then only some 160 tons fuel left, {{enough for a}} day. Afterwards the ship {{continued}} further south on a mission against shipping lines. However, before any merchant ship was found, defects in her engines showed and on 27 May, the day Bismarck herself was sunk, she was ordered {{to give up her}} mission and make for a port in occupied France. On 28 May Prinz Eugen refuelled from the tanker Esso Hamburg. The same day more engine problems showed up, including trouble with the port engine turbine, the cooling of the middle engine and problems with the starboard screw, reducing her speed to maximum 28 knots. The screw problems could only be checked and repaired in a dock and thus Brest, with its large docks and repair facilities, was chosen as destination. Despite the many British warships and several convoys in the area, at least 104 units were identified on the 29th by the ship's radio crew, Prinz Eugen reached the Bay of Biscay undiscovered, and on 1 June the ship was joined by German destroyers and aircraft off the coast of France south of Brest; and escorted to Brest, which she reached late on 1 June where she immediately entered dock.|$|E

60|$|It used {{at first}} {{to be quite a}} matter of {{difficulty}} {{to know what to do}} with the frogs after they were caught; but after a time a covered basket was kept outside the door, and into this the frogs were popped, and taken once a day and emptied into the stream. At first they had got into the well, and had proved a great nuisance; and they were only got rid of by <b>nearly</b> <b>emptying</b> the well out with buckets, and by then building a wall round its mouth, with a tightly-fitting lid.|$|R

25|$|Scheduled {{mass transit}} (i.e. buses or trains) trades off service {{frequency}} and load factor. Buses and trains must {{run on a}} predefined schedule, even during off-peak times when demand is low and vehicles are <b>nearly</b> <b>empty.</b> So to increase load factor, transportation planners try to predict times of low demand, and run reduced schedules or smaller vehicles at these times. This increases passengers' wait times. In many cities, trains and buses do not run at all at night or on weekends.|$|E

5000|$|During {{a series}} between the Braves and the San Diego Padres, one game spawned several brawls {{between the two}} teams.

When Pérez was finally hit, by a pitch thrown by the Padres' Craig Lefferts, {{the first of many}} bench-clearing brawls began. By the time the game was over, both teams' lineups had been <b>nearly</b> <b>emptied</b> (due to all the ejections on both sides).|$|R
5000|$|Two main {{theories}} have been postulated {{as to how}} gas could have leaked. Dr. Eckener believed a snapped bracing wire had torn a gas cell open (see below), while others suggest that a maneuvering or automatic gas valve was stuck open and gas from cell 4 leaked through. During the airship's first flight to Rio, a gas cell was <b>nearly</b> <b>emptied</b> when an automatic valve was stuck open, and gas had to be transferred from other cells to maintain an even keel. However, no other valve failures were reported during the ship's flight history, and on the final approach {{there was no indication}} in instruments that a valve had stuck open.|$|R
40|$|This {{characterization}} report {{summarizes the}} available {{information on the}} historical uses, current status, and sampling and analysis results of waste stored in double-shell underground storage tank 241 - AN- 102. This report supports {{the requirements of the}} Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order, Milestone M- 44 - 09 (Ecology et al. 1996). Tank 241 -AN- 102 is one of seven double-shell tanks located in the AN Tank Farm in the Hanford Site 200 East Area. The tank was hydrotested in 1981, and when the water was removed, a 6 -inch heel was left. Tank 241 -AN- 102 began receiving waste from tank 241 -SY- 102 beginning in 1982. The tank was <b>nearly</b> <b>emptied</b> {{in the third quarter of}} 1983, leaving only 125 kL (33 kgal) of waste. Between the fourth quarter of 1983 and the first quarter of 1984, tank 241 -AN- 102 received waste from tanks 241 -AY- 102, 241 -SY- 102, 241 -AW- 105, and 241 - AN- 101. The tank was <b>nearly</b> <b>emptied</b> in the second quarter of 1984, leaving a heel of 129 kL (34 kgal). During the second and third quarters of 1984, the tank was filled with concentrated complexant waste from tank 241 -AW- 101. Since that time, only minor amounts of Plutonium-Uranium Extraction (PUREX) Plant miscellaneous waste and water have been received; there have been no waste transfer to or from the tank since 1992. Therefore, the waste currently in the tank is considered to be concentrated complexant waste. Tank 241 -AN- 102 is sound and is not included on any of the Watch Lists...|$|R
25|$|While it is {{possible}} to calculate the required ballast given the diver and all his or her equipment, this is not done in practice, as all the values would have to be measured accurately. The practical procedure is known as a buoyancy check, and is done by wearing all the equipment, with the tank(s) <b>nearly</b> <b>empty,</b> and the buoyancy compensator empty, in shallow water, and adding or removing weight until the diver is neutrally buoyant. The weight should then be distributed on the diver to provide correct trim, and a sufficient part of the weight should be carried {{in such a way that}} it can be removed quickly in an emergency to provide positive buoyancy at any point in the dive. This is not always possible, and in those cases an alternative method of providing positive buoyancy should be used.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the middle}} period works extend the musical {{language}} Beethoven had inherited from Haydn and Mozart. The middle period work includes the Third through Eighth Symphonies, the Rasumovsky, Harp and Serioso string quartets, the Waldstein and Appassionata piano sonatas, Christ on the Mount of Olives, the opera Fidelio, the Violin Concerto and many other compositions. During this time Beethoven's income came from publishing his works, from performances of them, and from his patrons. His position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and {{he was forced to}} move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on Fidelio, his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian censor, and finally premiered in November 1805 to houses that were <b>nearly</b> <b>empty</b> because of the French occupation of the city. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of Fidelio was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.|$|E
25|$|The steamer Gordon was {{suggested}} as an alternative. She had a shallow enough draught {{to use the}} back channels and could make over 12 knots, {{more than enough to}} elude Union pursuit. Gordon was offered to the Confederate government either as a purchase for $62,000 or as a charter for $10,000. The Confederate Treasury could not afford this, but a local cotton broker, George Trenholm, paid the $10,000 in return for half the cargo space on the return trip. Renamed Theodora, the ship left Charleston at 1 a.m. on October 12, and successfully evaded Union ships enforcing the blockade. On October 14, she arrived at Nassau in the Bahamas, but had missed connections with a British steamer going to St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies, the main point of departure for British ships from the Caribbean to Britain. However, they discovered that British mail ships might be anchored in Spanish Cuba, and Theodora turned southwest towards Cuba. Theodora appeared off the coast of Cuba on October 15, with her coal bunkers <b>nearly</b> <b>empty.</b> An approaching Spanish warship hailed Theodora. Slidell and George Eustis, Jr. went aboard, and were informed that British mail packets did indeed dock at the port of Havana, but that the last one had just left, and that the next one, the paddle steamer RMS Trent, would arrive in three weeks. Theodora docked in Cárdenas, Cuba on October 16, and Mason and Slidell disembarked. The two diplomats decided to stay in Cardenas before making an overland trek to Havana to catch the next British ship.|$|E
