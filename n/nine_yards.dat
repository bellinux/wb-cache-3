5|$|The kickoff was fielded {{near the}} Florida State six-yard line and {{returned}} 16 {{yards to the}} State 22-yard line. The first {{play of the game}} was a long pass by quarterback Chris Rix, but the throw was not caught. On the second play, Rix was sacked for a loss of <b>nine</b> <b>yards.</b> A third-down pass was incomplete, and Florida State punted. Virginia Tech returned the kick into Florida State territory, and the Hokies' offense began Tech's first possession of the game at the State 48-yard line. The Hokies' first play was an 18-yard pass from quarterback Grant Noel to tight end Bob Slowikowski, long enough for a first down at the Florida State 29-yard line. From there, running back Kevin Jones gained 12 yards and a first down on a run up the middle of the field. Jones gained three yards on the next play, then Noel was sacked by the Seminoles for a loss of <b>nine</b> <b>yards.</b> On third down, Jones regained some of the lost yardage but was unable to pick up a first down. Facing fourth down, Tech sent in kicker Carter Warley to attempt a 36-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and with 10:56 remaining in the first quarter, Virginia Tech took a 30 lead.|$|E
5|$|The post-score kickoff {{rolled into}} the end zone for a touchback, and Virginia Tech began at its 20-yard line. On the first play, Nebraska {{committed}} a five-yard offsides penalty. Shyrone Stith and Parker then ran for a combined six yards on the next two plays, picking up a first down with the shortened yardage provided by the penalty. From the first down at the Tech 31-yard line, Druckenmiller threw three consecutive passes: The first was incomplete, the second gained one yard, and the third gained <b>nine</b> <b>yards</b> and a first down. After that gain, however, Tech lost yardage on a rush by Oxendine, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass, then was sacked for a loss of <b>nine</b> <b>yards</b> during the third down play. Kibble punted, and Nebraska began at the Tech 45-yard line after the kick was returned 26 yards by Michael Hawkes. The Cornhuskers took quick advantage of the good field position. Ahman Green ran 17 yards for a first down, then Frost passed for 23 yards to Kenny Cheatham, pushing Nebraska inside the Virginia Tech red zone. On just the third play after Virginia Tech's punt, Frost ran the remaining five yards, crossing the goal line for a touchdown. The extra point was good, and with 9:14 remaining, Nebraska took a 107 lead.|$|E

5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 14-yard line, where the Yellow Jackets began their game-winning drive. The offense began slowly; Georgia Tech gained only <b>nine</b> <b>yards</b> in three plays, setting up a crucial fourth-down conversion. A failed try would give Clemson the ball deep in Georgia Tech territory, with little time remaining in the game for Georgia Tech to reply to any score. Instead, the Yellow Jackets converted the fourth down, keeping their drive alive. On the first play after the fourth-down conversion, Nesbitt completed a 21-yard pass to Dwyer, pushing Tech to near midfield. Eight plays later, Dwyer breached the Clemson defense for a 15-yard gain and the go-ahead score. A false start penalty on Georgia Tech's two-point conversion try prevented any extra points, but the touchdown's six points were enough to give Georgia Tech a 39–34 lead.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's post-score kickoff {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense began its first drive of the quarter from its 20-yard line. Tech's first play of the quarter was a 15-yard {{completed}} pass by Noel for a first down. That was followed by an 11-yard run by Jones for another first down. After an incomplete pass, Noel ran for a first down at the State 41-yard line. Inside Florida State territory, gaining ground became much more difficult. The next three plays netted Tech only <b>nine</b> <b>yards,</b> setting up a critical fourth-and-one play. With Virginia Tech outside field goal range and trailing, the Hokies needed another first down to move within potential scoring range. But on fourth down, Jones was stopped for no gain on a running play, and the Hokies turned the ball over on downs. The play later was cited as the game's turning point.|$|E
5|$|Following Tennessee's touchdown, the {{two teams}} traded possessions, each going three and out. Virginia Tech regained the ball after a Tennessee punt to its 20-yard line with 7:31 {{remaining}} in the quarter. After a Tech fumble that was recovered by the Hokies, Tech running back Dwayne Thomas ran <b>nine</b> <b>yards</b> for the first Tech first down of the game. After an incomplete pass, DeShazo and Thomas connected on an eight-yard pass before Thomas broke free for an 11-yard run and another first down. Thomas continued advancing the ball, picking up eight yards on two rushing plays. DeShazo then completed a four-yard pass for a first down at the Tennessee 39-yard line. There, however, Tennessee's defense stiffened and did not allow the Hokies another first down. The Tech punt was downed at the Tennessee 7-yard line, where the Volunteers began their third possession of the game.|$|E

50|$|The 2014 Texas Bowl was {{dominated}} by Arkansas from beginning to end. The Razorbacks opened the scoring with an Adam McFain field goal in the first quarter, to give Arkansas a 3-0 lead. The second quarter proved to be very productive for the Razorback offense, as quarterback Brandon Allen threw touchdowns passes to Demetrius Wilson and Keon Hatcher. The Arkansas defense got in on the second quarter scoring as well, as defensive lineman Taiwan Johnson recovered a Longhorn fumble {{in the end zone}} for a Razorback touchdown. Texas put together their only scoring drive in the second period, when Longhorn quarterback Tyrone Swoopes scored on a <b>nine</b> <b>yard</b> run around the left end. The Hogs lead 24-7 at the half.|$|R
5|$|In {{possession}} of the ball and a large lead, Virginia Tech proceeded to start running out the clock by executing running plays, which do not halt the game clock at their conclusion as do incomplete passing plays. Suggs gained <b>nine</b> <b>yards</b> on a run up the middle, then Ferguson was tackled for a loss after an incomplete pass by Vick. Tech punted, and the ball was downed at the 26-yard line. Following the punt, Clemson put backup quarterback Willie Simmons into the game. On his first play, Simmons was sacked by Jim Davis for a five-yard loss. The second play was {{a repeat of the}} first, as Davis again sacked Simmons, this time for an 11-yard loss. On third down, Simmons threw an incomplete pass, and Clemson punted after going three and out.|$|E

From midfield, Keldorf attempted a deep pass on first down, but the ball fell incomplete. On second down, Keldorf completed a four-yard pass to Linton but was sacked on third down by the Virginia Tech defense. The sack forced Carolina to punt {{for the second time}} in the game, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Michigan won {{the coin}} toss and elected {{to defer to}} the second half, and Alabama opened play with a three-and-out. Michigan was then held to only one first down before they punted on their first possession. On the drive that ensued, Alabama's mix of play-action passes and rushes ended with a two-yard {{touchdown}} reception by Michael Williams from AJ McCarron for a 7–0 lead. After the Crimson Tide defense again forced a Wolverine punt, on Alabama's next drive, McCarron connected with DeAndrew White for a 51-yard touchdown reception and a 14–0 lead. Michigan stalled on their next drive after Denard Robinson threw an interception to Dee Milliner who returned it to Michigan's 17-yard line.

5|$|Tech {{returned}} Indiana's post-score kickoff to the 22-yard line, {{where the}} Hokie offense returned to action. Tech picked up <b>nine</b> <b>yards</b> on a pass from DeShazo, but two plays later, DeShazo threw his first interception {{of the game}} as Indiana's Mose Richardson jumped {{in front of a}} Tech pass. Following the turnover, Indiana's offense began work from the Virginia Tech 31-yard line. The Hoosiers picked up a first down rushing the ball, but a holding call on first down pushed Indiana away from the end zone. Following the penalty, Virginia Tech's defense prevented the Hoosiers gaining another first down, and IU was forced to attempt another field goal. As before, Manopolous' kick—this one a 40-yard attempt—was good, and Indiana sliced Tech's lead to a single point, 1413, with 5:25 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Alabama 16-yard line by Milons. The first play of the drive was a 12-yard run by Alexander, who also gained a first down.
