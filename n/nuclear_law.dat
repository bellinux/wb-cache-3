5000|$|Before {{attempting}} {{to identify which}} special aspects of <b>nuclear</b> <b>law</b> distinguish it from other types of law, {{it is important to}} highlight briefly the fundamental reason why a State would decide to make the major effort necessary in order to promulgate such legislation.

[...] The short answer here is that these other state laws are not before the Court, and indeed, Proposition 15 was not passed; these provisions and their pedigree do not taint {{other parts of the}} Warren-Alquist Act.|$|R

This makes it worthy of special consideration and treatment, always remembering that it is just one tiny segment of the law in general.|$|E

However, liability concerns {{and a few}} other issues are preventing further progress on the issue. Experts say that India's <b>nuclear</b> liability <b>law</b> discourages foreign <b>nuclear</b> companies. This <b>law</b> gives accident victims the right to seek damages from plant suppliers {{in the event of a}} mishap. It has [...] "deterred foreign players like General Electric and Westinghouse Electric, a US-based unit of Toshiba, with companies asking for further clarification on compensation liability for private operators".|$|R

40|$|The current U. S. {{system of}} <b>nuclear</b> waste <b>law</b> and policy is bankrupt. Twenty {{years after the}} {{designation}} by Congress of Yucca Mountain as the only potential site for a deep geologic repository to receive spent nuclear fuel and high level waste from reprocessing, the proposed Yucca repository remains mired in controversy and unremitting opposition by Nevada. There is no prospect for an alternative repository or {{for the development of}} a federal consolidated storage facility. The volume of these wastes already exceeds the current maximum storage capacity set by Congress for Yucca and continues to grow. This article first provides a brief overview of nuclear wastes and a summary history of federal <b>nuclear</b> waste <b>law</b> and policy to date. It then diagnoses the major failures in the current design and proposes a suite of new measures to launch a comprehensive new approach, including a reconsideration of the ethical principles underlying the drive for immediate waste burial; the creation of a high-level National Waste Management Commission; the creation of two new federal entities to manage nuclear wastes and to site waste storage facilities and repositories; the elimination of Environmental Protection Agency regulatory authority over these activities; the adoption of a thoroughgoing risk-based approach to waste regulation and management; and the adoption of new, more flexible and adaptable strategies for siting storage and disposal facilities...|$|R
