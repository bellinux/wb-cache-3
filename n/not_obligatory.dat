5|$|Stephen {{also found}} fault with Symeon for revering his spiritual father, Symeon the Studite. At that time, formal {{recognition}} of saints was seldom practiced and <b>not</b> <b>obligatory,</b> so revered monks were informally recognized and honored by monasteries {{and by their}} disciples. Every year the younger Symeon arranged a celebration honoring his teacher, which included an icon of Symeon the Studite and a service to him. Stephen rebuked Symeon for honoring his teacher as a saint, because in his opinion the Studite was not worth of any honor. The conflict between the two lasted for six years.|$|E

25|$|Number — The plural verbal suffix, -pha (just as {{the nominal}} one,-naka) is optional. Thus, while pluralization is very productive, it is <b>not</b> <b>obligatory.</b>|$|E
25|$|Valency-{{increasing}} — The five valency increasing suffixes {{may occur}} {{on a wide}} range of verbs but are <b>not</b> <b>obligatory.</b> The meaning expressed when a word receives one of these suffixes is predictable.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of their}} members (or sub-groups, {{especially}} those belonging to Qizilbash and Hurufism) claim that God takes abode in {{the bodies of the}} human-beings (ḥulūl), believe in metempsychosis (tanāsukh), and consider Islamic law to be <b>not</b> <b>obligatory</b> (ibāḥa), similar to antinomianism.|$|E

50|$|In fact, since 1970, the Roman Missal's list of vestments {{to be used}} at Mass {{makes no}} mention of the maniple, {{although}} it does speak of another vestment, the amice, whose use is <b>not</b> always <b>obligatory.</b>|$|R

25|$|Maliki: In the Maliki madhhab, {{the face}} and {{the hands of a}} woman are not awrah; {{therefore}} covering the face is <b>not</b> <b>obligatory.</b> However, Maliki scholars have stated that it is highly recommended (mustahabb) for women to cover their faces.|$|E
25|$|Direction {{of motion}} — Although these suffixes are quite productive, they are <b>not</b> <b>obligatory.</b> The {{meaning of a}} word which is affixed {{with a member of}} this {{category}} is often but not always predictable, and the word formed may have a different meaning than the root.|$|E
25|$|At private schools, kinders usually {{consist of}} three grades, {{and a fourth}} one may be added for nursery. The fourth one is called maternal. It goes before the other three years and is <b>not</b> <b>obligatory.</b> While the first grade is a playgroup, {{the other two are}} of {{classroom}} education.|$|E
50|$|Osborne (1974) {{identifies}} eleven grammatical {{categories that}} can be marked on verbs. They are listed below using his terminology. All verbs must be marked for tense, person and number, and third person-singular subjects and objects are also obligatorily marked for gender. All other categories listed below are <b>not</b> grammatically <b>obligatory.</b>|$|R

25|$|Techniques {{and ceremonies}} vary among {{cultures}}. Sleight-of-hand, ventriloquism {{might be used}} to impress the audience. In some cultures the angakkuq was pinioned before the séance, or the angakkuq might hide behind a curtain. Holding the séance in the dark with lamps extinguished was <b>not</b> <b>obligatory,</b> but the setting was familiar and widespread.|$|E
25|$|Multipliers/reversers — The two multipliers/reversers are {{comparatively}} less {{productive and}} are <b>not</b> <b>obligatory.</b> In some contexts, attachment to a verb conveys a reverser meaning and effectively express {{the opposite of}} the meaning of the plain root. In this respect, the multipliers/reversers are the most derivational-like of all the suffixes discussed so far.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{location}} — The nine spatial locations suffixes are likewise highly {{productive and}} <b>not</b> <b>obligatory.</b> Similarly, {{the meaning of}} the word that contains a member of this category is typically (but not consistently) predictable. There are also contexts in which the word formed has a meaning that significantly differs from that of the root to which it attaches.|$|E
30|$|The 3 -pillar {{categorization}} of The World Bank (1994) classifies pensions as obligatory public pensions, obligatory privately managed pensions, and voluntary privately managed pensions.

5000|$|Ordinary and {{extraordinary}} care are distinguished by some bioethical theories, including {{the teaching of}} the Catholic Church. Ordinary care is obligatory, but can become extraordinary care under certain situations. [...] Extraordinary care is care whose provision involves a disproportionately great burden on the patient or community, and hence is <b>not</b> morally <b>obligatory.</b>|$|R
25|$|Shafi'i: The Shafi'i {{school has}} had two {{well-known}} positions on this issue. The first view is that covering of the face is <b>not</b> <b>obligatory</b> (fard). The second view is that covering the face is obligatory only in times of fitnah (where men do not lower their gaze; or when a woman is very attractive).|$|E
25|$|More specifically, wudu is {{performed}} by Muslims by washing the hands, mouth, nose, arms, face, hair (often washing {{the hair is}} merely drawing the already wet hands from the fringe to the nape of the neck), ears, and feet three times each in that order.

25|$|The most {{commonly}} used method of calculation is that originally proposed by Linus Pauling. This gives a dimensionless quantity, {{commonly referred to as}} the Pauling scale (χr), on a relative scale running from around 0.7 to 3.98 (hydrogen= 2.20). When other methods of calculation are used, it is conventional (although <b>not</b> <b>obligatory)</b> to quote the results on a scale that covers the same range of numerical values: this is known as an electronegativity in Pauling units.|$|E

2500|$|Hanbali: According to the Hanbali school, {{there are}} two differing views on whether a woman's whole body is awrah or not. Mālik, Awzāʿī, and Shafiʿī suggest that the awrah of a woman is her entire body {{excluding}} her face and her hands. Hence, covering the face would <b>not</b> be <b>obligatory</b> (fard) in this madhhab.|$|R

25|$|Al-Qaradawi {{says that}} Niqab (Veil) is <b>not</b> <b>obligatory</b> in Islam. He {{has pointed out}} that a woman's face is not an Awrah. He calls those who don the Niqabs as {{following}} tradition and culture before Islam came to Arabia. Those people, be it male or female at that time had to cover their faces from dusty desert and from inhaling dust especially during sandstorm. Al-Azhar's Grand Imam, also an Egyptian Grand Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy have also called out that Niqab {{has nothing to do with}} Islam.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{artificial}} ice {{was at the}} time <b>not</b> <b>obligatory</b> for Olympic ice competitions. It had only been used once before, at the 1936 Winter Olympics. The city had several incentives for building an artificial rink. In addition to the post-Olympic value of having a quality venue, the committee would not have to designated an out-of-town reserve venue, should there be fair weather during the Olympics. Several locations were considered. The main Jordal proponent was Labor-politician Rolf Hofmo, who was instrumental in deciding on the location, which was at the site of a former brickyard, hence the dug-out hill location. This was also the location of Jordal Stadion, a local stadium built between 1930 and 1936.|$|E
25|$|Tamburs {{are made}} {{almost entirely of}} wood. The shell (Tekne) is {{assembled}} from strips of hardwood called ribs joined edge to edge to form a semi-spherical body for the instrument. The number of ribs traditionally amounts to 17, 21 or 23, yet examples with slightly wider and consequently fewer ribs (7, 9 or 11) {{can also be found}} among older specimens. Traditionally, thinner strips called fileto are inserted between the ribs for ornamental purposes, but are <b>not</b> <b>obligatory.</b> The most common tonewood veneers used for rib-making are mahogany, flame maple, Persian walnut, Mecca balsam wood (Commiphora gileadensis), Spanish chestnut, Greek juniper, mulberry, Oriental plane, Indian rosewood and apricot. Ribs are assembled on the bottom wedge (tail) and the heel on which the fingerboard is mounted.|$|E
25|$|The Three Oaths are an Aggadic Midrash, and {{therefore}} they are <b>not</b> Halakhically <b>obligatory</b> (Aggadic Midrashim, as opposed to Halachic Midrashim are not traditionally understood as a valid source for Halacha). Accordingly, Maimonides' Mishne Torah, the Arba'ah Turim, the Shulchan Aruch, and other halachic sources do not cite the Three Oaths or rule accordingly. They are not found there at all.|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of taurodontism in 31 patients with XXY Klinefelter's syndrome was studied. Taurodont molars {{were observed in}} 6 of the 31 cases (19. 4 %), a significantly higher rate than among the controls.
