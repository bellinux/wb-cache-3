5|$|In the United States, benzodiazepines are Schedule IV drugs {{under the}} Federal Controlled Substances Act, even when {{not on the}} market (for example, <b>nitrazepam</b> and bromazepam). Flunitrazepam is subject to more {{stringent}} regulations in certain states and temazepam prescriptions require specially coded pads in certain states.|$|E
5|$|Intermediate-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 12â€“40 hours. They {{may have some}} residual effects {{in the first half}} of the day if used as a hypnotic. Rebound insomnia, however, is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer-acting benzodiazepines. Examples are alprazolam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam, lormetazepam, lorazepam, <b>nitrazepam,</b> and temazepam.|$|E
5|$|The list of benzodiazepines {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of insomnia is fairly similar among most countries, but which benzodiazepines are officially designated as first-line hypnotics prescribed {{for the treatment of}} insomnia varies between countries. Longer-acting benzodiazepines such as <b>nitrazepam</b> and diazepam have residual effects that may persist into the next day and are, in general, not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, <b>nitrazepam,</b> flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam</b> {{is largely}} bound to plasma proteins. Benzodiazepines such as <b>nitrazepam</b> are lipid-soluble {{and have a}} high {{cerebral}} uptake. The time for <b>nitrazepam</b> to reach peak plasma concentrations following oral administration is about 2 hours (0.5 to 5 hours). The half-life of <b>nitrazepam</b> is between 16.5 and 48.3 hours. In young people, <b>nitrazepam</b> has a half-life of about 29 hours and a much longer half-life of 40 hours in the elderly. Both low dose (5mg) and high dose (10mg) of <b>nitrazepam</b> significantly increases growth hormone levels in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam</b> is not {{recommended}} for use in those under 18 years of age. Use in very young children may be especially dangerous. Children treated with <b>nitrazepam</b> for epilepsies may develop tolerance within months of continued use, with dose escalation often occurring with prolonged use. Sleepiness, deterioration in motor skills and ataxia were common side effects in children with tuberous sclerosis treated with <b>nitrazepam.</b> The side effects of <b>nitrazepam</b> may impair the development of motor and cognitive skills in children treated with <b>nitrazepam.</b> Withdrawal only occasionally resulted in a return of seizures and some children withdrawn from <b>nitrazepam</b> appeared to improve. Development, for example the ability to walk at five years of age, was impaired in many children taking <b>nitrazepam,</b> but was not impaired with several other nonbenzodiazepine antiepileptic agents. Children being treated with <b>nitrazepam</b> have been recommended to be reviewed and have their <b>nitrazepam</b> gradually discontinued whenever appropriate. Excess sedation, hypersalivation, swallowing difficulty, and high incidence of aspiration pneumonia, {{as well as several}} deaths, have been associated with <b>nitrazepam</b> therapy in children.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam's {{half-life}} in the cerebrospinal fluid, 68 hours, {{indicates that}} <b>nitrazepam</b> is eliminated extremely slowly from the cerebrospinal fluid. Concomitant food intake has no {{influence on the}} rate of absorption of <b>nitrazepam</b> nor on its bioavailability. Therefore, <b>nitrazepam</b> can be taken with or without food.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} {{hypnotic}} drugs, <b>nitrazepam</b> {{is associated with}} an increased risk of traffic accidents. <b>Nitrazepam</b> is recommended to be avoided in patients who drive or operate machinery. A study assessing driving skills of sedative hypnotic users found the users of <b>nitrazepam</b> to be significantly impaired up to 17 hours after dosing, whereas users of temazepam did not show significant impairments of driving ability. These results reflect the long-acting nature of <b>nitrazepam.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam</b> {{overdose}} {{may result}} in stereotypical symptoms of benzodiazepine overdose including intoxication, impaired balance and slurred speech. In cases of severe overdose this may progress to a comatose state {{with the possibility of}} death. The risk of <b>nitrazepam</b> overdose is increased significantly if <b>nitrazepam</b> is abused in conjunction with opioids, as was highlighted in a review of deaths of users of the opioid buprenorphine. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as <b>nitrazepam</b> can result in a severe neurological effects. <b>Nitrazepam</b> taken in overdose is associated {{with a high level of}} congenital abnormalities (30 percent of births). Most of the congentital abnormalities were mild deformities.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{contraceptive}} pills, {{reduce the}} clearance of <b>nitrazepam</b> which {{may lead to}} increased plasma levels of <b>nitrazepam</b> and accumulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam</b> {{can cause}} dependence, addiction, and {{benzodiazepine}} withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from <b>nitrazepam</b> {{may lead to}} withdrawal symptoms which {{are similar to those}} seen with alcohol and barbiturates. Common withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, concentration problems, and fatigue. Discontinuation of <b>nitrazepam</b> produced rebound insomnia after short-term single nightly dose therapy.|$|E
25|$|Rifampin {{increases}} the clearance of <b>nitrazepam</b> significantly and probenecid decreases its clearance significantly. Cimetidine slows down the elimination rate of <b>nitrazepam,</b> leading to more prolonged effects and {{increased risk of}} accumulation. Alcohol in combination with <b>nitrazepam</b> may cause a synergistic enhancement of the hypotensive properties of both benzodiazepines and alcohol.|$|E
25|$|The drug {{causes a}} delay in the onset, and {{decrease}} in the duration of REM sleep. Following discontinuation of the drug, REM sleep rebound {{has been reported in}} some studies. <b>Nitrazepam</b> is reported to significantly affect stages of sleep - a decrease in stage 1, 3, and 4 sleep and an increase in stage 2. In young volunteers, the pharmacological properties of <b>nitrazepam</b> were found to produce sedation and impaired psychomotor performance and standing steadiness. EEG tests showed decreased alpha activity and increased the beta activity, according to blood plasma levels of <b>nitrazepam.</b> Performance was significantly impaired 13 hours after dosing with <b>nitrazepam,</b> as were decision-making skills. EEG tests show more drowsiness and light sleep 18 hours after <b>nitrazepam</b> intake, more so than amylobarbitone. Fast activity was recorded via EEG 18 hours after <b>nitrazepam</b> dosing. An animal study demonstrated that <b>nitrazepam</b> induces a drowsy pattern of spontaneous EEG including high-voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the cortex and amygdala, while the hippocampal theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low-voltage fast waves occur particularly in the cortical EEG. The EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus is significantly suppressed. The photic driving response elicited by a flash light in the visual cortex is also suppressed by <b>nitrazepam.</b> Estazolam was found to be more potent however. <b>Nitrazepam</b> increases the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less time is spent in stages 3 and 4 which are the deep sleep stages, when benzodiazepines such as <b>nitrazepam</b> are used. Benzodiazepines are therefore not good hypnotics in the treatment of insomnia. The suppression of deep sleep stages by benzodiazepines may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam,</b> {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes {{impairments}} in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. Combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. <b>Nitrazepam</b> {{has been found to}} be dangerous in elderly patients due to a significantly increased risk of falls. This increased risk is probably due to the drug effects of <b>nitrazepam</b> persisting well into the next day. <b>Nitrazepam</b> is a particularly unsuitable hypnotic for the elderly as it induces a disability characterised by general mental deterioration, inability to walk, incontinence, dysarthric, confusion, stumbling, falls, and disoriention which can occur from doses as low as 5mg. The nitrazepam-induced symptomatology can lead to a misdiagnosis of brain disease in the elderly, for example dementia, and can also lead to the symptoms of postural hypotension which may also be misdiagnosed. A geriatric unit reportedly was seeing as many as seven patients a month with nitrazepam-induced disabilities and health problems. The drug was recommended to join the barbiturates in not being prescribed to the elderly. Only <b>nitrazepam</b> and lorazepam were found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. CNS depression occurs much more frequently in the elderly and is especially common in doses above 5mg of <b>nitrazepam.</b> Both young and old patients report sleeping better after three nights' use of <b>nitrazepam,</b> but they also reported feeling less awake and were slower on psychomotor testing up to 36 hours after intake of <b>nitrazepam.</b> The elderly showed cognitive deficits, making significantly more mistakes in psychomotor testing than younger patients despite similar plasma levels of the drug, suggesting the elderly are more sensitive to <b>nitrazepam</b> due to increased sensitivity of the aging brain to it. Confusion and disorientation can result from chronic <b>nitrazepam</b> administration to elderly subjects. Also, the effects of a single dose of <b>nitrazepam</b> may last up to 60 hours after administration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam</b> therapy, {{compared}} with other drug therapies, increases risk of death when used for intractable epilepsy {{in an analysis of}} 302 patients. The risk of death from <b>nitrazepam</b> therapy may be greater in younger patients (children below 3.4 years in the study) with intractable epilepsy. In older children (above 3.4 years), the tendency appears to be reversed in this study. <b>Nitrazepam</b> may cause sudden death in children. It can cause swallowing incoordination, high-peaked esophageal peristalsis, bronchospasm, delayed cricopharyngeal relaxation, and severe respiratory distress necessitating ventilatory support in children. <b>Nitrazepam</b> may promote the development of parasympathetic overactivity or vagotonia, leading to potentially fatal respiratory distress in children.|$|E
25|$|Severe <b>nitrazepam</b> {{overdose}} {{resulting in}} coma causes the central somatosensory conduction time (CCT) after median nerve stimulation to be prolonged and the N20 to be dispersed. Brain-stem {{auditory evoked potentials}} demonstrate delayed interpeak latencies (IPLs) I-III, III-V and I-V. Toxic overdoses therefore of <b>nitrazepam</b> cause prolonged CCT and IPLs. An alpha pattern coma can be a feature of <b>nitrazepam</b> overdose with alpha patterns being most prominent in the frontal and central regions of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines were {{implicated in}} 39% of suicides by drug {{poisoning}} in Sweden, with <b>nitrazepam</b> and flunitrazepam accounting for 90% of benzodiazepine implicated suicides, {{in the elderly}} {{over a period of}} 2 decades. In three quarters of cases death was due to drowning, typically in the bath. Benzodiazepines were the predominant drug class in suicides in this review of Swedish death certificates. In 72% of the cases benzodiazepines were the only drug consumed. Benzodiazepines and in particular <b>nitrazepam</b> and flunitrazepam should therefore be prescribed with caution in the elderly. In a brain sample of a fatal <b>nitrazepam</b> poisoning high concentrations of <b>nitrazepam</b> and its metabolite were found in the brain of the deceased person.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam</b> is {{sometimes}} tried to treat epilepsy when other medications fail. It {{has been found}} to be more effective than clonazepam in the treatment of West syndrome, which is an age-dependent epilepsy, affecting the very young. In uncontrolled studies, <b>nitrazepam</b> has shown effectiveness in infantile spasms and {{is sometimes}} considered when other anti-seizure drugs have failed. However, drowsiness, hypotonia, and most significantly tolerance to anti-seizure effects typically develop with long term treatment, generally limiting <b>Nitrazepam</b> to acute seizure management.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory tests {{assessing}} the toxicity of chlordiazepoxide, <b>nitrazepam</b> and diazepam on mice spermatozoa found that chlordiazepoxide produced toxicities in sperm including abnormalities involving both {{the shape and}} size of the sperm head. <b>Nitrazepam,</b> however, caused more profound abnormalities than chlordiazepoxide.|$|E
25|$|Recreational use of <b>nitrazepam</b> is common.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam</b> is not {{recommended}} during pregnancy as it is associated with causing a neonatal withdrawal syndrome and is not generally recommended in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals or people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The Dutch, British and French system called the System of Objectified Judgement Analysis for assessing whether drugs {{should be included in}} drug formularies based on clinical efficacy, adverse effects, pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity, and drug interactions was used to assess <b>nitrazepam.</b> A Dutch analysis using the system found <b>nitrazepam</b> to be unsuitable in drug-prescribing formularies.|$|E
25|$|Caution {{in those}} {{suffering}} from hypotension, <b>nitrazepam</b> may worsen hypotension.|$|E
25|$|In a {{retrospective}} study of deaths, when benzodiazepines were {{implicated in the}} deaths, the benzodiazepines <b>nitrazepam</b> and flunitrazepam were the most common benzodiazepines involved. Benzodiazepines were a factor in all deaths related to drug addiction {{in this study of}} causes of deaths. <b>Nitrazepam</b> and flunitrazepam were significantly more commonly implicated in suicide related deaths than natural deaths. In four of the cases benzodiazepines alone were the only cause of death. In Australia, <b>nitrazepam</b> and temazepam were the benzodiazepines most commonly detected in overdose drug related deaths. In a third of cases benzodiazepines were the sole cause of death.|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam is a {{chlorinated}} derivative of <b>nitrazepam</b> {{and therefore a}} chloro-nitro benzodiazepine.|$|E
25|$|It is long acting, lipophilic, and metabolised hepatically by {{oxidative}} pathways. It acts on benzodiazepine receptors in {{the brain}} which are associated with the GABA receptors, causing an enhanced binding of GABA to GABAA receptors. GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter {{in the brain}}, involved in inducing sleepiness, muscular relaxation, and control of anxiety and seizures, and slows down the central nervous system. The mechanism of action of <b>nitrazepam</b> is the same as other benzodiazepine drugs and zopiclone. The anticonvulsant properties of <b>nitrazepam</b> and other benzodiazepines may be in part or entirely due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems to be limited by benzodiazepines effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation in mouse spinal cord cell cultures. The muscle relaxant properties of <b>nitrazepam</b> are produced via inhibition of polysynaptic pathways in the spinal cord of decerebrate cats. It is a full agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor. The endogenous opioid system {{may play a role in}} some of the pharmacological properties of <b>nitrazepam</b> in rats. <b>Nitrazepam</b> causes a decrease in the cerebral contents of the amino acids glycine and alanine in the mouse brain. The decrease may be due to activation of benzodiazepine receptors. At high doses decreases in histamine turnover occur as a result of nitrazepam's action at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex in mouse brain. <b>Nitrazepam</b> has demonstrated cortisol-suppressing properties in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam</b> is a nitrobenzodiazepine. It is a 1,4 benzodiazepine, {{with the}} {{chemical}} name 1,3-Dihydro-7-nitro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4- benzodiazepin-2-one.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to the sleep-inducing {{effects of}} <b>nitrazepam</b> occurs after about seven days; {{tolerance}} also frequently occurs to its anticonvulsant effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam</b> is used {{to treat}} {{short-term}} sleeping problems (insomnia), namely difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakening, {{or a combination of}} each.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{with chronic}} {{illnesses}} {{are much more}} vulnerable to lethal overdose with <b>nitrazepam,</b> as fatal overdoses can occur at relatively low doses in these individuals.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{including}} <b>nitrazepam</b> may {{inhibit the}} glucuronidation of morphine, leading to {{increased levels of}} and prolongation {{of the effects of}} morphine in rat experiments.|$|E
25|$|Caution {{should be}} {{exercised}} {{by people who}} have hypothyroidism, as this condition may cause a long delay in the metabolism of <b>nitrazepam</b> leading to significant drug accumulation.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines, {{including}} diazepam, <b>nitrazepam,</b> and flunitrazepam, {{account for}} the largest volume of forged drug prescriptions in Sweden, a total of 52% of drug forgeries being for benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Long-term use of <b>nitrazepam</b> carries {{mental and}} {{physical}} health risks, such as the development of cognitive deficits. These adverse effects show improvement after a period of abstinence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with severe hepatic disorders, similar to other nitrobenzodiazepines. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as <b>nitrazepam,</b> nimetazepam, flunitrazepam, and clonazepam are more toxic to the liver than other benzodiazepines as they are metabolically activated by CYP3A4 which can result in cytotoxicity. This activation can lead to the generation of free radicals and oxidation of thiol, as well as covalent binding with endogenous macromolecules; this results, then, in oxidation of cellular components or inhibition of normal cellular function. Metabolism of a nontoxic drug to reactive metabolites has been causally connected with a variety of adverse reactions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam</b> {{interacts with}} the {{antibiotic}} erythromycin which is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, which affects concentration peak time. This interaction is not believed to be clinically important. However, anxiety, tremor, and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of <b>nitrazepam</b> and triazolam. Following administration of erythromycin to the patient, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. The patient had acute pneumonia and renal failure. Coadministration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other significant physical complications.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nitrazepam</b> {{should be}} avoided in {{patients}} with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), especially during acute exacerbations of COPD, because serious respiratory depression may occur in patients receiving hypnotics.|$|E
