500|$|Designers {{improved}} on {{the design}} of the Batsuit from Batman Begins, adding wide elastic banding to help bind the costume to Bale, and suggest more sophisticated technology. It was constructed from 200 individual pieces of rubber, fiberglass, metallic mesh, and nylon. The new cowl was modeled after a motorcycle helmet and separated from the <b>neck</b> <b>piece,</b> allowing Bale to turn his head left and right and nod up and down. The cowl is equipped to show white lenses over the eyes when the character turns on his sonar detection, which gives Batman the white eyed look from the comics and animation. The gauntlets have retractable razors which can be fired. Though the new costume is eight pounds heavier, Bale found it more comfortable and not as hot to wear. The depiction of Gotham City is less gritty than in Batman Begins. [...] "I've tried to unclutter the Gotham we created on the last film," [...] said production designer Nathan Crowley. [...] "Gotham is in chaos. We keep blowing up stuff, so we can keep our images clean." ...|$|E

60|$|The heavy gates swung to, and {{scarcely}} {{were they}} barred with the massive beams of oak, when the foremost of the Spaniards rode up to them. My bow {{was still in}} my hand and there was one arrow left in my quiver. I set it on the string, and drawing the bow with my full strength, I loosed the shaft through the bars of the gate at a young and gallant looking cavalier who rode the first of all. It struck him truly between the joint of his helm and <b>neck</b> <b>piece,</b> and stretching his arms out wide he fell backward over the crupper of his horse, to move no more. Then they withdrew, but presently one of their number came forward bearing a flag of truce. He was a knightly looking man, clad in rich armour, and watching him, {{it seemed to me that}} there was something in his bearing, and in the careless grace with which he sat his horse, that was familiar to me. Reining up in front of the gates he raised his visor and began to speak.|$|E

60|$|Alexander soon {{appeared}} {{at the head of}} his troops. Of course this day {{was one of the most}} important ones of his life, and one of the historians of the time has preserved an account of his dress as he went into battle. He wore a short tunic, girt close around him, and over it a linen breast-plate, strongly quilted. The belt by which the tunic was held was embossed with figures of beautiful workmanship. This belt was a present to him from some of the people of the conquered countries through which he had passed, and it was very much admired. He had a helmet upon his head, of polished steel, with a <b>neck</b> <b>piece,</b> also of steel, ornamented with precious stones. His helmet was surmounted with a white plume. His sword, which was a present to him from the King of Cyprus, was very light and slender, and of the most perfect temper. He carried, also, a shield and a lance, made in the best possible manner for use, not for display. Thus his dress corresponded with the character of his action. It was simple, compact, and whatever of value it possessed consisted in those substantial excellencies which would give the bearer the greatest efficiency on the field of battle.|$|E

5|$|Fishers {{have been}} trapped since the 18th century. They have been popular with trappers {{due to the}} value of their fur, which has been used for scarves and <b>neck</b> <b>pieces.</b> The best pelts are from winter {{trapping}} with secondary quality pelts from spring trapping. The lowest-quality furs come from out-of-season trapping when fishers are moulting. They are easily trapped, and the value of their fur was a particular incentive for catching this species.|$|R

50|$|This is {{an unusual}} and unique late 16th-century {{painting}} {{of a man with}} a physical disability. In typical portrait-style he gazes at the viewer, while {{the top of his head}} is covered by a hat. A fashionable <b>neck</b> <b>piece</b> separates his head from his naked body, which lies chest-down on a dark green sheet. His limbs appear withered and useless. Originally the portrait was partially obscured by a sheet of red paper, which the observer would lift to reveal the subject's body. Observers indicated that they were shocked. The man was probably a jester at a court. An extensive analysis of the painting has been published (see external links).|$|E
50|$|The {{uniform of}} Yokosuka 1st, 2nd, (for paratrooper {{training}} and fighting on land) and 3rd Rikusentais in Menado and West Timor battles in 1942 was the standard SNLF dark green with dark black or dark brown belts and harness. This uniform {{was based on}} the German model. It was later replaced by two types of green uniforms made from rip stop parachute silk with built in bandoliers and cargo pockets, being better designed than other paratrooper models of the time. This two-piece uniform was made of 50% cotton/50% silk. The hip length jacket had two differing pocket layouts, one had an angled pistol holster on the right chest, a two-grenade pocket on the left chest, and three smaller pockets for ammunition or grenades on each skirt side. The second version jacket had two pleated chest pockets and a smaller pleated skirt pockets. The trousers featured several variations of hip and cargo pockets. Headgear was similar to the IJA fieldcap but with a chinstrap and integral side and <b>neck</b> <b>piece.</b> Personnel also wore laced high brown leather boots as well as brown leather gloves.|$|E
2500|$|Beads are {{frequently}} used in jewellery. These {{may be made}} of glass, gemstones, metal, wood, shells, clay and polymer clay. Beaded jewellery commonly encompasses necklaces, bracelets, earrings, belts and rings.

50|$|While all the specs {{from the}} {{original}} RG550 are mirrored in the 20th Anniversary run, Ibanez have addressed one important issue. The original RG550 models sometimes suffered from catastrophic neck warpage, owing to the ultra-slim carve of the neck - {{the very thing that}} made the RG550 such a unique instrument in the first place. Instead of recreating the 2- or 3-piece neck of the late 1980s, which usually had a head piece and a longer <b>neck</b> <b>piece</b> glued together obliquely just behind the nut, Ibanez have revised the entire neck construction with the 20th Anniversary model. The neck on the new RG550 is a 5-piece laminate, with three strips of hard rock maple and two thin strips of walnut. The maple strips are arranged so that the grain on the outer two pieces is parallel, while the grain of the center strip is perpendicular to the other two, thereby granting the neck far more resistance to warping than the originals had. They also feature 2 titanium rods going down each side of the truss rod for added strength and rigidity.|$|E

40|$|Mammalian sperm must {{undergo a}} process known as {{capacitation}} before fertilization can take place. A key intracellular event that occurs during capacitation is protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate and visualize protein tyrosine phosphorylation patterns in human sperm during capacitation and interaction with the zona pellucida. The presence of specific patterns was also assessed in relation to the fertilizing capacity of the spermatozoa after in vitro fertilization. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was investigated by immunofluorescence. Phosphorylation increased significantly with capacitation and was localized mainly to the principal piece of human sperm. Following binding to the zona pellucida, the percentage of sperm with phosphotyrosine residues localized to both the neck and the principal piece was significantly higher in bound sperm than in capacitated sperm in suspension. When the percentage of principal piece-positive sperm present after capacitation was < 7 %, fertilization rates after in vitro fertilization were reduced. Different compartments of human spermatozoa undergo a specific sequence of phosphorylation during both capacitation and upon binding to the zona pellucida. Tyrosine phosphorylation in the principal and <b>neck</b> <b>piece</b> may be considered a prerequisite for fertilization in humans. Articl...|$|E

40|$|The {{partition}} {{between the}} light (L) {{and the heavy}} (H) fission fragments of the excitation energy available at scisssion is studied {{in the frame of}} the sudden approximation i. e., under the assumption that the neck rupture and the absorption of the <b>neck</b> <b>pieces</b> by the fragments happens infinitely fast. We are dealing with a sudden transition between two different nuclear configurations (a_i->a_f) and we only need to know the two sets of neutron eigenstates involved. The accent in the present work is put on the dependence of this share of energy on the mass asymmetry AL/AH of the primary fission fragments during the low-energy fission of 236 U. In particular, for every fragment mass A we estimate the scission neutron multiplicity nu_sc, the average energy cost for their release E_sci, the primary fragments’ excitation energy E_sc and the corresponding temperature Tsc. The results are analysed separately for each value of Omega (the projection of the angular momentum on the symmetry axis). As general trend, a decrease of E_sc (Tsc) and an increase of nu_sc (E_sci) with increasing A was observed. JRC. D. 4 -Nuclear physic...|$|R

40|$|The {{emission}} of scission neutrons is {{studied in the}} frame of the sudden approximation, i. e., under the assumption that fission motion is adiabatic until the neck ruptures at finite radius and that this rupture is followed by a sudden absorbtion of the <b>neck</b> <b>pieces</b> by the fragments. We are therefore dealing with a transition between two different nuclear configurations (epsilon(i) -> epsilon(f)) and we only need to know the corresponding two sets of neutron eigenstates. The accent in the present work is put on the dependence on the mass asymetry A(L) /A(H) of the primary fission fragments during the thermal neutron fission of U- 235. At epsilon(i), i. e., just before scission, the neutrons are considered both independent and pairing correlated. We estimate the scission neutron multiplicity nu(sc), the spatial distribution of the emission points S-em(rho, z) and the primary fragments' excitation energy E-sc*. nu(sc) is found to depend only slightly on A(L). The multiplicity has an average value of 0. 76 (which represents one third of the prompt neutron multiplicity) with a maximum deviation from this value of less than 0. 1. S-em(rho, z) is mainly concentrated in the region between the fragments giving a useful detail of the emission mechanism. E-sc* together with the extradeformation energy is used to evaporate neutrons and emit. rays from fully accelerated fragments...|$|R
