25|$|This {{does not}} mean that Sanders {{believes}} God’s knowledge of the future is “limited” as some critics have charged. Rather, Sanders holds that what is referred to as “the” future is not an ontological reality—it does not exist. If it is does not exist then there is literally “no thing” or actuality for God to know. Open theists are <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> there is a reality about which God is ignorant (which would be limited omniscience). The denial that God has exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events has been the single most controversial aspect of open theism.|$|E

Megan was the key to this video.... I'll tell you as a director the reason why [...] scenes in the video feel so real is because in the moment they were real.|$|E

Series' writer Joan Rater commented on this: [...] "Izzie getting the clean scan back gives Alex the freedom to leave. Because {{he never would have}} left her when she was sick, he's a good guy. And I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> Alex ever consciously thought, I can’t leave her while she's sick, but now that she's not, now that she seems like she's going to get better, it just comes to him. He deserves more. He's a good guy and he deserves more. But loving Izzie showed him that he can be good, is good. So it was a little gift. And when he tells Izzie he's done, he's not bitter or angry, he's just done." [...] The writing of the two-part season six finale, caused struggle to Rhimes. She elaborated on this: ...|$|E
50|$|Many medieval {{philosophers}} {{made use}} {{of the idea of}} approaching a knowledge of God through negative attributes.

We should <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God is wise, but we can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God is <b>not</b> ignorant (i.e. in some way God has some properties of knowledge). We should <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God is One, but we can state that there is no multiplicity in God's being.|$|R

500|$|Fox made no {{promises}} that his efforts {{would lead to}} a cure for cancer, but he closed his letter with the statement: [...] "We need your help. The people in cancer clinics all over the world need people who believe in miracles. I am not a dreamer, and I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. I believe in miracles. I have to." [...] The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy– an enlarged heart– a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.|$|E
500|$|Miguel held a {{press conference}} at the Las Ventas {{building}} in Madrid, Spain on the album's launch date of 13 September 1999. Miguel confirmed that it was the first album where he was more involved in the tracks' composition. [...] "Here something special was done, probably because I had more time to write a few things," [...] he added. When asked why he opted not to record an English-language album as other Latin acts such as Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin had successfully done, Miguel replied: [...] "I think that Spanish is a good language. I like my language and I really feel proud of it. I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> I won't do it in the future, sing in English, I mean. But it's just that it's not the right time for me. Why should I do it, just because everybody else is doing it?" [...] He was also asked about the lack of a duet with his then-girlfriend Mariah Carey to which he responded that he does not like to involve his personal life with his career. However, Miguel noted that the music he performs is based on his feelings at the time, and hinted the album's title was influenced by his relationship with Carey.|$|E
500|$|Manchester City's {{downward}} trajectory {{toward the}} Second Division {{continued in the}} 1997–98 season, and on 17 February 1998, manager Frank Clark was sacked. His replacement, Joe Royle, was appointed City manager on 18 February 1998. He {{had a reputation for}} playing defensive midfielders, which led to his Everton team being nicknamed the [...] "Dogs of War". Royle viewed Kinkladze as an unaffordable luxury in a relegation battle, and in his first board meeting as Manchester City manager, he opened proceedings with the words [...] "We have to sell Kinkladze". After playing the first two games under Royle, a 1–2 loss on 18 February against Ipswich Town, and a 3–1 win against Swindon Town on 23 February, [...] Kinkladze sustained an ankle injury, which sidelined him for a month. He made his return at Port Vale on 14 March, despite having taken little part in training in the preceding week. Port Vale were a team with a physically robust approach, and used the muddy conditions to their advantage. Kinkladze was played out of position on the right wing, much to his displeasure, and gave a performance that the Manchester Evening News summarised as [...] "barely noticeable". Vale defeated City 2–1, and Royle severely criticised Kinkladze for a lack of effort, dropping him for the next six games. In 2005, Royle explained his view of Kinkladze in his autobiography: [...] "To the supporters he was the only positive in all that time. To me, he was a big negative. I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> City's ills were all down to Kinkladze, but there was too much about the whole Kinkladze cult phenomenon that wasn't right ...too often since his arrival, the team had under-performed. I couldn't help deducing that contrary to popular opinion, he would be my weak link not my strong one." [...] With two games remaining, Manchester City were in the relegation places, and Kinkladze was restored to the starting lineup for the home match against Queens Park Rangers (QPR). The QPR team contained Vinnie Jones, who had a violent reputation and played using the axiom [...] "if their top geezer gets sorted out early doors, you win". Jones tried to apply his philosophy to Kinkladze, even targeting him in the tunnel {{before the start of the}} match. Kinkladze opened the scoring with a free kick, but City could not maintain their lead. Defending described by The Observers reporter as a [...] "calamity" [...] culminated in an unusual own goal from Jamie Pollock, and meant the match ended in a 2–2 draw. City were relegated for the second time in three seasons despite a final day 5–2 win against Stoke City. In total, Kinkladze made 119 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 22 goals. He played regular international football during this period of his career, including in a 0–0 draw with three-time World Cup winners Italy.|$|E

I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the monarchy must be abolished, but it will take some thought, especially on its usefulness and relevance.

Sessions rejected criticisms of successful circuit court nominee Dennis Shedd's record, saying he [...] "should have been commended for the rulings he has made". In 2003, Sessions viewed criticisms of Alabama Attorney General William H. Pryor Jr.'s ultimately successful circuit court appointment as being due to his faith, stating that [...] "Are we <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> good Catholics need not apply?" ...|$|E

[...] In response to the controversy Reverend Peter Owens-Jones of the Church Advertising Network (CAN) who designed the ad stated [...] "We are <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> Jesus was communist, {{but that he was}} revolutionary.

[...] Sue was accompanied by two acquaintances one of which was former professional NFL football player Edgar Chandler.|$|E
2500|$|Roy Graham, an Adventist scholar has {{explained}} {{his interpretation of}} what Ellen White's statement on being a lesser light means. He writes [...] "The moon is called in Scripture the 'lesser light'. We know that it shines with 'borrowed light' from the sun. But this {{does not make the}} moon any less 'authoritative.' It has its sphere and its appointed task in God's creation. So when Ellen White uses this term to describe her work, she is not just being modest or humble; she is <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> she is a second-class prophet; she is <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> her messages are of a less important or less urgent nature than those of the Biblical prophets. Rather, she is emphasizing the function of her role and her messages. The work of any one prophet cannot be compared to the cumulative light that shines across the centuries from the many prophets whose works are found in the Holy Scriptures. But the source of her ministry is the same as theirs, and while her work was primarily for the Seventh-day Adventist church, this in no wise diminishes the importance of her role to that people[...] [...] [...] She is one and the canonical prophets are many. But both she and they were commissioned by the Holy Spirit to accomplish specific tasks for God's people. It is important to discern the distinctive function of both." ...|$|E

"Keeps a taut ship," [...] remarked contemporaries at the Pentagon, {{but also}} [...] "keeps a tight lip," [...] despite a {{reputation}} for florid speech and unusually lengthy prepared statements before Congressional committees. For example, when asked by a House Appropriations subcommittee whether it was Navy policy to promote personnel on discharge {{even if they had}} been discharged because of Communist affiliations, a charge Senator Joseph R. McCarthy had leveled against the Army, Holloway replied, [...] "It is not. I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> in criticism of anyone else...Sometimes, in the best of families, the right hand does not know what the left hand doeth. But it is certainly not the policy in the Navy, and it is one we abjure." ...|$|E

2500|$|There was a {{great deal}} of data.

They chose that title [...] "because of their radical political orientation" [...] and clarify [...] "we are <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> all in this group commit acts of violence. However, those with extremist views are a potential source for recruitment or support for terrorist groups." [...] The data also indicates that poverty is not simply to blame for the comparatively radical views of this 7% of Muslims, who tend to be better educated than moderates.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year after}} winning his first National Cup title, Turner guided Killester {{back to the}} final in January 2011; however, this time they were outdone by UCD Marian, losing 60–57 despite Turner scoring a team-high 12 points. In March 2017, Turner noted that the 2011 Cup loss to UCD Marian was the biggest regret of his career, saying [...] "After my first cup win with Killester, going on to lose the second one to UCD Marian is {{probably}} the biggest regret I have. <b>Not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> Marian didn't deserve it, but we didn't take Marian seriously enough that year. They punished us for it I guess." [...] Killester redeemed themselves on March 27, 2011, as they defeated Neptune 84–80 in the Nivea For Men's SuperLeague final to win back-to-back titles, with Turner scoring 14 points in the championship decider.|$|E

You're getting so {{abstract}} now [...] you're talking about cutting taxes, {{and all these things}} you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [...] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that.</b> But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, [...] "We want to cut this", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and {{a hell of a lot}} more abstract than [...] "Nigger, nigger".|$|E
