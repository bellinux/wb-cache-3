5|$|The RF {{claimed that}} the bloody civil wars, {{military}} coups and other disasters that plagued the new majority-ruled African states to the north, many of which had become corrupt, autocratic or communist one-party states very soon after independence, showed that black nationalist leaders were not ready to govern. Influenced strongly by the white refugees who had fled south from the Congo, it presented chaotic doomsday scenarios of what black nationalist rule in Southern Rhodesia might mean, particularly for the white community. Proponents of the RF stand downplayed black nationalist grievances regarding land ownership and segregation, and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was <b>not</b> <b>racist</b> as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity. They emphasised the colony's proud war record on Britain's behalf, and expressed a wish in the Cold War context to form an anti-communist, pro-Western front in Africa alongside South Africa and Portugal.|$|E
25|$|Not all Reconstructionists {{accept this}} view.

25|$|When an 8-year-old {{girl was}} raped in March 1998, the police {{initially}} described two black males as the culprits. Lee {{was criticized for}} declaring every black man in the subdivision a suspect. He apologized for any offense but insisted the practice was <b>not</b> <b>racist.</b> In fact, friends said the sheriff was so personally shaken by the vicious attack on the girl, who was also black, that he pulled {{out all the stops}} to solve the case.|$|E

2500|$|Baldwin {{believes}} that [...] "the South {{was right in}} the War Between the States", and that the leaders of the Confederacy were <b>not</b> <b>racists.</b> He uses the term [...] "War for Southern Independence". He bemoans George W. Bush's failure to rescind executive orders by Bill Clinton that appear to undermine states' rights and private property rights.|$|R
25|$|Jensen {{also argued}} that even if g were {{replaced}} by a model with several intelligences this would change the situation less than expected. He argues that all tests of cognitive ability {{would continue to be}} highly correlated with one another and there would still be a black-white gap on cognitive tests. Hans Eysenck responded to Gould by stating that no psychologist had said that intelligence was an area located in the brain. Eysenck also argued IQ tests were <b>not</b> <b>racist,</b> pointing out that Northeast Asians and Jews both scored higher than non-Jewish Europeans on IQ tests, and this would not please European racists.|$|E
25|$|While trolls {{believe that}} they do not face {{consequences}} and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in suicides attributed to bullying, more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading hate speech such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and <b>not</b> <b>racist.</b> One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012). This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals {{and they have to be}} aware that they have to face the consequences of their actions.|$|E

The books were later turned into the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones. Dwight later compares learning Dothraki to learning Klingon, a fictional language from franchise Star Trek. Andy refers to Ladysmith Black Mambazo as [...] "Ladysmith African-American Mambazo" [...] {{in an attempt to}} prove he is <b>not</b> <b>racist.</b> Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) later changes Andy's ringtone to the song [...] "Dixie".|$|E

50|$|Among Fiore's ideas {{was that}} far right white {{nationalist}} groups should form alliances with national liberation movements and separatists. Williamson and Harrington pioneered {{this in the}} National Front in the 1980s, but apart from allowing them {{to say they were}} <b>not</b> <b>racists</b> because they had black allies, the policy was not a success. The National Liberal Party has kept up this strategy, appealing for ethnic minority votes by focusing on national struggles abroad and with particular emphasis on injustices in Sri Lanka and India.|$|R
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1970s, British metalheads {{coalesced}} into {{a closed}} community of peers that exalted power and celebrated masculinity. According to Deena Weinstein's analysis, their male camaraderie and the general absence of women in their ranks did not turn into machismo and misogyny. In the same article, she wrote that British heavy metal: [...] "is <b>not</b> <b>racist,</b> despite its uniformly white performers, and its lyrics are devoid of racial references." [...] Another characteristic of the subculture was its latent homophobia, less violent, but not dissimilar to British skinheads' disposition; in his book Running with the Devil: Power, Gender and Madness in Heavy Metal Music, Robert Walser calls it a [...] "collective affirmation of heterosexuality", and in a journal British sociologist John Clarke regards it as [...] "a reaction against the erosion of traditionally available stereotypes of masculinity".|$|E
500|$|In contrast, on 1UP.com, Parish {{argued in}} favor of Barret, noting that while on the surface he {{appeared}} to be the [...] "worst kind of stereotype," [...] he was a great character with complexity, having made [...] "difficult decisions in his life, and agonized over his losses." [...] Parish went further to describe Barret as the [...] "first true father figure the [...] series had ever seen," [...] noting his relationship with his adopted daughter. RPGamer's content manager Shawn Bruckner took the discussion further, arguing that claims of Barret's presentation being racist was oversimplification of the character's portrayal, and stated that while he was in some aspects a stereotype, in others, such as his compassion towards his daughter or guilt regarding his past actions, he was not. He added that Barret [...] "shows us that a black man speaking in 'ebonics' is not something to fear," [...] and that his portrayal was <b>not</b> <b>racist,</b> but instead the opposite.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{sequence}} of [...] "Donnie Fatso" [...] featured a Fox News helicopter {{with the words}} [...] "Merry Christmas from Fox News… But no other holidays."

Bill O'Reilly, host of The O'Reilly Factor, harshly criticized the show, calling the producers [...] "pinheads". He resumed: [...] "Continuing to bite the hand that feeds part of it, Fox broadcasting once again allows its cartoon characters to run wild." [...] In response, producers added a brief scene {{at the beginning of}} the opening sequence in the following episode, [...] "How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?", in which a helicopter appears bearing the slogan [...] "Fox News: Unsuitable for Viewers Under 75." [...] The scene was later removed from the opening {{sequence of}} [...] "How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?", and was replaced by one reminiscing the film King Kong. According to showrunner Al Jean, the producers of the show were pleased that they had annoyed O'Reilly, exclaiming that it was [...] "very entertaining for [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Whitehead's United Federal Party was {{defeated}} in the 1962 Southern Rhodesian general election by the Rhodesian Front (RF), an all-white, firmly conservative party led by Winston Field whose declared goal was independence for Southern Rhodesia without major constitutional changes and without commitment to any set timetable regarding black majority rule. RF proponents downplayed black nationalist grievances regarding land ownership and segregation, and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was <b>not</b> <b>racist</b> as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity. Beadle expressed an extremely low opinion of the RF. Ian Smith, who replaced Field as Prime Minister in 1964, was in Beadle's eyes an unconvincing leader; Desmond Lardner-Burke, the Justice Minister, was a [...] "fascist" [...] and a [...] "small time country solicitor... incapable of producing correct documents for an undefended divorce action". The same year Smith took over, Beadle {{became a member of}} the Privy Council in London and president of the new Appellate Division of the Southern Rhodesian High Court. In this latter role he blocked a Legislative Assembly act to extend periods of preventive restriction outside times of emergency, ruling it against the declaration of rights contained in Southern Rhodesia's 1961 constitution.|$|E

2500|$|The club claims {{not to be}} {{a racially}} {{segregated}} organization, although at least one chapter allegedly requires that a candidate be a white male, and Sonny Barger stated in a BBC interview in 2000 that [...] "The club, as a whole, is <b>not</b> <b>racist</b> but we probably have enough racist members that no black guy is going to get in it". At that time the club had no black members.|$|E
50|$|Maurice Ostroff, a past {{chairman}} of the Israel South Africa Chamber of Commerce and a pro-Israel commentator, said {{that the results of}} the poll reveals that a vast majority of Israelis are <b>not</b> <b>racists,</b> and that the level of racism in Israel is lower than in most Western countries and in the Arab world. He cited an Amnesty International study titled “Choice and prejudice - discrimination against Muslims in Europe”, which found that public opinion in several European countries reflects Islamophobic views combined with racist attitudes. Another poll, he wrote, found that three-quarters of Qataris would object to a non-Muslim neighbor.|$|R

5000|$|With {{his writing}} partner, Harry Driver, the duo {{was hired to}} write {{material}} for comedian Harry Worth in Manchester. Powell and Driver created and wrote 11 sitcoms for ITV in an eight-year period, including the successful shows Bless This House and Love Thy Neighbour, though other writers contributed scripts to both series. The latter programme, according to The Times, was [...] "intended to debunk racial stereotypes but came to be widely condemned for doing exactly the opposite. ... Powell and Driver were <b>not</b> <b>racists,</b> they merely tried to poke fun at racial bigotry in an era before political correctness would have made such a show impossible." ...|$|R
2500|$|Blainey's speech, {{along with}} {{subsequent}} articles {{and a book}} on the subject, ignited nationwide controversy, especially in the Australian federal parliament which had not debated the principles of the immigration policy for many years.

Desi Xpress staff expressed regret to Tatchell {{and gave him a}} right of reply, and Yosef apologised and retracted his article, claiming the [...] "slap in the face" [...] remark was a [...] "figure of speech" [...] and the remark about Australia was <b>not</b> <b>racist.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, Ta Mok {{and other}} leaders, {{organized}} the mass killing of ideologically suspect groups, ethnic minorities such as ethnic Vietnamese, Chinese (or Sino-Khmers), Chams and Thais, former civil servants, former government soldiers, Buddhist monks, secular intellectuals and professionals, and former city dwellers. Khmer Rouge cadres defeated in factional struggles were also liquidated in purges. Man-made famine and slave labor resulted in {{many hundreds of}} thousands of deaths. Craig Etcheson suggested that the death toll was between 2 and 2.5million, with a [...] "most likely" [...] figure of 2.2million. After 5 years of researching 20,000 grave sites, he concluded that [...] "these mass graves contain the remains of 1,386,734 victims of execution." [...] However, some scholars argued that the Khmer Rouge were <b>not</b> <b>racist</b> and had no intention of exterminating ethnic minorities or the Cambodian people; in this view, their brutality was the product of an extreme version of communist ideology.|$|E

Hanson informed Schlessinger that her acquaintances had stated, [...] "How you black people do this? You black people like doing that." [...] Schlessinger responded that her examples were <b>not</b> <b>racist</b> and that [...] "a lot of blacks only voted for Obama simply because he was half black.

50|$|In comics, nameless black {{bystanders}} (see right) {{and even}} some notable heroes and villains were developed in this style, including Ebony White (see above), and Steamboat, valet of Billy Batson. In erotic comics, blacks are at times portrayed as hypersexual, and accompanying physical features such as a macrophallic penis in black men. Robert Crumb's underground comix character Angelfood McSpade, introduced in 1967, embodied all of these qualities. Crumb intended the character {{to be critical of}} the racist stereotype itself and assumed that the young liberal hippie/intellectual audience who read his work were <b>not</b> <b>racists,</b> and that they would understand his intentions for the character. Nonetheless, in the face of accusations of racism and sexism, Crumb retired the character after 1971.|$|R
