5|$|Melvin Frohike visits Scully's {{apartment}} and shows her a <b>newspaper</b> <b>article</b> about Kenneth Soona's murder. When {{she returns to}} FBI headquarters, the metal detector curiously goes off. Scully presents Skinner with the <b>newspaper</b> <b>article,</b> thinking that the data from Soona's death can clear Mulder in his father's murder. Skinner, however, refuses to do any follow-up on it. After Scully leaves it is revealed that the Cigarette Smoking Man was waiting in an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has a hunch upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal {{in the back of}} her neck. Scully sees a doctor, who removes a small metal implant.|$|E

5|$|Riley's school {{attendance}} was sporadic, and {{he graduated from}} grade eight at age twenty in 1869. In an 1892 <b>newspaper</b> <b>article,</b> Riley confessed that he knew little of mathematics, geography, or science, and his understanding of proper grammar was poor. Later critics, like Henry Beers, pointed to his poor education {{as the reason for}} his success in writing; his prose was written in the language of common people which spurred his popularity.|$|E

Data from Swiss direct-democratic campaigns on school policy between 2000 and 2012 are used to compare <b>newspaper</b> <b>articles</b> that contain evaluations with those that do not refer to evaluations. Results show that those <b>newspaper</b> <b>articles</b> containing evaluations exhibit higher levels of justification, reciprocity and respect, tend to argue in terms of the common good, and contain less storytelling than <b>newspaper</b> <b>articles</b> that do not refer to evaluations. Implications for public deliberation and evaluation practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{emphasis}} on authenticity of materials in Communicative Language Teaching has helped reappraise the pedagogical value of <b>newspaper</b> <b>articles,</b> producing dozens of EFL/ESL textbooks which contain <b>newspaper</b> <b>articles</b> as the target reading passages. <b>Newspaper</b> <b>articles</b> in those textbooks, however, usually report events {{that took place}} {{more than a year}} before and thus have already lost much of their immediacy and consequently some of their pedagogical value as well. This paper reports a simple but effective use of <b>newspaper</b> <b>articles</b> in the form of a weekly short quiz in advanced EFL reading classes for university students. This weekly newspaper quiz not only takes full advantage of <b>newspaper</b> <b>articles</b> as authentic reading materials but also focuses on their immediacy as an important motivating factor for advanced EFL students. Merits of this weekly newspaper quiz are discussed from various points of view, and the students' reaction to the quiz is also analyzed...|$|R

5|$|A 1947 <b>newspaper</b> <b>article</b> {{estimated}} that the new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|E
5|$|Although bottle pool's origins remain obscure, tournament {{records and}} {{newspaper}} articles {{confirm that the}} game has been played {{since at least the}} late 19th century. A mention appears in an 1894 New York Times <b>newspaper</b> <b>article</b> announcing a 64 player tournament to be played at a certain Hanover Clubhouse in Brooklyn, New York. The game was more well known in the early-to-mid-20th century, during which references to it appear in numerous books and publications including Sinclair Lewis's Main Street. It is also known to have been played by some notable individuals, such as world-renowned quantum chemist and biochemist Linus Pauling.|$|E

April (Aubrey Plaza), who has romantic feelings for Andy, overhears this and leaves jealously. Evelyn demands delivery of Fairway Frank. Leslie responds that there is uncertainty about the identity of Fairway Frank. She refuses {{to hand over the}} captured opossum and creates a ketchup-blood diversion so that April can escape with the caged animal.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, Macartney and {{his family}} moved from Maitland to Sydney. In his school cricketing career Macartney {{distinguished}} himself as an all-rounder at Woollahra Superior and Chatswood public schools, before briefly attending Fort Street High School. Macartney asserted that school cricket was insignificant in his development, believing that he learned more about cricket during informal summer cricket games with his brother at the local park, with their dog acting as a fielder. It was during his school career that Macartney was noticed by incumbent Australian captain Monty Noble, who heaped praise on him in a <b>newspaper</b> <b>article.</b>|$|E

The attacks were prompted by a <b>newspaper</b> <b>article</b> about several members of Eugene's Jewish community, including a lesbian. Community organizations, including a local gay rights group, responded by standing vigil outside the synagogue during Passover services.

5|$|While Shay was {{managing}} at Kansas City in early 1910, American Association president Thomas Chivington imposed new conduct {{rules for the}} league. The new system emphasized fines for players and managers rather than simply ejecting them when they behaved poorly. After Shay was ejected from three games in a four-game span, a Minnesota <b>newspaper</b> <b>article</b> questioned whether his behavior {{would be subject to}} additional disciplinary action. The next month, Shay released 48-year-old Jake Beckley, prompting his retirement after one of the longest careers in professional baseball history. The first baseman had tried to make the Kansas City team after 20 years in the National League.|$|E

5|$|At Quantico, someone slips a <b>newspaper</b> <b>article</b> under Scully's door {{enabling}} her {{to identify}} the original body as a crew member on a Russian ship. Mulder and Scully meet at the processing plant and {{they look at the}} strange, fluke-like man. Skinner wants to prosecute the creature and subject it to a psychiatric evaluation, which Mulder thinks would be difficult. Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that this would have been an X-File had they still been open. Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have saved a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the chain of command.|$|E
5|$|At the morgue, Scully {{explains}} that {{she studied the}} bite wounds and discovered that they are similar, but intrinsically different, than human bites; the saliva on the regurgitated fingers has anti-coagulants in it, which only bats have in their saliva. Doggett finds the evidence interesting, due to the <b>newspaper</b> <b>article</b> he brought Scully: in 1956, a series of deaths was reported that ended {{when a group of}} hunters killed a man-bat creature and brought it to the county morgue in part of Montana. The coroner said the creature was neither bat nor man. Then the coroner was killed a few days later and soon after a few more people were killed or disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Between 1964 and 1970, Weizsäcker {{served as}} President of the German Evangelical Church Assembly. He {{was also a}} member of the Synod and the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany from 1967–1984. During his early tenure as President, he wrote a <b>newspaper</b> <b>article</b> {{supporting}} a memorandum written by German evangelical intellectuals including Werner Heisenberg and his brother Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker who had spoken out in favour of accepting the Oder–Neisse line as the western border of Poland as an indispensable precondition for lasting peace in Europe. While this was met by negative reactions from politicians, especially in Weizsäcker's own party, he nevertheless led the Evangelical Church on a way to promoting reconciliation with Poland, leading to a memorandum by the Church in both West and East Germany. The paper was widely discussed and met with a significantly more positive response.|$|E

5|$|In 1942 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought 1,261acres (510ha), {{including}} the glens and their waterfalls, from the heirs for $82,000. Ricketts Glen State Park opened in 1944. The state bought {{a total of}} 16,000acres (6,500ha) more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $68,000; the park today has about 10,000acres (4,000ha) from the Ricketts family and about 3,000acres (1,200ha) acquired from others. A 1947 <b>newspaper</b> <b>article</b> estimated that the new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added.

5|$|The {{excavated}} hoard {{was taken}} to the British Museum. The discovery was leaked to the press, and on 19 November, the Sun newspaper ran a front-page story, alongside a picture of Lawes with his metal detector. Although the full contents of the hoard and its value were still unknown, the <b>newspaper</b> <b>article</b> claimed that the hoard was worth £10 million. In response to the unexpected publicity, the British Museum held a press conference at the museum on 20 November to announce the discovery. Newspapers lost interest in the hoard quickly, allowing British Museum curators to sort, clean and stabilize the hoard without further disruption from the press. The initial cleaning and basic conservation of the hoard was completed within a month of its discovery.|$|E
5|$|The park {{district}} {{does not}} appear to have moved the carousel after taking over in 1945, as a 1955 <b>newspaper</b> <b>article</b> noted it was still in the same spot it had occupied for 38years. The carousel was again operated as a concession within the park, this time by the wife of Everett DuBois, the park superintendent. Like Hubbs, Mrs. DuBois operated the carousel for almost 10years. Although the district did not change the ride's location, it noted in 1955 that the equipment was showing its age. In 1955 the park district attempted to paint over the oil paintings on the canopy, which had deteriorated. The Indianapolis Art League objected, and volunteered to restore the original paintings rather than have them painted over with Disney characters.|$|E
