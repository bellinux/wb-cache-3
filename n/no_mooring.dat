2500|$|As {{originally}} planned, the Empire State Building's spire {{was supposed}} to be used as an airship docking station. Raskob and Smith proposed dirigible ticketing offices and passenger waiting rooms on the 86th floor, while the airships themselves would be tied to the spire at the equivalent of the building's 106th floor. An elevator between the 86th and 101st floors would carry passengers after they checked in on the 86th floor, with steep ladders leading to the airship's entrance. The idea was impractical and dangerous, due to the powerful updrafts caused by the building itself, the wind currents across Manhattan, and the spires of nearby skyscrapers, Furthermore, even if the airship were to successfully navigate all these obstacles, its crew would have to jettison some ballast by releasing water onto the streets below in order to maintain stability, and then tie the craft's nose to the spire with <b>no</b> <b>mooring</b> lines tying {{the other end of the}} craft to the ground. On September 15, 1931, in the first and only instance of an airship using the building's mast, a small commercial United States Navy airship circled 25 times in [...] winds. The airship then attempted to dock at the mast, but its ballast spilled and the craft itself was roiled by capricious eddies. The near-disaster scuttled plans to make the building's spire into an airship terminal, although one blimp did manage to make a single newspaper delivery afterward.|$|E

50|$|At this time, now the {{memories}} of the long and often fratricidal wars with the Judge of Arborea was ebbing away, the Iberian settlers were now included in the Sardinian society, with the passing of generations, becoming an integral part for inclusion in a political organization in which not only Sardinia, but also Aragon and Catalonia were small components. It meant that the accession at the Imperial Habsburg Ideology, reinvigorate also the sense of belonging to that little State that was represented by the Four Moors. Over the centuries the flag or coat of arms of the four Moors were depicted in various ways: without bandage, with blindfold or forehead, facing to luff or to fly end, or crowned, with <b>no</b> <b>Moors,</b> in reverse, and this according to the mode of the charged artist, such as that under the leadership of Diego Vel√°zquez and Francisco de Zurbaran represented in the Palacio del Buen Retiro in Madrid.

40|$|Most {{pregnant}} women in Burkina Faso are iron deficient {{and many are}} anemic. This study assessed women's understanding of anemia {{and the role of}} iron in preventing and treating this condition. A qualitative study was conducted within a randomized controlled trial of weekly iron supplementation in a rural malaria endemic area. Focus groups with women of similar age, parity, and marital status took place in 12 of 24 study villages. Two additional focus groups were conducted with female field workers. Tape-recorded transcripts were translated into French and analyzed using Framework analysis. Anemia, for which <b>no</b> <b>Moor,</b> term or traditional treatment for anemia was evident, was described in terms of blood volume. Moderate blood loss (diminished blood) could be easily replaced by eating well and was not considered serious. Massive blood loss (finished blood) was a rare, life-threatening illness. Iron tablets could increase blood volume and help women withstand massive blood loss at delivery, but for the latter, transfusion was indicated. Women had no knowledge of iron's role and did not readily concede that iron supplements contained elemental iron. Neither adolescents nor field workers were convinced of the benefits of supplementing non-pregnant adolescents, who were incorrectly considered to be at low risk of anemia. Young women's knowledge of anemia did not provide an adequate explanatory framework to motivate anemia prevention. Improving information on the role of iron is especially important for adolescent girls who may be incorrectly considered at low risk of anemia as they have not yet experienced pregnanc...|$|R

On 29 January, the submarine launched three torpedoes at a destroyer believed to be the Thai Phra Ruang (the former R-class destroyer HMS Radiant) and watched each run true to the target. However, all proved to be duds. On 7 February, she sighted tanker Nisshin Maru <b>No.</b> 2 <b>moored</b> off Lutong, Borneo. She made a submerged approach, launched two torpedoes at the target, heard one explosion, and observed smoke rise from the stern of the tanker. However, no sinking upon this occasion was confirmed.
