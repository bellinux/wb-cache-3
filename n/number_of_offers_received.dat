40|$|We {{consider}} a model with on-the-job search where current wages depend only on current aggregate and match-specific idiosyncratic productivities. We nevertheless {{show that the}} model replicates findings which have been interpreted as evidence against a spot market model. Past aggregate labor market conditions such as the lowest unemployment rate during a job spell or the unemployment rate {{at the start of}} the job have explanatory power for current wages since the expected wage is increasing in the expected <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>offers</b> <b>received</b> since the job started. The business-cycle volatility of wages is higher for new hires and for job-to-job switchers than for job stayers since workers can sample from a larger pool of job offers in a boom than in a recession. Using PSID and NLSY data, we find that the existing evidence against a spot market model is rejected once we control for match-specific productivity as implied by our theory. ∗We would like to thank participants at the 2008 Society for Economic Dynamics annual meeting an...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedBudgetary {{concerns over the}} last decade have put increased pressure on federal agencies to improve efficiency and create cost savings. Accordingly, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and other watchdog groups have increasingly scrutinized government source selections; GAO reports and procurement experts alike indicate opportunities for improvement in this area. To aid in this improvement initiative, our research focuses on the contract management process, with special emphasis on the source selection methods of tradeoff and lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA). Specifically, our data analysis explores the relationship of source selection methods to the contract outcomes of procurement administrative lead times (PALT) and contractor performance assessment reporting system (CPARS) ratings. The results of our analysis showed no statistically significant relationship between source selection method and contract outcomes. However, other variables, namely the number of evaluation factors and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>offers</b> <b>received,</b> were shown to {{have a significant effect on}} PALT. At the conclusion of this MBA Professional Report, we present suggestions for further research to build upon these findings. Captain, United States Air Forc...|$|E
40|$|Government {{conservation}} {{agencies that}} conduct reverse auctions traditionally provide {{a significant amount}} of public information about past auction results. This information includes not only the amount of money spent by the government but also can include the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>offers</b> <b>received,</b> number of offers accepted, highest accepted bid, lowest accepted bid, and the average accepted bid. This research uses induced-value experiments to evaluate the effect of past auction information on seller rent seeking. Results from 140 participants suggest that sellers use some public information to learn how to secure higher rents. However, when sellers are given information only about the buyers’ budget, they secure lower rents. Results also suggest that relative budget size affects rents and that budget variability in the presence of market information diminishes the effect. Thus, in the presence of public information and equivalent total outlays, variable budgets are more likely than stationary budgets to achieve conservation auction fiscal efficiency. Finally, this research finds that auctions with greater heterogeneity in seller opportunity costs are less fiscally efficient than when the distribution is more homogeneous...|$|E

40|$|Job search self-efficacy (JSSE) {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied {{variables}} in the job search literature and an important component of the theory of planned behavior and self-regulation theory which have both been used to explain the job search process. However, even though JSSE has been a part of job search research for thirty years, the measurement of JSSE has varied from study to study. This questions both the validity of the measures used and the findings from each study that used a different measure. In this paper, we propose and test a two dimensional measure of JSSE that corresponds to job search behavior (JSSE-B) and job search outcomes (JSSE-O). The results of a longitudinal study of employed and unemployed job seekers support a two-factor model corresponding to the two dimensions of JSSE. We also found differential relationships between each dimension of JSSE and several antecedents and consequences. Among the antecedents, environmental exploration and self-exploration were stronger predictors of JSSE-B while career planning was a stronger predictor of JSSE-O. In terms of consequences, JSSE-B was a stronger predictor of job search intention and behavior while JSSE-O was a stronger predictor <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> job <b>offers</b> <b>received.</b> These findings provide support for two dimensions of JSSE and have important implications for job search research and practice...|$|R

In this article, the authors empirically examine the factors that universities use in their decision to offer athletic scholarships to high school football players. Using a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) model, the authors find a player’s weight, height, body mass index (BMI), race, speed, on-the-field performance, and his high school team’s success often have large and significant impacts on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> scholarship <b>offers</b> he <b>receives.</b> There is also evidence of a negative relationship between academic performance and scholarship offers.

40|$|A dynamic self-regulatory {{perspective}} {{is useful to}} explain within- and between-person variations in job search behaviors (e. g., Barber, Daly, Giannantonio, & Phillips, 1994; Kanfer, Wanberg, Kantrowitz, 2001). However, few studies have incorporated models and designs appropriate for addressing when and why individuals are persistent in their job search activities. In addition, although goal orientation and attribution are highly relevant to self-regulation, previous studies on job search have not integrated these important constructs into the dynamic model of job search. Using data from college seniors in China, the current study advanced {{the understanding of the}} dynamic pathways leading to job search behaviors and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> job <b>offers.</b> Specifically, conceptualizing job search behaviors as guided by the employment goal and its sub-goal job search behavior goal, the current study differentiates employment self-efficacy from job search behavior self-efficacy. The data showed that at the within-person level, higher levels of perceived job search progress lead to more job search behaviors through enhanced levels of job search behavior self-efficacy. At the same time, higher levels of perceived job search progress could also lead to less job search behaviors through elevated employment self-efficacy. Finally, active job search behaviors were positively related to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> job <b>offers</b> <b>received</b> by job seekers. The data also suggest that performance goal orientation and attribution moderated the within-person relationship between perceived job search progress and self-efficacy believes. These findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical implications to multiple goal theories regarding dynamic self-regulation processes and practical implications to employment interventions...|$|R

Hence, {{in order to}} calculate the expected variance for the learning model, where the underlying assumption is that ex ante job quality is not observable, we need to infer the true job offer distribution (i.e. including those offers which were worse than the offer that was accepted) that underlies the observed accepted job offer distribution among labor market entrants. This can easily be done using an optimization program (e.g. in MATLAB) that simulates the true job offer distribution and the true <b>number</b> <b>of</b> job <b>offers</b> that people <b>receive</b> in a certain period such {{that the combination of}} both - given the assumption that people can pick the best available offer - would lead to a simulated accepted job offer distribution, which best approximates the observed accepted job offer distribution in Figure  220. As can be seen in Figure  2 the simulated accepted job offer distribution, which has a mean of 4.67 and a standard deviation of 2.37, makes a rather good fit to the observed distribution <b>of</b> accepted job <b>offers.</b> This is based on the simulated <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>offers</b> each person <b>receives</b> in a period being equal to two. Now, the simulated true job offer distribution is used to calculate the expected variance following the learning model, which is presented in Figure  3. Since the stepping stone model and the learning model represent both ends of a continuum, it is not surprising to find the actual variance in Figure  3 to be in between both extreme variance predictions.|$|R
