5|$|In the maximum-2-satisfiability problem (MAX-2-SAT), {{the input}} is a formula in conjunctive <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> with two literals per clause, {{and the task}} is to {{determine}} the maximum number of clauses that can be simultaneously satisfied by an assignment.

5|$|Resolution, {{a method}} for {{combining}} pairs of constraints to make additional valid constraints, also leads to a polynomial time solution.

5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph.

An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E

This paper provides a study of <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> for some prominent logics for default reasoning.

5|$|Instances of the 2-satisfiability problem are {{typically}} expressed as Boolean formulas {{of a special}} type, called conjunctive <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> (2-CNF) or Krom formulas. Alternatively, they may be expressed as a special type of directed graph, the implication graph, which expresses the variables of an instance and their negations as vertices in a graph, and constraints on pairs of variables as directed edges. Both {{of these kinds of}} inputs may be solved in linear time, either by a method based on backtracking or by using the strongly connected components of the implication graph.|$|E

For instance, the Goron and Zora are allowed to exit Clock Town at will, whereas the Deku Scrub is not permitted to leave by reason of his childlike appearance.

For example, Link's <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> receives an indifferent response from dogs, Deku Link is attacked by them, Goron Link frightens them, and Zora Link makes them chase him happily.|$|E
5|$|Research into fungal prions {{has given}} strong {{support to the}} protein-only concept, since {{purified}} protein extracted from cells with a prion state has been demonstrated to convert the <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> of the protein into a misfolded form in vitro, and in the process, preserve the information corresponding to different strains of the prion state. It has also {{shed some light on}} prion domains, which are regions in a protein that promote the conversion into a prion. Fungal prions have helped to suggest mechanisms of conversion that may apply to all prions, though fungal prions appear distinct from infectious mammalian prions in the lack of cofactor required for propagation. The characteristic prion domains may vary between species—e.g., characteristic fungal prion domains are not found in mammalian prions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGraph groups admit a (finite) {{presentation}} {{in which each}} relation is of the form xy = yx for generators x and y. While the two extreme cases of graph groups, free groups and free abelian groups, have been previously shown to be bicombable (in fact, biautomatic), neither of the <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> typically used for the combings generalize successfully to arbitrary graph groups. The <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> presented here which do yield results for arbitrary graph groups utilize {{the concept of a}} “commuting clique” of generators, and when these <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> are applied to free abelian groups, they differ from the “usual” <b>normal</b> <b>forms.</b> As the set of <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> is a regular language over the free monoid on the set of generators and their formal inverses, it follows that graph groups are biautomatic...|$|R
5|$|The {{protein that}} prions {{are made of}} (PrP) is found {{throughout}} the body, even in healthy people and animals. However, PrP found in infectious material has a different structure and is resistant to proteases, the enzymes in the body that can normally break down proteins. The <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> of the protein is called PrPC, while the infectious form is called PrPSc— the C refers to 'cellular' PrP, while the Sc refers to 'scrapie', the prototypic prion disease, occurring in sheep. While PrPC is structurally well-defined, PrPSc is certainly polydisperse and defined at a relatively poor level. PrP can be induced to fold into other more-or-less well-defined isoforms in vitro, {{and their relationship to}} the form(s) that are pathogenic in vivo is not yet clear.|$|E

In each two-measure line {{during the first half}} of the verses, Stefani descends the scale while the keyboard plays the off-beats of the first measure and the electric bass opens the line with a two-note bassline. During the second half of the verses, Stefani's vocals are overdubbed, and the instrumentation becomes more frequent. Each of the two verses is followed by the chorus, where overdubbing is used on Stefani's vocals to produce first inversion and <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> E minor chords. Bounty Killer then toasts the bridge, and after a brief section sung by Stefani, the song closes by repeating the chorus twice.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} Pokémon {{are capable of}} {{evolving}} into a larger and more powerful creature. The change is accompanied by stat changes, generally a modest increase, and access to {{a wider variety of}} attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger an evolution including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a specific attack. For example, at level 16 Bulbasaur is capable of evolving into Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee is capable of evolving into eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In Generation VI, a new mechanic called Mega Evolution—as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called Primal Reversion—was introduced into the game. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> at the end. Forty-eight Pokémon are capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or Primal Reversion as of the release of Sun and Moon. In contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes that may provide stat buffs or changes and type alterations but are not considered new species.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> of nonautonomous {{differential}} systems. For doing so, we first investigate the nonuniform dichotomy spectrum of the linear evolution operators that admit a nonuniform exponential dichotomy, where the linear evolution operators are defined by nonautonomous differential equations ẋ=A(t) x in ^n. Using the nonuniform dichotomy spectrum we obtain the <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> of the nonautonomous linear differential equations. Finally we establish the finite jet <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> of the nonlinear differential systems ẋ=A(t) x+f(t,x) in ^n, which is based on the nonuniform dichotomy spectrum and the <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> of the nonautonomous linear systems.

40|$|Summary. Spiking neural P {{systems are}} {{computing}} devices recently introduced {{as a bridge}} between spiking neural nets and membrane computing.

We study combinations of existing <b>normal</b> <b>forms,</b> showing that certain groups of them can be combined without loss of computational power, thus answering partially open problems stated in [8, 9]. We also extend some of the already known <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> for spiking neural P systems considering determinism and strong acceptance condition. <b>Normal</b> <b>forms</b> can speed-up development and simplify future proofs in this area. ...|$|R
5|$|The Nintendo 64 version {{features}} two game types: Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch, {{where the}} objective is to kill as many opposing players as possible; and Frag Tag, in which one random player is transformed into a monkey with no attacks and very little health. The monkey's task is to go to a specific point to return to their <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> and transform another random player into the monkey. Players gain points by killing the monkey and lose points if they die as the monkey. The Microsoft Windows version features three game types: Rok Match, which is the same as Deathmatch; Arena, where two players or teams must battle against each other in an arena setting. The winning player or team will have to face a new opponent. If the player or team loses, they will have to get in line and wait for their next turn to fight again; and Capture the Flag, where the goal is to capture opposing flags and return it to a team's base.|$|E
25|$|Applicative {{order is}} not a {{normalising}} strategy. The usual counterexample is as follows: define Ω = ωω where ω = λx.xx. This entire expression contains only one redex, namely the whole expression; its reduct is again Ω. Since {{this is the only}} available reduction, Ω has no <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> (under any evaluation strategy). Using applicative order, the expression KIΩ = (λx.λy.x) (λx.x)Ω is reduced by first reducing Ω to <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> (since it is the rightmost redex), but since Ω has no <b>normal</b> <b>form,</b> applicative order fails to find a <b>normal</b> <b>form</b> for KIΩ.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, both {{strongly}} normalising {{terms and}} weakly normalising terms {{have a unique}} <b>normal</b> <b>form.</b> For strongly normalising terms, any reduction strategy is guaranteed to yield the <b>normal</b> <b>form,</b> whereas for weakly normalising terms, some reduction strategies may fail to find it.|$|E
40|$|Term rewrite {{systems are}} useful {{in many areas of}} {{computer}} science. Two especially important areas are decision procedures for the word problem of some algebraic systems and rule-based programming. One of the most studied properties of rewrite systems is confluence, and one of the primary benefits of having a confluent rewrite system is that the system also has uniqueness of <b>normal</b> <b>forms.</b> However, uniqueness of <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> is an interesting property in its own right and well studied. Also, confluence can be too strong a requirement for applications. In this paper, we study the decidability of uniqueness of <b>normal</b> <b>forms.</b> Uniqueness of <b>normal</b> <b>forms</b> is decidable for ground rewrite systems, but is undecidable in general.
