This work is focused on current and controversial issues <b>of</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution, part in light of obligatory reasons (generally defined in § 172 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Code), part in light of facultative reasons <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution (§ 172 paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure). At the same time is pointed to the controversial problems in theory of interpretation. This contrariety arising out of the adoption of the new Penal Code (Act No. 40 / 2009 Coll.).

40|$|Results of many {{previous}} {{studies on the}} rate of small business failure suggest an inverse relationship between size of business and propensity to fail. However, {{it has been suggested}} that this inverse relationship, between firm size and the rate <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance,</b> may more accurately be characterized as an inverse relationship between age of business and the rate <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance.</b> While some studies have confirmed the positive association between failure and age, they have generally found that a size effect persists even after controlling for age. The central objective of this study is to show how reported failure rates may depend heavily on the definition of failure adopted, and to examine the proposition that the results of {{previous studies}} reporting a negative association between propensity to fail and business size may have been driven by the choice of failure definition...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to understand}} why individuals stop using products and what impact their decision to do so has on the subsequent sales/diffusion of the product in question. In keeping with this objective, a theory <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance</b> (or disadoption) is developed within the overall diffusion paradigm. The discontinuance pattern, {{in conjunction with the}} diffusion pattern, enables the determination of the actual size of the active user base at any given point in the life-cycle. This is of greater importance than the cumulative number of initial adopters because the active users of a product are more likely to initiate positive word of mouth about the product than those who have discontinued. In addition, active users are also likely to be the repeat purchasers of a product. ^ Based on this theory, four types <b>of</b> <b>discontinuances</b> [...] replacement, disenchantment, underutilization, and snob [...] are identified, and their impact on the subsequent diffusion (sales) of a product examined both at the aggregate level (e. g., negative impact on subsequent adoption) as well as the individual decision level (e. g., stages of the discontinuance-decision process for different types of discontinuers). ^ To test this theory empirically, data collected from subscribers of computer-based online network services were analyzed. Results support the notion that individuals who discontinue because of disenchantment are more likely to initiate negative word-of-mouth which, subsequently, could manifest itself in a retarded diffusion pattern. The notion that different types of discontinuers behave differently with respect to the discontinuance-decision process is also largely supported. ^ The managerial implications of this dissertation are substantiial, especially with regard to: (1) the negative effect <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance</b> on sales, profits, and image, (2) methods to control discontinuance, (3) situations in which discontinuance is likely to be high, and (4) the types <b>of</b> <b>discontinuances</b> that are likely to be the most detrimental to subsequent sales of a new product. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the latter}} half in 1990 's, the {{extensive}} public policies for promoting newly establishment of the enterprise (for example, "Law for facilitating the creation of New Business" enforced in 1999) were introduced in Japan. In this paper, I would like to search the theoretical background of such policy as the policy for promoting evolution of industry that the innovative activities were accompanied by newly establishment and <b>discontinuance</b> ofbusiness <b>of</b> the enterprise. To begin with, I carried out the fact finding on the relation between newly establishment and <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> business using the data of "The 1999 Establishment and Enterprise Census. " And I verified some hypotheses {{on the evolution of}} industries which Acs and Audretsch (1991) and Audretsch (1995) presented and tried the reexamination of these hypotheses. I set the increasing rate of newly establishment (the number of employee base) and the increasing rate <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> business (the number of employee base) during 1996 - 1999 period as main variables. I carried out the regression analysis on manufacturing industries and service industries (industrial classification of 2 and 3 digits), and confirmed that there was the positive correlation between the increasing rate of newly establishment and the increasing rate <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> business. I examined the ratio of increasing rate <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> business and increasing rate of newly establishment (D / E ratio) on enterprise scale (by the number of employee base) and industrial sector (industrial classification of 2 digits). As the result, I confirmed that the D / E ratio described the V-shaped curve with the extension of enterprise scale in many industrial sectors. I consider that the base point of this V-shaped curve shows minimum efficient scale. I confirmed that there was the positive correlation between this minimum efficient scale (D / E ratio at V-shaped base point) and employment increasing rate of the industrial sector. Based on these results of analysis, I describe some policy implications on the public policies for the newly establishment of enterprises and the initial support and growth support for the newly-established and smallscale enterprises...|$|R

40|$|The master thesis {{addresses}} the institute <b>of</b> the conditional <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution. Being {{one part of}} divergences, the core <b>of</b> the conditional <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution lays in temporally suspension of further criminal proceeding with a premise of its definitive suspension if the legal requirements are met. Except for the introductory part and the conclusion, the thesis {{is divided into three}} main chapters. The first chapter is devoted to the concept of restorative justice and deals also with a concept of divergences. In addition to the definition of the divergence the thesis addresses adequately particular types of divergences as they appear in Czech criminal proceedings. The core of the thesis shall be found in the chapter number two, which provides {{a closer look at the}} conditional <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution itself. Through all the paragraphs in this chapter the conditions of an application of the conditional suspension, the course of the probation period and particularities of this proceeding are being dealt with.

40|$|The study {{highlighted}} some of {{the development}} challenges facing South Africa. These include high levels of unemployment, poverty and income inequality. The objective {{of the study is}} to examine the critical role that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play in alleviating {{some of the}} development challenges facing South Africa. SMEs are expected to be an important vehicle to address the challenges of job creation, sustainable economic growth, equitable distribution of income and the overall stimulation of economic development in South Africa. The study finds that the perception of entrepreneurial opportunities and capabilities has increased since 2001 but still relatively low by international standard. In addition, the rate of business establishment is much lower than the rate <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance.</b> There is a net loss of small businesses. These factors may negatively impact on the ability of SMEs to help in alleviating some of the development challenges facing South Africa. Policy measures to improve the low rate of business establishment and reduce the high rate <b>of</b> <b>discontinuance</b> are <b>of</b> critical and urgent importance in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|Conditional <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> {{criminal}} prosecution is an institute that was introduced into Czech {{criminal procedure law}} {{more than twenty years}} ago. Over the years, this alternative way of handling criminal cases has become the most commonly used (in the last four years, the second most commonly used) means of all alternative ways called diversions. This diversion is used by both prosecutors and courts in cases of less serious criminal offenses. The point <b>of</b> conditional <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> {{criminal prosecution}} is the decision of the prosecutor or the court not to initiate criminal court proceedings or cease them under certain conditions, the most important of them being the offender reimbursing the injured party for the damages caused by the crime. The goal of the author of this thesis is to briefly write about the history of alternative ways of handling criminal cases and their introduction into Czech criminal law, then to move on to specifically discussing the institute <b>of</b> conditional <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution, the conditions that must be met for its use, the benefits it brings into Czech criminal law and criminal proceedings and to compare it with other types of diversions, {{as well as with the}} use of the same institute in Slovak criminal law under slightly different conditions.
