5|$|Additional {{studies of}} {{different}} groups in Wilhelmine Germany have all {{contributed to a}} <b>new</b> <b>view</b> of the period. Although the Junkers did, indeed, continue to control the officer corps, they did not dominate social, political, and economic matters {{as much as the}} Sonderweg theorists had hypothesized. Eastern Junker power had a counterweight in the western provinces {{in the form of the}} Grand Bourgeoisie and in the growing professional class of bureaucrats, teachers, professors, doctors, lawyers, scientists, etc.|$|E
5|$|David E. Starkey and {{collaborators}} advanced a <b>new</b> <b>view</b> of the subspecies in 2003. Based on a {{study of}} the mitochondrial DNA, they rejected the glacial development theory and argued that the southern painted turtle should be elevated to a separate species, C. dorsalis, while the other subspecies should be collapsed into one and not differentiated. However, this proposition was largely unrecognized because successful breeding between all subspecies was documented wherever they overlapped. Nevertheless, in 2010, the IUCN recognized both C. dorsalis and C.p.dorsalis as valid names for the southern painted turtle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Refactoring is {{the process}} of {{changing}} the structure of code without changing its behavior. Refactoring can be semi-automated with the help of tools, but many existing tools do a poor job of communicating errors triggered by the programmer. This poor communication causes programmers to refactor slowly, conservatively, and incorrectly. In this paper, I demonstrate the problems with current refactoring tools, characterize three <b>new</b> alternative program <b>views</b> to assist in refactoring, and describe a user study that compares these <b>new</b> <b>views</b> against existing tools. The results of the study show that both the speed and accuracy of refactoring can be increased using these <b>new</b> <b>views.</b> The <b>new</b> <b>views</b> exhibit several desirable properties for future refactoring tools. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1708, E. Hatton {{recorded}} the inscription below the clock as Ex hoc Momento pendat Eternitas in his <b>New</b> <b>View</b> of London {{and did not}} mention a figure above it. The date 1715 is shown on the clock-case in the 1717 volume of Vitruvius Britannicus, so perhaps indicates the clock had been replaced and the inscription changed to Sic transit gloria mundi as shown here.|$|E
5|$|Summerhill: A Radical Approach to Child Rearing is a {{book about}} the English {{boarding}} school Summerhill School by its headmaster A. S. Neill. It is known for introducing his ideas to the American public. It was published in America on November 7, 1960, by the Hart Publishing Company and later revised as Summerhill School: A <b>New</b> <b>View</b> of Childhood in 1993. Its contents are a repackaged collection from four of Neill's previous works. The foreword was written by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, who distinguished between authoritarian coercion and Summerhill.|$|E
5|$|The most {{sensitive}} enzyme assays use lasers focused through a microscope to observe changes in single enzyme molecules as they catalyse their reactions. These measurements either use {{changes in the}} fluorescence of cofactors during an enzyme's reaction mechanism, or of fluorescent dyes added onto specific sites of the protein to report movements that occur during catalysis. These studies are providing a <b>new</b> <b>view</b> of the kinetics and dynamics of single enzymes, as opposed to traditional enzyme kinetics, which observes the average behaviour of populations of millions of enzyme molecules.|$|E

5|$|In the arts, Romanticism {{manifested}} itself in literature and drama in {{the adoption of the}} mythical bard Ossian, the exploration of national poetry in the work of Robert Burns and in the historical novels of Walter Scott. Scott also had a major impact on the development of a national Scottish drama. Art was heavily influenced by Ossian and a <b>new</b> <b>view</b> of the Highlands as the location of a wild and dramatic landscape. Scott profoundly affected architecture through his re-building of Abbotsford House in the early nineteenth century, which set off the boom in the Scots Baronial revival. In music, Burns was part of an attempt to produce a canon of Scottish song, which resulted in a cross fertilisation of Scottish and continental classical music, with romantic music becoming dominant in Scotland into the twentieth century.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, a labiaplasty surgeon {{can earn}} up to $250,000 a month. Simone Weil Davis, {{professor}} of American studies, told Shameless magazine in 2005 that surgeons are perpetuating {{the idea that}} there is a right way for women's genitalia to look; because most women see only their own vaginas or pornographic images, it is easy to make them doubt themselves. The feminist organization, the <b>New</b> <b>View</b> Campaign, has spoken out against the existence of unregulated cosmetic surgery clinics as business enterprises, which it says trade on women's sexuality by appealing to their low self-esteem, thereby creating health risks.|$|E

25|$|According to Thomas Powers, {{the author}} of Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, the more Oughton learned about the hard life of rural Guatemala, the more she {{reflected}} on the affluence of the United States. In Chichicastenango, Americans seemed an alien presence; the fact of their wealth was almost {{an insult to the}} impoverished Indians. In her mind, confusion emerged that lasted the rest of her life: she had rejected affluence (at first almost unconsciously) to work among the poor, but poverty, clearly, was nothing to be envied. She hated poverty, but she hated affluence, too. Oughton left Chichicastenango with a <b>new</b> <b>view</b> of the problems that undeveloped countries like Guatemala faced when in struggle with the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, James L. Calderwood {{offered a}} <b>new</b> <b>view</b> {{on the role}} of Oberon. He viewed the king as specialising in the arts of illusion. Oberon, in his view, is the {{interior}} dramatist of the play, orchestrating events. He is responsible for the play's happy ending, when he influences Theseus to overrule Egeus and allow the lovers to marry. Oberon and Theseus bring harmony out of discord. He also suggested that the lovers' identities, which are blurred and lost in the forest, recall the unstable identities of the actors who constantly change roles. In fact the failure of the artisans' play is based on their chief flaw as actors: they can not lose their own identities to even temporarily replace them with those of their fictional roles.|$|E
25|$|A <b>new</b> <b>view</b> is {{developing}} that the regional tectonic boundary is not under Hood Canal, {{but just to}} the west, involving the Saddle Mountain fault zone (discussed below) and associated faults. This is supported by geologically recent scarps and other signs of active faulting on the Saddle Mountain faults, and also discovery of a geophysical lineament running through Pleasant Harbor (south of Brinnon) that appears to truncate strands of the Seattle Fault. In this view Hood Canal is only a syncline (dip) between the Olympic Mountains and the Puget Lowland, and such faults as have been found there are local and discontinuous, ancillary to the main zone of faulting to the west. North of the Seattle Fault accommodation of regional movement may be along the northwest-striking Dabob Bay Fault Zone.|$|E

25|$|Also {{writing in}} 1971, Hugh M. Richmond offered an entirely <b>new</b> <b>view</b> of the play's love story lines. He argued that {{what passes for}} love in this play is {{actually}} a self-destructive expression of passion. He argued that the play's significant characters are all affected by passion and by a sadomasochistic type of sexuality. This passion prevents the lovers from genuinely communicating with each other. At {{the same time it}} protects them from the disenchantment with the love interest that communication inevitably brings. The exception to the rule is Bottom, who is chiefly devoted to himself. His own egotism protects him from feeling passion for anyone else. Richmond also noted that there are parallels between the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe, featured in this play, and that of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{relatively}} limited developments in recent empirical research, theoretical debates in sociology of law {{have been important}} in British literature during recent decades, with contributions from David Nelken exploring the problems of a comparative sociology of law and {{the potential of the}} idea of legal cultures, Roger Cotterrell seeking to develop a <b>new</b> <b>view</b> of the relations of law and community to replace what he sees as outdated 'law and society' paradigms, and other scholars, such as David Schiff and Richard Nobles, examining the potential of Luhmannian systems theory {{and the extent to which}} law can be seen as an autonomous social field rather than as intimately interrelated with other aspects of the social. Also significant has been the burgeoning field of socio-legal research on regulation and government, to which British scholars have been prominent contributors.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the mid-1930s, the Yale University scholar Stanley Williams {{supervised}} {{more than}} a dozen dissertations on Melville that were eventually published as books. Where the first wave of Melville scholars focused on psychology, Williams' students were prominent in establishing Melville Studies as an academic field concerned with texts and manuscripts, tracing Melville's influences and borrowings (even plagiarism), and exploring archives and local publications. Jay Leyda, known for his work in film, spent {{more than a}} decade in archives and small-town libraries gathering documents and records for a day by day record, published as Melville Log (1951). Sparked by Leyda, {{the second phase of the}} Melville Revival emphasized research rather than accepting Melville's early books as reliable accounts. The post-war scholars tended to think that Weaver, Harvard psychologist Henry Murray, and Mumford favored Freudian interpretations which read Melville's fiction too literally as autobiography; exaggerated his suffering in the family; and mistakenly inferred a homosexual attachment to Hawthorne. They saw a different arc to Melville's writing career. The first biographers saw a tragic withdrawal after the cold critical reception for his prose works and largely dismissed his poetry. A <b>new</b> <b>view</b> emerged of Melville's turn to poetry as a conscious choice that placed him among the most important American poets.|$|E
