50|$|Community {{facilities}} in the wider Broadmeadows area were generally the outcome of community agitation through Progress Associations. The Jacana Progress Association was formed in 1959 and concentrated most of its energies on building a community hall. The Association requested that residents donate two shillings each towards this project, and along {{with a series of}} local carnivals, had raised $2 000 by 1968. As this was insufficient to construct a hall, the Association approached <b>non-government</b> <b>bodies</b> with aspirations to locate in the area. St. John's Ambulance was the successful 'bidder' for this and was given the money towards a hall on land which had been donated by the Housing Commission to the Association. It constructed the Hall in Pascoe Vale Road, for its own and the community's use. The Hall was demolished in 2012.|$|R
40|$|During {{the twentieth}} century in Australia more than half-a-million {{children}} grew up in 'out-of-home' care in over 800 institutions, including children's homes, foster homes, industrial schools and orphanages.

Around 7, 000 children were child migrants from Britain, Ireland and Malta; up to 50, 000 were Indigenous 'Stolen' children and more than 450, 000 were non-Indigenous children. The contributions to this groundbreaking book constitute {{an eclectic mix of}} scholarship drawn from a diverse group of historians, social scientists, artists, performers, freelance writers and stakeholders, including former state wards and Forgotten Australians.

40|$|Family {{learning}} is now acknowledged by both government and <b>non-government</b> <b>bodies</b> {{as being an}} important aspect of lifelong learning. It is of direct relevance to public libraries, yet little information is available about the specific role the public library can play. The main aim of the paper is to investigate the levels and types of current provision in UK public libraries, and to find out what influences the services on offer. In addition, the research tries to establish whether family learning can be of benefit to libraries, and if current provision meets the key recommendations as outlined in recent reports. The majority of library services surveyed offer family learning on a regular basis. Social inclusion, funding and partnership working are key issues, but their influence does vary between library services. Overall library services seem to be making a valuable contribution to family learning, perhaps more so than the literature suggests...|$|R

This portion includes the government retirees who have reached their mandatory retirement age of 56 years old. The objectives of this study are to analyze the retirees’ profiles and skills and to examine their involvement in associations. To elicit data, a total of 1609 questionnaires were gathered and analyzed using SPSS. Findings indicate that most of the retirees have acquired various skills throughout their years of service, especially in the area related to their tasks and responsibilities. However, these retirees were unable to utilize their invaluable skills appropriately. It is therefore of high importance for the government and <b>non-government</b> <b>bodies</b> to develop a proper means for the retirees to utilise their skills.

40|$|Malaysia is {{a country}} that is rich for the {{diversity}} of its people. This diversity {{can be seen from the}} aspect of faith, ethnicity, language, culture, and so on. In facing a society that is pluralistic in nature, several initiatives have been taken by the government and <b>non-government</b> <b>bodies</b> in ensuring understanding and unity among Malaysians. Among the initiatives taken are interreligious dialogues. In this regard, many among Malaysian thinkers have proposed some approaches and concepts of inter-faith dialogue that should and may be implemented in the context of Malaysia. For that purpose, this paper examined the forms of inter-religious dialogues in Malaysia from the perspective of Malaysian contemporary Muslim thinkers. The methodology utilized in this study is textual analysis, particularly the writings of these thinkers on this issue. This article concludes that there are several forms of inter-religious dialogues that are easily implemented, as well as the difficult ones in the context of Malaysia due to certain obstacles...|$|R
