5000|$|Gopichand Malineni and Ravi Teja {{together}} {{announced that}} their collaboration {{is set for}} a new movie whose name was revealed later. In August 2012, {{it was announced that}} the filming would begin from October 2012. The film's muhurtam was held on 26 October 2012 in a quiet ceremony held at producer Potluri's office.Few of the movie's songs were canned in Lisbon of Portugal thus making the first Telugu film being filmed in Portugal. In an interview to the Portugal media, Ravi Teja, Shruti Haasan and Gopichand Malineni thanked the Portugal tourism board and the local crew for their support. In May, Gopichand Malineni responded about the delay in the movie's shooting, stating [...] "Balupu has been delayed due to fight masters and fighters union problems. Now Ram-Laxman masters have got Hyderabad union card and we are on the way." [...] For {{the first time in his}} career, Ravi Teja sung a song thus making this film his Debut as a Singer, adding yet another feather in his cap. As on 4 June, The post-production works were reported to be running in full-swing at a <b>neck</b> <b>break</b> speed.|$|E
30|$|In {{accordance}} with sawtooth-shaped loads observed in experiments [33, 35], the irregular jumps of load–depth curve during unload process {{are shown in}} Fig. 2, as Ni tip is pulled out of Cu substrate. Our displacement-controlled simulation reveals clearly the underlying mechanism of irregular load-jump. We find that two main fracture mechanisms {{are responsible for the}} sawtooth-shaped load: the atomic rearrangement caused by stepped surface at the initial stage of <b>neck</b> <b>break</b> and the shear behavior along the close-packed plane. The two main mechanisms will be discussed in detail in later discussion.|$|E

In the struggle Karp's <b>neck</b> <b>breaks.</b> Hoffmann falsifies the crime scene {{to make it look}} like a suicide. Forensics inform Leclerc, and he deduces that Hoffmann killed him.|$|R
50|$|In July, the {{official}} investigation, {{carried out by}} the same public security bureau that had been harassing Fu, concluded that the attack had been fabricated. Their report states that no other footprints were found around Fu's home and that he must have hit himself {{in the back of the}} <b>neck,</b> <b>breaking</b> three vertebrae and causing partial paralysis.|$|R
50|$|Mbowisa violently gripped de Klerk's <b>neck,</b> <b>breaking</b> several {{bones in}} her throat and causing a blood vessel to burst in her eye. A steak knife was found {{embedded}} in her back and she also suffered several wounds to the head. Mbowisa was acquitted of a rape charge but a pathologist {{was not able to}} rule out penetration.|$|R
60|$|She {{opened her}} cloak, and there upon her breast hung that {{necklace}} which had lain upon the breast of the Wanderer in his tomb, the necklace {{of gold and}} inlaid shells and emerald beetles, only there were two rows of shells and emeralds, not one. One row she unclasped and clasped it again round his <b>neck,</b> <b>breaking</b> the little gold threads that bound the two strands together.|$|R
25|$|Bryson then {{managed to}} escape from the house by jumping from a second floor window, wearing nothing besides a dog collar around his <b>neck,</b> <b>breaking</b> a bone in his foot in the process; he then ran toward a meter reader walking across {{the other side of the}} street, {{shouting}} for this individual to call the police. This individual led Bryson to the house he had been approaching, whereupon the occupants promptly called the police, who arrived minutes later.|$|R

500|$|Jon {{presides over}} the hanging of Ser Alliser Thorne, Olly, Othell Yarwyck, and Bowen Marsh. He takes last words {{from all those}} who {{are about to be}} {{executed}} except from Olly who remains silent. Ser Alliser is unrepentant, declaring only that he did what was right for the Night's Watch, and while he will now be able to rest, Jon will still be fighting the wildlings' battles forever. Jon cuts the rope and the mutineers' <b>necks</b> <b>break.</b> Jon then gives his cloak to Edd, telling him that Castle Black is now his and saying [...] "My watch is ended".|$|R
5000|$|The date of {{execution}} was set for July 25 (July 13 O.S.), 1826. When the executioner attempted to hang the five men, three of them, Muravyov-Apostol, Kakhovsky, and Ryleyev, dropped through the trapdoor {{only to have the}} rope around their <b>necks</b> <b>break.</b> Ryleyev supposedly told the crowd watching the execution that Russia was an [...] "unhappy country, where they don't even know how to hang you." [...] Muravyov-Apostol is said to have made a similar exclamation. The Tsar simply ordered more rope, and the execution was carried out not long after the first attempt. Ryleyev died holding a book of Byron's poetry.|$|R

2500|$|The Times {{correspondent}} {{reported on}} 20 March: [...] "After conviction the wretched woman exhibited strong emotion but this gave {{place in a}} few hours to her habitual cold, reserved demeanour and while she harbours a strong conviction that the royal clemency will be extended towards her, she staunchly asserts her innocence of the crime that she has been convicted of." [...] Several petitions were presented to the Home Secretary, but to no avail. Mary Ann Cotton was hanged at Durham County Gaol on 24 March 1873 by William Calcraft; she died, not from her <b>neck</b> <b>breaking,</b> but by strangulation caused by the rope being rigged too short, possibly deliberately.|$|R

25|$|His {{second test}} {{leads him to}} a vat, {{at the bottom of}} which Judge Halden, who gave Dylan's killer six months in jail, is chained at the neck. Large dead pigs drop into a liquidiser and spray Judge Halden with liquified pig, but Jeff reluctantly sets fire to a cage full of Dylan's toys in order to {{retrieve}} the key (hidden inside one of the many toys) and save Halden. His third test brings him before Timothy Young, Dylan's killer, who is strapped to a machine that will twist his limbs and neck in turn until they break. The key is tied to the trigger of an enclosed shotgun. Jeff eventually tries to free Timothy, but taking the key discharges the shotgun and accidentally kills Halden, and Jeff is unable to stop the machine before Timothy's <b>neck</b> <b>breaks.</b>|$|R
50|$|On October 22, 2001, in a {{match against}} Mammoth Sasaki, Hayabusa {{attempted}} a springboard moonsault - {{one of his}} signature moves - but slipped on the ropes and fell directly on his <b>neck,</b> <b>breaking</b> it and paralyzing him. He retired, but actually regained some control over his legs a year later. By the end of 2001, Arai owed about {{a million dollars to}} influential organizations in Japan, rumored to be connected to the Yakuza (or Japanese Mafia). Realizing that the promotion was going nowhere, he decided to finally close its doors. FMW came to an end with a final show on February 4, 2002 and Shoichi Arai declared FMW bankrupt on February 15, 2002. On May 16, 2002, Arai hanged himself by his tie in a Tokyo park to collect life insurance for his family to pay off his debt to the Yakuza.|$|R

25|$|In 1977, {{there were}} {{allegations}} that the Pinto's structural design allowed its fuel-tank filler <b>neck</b> to <b>break</b> off and the fuel tank to be punctured in a rear-end collision, resulting in deadly fires.

In 1978, all 1971-1976 Pintos were recalled and had safety shielding and reinforcements installed to protect the fuel tank.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most obvious}} {{feature of the}} Acrobatic rock and roll dance are its kicks (into thin air) and its acrobatic {{elements}} like lifts, jumps, throws and flips. Today's rock and roll is focused on show and competition dance and - {{with the exception of}} its name - has nearly nothing in common with the former rock and roll movement. It is danced in pairs or in formation and can even be danced with one male and two females simultaneously which is called [...] "triples". Over the years rock and roll dancing has experienced several important changes: the former 6-basic step was converted into the modern tournament's 9-basic step with its typical kick ball change. Other characteristics are techniques such as the man's body wave movement, that he uses to fling his partner from a sitting position upwards, and the throwing basic movement, where she steps onto his hands and is catapulted upwards into <b>neck</b> <b>breaking</b> jumps. Because of its demanding technique, high speed, and acrobatics, Rock and Roll is a straining high-performance dance and is most often performed by young dancers.|$|R
5000|$|The story {{returns to}} the present, and the rope around Farquhar's <b>neck</b> <b>breaks</b> when he falls from the bridge into the creek. He frees his hands, pulls the noose away, and {{surfaces}} to begin his escape. His senses now greatly sharpened, he dives and swims downstream to avoid rifle and cannon fire. Once {{he is out of}} range, he leaves the creek to begin the journey to his home, 30 miles away. Farquhar walks all day long through a seemingly endless forest, and that night he begins to hallucinate, seeing strange constellations and hearing whispered voices in an unknown language. He travels on, urged by the thought of his wife and children despite the pains caused by his ordeal. The next morning, after having apparently fallen asleep while walking, he finds himself at the gate to his plantation. He rushes to embrace his wife, but before he can do so, he feels a heavy blow upon the back of his neck; there is a loud noise and a flash of white, and [...] "then all is darkness and silence".|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{hydrodynamic}} mechanisms {{involved in the}} motion of the contact line formed at the end region of a liquid filament laying on a planar and horizontal substrate. Since the flow develops under partially wetting conditions, the tip of the filament recedes and forms a bulged region (head), that subsequently develops a neck region behind it. Later on, the <b>neck</b> <b>breaks</b> up leading to a separated drop, {{while the rest of the}} filament restarts the sequence. One main feature of this flow is that the whole dynamics and final drop shapes are strongly influenced by the hysteresis of the contact angle typical in most of the liquid/substrate systems. The time evolution till breakup is studied experimentally and pictured in terms of a hybrid wettability theory which involves the Cox-Voinov hydrodynamic approach combined with the molecular kinetic theory developed by Blake. The parameters of this theory are determined for our liquid/substrate system (silicon oil / coated glass). The experimental results of the retracting filament are described in terms of a simple heuristic model, and also compared with numerical simulations of the full Navier-Stokes equations. This study is of special interest in the context of pulsed laser induce dewetting (PLiD) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{theoretically}} investigate multinucleon transfer (MNT) {{processes in}} ^ 238 U+^ 124 Sn reaction at E_lab= 5. 7 MeV/A using the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. For this reaction, measurements of MNT processes have been reported, showing substantial MNT cross sections accompanying {{more than ten}} protons. From the calculation, {{we find that the}} amount of transferred nucleons depends much on the relative orientation between the deformation axis of ^ 238 U and the relative vector connecting centers of ^ 238 U and ^ 124 Sn nuclei. We find a formation of thick neck when the ^ 238 U collides from its tip with ^ 124 Sn. However, the neck formation is substantially suppressed when ^ 238 U collides from its side. We have found {{that a large number of}} protons are transferred in the tip collision. This is caused by the <b>breaking</b> of the <b>neck</b> and subsequent absorption of nucleons in the neck region. We thus conclude that the measured MNT processes involving about ten protons originate from the <b>neck</b> <b>breaking</b> dynamics in the tip collisions of a deformed ^ 238 U nucleus.
