He started the 2000–01 season well despite <b>not</b> <b>playing</b> every game {{due to his}} lack of fitness, {{but a series of}} niggling injuries and his ongoing depression took him out of the first team picture by Christmas.|$|E

5|$|Nash has {{a medical}} {{condition}} called spondylolisthesis, which causes muscle tightness and back pain. Due to the condition, when he is <b>not</b> <b>playing</b> in basketball games, he lies on his back rather than {{sitting on the bench}} to keep his muscles from stiffening.|$|E

5|$|As Kinkladze was <b>not</b> <b>playing</b> regular {{international}} football when {{he signed}} for Derby, he was not automatically entitled to a work permit, but a review panel gave him special dispensation, due to his previous contribution to English football. He made his debut on 28 November 1999, coming on {{as a substitute for}} Avi Nimni in a 1–2 loss against Arsenal, the first of 14 loan appearances. He scored his first Derby goal on 4 March 2000 in a 4–0 win against Wimbledon. At the end of the season, the loan move was made permanent. The transfer fee of £3 million set a club record that stood until 2007.|$|E

5|$|As {{a fan of}} the National Basketball Association (NBA), Henry {{is often}} seen with his friend Tony Parker at games when <b>not</b> <b>playing</b> football. Henry stated in an {{interview}} that he admires basketball, as it is similar to football in pace and excitement. Having made regular trips to the NBA Finals in the past, he went to watch Parker and the San Antonio Spurs in the 2007 NBA Finals; and in the 2001 NBA Finals, he went to Philadelphia to help with French television coverage of the Finals as well as to watch Allen Iverson, whom he named as one of his favourite players.|$|E
5|$|At his Pro Day workout, Vick ran the 40-yard dash in 4.33 seconds; {{his time}} has been clocked as low as 4.25, which is the fastest-ever for an NFL quarterback. Vick was {{selected}} first in the 2001 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons, becoming the first African-American quarterback to be taken with the top pick. The San Diego Chargers had the number-one selection but traded it to Atlanta Falcons {{the day before the}} draft for the Falcons' first- and third-round picks in 2001. Vick was taken in the 30th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft by the Colorado Rockies, despite <b>not</b> <b>playing</b> baseball since the 8th grade.|$|E

5|$|Halcombe's career {{continued}} {{after that}} time without further throwing controversies, {{but he never}} again threatened for national selection. He was overlooked for selection in the 193031 season, <b>not</b> <b>playing</b> a single first-class match. In the following season, he was only selected for one match, against the touring South Africans, taking 3/114 as the tourists won by an innings and 242 runs. He scored five not out and five respectively.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a member}} of the Washington Light Infantry, a local Washington, D.C. militia, and played in many of their amateur {{baseball}} games throughout his life. When <b>not</b> <b>playing,</b> he tended to his bar. Noted for being a genial, friendly individual, he was quick to make friends, and was a fan-favorite in his hometown of Washington, D.C. Kinslow was a heavy drinker however, which caused him to miss games and team movements on occasion. Late into his career, these alcohol issues were much less tolerated, eventually hastening his exit from the game. He died at the age of 35, after a year-long battle with tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{claim of}} tour harmony and player loyalty in 1948 {{was thrown into}} a {{different}} light by events less than four years later. The opening batsman Sid Barnes—a core member of the 1948 team—was seeking a return to Test cricket. Barnes was known for being a somewhat eccentric self-promoter. During the 1948 tour, Barnes organised a multitude of business deals while <b>not</b> <b>playing</b> cricket, and avoided paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired in Britain by disembarking at Melbourne instead of Sydney.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{skipped the}} World Group 1st round tie against Argentina, over fears he could {{exacerbate}} a knee injury, leaving the British {{team in a}} hopeless situation – they lost 4–1. Jamie was furious that Andy was letting them down and the Murrays would not {{speak to each other}} for two weeks. Seven months later, as the brothers prepared for the tie against Austria, Andy declared that he had healed the rift with Jamie. When Jamie Murray and Ross Hutchins were beaten in the doubles, John Lloyd suffered criticism for <b>not</b> <b>playing</b> Andy. Great Britain lost their World Group play-off to Austria 3–2 and were relegated to Europe/Africa Zone Group I.|$|E
5|$|On a {{personal}} level, Grace was still unqualified {{as a doctor}} and had a growing family to support, his daughter Bessie being born in May. When <b>not</b> <b>playing</b> cricket, he had to study a backlog of medical theory. He did not qualify as a doctor {{until the end of}} the following year. He then needed a practice and this was effectively purchased for him by MCC in 1878 after they launched a National Testimonial on his behalf, though the underlying and hopeful purpose of the appeal was to terminate Grace's embarrassing mercenary activity.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Brand New's {{official}} formation, in {{the late}} 1990s, Jesse Lacey, Garrett Tierney and Brian Lane were {{all members of the}} post-hardcore band The Rookie Lot, along with Brandon Reilly and Alex Dunne of Crime in Stereo. After the band's split and <b>not</b> <b>playing</b> together for a while, Lacey, Lane and Tierney started to rehearse again. After Reilly joined The Movielife, they then recruited guitarist Vincent Accardi, who had been playing in a band called One Last Goodbye.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, {{he was one}} of a few {{managers}} for the Salisbury Pirates. He did <b>not</b> <b>play</b> at {{all that}} year.

Again, in 1951 he did <b>not</b> <b>play</b> at all, as he served as manager of the Granite Falls Graniteers for part of the season.|$|R

Playing in eleven games, Carey scored twice on 43 attempts.|$|E
5|$|Texas' {{defense was}} led by All-American Tony Brackens, who led the Longhorns in sacks (7) and tackles for loss (16) despite <b>not</b> <b>playing</b> three games due to a broken tibia. Brackens also had a blocked kick, five forced fumbles, and five fumble recoveries. Defensive back Chris Carter led Texas in interceptions with six, which he {{returned}} a total of 146 yards. He also had the most pass break-ups on the team with nine. In total tackles, the Longhorns were led by linebacker Tyson King, who had 137—an average of 11.4 tackles per game.|$|E
5|$|The club's {{attempt to}} defend the victory {{came to an end}} after six {{consecutive}} clean sheets, when they were defeated 3–2 by Barnsley with Speirs scoring one of the goals. However, he was limited to ten league games, <b>not</b> <b>playing</b> from September until March, and finished the season with seven goals. They included his second senior hat-trick during a 5–1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday on 30 March 1912. Speirs started the following season, but after playing 13 of the first 15games, he left. He had played 96games in total, scoring 33goals.|$|E
