25|$|On May 28, 1977, the Beverly Hills Supper Club was {{operating}} beyond capacity, {{largely due to}} the popularity of that evening's Cabaret Room show, featuring popular Hollywood singer and actor John Davidson.

According to later estimates based on seating charts and memories of those present, {{the number of people in}} the Cabaret Room at 9:00p.m. on May 28 was somewhere between 900 and 1,300.

Although the floor had a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>exits,</b> including two freight elevators, a fire escape, and stairways down to Greene Street and Washington Place, flames prevented workers from descending the Greene Street stairway, and the door to the Washington Place stairway was locked to prevent theft by the workers; the locked doors allowed managers to check the women's purses. The foreman who held the stairway door key had already escaped by another route. Dozens of employees escaped the fire by going up the Greene Street stairway to the roof.

40|$|Part 2 : Contributed PapersInternational audienceHierarchical graphs {{are used}} in order to {{describe}} systems with a sequential composition of sub-systems. A hierarchical graph consists of a vector of subgraphs. Vertices in a subgraph may “call” other subgraphs. The reuse of subgraphs, possibly in a nested way, causes hierarchical graphs to be exponentially more succinct than equivalent flat graphs. Early research on hierarchical graphs and the computational price of their succinctness {{suggests that there is}} no strong correlation between the complexity of problems when applied to flat graphs and their complexity in the hierarchical setting. That is, the complexity in the hierarchical setting is higher, but all “jumps” in complexity up to an exponential one are exhibited, including no jumps in some problems. We continue the study of the complexity of algorithms for hierarchical graphs, with the following contributions: (1) In many applications, the subgraphs have a small, often a constant, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> vertices, namely vertices from which control returns to the calling subgraph. We offer a parameterized analysis of the complexity and point to problems where the complexity becomes lower when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> vertices is bounded by a constant. (2) We describe a general methodology for algorithms on hierarchical graphs. The methodology is based on an iterative compression of subgraphs in a way that maintains the solution to the problems and results in subgraphs whose size depends only on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> vertices, and (3) We handle labeled hierarchical graphs, where edges are labeled by letters from some alphabet, and the problems refer to the languages of the graphs...|$|R

25|$|As smoke {{began to}} escape the Zebra Room and drift {{down the hall toward}} other banquet rooms, patrons and {{employees}} in the rooms nearest to the Zebra Room smelled it. The employees began to verbally urge room occupants to leave the building; however, as the sprawling complex lacked an audible fire alarm, those in further-flung rooms had no way to know that there was a fire in the building until an employee walked the length of the building alerting them. Fire investigators later estimated that, once through the northern doors of the Zebra Room, the fire took only two to five minutes to enter the Cabaret Room; as a result, news of the fire and the first of the smoke and flame reached the Cabaret Room, the farthest point from the Zebra Room, nearly simultaneously. By the time busboy Walter Bailey arrived in the Cabaret Room and interrupted the show to order an evacuation at 9:06p.m., there was very little time left for the audience of around a thousand people to make their way through the room's small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>exits.</b> As it spread laterally, the fire also began to spread upwards, engulfing the spiral staircase that would have provided the best exit for those {{on the second floor of}} the building.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the performance of maize hybrids with Bt event MON 810 (Bt-hybrids) against the maize stem borer Busseola fusca (Fuller) in a biosafety greenhouse (BGH) and against the spotted stem borer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) under confined field trials (CFT) in Kenya for three seasons during 2013 – 2014. The study comprised 14 non-commercialized hybrids (seven pairs of near-isogenic Bt and non-Bt hybrids) and four non-Bt commercial hybrids. Each plant was artificially infested twice with 10 first instar larvae. In CFT, plants were infested with C.  partellus 14 and 24 days after planting; in BGH, plants were infested with B.  fusca 21 and 31 days after planting. In CFT, the seven Bt hybrids significantly differed from their non-Bt counterparts for leaf damage, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> holes, percent tunnel length, and grain yield. When averaged over three seasons, Bt-hybrids gave the highest grain yield (9. 7  t ha− 1), followed by non-Bt hybrids (6. 9  t ha− 1) and commercial checks (6  t ha− 1). Bt-hybrids had the least <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> holes and percent tunnel length in all the seasons as compared to the non-Bt hybrids and commercial checks. In BGH trials, Bt-hybrids consistently suffered less leaf damage than their non-Bt near isolines. The study demonstrated that MON 810 was effective in controlling B.  fusca and C.  partellus. Bt-maize, therefore, has great potential {{to reduce the risk of}} maize grain losses in Africa due to stem borers, and will enable the smallholder farmers to produce high-quality grain with increased yield, reduced insecticide inputs, and improved food security...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{potential}} of varietal resistance and intercropping to reduce field infestation of cowpeas by storage bruchids was evaluated in Maiduguri, northeastern Nigeria. Four susceptible varieties of cowpea, Borno brown and Kanannado are land races, while IT 93 - 637 -l and 1 T 89 KD- 374 - 57 are improved varieties developed at International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria were sown both as sole crops and mixed crops with pearl millet (var. Ex-borno). The trial was {{conducted during the}} 2001 cropping season and repeated in the 2002 cropping season. A significantly higher <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eggs were laid on pods of IT 93 - 637 -l sown both as a sole crop and intercrop. IT 89 KD- 374 - 57 pods obtained from {{either of the two}} cropping systems bore significantly higher <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> holes <b>of</b> F adult bruchids than pods of Borno brown or 1 T 93 - 637 - 1. 1 However, sole Kanannado seed bore significantly higher <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> holes <b>of</b> F adult bruchids than any of 1 the other varieties sown as a monocrop, hence a significantly higher <b>number</b> <b>of</b> F adult emergence. In 2002, 10652 adult bruchids emerged from seeds of the four cowpea varieties in 2001, 60 % was from the monocrop and 40 % from the intercrop. Related figures for 2002, are 1021 with 50. 2 and 49. 8 % for the monocrop and intercrop, respectively. Callosobruchus rhodesianus, C. maculatus, C. chinensis and Bruchidius atrolineatus constituted 29. 4, 33. 1, 9. 4 and 28. 2 % respectively, of the total F adult bruchids.

40|$|Detailed {{knowledge}} on habitat requirements {{is a key}} to successful conservation actions. The marbled jewel beetle Poecilonota variolosa (Buprestidae) has a wide global distribution but populations are often scarce and typically fragmented. In Sweden it is monophagous on aspen Populus tremula and is classified as near threatened on the Swedish Red List due to its rapid population decline. This study aimed to investigate habitat preferences and regional-scale distribution patterns of P. variolosa in southern Sweden in order to suggest conservation measures. Aspen trees in four study areas in the province of Småland were surveyed for exit holes during late summer 2011. The occurrence and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> holes (both new and old ones) per tree were compared between study areas and habitat types, and were related to the sun exposure and bark thickness of individual trees. Further, the occurrence of new and older exit holes was related to tree sun exposure and bark thickness. The most preferred habitat types were aspens on clear-cuts, followed by roadside aspens, aspens in pastures, and aspens in closed forest. Thick bark and high sun exposure were consistently significant as predictors for both occurrence and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> new <b>exit</b> holes per tree. The majority <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> holes were located towards south. Our results indicate several useful management measures: to retain aspen on clear-cuts, to cut alongside roads and around some selected coarse aspens in closed forests and in pastures...|$|R
