Controlling interference from reflected light results in the etching of a sharper line with less variability.

50|$|Developable bottom antireflective {{coatings}} (DBARC) {{and bottom}} antireflectant coatings (BARCs) {{are made of}} cross-linkable polymers that can minimize back-reflection of light {{during the process of}} etching the wafer surface.

Several approaches to efficiently inhibit the solubility of this polymer are described. Besides functionalisation of the polymer by copolymerisation with hydrophobic, photoactive o-nitrobenzylesters or, respectively, partial reaction of the phenolic hydroxyl groups with dihydropyran, low molecular, acid sensitive solubility inhibitors in combination with photochemical acid generating agents as well as sulfonium salts containing the functions of photochemical acid generation and acid labile groups in the same molecule were tested. Copolymers with o-nitrobenzylic esters satisfy all requirements for deep UV resists except that of high light sensitivity; only in combination with <b>novolaks</b> though, the solubility inhibiting effect yields satisfactory results. All other approaches lead to deep UV photoresists with high photosensitivity (< 100 mJ/cm" 2 and high resolution (< 0. 5 mm). In technological testing the resist based on sulfonium salts exhibited good stability against chlorine or fluorine etching processes and - as a side result - its general aptitude for X-ray lithography. Computer aided simulation was used to support the lithographic process steps of exposure and development. The objective was to generate models describing the reaction kinetics during exposure and development {{in order to be}} able to simulate the whole lithographic process.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{smaller and more}} uniform {{features}} on photomasks has inspired consideration of a DUV (257 nm) resist process for optical pattern generation. Chemically amplified resists require storage and exposure in carbon filtered environments, and they require post-exposure bakes.

Hence, {{it is appropriate to}} explore the lithographic performance of non-chemically amplified resist materials for 257 nm laser photomask lithography. Resist characterization and lithography simulation were used to formulate a 257 nm resist from DNQ / <b>novolak</b> materials provided by a commercial resist supplier. Diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) / <b>novolak</b> resists have not been used for DUV Integrated Circuit (IC) applications mainly due to the low sensitivity and the strong absorbance of the DNQ photoactive compound (PAC) at 248 nm. However, a 2, 1, 4 DNQ based resist has been characterized that bleaches at 257 nm and inhibits <b>novolak.</b> The photoproduct of the 2, 1, 4 DNQ PAC is much more transparent at 257 nm than 248 nm. <b>Novolak</b> resin also has an absorbance minimum in the DUV at 257 nm that provides transparency similar to poly (hydroxystyrene).

Ein Reaktionsmechanismus wird vorgestellt. Eine Reihe von aromatischen Aziden und Bisaziden wurden synthetisiert und spektroskopisch charakterisiert. Die Vergrößerung des konjugierten -Systems im Molekül durch die Einführung entsprechender Gruppen zwischen den beiden Phenylringen zeigt sich in der bathochromen Verschiebung der langwelligsten Absorptionsbande zur i-Linie (365 nm) der Quecksilberbestrahlungsquelle. Gleichzeitig wird die Quantenausbeute der Photolyse der Azidgruppen in ein Nitren unter Abspaltung von molekularem Stickstoff reduziert. Novolakdimere und Trimere wurden als Modellverbindungen für ein <b>Novolak</b> mit geringem Molekulargewicht synthetisiert. Struktur-Eigenschafts-Beziehungen dieser Oligomere wurden durch den Einsatz von spektroskopischen und chromatographischen Methoden aufgestellt. Die Photolyse aller untersuchten Bisazide erfolgt ausschließlich biphotonisch, d. h. die Abspaltung der beiden Stickstoffmoleküle erfolgt sequentiell durch die Absorption von zwei Photonen. Die Hauptreaktionsprodukte der in der Novolakmatrix photolytisch generierten Nitrene sind erstens, die primären Amine Aminoazid und Diamin. Zweitens, entstehen sekundäre Amine durch die H-Abstraktion der Nitrene an den Methylenbrücken vom Novolakoligomer und der anschließenden Rekombination der gebildeten Imino- und Kohlenstoffradikale. Aus der Wasserstoffabstraktion der Nitrene an den Hydroxygruppen vom <b>Novolak</b> resultiert die Bildung von Chinoniminderivaten. Die Rekombination von Oligomerradikalen führt zu einem <b>Novolak</b> mit erhöhtem Molekulargewicht. Durch die Anwendung von chromatographischen und spektroskopischen Methoden und der Synthese von Modellverbindungen wurde sowohl die Bildung der Aminoazide in der photochemischen Reaktion der Bisazide, als auch die Reaktion der Nitrene an den Hydroxygruppen des Novolakes erstmalig bewiesen. In {{this thesis}} {{experimental}} {{investigations of the}} reactions of aromatic nitrenes and bisnitrenes generated by photolysis of azides and bisazides in a <b>novolak</b> matrix are presented and a reaction mechanism is proposed. Various bisazides and aminoazides were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods. The extension of the conjugated -system in the molecules attained by introducing appropriate linkage groups between the two phenyl rings is reflected by a bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum towards the i-line (365 nm) of the mercury lamp. At {{the same time the}} quantum yield of the photolysis of the azido group leading to a nitrene by extrusion of molecular nitrogen (N 2) is reduced. <b>Novolak</b> dimers and trimers used as model compounds for low molecular weight novolaks were synthesized. The relationship between structure and properties of these oligomers was established by means of spectroscopic and chromatographic methods. The photolysis of all investigated bisazides exclusively proceeds by a biphotonic mechanism, i. e. the two nitrogen molecules are sequentially extruded by absorption of two photons. Main reaction products of the photochemically generated nitrenes in the <b>novolak</b> matrix are firstly, the corresponding primary amines, aminoazides and diamines. Secondly, secondary amines are formed by hydrogen abstraction of the nitrenes from the methylene bridges and subsequent recombination of the formed imino radical and the carbon radical. The hydrogen abstraction from the hydroxy group of the <b>novolak</b> oligomers results in the formation of quinonimine derivatives. Recombination of the polymer radicals leads to novolaks with increased molecular weight.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} flame-retardant binding agents {{for the production}} of base material (laminates) of high quality for printed circuit boards. The binding agents represent a single-component system consisting of a mixture of diandicyanate prepolymers (binding time 4 to 8 hours), dianepoxy resin (epoxide equivalent 170 to 400), a mixture (epoxide equivalent 300 to 400, bromine content 37 to 49 percent by weight) consisting of <b>novolak</b> epoxy resin and tetrabromine dianepoxy resin and their conversion products comprising tetrabromodiane, and diane and/or tetrabromodiane, {{in the form of a}} solution, comprising a solids content of 20 to 80 percent by weight, in an organic solvent or solvent mixture, such as aliphatic ketones and/or aromatic hydrocarbons. These flame-retardant binding agents ensure good copper adhesion at 533 K, high storage stability and, high dimensional stability due to the height of their glass transition temperatures and low solvent absorption or swelling in solvent...|$|E

The biopitch from Eucalyptus tar, which has guaiacyl and syringyl units in its molecular structure, exhibits <b>novolak</b> behavior and this phenolic oligomer can be cured with hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA). In this work, mixtures of commercial phenolic resins and Eucalyptus tar pitch were cured and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, elemental and thermogravimetric analyses. Their acetone-in soluble contents were determined and their electrical properties were investigated. The effects of pitch and HMTA contents on phenolic resin properties were modelled using statistical techniques. The regions of optimum formulations were indicated. The results showed that pitch decreases the thermal stability and the acetone-insoluble content of the phenolic blends, whereas HMTA addition had an opposite effect. The statistical model applied indicated that, in terms of acetone-insoluble content, phenolic resin can be substituted for pitch up to a composition of 50 wt%. Electrical studies showed that pitch-phenolic blends have insulating properties...|$|E
