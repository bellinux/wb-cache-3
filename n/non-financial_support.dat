Temporary agency workers keep unique dual ralationships with the user firm and the agency and also show different level of organizational commitment to the user firm and to the agency.

In this thesis, I aimed to investigate temporary agency workers’ dual affective commitment particularly in the South Korean institutional settings. My analysis implied that: (1) temporary agency workers’ affective organizational commitment to the user firm and to the agency would be cooperative rather than competing in general; (2) temporary agency workers would show higher level of affective organizational commitment to the user firm than to the agency; (3) perceived organizational supports from the user firm and from the agency respectively would have a significantly positive relationship with affective organizational commitment to the user firm and to the agency, which was consistent with the social exchange theory.

The limited access to formal value chains for smallholder farmers in South Africa is a key challenge that is facing {{both public and private}} value chain actors. Despite the substantial investments by government, the performance of smallholder farmers in South Africa remains poor. Several studies have been done to understand the key challenges facing smallholder farmer value chain integration. This study takes a unique view by understanding the challenges and opportunities facing farmer integration from a public and private stakeholder perspective, specifically analysing the Western Cape. The study showed that the most influential constraints for smallholder farmer value chain integration are access to informal and formal markets, resources and infrastructure, and the functioning of local institutions. The study also showed that the key opportunities to improve value chain integrations are in improving the <b>non-financial</b> and financial <b>support</b> provided to smallholder farmers.

The Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence is a central component of this technique. This allows for a measure of concomitant ignorance, which may encompass the precision of the individual measurements as well as the possible ambiguity of their influence in the subsequent classification of objects. The level of ignorance present influences the utilisation of the technique as a tool for the ranking or classification of objects. A simplex plot method of representing data allows a clear visual representation (interpretation) to the degree of interaction of the support from the variables to the ranking or classification of the objects. To illustrate the proposed technique, the application considered here is the elucidation of the risk of corporate failure of a number of companies.

40|$|State {{social policy}} has {{numerous}} instruments {{that are designed}} to support families with children 1). There are essentially two basic types: financial instruments (tax deductions, credits, benefits, etc.) and formal, non-financial instruments (such as social recognition of the importance of motherhood and par-enthood). One of the first policy provisions that families with children encounter is maternity leave (ML) and the financial assistance that accompanies it. This policy provision combines both aspects: for-mally expressed recognition of pregnancy and motherhood as important social functions that warrant a special approach, and financial compensation for the temporary loss of employment. According to numerous demographic studies, young people in the Czech Republic are having fewer children than they may originally have planned. It is mainly the socio-economic problems and the gen-erally low support for parenthood in Czech society that tend to interfere with their original fertility plans. The Family and Fertility Survey conducted in 1997 indicates that a full 60 % of women would, in their own opinion, have had the number of children they wanted if there had been supportive pro-family policy provisions in place (Národní koncepce, 2005 : 6).

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: There {{is general}} {{consensus}} that small and {{medium sized enterprises}} (SMEs) play a formidable role in contributing to employment creation, domestic and export earnings, and poverty reduction (OECD, 2004). They are therefore extremely important {{to the development of}} nations (particularly developing countries), as they constitute the bulk of economic contributors outside of agriculture (OECD, 2004). However, SMEs face a number of challenges as they work to realise these important contributions. Aside from the financial constraints that often mar the success rate of SMEs, several non-financial factors hinder their development and their ability to contribute to national development. Non-financial issues include access to markets, technology and training; sectoral support, business networking, and access to information and advice (Thomas, 2003). Based on the important role that SMEs play in developing economies, however, it is crucial that they receive the support needed to help them to succeed, through the provision of business development services. While the financial aspect of SME success is important, their non-financial needs should also be addressed to ensure the holistic survival of SMEs (European Commission, 2009). The role and development of adequate non-financial business development services to either complement financial resources, or to mitigate the lack thereof, is therefore imperative (International Finance Corporation, 2010). This research report explores the gap that currently exists between the financial and non-financial business development services that exist for SMEs in Namibia; and analyses how non-financial services can be enhanced and marketed, to complement financial services that currently exist, and of which SMEs are aware. The report assesses how SMEs can become better aware of, and best utilise business development services to promote their growth objectives. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of SMEs and Business Development Services (BDS) providers in Namibia is conducted, using a survey and questionnaire, and drawing on a literature review. Finally, the report provides a set of recommendations, based on international best practices, of business development instruments needed to transform the SME sector to promote long term sustainability. This research report finds that SMEs need to become better aware and make use of <b>non-financial</b> BDS <b>support</b> to realize the growth objectives of their businesses. The researcher recommends that government and NGOs streamline their support of BDS providers, to being more facilitative and less prescriptive. Additionally, it is recommended that incubation centres adopt best practices in terms of incubator creation, process and performance assessment; that sectoral support and industrial clusters for technical-know-how is promoted; and that BDS suppliers provide context-specific training in order to enhance the effects of training provided. Further recommendations include the promotion of BDS to the general public to increase awareness of the importance of these services; the harnessing of BDS in Namibia’s financial institutions for a more complementary approach; and the formation of a National SME Agency to oversee and facilitate the effective provision of business development services...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{scholars}} {{refrain from}} presenting Carloctavistas as mere puppets {{of the regime}} and acknowledge genuine support the group enjoyed. Some of them, both in Spain and abroad, repeat—with reservations or unconditionally—the thesis of financial support lent by the regime, even as late as in the 1960s. Others perform review of different views and limit themselves to concluding that Francoism either was at least amicably tolerating the Carloctavistas or it was lending them at least <b>non-financial</b> forms of <b>support.</b> The collaborationist Octavista line is presented as genuine. Some {{see it as a}} conscious political strategy, an attempt aimed at gaining room for open activity and possibly using Francoism as a vehicle for crowning a Carlist king. Some see it as rooted in Carloctavista theoretical framework, to a large extent overlapping with the official doctrine, and wrap up by claiming that [...] "with no doubt, Octavism was either Carlism of the Francoists or Francoism of the offshoot Carlists".The thesis of fully autonomous character of Carloctavismo is advanced mostly by its activists or their descendants. They focus on pre-Francoist, Cruzadista origins of Don Carlos' claim, dwell on extended network of his supporters and vehemently deny having accepted financial support from the regime. Authors of major monographs on the movement—two out of three not Carloctavistas themselves though certainly Left-wing sympathizers neither—tend to share this perspective. Their works relate the origins of the movement to profound dynastical crisis within Carlism, later enhanced by political fragmentation and bewilderment of Traditionalism resulting from different strategies adopted towards Francoism. Within this perspective, theoretical outlook of the Octavistas is described as having had little in common with Falangist national-syndicalism and having been rather deeply anchored in Traditionalist thought. One scholar suggests Don Carlos stood a real chance of becoming a king, ruined by his wife, who tarnished his image and deprived him of future male descendency. These authors presents Carloctavista stand versus the so-called Rodeznistas, a collaborative and pro-Juanista branch of Carlism, as vehement opposition. Carloctavista support for the regime is presented as an attempt to outsmart the dictator and use the Francoist political setting for own political goals.|$|R
