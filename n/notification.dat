40|$|This book {{presents}} {{an alternative approach}} to studying smartphone-app user <b>notifications.</b> It starts with insights into user acceptance of mobile <b>notifications</b> {{in order to provide}} tools to support users in managing these. It extends previous research by investigating factors that influence users’ perception of <b>notifications</b> and proposes tools addressing the shortcomings of current systems. It presents a technical framework and testbed as an approach for evaluating the usage of mobile applications and <b>notifications,</b> and then discusses a series of studies based on this framework that investigate factors influencing users’ perceptions of mobile <b>notifications.</b> Lastly, a set of design guidelines for the usage of mobile <b>notifications</b> is derived that can be employed to support users in handling <b>notifications</b> on smartphones...|$|R

5|$|The Windows Push <b>Notification</b> Service (WNS) was {{designed}} as a successor to the Microsoft Push <b>Notification</b> Service (MPNS), which was only supported natively on the Windows Phone 8 Operating System. Developers can still use the MPNS on apps that are installed on newer versions of Windows Mobile (Windows Phone 8 or Windows Phone 8.1), but only if the Windows application was already registered to use the MPNS and has been converted to a Microsoft Silverlight application and modified to re-target the new platform.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Windows Push <b>Notification</b> Service {{is similar to that}} of its predecessor, in that it consists of servers and interfaces that generate, maintain, store, and authenticate unique identifiers (called Channel URI Identifiers) for all devices that register to use the service. When a device enrolls to receive data and <b>notification</b> information using the WNS, it first sends a device registration request to WNS network. The WNS network acknowledges the request, and responds with the device's unique Channel URI Identifier. Typically, the device will then send its identifier to a server owned by the developer so that it can be stored and used for sending notifications. When the app developer wishes to transmit a <b>notification</b> or other WNS data to the device, it will transmit a POST request to the WNS network. The network will acknowledge and authenticate the request. If the authentication succeeds, the data to be transmitted is enqueued and then sent to the device from the WNS network using the Channel URI Identifier.|$|E

5|$|Like other volcanoes in the Anahim Volcanic Belt, the Itcha Range is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system is. The Canadian National Seismograph Network {{has been established}} to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, {{but it is too}} far away to provide an accurate indication of activity under the range. It may sense an increase in seismic activity if the Itcha Range becomes highly restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption; the system might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting. If the Itcha Range were to erupt, mechanisms exist to orchestrate relief efforts. The Interagency Volcanic Event <b>Notification</b> Plan (IVENP) was created to outline the <b>notification</b> procedure of some of the main agencies that would respond to an erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the Canada–United States border or any eruption that would affect Canada.|$|E

40|$|<b>Notifications</b> on {{mobile phones}} alert users about new mes-sages, emails, social network updates, and other events. How-ever, little is {{understood}} {{about the nature}} and effect of such <b>notifications</b> on the daily lives of mobile users. We report from a one-week, in-situ study involving 15 mobile phones users, where we collected real-world <b>notifications</b> through a smartphone logging application alongside subjective percep-tions of those <b>notifications</b> through an online diary. We found that our participants had to deal with 63. 5 <b>notifications</b> on av-erage per day, mostly from messengers and email. Whether the phone is in silent mode or not, <b>notifications</b> were typically viewed within minutes. Social pressure in personal communi-cation was amongst the main reasons given. While an increas-ing number of <b>notifications</b> was associated with an increase in negative emotions, receiving more messages and social net-work updates also made our participants feel more connected with others. Our findings imply that avoiding interruptions from <b>notifications</b> may be viable for professional communi-cation, while in personal communication, approaches should focus on managing expectations...|$|R
