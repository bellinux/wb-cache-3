50|$|There is a {{distinction}} between the <b>nominal</b> <b>gauge</b> and actual gauge at some locality, due to divergence of track components from the nominal. Railway engineers use a device, like a caliper, to measure the actual gauge, and this device is also referred to as a track gauge.|$|E
50|$|Infrastructure owners specify {{permitted}} variances {{from the}} <b>nominal</b> <b>gauge,</b> and the required interventions when non-compliant gauge is detected.

50|$|The <b>nominal</b> track <b>gauge</b> is the {{distance}} between the inner faces of the rails. In current practice, it is specified at a certain distance below the rail head as the inner faces of the rail head (the gauge faces) are not necessarily vertical.|$|R
50|$|Lego Trains is {{a product}} range and theme of the {{construction}} toy Lego, which incorporates buildable train sets. Products in the range have included locomotives, tracks, rolling stock, stations, signal boxes, and other track-side buildings. The theme is popular among adult fans, as well as children, and has spawned international associations and conventions. The train system is {{sometimes referred to as}} 'L-gauge' among fans, in reference to traditional model railway scales. Lego trains use a <b>nominal</b> <b>gauge</b> of 37.5mm, 5.5mm wider than O gauge, derived from a centreline gauge of 40mm (five lego studs).|$|E
5000|$|In railways, {{the most}} {{important}} specification is that of rail gauge, {{the distance between the}} inner surfaces of the heads of the travel rails. Both track and wheel bogies must be built to the same gauge; unless the two fit together within a typical tolerance of 13 mm on the track, the train will either fall off the track or it will be impossible to go through switches or crossovers. However, there is a small tolerance; for example, the Hong Kong MTR [...] gauge EMUs may run on KCR [...] gauge rails (but not vice versa), with a locomotive or a KCR EMU pulling due to different electrification voltages. Another example would be Finno-Russian border: when in the Seventies the Soviet Union redefined the breadth of a Russian gauge from the traditional five feet (1524 mm) to exactly 1520 mm, the Finnish railways stuck with the old value. This did not result in the break-of-gauge because no actual track work was done, as the redefinition was more of a change in the way the tolerances were counted, both railways remained well within tolerances of each other, and several years later Finland also tightened tolerances {{much the same way as}} the USSR did, but without the change to the <b>nominal</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} runs {{were carried out}} on a small blown film line to investigate the effect of processing parameters on the mechanical properties of the film that was produced. Three different dies were used and for each die the throughput (mass flow rate), freeze line height and blow-up ratio were varied, with take-up velocity adjusted to give a fixed <b>nominal</b> <b>gauge</b> (film thickness). One polymer (a low density polyethylene) was used throughout and the extrusion temperature was also kept constant...|$|E
40|$|Commercially {{produced}} {{sheets of}} superplastic grade Al 7475 with various thicknesses have been characterised {{in terms of}} their microstructure and mechanical properties. Gold grids deposited on polished surfaces of tensile specimens were used to measure the surface strains on mesoscopic and microscopic length scales, and fracture surfaces were examined using SEM. The results show that mechanically the alloy behaves like other superplastic materials, with a maximum strain rate sensitivity, m, of 0. 6, and a grain size exponent, p, of 2. 6. Thinner sheets had smaller grain sizes and therefore higher superplastic strain rates. The surface studies showed that the actual strain rate in the gauge length was considerably smaller than the ratio of the crosshead velocity to the <b>nominal</b> <b>gauge</b> length owing to extrusion of material from the gauge head. Evidence for grain boundary sliding and localised tensile separation of material were found. The latter effect was responsible for about 30 % of the strain in the surface. The separated regions were bridged by filaments of similar dimensions to whiskers observed protruding from the fracture surfaces. These whiskers were rich in Mg and were oxidised. It is suggested that the solid oxide layer is responsible for stabilising the filaments against necking...|$|E
5000|$|The {{internal}} quarry tramways {{were laid}} in very light rail suitable for hand working of single wagons.

2500|$|For most {{standardized}} {{model railway}} scales, the nominal scale reduction ratio is not applied systematically {{to all the}} components of a scale model railway, and normally the standards give scale specific design guidelines for all the scales they cover. Reliability of operations requires that certain parts be made oversize. A typical example is the wheel flanges, which must be proportionally higher in smaller scales to ensure that lighter and smaller models do not derail easily as they would if universal flange proportions were used in all the scales. For instance, a Z scale wheel flange as defined in the NEM standard should be about 9% of the scale <b>nominal</b> standard <b>gauge</b> (...) , whereas the same standard gives only 5% for [...] standard gauge I scale.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{published}} O14 standards appeared in Model Railway Constructor magazine, September 1951. The article was titled [...] "A Narrow Gauge Layout" [...] and was by Douglas Clayton. He advocated HO standards, less 2.5mm coupled with coarse scale OO wheelsets set to 12.5 mm back to back. A subsequent article in 1953 provided {{details of his}} layout. Very little more happened regards the development of O14 until Roy Link published {{a new set of}} standards (1993 — revised 1994) in his magazine Narrow Gauge and Industrial Railway Modelling Review. They were developed for his range of O14 kits — now produced by David Janes under the name KBscale. They are based on the proven 4 mm scale EM standards (BRMSB) and are reasonably close to exact scale especially considering the variations to be found in prototype <b>nominal</b> 2′ <b>gauge</b> railways.|$|R
40|$|This {{final report}} {{supplement}} in presentation format describes a comprehensive multi-tasked contract study {{to continue the}} development of the silver bearing alloy now registered as aluminum alloy 2139 by the Aluminum Association. Two commercial scale ingots were processed into <b>nominal</b> plate <b>gauges</b> of two, four and six inches, and were extensively characterized in terms of metallurgical and crystallographic structure, and resulting mechanical properties. This report includes comparisons of the property combinations for this alloy and 2 XXX and 7 XXX alloys more widely used in high performance applications. Alloy 2139 shows dramatic improvement in all combinations of properties, moreover, the properties of this alloy are retained in all gauge thicknesses, contrary to typical reductions observed in thicker gauges of the other alloys in the comparison. The advancements achieved in this study are expected to result in rapid, widespread use of this alloy in a broad range of ground based, aircraft, and spacecraft applications...|$|R
5000|$|A {{gauge block}} is {{a block of}} metal or ceramic with two {{opposing}} faces ground precisely flat and parallel, a precise distance apart. Standard grade blocks are made of a hardened steel alloy, while calibration grade blocks are often made of tungsten carbide or chromium carbide because it is harder and wears less. [...] Gauge blocks come in sets of blocks of various lengths, along with two wear blocks, to allow {{a wide variety of}} standard lengths to be made up by stacking them. The length of each block is actually slightly shorter than the nominal length stamped on it, because the stamped length includes the length of one wring film, a film of lubricant which separates adjacent block faces in normal use. The thickness of the wring film is about [...] The <b>gauge's</b> <b>nominal</b> length is also known as the interferometric length.|$|R
40|$|Publisher's copy made {{available}} {{with the permission}} of the publisher © Australian Society of AnaesthetistsThe diameter of the left main bronchus is the determining dimension when selecting the size of a left tracheobronchial (double-lumen) tube for lung separation. However, this information is not given by any manufacturer, either on the tube or in the package insert. This paper describes the lengths and diameters of the deflated bronchial cuff segment of left tracheobronchial tubes in common use. One hundred and seventy-one left tracheobronchial tubes ranging in size from 28 to 41 <b>nominal</b> French <b>gauge</b> from four manufacturers were measured. There was wide variation between tubes of the same nominal size from the same manufacturer. For tubes of the same size from the same manufacturer, the diameter of the segment with the deflated bronchial cuff varied by more than 1 mm in diameter in some instances. The diameter of the bronchial cuff segment did not consistently decrease as the nominal size decreased even for the same manufacturer. There was major overlap in diameters of the bronchial segments between Fr 41, Fr 39, and Fr 37 tubes from most manufacturers, so that some of the Fr 39 tubes have a bronchial cuff segment diameter as much as 0. 5 mm larger than the Fr 41 tube. It is concluded that the current French gauge markings on left tracheobronchial tubes are of very limited value in determining the appropriate size to be selected for a patient. More accurate and consistent dimensions of tracheobronchial tubes are required to improve clinical selection. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{proposes a}} {{mathematical}} model for the gradual shape deterioration of wide-strip rolling mills working rolls active generatrixes subject to wear within the working zone during tandem rolling strips of a specified gauge. While modeling, the authors have determined the theoretical dependency needed to estimate the mean life of working rolls according to the transverse strip gauge interference criterion. Gauge interference of tandem-rolled strip transverse section shall be derived from {{the sum of the}} values of current shape of upper and lower working rolls active generatrixes, which are calculated based on strip width. In its turn, an active section of each roll shall be calculated for every following strip as a difference between the current roll radius values at the crown middle and that above/below the strip edge, while the shape deterioration rate of active roll generatrixes shall be defined by the difference between the roll wear rates in these sections. To estimate the rate of roll wear during rolling every following strip of the specified gauge, the base dependency of the structure-energy concept describing wear of stationary tribocouplings is used, which has been obtained by simultaneous solution of fundamental equations of molecule-mechanical and structure-energy friction theories. The moment of working roll failure (expected life) is determined based on the condition of achieving the <b>nominal</b> limit by <b>gauge</b> interference of a current strip...|$|R
40|$|Many {{previous}} studies cannot {{account for the}} high level of interest rates in the early 1980 s. For example, Clarida and Friedman (1983, 1984) demonstrate that relative to the predictions of either a structural or an astructural model, interest rates in the early 1980 s were too high. This article suggests that the customary empirical measures that gauge the short-run impact of monetary policy on interest rates have become increasingly noisy in the 1980 s and that this factor may have been partly responsible for deterioration in the predictive ability of these interest rate equations. In most {{previous studies}}, the short-run impact of monetary policy on rates has been captured by detrended measures of the real money supply defined either as real M 1 or real M 2. Such empirical measures of the money supply do not provide a consistent basis of comparison over time when deposit rate ceilings are removed and new liquid financial claims are introduced. These and other financial developments of the 1980 s also have altered the underlying relationships between the public’s demand for these assets and their traditional economic determinants, including the nominal rate (Hetzel and Mehra 1989; Feinman and Porter 1992). As a result, many of the published reduced forms for <b>nominal</b> rates that <b>gauge</b> the short-run impact of monetary policy by the The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond or the Federal Reserve System...|$|R
40|$|Evaluating {{summaries}} {{is currently}} {{performed by the}} use of statistically-based tools which lack any linguistic knowledge and are unable to produce grammatical and semantic judgements (Landauer et al., 1997). However, summary evaluation needs precise linguistic information with a much finer-grained coverage than what is being offered by currently available statistically based systems. We assume that the starting point of any interesting application in these fields must necessarily be a good syntactic-semantic parser. In this paper we present the system for text understanding called GETARUNS, General Text and Reference Understanding System (Delmonte, 2003). The heart of the system is a rule-based top-down parser, which uses an LFG oriented grammar organization. Lately, a less constrained version of the parser for the application field of text summarization has been developed, which allows the system to recover gracefully from failures. To this end, the parser is couple with another concurrent parsing processes: a partial or shallow parse is always produced and used to recover from complete failures. GETARUNS, has a highly sophisticated linguistically based semantic module which is used to build up the Discourse Model. Semantic processing is strongly modularized and distributed amongst a number of different submodules which take care of Spatio-Temporal Reasoning, Discourse Level Anaphora Resolution. Evaluation taps information from the Discourse Model and uses Predicate Argument Structures (PAS) to detect students’ understanding of the text to summarize. It also uses the output of the Anaphora Resolution Module to check for most relevant topics in the text which the student should have addressed in his/her summary. The system uses a Topics-Stack while processing the text in order to corefer referential expressions: The Topic-Stack Hierarchy <b>gauges</b> <b>nominal</b> heads as either Main, Secondary or Potential Topic. This grading is used as a score that allows the system to detect the most relevant entities in the text {{at the end of the}} computation...|$|R
