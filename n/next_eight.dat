But in April 1918, the Chicago Daily Tribune reported on an encounter El Occidente had with two German submarines {{that had occurred}} on 2 February.

The news item reported that El Occidentes gunners had demolished the periscope of one of her attackers.|$|E
5|$|The Chartists {{were active}} for the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> months but the poor {{attendance}} {{at a second}} meeting, held on the moor {{at the same time}} as a racing fixture on 25 May 1839, signalled the end of the movement. Although the movement was not successful initially, most of the Chartists' demands were eventually met by Parliament.|$|E

After the war ended, Rocco played one more season with the Indians in 1946, then returned to the minor leagues. There, he played primarily in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) until 1952, retiring after attempting to play amateur baseball in Minnesota and being ruled ineligible.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of leave, the {{battalion}} began to reform on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland during February 1944 and for the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> months they undertook a number of exercises and training periods as they prepared for {{the next stage of}} the war. During this time, the battalion's authorised strength was reduced to 803 men of all ranks, as the 3rd Division was converted to the Jungle divisional establishment. On 20 July 1944, the 61st Battalion embarked upon HMAT Katoomba in Cairns and proceeded overseas again. They arrived at Madang in New Guinea four days later. As it was considered that there were still isolated pockets of Japanese in the area, the battalion began patrolling operations almost as soon as they had landed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} Peace Prize {{was that}} awarded to Barack Obama in 2009. Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, {{but the actual}} evaluation occurred over the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> months. Obama himself stated {{that he did not}} feel deserving of the award, or worthy of the company it would place him in. Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E

Unable to escape, Linois fought until his ships were battered and he himself was badly wounded, but he eventually surrendered to the squadron under Admiral Warren that had followed London. Napoleon's fury at Linois was unabated and the French admiral remained a prisoner of war for the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> years.|$|E
5|$|During Richard's {{first years}} as king, {{government}} {{was in the}} hands of a series of councils. Most of the aristocracy preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, yet Gaunt remained highly influential. The first major challenge of the reign was the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The young king played a major part in the successful suppression of this crisis. In the following years, however, the king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Macedonian War (200–196 BC), Macedon {{had given}} Sparta control over Argos, an {{important}} {{city on the}} Aegean coast of Peloponnese. Sparta's continued occupation of Argos {{at the end of}} war was used as a pretext for Rome and its allies to declare war. The anti-Spartan coalition laid siege to Argos, captured the Spartan naval base at Gythium, and soon invested and besieged Sparta itself. Eventually, negotiations led to peace on Rome's terms, under which Argos and the coastal towns of Laconia were separated from Sparta and the Spartans were compelled to pay a war indemnity to Rome over the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> years. Argos joined the Achaean League, and the Laconian towns were placed under Achaean protection.|$|E

5|$|El Oriente {{was handed}} over to the USMC and {{assigned}} to United States Lines, Inc., for operation. The cargo ship was placed under Panamanian registry by U.S. Lines. Little is known of El Orientes movements over the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> months, but on 17 February El Oriente sailed from Houston, Texas, to Philadelphia and on to Reykjavík. From Reykjavík, she sailed to the Clyde, arriving there at the end of July. Over the next 5 months, El Oriente sailed around the British Isles, calling at Kirkwall, Belfast Lough, Barrow-in-Furness, and Liverpool, and back to Clyde in late December. From there, she sailed on one trip to Murmansk where she arrived on 27 January 1943.|$|E
5|$|Following the loss, Virginia Tech was 2–2 on the season, {{and faced}} the {{potential}} of being ineligible for a postseason bowl game {{if it did not}} improve its winning percentage. The Hokies won their <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> games, finishing the season with a 10–2 record. With late-season wins over perennial rival, 16th-ranked Virginia, and fellow ACC newcomer, ninth-ranked Miami, Virginia Tech clinched the ACC football championship (the last year in which it would be decided without a conference championship game) and a bid to a Bowl Championship Series game. Because the ACC's normal bowl destination, the Orange Bowl, was hosting the national championship game, Virginia Tech was selected to attend the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, instead.|$|E
5|$|HMS Collingwood was {{the lead}} ship of her class of ironclad battleships built for the Royal Navy during the 1880s. The ship's {{essential}} design became the standard {{for most of the}} following British battleships. Completed in 1887, she spent the next two years in reserve before she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet for the <b>next</b> <b>eight</b> years. After returning home in 1897, the ship spent the next six years as a guardship in Ireland. Collingwood was not significantly damaged during an accidental collision in 1899 and was paid off four years later. The ship was sold for scrap in 1909 and subsequently broken up.|$|E
