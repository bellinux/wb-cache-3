60|$|A gusty March morning had {{subsided}} into a sunshiny afternoon, <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> {{when a young}} man, slender, {{above the}} middle height, with a physiognomy thoughtful yet delicate, his brown hair worn long, slight whiskers, on his chin a tuft, knocked {{at the door of}} a house in Carrington Street, May Fair. His mien and his costume denoted a character of the class of artists. He wore a pair of green trousers, braided with a black stripe down their sides, puckered towards the waist, yet fitting with considerable precision to the boot of French leather that enclosed a well-formed foot. His waistcoat was of maroon velvet, displaying a steel watch-chain of refined manufacture, and a black satin cravat, with a coral brooch. His bright blue frockcoat was frogged and braided like his trousers. As the knocker fell from the primrose-coloured glove that screened his hand, he uncovered, and passing his fingers rapidly through his hair, resumed his new silk hat, which he placed rather on one side of his head.|$|E

6000|$|Here I must break off, after {{dealing with}} a page {{and a half of}} the Duke of Argyll's article. A state of health which has {{prevented}} me from publishing anything since [...] "The Factors of Organic Evolution," [...] now <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> prevents me from carrying the matter further. Could I have pursued the argument it would, I believe, have been practicable to show that various other positions taken up by the Duke of Argyll do not admit of effectual defence. But {{whether or not this is}} probable, the reader must be left to judge for himself. On one further point only will I say a word; and this chiefly because, if I pass it by, a mistaken impression of a serious kind may be diffused. The Duke of Argyll represents me as [...] "giving up" [...] the [...] "famous phrase" [...] "survival of the fittest," [...] and wishing [...] "to abandon it." [...] He does this because I have pointed out that its words have connotations against which we must be on our guard, if we would avoid certain distortions of thought. With equal propriety he might say that an astronomer abandons the statement that the planets move in elliptic orbits, because he warns his readers that in the heavens there exist no such things as orbits, but that the planets sweep on through a pathless void, in directions perpetually changed by gravitation.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} by some that <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> Penfield's topography {{was formed by}} melting glaciers. The same forces that created the Finger Lakes helped develop interesting terrain in and around Ellison Park.

[...] If the elegance of an eulogium consist in its extravagance, the 'Chronicle's' epithet is well chosen. But our purpose is not with the Dedication, nor the main Poem, 'The Corsair', but with one of the pieces called Poems, published {{at the end of the}} 'Corsair'. <b>Nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> (in March, 1812), when the REGENT was attacked with a bitterness and rancour that disgusted the whole country; when attempts were made day after day to wound every feeling of the heart; there appeared in the 'Morning Chronicle' an anonymous 'Address to a Young Lady weeping', upon which we remarked at the time ('Courier of March' 7, 1812), considering it as tending to make the Princess CHARLOTTE of WALES view the PRINCE REGENT her father as an object of suspicion and disgrace. Few of our readers have forgotten the disgust which this address excited. The author of it, however, unwilling that it should sleep in the oblivion to which it had been consigned with the other trash of that day, has republished it, and, placed the first of what are called Poems at the end of this newly published work the Corsair, we find this very address: ...|$|E
6000|$|My Dearest Clare,--Were I to {{make all}} the apologies {{necessary}} to atone [...] for my late negligence, you would justly say you had received a [...] petition instead of a letter, as it would be filled with prayers for [...] forgiveness; but instead of this, I will acknowledge my sins at [...] once, and I trust to your friendship and generosity rather than to my [...] own excuses. Though my health is not perfectly re-established, I am [...] out of all danger, and have recovered every thing but my spirits, [...] which are subject to depression. You will be astonished to hear I have [...] lately written to Delawarr, [2] for the purpose of explaining (as far [...] as possible without involving some old friends of mine in the [...] business) the cause of my behaviour to him during my last residence at [...] Harrow (<b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago),</b> which you will recollect was rather [...] "en cavalier." [...] Since that period, I have discovered he was treated [...] with injustice both by those who misrepresented his conduct, and by me [...] in consequence of their suggestions. I have therefore made all the [...] reparation in my power, by apologizing for my mistake, though with [...] very faint hopes of success; indeed I never expected any answer, but [...] desired one for form's sake; that has not yet arrived, and most [...] probably never will. However, I have eased my own conscience by [...] the atonement, which is humiliating enough to one of my disposition; [...] yet I could not have slept satisfied with the reflection of having, [...] even unintentionally, injured any individual. I have done all that [...] could be done to repair the injury, and there the affair must end. [...] Whether we renew our intimacy or not is of very trivial consequence.|$|E
60|$|And now I {{will tell}} you. It is <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> since I have known Mr. Browning. Mr. Kenyon wished {{to bring him}} to see me five years ago, as one of the lions of London who roared the gentlest and was best worth my knowing; but I refused then, in my blind dislike to seeing strangers. Immediately, however, after the {{publication}} of my last volumes, he wrote to me, and we had a correspondence which ended in my agreeing to receive him as I never had received any other man. I did not know why, but it was utterly impossible for me to refuse to receive him, though I consented against my will. He writes the most exquisite letters possible, and has a way of putting things which I have not, a way of putting aside--so he came. He came, and with our personal acquaintance began his attachment for me, a sort of infatuation call it, which resisted the various denials which were my plain duty at the beginning, and has persisted past them all. I began with--a grave assurance that I was in an exceptional position and saw him just in consequence of it, and that if ever he recurred to that subject again I never could see him again while I lived; and he believed me and was silent. To my mind, indeed, it was a bare impulse--a generous man of quick sympathies taking up a sudden interest with both hands! So I thought; but in the meantime the letters and the visits rained down more and more, and in every one there was something which was too slight to analyse and notice, but too decided not to be understood; so that at last, when the 'proposed respect' of the silence gave way, it was rather less dangerous. So then I showed him how he was throwing into the ashes his best affections--how the common gifts of youth and cheerfulness were behind me--how I had not strength, even of heart, for the ordinary duties of life--everything I told him and showed him. 'Look at this--and this,' throwing down all my disadvantages. To which he did not answer by a single compliment, but simply that he had not then to choose, and that I might be right or he might be right, he was not there to decide; but that he loved me and should to his last hour. He said that the freshness of youth had passed with him also, and that he had studied the world out of books and seen many women, yet had never loved one until he had seen me. That he knew himself, and knew that, if ever so repulsed, he should love me to his last hour--it should be first and last. At the same time, he would not tease me, he would wait twenty years if I pleased, and then, if life lasted so long for both of us, then when it was ending perhaps, I might understand him and feel that I might have trusted him. For my health, he had believed when he first spoke that I was suffering from an incurable injury of the spine, and that he never could hope to see me stand up before his face, and he appealed to my womanly sense of what a pure attachment should be--whether such a circumstance, if it had been true, was inconsistent with it. He preferred, he said, of free and deliberate choice, to be allowed to sit only an hour a day by my side, to the fulfilment of the brightest dream which should exclude me, in any possible world.|$|E
