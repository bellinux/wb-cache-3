This square was renamed Constitution Square (Πλατεία Συντάγματος) to commemorate (through to the present) the events of September 1843—and to feature many later tumultuous events of Greek history. Now for the first time, the king had Greeks in his Council and the French Party, the English Party and the Russian Party (according to which of the Great Powers' culture they most esteemed) vied for rank and power.|$|E
5|$|Outside the temple, Nadir waits {{beside the}} funeral pyre as the crowd, singing and dancing, anticipates the dawn {{and the coming}} double {{execution}} (""). He is joined by Leila; resigned now to their deaths, the pair sing of how their souls will soon be united in heaven. A glow appears in the sky, and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and Nadir. He returns the necklace to Leila, and reveals {{that he is the}} man she saved when she was a child. He recognises <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> love for her is in vain, and tells her and Nadir to flee.

5|$|Arab sources {{indicate}} that at about his time, the Sogdian princes called upon the Western Turks or the Turgesh for help against the Arabs, although the chronology and veracity of these accounts {{is open to}} question. At any rate, {{over the next two}} years Qutayba engaged in an effort to push the Caliphate's borders further and gain control of the Jaxartes valley. A large force, supported by some 20,000 Transoxianian levies, marched into the valley in early 713. The native levies were dispatched against Shash, which was reportedly taken, while Qutayba with the Arabs marched in the direction of Khujand and Ferghana. Little is known of these expeditions, although successful battles are recorded before Khujand and at Minak in Ushrusana, and the dispatch of an Arab embassy to the Chinese court is verified by Chinese sources. Al-Tabari reports that Qutayba marched into Chinese-held territory up to Kashgar, but this claim is dismissed by modern scholars. In 714, Qutayba renewed his expeditions along the Jaxartes, probably with Shash as his base, but his campaign was cut short upon receiving the news of the death of al-Hajjaj. Unsure of his position <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> patron was gone, he disbanded the army and returned to Merv.|$|E

25|$|After the {{publication}} of the committee's report on December 15, 1894, Crispi dissolved the Chamber by decree amidst increasing protests, which compelled Giolitti – <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> parliamentary immunity was lifted – to leave the country; officially to visit his daughter in Berlin. Crispi denounced the Giolitti documents as a mass of lies, but rumours of Crispi's resignation turned out to be unfounded. Five battalions of infantry had been brought to Rome to quell possible riots. Giolitti was accused of embezzlement as well as libel against Crispi and his wife, and was summoned before the courts in February 1895 after the Public Prosecutor, sustained by lower courts, had started the prosecution. However, on April 24, 1895, the Supreme Court decided that Giolitti could not be tried by an ordinary civil court, as Giolitti had argued, because he had made his accusations against Crispi in the Chamber. Only the Senate could hear the case.|$|E

500|$|The {{style that}} emerged from Tippett's long {{compositional}} apprenticeship {{was the product of}} many diverse influences. Beethoven and Handel were initial models (Handel above Bach, who in Tippett's view lacked drama), supplemented by 16th- and 17th-century masters of counterpoint and madrigal—Thomas Weelkes, Monteverdi and Dowland. Purcell became significant later, and Tippett came to lament his ignorance of Purcell during his RCM years: [...] "It seems to me incomprehensible <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> work was not even recommended in composition lessons as a basic study for the setting of English".|$|E

500|$|Simon Leng observes an uncharacteristic spontaneity in Harrison's {{work ethic}} on Dark Horse, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> home and {{recording}} base were {{one and the}} same. The discipline of working to a schedule [...] "flew out the ornate windows", Leng writes, along with his usual painstaking approach to recording. After catching Joni Mitchell's concert at the New Victoria Theatre in London, in April 1974, Harrison was much impressed with her jazz-rock backing band, the L.A. Express, led by saxophonist and flautist Tom Scott, and invited them to Friar Park the following day. The ensemble – Harrison, Scott, Robben Ford (guitar), Roger Kellaway (keyboards), Max Bennett (bass) and John Guerin (drums) – recorded an instrumental track that later became the opening number on the Harrison–Shankar tour, [...] "Hari's on Tour (Express)". [...] "Simply Shady", which Harrison had written while in Bombay, was taped later the same day. Having formed a rapport with Harrison after they had worked together on Shankar Family & Friends the year before, Scott stayed on at Friar Park and overdubbed various horn parts onto [...] "Ding Dong" [...] and the two new tracks. Scott later told journalist Michael Gross {{that he was the}} first Western musician that Harrison approached to join him on the upcoming tour.|$|E

They try {{to persuade him to}} join them but he refuses, convinced <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> family are dead. Quatermass, aided by Gurov, who has travelled to London from Moscow, assembles a team of scientists to find a solution. He deliberately selects old people for the task as they are immune to the effects of the alien force. Quatermass decides to set a trap. He plans to fake the presence of a large gathering of Planet People at Kapp's observatory and, when the force comes, to detonate a nuclear weapon. Quatermass does not believe this will be sufficient to destroy the alien machine but he hopes that it will damage it enough to make it go away. Kapp volunteers to stay behind with Quatermass to help detonate the bomb. The pair set up the trap and wait. Suddenly, Kickalong appears with a group of Planet People, including Quatermass' granddaughter, Hettie. Kapp tries to warn them away but is shot by Kickalong. The light appears, indicating that the alien force has arrived, but the shock of seeing his granddaughter among the Planet People causes Quatermass to suffer a heart attack. However, aided by Hettie, he is able to detonate the bomb. Later, according to Gurov, [...] "The message was taken. It has not come again. We pray it will never come again".|$|E
500|$|On Nova Chrysalia's final day, Hope reveals to Lightning that Bhunivelze {{used him}} to watch over Lightning and that the deity will dispose of him <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> task is completed. After Hope disappears, Lightning is transported to Luxerion and enters the cathedral, where Noel, Snow and Fang help her fight the Order to save Vanille. Lightning manages to {{convince}} her to free {{the souls of the}} dead. This act allows Lightning to find Serah's soul, kept hidden inside Lumina to keep it safe, but Bhunivelze arrives using Hope as his host and captures everyone but Lightning. Transported to an otherworldly realm, Lightning meets Bhunivelze in person, and learns his true agenda: that he has been planning to make Lightning take Etro's place as the Goddess of Death. Because Lightning prevented the ritual, he plans to destroy the new world and create another one, with those living on it to be created in his image, under his full control. The two battle, and after wounding the god in battle, Lightning frees Hope from Bhunivelze's influence and prepares to become the new goddess in order protect the new world by trapping herself and Bhunivelze in the Unseen Realm. An illusion of Serah then confronts Lightning, revealing Lumina as the physical manifestation of Lightning's suppressed vulnerabilities. Accepting Lumina as a part of herself, Lightning calls for aid. Hope, Snow, Noel, Vanille, Fang and the Eidolons answer her call, and they sever Bhunivelze's hold on the souls of humanity, including Sazh, Dajh, Mog, and a revived Serah. The souls then unite and defeat Bhunivelze, ending his reign once and for all. In the aftermath, Caius and the multiple versions of Yeul choose to remain in the Unseen Realm and protect the balance between worlds in Etro's stead. The final incarnation of Yeul, who alone wishes for a new life, is allowed to accompany Lightning and her friends. After the Eidolons and Mog depart for the Unseen Realm, Lightning, her allies, and the souls of humanity travel to a new world, which turns out to be Earth. A final monologue by Lightning states that the crystal age is now a legend, and [...] "it ended before you were born".|$|E
