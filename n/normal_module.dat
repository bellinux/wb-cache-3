The transformed EFSM allows to apply methods based on the finite state machine (FSM) model for test case generation.

40|$|Accurate {{simulation}} of soil water and heat transfer {{is critical to}} understand surface hydrology under cold conditions. Using an extended freezing code in HYDRUS- 1 D (freezing module), this study was conducted: (1) to evaluate the freezing module using field data collected in a grazed steppe of Inner Mongolia; and (2) to further simulate grazing effects on frozen soil hydrological processes. The experimental data consisted of soil water and temperature profiles measured during freeze-thaw cycles from 2005 to 2006 in two plots (ungrazed since 1979 (UG 79) and winter grazing (WG)). To check {{the sensitivity of the}} freezing module, a model without a freezing scheme (<b>normal</b> <b>module)</b> was used for comparison. We found that while the <b>normal</b> <b>module</b> can only simulate soil water and heat transfer under unfrozen conditions, the freezing module can simulate well under both frozen and unfrozen conditions. The freezing module can reasonably compute water phase change and, therefore, substantially improved the {{simulation of}} the evolution of liquid water and temperature in frozen soil. It overestimated liquid water content during spring snowmelt and, thus, underestimated surface runoff from underlying frozen soil layers. Furthermore, the weak prediction of soil moisture at the WG site, compared with the UG 79 site, might relate to the less than ideal parameterization of soil hydraulic properties. Our results confirmed that the freezing module was able to accurately predict behaviors of soil freezing and thawing, as well as the effects of land management. We suggest that detailed knowledge of the soil-atmosphere processes is needed to improve the surface runoff algorithm in the frozen soil module...|$|E

40|$|In modular {{reconfigurable}} systems, individual modules {{are capable}} of limited motion due to blocking and connectivity constraints, yet the entire system has {{a large number of}} degrees of freedom. The combination of these two facts makes motion planning for such systems exceptionally challenging. In this paper we present two results that shed some light on this problem. First we show that, for a robotic system consisting of hexagonal 2 D modules, the absence of a single excluded configuration is sufficient to guarantee the feasibility of the motion planning problem (for any two connected configurations with the same number of modules). We also provide an analysis of the number of steps in which the reconfiguration can be accomplished. Second, we argue that skeletal metamodules, which are scaffoldinglike structures in 2 D built out of <b>normal</b> <b>modules,</b> offer an interesting alternative. General shapes can be built out of these metamodules and, unlike the case for shapes built directly out of modules, a metamodule can collapse and pass through the interior of its neighboring metamodules, thus eliminating all blocking constraints. This tunneling capability makes the motion planning problem easier and allows faster reconfiguration as well, by providing a higher bandwidth conduit, the interior of the shape, through which the modules can flow. The conclusion of our work is that it is worthwhile to study subclasses of shapes that (1) approximate closely arbitrary shapes, while also (2) simplifying significantly the motion planning problem...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePhotovoltaic (PV) panels, {{depending}} on the PV cell technology used, convert {{only a small amount}} of incident energy into electricity (about 5 – 25 % for commercial systems), and the rest is converted into heat. The produced heat is partly transferred back to the environment while the remaining part causes the enhancement of the PV panel temperature itself. This increase in the PV panel temperature further affects power production adversely, if the PV panel temperature rises above the standard operating temperature (usually 25 °C). The present study deals with the thermal analysis of PV panel involving (i) numerical study based on finite element heat transfer, (ii) the outdoor experimental validation of the thermal model developed. The thermal model is based on the energy balance of the PV module in which all essential heat transfer mechanisms between the module to the environment and related power output are modeled to observe the net change in PV module temperature. The results clearly demonstrate the need and ability of the model to realistically simulate the thermal behavior of PV panels. Additionally, using the same model, numerical simulations have been also carried out for two different cities, namely Allahabad and Jodhpur, for Indian climate, to predict the hourly average module temperature of PV panels for different months.

40|$|We discuss comorbidity, continuity, and {{discontinuity}} of anxiety-related disorders {{from the}} perspective of a two-dimensional neuropsychology of fear (threat avoidance) and anxiety (threat approach). Pharmacological dissection of the "neurotic" disorders justifies both a categorical division between fear and anxiety and a subdivision of each mapped to a hierarchy of neural modules that process different immediacies of threat. It is critical that each module can generate normal responses, symptoms of another syndrome, or syndromal responses. We discuss the resultant possibilities for comorbid dysfunction of these modules both with each other and with some disorders not usually classified as anxiety related. The simplest case is symptomatic fear/anxiety comorbidity, where dysfunction in one module results in excess activity in a second, otherwise <b>normal,</b> <b>module</b> to generate symptoms and apparent comorbidity. More complex is syndromal fear/anxiety comorbidity, where more than one module is concurrently dysfunctional. Yet more complex are syndromal comorbidities of anxiety that go beyond the two dimensional fear/anxiety systems: depression, substance use disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Our account of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-anxiety comorbidity entails discussion of the neuropsychology of externalizing disorders to account for the lack of anxiety comorbidity in some of these. Finally, we link the neuropsychology of disorder to personality variation, and to the development of a biomarker of variation in the anxiety system among individuals that, if extreme, may provide a means of unambiguously identifying the first of a range of anxiety syndromes...|$|E

40|$|Industrial gears {{are often}} very expensive; they {{are large and}} {{manufactured}} in batches of small quantities, or even individually. Nevertheless, several industrial gears are prematurely discarded because of superficial damages, even if modern technologies and machine tools can completely repair these kinds of failures. For a long time, in fact, the repair of a gear {{was limited to the}} modification of the addendum modification coefficient (a. k. a. profile shift coefficient), while the modification of the pressure angle was usually impracticable, due to the axis limitations of the conventional gear machinery, where the pressure angle and the <b>normal</b> <b>module</b> are set by the tooling. Thus for each repair requiring that pressure angle variation, a gear tooling with the modified pressure angle should be used. In the past decade, the scenario has changed, thanks to the introduction of the - multi-axis CNC Machine Centers, - gear modules for CAD/CAM software, - evolution of CNC Gear Grinding machines, - development of new cutting tools able to machine parts with surface hardness higher than 60 HRC. The above has enabled the application of new types of modification for the refurbishment of superficially damaged gears. This paper presents a new approach to repair industrial gears by showing a case study where pressure angle modification is also considered, differently from the past repairing procedures that dealt only with the modification of the profile shift coefficient. A computer program has been developed to automatically determine the repair alternatives under two goals: minimize the stock removal or maximize gear tooth strength. It will also be shown that the refurbishment of industrial gears using these approaches can result in a 30 - 40 % savings, compared to the cost of a new part, without reducing gear strength. This paper will also show that the whole repair procedure can be carried out in no more than two weeks, depending on the gear size...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of transient elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) analyses of the meshing cycle of helical gears. Previous workers have analysed helical gears using a range of techniques, including thin slice models and models which take into account the effects of three-dimensional surface roughness. Previous work by the Cardiff group has investigated the effects of tooth micro-geometry (tip relief) on contact pressures and lubrication performance. The current work investigates the effect of tooth profile errors (deviations from the involute form) on elastohydrodynamic performance. The profile errors were measured on helical test gears using a Klingelnberg P 65 gear measuring machine. The gears are of 6 mm <b>normal</b> <b>module,</b> 20 º reference pressure angle, 26. 3 º base helix angle, and 44 mm face width, with the wheel having 24 teeth and the pinion 23 teeth. The gears were analysed over the meshing cycle, and the transmitted load was chosen such that the maximum Hertzian contact pressure would be 1. 6 GPa in the example shown here. The tooth load corresponding to the contact pressure of 1. 6 GPa is 60 kN with Hertzian semi dimensions a = 0. 5 mm and b = 36 mm. Profile error and tip relief geometry was included in the surface geometry based on the digital profile information obtained from the Klingelnberg measurements. It should be emphasised that the profile deviations are at much lower spatial frequencies than surface roughness effects – indeed profile errors would usually be removed by the standard filtering process applied to measurements of gear surface finish. Figure 1 shows a comparison of film thickness contours for the smooth (upper) case (with tip relief) and the case including profile errors in addition to tip relief (lower). The presence of the profile error features can be seen to {{have a significant effect on}} the lubricant film thickness, with the loadbearing area developing a series of grooves. Between the grooves, the loadbearing surface develops ridges which give rise to elevated contact pressures significantly above those found in the smooth result. These are plotted in Figure 2 which is a section. through the contact at x = 0, which is the meshing contact line. The effects of profile errors on lubrication performance of helical gears can be clearly seen in these results, and the paper goes on to discuss the implications of these rarely considered effects for surface longevity...|$|E
