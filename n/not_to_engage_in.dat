5|$|In the episode, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) and Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) are {{undergoing}} couples therapy with the hospital's psychiatrist, Dr. Wyatt (Amy Madigan). The two are instructed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> sexual activity, until their emotional deficits are healed, which they find uneasy to accomplish. Clara Ferguson (Zoe Boyle) {{is no longer}} depressed, and urges Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), who has given her attentive care, to return home.|$|E
5|$|Vahan was {{instructed}} by Heraclius <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> battle until all avenues of diplomacy had been explored. This was probably because Yazdegerd III's forces {{were not yet}} ready for the offensive in Iraq. Accordingly, Vahan sent Gregory and then Jabalah to negotiate, though their efforts proved futile. Before the battle, on Vahan's invitation, Khalid came to negotiate peace, to a similar end. These negotiations delayed the battles for a month.|$|E

5|$|Braham was not {{satisfied}} with his current score-rate and lack of action in September 1943. Consequently, he flew a number of missions against ground targets. Successful night fighter pilots were ordered <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> such activities that exposed them to excessive risk. On one particular mission he decided to hunt enemy rail transport after failing to find enemy aircraft. On the Dieppe to Paris line he intercepted a locomotive which exploded after being hit. He attacked another but struck some trees which damaged {{the underside of the}} fuselage. Braham maintained control and flew home. It was not unusual for him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects. After one sortie against shipping the armourers were drenched in salt water and seaweed when they opened the panel housing the cannons with the intention of replacing spent ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} role in the Clan is that of the leader. The Clan leader overlooks all duties of Clan life, and will make all the important decisions, such as whether or <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> battle. Each Clan leader is given nine lives by StarClan, in order to sacrifice their lives nine times over to protect their Clan, and to serve their clans for many more moons to come. This means that Clan leaders can often live longer than that of a normal cat. To mark their new status, Clan leaders are given the suffix –star (e.g. Bluestar, Tallstar, and Brokenstar). Generally, Clan leaders sleep alone, although male leaders are allowed to take a mate. Female leaders are inhibited from taking a mate or having kits, which has led to discussions of sexism among many fans of the series.|$|E
5|$|Khalid's {{strategy}} of {{withdrawing from the}} occupied areas and concentrating all of his troops for a decisive battle forced the Byzantines to concentrate their five armies in response. The Byzantines had for centuries avoided engaging in large-scale decisive battles, and the concentration of their forces created logistical strains for which the empire was ill-prepared. Damascus was the closest logistical base, but Mansur, leader of Damascus, could not fully supply the massive Byzantine army that was gathered at the Yarmouk plain. Several clashes were reported with local citizens over supply requisition, as summer was at an end {{and there was a}} decline of pasturage. Greek court sources accused Vahan of treason for his disobedience to Heraclius' command <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> large-scale battle with Arabs. Given the massing of the Muslim armies at Yarmouk, however, Vahan {{had little choice but to}} respond in kind. Relations between the various Byzantine commanders were also fraught with tension. There was a struggle for power between Trithurios and Vahan, Jarajis, and Qanatir (Buccinator). Jabalah, the Christian Arab leader, was largely ignored, to the detriment of the Byzantines given his knowledge of the local terrain. An atmosphere of mistrust thus existed between the Romans, Greeks, Armenians, and Arabs. Longstanding ecclesiastical feuds between the Monophysite and Chalcedonian factions, while of negligible direct impact, certainly inflamed underlying tensions. The effect of these feuds was decreased coordination and planning, one of the reasons for the catastrophic Byzantine defeat.|$|E

25|$|While the Samogitians were plundering Courland, {{the knights}} from Kuldīga {{requested}} reinforcements from Klaipėda. The Knights pursued retreating Samogitians, who carried their loot {{back home and}} the decisive battle took place near Skuodas. The Livonian Rhymed Chronicle blamed the defeat on the cowardly Curonians, who did not withstand the Samogitian pressure and retreated from the battlefield leaving the knights exposed. Inspired by the success, the Samogitians almost immediately organized another raid into Courland. This time Livonian Grand Master Burchard von Hornhausen commanded the Knights. However, the Knights were careful to avoid an ambush while the Samogitians decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> a pitched battle.|$|E

Although these banknotes are not legal tender in the UK, {{this does not mean}} that they are illegal under English law, and creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose. Traders may, on the other hand, choose not to accept banknotes as payment, as contract law across the United Kingdom allows parties <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> a transaction at the point of payment if they choose not to.|$|E
25|$|Before the Partition of India in 1947, Kargil {{was part}} of the Baltistan {{district}} of Ladakh, a sparsely populated region with diverse linguistic, ethnic and religious groups, living in isolated valleys separated by some of the world's highest mountains. The First Kashmir War (1947–48) concluded with the LOC bisecting the Baltistan district, with the town and district of Kargil lying on the Indian side in the Ladakh subdivision of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.

All local political parties oppose any transfer of sovereignty to Spain, instead supporting self-determination.

25|$|While Heraclius {{launched}} his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd {{was unable to}} muster his armies in time to provide the Byzantines with Persian support. Umar, allegedly aware of this alliance, capitalized on this failure: not wanting to risk a battle with two great powers simultaneously, he quickly moved to reinforce the Muslim army at Yarmouk to engage and defeat the Byzantines. Meanwhile, Umar ordered Saad to enter into peace negotiations with Yazdegerd III and invite him to Islam to prevent Persian forces from taking the field. Heraclius instructed his general Vahan <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> battle with the Muslims before receiving explicit orders; however, fearing more Arab reinforcements, Vahan attacked the Muslim army in the Battle of Yarmouk in August 636. Heraclius's Imperial army was routed.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} actions of his Corps {{took place during}} the Battle of Sedan. By this time, Richthofen had moved into St. Trond-Liege in Belgium. The heavy German air assaults on French {{positions}} included 360 by his medium bombers, although his Ju 87 units could only fly 90 owing to the difficulties he had moving his Corps around. On 14 May Richthofen's JG 27 helped defend the bridgehead from Allied air attacks. Allied bomber strength was decimated. During the battle Richthofen suffered a personal blow: Günter Schwartzkopff, Geschwaderkommodore of StG 77, was killed. Schwartzkopff was one of the founding members of the German dive-bomber arm and had specialised knowledge on the method of attack. He had been ordered <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> combat.|$|E
