40|$|AbstractA {{reduction}} of <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste</b> by <b>transmutation</b> of trans-uranium elements (TRUs), such as Pu and Minor Actinides (MAs) contained in Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF), {{is a goal}} for future reactors. In general, countries with on-going nuclear scenarios would profit from MA mass stabilization, while transmutation of Pu and MAs from SNF could be desired in countries in nuclear phase-out. Both missions {{can be accomplished by}} employing fast reactors loaded with fuels containing different amounts of Pu and MAs in a closed (or partially closed) fuel cycle. In this paper, two 1200 MWth sodium-cooled fast reactor cores, based on the French ASTRID design, are proposed for burning TRUs (phase-out option) or only MAs (on-going option). Main attention is focused on the safety and on the transmutation performance. The coolant void effect, in the region including the core and the plenum above and the Doppler constant of both systems are negative also with irradiated fuel. The conversion ratios (CR) of the Pu and MA burners are in the ranges from 0. 6 to 0. 7 and from 0. 5 to 0. 6, respectively. These results show a large safety and transmutation potential of ASTRID type reactors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{study of}} fission yields {{has a major}} impact on the {{characterization}} and understanding of the fission process and is mandatory for reactor applications. While the yields are known for the major actinides (235 U, 239 Pu) in the thermal neutron-induced fission, only few measurements have been performed on 242 Am. The interest of 242 Am concerns the reduction of radiotoxicity of 241 Am in <b>nuclear</b> <b>wastes</b> using <b>transmutation</b> reactions. This paper presents the measurement of the fission mass yields from the reaction 241 Am(2 nth,f) performed at the Lohengrin mass spectrometer (ILL, France) for both the light and the heavy peaks: a total of 41 mass yields have been measured. The experiment was also meant to determine whether there is a difference in mass yields between the isomeric state and the ground state as it exists in fission and capture cross sections. The method used to address this question is based on a repeated measurement of a set of fission mass yields {{as a function of the}} ratio between the 242 gAm and the 242 mAm fission rates. The presented experiment is also a first step towards the measurement of the isotopic fission yields of 242 Am. ...|$|R

While the use of MHD pumps for heavy liquid metals has not been fully investigated, they are beginning to be used and studied in R and D facilities in support of the development of advanced <b>nuclear</b> reactors and <b>waste</b> <b>transmutation</b> systems. One MHD pump was tested in its full operation range in the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV).

Under the rated head of 0. 99 meter in TC- 1, the pump capacity is 15 m 3 /hr.

The research is directed towards developing the GFR as an economic electricity generator, with good safety and sustainability characteristics. Fast reactors maximise the usefulness of uranium resources by breeding plutonium and can contribute to minimising both the quantity and radiotoxicity <b>nuclear</b> <b>waste</b> by actinide <b>transmutation</b> in a closed fuel cycle.

40|$|Brian Josephson appealed at {{the meeting}} of the Nobel Laureates July 2004 against the ignorance of {{physicist}} to the phenomenon of cold fusion. Though there are good reasons against many publications on this topic but not for all what was reported. It seems to be indicated to summarize the following serious, reproducible and confirmed observations on the reactions of protons or deuterons incorporated in host metals such as palladium, nickel and other metals. We underline the confusing discovery by Cockroft and Oliphant with the anomalous low energy for nuclear reactions which was hundred times lower than in the usual cases when smashing nuclei against their Coulomb potential. A similar unexpected result was that of Otto Hahn&# 8217;s-the chemist!-Discovery of fission that had changed the world. A significant result of cold fusion was seen in gaseous atmosphere or discharges between palladium targets, rather significant and fully reproducible, e. g. From the &# 8220;life after death&# 8221; heat production of such high values per host atom that only nuclear reactions can be involved. This supports the earlier evaluation of neutron generation in fully reversible experiments with gas discharges hinting that a reasonable screening effect-preferably in the swimming electron layer-may lead to reactions at nuclear distances d of picometers with reaction probability times U off about mega seconds similar to the K-shell capture radioactivity. Further electrolytic experiments led to Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) where the involvement of pollution could be excluded from the generation of very seldom rare earth elements. A basically new theory for DD cross sections is used to confirm the picometer-mega second reactions of cold fusion. Other theoretical aspects are given from measured heavy element distributions similar to the standard abundance distribution, SAD, in the Universe with consequences on endothermic heavy nucleus generation, magic numbers and to quark-gluon plasmas.

We have measured the neutron capture cross section of 234 U at the recently constructed neutron time-of-flight facility n TOF at CERN [2] in the energy range from 0. 03 eV to 1 MeV with high accuracy due to a combination of features unique in the world: A high instantaneous neutron fluence and excellent energy resolution of the n TOF facility, an innovative Data Acquisition System based on flash ADCs [3] and the use of a high performance 4 _BaF 2 Total Absorption Calorimeter (TAC) as a detection device [4, 5]. In this paper, we will describe the experimental apparatus including the various TAC components and its performance. We also will present results from the 234 U(n,) measurement.
