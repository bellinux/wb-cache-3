5|$|Aposematism (from Greek ἀπό apo away, σῆμα sema sign) was a <b>new</b> <b>term</b> {{coined by}} Edward Bagnall Poulton for Alfred Russel Wallace's concept of warning coloration.

Aposematism always involves an advertising signal. The warning signal may take the form of conspicuous animal coloration, sounds, odours or other perceivable characteristics. Aposematic signals are beneficial for both the predator and prey, since both avoid potential harm.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} {{general theory of}} {{relativity}} to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a <b>new</b> <b>term,</b> the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E

Our initial comparison of terms used in the first three levels of the GAAP hierarchy to those terms used in the Codification finds that although the authors were generally internally consistent in the Codification, there are instances where terminology differs from the terminology used in the original pronouncements.

5|$|On the {{political}} level, Duhalde's presidency was {{strongly influenced by}} his feud with Menem. Menem wanted to run for a <b>new</b> <b>term</b> as president in the 2003 election, and Duhalde wanted to prevent it. To this purpose, he sought other candidates that may have defeated him. Some of these potential candidates were Carlos Reutemann, José Manuel de la Sota, Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá and Roberto Lavagna, but none of those negotiations bore fruit. The scandal {{over the death of}} the piqueteros Maximiliano Kosteki and Manuel Santillán in the Avellaneda massacre forced Duhalde to rush the elections by six months. As a result, he chose Néstor Kirchner, governor of Santa Cruz Province, despite his reservations. Kirchner was fifth in the presidential polls, and was mostly unknown by the public. Duhalde speculated that, although Menem had a large number of willing voters to begin with, he was also very unpopular. Thus, Menem might have won the elections but if the results called for a ballotage, most of the population would rally under any candidate with a chance to defeat him.|$|E

5|$|Carlos Menem {{ran for a}} <b>new</b> <b>term</b> as {{president}} in 2003, and Eduardo Duhalde tried to prevent it. Instead of holding primary elections within the PJ, the 2003 elections used {{a variant of the}} Ley de Lemas. All the Peronist candidates were allowed to run in the general election, using their own tickets. Although Kirchner ran for president with Duhalde's support, he was not the president's first choice. Trying to prevent a third term for Menem, Duhalde approached Santa Fe governor Carlos Reutemann and Córdoba governor José Manuel de la Sota; Reutemann declined, and De la Sota did not run because he was insufficiently popular. Duhalde also unsuccessfully approached Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá, and Roberto Lavagna, all of whom refused to run. Duhalde initially resisted supporting Kirchner, fearing that Kirchner would ignore him if elected. Kirchner run on the Front for Victory ticket, one of the several fronts put up by the PJ. Since Kirchner was identified with the centre-left, Duhalde appointed the centre-right Daniel Scioli as his vice-presidential candidate. Only a handful of Peronist governors supported either candidate; most remained neutral, awaiting the election to forge a relationship with the victor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Alexander the Great, the only Macedonian cavalry units attested in battle were the {{companion}} cavalry. However, during his campaign in Asia against the Persian Empire he formed a hipparchia (i.e. unit {{of a few hundred}} horsemen) of companion cavalry composed entirely of ethnic Persians. When marching his forces into Asia, Alexander brought 1,800 cavalrymen from Macedonia, 1,800 cavalrymen from Thessaly, 600 cavalrymen from the rest of Greece, and 900 prodromoi cavalry from Thrace. Antipater was able to quickly levy 600 native Macedonian cavalry to fight in the Lamian War when it began in 323 BC. For his infantry, the most elite members of his hypaspistai were designated as the agema, yet a <b>new</b> <b>term</b> for hypaspistai emerged after the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC: the argyraspides ('silver shields'). The latter continued to serve after {{the reign of}} Alexander the Great and may have been of Asian origin. Overall, his pike-wielding infantry numbered some 12,000 men, 3,000 of which were elite hypaspistai and 9,000 of which were pezhetairoi. Alexander continued the use of Cretan archers, yet around this time a clear reference to the use of native Macedonian archers was made. After the Battle of Gaugamela, archers of West Asian backgrounds became commonplace and were organized into chiliarchs.|$|E
5|$|Once {{passed by}} the Senate, a bill {{is sent to the}} House of Delegates for consideration. If the House also approves the bill without amendment, it is sent to the Governor. If there is amendment, however, the Senate may either reconsider the bill with {{amendments}} or ask {{for the establishment of a}} conference committee to work out differences in the versions of the bill passed by each chamber. Once a piece of legislation approved by both houses is forwarded to the Governor, it may either be signed or vetoed. If it is signed, it takes effect on the effective date of the legislation, usually October 1 of that year. If it is vetoed, both the Senate and the House of Delegates must vote by a three-fifths majority to overturn the veto. They may not, however, overturn a veto in the first year of a <b>new</b> <b>term,</b> since the bill would have been passed during the previous session. Additionally, joint resolutions and the budget bill may not be vetoed, although the General Assembly is constitutionally limited in the extent to which it may influence the latter; it may only decrease the Governor's budget proposal, not increase it.|$|E

With regard to the fact that <b>new</b> <b>terms</b> always appear, that {{magazine}} as a written communication is read by many people from different levels of ages, that GFresh magazine contains many <b>new</b> <b>terms</b> and also that those <b>new</b> <b>terms</b> are formed through word-formation process, the writer then wants to conduct a research on Word Formation processes in the GFresh magazine articles. In this research, the writer uses Yule?s theory and Chaer?s theory as supporting theories. This study was conducted by using descriptive qualitative approach. In this study, the data were taken from GFresh magazine articles in March edition 2008. To know whether the terms are considered into <b>new</b> <b>terms,</b> the writer used Thesaurus Indonesian language 2006. From the finding, the writer found 77 <b>new</b> <b>terms</b> in GFresh magazine articles in March edition 2008. Findings show that, only 6 processes of word formation applied on those <b>new</b> <b>terms.</b> They are Borrowing, Blending, Clipping, Acronym, Derivation, and Reduplication. The writer also found that one term may include more than one word formation processes. These processes are called multiple processes. With regard to the frequency and predominant process of the <b>new</b> <b>terms,</b> the writer concludes that Borrowing is the most frequently used in GFresh magazine articles (34. 65 %). The second process is Clipping (29, 70 %). The third is Acronym (12, 87 %), and the fourth is Blending and Reduplication both of them (5. 94 %). Other word formation percentages are Derivation (4, 95 %), Coinage, Conversion, Back-formation, Compounding was not used at all. Besides, there are some terms that do not belong to any of the word formation. They are categorized as Miscellaneous (11, 88 %). Those miscellaneous processes covered some words that have been formed using number, such as satu 2 nya, T 2 and kebut 2 an. These words were formed using number 2 which represents repetition. To follow, some words have also been formed through miscellaneous letter such as U for you and Q for aq/aku (I) ...|$|R
