25|$|Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as {{pesticides}} and fertilizers, and technological developments have {{in many cases}} sharply increased yields from cultivation, {{but at the same}} time have caused widespread ecological damage and <b>negative</b> <b>human</b> health effects. Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare, enviromental damage (such as massive drainage of resources such as water and feed fed to the animals, global warming, rainforest destruction, leftover waste products that are littered), and the health effects of the antibiotics, growth hormones, artificial additives and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production. Genetically modified organisms are an increasing component of agriculture, although they are banned in several countries. Agricultural food production and water management are increasingly becoming global issues that are fostering debate on a number of fronts. Significant degradation of land and water resources, including the depletion of aquifers, has been observed in recent decades, and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of agriculture on global warming are still not fully understood. However, entomophagy would solve most of the former problems, and may start to gain popularity among society in the West.|$|E
2500|$|They came to Middle-earth {{around the}} year 1000 of the Third Age, when the forest of 'Greenwood the Great' fell under shadow and became known as Mirkwood. [...] The wizards already {{appeared}} old when they entered Middle-earth. They were [...] "clothed" [...] in the bodies of old Men, as the Valar wished them to guide the inhabitants of Middle-earth by persuasion and encouragement, not by force or fear. They were forbidden to dominate the free peoples of Middle-earth or to match Sauron's power with power. However, they aged very slowly and were in fact immortal. Physically they were [...] "real" [...] Men, and felt all the urges, pleasures and fears of flesh and blood. Therefore, {{in spite of their}} specific and unambiguous goal, the Wizards were capable of human feelings; Gandalf, for example, felt great affection for the Hobbits. They could also feel <b>negative</b> <b>human</b> emotions such as greed, jealousy, and lust for power. It is hinted in the essay in Unfinished Tales that the Blue Wizards may have fallen prey to these temptations, though information published in The Peoples of Middle-earth seems to contradict this version of their history.|$|E

Finally, more research in these areas is needed.|$|E
