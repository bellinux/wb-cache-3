50|$|<b>North</b> <b>Cape</b> {{was once}} an island formed by a marine volcano.

40|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Cape</b> Mafic-Ultramafic Complex is an 8 km 2 igneous massif at {{the northeastern}} {{tip of the}} North Island of New Zealand {{consisting}} of mafic and ultramafic phaneritic intrusions, {{some of which are}} cumulates. It was originally thought to represent the lowest levels of a Late Cretaceous-Paleocene ophiolite sequence known as the Northland Allochthon. The Tangihua Complex, the volcanic components of the Northland Allochthon has a geochemical signature indicating that it formed in a supra-subduction zone. These lavas have been hydrothermally altered to up to greenschist facies from obduction in the Oligocene. The mafic and ultramafic intrusions at <b>North</b> <b>Cape</b> display only minor, low-grade clay alteration, inconsistent {{with the rest of the}} Northland Allochthon. Whole rock geochemistry from this study shows that the intrusions at <b>North</b> <b>Cape</b> have an island-arc signature in clear contrast with the supra-subduction zone signature of the Tangihua Complex. This suggests that the intrusions at <b>North</b> <b>Cape</b> are more related to the Miocene-aged Northland Volcanic Arc. Geochemical modeling confirms this relationship; the Northland Volcanic Arc series can be produced from between three and forty-six percent fraction of the <b>North</b> <b>Cape</b> magma. The <b>North</b> <b>Cape</b> intrusions contain very high amounts of the mantle compatible elements of Mg, Cr, and Ni, indicating that they are a type of primitive magma. This finding, along with the newly determined relationship with the Northland Volcanic Arc means that <b>North</b> <b>Cape</b> intrusions represent a composition very close to the original subduction generated magma chamber that produced the Miocene-aged arc volcanism that has migrated southwest down the North Island and continues at its current location at the Taupo Volcanic Zone.
