40|$|Referring {{to studies}} of peasant society and {{behavior}} and utilizing information from field research conducted in Turkey, {{this article examines}} assumptions <b>national</b> <b>administrators</b> make about rural areas and peasants in the formulation and the implementation of rural development programs. It is observed that <b>national</b> <b>administrators</b> tend to: 1) think of villages in terms of stereotypes which may bear little relationship to those which are targets of policies; 2) treat villages as undifferentiated clusters whereas many programs may produce different consequences for different segments of village society; 3) formulate programs without substantive familiarity w i t h the field; 4) be concerned with only those consequences of policies {{in which they are}} interested, whereas others may in fact determine the chances of success or failure of projects; 5) explain failure of peasants to behave in expected directions as being irrational, whereas the lattersl behavior may serve their purposes quite well. It is argued that the modification of these assumptions, which necessitate greater familiarity with peasant thinking, behavior, and the characteristics of village society on the part of administrators, would serve to improve the chance of success of rural development programs.

Assessors are required to attend training, pass an exam and complete two supervised assessments before they receive full accreditation. While there are no formal pre-requisites to attend the training, most Assessors have experience in the building services, property or energy management industries. Building owners and tenants can use the online 'self-assessment' tool, however they cannot promote these results.
