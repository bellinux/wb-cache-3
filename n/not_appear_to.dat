5|$|After the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, government {{scrutiny of}} train and airplane passengers substantially increased, but bus passengers are largely free of it.

5|$|Apathetic agnosticism: The {{view that}} no amount of debate can prove or {{disprove}} the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they do <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be concerned about the fate of humans.

5|$|B.spinulosa does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> {{be under}} threat. It is {{resistant}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, which poses {{a major threat}} to many other Banksia species; and its wide distribution protects against the threat of habitat loss due to land clearing. As a result, it does not appear on the list of threatened Australian plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E
5|$|Birth control also {{improves}} child {{survival in}} the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies. In this population, outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery. Delaying another pregnancy after a miscarriage however does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is known}} to affect several {{different}} biological targets. It often {{is described as a}} norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and is also a nicotinic antagonist. However, bupropion does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have significant dopaminergic actions in humans under normal clinical circumstances. Chemically, bupropion belongs to the class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants such as cathinone and amfepramone, and to phenethylamines in general.|$|E

5|$|Chronic {{prostatitis}} in {{the forms}} of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and chronic bacterial prostatitis (not acute bacterial prostatitis or asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis) may cause recurrent urinary tract infections in males.

5|$|Colletid bees of {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis {{within the}} genus Leioproctus exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of {{many species of}} Persoonia. Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers, but do <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be effective pollinators. The fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos and possums, as well as currawongs and other large birds.|$|E

5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile.

The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} average length of the human menstrual cycle {{is similar to that of}} the lunar cycle, in modern humans there is no {{relation}} between the two.

5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation did <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be significant in the development of homosexuality.

Homosexual women {{were more likely to have}} their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
