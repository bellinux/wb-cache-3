5|$|The {{first stage}} of {{construction}} is being undertaken {{as part of the}} NorthLink WA project. Tonkin Highway's northern section will be grade separated, and a dual carriageway will be constructed from the Northern end of Tonkin Highway near Reid Highway, past Ellenbrook and through the Swan Valley to an interchange with Great Northern Highway and a <b>new</b> <b>part</b> of Brand Highway, with the extension continuing on as Great Northern Highway. The previously planned route of the bypass, prior to 2012, followed Lord Street, east of Whiteman Park. The project is funded by both the state and federal governments. Construction began in June 2017, and is scheduled to finish mid 2019.|$|E
5|$|Crysta is a fairy with {{a curious}} nature living in FernGully, a {{pristine}} rainforest free from human intervention. The fairies of FernGully {{once lived in}} harmony with humans, but believe them to have gone extinct after having been driven away by a dark spirit named Hexxus. Crysta is the apprentice of Magi, a motherly-figure fairy who imprisoned Hexxus in a tree. One day Crysta explores a <b>new</b> <b>part</b> of the forest and meets Batty, a bat {{who claims to have}} been experimented on by humans, giving him an obstreperous and unstable personality. However, fairies refuse to believe him, except for Crysta, who volunteers to investigate the situation. She sees Zak, a young lumberjack whom Crysta accidentally shrinks when she tries to save him from being crushed by a falling tree, though does not know how to restore him to normal size.|$|E

25|$|The 7th-century {{town was}} centred near the quay. Towards 700 AD, Frisian potters from the Netherlands area settled in Ipswich {{and set up}} the first {{large-scale}} potteries in England since Roman times. Their wares were traded far across England, and the industry was unique to Ipswich for 200 years. With growing prosperity, in about 720 AD a large <b>new</b> <b>part</b> of the town was laid out in the Buttermarket area. Ipswich was becoming a place of national and international importance. Parts of the ancient road plan still survive in its modern streets.|$|E
25|$|She had {{not said}} {{where she was}} to be buried and the family chose what is now the Ascension Parish burial ground, as it was the nearest one to their home.

This was not possible in the <b>new</b> <b>part</b> of the cemetery, so the site finally obtained – after negotiation with Ely diocesan authorities – was that of an old grave, corner-to-corner with the plot where Wittgenstein had been buried half a century before.|$|E

25|$|For reasons {{which remain}} unclear, in 1869 Wagner republished the essay with an {{addendum}} {{as long as}} the original, and under his own name. The first part was reprinted as in 1850, with some references toned down, as in the example already given. With a confidence lacking in the original frenetic effort, the second (<b>new)</b> <b>part</b> seeks to contextualise Wagner’s anti-Jewish feelings in the setting of later nineteenth-century German politics, whilst continuing to snipe at the dead Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer and bringing in other dead musicians, including Schumann, on Wagner’s side. He also attacked by name the critic Eduard Hanslick, bringing in reference to the latter's Jewish descent (which Hanslick then attempted to deny).|$|E

25|$|LaHarpe, in {{addition}} to supporting the independence of subject states in Switzerland, also played a large part in shaping the French Revolutionary period. Republican government, having only recently taken root in France, was a very <b>new</b> <b>part</b> of the European political sphere, {{and the creation of}} the Helvetic Republic marked a continued spread of republican ideas in practice. While short lived, the work of LaHarpe contrasted the situations in the German states, and of the Austrian Hapsburg regime at the time. While this republic was met with poor response by the Swiss people, the ideas and structure of its government contributed to the shaping of the political conditions and respective governments of the nation-states of the 1800s, especially Germany and Italy.|$|E
25|$|Valve {{announced}} a 190-page digital comic {{that has been}} revealed in four parts in {{the weeks leading up}} to the release of The Sacrifice. Part one was released on September 14, 2010, with a <b>new</b> <b>part</b> scheduled for release each week until The Sacrifices October 5 release. The comic is illustrated by Mike Oeming, the artist behind the Powers comic series, and tells the stories of the original four survivors, as well as the events leading up to the infection. The comic begins with Bill, having just sacrificed himself to save the others, taking on three tanks while severely wounded. It then cuts to the finale of Blood Harvest, which is revealed to be one week earlier. In The Sacrifice DLC, any player, whether playing as Bill or not, can choose to sacrifice themselves to allow the other survivors to complete the campaign.|$|E
25|$|Pre-1973 foreign {{works of}} other {{countries}} initially were not covered by copyright in Russia. That changed with federal law 72-FL of August 8, 2004, which brought the Russian copyright law in full compliance with the Berne Convention. Since then, foreign works subject to the Berne Convention are copyrighted in Russia if they were copyrighted in the source country when Russia joined the Berne convention (i.e., in 1995). Russia implements {{the rule of the}} shorter term: the copyright term of a foreign work in Russia is the shorter of the copyright term in the source country and the normal 70-years p.m.a. accorded by Russian law. This situation remained unchanged with the entry in force of the <b>new</b> <b>Part</b> IV of the Russian Civil Code which included a complete rewrite of the copyright law; article 1256 embodies the amendments from law 72-FL.|$|E

For 10 years, it sufficed for the accommodation {{of the students and}} the professors of the Sinsinawa College for Boys, the Brothers occupying a frame house situated near by. The Board of Trustees, Rev. T. Jarboe, president; Rev. A. O. Walker, vice-president; Rev. S. Mazzuchelli, secretary; Rev. J. Polking, Rev. T. L. Power, and Rev. Benedict Fortune, members, at their annual meeting resolved, on September 3, 1855, to erect the west end of the college building according to the original plan. On September 7, 1857, the Board of Trustees authorized the president of the college, Rev. T. Jarboe, to furnish the <b>new</b> <b>part</b> of the building in accordance with the requirements of an increased number of students. The west end of the rock {{building was}} first occupied in the fall of 1857. Another 10 years passed, and then there began a new chapter in the school's history.|$|E
