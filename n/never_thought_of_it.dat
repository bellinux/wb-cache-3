500|$|Over $11million {{has been}} spent on the {{rehabilitation}} of Taliesin since 1998. Unfortunately, its preservation is [...] "fraught with epic difficulties", because Wright <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{as a series of}} buildings with a long-term future. It was built by inexperienced students, without solid foundations. Financing renovations has been challenging because revenue from Taliesin visitation has been lower than projected.|$|E
2500|$|Jo Ann Compton's {{daughter}} Laurie Ann {{was stabbed}} to death in 1988—and a decade later, the mom was tangled in her grief. [...] "I hope they're in the same hell I'm in," [...] she said of her daughter's murderers on a 1998 show. Oprah brought in Dr. Phil to help Jo Ann. He {{asked her if she}} thought her daughter would want her to be in so much pain—and Compton said no. [...] "Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life," [...] Phil continued. [...] "She lived for 18 vibrant years, and you focus on the day she died." [...] After a moment, Compton uttered her breakthrough sentence: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> that way." [...] Later, she sobbed while revealing that she had been planning to end her life after the show. When Compton returned to the show in 2011, she had a new viewpoint on the daughter she lost: [...] "She continues to stay alive every time I do something positive." [...] Compton's surviving daughter, Cindy, said [...] "She went from existing to living. It was an amazing transformation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's pretty clear," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> before. But it don't {{mean they}} must have helped somebody, does it? Seems to me that 'never helped nobody' just {{naturally}} fails to say {{whether or not they}} helped somebody. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> before, and I'll never say it again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bose {{planned to}} [...] "perfect his coherer" [...] but <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{patenting}} <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|MAZZINI. What a very witty {{application}} of the expression I used! I should <b>never</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so," [...] assented the trapper, {{after a few}} moments' consideration, [...] "though I <b>never</b> quite <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in {{that light}} before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay,' {{said the}} father, turning aside, 'I don't think I'm against it. I've <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> But--But Emmie's the youngest.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By jove, you've struck {{about the}} {{brightest}} scheme on record. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> before. Let's get a match on with Wrykyn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's right!' said Mr Boffin. 'Come! That's sensible. And don't {{be thankful}} to us (for we <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it),</b> but to Mr Rokesmith.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That little, thing's at {{the bottom}} <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all,' he mused; 'Irene'd <b>never</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> herself.' James {{was a man of}} imagination.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{put your}} hand on me, though,' he said. 'You shouldn't have done that, and then I should <b>never</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> You shouldn't have touched me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>never</b> ha' <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> by myself," [...] {{said the}} farmer; [...] "but I think they'd {{make a very}} nice couple, and I'm sure Mrs. Driver thinks so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{she grew}} up in Coniston," [...] {{answered}} Cynthia. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> before, but of course you must have known her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, he's {{in heaven}} now!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "it's funny I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> before." [...] Of course she {{referred}} to Mr. Bentley.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> when I told her, or of her {{interest}} in the kennel; but, by George, she soon broke off her engagement." ...|$|E
60|$|While conversing, Wayne made note of {{the fact}} that the other girls studiously left him to Miss Huling. If the {{avoidance}} had not been so marked, he would <b>never</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|LADY (naively {{concerned}} about him). Oh, I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that. <b>It</b> was brutal <b>of</b> me; but I couldn't help it, could I? How else could I {{have got the}} papers? (Supplicating.) General: you will save him from disgrace.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{think what}} had {{happened}} to my watch," [...] he said. [...] "I missed it on the day after that burglary here, but I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> thinking <b>it</b> had been collared by a professional. I thought I must have lost it somewhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I shall, to-night: I must {{consult the}} archdeacon about this weary hospital. Ah me! I wish I had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me! {{all this}} may be true, but I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> before. I never thought that these {{hard-working}} people had any ideas of taste!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why,' he said, 'Great Scott, I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> before. If we jellygraph it, our handwriting'll be recognized, {{and that}} will give the whole show away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should <b>never</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> had not my worthy father {{suggested}} the idea," [...] replied Lucien, with a smile, as {{he removed the}} rope from the neck of his sire.--"Forgive me, father, if I have played my part too roughly--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was doubtless a {{beautiful}} life," [...] answered the priest, with simple indifference. [...] "But I <b>never</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> with regret, because I have been preoccupied with other ideas {{than those of}} social pleasures, though perhaps they were no wiser." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That {{was a good}} plan, señor,” Pita said. “I should <b>never</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> I {{did think}} of {{shooting}} an arrow across to the trees, but I saw that the jerk would be so great that it would tear the raft to pieces.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really you quite pain me, John Milton," [...] said Grant, {{looking up}} as he {{tightened}} a buckle. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> before, but you're right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{how true}} that is," [...] he said, [...] "and I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Sir, {{you have an}} intellect beyond the common. You will make a name." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY CICELY (naively). Bless me, that's quite true; and I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it!</b> Oh, {{after that}} you really must do all you can to help Captain Brassbound.|$|E
6000|$|Well, she didn't {{know what}} to say, that's a fact. You see, she <b>never</b> [...] <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in that light before. All she could say was, [...] "Well, [...] people have got reason, anyway, and turkeys have only got instinct; so [...] there!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> before, but I {{have taken}} your word for gospel. It {{is very good}} to have an eye for such things,--as you have, Paul. But I fancy that taste comes with, or at any rate forebodes, an effete civilization.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Lupin said he amazed her. She was {{astonished}} {{how he could}} say such things. She had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} I must expect trials, uncle. Marriage {{is a state}} of higher duties. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as mere {{personal}} ease," [...] said poor Dorothea.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's YOU who've {{put this}} into her head!" [...] she exclaimed, in a ferment of horror. [...] "She'd <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> herself. You've made her do it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Quite so, Mr. Sampson; but I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Let me see.' He {{took the}} printed paper from his pocket. 'How am I {{to answer all}} these questions?' ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} he became sombre. He <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> writing. <b>It</b> took him all his time to watch incessantly the loading of the ship by a rascally Chinese stevedore. In this Mr. Burns gave me the {{first glimpse of the}} real chief mate's soul which dwelt uneasily in his body.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Uncle, {{but take}} all the credit to yourself, for I <b>never</b> should have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> if you had not {{proposed}} the plan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That has {{certainly}} done me {{a world of}} good," [...] the farmer said when he had dressed himself. [...] "I don't say the stiffness has all gone, but I certainly don't feel any worse than I did when I got to your camp. I should <b>never</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> myself." ...|$|R
