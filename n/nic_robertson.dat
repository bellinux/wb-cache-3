50|$|<b>Nic</b> <b>Robertson</b> and {{cameraman}} Khalil Abdallah of CNN recorded an on-camera {{interview with}} her on April 6, an interview arranged by Al-Saadi Gaddafi, one of Gaddafi's seven sons. He made his office available and sent a car for al-Obeidi. Transmission of the interview was delayed by 18 hours because Saadi Gaddafi wanted the Libyan government to review it. A spokesman did {{look at it and}} was heavily critical, but Gaddafi waved that off, according to Robertson. It was first broadcast on April 7, the first time al-Obeidi had been seen by the wider public since March 26. Ten seconds of the interview—during which al-Obeidi expressed support for people in the rebel-held east of the country and in Misrata—triggered an objection from Gaddafi. Al-Obeidi did not consent to her comments being removed, and said if they were, she would withdraw consent for the entire interview, but she later agreed to the removal so long as the interview made clear which comments had been cut.|$|E
50|$|On 28 March, at noon, Gaddafi's forces began bombarding {{the city}} again.

Just before evening, international journalists arriving from Tripoli confirmed that Misrata's suburbs, including Tripoli Street, were under government control. A military officer stated that there were still about 100 rebels left, and that fighting was concentrated around {{the center of the}} town. CNN's <b>Nic</b> <b>Robertson</b> reported that the streets of Misrata were largely empty, except for about 100 pro-Gaddafi supporters demonstrating, and a strong military presence. Al Jazeera's Anita McNaught said that the furthest point in Misrata that she and other international journalists were taken to was the south side of Tripoli Street, one and a half miles from the city's center, from where gunfire could be heard. The British Ministry of Defense claimed that their planes hit and destroyed two loyalist tanks and two armored vehicles near the city.|$|E
5000|$|On 28 February 2011, CBS News {{showed a}} clip of Gaddafi {{addressing}} a group of supporters in Tripoli.

[...] A day earlier, Gaddafi had told Christiane Amanpour {{in an exclusive interview}} for ABCNews that the Libyan government [...] "didn't use force to stay in power," [...] and asked her to show him [...] "a single attack, a single bomb, a single casualty". On 5 March 2011, he told CNN's <b>Nic</b> <b>Robertson</b> in an interview that his family won't step down: [...] "I am the government. If we would hold tomorrow election (sic!) my father would win with a big majority". Saif further told CNN that the world should not worry about the [...] "200, 300 even 1000 militia...because now everybody is armed in Libya." [...] In an interview with Benjamin Harvey from Bloomberg on 8 March, Gaddafi said that the crisis in Libya was [...] "a passing cloud. This is an historic opportunity for Libya to become a first- class democratic state.” ...|$|E
