50|$|Leszek Hadrian {{the head}} of Musical Theater in Lublin {{was the first one}} to come up with the idea <b>of</b> the <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Culture. He claimed it to be a 'demonstration of culture'. Apart from that, the <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Culture was an {{opportunity}} and help at the same time for Lublin in achieving the title of 2016 European Capital of Culture. To date, many of the artistic and community centres in the city have joined the <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Culture. <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Culture should not be mistaken for the Long <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Museums. The <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Museums is a separate event which takes place in many different cities in Poland, whereas the <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Culture is unique and takes place only in Lublin.

5|$|According to Callisthenes, the Persians {{were using}} water clocks in 328 {{to ensure a}} just and exact {{distribution}} of water from qanats to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in Iran, especially in Zeebad, dates back to 500. Later they were also {{used to determine the}} exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the Nowruz, Chelah, or Yaldā – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and <b>nights</b> <b>of</b> the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the award Braham was out celebrating at a pub. He attempted {{to drive home}} whilst intoxicated and crashed into a traffic island. Although drinking and driving was not a criminal offence, the police charged him with damaging public property and fined him £5, {{the equivalent of a}} weeks wages. It was his third car crash.

50|$|The 2007 {{event was}} {{promoted}} as Vengeance: <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Champions and featured all WWE titles being defended. In 2008, the event dropped the Vengeance name {{and continued to}} promote as <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Champions, later moving to September in 2010. In 2011, WWE scheduled both a <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Champions and Vengeance event where the latter name would replace WWE Bragging Rights on the October 2011 event card while <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Champions retained its original slot. In 2012, the Vengeance name {{was removed from the}} scheduled event calendar for that year. For many years, the 2001-07 Vengeance and <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Champions events were considered a continuation of each other but as of 2016, WWE considers the 2007 Vengeance: <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Champions as the only connection between the two events as it is listed on both Vengeance and <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Champions history pages. On the archives of their website, WWE Vengeance 2001-07 and 2011 are listed under the Vengeance chronology and <b>Night</b> <b>of</b> Champions is now considered as taking place from 2007-2015. Because of the direct link of the events from the 2007 crossover name, this page reflects both events.|$|R
