The project was abandoned in 2002 for a <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> enforced local law, {{under the terms}} of which dog owners can be fined up to €500 for not removing their dog faeces. The air pollution in Paris, {{from the point of view}} of particulate matter (PM10), is the highest in France with 38µg/m³.|$|E
5|$|The BCG vaccine has limitations, and {{research}} {{to develop new}} TB vaccines is ongoing. A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials. Two main approaches {{are being used to}} attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines. One approach involves adding a subunit vaccine to BCG, while the other strategy is attempting to create <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> live vaccines. MVA85A, an example of a subunit vaccine, currently in trials in South Africa, is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus. Vaccines are hoped to {{play a significant role in}} treatment of both latent and active disease.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church teaches that, {{immediately}} after death, {{the soul of}} each person will receive a particular judgement from God, based on their sins {{and their relationship to}} Christ. This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement, according to the church's teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of both a <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness.|$|E

25|$|In {{later years}} Potsdamer Platz was served by both of Berlin's two local rail systems. The U-Bahn arrived first, from the south; begun on 10 September 1896, it opened on 18 February 1902, with a <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> sited station being {{provided}} on 29 September 1907, and the line itself being extended north and east on 1 October 1908.

25|$|RFC {{casualties}} {{increased in}} mid-September, {{due to a}} German reorganisation of air units according to function, Kampfeinsitzer units were combined into seven bigger Jagdstaffeln (Jastas, fighter squadrons) with <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> Albatros D.Is and hand-picked pilots, trained at Valenciennes in new tactics based on the Dicta Boelcke. The first of the new aircraft for Jasta 2 arrived on 16 September. A modest technical superiority and better tactics enabled German aircrew to challenge Anglo-French air supremacy but the more manoeuvrable British fighters, greater numbers and aggressive tactics, preventing the Germans from gaining air superiority.|$|E
25|$|This period {{also saw}} the {{beginning}} of the feud between French and Smith-Dorrien, his successor at Aldershot with whom he had been on relatively cordial terms {{at the end of the}} Boer War. Smith-Dorrien annoyed French by insisting that cavalry improve their musketry, by abolishing the pickets which trawled the streets for drunken soldiers, by more than doubling the number of playing fields available to the men, by cutting down trees, and by building <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> barracks. By 1910 the feud was common knowledge throughout the Army. Smith-Dorrien, happily married to a young and pretty wife, also objected to French’s womanising.|$|E
25|$|Roberts (now Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in London) ordered French {{to convene}} a {{committee}} to report on cavalry tactics; French replied (15 September 1901) that he was consulting his regimental commanders, and accepted that cavalry should fight dismounted with firearms, but that they needed a <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> sword. French was appointed (23 October 1901) to command 1st Army Corps at Aldershot, {{in place of the}} disgraced Buller. French wrote to thank Roberts, to whose recommendation he guessed – correctly – that he owed the job, but also wrote to Buller, stressing that he had not been offered the position, but had been appointed to it by the King (i.e. suggesting that he had had little option but to accept).|$|E

25|$|Kurzweil {{explains}} that in 1999 computers {{are essential to}} most facets of life, yet he predicts no major disruption related to the then-pending Y2K problem. He says computers are narrow-minded and brittle so far, but suggests in specific domains they are showing signs of intelligence. As examples Kurzweil cites computer generated or assisted music, and tools for the automatic or semi-automatic production of literature or poetry. He shows examples of paintings by AARON as programmed by Harold Cohen which can be automatically created. Kurzweil reviews some of his predictions from The Age of Intelligent Machines and various past presentations, and is very pleased with his record. Finally he predicts a new Luddite movement as intelligent machines take away jobs, although he predicts {{a net gain of}} <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> jobs.|$|E
25|$|During the American Civil War (1861–1865), {{the city}} was {{affected}} by its history of strong commercial ties to the South; before the war, half of its exports were related to cotton, including textiles from upstate mills. Together with its growing immigrant population, which was angry about conscription, sympathies among residents were divided for both the Union and Confederacy at the outbreak of war. Tensions related to the war culminated in the Draft Riots of 1863 by ethnic white immigrants, who attacked black neighborhood and abolitionist homes. Many blacks left the city and moved to Brooklyn. After the Civil War, the rate of immigration from Europe grew steeply, and New York became the first stop for millions seeking a <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> life in the United States, a role acknowledged by {{the dedication of the}} Statue of Liberty in 1886.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{spent the}} years 1702–06 in a {{protracted}} struggle with Augustus II the Strong; {{he had already}} inflicted defeat on him at Riga in June 1701 and took Warsaw the following year, but trying to force a decisive defeat proved elusive. Russia withdrew from Poland {{in the spring of}} 1706, abandoning artillery but escaping from the pursuing Swedes, who stopped at Pinsk. Charles wanted not just to defeat the Commonwealth army but to depose Augustus, whom he regarded as especially treasonous, and have him replaced with someone who would be a Swedish ally, though this goal proved hard to achieve. After years of marches and fighting around Poland he finally had to invade Augustus' hereditary Saxony to bring him out of the war. In the treaty of Altranstädt (1706), Augustus was indeed forced to step down from the Polish throne, but Charles had lost a valuable time advantage over his main enemy in the east, Peter I, who had had the time to recover and build up a <b>new</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> army.|$|E

This full-fledged 802.11i standard (which uses WPAv2) however does require the newest hardware (unlike WPAv1), thus potentially requiring the purchase of new equipment. This new hardware required may be either AES-WRAP (an early version of 802.11i) or the <b>newer</b> <b>and</b> <b>better</b> AES-CCMP-equipment. One should make sure one needs WRAP or CCMP-equipment, as the 2 hardware standards are not compatible.|$|R
