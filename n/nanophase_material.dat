As an example, the current average lifetime of an orthopedic implant (such as hip, knee, ankle, etc.) is only 10 to 15 years. Clearly, such conventional materials (or those materials with constituent dimensions greater than 1 micron) have not invoked suitable cellular responses to regenerate enough bone to allow these devices {{to be successful}} {{for long periods of}} time. In contrast, due to their ability to mimic the dimensions of constituent components of natural bone (like proteins and hydroxyapatite), <b>nanophase</b> <b>materials</b> may be an exciting successful alternative orthopedic implant <b>material.</b> <b>Nanophase</b> <b>materials</b> are defined as materials with constituent dimensions (and/or associated surface features) less than 100 nm in at least one direction.

40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} the rapid {{onset of the}} carbon isotope {{excursion}} (CIE) at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary (V 55 Ma) may have resulted from the accretion of {{a significant amount of}} 12 C-enriched carbon from the impact of a V 10 km comet, an event that would also trigger greenhouse warming leading to the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum and, possibly, thermal dissociation of seafloor methane hydrate. Indirect evidence of an impact is the unusual abundance of magnetic nanoparticles in kaolinite-rich shelf sediments that closely coincide with the onset and nadir of the CIE at three drill sites on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. After considering various alternative mechanisms that could have produced the magnetic nanoparticle assemblage and by analogy with the reported detection of iron-rich <b>nanophase</b> <b>material</b> at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary, we suggest that the CIE occurrence was derived from an impact plume condensate.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. An investigation {{has been made}} into the differences in vibrational entropy between two states of a material. These vibrational entropy differences have been measured experimentally by low-temperature calorimetry for several alloy systems. The results from the calorimetry experiments have been compared with phonon densities of states (DOS) for the two states of the material obtained from inelastic neutron scattering data. The systems which have been examined are [ [...] . ], and nanophase [ [...] . ]. The difference in vibrational entropy between chemically disordered and [ [...] . ]-ordered [ [...] . ] was measured by calorimetry to be [ [...] . ] /atom at high temperatures, with the ordered alloy having the lower vibrational entropy. Analysis of the vibrational modes of the ordered and disordered alloys with a Born-von Karman model showed that the lower vibrational entropy of the ordered alloy originates from high-frequency optical modes involving large-amplitude vibrations of the aluminum-rich sublattice. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements were performed on powdered [ [...] . ]. The alloy was prepared in two states of chemical order: 1) with equilibrium [ [...] . ] order, and 2) an fcc solid solution prepared by high- energy ball milling. The main difference in the phonon DOS of the ordered and disordered alloys occurs near 39 meV, the energy of a peak arising from optical modes in the ordered alloy. These high-frequency optical modes involve primarily the vibrations of the aluminum-rich sublattice. The difference in vibrational entropy of disordered and ordered [ [...] . ] kB/atom at high temperatures. The difference in heat capacity of chemically disordered and [ [...] . ] ordered [ [...] . ] was measured by calorimetry from 70 K - 300 K. By comparing these measured results to a harmonic heat capacity calculated with a Born-von Karman model, we estimate the difference in vibrational entropy between disordered and ordered Cu 3 Au to be [ [...] . ] kg/atom at high temperatures. Samples of [ [...] . ] were prepared with two microstructures: 1) with equilibrium [ [...] . ] order, and 2) with partial disorder (having a large [ [...] . ] chemical order parameter, but without the tetragonality of the unit cell). We measured the difference in their heat capacities from 60 K to 325 K and inelastic neutron scattering spectra at four values of Q at 11 K and at 300 K. We describe a microstructural contribution to the anharmonic heat capacity that originates with the anisotropy of the [ [...] . ] structure. We estimate the difference in vibrational entropy between partially-disordered and ordered [ [...] . ] to be [ [...] . ] kg/atom at high temperature. The elastic energy stored in the microstructure is about 60 J/mole at low temperatures. The difference in vibrational entropy between fcc disordered and hexagonal ordered [ [...] . ] was measured by calorimetry to be [ [...] . ] /atom at high temperatures, with the ordered alloy having the lower vibrational entropy. Neutron diffraction data revealed that the observed L 12 region of the phase diagram does not exist, but is a state that can be obtained in quenched alloys. Neutron energy loss spectra were measured for two states of nanophase Fe: 1) as-milled, with a characteristic nanocrystallite size of 12 nm, and 2) annealed, with a characteristic crystallite size of 28 nm.
