40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} three evolutionary based heuristics to the open shop scheduling problem. The intractability of this problem is a motivation for the pursuit of heuristics that produce approximate solutions. This work introduces three evolutionary based heuristics, namely, a permutation genetic algorithm, a hybrid genetic algorithm and a selfish gene algorithm, and tests their applicability to the open shop scheduling problem. Several problem instances are used with our evolutionary based algorithms. We compare the results and conclude with some observations and suggestions {{on the use of}} evolutionary heuristics for scheduling problems. We also report on the success that our hybrid genetic algorithm has had on one of the large benchmark problem instances: our heuristic has produced a better solution than the current best known solution. 1 Introduction An Open Shop Scheduling Problem (OSSP) involves a collection of m machines and a collection of <b>n</b> <b>jo</b> [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A fire {{suppression}} model {{was developed for}} forested winter range o f the Beverly and Qamanirjuaq (formerly Kaminuriak) herds o f barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) i n north-central Canada. T h e model is a balance between total protection, as voiced by some aboriginal people, and a let-burn policy for natural fires advocated by some ecologists. Elements i n the model were caribou ecology, l ichen recovery after fire, burn history, communi ty priorities for caribou hunting, and fire cycle lengths. The percent ratio o f current productive caribou habitat to the goal for that habitat determines whether fire should be suppressed i n a specific area. T h e goals for productive caribou habitat, defined as forests older than 50 years, were scaled by fire cycle length and communi ty priority ranking. Thus, the model is an example o f co-management: traditional knowledge combined wi th science i <b>n</b> a <b>jo</b> in t forum, the Beverly and Qamanirjuaq Car ibou Management Board...|$|R
50|$|The Westerner is a 1940 American film {{directed}} by William Wyler and starring Gary Cooper, Walter Brennan, and Doris Davenport. Written by Niven Busch, Stuart <b>N.</b> Lake, and <b>Jo</b> Swerling, {{the film is}} about a self-appointed hanging judge in Vinegaroon, Texas who befriends a saddle tramp who opposes the judge's policy against homesteaders. The film is often remembered for one of Walter Brennan's best performances, as Judge Roy Bean, which led to his winning his record-setting third Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. James Basevi and Stuart N. Lake also received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction, Black and White and Best Story respectively.|$|R

Caption: "Afloat at last, crippled plane is towed to Overholser ramp after salvage marathon. [...] A crippled amphibious airplane rose from Lake Overholser's muddy bottom at 2 : 30 a. m. today, and finally was maneuvered to dry land to end some 15 hours of murky, chilly labor for a crew of divers. The 30 -foot-long craft was dragged up a boat ramp on its wheels after it was extricated from the mud, raised through 12 feet of water and flipped right side up. Retrieval climaxed an adventure that began last Wednesday when the single-engine Colonial Skimmer sank while owner-pilot Art Price was making a takeoff.

This Regulation dictates new rules on the authorisation for the marketing and use of additives in feed, repealing Directive 70 / 524 /EEC (art. 23); also covers mixtures of additives sold to the end-user, and the marketing and use of those mixtures should comply with the conditions laid down in the authorisation of each single additive; defines categories of feed additives and inserts in feed additives amino acids, their salts and analogues, and urea and its derivatives, silage agents; prohibits the use of coccidiostats and histomonostats as additives until 31 december 2012 and the use of antibiotics different from coccidiostats and histomonostats until 31 december 2005; dictates a new procedures to grant the authorisations; establishes a Register of authorised feed additives; details labelling and packaging of feed additives and premixtures...|$|R

There was a great hunting up of old ribbons and finery, much cutting and pasting of gold paper, and the most {{remarkable}} quantity of straw, gray cotton, flannel, and big black beads, used by Franz and Mrs. <b>Jo.</b> <b>Ned</b> hammered at strange machines in the workshop, Demi and Tommy went about murmuring to themselves as if learning something. A fearful racket was heard in Emil's room at intervals, and peals of laughter from the nursery when Rob and Teddy were sent for and hidden from sight whole hours at a time. But the thing that puzzled Mr. Bhaer the most was what became of Rob's big pumpkin. It had been borne in triumph to the kitchen, where a dozen golden-tinted pies soon after appeared. It would not have taken {{more than a quarter of}} the mammoth vegetable to make them, yet where was the rest? It disappeared, and Rob never seemed to care, only chuckled when it was mentioned, and told his father, [...] "To wait and see," [...] for the fun of the whole thing was to surprise Father Bhaer at the end, and not let him know a bit about what was to happen.|$|R
40|$|One {{central issue}} in the {{creation}} of EMU was whether the common central bank could provide enough stability to the member countries abandoning their domestic monetary policies. In this paper, we analyze the stabilization policies of an EMU candidate country, outside and inside the monetary union, and combine the effects of short-run stabilization policies with these policies 2 ̆ 019 potential long-run repercussion on the natural rate of output. Such repercussions can emerge if the option to stabilize using domestic monetary policies leads to a permanent rise in the expected real interest rate through the anticipation by the private sector of devaluation-prone policies. We show under which conditions this argument will make it worth while to delegate monetary policy to the common central bank. Inflation targeting policies, when the target is as tight as that of the ECB, do not, in general, lead to this outcome. Instead, in contrast to the popular view, policies with the aim of targeting output, under mild conditions, lead to this conclusion. Finally, an empirical model of the real rate of interest in Sweden is estimated based on the theoretical results of the paper. 2 ̆ 013 EMU; stabilization policies; interest rate differentialYksi keskeinen tekij 4 EMUn luomisen yhteydess 4 koski sit 4, voiko yhteinen rahapolitiikka tuottaa riitt 4 v 4 sti stabilisaatiota maille, jotka luopuvat kansallisesta rahapolitiikasta.
