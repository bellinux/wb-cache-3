5|$|North of Dál Riata the Inner Hebrides were <b>nominally</b> under Pictish control {{although}} {{the historical record}} is sparse.|$|E
5|$|All this time, Bradbury {{remained}} <b>nominally</b> {{a professor}} in absentia at Stanford. The Los Alamos Laboratory was <b>nominally</b> run under a wartime contract with the University of California, but a clause in the contract allowed the University to terminate the contract {{three months after the}} end of the war. The university duly served notice, but Bradbury managed to get it rescinded, and in 1948 the contract was renewed. In 1951, he became a professor at the University of California.|$|E
5|$|Conceptually {{deriving}} legitimacy {{from the}} Diet, {{whom it is}} responsible to, the Cabinet exercises its power in two different ways. In practice, much of its power is exercised by the Prime Minister, while others are exercised <b>nominally</b> by the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Impact phase began <b>nominally</b> on June 29, 2005, {{five days}} before impact. The {{impactor}} successfully separated from the flyby spacecraft at 6:00 (6:07 Ground UTC) July 3 UTC. The first images from the instrumented Impactor were seen two hours after separation.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is {{a medium}} quality firewood, {{possessing}} less heat energy, <b>nominally</b> 5.4 MJ/m³ (18.7 million BTU (mbtu) per cord), than other hardwoods such as Ash: 7 MJ/m³ (24 mbtu/cord), Oak: 7 MJ/m³ (24 mbtu/cord), or Birch: 5.8 MJ/m³ (20 mbtu/cord).|$|E
5|$|Since {{approximately}} 1850, clarinets {{have been}} <b>nominally</b> tuned according to twelve-tone equal temperament. Older clarinets were <b>nominally</b> tuned to meantone. A skilled performer can use {{his or her}} embouchure to considerably alter the tuning of individual notes or produce vibrato, a pulsating change of pitch often employed in jazz. Vibrato is rare in classical or concert band literature; however, certain clarinetists, such as Richard Stoltzman, use vibrato in classical music. Special fingerings {{may be used to}} play quarter tones and other microtonal intervals.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{conductivity}} {{is commonly}} observed in <b>nominally</b> undoped diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. This conductivity {{is associated with}} hydrogen-related species adsorbed at the surface, {{and it can be}} removed by annealing or other surface treatments.|$|E
5|$|The Act did not repeal any {{existing}} legislation, so {{the various}} Militia Acts {{dating back to}} the time of King Charles II remained <b>nominally</b> in force.|$|E
5|$|When Troost died on January21, 1934, Speer {{effectively}} {{replaced him}} as the Party's chief architect. Hitler appointed Speer {{as head of the}} Chief Office for Construction, which placed him <b>nominally</b> on Hess's staff.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bockscar {{returned}} to the United States in November 1945 and served with the 509th at Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico. It was <b>nominally</b> assigned to the Operation Crossroads task force, {{but there are no}} records indicating that it deployed for the tests. In August 1946, it was assigned to the 4105th Army Air Force Unit at Davis-Monthan Army Air Field, Arizona, for storage.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mu'azzam Turan-Shah alienated the Mamluks {{soon after}} their victory at Mansurah and {{constantly}} threatened them and Shajar al-Durr. Fearing for their positions of power, the Bahri Mamluks revolted against the sultan {{and killed him}} in April 1250. Aybak married Shajar al-Durr and subsequently took over the government in Egypt {{in the name of}} al-Ashraf II who became sultan, but only <b>nominally.</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} {{positions}} were <b>nominally</b> {{appointed by the}} Emperor and their holders were answerable directly to him. Nevertheless, from 1936 the Japanese Army and Navy held, effectively, a legal right to nominate (or refuse to nominate) their respective ministers. Thus, they could prevent the formation of undesirable governments, or by resignation bring about the collapse of an existing government.|$|E
5|$|Although the Hong Kong {{government}} has enacted legislation which <b>nominally</b> protects migrant workers, recourse is time-consuming {{and the costs}} considerable. The legal process {{can take up to}} 15 months to reach the District Court or Labour Tribunal, during which workers have no income.|$|E
5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, a stub {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, <b>nominally</b> quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit <b>nominally</b> quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E
5|$|Bengal Subah {{was one of}} {{the wealthiest}} parts of the Mughal empire. As the Mughal empire began to decline, the Nawabs grew in power, {{although}} <b>nominally</b> subordinate to the Mughal emperor. They wielded great power in their own right and finally became independent rulers of the Bengal region, for all practical purposes, by the early 1700s.|$|E
5|$|British {{relations}} were also difficult with the <b>nominally</b> conquered Acadians. They resisted repeated British demands to swear oaths to the British crown, and eventually this sparked an exodus by the Acadians to Île-Royale and Île-Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island). By the 1740s, French {{leaders such as}} Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre orchestrated a guerrilla war with their Mi'kmaq allies against British attempts to expand Protestant settlements in peninsular Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|By {{the terms}} of his parole, Mallory was not {{permitted}} to hold public office, so he made a living by reopening his old law practice. <b>Nominally</b> excluded from politics, he managed to make his views known by writing letters and editorials for Florida newspapers. At first he urged acceptance of the reconstituted Union and acquiescence in the policies of Reconstruction, but he soon came out in opposition, particularly against black suffrage.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong's {{most senior}} leader, Chief Executive, is elected by a {{committee}} of 1,200 selected members (600 in 1997) and <b>nominally</b> appointed by the Government of China. The primary pillars of government are the Executive Council, Legislative Council, civil service and Judiciary.|$|E
5|$|In 480 {{with the}} death of the Western Emperor Julius Nepos, Eastern Emperor Zeno became sole Emperor of the empire. Odoacer, now ruler of Italy, was <b>nominally</b> Zeno's {{subordinate}} but acted with complete autonomy, eventually providing support to a rebellion against the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|In February 2001, Clear Channel Communications {{subsidiary}} Citicasters {{was fined}} $25,000 {{for its use}} of time brokerage agreements and litigation for unlawfully controlling Youngstown, Ohio area radio station WBTJ (101.9 FM, now WYLR); the company had also {{been the target of}} complaints for using KFJO (FM) to rebroadcast KSJO after it had <b>nominally</b> sold KFJO to minority-owned interests.|$|E
5|$|In January 1566 Sultan Suleiman I {{had ruled}} the Ottoman Empire for 46 years {{and went to}} war for the last time. He was 72 years old and, {{although}} having gout {{to the extent that}} he was carried on a litter, he <b>nominally</b> commanded his thirteenth military campaign. On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left Constantinople at the head of one of the largest armies he had ever commanded.|$|E
5|$|In later life, he {{attempted}} to have Anna Maria Luisa recognised as the universal heiress of Tuscany, but CharlesVI, Holy Roman Emperor, would not allow it because Florence was <b>nominally</b> an imperial fief, and he felt he alone could alter the Tuscan laws of succession. All Cosimo's efforts to salvage the plan foundered, and in 1737, upon his younger son's death, Tuscany passed to the House of Lorraine.|$|E
5|$|In the Iazyges' early {{relationship}} with Rome, {{they were used}} as a buffer state, being between the Romans and the Dacians. Later on this would develop into an overlord and client-state relationship, with the Iazyges being <b>nominally</b> sovereign subjects of Rome. Throughout this relationship, the Iazyges still continued their raids on Roman land, which often caused punitive expeditions to be made against them.|$|E
5|$|In the Malay Seri Rama and the Indonesian-Javanese Rama Keling, Ravana {{wants to}} possess Mandodari, {{the mother of}} Rama, but instead marries a pseudo-Mandodari, who looks like the real one. Rama's father has a union with this pseudo-Mandodari, {{resulting}} in the birth of Sita, who is <b>nominally</b> Ravana's daughter.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Magheru, {{upon the}} advice of Colquhoun, ordered the demobilization of his troops (October 10), and, {{accompanied}} by {{a few of his}} officers, passed the Southern Carpathians into Hermannstadt—at the time, the Transylvanian city was <b>nominally</b> in the Austrian Empire, but gripped by the Hungarian Revolution.|$|E
5|$|In this manner, the Emperor's modern role {{is often}} {{compared}} {{to those of the}} Shogunate period and much of Japan's history, whereby the Emperor held great symbolic authority but had little political power; which is often held by others <b>nominally</b> appointed by the Emperor himself. Today, a legacy has somewhat continued for a retired Prime Minister who still wields considerable power, to be called a Shadow Shogun (闇将軍).|$|E
5|$|On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany {{signed the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. <b>Nominally,</b> the pact was a non-aggression treaty, but it {{included}} a secret protocol {{in which the}} independent countries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania were divided into spheres of interest, with Finland falling to the Soviet sphere of interest.|$|E
5|$|On 7 December 1917 {{the last}} of the {{northern}} Sudanese troops were withdrawn from Mongalla, replaced by Equatorial troops. These southern and at least <b>nominally</b> Christian troops remained the only permanent garrison of the town and province until their mutiny in August 1955.|$|E
5|$|Riders protested {{during the}} ninth stage, a criterium in Milan. This protest was <b>nominally</b> about the overall safety {{conditions}} of the stage, and was sparked by life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before. In the protest, riders declined to contest the stage except for a final sprint finish, a decision that proved controversial with race organizers and fans.|$|E
5|$|The 1846 {{session of}} Parliament {{experienced}} a snowstorm of bills for new railways; {{many of these}} threatened to encroach on the GPK area of influence and abstract business; several schemes were promoted by the Caledonian Railway or its allies; in self-defence the GPK itself promoted numerous schemes—in fact 25 branches {{as well as a}} bill <b>nominally</b> by the K to authorise the modernisation works—to head off some of the encroachment.|$|E
5|$|The Red River Settlement was a {{community}} in Rupert's Land <b>nominally</b> administered by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), and largely inhabited by First Nations tribes and the Métis, an ethnic group of mixed Cree, Ojibwa, Saulteaux, French Canadian, Scottish, and English descent. Louis Riel was born there in 1844, near modern Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Louis Riel, Sr. and Julie Lagimodière.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} with the Skidis probably took place sometime between 1770 and 1775. It concluded with {{the defeat of the}} Skidis, who, although <b>nominally</b> conquered, remained on the Loup and continued to hunt separately from the other three bands. By 1777, the Kitkehahkis had moved back to the Republican.|$|E
5|$|The first written {{records of}} native {{life in the}} Hebrides begin in the 6th century AD with the {{founding}} of the kingdom of Dál Riata. Much of what is known of these times is the product of the monastic sites such as Iona, Lismore, Eigg and Tiree but north of Dál Riata, where the Inner and Outer Hebrides were <b>nominally</b> under Pictish control, the historical record is sparse.|$|E
5|$|The highly {{decorative}} Sicilian Baroque period lasted barely fifty years, {{and perfectly}} reflected {{the social order}} of the island at a time when, <b>nominally</b> ruled by Spain, {{it was in fact}} governed by a wealthy and often extravagant aristocracy into whose hands ownership of the primarily agricultural economy was highly concentrated. Its Baroque architecture gives the island an architectural character that has lasted into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The {{main part}} of the book, the Natural History, is {{presented}} as a compilation of 44 letters <b>nominally</b> to Thomas Pennant, a leading British zoologist of the day, and 66 letters to Daines Barrington, an English barrister and Fellow of the Royal Society. In these letters, White details the natural history of the area around his family home at the vicarage of Selborne in Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|Titanics lower decks {{were divided}} into sixteen {{compartment}}s. Each compartment was separated from its neighbour by a bulkhead running {{the width of the}} ship; there were fifteen bulkheads in all. Each bulkhead extended at least to the underside of E Deck, <b>nominally</b> one deck, or about , above the waterline. The two nearest the bow and the six nearest the stern went one deck further up.|$|E
