This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E
25|$|A {{philosophical}} {{issue in}} the study of mysticism is the relation of mysticism to morality. Albert Schweitzer presented the classic account of mysticism and morality being incompatible. Arthur Danto also argued that morality is at least incompatible with Indian mystical beliefs. Walter Stace, on the other hand, argued not only are mysticism and morality compatible, but that mysticism is the source and justification of morality. Others studying multiple mystical traditions have concluded that the relation of mysticism and morality is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as that.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> {{if it is}} important that a background object, such as a sign, be unrecognizable. The magnification of background objects also increases with focal length, so with the technique just described, there is little change in the recognizability of background objects.-number will achieve both objectives, and that using a lens of different focal length will make no difference in the result. However, a lens of longer focal length may still be of some help; because of the narrower angle of view, a slight change of camera position may suffice to eliminate the distracting object from the field of view.|$|E

25|$|The Seldon Plan was never, {{even from}} its start, kept stored {{in any form}} of paper, as the {{mathematics}} was expressed <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> equations, but of necessity as a dynamic process model. Computer technology allowed {{the development of the}} Prime Radiant, which permits not only observation of mathematics, associated papers, and related data in multi-dimensional dynamic displays, but also permits inclusion of changes, improvements, and modifications of the Plan. The Prime Radiant has had offshoot technologies to improve mathematical modelling, including the mini-radiant, which allows Speakers access to the Plan in private, for the purposes of refinement. Mini-radiants are able to access the Prime Radiants containing the Plan in real-time across radio data-networks.|$|E
25|$|When overs are lost, {{setting an}} {{adjusted}} {{target for the}} team batting second is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as reducing the run target proportionally to the loss in overs, because a team with ten wickets in hand and 25 overs to bat can play more aggressively than if they had ten wickets and a full 50 overs, for example, and can consequently achieve a higher run rate. The D/L method {{is an attempt to}} set a statistically fair target for the second team's innings, which is the same difficulty as the original target. The basic principle is that each team in a limited-overs match has two resources available with which to score runs (overs to play and wickets remaining), and the target is adjusted proportionally to the change in the combination of these two resources.|$|E
25|$|Henry Chadwick, an English {{statistician}} {{raised on}} cricket, was an influential {{figure in the}} early history of baseball. In the late 19th century he adapted the concept behind the cricket batting average to devise a similar statistic for baseball. Rather than simply copy cricket's formulation of runs scored divided by outs, he realized that hits divided by at bats would provide a better measure of individual batting ability. This is because while in cricket, scoring runs is almost entirely dependent on one's own batting skill, in baseball it is largely dependent on having other good hitters on one's team. Chadwick noted that hits are independent of teammates' skills, so used this {{as the basis for the}} baseball batting average. His reason for using at bats rather than outs is less obvious, but it leads to the intuitive idea of the batting average being a percentage reflecting how often a batter gets on base, whereas in contrary, hits divided by outs is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> to interpret in real terms.|$|E

2500|$|A key {{purpose of}} {{performing}} life cycle interpretation {{is to determine}} the level of confidence in the final results and communicate them in a fair, complete, and accurate manner.

Interpreting the results of an LCA starts with understanding the accuracy of the results, and ensuring they meet the goal of the study.

In 1815, however, New Hampshire passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred [...] "vested rights" [...] on the trustees.|$|E

2500|$|The dual covector {{field of}} the timelike unit vector field in any frame field {{represents}} infinitesimal spatial hyperslices.

[...] Indeed, it turns out that this is possible, in which case we say the congruence is hypersurface orthogonal, if and only if the vorticity vector vanishes identically. [...] Thus, while the static observers in the cylindrical chart admits a unique family of orthogonal hyperslices , the Langevin observers admit no such hyperslices.

2500|$|The spell is {{explained}} as a complicated memory-altering magic.

[...] Also, if you tried to erase the knowledge of even a simple person like a woodcutter, the nature of reality would be such that all too obvious gaps in memory would be noticed, such as how the woodcutter's wife got her food and wood if she were crippled. For this reason, some wizards came up with a workaround, using some energy to warp reality itself or at least human perception of it.
