5|$|The temple lore of Tirupunkur narrates that Shiva {{instructed}} his son Ganesha to aid Nandanar in digging {{the temple}} tank named Nandanar tirtha, after the saint. Another variant tells that Ganesha dug up the tank in the <b>night</b> <b>so</b> that Nandanar can bathe in its sacred waters before seeing Shiva in the temple.|$|E
5|$|Shabbat {{lunch is}} also an {{important}} social meal. Since antiquity, Jewish communities all over the world devised meat casseroles that begin cooking before the lighting of candles that marks the commencement of the Sabbath on Friday <b>night,</b> <b>so</b> as to comply with the religious regulations for observing the Sabbath. In modern Israel, this filling dish, in many variations, is still eaten on the Sabbath day, not only in religiously observant households, and is also served in some restaurants during the week.|$|E
5|$|By October 9, {{all of the}} French and American {{guns were}} in place. Among the American guns there were three twenty-four pounders, three {{eighteen}} pounders, two eight-inch (203mm) howitzers and six mortars, totaling fourteen guns. At 3:00pm, the French guns opened the barrage and drove the British frigate, HMS Guadeloupe across the York River, where she was scuttled to prevent capture. At 5:00pm the Americans opened fire. Washington fired the first gun; {{legend has it that}} this shot smashed into a table where British officers were eating. The Franco-American guns began to tear apart the British defenses. Washington ordered that the guns fire all <b>night</b> <b>so</b> that the British could not make repairs. All of the British guns on the left were soon silenced. The British soldiers began to pitch their tents in their trenches and soldiers began to desert in large numbers. Some British ships were also damaged by cannonballs that flew across the town into the harbor.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Sanford became {{president}} of Duke University, a position he held for the next 16 years. That helped quell student unrest over the Vietnam War early in his tenure as university president. Addressing the protests of the 1970 Kent State shootings with tolerance, choosing to not call in police to clear the roads, leading to the protesting students going back to their rooms at <b>night</b> <b>so</b> that West Campus could be reopened the next day kept the campus calm during a turbulent spring. Shortly before his tenure, on February 13, 1969, 60 student members of the Afro-American Society had occupied Duke's main administration center, the Allen Building, demanding {{the creation of a}} Black Studies program. After three days of clashes with police, they left the building peaceably February 16, when school officials agreed to the program. During his tenure, Sanford strongly opposed confrontation and a heavy police action which helped defuse racial tensions.|$|E
5|$|Major-General Hunter's flying column set {{out from}} Kassinger, a small town {{a few miles north}} of Merowe, at five-thirty the evening of July 29, marching only at <b>night</b> <b>so</b> as to avoid both the heat of the sun and the eyes of any Mahdist lookouts. There was no road or path to follow, and the terrain upon which Hunter's flying column marched was nearly nontraversable; the route alternated between broken, rocky ground and ankle-high sand, {{ultimately}} proving extremely difficult to navigate in the dark of night. Added to these difficulties was the measure of speed imposed upon the column, as the mounted Major-General Hunter and Lieutenant MacDonald drove their units to their breaking points in order to preempt Mahdist reinforcements. The column advanced until midnight, completing a march of over sixteen miles. Sleeping during the day was made impossible by the sweltering heat; only when adequate shade was found in the barren desert could the exhausted men of Hunter's flying column rest.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) becomes {{frustrated}} when Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) {{refers to}} Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) as his boss. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Gabe invite the office over to Gabe's {{house for a}} Glee viewing party. When the show starts, Michael and Gabe get into an argument over how high the volume should be. After taking turns raising and lowering the volume, Michael retreats to Gabe's bedroom, hoping that his employees will follow him there. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) has been {{having a hard time}} with getting her daughter CeCe to go to sleep at <b>night,</b> <b>so</b> Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) picks her up to try to calm her down. Pam is stunned that CeCe becomes completely quiet in Dwight's hands.|$|E

50|$|According to legend, {{the name}} derives from an {{incident}} involving St Michael's Church in Church Stowe.

5|$|The {{underground}} {{prison was}} shot in real caves left by mining at Griffith Park, in the Bronson Canyon, previously used as the Batcave and in the 1930s Flash Gordon serial. Shots of {{the interior of the}} mine were captured at <b>night</b> <b>so</b> it appeared like the setting was underground. Since Narita and his crew weren't allowed to drill holes for lights in mine shafts, illumination had to come from practical lights that appeared {{to be part of the}} set. The elevator descent into the bowels of the mine was simulated by pasting fake rocks to a canvas being cranked in the background of the scene. While Zimmerman believed Shatner would hate the fight between Kirk and his doppelgänger, the actor enjoyed the theatrical sequence, and contributed to the choreography with his knowledge of judo and karate.|$|E

Kozlovsky gained great renown throughout the Soviet Union, but was never allowed to leave its borders.|$|E
25|$|Edward Behr {{estimated}} that 30-40% {{of the male}} population of the Casbah was arrested {{at some point during}} the battle. These arrests generally took place at <b>night</b> <b>so</b> that any names revealed under interrogation could be picked up before the curfew lifted in the morning. The suspects would then be handed over to the Détachement Operationnel de Protection (DOP) for interrogation after which they would either be released or passed to a centre d'hebergement for further interrogation.|$|E
25|$|The first {{ability is}} a hormone cycle {{that reduces the}} body's urine production. At about sunset each day, the body {{releases}} a minute burst of antidiuretic hormone (also known as arginine vasopressin or AVP). This hormone burst reduces the kidney's urine output well into the <b>night</b> <b>so</b> that the bladder does not get full until morning. This hormone cycle is not present at birth. Many children develop it {{between the ages of}} two and six years old, others between six and the end of puberty, and some not at all.|$|E

50|$|Don Johnson, who {{had been}} on the Cincinnati scene for years, {{suggested}} which instrumentalists should play in the band. Von Ohlen states, “Don was the horn connection.” Pianist Steve Schmidt and bassist Michael Sharfe were already playing with Von Ohlen at the Blue Wisp, in the Steve Schmidt Trio, Wednesday through Saturday <b>nights,</b> <b>so</b> the rhythm section was easily formed.|$|R
50|$|All {{flights were}} made on moonlit <b>nights</b> <b>so</b> that visual {{navigation}} could be made by using rivers, lakes, railroad tracks, and towns as check points.

25|$|After Moses' death, God told Moses' {{minister}} Joshua {{to cross}} the Jordan with the Israelites. God would give them every place on which Joshua stepped, from the Negev desert to Lebanon, from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean Sea. God enjoined Joshua {{to be strong and}} of good courage, for none would be able to stand in his way, as God would lead him all of his life. God exhorted Joshua strictly to observe God's law, and to meditate on it day and <b>night,</b> <b>so</b> that he might succeed.|$|E

The besieging army arrived soon after and began to open trenches on 11 October, supported by canon fire from the sea by English ships. The besiegers however suffered from the Spanish artillery fire during the installation of wicker filled gabions, trenches and artillery emplacements. They also {{had to cope with}} sorties from the Spanish bastions, day and <b>night,</b> <b>so</b> that the siege positions were not permanently positioned.|$|E
