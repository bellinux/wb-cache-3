5|$|On the ground, it {{appeared}} that Virginia Tech had the edge in experience, forcing Georgia's defense to concentrate on stopping Tech's run game. Virginia Tech running back Branden Ore suffered an ankle injury in the Hokies' regular-season game against Wake Forest, but still took {{the field in the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl. The same could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for Georgia, whose original starting running back, Thomas Brown, suffered a season-ending knee injury in October. Filling his role were two inexperienced players: Kregg Lumpkin and Danny Ware. Making up for this inexperience, the two players were coached by Tony Ball, a former Virginia Tech wide receivers coach with insights into the Tech defense.|$|E
25|$|Formed {{out of the}} Society for the Reformation of Pashtuns (Anjuman-e-Islah-e-Afghan), it {{initially}} targeted social reformation {{and launched}} campaigns against prostitution. Bacha Khan as its founder seemed {{to be influenced by}} the realisation that whenever British troops were faced with an armed uprising they eventually always overcame the rebellion. The same could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> when using non violence against the troops.|$|E

5000|$|Monier Williams Dictionary defines Vārttikakāra as a {{composer}} of vārttikas. A vārttika {{is defined as}} a single remark or a whole work attempting to present a detailed commentary. The word vārttik- derives from , either in the sense of 'the turning (...) of sūtra-formulation into a fully worded paraphrase' or, in the sense of 'procedure (of the teaching)'. [...] According to the Indian tradition, the purpose of a vārttika is to enquire into what has <b>been</b> <b>said</b> (ukta), what has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> (anukta), and what has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> clearly (durukta).|$|R

25|$|The Ottoman Empire {{ruled in}} {{accordance}} to Islamic law. As such, the People of the Book (the Christians and the Jews) had to pay an extra tax to fulfil their status as dhimmi and in return were guaranteed religious autonomy. While the Armenians of Constantinople benefited from the Sultan's support and grew to be a prospering community, the same could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> about the ones inhabiting historic Armenia.|$|E
25|$|The court then {{considered}} whether clause 2.1 was {{an essential}} term, breach {{of which would}} allow Burger King to terminate the contract {{on the basis of}} ordinary principles of contract law. It considered a number of other clauses which provided for various procedures if clause 2.1 were not complied with (including the grace period in clause 8.1), and held that clause 2.1 could not be considered an essential term, as it could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that Burger King would not have entered the contract without being assured of strict compliance with it.|$|E
25|$|According to halakha, all {{individual}} {{prayers and}} virtually all communal prayers may be said in any language that the person praying understands. For example, the Mishnah mentions that the Shema need <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> in Hebrew A list of prayers that must be said in Hebrew is given in the Mishna, and among these only the Priestly Blessing is in use today, as the others are prayers {{that are to be}} said only in a Temple in Jerusalem, by a priest, or by a reigning King.|$|E

25|$|During the Estado Novo authoritarian regime, {{music was}} widely {{used by the}} left-wing {{resistance}} {{as a way to}} say what could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said,</b> singing about freedom, equality and democracy, mainly through metaphors and symbols. Many composers and singers became famous and persecuted by the political police, some of them being arrested or exiled, such as Zeca Afonso, Paulo de Carvalho, José Mário Branco, Sérgio Godinho, Adriano Correia de Oliveira, Manuel Freire, Fausto, Vitorino, Júlio Pereira and some others. Their music was (and remains) mostly based on Portuguese folk music and elements of European-style singer-songwriter genres.|$|E
25|$|The main Bulgarian {{advantage}} {{was their}} strong patriotic spirit and high morale, {{as well as}} the feeling among the men that they were fighting for a just cause. The same could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> about the Serbs. Their king had misled them in his manifesto to the army, telling the Serbian soldiers that they were being sent to help the Bulgarians in their war against Turkey, and the Serbian soldiers were initially surprised to find that they were fighting Bulgarians instead. Presumably, lying to his army was King Milan's only means to mobilise and command his troops without experiencing disobedience and unrest.|$|E
25|$|Although Sweden {{kept the}} Poles and the Danes at a distance, this could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of the Russians. In the Great Northern War (1700–1721), Czar Peter the Great utterly {{destroyed}} Sweden's pretensions {{to being a}} regional superpower. In the 1721 Treaty of Nystad, Estonia and Livonia, which had again been completely devastated after {{more than twenty years}} of war, were claimed by Russia. Curonia continued to be ruled by its dukes for another three-quarters of a century, but in 1795, that region also became a Russian possession as part of the Third Partition of Poland.|$|E

25|$|The Governor {{had failed}} to take an {{accurate}} territorial census before the first election of representatives to help ensure valid results. The February 1855 census showed 36 residents in Pawnee, but 75 votes were cast there in the March 30 election, held {{at the home of}} Robert Klotz. The number reflected emigrants who had arrived within that month, and election returns indicated no illegal voters at Pawnee. But the same could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> at polling places throughout {{much of the rest of}} the territory, as more than 800 illegal votes were identified in both Lawrence and Leavenworth and more than 4,000 territory-wide.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Sir Keith Holyoake, {{a former}} National Party Prime Minister and a serving Minister of State was {{controversially}} appointed as Governor-General. It was suggested by many commentators {{that it would}} be inappropriate to entrust the office to a former party leader or anyone who is closely allied with a political party. However, despite his background, Holyoake could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to have discharged his duties in a partisan way, and he served for only three years. Since the 1970s, the Prime Minister has always confided with the Leader of the Opposition during the nomination process, in an attempt to reduce partisan influence.|$|E
25|$|While his 1934 {{book was}} treated harshly by the CPUSA, {{the same can}} <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> about Corey's 1935 effort, The Crisis of the Middle Class, which was {{received}} warmly. By now the party line had changed from the ultra-radical Third Period to a new, more inclusive effort to build bridges with liberals and non-party radicals known as the Popular Front against fascism. Corey was looked upon by the party no longer as a disreputable political transgressor with a checkered past, {{but rather as a}} prestigious intellectual ally. This ideological proximity was emphasized when Corey was chosen to edit a special issue of the CPUSA literary monthly The New Masses thematically focused upon the middle class.|$|E

25|$|Leopold fought three wars against France: the Dutch War, the Nine Years' War, and the War of the Spanish Succession. In this last, Leopold {{sought to}} give his younger son the entire Spanish inheritance, {{disregarding}} {{the will of the}} late Charles II. Leopold started a war that soon engulfed much of Europe. The early years of the war went fairly well for Austria, with victories at Schellenberg and Blenheim, but the war would drag on till 1714, nine years after Leopold's death, which barely had an effect on the warring nations. When peace returned, Austria could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to have emerged as triumphant as it had from the war against the Turks.|$|E
25|$|Mac and Rachel {{were married}} on Valentine's Day 1975. Mac {{accepted}} Jamie {{as his own}} child, but the same could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for Rachel and Mac's daughter, Iris Carrington (Beverlee McKinsey). Iris was a glamorous socialite who had left her husband, Eliot (James Douglas), and their son, Dennis (Mike Hammett), to go jet-setting. She was insanely jealous and resented Rachel, who she saw as beneath her family. The drama produced by Iris interfering in Mac and Rachel's marriage carried the show {{for the rest of}} the '70s. Iris pulled numerous schemes to drive Rachel and Mac apart, but, unfortunately for her, they often backfired. After the birth of Mac and Rachel's daughter, Amanda (Nicole Catalanotto), it was revealed that Iris was adopted, which devastated her.|$|E
25|$|Edgerton {{was born}} in Cazenovia, New York, on August 17, 1818. His parents were Amos and Zerviah (Graham) Edgerton, both of Connecticut. Zerviah was a cousin of millionaire philanthropist Anson Greene Phelps. As a child, Edgerton was so sickly and frail that burial clothes were {{prepared}} for him. Whereas the young Edgerton avoided death, the same could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for his father, a teacher by trade who had been blind for years. Amos Edgerton died when Sidney was still an infant. Left with six children to raise, Zerviah Edgerton struggled to maintain her family. By age eight, young Sidney {{was out of the}} home and working himself through school. He eventually attended the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary in Lima, New York, where his cousin taught, and where he would later become an instructor as well.|$|E

25|$|Agreeing {{with the}} Attorney General's submission, the Court of Appeal {{held that the}} {{mandatory}} death penalty satisfied the reasonable classification test {{used to assess the}} constitutionality of legislation with respect to Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Reiterating the Privy Council's holding in Ong Ah Chuan, the Court found that the 15-gram differentia used in the MDA to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to be purely arbitrary, and bore a rational relation to the social object of the MDA which was to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade. There was nothing unreasonable in the legislature concluding that a wholesale dealer operating higher up in the distributive pyramid required a stronger deterrent than smaller scale dealers. It was up to the legislature to determine where the appropriate quantitative boundary was to lie between the two classes of dealers. The Court also held that the quantity of addictive drugs trafficked was broadly proportionate to both the quantity of addictive drugs brought on to the market, as well as the likely harm suffered by society {{as a result of the}} offender's crime.|$|E
25|$|By {{virtue of}} his belief that human history and {{collective}} praxis determine whether any philosophical question is meaningful or not, Gramsci's views run contrary to the metaphysical materialism and 'copy' theory of perception advanced by Engels and Lenin, though he does not explicitly state this. For Gramsci, Marxism does not deal with a reality that exists in and for itself, independent of humanity. The concept of an objective universe outside of human history and human praxis was, in his view, analogous to belief in God. Gramsci defined objectivity {{in terms of a}} universal intersubjectivity to be established in a future communist society. Natural history was thus only meaningful in relation to human history. In his view philosophical materialism resulted from a lack of critical thought, and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to oppose religious dogma and superstition. Despite this, Gramsci resigned himself to the existence of this arguably cruder form of Marxism. Marxism was a philosophy for the proletariat, a subaltern class, and thus could often only be expressed in the form of popular superstition and common sense. Nonetheless, it was necessary to effectively challenge the ideologies of the educated classes, and to do so Marxists must present their philosophy in a more sophisticated guise, and attempt to genuinely understand their opponents’ views.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} of the Roman vicariate, as described above, rested largely on usage; it was not constructed as a compact whole at one single time. The most important ordinances respecting it were issued at various times {{during the course of}} the last two centuries, showing that for a long time the inadequacy of its organization, especially as regards the great length of time necessary for the settlement of matters brought before it, had been severely felt, more, however, by the subordinates of the vicariate than by its higher officials. It could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> that its methods of business were in any way compatible with modern ideas as to efficient management. The lack of harmony was doubly evident after the entire central administration of the Church had been reformed by the Constitution Sapienti Consilio, of 29 June 1908. During the past various difficulties had stood in the way of a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate. Not the least of these was the lack of space in the former office of the vicariate. It was not until after the purchase of the Palazzo Mariscotti near San Francesco alle Stimmate, which was assigned to the cardinal vicar and his officials and arranged for their use, that Pius X was able to carry out his long cherished plan for a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate.|$|E
