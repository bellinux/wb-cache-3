25|$|In July 2011, Rodger {{followed}} a couple he {{was jealous of}} out of a Starbucks in Goleta and threw coffee on them. In a later incident, he splashed his latte on two girls sitting {{at a bus stop}} in Isla Vista for <b>not</b> <b>smiling</b> back at him. In July 2012, Rodger purchased a Super Soaker, filled it with orange juice, and used it to spray a group playing kickball at Girsh Park.|$|E
500|$|Pausch {{then went}} to the first part of his speech, {{explaining}} his childhood dreams and how he accomplished (or tried to accomplish) them. Pausch first explained his childhood, as well as his family life in the 1960s. Pausch stated that he had a [...] "really good childhood", and, when going back through his family archive of photographs, had never found a picture of him <b>not</b> <b>smiling.</b> Some of these pictures were shown on the projection as slides, including one of him dreaming. He explained how he was inspired by the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969. Pausch then transitioned to a slide which contained a list of his childhood dreams, and explained them. His dreams were being in zero gravity, playing in the National Football League, being the author of a World Book Encyclopedia article, being Captain Kirk, being [...] "one of the guys who won the big stuffed animals in the amusement park", and becoming a Disney Imagineer.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Worf was not {{intended}} to be a regular character, as Gene Roddenberry wanted to avoid [...] "retreads of characters or races featured prominently in the original Star Trek series". Accordingly, the June 1, 1987 cast portrait did not include Worf. Several [...] "tall, slim, black actors" [...] auditioned for Worf before Michael Dorn came along, walking into the audition in character and <b>not</b> <b>smiling.</b> Not only did the Worf character become a regular on The Next Generation, he was continued on the Deep Space Nine series for several more years and talk of a spin-off Worf show continued even into the 2010s.|$|E

2500|$|The film's {{character}} designer David Krentz said, [...] "Although {{the production}} veered {{away from being}} very realistic, the animation still plays independently. The powers that be decided to add narration and voice-over to reach a wider audience and the characters became slightly anthropomorphized {{to make them more}} attractive to younger kids." [...] Palaeontologist Steve Brusatte responded to The Scotsmans prompt about the [...] "danger of anthropomorphising" [...] the dinosaurs, [...] "The voiceovers are a bit of a compromise; the dinosaurs' lips aren't moving, they are <b>not</b> <b>smiling</b> and having human-like facial expressions or anything like that... They are only anthropomorphised to a small degree and that is necessary for a film like this." ...|$|E
2500|$|In certain {{versions}} of the manuscript, {{the latter part of}} line 62 reads cui non risere parentes, meaning [...] " [...] at whom parents have not smiled". Some Virgilian scholars argue that the text should read, qui non risere parenti, meaning [...] " [...] have not smiled at their parent". This is largely because Roman rhetorician Quintilian noted in his writings that Virgil's text did in fact alternate between plural and singular forms, although he did not elaborate on which word was plural, and which was singular; some Virgilian scholars suggest that the emended word parentes is the plural form Quintilian was referring to, whereas the word hunc in line 63 is the singular form. However, Quintilian's text {{is the same as the}} supposedly [...] "corrupt" [...] Virgilian version, containing both cui and parentes. Certain scholars argue that Quintilian's original text was at one point changed to rectify it with Virgil's text, which had at that time also become corrupt. Edwin Floyd, however, rejects this hypothesis, reasoning that the argument is far too convoluted to be reasonable. He posits that the qui non risere parenti emendation strains the syntax and feebly renders the sense of the poem, as it merely speaks of a baby that is <b>not</b> <b>smiling.</b> The cui non risere parentes variation, according to Floyd, is to be preferred because it questions [...] "what sort of 'unnatural' parents these might be who would not smile on their child." [...] Other commentators disagree with Floyd. Nisbet, for instance, writes, [...] "It is clear from the structure and sense of the passage that the baby is doing the laughing and not the parents (that is to say, the cui of Virgil's manuscripts is impossible against the qui implied by Quintilian 9.3.8)." [...] He instead contends that the baby not laughing at his parents is a hint to the reader that [...] "the infant is out of the ordinary." ...|$|E

60|$|Foinet {{gave him}} a rapid glance, {{recognised}} him, but did <b>not</b> <b>smile</b> a greeting.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{returned}} the look, but did <b>not</b> <b>smile.</b> She did <b>not</b> speak, but waited for more.|$|R
60|$|Ruth laughed. She {{saw he was}} <b>not</b> <b>smiling</b> and his graveness {{gave her}} a sense of power. He had owned, with typical frankness, that she had moved him.|$|E
6000|$|I believe I spoke {{louder than}} I intended, for a silence {{followed}} my words. Fox glanced at Comyn, who {{of all of}} them at the table was <b>not</b> <b>smiling,</b> and said: ...|$|E

6000|$|Lady Montfort {{looked at}} him with a glance of curious scrutiny; <b>not</b> <b>smiling,</b> and yet not displeased.

60|$|On {{the near}} side sat a swarthy young gentleman unknown {{to either of}} the ladies. He was smiling as he spoke to his companion. A moment later and the man sitting beyond came into view.

6000|$|Sir ANTHONY Nay, but Jack, such eyes! such eyes! so innocently wild! so bashfully irresolute! not {{a glance}} but speaks and kindles some thought of love!

O, Jack, lips smiling {{at their own}} discretion; and if <b>not</b> <b>smiling,</b> more sweetly pouting; more lovely in sullenness! ...|$|E
60|$|But no. When we {{rose and}} went up {{to the head of the}} bed I saw that he was <b>not</b> <b>smiling.</b> There he lay, solemn and copious, vested as for the altar, his large hands loosely {{retaining}} a chalice. His face was very truculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur. There was a heavy odour in the room--the flowers.|$|E
6000|$|Olive listened till he {{had done}} speaking; she stood a single moment longer, and then, without a word, a glance, she rushed into the house. Ransom saw that Miss Birdseye was {{immersed}} in her letters; so he went straight to Verena and stood before her, looking far into her eyes. He was <b>not</b> <b>smiling</b> now, {{as he had been}} in speaking to Olive. [...] "Will you come somewhere apart, where I can speak to you alone?" ...|$|E

60|$|He {{wore his}} hat {{on the back}} of his head, and looked {{straight}} before him: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance, and that he was <b>not</b> <b>smiling</b> at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{bottomless}} gulf," [...] {{said the}} attorney. Captain Scarborough sat silent, with something almost approaching to {{a smile on}} his mouth; but his heart within him certainly was <b>not</b> <b>smiling.</b> [...] "A bottomless gulf," [...] repeated the attorney. Upon this the captain frowned. [...] "What is it that you wish me to do for you? I have no money of your father's in my hands, nor could I give it you if I had it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But one {{may feel}} things {{and are not}} able to do {{anything}} better for all that," [...] said Gwendolen, <b>not</b> <b>smiling</b> in return--the distance to which Deronda's words seemed to throw her chilling her too much. [...] "I begin to think we can only get better by having people about us who raise good feelings. You must not be surprised at anything in me. I think it is too late for me to alter. I don't know how to set about being wise, as you told me to be." ...|$|E
