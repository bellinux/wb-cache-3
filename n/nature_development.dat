The presented research was trying to determine the relation between the way teachers understand human <b>nature</b> and <b>development</b> (as growing, as learning, or as an interaction of genes and environment) and the way they react to aggressive students' behaviours. 289 teachers from urban secondary schools took part in the research. The way the respondents understood human <b>nature</b> and <b>development</b> was determined {{with the use of a}} questionnaire based on two other diagnostic tools used in research on educational ideologies [1] and on convictions concerning {{the origins of}} human nature [2].

50|$|The {{district}} {{is surrounded by}} multiple forests and parks. In {{the middle of the}} district, there's the Reeshofpark, which is about 60 acres of park. At the southern end, some restaurants were opened in 2011. The Reeshofpark is not considered safe at night, which caused nuisance among inhabitants. The park now has brighter lights and mobile camera control. Adjacent to the Reeshofpark, there's a <b>nature</b> <b>development</b> area, called the Dongevallei. This area was created after urban planners encountered government restrictions about natural development in the Netherlands. The Donge river had to be decanalized, and agricultural area to be excavated. From seeds buried in the deep ground of nearly a century ago, new plants (re-)originated there. Highland cattle is grazing in the area, fenced from housing to prevent escapings. The alder, which is too bitter for highland cattle, is grazed by Kempian sheep. The <b>nature</b> <b>development</b> area will be extended to Koolhoven Buiten, the la(te)st neighbourhood when ready. The Reeshofbos (formerly called Hultensche Heide) is a forest remaining in the east, which forms a part of the border with the rest of Tilburg. Huis Ter Heide (when industrial area Vossenberg counted with) and the Kaaistoep are larger forests adjacent to the Reeshof.|$|E

50|$|He {{was most}} widely {{recognized}} {{for some of}} his books. Language: Its <b>Nature,</b> <b>Development</b> and Origin (1922) {{is considered by many}} to be his masterpiece. Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles (1909-1949), concentrated on morphology and syntax, and Growth and Structure of the English Language (1905) is a comprehensive view of English by someone with another native language, and still in print, over 70 years after his death and more than 100 years after publication. Late in his life he published Analytic Syntax (1937), in which he presents his views on syntactic structure using an idiosyncratic shorthand notation. In The Philosophy of Grammar (1924) he challenged the accepted views of common concepts in Grammar and proposed corrections to the basic definitions of grammatical case, pronoun, object, voice etc., and developed further his notions of Rank and Nexus. In the 21st century this book is still used as one of the basic texts in modern Structural linguistics. Mankind, Nation and Individual: from a linguistic point of view (1925) is one of the pioneering works on Sociolinguistics.|$|E
5000|$|The Lippenbroek is {{a former}} polder in the Belgian {{freshwater}} part of the Schelde-estuary, currently functioning as a pilot project {{for the restoration of}} intertidal habitat in a densely populated estuary. [...] The area of 10 ha, situated on the territory of the Belgian community of Hamme, started functioning as a flood control area (FCA) in March 2006. Through a construction of sluices, the area is in close contact with the river Schelde: water is flowing in at high tide, and out at low tide. The sluices are designed to obtain a water regime in the area, comparable to the one in natural mudflats and (freshwater) tidal marshes along the Schelde. In this way, the Lippenbroek combines a safety function (protection against extreme spring tide) with a <b>nature</b> <b>development</b> function. In the framework of the Belgian Sigmaplan, aimed at protecting the whole river basin against floods, more areas along the Schelde will be designed similarly. The area has also been seen as a model for flood prevention internationally. The controlled reduced tide procedure has made the area an improved habitat for eels.|$|E
50|$|In the old {{industrial}} {{area of the}} Ruhr District in Germany, Duisburg-Nord is a landscape park which incorporates former industrial structures and natural biodiversity. The architects Latz + Partner developed the water park which now consists of the old River Emscher, subdivided into five main sections: Klarwasserkanal (Clear Water Canal), the Emschergraben (Dyke), the Emscherrinne (Channel), the Emscherschlucht (Gorge) and the Emscherbach (Stream). The open waste water canal of the “Old Emscher” river is now fed gradually by rainwater collection {{through a series of}} barrages and water shoots. This gradual supply means that, even in lengthy dry spells, water can be supplied to the Old Emscher to replenish the oxygen levels. This has allowed the canalised river bed to become a valley with possibilities for <b>nature</b> <b>development</b> and recreation.As {{a key part of the}} ecological objectives, much of the overgrown areas of the property were included in the plan as they were found to contain a wide diversity of flora and fauna, including threatened species from the red list. Another important theme in the development of the plan was to make the water system visible, in order to stimulate a relationship between visitors and the water.|$|E

5000|$|Abbey’s {{impression}} {{is that we are}} trapped by the machinations of mainstream culture. This is made apparent with quotes such as: “Yet history demonstrates that personal liberty is a rare and precious thing, that all societies tend toward the absolute until attack from without or collapse from within breaks up the social machine and makes freedom and innovation again possible." [...] He also believes the daily routine is meaningless, that we have created a life that we do not even want to live in:My God! I am thinking, what incredible shit we put up with most of our lives - the domestic routine (same old wife every night), the stupid and useless degrading jobs, the insufferable arrogance of elected officials, the crafty cheating and the slimy advertising of the business men, the tedious wars in which we kill our buddies instead of our real enemies back in the capital, the foul diseased and hideous cities and towns we live in, the constant petty tyranny of automatic washers and automobiles and TV machines and telephone!Abbey displays disdain for the way industrialization is impacting the American wilderness. He scolds humanity for the environmental duress caused by man’s blatant disregard for nature: “If industrial man, continues to multiply his numbers and expand his operations he will succeed in his apparent intention, to seal himself off from the natural, and isolate himself within a synthetic prison of his own making”. Man prioritizes material items over <b>nature,</b> <b>development</b> and expansion for the sake of development: There may be some among the readers of this book, like the earnest engineer, who believe without question that any and all forms of construction and development are intrinsic goods, in the national parks as well as anywhere else, who virtually identify quantity with quality and therefore assume that the greater the quantity of traffic, the higher the value received. There are some who frankly and boldly advocate the eradication of the last remnants of wilderness and the complete subjugation of nature to the requirements of--not man--but industry. This is a courageous view, admirable in its simplicity and power, and with the weight of all modern history behind it. It is also quite insane. I cannot attempt to deal with it here. Another example of this for Abbey is the tragedy of the commons: “A civilization which destroys what little remains of the wild, the spare, the original, is cutting itself off from its origins and betraying the principle of civilization itself. If industrial man continues to multiply its numbers and expand his operations he will succeed in his apparent intention, to seal himself off from the natural and isolate himself within a synthetic prison of his own making. He will make himself an exile from the earth”. He also criticizes what he sees as the dominant social paradigm, what he calls the expansionist view, and the belief that technology will solve all our problems: “Confusing life expectancy with life-span, the gullible begin to believe that medical science has accomplished a miracle—lengthened human life!” Abbey takes this theme to an extreme at various points of the narrative, concluding that: “Wilderness preservations like a hundred other good causes will be forgotten under the overwhelming pressure, or a struggle for mere survival and sanity in a completely urbanized completely industrialized, ever more crowded environment, for my own part I would rather take my chances in a thermonuclear war then live in such a world”.|$|E
40|$|The study {{presented}} here addresses theoretical, methodological and practical {{aspects of the}} issue of group differences in the aesthetic evaluation of natural landscapes. Beauty ratings of an agrarian landscape and five computer simulations of <b>nature</b> <b>development</b> plans in this landscape were collected in a field study. Three different user groups, each consisting of 28 respondents, were distinguished: farmers, residents (nonfarmers) and visiting cyclists. Ratings on predictor variables were given by the respondents themselves, as well as by a group of 12 experts on <b>nature</b> <b>development.</b> Results of multilevel statistical analysis show differences in beauty ratings of <b>nature</b> <b>development</b> plans as a function of user background. Beauty ratings of residents and visitors were positively related to typical characteristics of <b>nature</b> <b>development</b> plans (wetness, roughness and noncultivatedness), while farmers' beauty ratings were negatively related to these characteristics. In each group, beauty ratings were positively related to perceived complexity, coherence, mystery and biodiversity. However, perceptions of these characteristics were found to be highly subjective. Possible explanations of the user-group differences in terms of background variables such as familiarity and education level are discussed, as well as implications for theoretical and management concerns.

The aim of this study was to find out: Where are <b>nature</b> <b>development</b> projects located in The Netherlands, now and in the future, and what is their potential considering their current state? During this study <b>nature</b> <b>development</b> in the Netherlands has been mapped, creating a so called 'Map of Hope'.

The process of limitation, acquisition, restoration and devolution of the EHS and the nature developmental projects are behind schedule. Despite the expected increase in speed, it remains unclear whether all the goals will be achieved in 2018. Only an increase in area will not achieve the desired effect, without matching environmental improvements. Although the environmental quality has improved since the 1980 's, there are still many problems to be solved. Groundwater depletion is a serious issue all over the Netherlands. Acidification and eutrofication levels are still too high in areas of intensive cattle-breeding.
