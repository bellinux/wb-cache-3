Due to the fact that Croatia is a small open transition economy, we assume that shocks of foreign origin can have notable effects on its performance. Therefore, the original Blanchard-Perotti identification method is extended by introducing variables that represent external (foreign) demand shocks. The results show that government spending has a positive and statistically significant effect on private aggregate demand and private consumption, and that <b>net</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes</b> have a negative and statistically significant effect on private consumption and private investment. ...|$|E

40|$|Placing a {{price on}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions using an emissions tax or auctioning tradable permits provide the least cost government intervention to reduce pollution. Initial effects of the charge on pollution include {{an increase in the}} relative prices of greenhouse gas intensive products and production processes to reduce pollution, and a <b>net</b> increase in <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes</b> with a windfall boost to government revenue. There are at least three overlapping sets of economic efficiency, equity and political acceptance reasons for returning most of the windfall revenue gains to households as compensating income tax reductions and increases in social security payments as a tax mix change package. Most of the <b>indirect</b> <b>tax</b> increases will be passed onto consumers as a higher cost of living, albeit with changes in relative prices. With a likely regressive incidence, some compensation in a close to lump sum form has both equity and political acceptability claims. With no changes in market wages and nominal interest rates, the higher cost of living will further distort the effects of existing income taxes on labour and capital market decisions and their associated efficiency costs. Or, the cost of living increase will provide a catalyst for compensating increases in market wages and nominal interest rates, with the added risk of initiating an inflationary cycle. A tax mix change package has the potential to neutralise the negative effects of the associated increase in indirect taxation. Given the expected time path of increases in the pollution charge on greenhouse gas emissions, and of the windfall increase in <b>indirect</b> <b>tax</b> revenue, the details of new tax mix change package will need to be renegotiated every few years.

30|$|The SAM {{built for}} this study {{included}} sixty-four commodities and sixty-four activities, 2 four value-added components (compensation of employees, mixed income, gross operating surplus, and <b>indirect</b> <b>net</b> <b>taxes)</b> and four institutional sectors (households, firms, government, {{and the rest of}} the world). Insertion of financial accounts into the SAM requires the inclusion of flows related to capital accounts and financial asset (or liability) accounts (Emini and Fofack 2004) by each Institutional Sector. More specifically, net savings by institutional sector is a balance of incomes and expenditures. Together with net capital transfers (receivables and payables), net savings by institutional sector is used to accrue the non-financial flows (United Nations 2008). The resulting surplus or deficit is the net lending or borrowing, and this figure is the balancing item to move forward from the capital accounts to the financial accounts. In contrast, the financial accounts do not have any balancing item carried forward to other accounts.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} analyse the inflationary trends {{observed}} in Pakistan {{in the recent}} past by applying both the monetary and real theories. The former explains inflation in terms of changes in liquidity per unit of real output and velocity whereas the latter makes use of real variables, especially, the structure of economy. Since the ratio between money spending (quantity of money times velocity) and real GDP defines general price level, monetary theory offers a natural tool for analysing inflation. Even factors like raising utility prices by the government or higher expected inflation add to inflation only when the additional demand for money generated by these factors is met with an accommodating increase in money supply (with stable velocity). During FY 86 to 96 in Pakistan, money supply grew by 15. 4 percent, GDP by 5. 3 percent, and velocity by – 0. 24 percent. This yields an estimated inflation of 9. 4 percent, very close to the actual one of 9. 2 percent. Interestingly enough, {{more than half of the}} money expansion during the 90 s emanated from credit for budgetary support, rendering the latter an active source of inflation. Under the real theory, we focused on full-cost-pricing wherein the market value-added price is defined as a weighted sum of various primary costs, e. g., wages, profits, and <b>net</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes.</b> To capture the impact of terms of trade, foreign trade flows were added. It has been estimated that the overall inflation of 9. 4 percent during FY 86 – 95 was contributed to the extent of 5. 6 points by profits, 2. 2 points by wages, 0. 9 by <b>net</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes</b> and 0. 7 by terms of trade. From policy perspective, monetary analysis has an edge over real analysis as controlling inflation through monetary management is relatively easier than through regulating various costs elements which go into the formation of price. ...|$|E

40|$|Using {{comparable}} fiscal incidence analysis, {{this paper}} examines {{the impact of}} fiscal policy on inequality and poverty in 25 countries for around 2010. Success in fiscal redistribution is driven primarily by redistributive effort (share of social spending to GDP in each country) {{and the extent to}} which transfers/subsidies are targeted at the poor and direct taxes targeted at the rich. While fiscal policy always reduces inequality, this is not the case with poverty. Fiscal policy increases poverty in 4 countries using a US$ 1. 25 /day PPP poverty line, in 8 countries using a US$ 2. 50 /day line, and in 15 countries using a US$ 4 /day line (over and above market income poverty). Net direct taxes are always equalizing and <b>net</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes</b> are equalizing in 17 of the 25 countries. While spending on pre-school and primary school is pro-poor (i. e. the per capita transfer declines with income) in almost all countries, pro-poor secondary school spending is less prevalent, and tertiary education spending tends to be progressive only in relative terms (i. e. equalizing but not pro-poor).

40|$|This master thesis {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between state budgetary revenues from <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes,</b> the number of existing <b>indirect</b> <b>tax</b> rates {{and the level of}} those taxes. In particular, this thesis strives to investigate whether {{an increase in the number}} of <b>indirect</b> <b>tax</b> rates and higher tax rates lead to a measurable increase in the net tax revenue of a given state. The analysis uses tax-related data from 39 European countries collected between 1993 and 2014 and includes a total number of 746 observations. In order to arrive at the estimated results, this thesis uses the general method of moments analysis (GMM) along with the Arellano-Bond estimator. Results obtained through the GMM analysis suggest that, ceteris paribus, the introduction of one additional <b>indirect</b> <b>tax</b> rate leads to a decrease of net tax revenue of the state vis-a-vis its gross domestic product by 1, 03 percentage points. The relationship between the level of <b>indirect</b> <b>tax</b> rate and the state's net revenues appears to be non-linear.

The first two simulations showed that the policies have potential to improve income distribution, mainly benefiting the lower income families in the poorest regions. The reduction of <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes</b> over goods and services in Sao Paulo state shows that this state would benefit more compared to the other states, an example of the so called "fiscal war". This policy also points to some regressive effects of the tax policies on income distribution, since it disproportionately benefits the higher income groups located in the Sao Paulo state.

40|$|Consumer imports {{have played}} {{a vital role in}} the {{development}} of Barbados over the years. It is not difficult to see the link between these imports and <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes</b> since, when consumer items arrive into Barbados, these are subject to import duties, value-added taxes and in some cases, excise duties, all components of <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes,</b> which represent the major tax revenue category of the Government of Barbados. With rising <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes,</b> a Government can use some of these funds to develop a country’s infrastructure and enhance its development. Although some reduction in savings is expected from an expansion in consumer imports (especially if financed by a drawdown in deposits), this loss can be minimised if some of the taxes collected from such an increase are directed into foreign exchange earning activities. This paper uses regression analysis to see to what extent changes in consumer imports will influence <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes</b> in the long and short run between 1970 and 2001. The results show that in the long run, a per unit change in consumer imports will boost <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes</b> by 0. 46 % while in the short run, a similar change in consumer imports will increase <b>indirect</b> <b>taxes</b> sharply by 0. 78 %.
