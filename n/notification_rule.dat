The value of the threshold for the individual turnover is then calculated applying the theoretical framework and the estimated costs of Type I and Type II errors...|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : EthicsInternational audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the {{liability}} and duties of data controllers regarding data leaks and compares the relevant legal schemes of Japan, the U. S., and the U. K. There are three primary approaches to reducing or redressing damages caused by data leaks: (1) providing remedies for data leaks; (2) data security obligations; and (3) notification obligations {{in the event of}} a data breach. The aim of this article is to compare the measures on data breaches from the above viewpoints and highlight the relevant issues in order to reach an appropriate solution. To address the issues related to data breaches, legal rules among countries should be common to all due to the worldwide circulation of personal data. Nonetheless, different features are recognizable through the analysis in each chapter. Companies in Japan have thus far eagerly abided by data security obligations even if they are ineffective for data protection. Conducting PIAs is another option to prevent security incidents. If data breach <b>notification</b> <b>rules</b> are introduced, the subject matters to be publicized must be identified and followed by enforcement actions. Also, such rules should contribute to the avoidance of secondary harm. In the U. S., while compensations for data leakage and security breach <b>notification</b> <b>rules</b> have apparently been effectively managed, it is needed to reduce serious harm arising from massive data breach. Obliging companies to maintain data traceability might serve this. In the U. K., data breach <b>notification</b> <b>rules</b> imposed as part of the General Data Protection Regulation need to connect with other effective enforcements and contributions to avoiding secondary harm, so as not to become meaningless. We must harmonize the above differences and make ongoing efforts to improve the effectiveness of rules...|$|R

40|$|Providing quality {{information}} on health-threatening contamination incidences can improve consumer welfare, because the consumers can, and often do, take self-protective actions given the information provided. Unfortunately, important contamination information often comes from private or quasi-private sources and {{the distinction between}} private and public information is also sometimes ambiguous. Thus, the regulatory authority may need to manage private incentives of providing publicly useful information. There is no lack of literature arguing that supply of public goods is smaller than optimal when provision of those goods {{are in the hands}} of private agents seeking their own economic rents. The same argument seems to apply here [...] - private provision of publicly useful information is less or later than optimal. Though the argument makes an intuitive sense, there appears to be lack of empirical research investigating this issue. We provide one such study, examining a unique EPA dataset on the public notification enforcement and compliance for the Safe Drinking Water Act. The data contain 2, 062 observations of maximum contaminant level violation incidences in Illinois from 1980 to 2006. The dataset allows us to estimate the determinants of the observed public notification timings. More importantly, we also estimate the impact of the new public <b>notification</b> <b>rule</b> on the coefficient for the contamination severity level. The new rule, issued May 2000 and fully enforced May 2002, (i) extended the PN compliance deadline (for tier 2 violations) of 14 days to 30 days and (ii) gives the primacy agency discretion to extend the PN deadline in some appropriate circumstances. Our results are disconcerting and indicate that the new rule has had welfare-decreasing effects. With linear models, one point increase in the severity level of a contamination incidence is significantly associated with an increase in PN delay of 8 - 9 days after the new rule but is not statistically significantly associated with PN delay before the new rule. Moreover, the new rule per se increases the PN timing by 21 - 24 days, which is approximately the simple effect of the extension rule. These results were robust to other specifications, in particular, to the Tobit specifications to account for censoring issues. Our empirical results seem to suggest that even in the case of mandated public notification, private or quasi-private managers of the public water systems still make private calculation of the benefits and costs of making information public [...] - the PN timing is significantly associated with various covariates, which one should not observe if the managers were truly welfare-maximizing agents. These findings should be taken seriously in lieu of guiding future information disclosure/public notification policies. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E
40|$|Our goal is {{to provide}} a {{protocol}} and practical toolbox for communicating with stakeholders and the public about water advisories that is based upon research and identified practices. The project focuses on water systems and addresses the range of situations that generate drinking water advisories. This project was a collaborative effort among the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the American Water Works Association (AWWA), the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA), and the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA). A technical workgroup of public health and drinking water agencies and drinking water system experts advised and guided the project. The project also engaged a broad cross-section of relevant stakeholders and technical experts including local government officials and emergency response and hazard communication experts. This toolbox was reviewed by EPA and state primacy agencies. Every effort was made to ensure that the toolbox complies with the Public <b>Notification</b> <b>Rule</b> when necessary. More than 500 documents, protocols, regulations, and other resources related to the issuing of drinking water advisories were compiled. Nearly 100 interviews were conducted with water systems, primacy agencies, and local public health departments in the United States and Canada. These findings revealed: Advice to the public varies widely from state to state and community to community; Advisories are a common occurrence in some states and a rare event in others; Major events or disasters were the primary reasons for collaboration between drinking water systems and health departments; Terminology for advisories is inconsistent; Templates and advisory content are difficult to change or adapt to specific audiences or needs; The EPA Public Notification Handbook is the primary information source for drinking water advisories; Agency responsibilities for communicating with institutions, such as hospitals, schools, and restaurants, are highly variable; Good relationships between water systems and local public health departments are often dependent on established relationships between individuals; Local health departments may lack the resources or expertise to address drinking water issues; Local health departments are willing to be consulted by water systems when requested.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{provides}} an overview of the Integration Rules (IRules) approach to the interconnection of distributed software components. The intended use of this rule processing technology is for the specification of event-based processing logic in the development of component-based applications for distributed environments, such as E-commerce applications. The IRules approach builds upon the use of the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) software component model, providing an environment to facilitate the integration of black-box software components. An application integrator uses the IRules Component Definition Language to extend the definition of an EJB component in the IRules environment with derived and stored attributes, externalized relationships, and events. The application integrator then uses the IRules Integration Rule Language together with a scripting language to develop applications. Integration rules provide active rule capability to the environment so that as distributed components and external sources generate event <b>notifications,</b> integration <b>rules</b> are used to invoke methods on components or on higher-level application transactions. The IRules approach is unique in that it addresses the language and semantic framework needed in the context of software component models for the effective use of rules in distributed environments.

40|$|China {{is among}} the most recent {{entrants}} into global competition enforcement, having adopted the first competition law of general application, the Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) {{after more than a decade}} of drafting. The AML and Merger <b>Notification</b> Thresholds, <b>rules</b> issued by decree of the State Council, became effective on August 3, 2008. Both the law and the guidelines were subject to public review and comment, and went through a number of drafts before final adoption. This article is a comprehensive comparison of merger standards across jurisdictions, with particular focus on the evolution of merger regulation in China. It comprises six parts; after an introduction, part two analyzes the AML with respect to mergers, part three examines predecessor pre-merger notification guidelines for foreign acquisitions and the 2 ̆ 2 legislative history 2 ̆ 2 of the AML pre-merger notification thresholds, which went through successive drafts and significant amendments between March and August, 2008. Part four addresses international benchmarking, raises unanswered questions and issues, and part five concludes. A variety of international organizations advocate strong national competition policy and use the substance and deployment of national antitrust law to evaluate a jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s economic regulation. With the adoption of the AML, China joined a growing number of states that have adopted comprehensive competition laws, but the test of the AML will be in its application. The challenges facing new enforcement agencies are vast: organizational, establishing enforcement procedures that comport with the existing Chinese legal system, allocating appropriate functions to three entities and coordinating process and substance, and, finally, establishing policies and priorities. Given the choice of where to begin enforcement, an agency should weigh the destructiveness of the restraint, importance and ability to enforce, and its own proficiency or readiness to enforce the particular category of violations. China chose to promulgate its first set of AML Guidelines on the subject of pre-merger notification. In a different system, pre-merger notification and enforcement may not be an obvious first step for a new competition agency implementing a new antitrust law. On the one hand, since the AML itself requires pre-merger notification but does not provide sufficient information to comply, Guidelines are needed. On the other hand, the relevant enforcement agency could have paced its enforcement of mergers. In addition, the enforcement mechanism in China will involve three different government ministries, each responsible for enforcing different segments of the AML. The SAIC, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, will be responsible for enforcing the provisions against abuse of dominant positions, the NDRC, National Development and Reform Commission, will be entrusted with anti-cartel enforcement, and MOFCOM, the Ministry of Commerce, will have jurisdiction over the merger review provisions of the AML. The organizational structure of three entities with separate responsibilities under the AML may complicate the priority-setting process and set up incentives for maximum activity by each as it competes for position. Additionally, given China 2 ̆ 7 s rapid economic growth and pace of mergers, including foreign investments, there may have been a felt need to assert enforcement power in this arena early. MOFCOM has already begun to issue additional draft Guidelines and review proposed mergers. Emerging from a lengthy drafting process, the operative agencies appear to be moving with alacrity. Going forward, clarity, transparency and predictability would be recommended in the refinement of the notification procedures and promulgation of substantive merger standards. The AML is indeterminate and judicial interpretation is unavailable, so a clear articulation of the appropriate methodology and controlling legal standard is an unfinished project. Retrospectively, the experience of the AML and Guideline process has revealed notable receptivity to international commentary on the substance and procedures of merger review. The now-adopted Notification Guidelines went through several public drafts and comments were affirmatively solicited from 2 ̆ 2 all sectors of society 2 ̆ 2 including domestic and foreign scholars and lawyers. Viewing the various official drafts and public comments suggests that some of the recommendations were taken on board. Additionally, the solicitation itself refers to the consensus-based international benchmarks of the ICN and asserts consistency with international standards. The application of the AML, Notification Guidelines and additional Guidelines continues to be a work in progress...|$|R
