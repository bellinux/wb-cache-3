40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} examines a firm’s strategic opportunity to invest in <b>network</b> <b>facility</b> under access pricing based on access costs, and then compares a cooperative investment regime with a noncooperative investment regime. It is shown that access charges higher (lower) than a critical proportion level of access costs induce larger (lower) network expansion under the cooperative investment regime than under the noncooperative one, because of an entry-inducing effect of the access pricing. In addition, the feasibility of the optimum level of investment can be examined under the two investment regimes. Key words: <b>network</b> <b>facility,</b> investment, access charge...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} firms' {{incentive to}} make irreversible investments under an open access policy with stochastically growing demand. Using a simple model, we derive an access-to-bypass equilibrium. Analysis of the equilibrium {{confirms that the}} introduction of competition in network industries makes a firm's incentive to make investments greater than those of a monopolist. We then show that a change in access charges induces a trade-off in social welfare. That is, {{a decrease in the}} access charge expands a social benefit flow in the access duopoly, and deters not only the introduction of a new <b>network</b> <b>facility,</b> but also a positive network externality generated by the construction of an additional bypass network. The feasibility of the socially optimal investment timing is then discussedOpen access policy, Investment, Real options, <b>Network</b> <b>facility,</b> Access charge...|$|R
