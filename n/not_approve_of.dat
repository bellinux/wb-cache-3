5|$|Besides poets, at {{high school}} Lewis met Sophie Carson, who {{eventually}} became his wife. Klein, their mutual friend, introduced them. Carson came from a religious Jewish family. Her father did <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> Lewis, {{because he was a}} recent immigrant to Canada, and in Carson's father's opinion had little to no possibility of success.|$|E
5|$|They wrote frequently, and by March 1920, Scott {{had sent}} Zelda his mother's ring, {{and the two}} had become engaged. Many of Zelda's friends and {{members of her family}} were wary of the relationship, as they did <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> Scott's {{excessive}} drinking, and Zelda's Episcopalian family did not like {{the fact that he was}} a Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Always {{interested}} in military history, Kippenberger joined the local {{unit of the}} New Zealand Cadet Corps and found that he enjoyed soldiering. His father did <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> his interest but regardless, Kippenberger enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in late 1915 {{at the age of}} 18. Because only men between the ages of 19 and 45 were required to register for service, he falsified his age to ensure that he would be eligible for duty overseas.|$|E

60|$|At length, {{much to my}} relief, my {{aunt and}} Mr. Wickfield came back, after a pretty long absence.

5|$|By the mid-1860s a deep rift had {{developed}} between Irataba, who was proactive in cooperating with white settlers, and Homoseh quahote, who passively tolerated but did <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> white encroachment on Mohave lands. Irataba was Aha macave yaltanack of the Mohave from 1861 to 1866, but from 1867 to 1869 opinions differ, and by 1870 US government correspondence suggests that Homoseh quahote had succeeded him {{as leader of}} the Fort Mohave group.|$|E
5|$|Champollion married Rosine Blanc (17941871) in 1818 {{after four}} years of engagement, they had one {{daughter}}, Zoraïde Chéronnet-Champollion (182489). Rosine was the daughter of a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first her father did <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met, but with his increasing reputation he eventually agreed. Originally Jacques-Joseph did <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> his brother's marriage either, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away from his family for months or even years at a time, while traveling to Paris, to Italy, and to Egypt. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an ode to Champollion's work at a celebration in his honor, and the two exchanged letters for a while, but an affair never developed.|$|E
5|$|Dark Magus was {{released}} after Davis' 1975 retirement, upon which his label, Columbia Records, issued several albums of various outtakes. After issuing the live recordings Agharta (1975) and Pangaea (1976), Columbia {{decided that they}} did <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> the albums, and Dark Magus {{was released}} only in Japan, in 1977 by CBS-Sony. The label's A executive Tatsu Nosaki suggested the album's title, which referred to the Magus from the Zoroastrian religion.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} as {{archbishop}} there was a dispute with the monks of Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, who resented Baldwin's attempts to impose stricter control over them and disputed the legitimacy of Baldwin's election.

5|$|Hess {{was obsessed}} with his health {{to the point of}} hypochondria, {{consulting}} many doctors and other practitioners for what he described to his captors in Britain as a long list of ailments involving the kidneys, colon, gall bladder, bowels and heart. Like Hitler, Hess was a vegetarian, and he did not smoke or drink. He brought his own food to the Berghof, claiming it was biologically dynamic, but Hitler did <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> this practice, so he discontinued taking meals with the Führer.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was inexperienced in relationships, but {{the well-to-do}} widow {{encouraged}} him and provided for {{him with her}} substantial savings. The two were married on 9 July 1735, at St. Werburgh's Church in Derby. The Porter family did <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> the match, partly because Johnson was 25 and Elizabeth was 21 years his elder. His mother's marriage to Johnson so disgusted her son Jervis that he stopped talking to her. Her other son Joseph later accepted the marriage, and her daughter, Lucy, accepted Johnson from the start.|$|E

5|$|President James Monroe and Congress invited Lafayette {{to visit}} the United States in 1824, in part to {{celebrate}} the nation's upcoming 50thanniversary. Monroe intended to have Lafayette travel on an American warship, but the general felt having such a vessel as transport was undemocratic, and booked passage on a merchantman.

He had {{originally}} asked to wear the number when he first joined the Canucks, but was not permitted to do so by head coach Pat Quinn, who did <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> high jersey numbers. After the Canucks traded with the Buffalo Sabres for Alexander Mogilny, reuniting the two Russian players, the jersey number was deemed acceptable because Mogilny had used number 89 since defecting to North America in 1989.|$|E

Sullivan was a frequent visitor at the Scott Russell home in the mid-1860s, and by 1865 the affair was in full bloom. Rachel's parents did <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> a possible union with a young composer with uncertain financial prospects, but the two continued to see each other covertly. At some point in 1868, Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with Rachel's sister Louise (1841–1878). Both relationships had ceased by early 1869.|$|E

Her father did <b>not</b> <b>approve</b> <b>of</b> the match; in his view Prince Louis had little money and would deprive him of his daughter's company, as the couple would naturally live abroad in Britain. However, Victoria was of an independent mind and took little notice of her father's displeasure. Remarkably, that same evening, Victoria's father secretly married his mistress, Countess Alexandrine Hutten-Czapska, the former wife of Alexander von Kolemine, the Russian chargé d'affaires in Darmstadt. His marriage to a divorcee who was not of equal rank shocked the assembled royalty of Europe and through diplomatic and family pressure Victoria's father was forced to seek an annulment of his own marriage.|$|E
5|$|Several episcopalians, {{supporters}} of the existing system of bishops, were {{also included in the}} summoning ordinance, but Parliament may have nominated them to lend greater legitimacy to the Assembly and not have expected them to attend because Charles had <b>not</b> <b>approved</b> <b>of</b> the Assembly.
