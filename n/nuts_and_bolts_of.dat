Also the fame of the show skyrocketed during the season The A.V. Club called the show a [...] "pokemon" [...] and [...] "one of the best TV shows around, burning through plot points at a furious clip, swooning romanticism, at embracing the kind of deeply earnest, intensely felt romance that made the show’s relationships so great. Meredith’s famous [...] "Pick me, choose me, love me" [...] speech is corny, to be sure, but it’s got tremendous rhythm and absolute conviction...season two of Grey’s was a comet." [...] Todd Gilchrist of IGN Entertainment expressed hope in the further development of the series, noting the complex backgrounds of each character as being the series' focal point. He noted that the ensemble, composed of [...] "countless comely females and enough strong, competitive males" [...] remains outstanding in prime time, being iconic, due to the vast interpretations regarding the main cast. Whereas Gilchrist acknowledged that the show gives the impression of it being only for women, he stated that he can attest to its universal, equal-opportunity appeal, assessing that the show [...] "explores the medical world with both a sense of testosterone-fueled intensity and estrogen-laced sensitivity" [...] and deserved to have viewers from both genders, championing its merits. In response to the bomb story arc, he called the two episodes [...] "juicy", while assessing that they [...] "followed a story line that not only explained the series up to that point, but featured all of the characters in their more or less purest from". Gilchrist provided an outlook on each character, describing Grey as a [...] "prodigiously talented but insecure surgeon, waylaid by her love for attending Derek Shepherd", while stating that Yang, [...] "an aggressively ambitious intern" [...] lacks knowledge on any topic, except medicine, comparing her to boyfriend Burke, described as her opposite. In response to George O'Malley's story line, he noted how his sensitive personality constantly results in difficulty in his path to becoming a proper surgeon. He also expressed excitement in the doors opened by the previous season's cliffhanger, seeing the arrival of Montgomery (Walsh) as [...] "certainly speaking to the show's focus on relationships over the <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> being a surgeon", while praising Rhimes for continuing to [...] "merge those disparate elements in the way that does, or at least should be a source of enthusiasm for both men and women, creating an atmosphere both professional and intimately personal, often at the same time".|$|E

2500|$|AllMusic {{reviewer}} William Ruhlmann {{opened his}} review by mentioning how the group released several {{songs in the}} preceding 18 months. Calling this decision [...] "indicative of Man Overboard's youthful drive; this is a band that is in a hurry". This [...] "rush" [...] was [...] "expressed in the breakneck tempos of the short (none over {{three and a half}} minutes) songs" [...] on the group's self-titled album. Ruhlmann classified the album's sound as being [...] "standard-issue" [...] pop punk in the vein of Green Day and Blink-182, with [...] "an echo" [...] of Jimmy Eat World, in terms of the Bruzzese and Eisensteins' [...] "contrasting vocals". Writing for Rock Sound, Andy Ritchie noted that the album [...] "reveals little reinvention, but the <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> what makes them so affable have only been tightened and polished further". He considered the band had [...] "a formula that just works," [...] concluding [...] "there really isn’t a dud track here".|$|E
2500|$|As Raimi and his {{producing}} partner Robert Tapert progressed {{through various}} drafts, {{they realized that}} there was a potential franchise on their hands. Universal brought in screenwriting brothers Daniel and Joshua Goldin to work on the script. According to Daniel, they were presented with various drafts and [...] "lots of little story documents. There was just material everywhere; drafts seemed to go in many directions." [...] Goldin said that they [...] "spent {{a lot of time talking}} and pulling together a way of making the story work. I think that mostly we talked in terms of the <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> the story." [...] The Goldins added new lines of dialogue, new characters and bits of action. The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script. For Raimi, he wanted to emphasize Peyton/Darkman's arc over the course of the film. He said, [...] "I decided to explore a man's soul. In the beginning, a sympathetic, sincere man. In the middle, a vengeful man committing heinous acts against his enemies. And in the end, a man full of self-hatred for what he's become, who must drift off into the night, into a world apart from everyone he knows and all the things he loves." ...|$|E

40|$|Based on Intel’s Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture, Intel Xeon Phi {{is one of}} the few truly many-core CPUs- fea-turing around 60 fairly {{powerful}} cores, {{two levels}} of caches, and graphic memory, all interconnected by a very fast ring. Given its promised ease-of-use and high performance, we took Xeon Phi out for a test drive. In this paper, we present this experience at two different levels: (1) the microbench-mark level, where we stress ”each <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> ” <b>of</b> Phi in the lab, and (2) the application level, where we study Phi’s performance response in a real-life environment. At the mi-crobenchmarking level, we show the high performance of five components of the architecture, focusing on their maximum achieved performance and the prerequisites to achieve it. Next, we choose a medical imaging application (Leukocyte Tracking) as a case study. We observed that it is rather easy to get functional code and start benchmarking, but the first performance numbers can be far from satisfying. Our experience indicates that a simple data structure and mas-sive parallelism are critical for Xeon Phi to perform well. When compiler-driven parallelization and/or vectorization fails, programming Xeon Phi for performance can become very challenging...|$|R
40|$|I want {{to argue}} that the {{juncture}} between urban and rural is the basis of modernity in the metropolis. The complex dynamic between landscape and nature associated with pre-industrial societies, and rational planning as an indicator of capitalistic urban environments, comes to the fore in London during the opening decades of the nineteenth century. This is evident in the mixture of public and private enterprise and metropolis at this time. My focus here is on the confluence and antipathy between architecture and landscape; tradition and modernity in London. I am particularly interested in how the <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> issues <b>of</b> estate development were in fact a blue print for the modern city in the latter’s concern with issues such as hygiene, public open spaces and rational plans. My intention is to show that the beginnings of modernity so readily attributed to cities such as Paris and Berlin and theorised in the texts of thinkers such as Ebenezer Howard and Camillo Sitte, can in fact also be found in London in the early nineteenth century. Moreover, London was an important example for the rest of Europe – not least Paris...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{concept to}} {{generate}} miniature shockwaves in a safe, repeatable, and controllable manner in laboratory confinements using an in situ oxyhydrogen generator {{has been proposed}} and demonstrated. This method proves to be more advantageous than existing methods because there is flexibility to vary strength of the shockwave, {{there is no need}} for storage of high pressure gases, and there is minimal waste disposal. The required amount of oxyhydrogen mixture is generated using alkaline electrolysis that produces hydrogen and oxygen gases in stoichiometric quantity. The rate of oxyhydrogen mixture production for the newly designed oxyhydrogen generator is found to be around 8 ml/s experimentally. The oxyhydrogen generator is connected to the driver section of a specially designed 10 mm square miniature shock tube assembly. A numerical code that uses CANTERA software package is used to predict the properties of the driver gas in the miniature shock tube. This prediction along with the 1 -D shock tube theory is used to calculate the properties of the generated shockwave and matches reasonably well with the experimentally obtained values for oxyhydrogen mixture fill pressures less than 2. 5 bars. The miniature shock tube employs a modified tri-clover clamp assembly to facilitate quick changing of diaphragm and replaces the more cumbersome <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolt</b> system <b>of</b> fastening components. The versatile nature of oxyhydrogen detonation-driven miniature shock tube opens up new horizons for shockwave-assisted interdisciplinary applications. Published by AIP Publishing...|$|R
40|$|Regional trade {{agreements}} (RTAs) {{have become an}} indelible feature of the international trading landscape. Most, if not all, RTAs contain provisions that establish procedures for resolving disputes among their signatory members. Yet, the design and functioning of these dispute settlement mechanisms (DSMs) and, more specifically, how they differ from the WTO dispute settlement system remain relatively unexplored. Existing academic literature has primarily focused on the narrow issue of jurisdictional conflict between DSMs of RTAs and the WTO dispute settlement system. Literature mapping out and classifying systematically the DSMs of RTAs is more limited. This research paper goes beyond considering the issue of jurisdictional conflict between the multilateral and regional regimes. We map out the DSMs in RTAs that have been notified to the WTO and were in force {{at the end of}} 2012, and consider a typology of these DSMs based on their nature and design. We also use the data obtained from our mapping exercise in two ways. First, we identify trends and patterns of use, either regionally or by individual countries, of the different types of DSMs in RTAs. Trends are analysed in relation to five key factors: (i) evolution over time, (ii) level of economic development, (iii) regional characteristics, (iv) level of integration (partial scope agreement, free trade agreement or customs union), and (v) configuration (bilateral or plurilateral). Second, we undertake a <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>bolts</b> analysis <b>of</b> the DSMs of RTAs by examining their approach to various issues in international dispute settlement. Our aim is to draw conclusions {{about the extent to which}} the predominant type of DSM in RTAs has features that are different from those of the WTO dispute settlement system...|$|R
