50|$|Whatever {{method of}} {{securing}} attendance is adopted, {{there is an}} obligation to inform a probation officer of the fact <b>of</b> <b>notice,</b> <b>summons</b> or arrest, {{as the case may}} be, as soon as possible, but within a maximum period of 24 hours.|$|R
50|$|What {{is meant}} by {{the title of this}} work is by no means clear. Haubold (de Edictis Monitoriis ac Brevibus, Leipzig, 1804) thinks that monitory edicts are not special writs <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> or <b>summons</b> {{directed}} to the parties {{in the course of a}} cause, but those general clauses of the edictum perpetuum which relate to the law of procedure, giving actions and other remedies on certain conditions, and therefore, tacitly at least, containing warnings as to the consequences of irregularity or nonfulfilment of the prescribed conditions. The fragments of Callistratus certainly afford much support to this view. Haubold distinguishes the edictum monitorium from the edictum breve, upon which Paulus wrote a treatise. The latter he supposes to consist of those new clauses, which, in process of time, were added as an appendage to the edictum perpetuum, after the main body of it had acquired a constant form.|$|R
5000|$|The {{case was}} a review of a {{decision}} by the Master to reject an objection to the liquidator's account. Proceedings were initiated by way <b>of</b> combined <b>summons.</b> The application was to set aside the combined summons as an irregular proceeding {{on the grounds that the}} provisions of Rule 53 of Uniform Rules of Court (providing that proceedings on review [...] "shall be by way <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> motion") and of section 407(4)(a) of the Companies Act (providing that a person aggrieved by the Master's direction may [...] "apply to Court") required that proceedings be brought by way <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> motion. The court dismissed application on the grounds that neither Rule 53 nor section 407(4)(a) rendered proceedings by way <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> motion peremptory.|$|R

50|$|The {{exception}} is taken by way <b>of</b> a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> motion without an affidavit. It sets out {{the basis of}} the exception, as exactly which aspect <b>of</b> the <b>summons</b> that the {{exception is}} levelled against as well as the grounds for the exception. Where the exception is taken {{on the grounds that the}} summons is vague and embarrassing, the defendant is required to state that he has given the plaintiff a chance to rectify the cause of complaint. A prayer appears at the end <b>of</b> the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> exception in which the defendant requests the court to uphold the exception and dismiss the claim.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first issue}} {{referred}} to the committee related to the effect <b>of</b> writs <b>of</b> <b>summons.</b> Writs <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> are issued to peers upon the <b>summoning</b> <b>of</b> each new Parliament. The central question was whether writs <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> have a continuing effect throughout Parliament, or whether their effect was [...] "spent" [...] once a peer entered Parliament and handed it in to the Clerk. The portions of the Bill relevant to the issue were: [...] "No-one shall {{be a member of}} the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage ... Accordingly, any writ <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> issued for the present Parliament in right of a hereditary peerage shall not have effect after present Session." ...|$|R
