With Soulcalibur IV, Ivy's look on the promotional artwork was modified on the English website to hide her undercleavage, leading to suspicion of censorship in the American release of the game. When asked about the censoring, director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated he had heard of <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> having taken place. When released in North America it was shown that no actual censorship had occurred within the game.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal to stand up for himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, but being on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that they keep their relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E

Pessoa was not fully convinced by this argument, and drew up an unofficial memorandum of the Portuguese case for Honda Masazumi, Ieyasu's handler of foreign affairs, much to the displeasure of Hasegawa and Murayama, who wrongly suspected that Pessoa had also complained about the two in the memorandum. In any case, Honda, with authorization from Ieyasu, gave Pessoa's envoy written assurances that Japanese sailors would be forbidden to travel to Macau, and any who did could be handled according to Portuguese laws.|$|E

In 1841 edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Andrew Jackson Downing described the area this way: <b>The</b> whole <b>of</b> this neighborhood of Brookline {{is a kind of}} landscape garden, and there is <b>nothing</b> in America <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort,</b> so inexpressibly charming as the lanes which lead from one cottage, or villa, to another. No animals are allowed to run at large, and the open gates, with tempting vistas and glimpses under the pendent boughs, give it quite an Arcadian air of rural freedom and enjoyment. These lanes are clothed with a profusion of trees and wild shrubbery, often almost to the carriage tracks, and curve and wind about, in a manner quite bewildering to the stranger who attempts to thread them alone; and there are more hints here for <b>the</b> lover <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picturesque in lanes than we ever saw assembled together in so small a compass.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> facts <b>of</b> {{physical}} suffering, of incurable pain, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chance grimly narrowed, {{had been}} made, at a stroke, intense, {{and this was}} to be the way he was now to feel them. <b>The</b> clearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air, in short, making vision not only possible but inevitable, the one thing left to be thankful for was <b>the</b> breadth <b>of</b> Sir Luke's shoulders, which, should one be able to keep in line with them, might in some degree interpose. It was, however, far from plain to Densher for the first day or two that he was again to see his distinguished friend at all. That he couldn't, on any basis actually serving, return to the palace--this was as solid to him, every whit, as <b>the</b> other feature <b>of</b> his case, <b>the</b> fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> publicity attaching to his proscription through his not having taken himself off. He had been seen often enough in the Leporelli gondola. As, accordingly, he was not on any presumption destined to meet Sir Luke about the town, where the latter would have neither time nor taste to lounge, nothing more would occur between them unless the great man should surprisingly wait upon him. His doing that, Densher further reflected, wouldn't even simply depend on Mrs. Stringham's having decided to--as they might say--turn him on. It would depend as well--for there would be practically some difference to her--on her actually attempting it; and it would depend above all on what Sir Luke would make of such an overture. Densher had for that matter his own view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amount, to say <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particular <b>sort,</b> <b>of</b> response it might expect from him. He had his own view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> such a personage even to understand such an appeal. To what extent could he be prepared, and what importance in fine could he attach? Densher asked himself these questions, in truth, to put his own position at the worst. He should miss the great man completely unless the great man should come to see him, and the great man could only come to see him for a purpose unsupposable. Therefore he wouldn't come at all, and consequently there was nothing to hope.|$|R

Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient to fulfill eligibility requirements for a PhD, and urged him to offer the Tractatus as his thesis.

2500|$|While Hart {{considered}} {{an offer from}} then-WCW President Eric Bischoff, McMahon informed Hart that the WWF would honor his contract if he chose to stay. However, when Hart talked to McMahon about future plans and storylines, he was disappointed by McMahon's response and what he considered lackluster suggestions. As seen in the documentary, , Hart acknowledged around this time that his career had been sabotaged by nationalist changes to his character. Throughout 1997, [...] "The Hitman" [...] regularly criticized America and deemed it inferior to Canada, drawing the ire of American audiences and yet winning him the respect of WWF's sizable Canadian fan-base; this rendered Hart neither a definite hero nor a villain and left him unable to properly enter into feuds with other wrestlers. Hart had also been unhappy about McMahon's move towards more controversial subject matter, which the World Wrestling Federation would later call [...] "The Attitude Era". Convinced that McMahon's future plans did not include him, Hart resigned from the WWF. He {{signed an agreement with}} WCW, which had just offered him a large $3 million per annum contract on November 1, 1997. McMahon was worried about the possibility of him entering WCW as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Hart asked McMahon if he would be mocked after leaving for WCW, as had occurred with other wrestlers who had transferred to WCW from the WWF; for example, in the previous year the WWF had made fun of Hulk Hogan and [...] "Macho Man" [...] Randy Savage in vignettes referring to them as [...] "The Huckster" [...] and [...] "The Nacho Man", in addition to having Glenn Jacobs and Rick Bognar portray [...] "Diesel" [...] and [...] "Razor Ramon", characters that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall had made famous before their 1996 departure from the WWF.

2500|$|Despite {{the popular}} demand to [...] "avenge Gordon", the Conservative {{government}} {{that came into}} office after the 1885 election did <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort.</b> The Sudan was judged to be not worth the huge financial costs {{it would have taken}} to conquer it, the same conclusion that the Liberals had reached. After Khartoum, the Mahdi established his Islamic state which restored slavery and imposed a very harsh rule that according to one estimate caused the deaths of 8 million people between 1885‚Äì1898. In 1887, the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition under Henry Morton Stanley sent out to rescue Dr. Emin Pasha, still holding out in Equatoria against the Ansar. Many have seen the attempt to save Emin Pasha, a German doctor-biologist-botanist who had converted from Judaism first to Lutheranism and then (possibly) to Islam, and who had not been particularly famous in Europe until then, as a consolation prize for Gordon. Egypt had been in the French sphere of influence until 1882 when the British had occupied it. In March 1896 a French force under the command of Jean-Baptiste Marchand left Dakar with the intention of marching across the Sahara with the aim of destroying the Mahdiyah state. The French hoped that conquering the Sudan would allow them to lever the British out of Egypt, and thus restore Egypt to the French sphere of influence. To block the French, a British force under Herbert Kitchener was sent to destroy the Mahdiyah state and annihilated the Ansar at the Battle of Omdurman in 1898. It was thus imperial rivalry with the French, not a desire to [...] "avenge Gordon" [...] that led the British to end the Mahdiyah state in 1898. However the British public and Kitchener himself saw the expedition as one to [...] "avenge Gordon". As the Mahdi was long dead, Kitchener had to content himself with blowing up the Mahdi's tomb as revenge for Gordon. After the Battle of Omdurman, Kitchener opened a letter from the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, {{and for the first time}} learned the real purpose of the expedition to keep the French out of the Sudan and that [...] "avenging Gordon" [...] was merely a pretext.|$|E
