5|$|Number two, why {{was this}} person, {{this one of the}} six around to commit this hideous crime? He was out because he had a 31-count {{indictment}} for the rape of a child, and he was out on $15,000 bail, instead of the requisite $450,000 bail that he never could have made and <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have been on the street.|$|E
5|$|According to Nathan Fillion, {{there was}} an episode in which the crew land on a dying planet. The {{inhabitants}} try to steal Serenity, after they explain to the crew about their need {{to get off the}} planet. The problem is that unless they were to run into another ship along the way, with the extra passengers, Serenity would not have enough fuel and oxygen {{to make it to the}} closest destination. While everyone else is asleep, Mal takes the ship himself and discovers that help <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have arrived.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has {{everyone}} stay late {{to cover}} for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's (Ameenah Kaplan) boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), arrives and accuses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) of {{having an affair with}} her, after having read Darryl's text messages to her. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, she <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E

60|$|Wessex {{had seemed}} {{relieved}} when the Queen entered, and Ursula knew that <b>never</b> again <b>would</b> she {{be allowed to}} see him alone, <b>never</b> again <b>would</b> she {{be able to speak}} to him undisturbed.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly an idea {{popped into}} Prissy's head. Dared she? Oh, she never could! But he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> know--there <b>would</b> {{be plenty of}} time--she would! ...|$|R
25|$|In the 2003 movie American Splendor, Crumb {{was portrayed}} by James Urbaniak. Crumb's wife Aline {{was quoted as}} saying she hated the {{interpretation}} and <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have married Robert if he was like that.|$|E
25|$|Benny and Sarnoff {{eventually}} met {{several years}} later and became good friends. Benny later observed that if he'd {{had this kind of}} relationship with Sarnoff earlier, when he was Sarnoff's number-one radio star, he <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have left NBC.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} after the latest setback, the gelding {{did it at}} Eskilstuna by claiming the easiest victory of his career, according to trainer/driver Johansson. Johansson admitted that Victory Tilly probably <b>never</b> <b>would</b> return to his past heights because of the injuries and age.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no, impossible,' said Geraldine, 'it <b>would</b> <b>never</b> do; it <b>would</b> only spoil everybody's pleasure, and be {{too much}} for me.' ...|$|R
60|$|That {{story was}} over--just as Hugh's story was over. That first volume <b>would</b> <b>never</b> {{now have a}} second and a third. It ended in some hasty grave in Russia. The great scheme for {{marginal}} indices <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be patented, the duets with the pianola <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be played again.|$|R
50|$|The project <b>would</b> <b>never</b> break even; toll income <b>would</b> <b>never</b> amortise {{the initial}} investment, and the {{contractor}} {{would have to}} be supported by subsidies.|$|R
25|$|The Hollywood Foreign Press Association awarded Ball a Golden Globe {{nomination}} (Arthur {{received one}} as well) but, disheartened by its reception, she swore she <b>never</b> <b>would</b> {{appear on the}} big screen again, and the film proved to be her last theatrical film (not counting Stone Pillow, her 1985 made-for-TV film).|$|E
25|$|Only {{weeks after}} his novella was first {{published}} in April 1943, despite his wife's pleadings and before Saint-Exupéry had received any of its royalties (he <b>never</b> <b>would),</b> the author-aviator joined the Free French Forces. He would remain immensely proud of The Little Prince, and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.|$|E
25|$|In August 2016, Rogen again {{spoke to}} Howard Stern {{about how he}} had felt hurt and {{somewhat}} betrayed back then by Heigl's comments. He went on {{to talk about what}} a great rapport they'd had on set while working together, and that at the time he had even envisioned making many more movies with her. Though Rogen wishes she would have apologized to him personally as opposed to publicly, he affirmed that he still really liked her, and that he <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have wanted the incident to hurt her career.|$|E
60|$|Ladrone whinnied piteously for his mates as I led him {{aboard the}} steamer, {{but they did}} not answer. They were patiently waiting their master's signal. <b>Never</b> again <b>would</b> they set eyes on the stately gray leader who was bound to most adventurous things. <b>Never</b> again <b>would</b> they see the green grass come on the hills.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he interrupted; [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> {{have let}} you know I loved you. I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have asked you this--Norah, will you be my wife?" ...|$|R
60|$|Having once acceded to {{the truth}} of Lady Fawn's views, she {{abandoned}} all hope. Everybody said so, and it was so. There was no word from any side to encourage her. The thing was done and over, and she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> mention his name again. She would simply beg of all the Fawns that no allusion might be made to him in her presence. She <b>would</b> <b>never</b> blame him, and certainly she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> praise him. As far as she could rule her tongue, she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have his name upon her lips again.|$|R
25|$|Bill Cotton, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid–1970s, {{said after}} the first series was {{produced}} that the show was {{a prime example of}} the BBC's relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them, but, trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have let the programme get to the production stage {{on the basis of the}} scripts.|$|E
25|$|The second volume, I Am Spock (1995), saw Nimoy {{communicating}} that {{he finally}} realized {{his years of}} portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely, Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things {{in a way that}} he <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have thought if he had not portrayed the character. As such, in this autobiography Nimoy maintains that in some meaningful sense he has merged with Spock {{while at the same time}} maintaining the distance between fact and fiction.|$|E
25|$|After the remarriage, Auchincloss' Merrywood {{estate in}} McLean, Virginia became the Bouvier sisters' primary residence, {{although}} they also spent time at his other estate, Hammersmith Farm in Newport, Rhode Island, {{and in their}} father's homes in New York City and Long Island. Although she retained a relationship with her father, Bouvier also regarded her stepfather as a close paternal figure. He gave her a stable environment and the pampered childhood she <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have experienced otherwise. While Bouvier adjusted to her mother's remarriage, she sometimes felt like an outsider in the WASP social circle of the Auchinclosses, attributing the feeling to her being Catholic {{as well as being}} a child of divorce, which was not common in that social group at that time.|$|E

40|$|Over{{diagnosis}} is {{the diagnosis}} of deviations, abnormalities, risk factors, and pathologies that in themselves <b>would</b> <b>never</b> cause symptoms (this applies only to risk factors and pathology), <b>would</b> <b>never</b> lead to morbidity, and <b>would</b> <b>never</b> {{be the cause of}} death. Therefore, treating an overdiagnosed condition (deviation, abnormality, risk factor, pathology) cannot, by definition, improve the patient’s prognosis, and can therefore only be harmful...|$|R
50|$|Svafrlami was {{the king}} of Gardariki, and Odin's grandson. He managed to trap the dwarves Dvalinn and Durin when they had left the rock where they dwelt. Then he forced them to forge a sword with a golden hilt that <b>would</b> <b>never</b> miss a stroke, <b>would</b> <b>never</b> rust and <b>would</b> cut through stone and iron as easily as through clothes.|$|R
25|$|Matthew Cowley {{dedicated}} a meetinghouse and a {{new mission}} home in Papeete just four years later on January 22, 1950. Later that same year, the church purchased a two-masted schooner {{that was used to}} aid in transporting missionaries and members from the various islands in French Polynesia. The boat was called Paraita which was the Tahitian name for Addison Pratt. The schooner was scheduled to take a group of members to Hawaii to visit the temple. President McKay instructed the members to cancel the trip in 1959. The boat sank a few days later and <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have made the trip. In 1963, the church experienced a tragedy when a boat that was transporting members back to Maupiti crashed. 15 church members were killed.|$|E
25|$|In a {{surprise}} move, the lame duck zoning commission reversed course in late November 1974 and approved the proposed revised zoning {{rules for the}} Georgetown waterfront. The Washington Post reported that the rezoning process would have to begin again under the home-rule zoning commission, and there was little chance that the new commission {{would be able to}} approve anything like the proposed regulations. The existing zoning commission acted, the newspaper suggested, because it would suffer no political retaliation (having gone out of business), its actions could give the home-rule zoning commission political cover to retain the rules, and because its members believed there had been enough delay and consideration of the rules. Development, the old commission felt, had to proceed now or it <b>never</b> <b>would.</b> The GCA immediately sued to have the new zoning regulations overturned, and the D.C. Superior Court blocked all development in the area while the suit was pending.|$|E
25|$|Aurelian's short reign reunited a {{fragmented}} Empire while saving Rome from barbarian invasions that had reached Italy itself. His death prevented a full restoration of political stability and a lasting dynasty that could end {{the cycle of}} assassination of emperors and civil war that marked this period. Even so, he brought the Empire through a very critical period in its history, and without Aurelian it <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have survived the invasions and fragmentation of the decade in which he reigned. Much hard fighting remained for his successors before the Empire finally regained the initiative against the Persians and the northern barbarian peoples, {{and it would be}} another twenty years or more before Diocletian fully restored stability and ended the Crisis of the third century. However, after that the Western half of the Empire would survive another two hundred years, while the East would last another millennium, and for that Aurelian must be allowed much of the credit.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, how dare Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, <b>never</b> <b>would</b> he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E
25|$|Zach {{comes into}} the {{knowledge}} that Kendall agreed to act as the surrogate for Ryan and Greenlee's baby when Greenlee's chances of giving birth became non-existent. He utterly hates the idea, and is determined to ensure Kendall will not go through with it. Once Ryan reveals himself to be alive a little after this, Kendall comes to the shocking realization that her husband helped Ryan fake his death. She is enraged at Zach, and states that she <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have taken {{on the task of}} being Greenlee's surrogate if she had known that Ryan is alive. Zach and Kendall fight on and off, but no matter their argumentative nature, Zach has developed true romantic feelings for Kendall. At this point, Greenlee has discovered that Kendall is pregnant not with Greenlee and Ryan's baby, but rather with Kendall and Ryan's baby. She spills this knowledge to the whole town, stating that Kendall has betrayed her in order to produce a child between Ryan and herself. Kendall is embarrassed and heartbroken at Greenlee's accusation, and tries to explain that Greenlee's eggs had been destroyed at implantation time, and if she had not used her own eggs, Greenlee would have been without Ryan's child for certain. Greenlee does not care to listen and soon leaves town. Zach sticks by Kendall's side and tells her of his love for her. Kendall is afraid of his declaration, and starts to distance herself from him. She asks for a divorce, not admitting that she feels the same way. Zach agrees to grant her a divorce, but Bianca Montgomery, Kendall's sister, counsels Zach to not give up on Kendall. Zach does as suggested, and informs Kendall of his love for her again. This time Kendall does not hold back and the two share a passionate kiss.|$|E

60|$|And {{while he}} slumbered and {{breathed in the}} perfume of the wondrous Valley the Spirit of Happiness crept into his heart and drove out all terror and care and misgivings. <b>Never</b> more <b>would</b> the face of Claus be clouded with anxieties; <b>never</b> more <b>would</b> the trials of life weigh him down as with a burden. The Laughing Valley had claimed him for its own.|$|R
60|$|When he {{returned}} the next morning there was no change in him. Days passed--weeks, months, even elapsed, and still, though his manner insensibly became {{what it used to}} be toward his other children, it never altered toward his eldest son. At the rare periods when they now met, except when absolutely obliged to speak, he preserved total silence in his intercourse with Gabriel. He <b>would</b> <b>never</b> take Gabriel out with him in the boat; he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> sit alone with Gabriel in the house; he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> eat a meal with Gabriel; he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> let the other children talk to him about Gabriel; and he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> hear a word in expostulation, a word in reference to anything his dead father had said or done on the night of the storm, from Gabriel himself.|$|R
