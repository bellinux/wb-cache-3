40|$|A {{method of}} {{synoptic}} map assimilation {{has been developed}} to study global rearrangements of open magnetic flux and formation of polar coronal holes (PCHs) in the current cycle. The analysis reveals ensembles of coronal holes (ECHs) which appear within unipolar magnetic regions associated with decaying activity complexes (ACs). The cause-effect relations between them explain asynchronous PCH formation observed at {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres of the Sun. Thus, the decay of large ACs, that were observed in 2014, led to formation of an extensive ECH, which then became the south PCH in mid- 2015. Intricate structure of magnetic fields in the <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>zone</b> has impeded the north PCH formation, {{despite the fact that the}} dominant polarity at the North Pole reversed two years earlier than at the South Pole. The north PCH formed only by mid- 2016 as the result of gradual merger of high-latitudinal ECHs associated with several decaying ACs.

40|$|Vector crustal {{magnetic}} field {{maps of the}} <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> <b>zone</b> (60 °N to 90 °N) are constructed from selected Mars Global Surveyor magnetometer data obtained {{during the period from}} May 28 to September 13, 1998. Two medium anomalies (amplitudes > 50 nT at 170 km altitude) are mapped in locations consistent with earlier studies. No visible surface features correlate with the anomalies, suggesting that the sources lie beneath the visible veneer of polar deposits and volcanic lava flows. If so, then they formed prior to the immediate end of the heavy bombardment (upper Hesperian) period. Modeling of anomaly vector field components combined with independent constraints on the depth to the Curie isotherm yields lower limits on bulk magnetization intensities (0. 4 – 0. 9 A/m) that are significantly greater than those measured for Martian (SNC) meteorite samples. Rocks that contain substantially more titanomagnetite than SNC meteorites, or that contain magnetic phases in addition to titanomagnetite, possibly resulting from hydrothermal alteration, are therefore suggested. Alternatively, remanence acquisition in a field of Earthlike intensity (∼ 50 μT), rather than in the relatively weak inferred paleointensities for SNC meteorites (∼ 1 – 10 μT), would also help to explain the relatively strong inferred remanent magnetizations. The approximate south paleomagnetic pole positions corresponding to these two anomaly sources are located in a region between Olympus Mons and the present north rotational pole. This region is adjacent to the approximate location predicted by Melosh [1980] for the paleopole prior to the formation of the Tharsis gravity anomaly...|$|E
40|$|The {{chlorophyll}} a (chl a) biomass {{and primary}} production of three phytoplankton size fractions were estimated in the Atlantic {{sector of the}} Southern Ocean from 12 December 1995 to 20 January 1996. Elevated concentrations of chl a, primary production, and contribution of microplankton (> 20 ?m) coincided with dominance by large or long-chained diatoms (Thalassiothrix spp., Pseudonitzschia lineola, and Chaetoceros spp.) in the <b>Polar</b> Frontal <b>Zone</b> (PFZ, 49. 5 °S– 52 °S). Vertically resolved assimilation numbers (i. e. primary production normalized to chl a) and intrinsic growth rates of microplankton were much lower at high-biomass stations of the <b>Northern</b> <b>Polar</b> Frontal <b>Zone</b> (NPFZ) than in adjacent waters. Silicic acid {{appeared to be the}} proximal factor limiting the growth and yield of resident diatoms in the NPFZ. A carbon budget showed that, during the sampling period, diatom dominance at high-biomass sites was associated with near-steady-state conditions. This system exhibited a low POC sinking flux relative to total primary production, despite strong dominance by microplankton. South of 52 °S, total chl a and primary production were generally low, but increased sharply in a mixed Phaeocystis-diatom bloom that extended from 61 °S to 65 °S in the Seasonal Ice Zone (SIZ). We estimated that the PFZ contributes from 37 % to 67 % of the total open-water new production in the Southern Ocean near the Greenwich meridian, depending on whether blooms occur or not in the SIZ. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The MinE protein {{functions}} as a topological specificity factor in determining the site of septal placement in Escherichia coli. MinE assembles into a membrane-associated ring structure near midcell and directs the localization of MinD and MinC into a membrane- associated <b>polar</b> <b>zone</b> that undergoes a characteristic pole-to-pole oscillation cycle. Single (green fluorescent protein) and double label (yellow fluorescent protein/cyan fluorescent protein) fluorescence labeling experiments showed that mutational alteration of a site on the alpha-face of MinE led to a failure to assemble the MinE ring, associated with loss {{of the ability to}} support a normal pattern of division site placement. The absence of the MinE ring did not prevent the assembly and disassembly of the MinD <b>polar</b> <b>zone.</b> Mutant cells lacking the MinE ring were characterized by the growth of MinD <b>polar</b> <b>zones</b> past their normal arrest point near midcell. The results suggested that the MinE ring acts as a stop-growth mechanism to prevent the MinCD <b>polar</b> <b>zone</b> from extending beyond the midcell division site...|$|R

Oceanic exchange shows relatively little interannual variability, except in the tropics where a weak sink, up to − 0. 6 PgC yr− 1 during El Nin˜o events in 1983, 1987, and 1998, alternated with a source, as great as 1. 7 PgC yr− 1.

For three broader zones, divided at 30 ° N and S, average fluxes that we deduce from 1980 - 1989 and 1990 - 1996 agree within about 1 PgC yr− 1 with decadal averages of 7 other inversion studies, except in the tropics where we find a larger source of CO 2 than most other studies in the 1980 ’s and all other studies from 1990 - 1996.

40|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> {{stratosphere}} {{plays an}} important role in modulating the wintertime near-surface temperature conditions in midlatitudes. Forecasting <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> stratospheric variability will have the potential to extend the winter weather forecasts in midlatitudes. As such, this research seeks to explore a novel approach of forecasting short-term <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> stratospheric variability using a hierarchy of linear and non-linear statistical models. In addition to El Niño Southern Oscillation, the Quasi-biennial Oscillation, and the 11 -year solar cycle indices, this research uses the upward flux of wave activity from the troposphere into the stratosphere as a predictor for modeling and forecasting <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> stratospheric temperature and geopotential height anomalies. The upward flux of wave activity entering the stratosphere is the primary source of intraseasonal variability in the wintertime stratospheric polar vortex. Multiple linear regression and machine learning models were trained over the 1980 - 2005 time period, and the 10 -day and 20 -day <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> stratospheric temperature and geopotential height forecasts were generated over the 2005 - 2011 time period. The importance of each predictor for modeling <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> stratospheric variability was assessed using a permutation-based method. The study has found that the use of the meridional wave heat flux predictors improves the accuracy of short-term <b>northern</b> <b>polar</b> stratospheric geopotential height forecasts as demonstrated by the correlation coefficient of 0. 48 over the 2005 - 2011 time period. In contrast to previous studies, multiple linear regression shows better predictive performance than the machine learning models over the 2005 - 2011 time period. A better predictive performance of multiple linear regression in comparison to machine learning models is due to a much higher contribution of the upward flux of wave activity than other predictors to forecast skill...|$|R
