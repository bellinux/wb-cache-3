50|$|Unlike X-rays, {{neutrons}} scatter {{mostly from}} the nuclei of the atoms, which are tiny. Furthermore, {{there is no need}} for an atomic form factor to describe the shape of the electron cloud of the atom and the scattering power of an atom does not fall off with the scattering angle as it does for X-rays. Diffractograms therefore can show strong well defined diffraction peaks even at high angles, particularly if the experiment is done at low temperatures. Many neutron sources are equipped with liquid helium cooling systems that allow data collection at temperatures down to 4.2 K. The superb high angle (i.e. high resolution) information means that the atomic positions in the structure can be determined with high precision. On the other hand, Fourier maps (and to a lesser extent difference Fourier maps) derived from <b>neutron</b> <b>data</b> suffer from series termination errors, sometimes so much that the results are meaningless.|$|E

The objectives of this thesis were 1) to propose modifications of the ENDF/BVI delayed <b>neutron</b> <b>data,</b> 2) to derive new delayed neutron parameters for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 using the summation method, and 3) to establish the relative importance of individual parameters in delayed <b>neutron</b> <b>data</b> sets. The ENDF/B-VI delayed neutron parameters for groups 1 and 2 were reevaluated using a different database than the one used originally. The modified set of delayed <b>neutron</b> <b>data</b> decreases the value of the average delayed neutron lifetime by 15 % for U- 235 thermal fission, which agrees more closely with Keepin's results. The modified delayed <b>neutron</b> <b>data</b> set also improves the calculated reactor period (relative to the reactor period calculated using Keepin's delayed <b>neutron</b> <b>data).</b> In the new six group set of delayed <b>neutron</b> <b>data,</b> the decay constant of group 1 (Al) is equal to the decay constant of the delayed neutron precursor Br- 87 for any fissioning system. A second set of delayed neutron parameters (for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4) were also obtained using the summation method and more recent database. The reactor period calculated using this set agrees within 7 % of the reactor period calculated using Keepin's delayed neutron parameters. Finally, the relative importance of each of the thirteen delayed neutron parameters was established. The calculated reactor period is found to be most sensitive to the value of the delayed neutron fraction (fl), the decay constants for groups 1, 2, and 4, (i. e., Al, A 2, and A 4), and the relative abundances for groups 2, 3, and 4, (i. e., a 2, a 3, and a 4).
