5|$|Greenewalt {{favored the}} bismuth {{phosphate}} process {{due to the}} corrosive nature of lanthanum fluoride, and it was selected for the Hanford separation plants. Once X-10 began producing plutonium, the pilot separation plant was put to the test. The first batch was processed at 40% efficiency but over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> this was raised to 90%.|$|E

5000|$|Phantom {{was awarded}} [...] "Rookie of the Month" [...] at the Cyworld Digital Music Awards for December 2011, {{despite the fact}} that the group hadn't yet made its {{official}} debut. However, they made many performances over the <b>next</b> <b>fews</b> <b>months,</b> appearing alongside popular artists including Verbal Jint, Bizniz, Swings, and Mighty Mouth. The group also appeared in music videos by Verbal Jint, Absalute Music, and Skull.|$|R
5|$|Instead of withdrawing, the British {{remained}} in a forward line of trenches and redoubts. The regiment positioned itself around Karim Abu El Hiseia, on the Wadi Ghuzze. McCarroll assumed {{command of the}} regiment again, Mackesy being appointed as the administrator of the Khan Yunus-Deir and the Belah region. For the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> patrol duty was interspersed with occupying the front line and training.|$|E
5|$|Pope Clement V sent a new papal legate, Gentile Partino da Montefiore, to Hungary. Montefiore {{arrived in}} the summer of 1308. In the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> he persuaded the most {{powerful}} lords one by one to accept Charles's rule. At the Diet, which was held in the Dominican monastery in Pest, Charles was unanimously proclaimed king on 27November 1308. The delegates sent by Matthew Csák and Ladislaus Kán were also present at the assembly.|$|E
5|$|After Combat Rock, the Clash {{began to}} disintegrate. Headon {{was asked to}} leave the band just before the album's release because heroin {{addiction}} was damaging his health and drumming. Chimes was brought back to drum for the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months.</b> The loss of Headon, well-liked by the others, exposed growing friction within the band. Jones and Strummer began to feud. The band opened for the Who on a leg of their final tour in the US, including a show at New York's Shea Stadium.|$|E

50|$|Lotus Development {{released}} Improv in 1991 on the <b>NeXT</b> platform. A <b>few</b> <b>months</b> {{after the}} release of Improv, Brio Technology published a standalone Macintosh implementation, called DataPivot (with technology eventually patented in 1999). Borland purchased the DataPivot technology in 1992 and implemented it in their own spreadsheet application, Quattro Pro.|$|R
5|$|After {{signing with}} Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left the band. The {{remaining}} members then spent the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> {{looking for another}} drummer capable of playing double-time beats at a rapid pace. During this period, the band Good Riddance found their new drummer, and sent Rise Against the audition tape of their number two choice, Brandon Barnes. A mutual friend gave Barnes' phone number to Principe, and after listening to Transistor Revolt, Barnes accepted the band's invitation.|$|E
5|$|Both serials were {{promptly}} {{released on}} iTunes, with DVD releases following over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months.</b> Both on the iTunes and the DVD release, episode 3 of The Web of Fear {{was represented by}} a tele-snap reconstruction, edited by John Kelly. Episode 3 {{had been part of}} the same find, but by the end of protracted negotiations for the return of the film cans, the episode had disappeared from the cache, with the presumption that it was sold to a private collector.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius {{notes that}} this event marked the {{beginning}} of a temporary respite from persecution. Although the precise dating of this respite is not specifically noted by Eusebius, the text of the Martyrs records no Palestinian martyrs between July 25, 308 and November 13, 309. The political climate probably impinged on persecutory policy here: This was the period of the conference of Carnuntum, which met in November 308. Maximinus probably spent the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> in discussion with Galerius over his role in the imperial government, and did not have the time to deal with the Christians.|$|E
50|$|He {{volunteered to}} join the Carabinieri in 1939 and left for Libya the <b>next</b> year, a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> {{before the start of}} the Second World War. After being wounded in the leg, he {{remained}} with his division until he contracted malaria. He returned to Italy in 1942 to attend officer school. He graduated as a vice-sergeant and was assigned to an outpost in Torrimpietra, a little rural center on the Via Aurelia not far from Rome.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the three}} years of the project {{duration}} it was possible to reach the goals of the project. After primarily problems concerning the instrumental development of the flow-through cell a fully automated voltammetric system will be available within the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>month.</b> The automation concludes the sample pre-treatment, the stripping voltammetric measurement and the data analysis. The methodological developments were concentrated on the adsorptive stripping voltammetry. It was possible to divide the total reaction (complexation and adsorption) into its single reactions. Furthermore all complex systems used were classified into two main reaction types. As a consequence of these results an easy optimisation of the parameters for the flow through voltammetric determination is possible. A series of elements were observed due to an analysis in the flow through voltammetric device as uranium and molybdenum with different ligands as well as copper, titanium, cobalt and nickel. The new development simultaneous determination of uranium, antimony and molybdenum was also transferred to the flow system. The possibilities, occurring from electrolyte exchange, enable particularly the speciation analysis of elements. Procedures for the speciation of arsenic, selenium and chromium were developed: Additionally the electrolyte exchange can be used advantageously to reduce the matrix effect of interfering organic sample components. In several cases as for example the anodic stripping voltammetric determination of zinc, cadmium, lead and copper in one run can be performed by means of a calibration instead of the time consuming standard addition method.

5|$|In February 1834, Etty became seriously ill, and was {{incapacitated}} {{for four}} months. Unable to paint, he exhibited only two already-completed {{paintings in the}} 1834 Summer Exhibition, Elizabeth Potts and The Cardinal. In June of that year he left London to convalesce, renting a cottage in York. Weak and unable to concentrate, Etty painted very little, and spend the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> visiting friends and touring the sights of Yorkshire. Gradually regaining his health, he returned to London in December 1834, and resumed work on those paintings he had left incomplete on the onset of his illness.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} envoys of Matthias and Vladislaus Jagiellon {{accelerated}} during the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months.</b> The {{first draft of}} a treaty was agreed upon on 28 March 1478, and the text was completed {{by the end of}} 1477. The treaty authorized both monarchs to use the title of King of Bohemiaalthough Vladislaus could omit to style Matthias as such in their correspondenceand the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were divided between them; Vladislaus ruled in Bohemia proper and Matthias in Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia. They solemnly ratified the peace treaty at their meeting in Olomouc on 21 July.|$|E
5|$|Not {{wanting to}} carry two {{championship}} belts, Ted DiBiase returned the Million Dollar Championship to the WWF, telling an executive {{that he would}} no longer appear with the belt. Money Inc. defended their tag team title against The Natural Disasters at WrestleMania VIII on April 5 and lost the match by countout. Because titles can only change hands via pinfall or submission, Money Inc. retained the belts. Over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> the teams faced each other in rematches on television and at house shows, but Money Inc. managed to retain the title.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, Apple {{merged with}} <b>NeXT.</b> Within a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of the merger, Jobs became CEO {{of his former}} company; he revived Apple at the verge of bankruptcy. Beginning in 1997 with the [...] "Think different" [...] {{advertising}} campaign, Jobs worked closely with designer Jonathan Ive to develop a line of products that would have larger cultural ramifications: the iMac, iTunes and iTunes Store, Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with a completely new Mac OS X, based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the OS a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time.|$|R

40|$|The current upswing {{in solar}} {{activity}} bodies well for accomplishing {{the goals of}} the upcoming HESSI mission. The solar community is making good use of the increased activity through coordinated observations, both in space and on the ground. Ground-based measurements will provide crucial context observations and complementary measurements of the high-energy p,,ocesses which HESSI will observe; vector magnetographs will provide information on the morphology and strength of active region magnetic fields. At the time of the launch of HESSI, we will provide scientific data to the community with the MSFC vector magnetograph and will use the facilities to enhance the educational experience of the local community. In the meantime, to raise public consciousness about the solar cycle and to prepare for HESSI observations, we have prepared lesson plans and activities which are currently being distributed via the internet. Further, to inform the educational community about our activities, our teacher partners disseminate the information by attending teacher conferences. This poster will review what we have already accomplished and what we plan for the <b>next,</b> <b>few</b> pre-launch <b>months...</b>|$|R

During that time, she called at Bayonne, New Jersey; Bermuda; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Balboa, Canal Zone; Jacksonville, Florida; and made return calls at Norfolk, Bayonne, and Bermuda. In addition, the ship visited the New York Naval Shipyard and Davisville, Rhode Island, before being assigned tentatively to TF 68 effective on 9 November.|$|E
5|$|The aborigines signalled their {{surrender}} {{by sending}} {{a few of their}} best weapons to the Dutch, and then by bringing a small tree (often betel nut) planted in earth from their village as a token of the granting of sovereignty to the VOC. Over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> as word of the Dutch victory spread, more and more villages came to pay their respects at Fort Zeelandia and assure the VOC of their friendly intentions. However, the new masters of Mattau also inherited their enemies, with both Favorlang and Tirosen expressing hostility towards the VOC in the wake of their victory.|$|E
50|$|On 15 January 1993, Iraqi {{air defense}} sites {{opened fire on}} two USAF F-111 bombers. On 17 January, Iraqi Su-22s fired on two F-16 jets, and a U.S. F-4 Phantom {{destroyed}} an Iraqi radar which had been targeting French reconnaissance aircraft. Around a half-hour later, an American F-16 shot down an Iraqi MiG-23 Flogger which had crossed into the no-fly zone. The next day, American F-16s bombed Bashiqah Airfield and F-4 Phantoms attacked Iraqi air defense sites. Over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> days and <b>months,</b> more Iraqi sites fired on the American patrols, and several were attacked. That August, the USAF deployed the F-15E Strike Eagle aircraft to Turkey, and on 18 August, these aircraft dropped four laser-guided bombs on an Iraqi SA-3 site near Mosul.|$|R
50|$|Antares, {{like the}} similarly-sized red giant Betelgeuse in the {{constellation}} Orion, will almost certainly explode as a supernova, probably within the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> hundred thousand years.

Executive Director Lori Leblanc of GEST was quoted stated, [...] "Our focus is simply on getting our Coast back to work fueling America. We will be working aggressively over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> weeks and <b>months</b> to get clarification on new rules issued by the BOEM for driling plans and permits, and then to pressure the agency to apply necessary resources to expeditiously process backlogged drilling plans, particularly for deepwater operations, so permits can effectively move through the system." ...|$|R
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> {{were spent}} on {{political}} maneuvering. The increasingly insecure communists, who still had military and administrative {{control over the}} country, were appeased by a compromise in which Solidarity allowed General Jaruzelski to remain head of state. Jaruzelski barely won {{the vote in the}} National Assembly presidential election of 19 July 1989, even though his name was the only one on the ballot. He won through an informally arranged abstention by a sufficient number of Solidarity MPs and his position was not strong. Jaruzelski resigned as first secretary of the PZPR on 29 July.|$|E
5|$|Wasp and Henry sailed from New York on June 21, 1822, and {{remained}} together {{as far as}} the Falkland Islands. They then separated, Wasp travelling east in search of sealing grounds. Morrell's account of the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> of the voyage, in Antarctic and subantarctic waters, is controversial. His claims of distances, latitudes and discoveries have been challenged as inaccurate or impossible, giving substance to his reputation among his contemporaries for untruth, and leading to much criticism by later writers.|$|E
5|$|After Rhodes and the London {{consortium}} {{agreed to}} pool their interests, Rhodes travelled to London, arriving in March 1889. His amalgamated charter bid gathered great political and popular support over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>months,</b> prompting the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, {{to approve the}} royal charter, which was formally granted in October 1889. The Company occupied and annexed Mashonaland about a year later.

5000|$|The title {{remained}} inactive for 25 {{years until}} being revived by AWA Superstars in late 2005. The storyline {{behind this title}} began in Millennium Wrestling Federation, then the AWA affiliate promotion for New England, during the feud between [...] "The Extreme Strongman" [...] Gino Martino and Ox Baker. Baker claimed that he and The Crusher got into a brawl at Lisowski's bar in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1981, leaving with the brass knuckles title after knocking out Lisowski in the bar-room brawl. Baker then had the title, in actuality a trophy, melted down into a championship belt. He then used the brass knuckles title to lure Martino into a match {{with a member of}} Ox Baker's Army. On September 24, Martino won the title after defeating Kamala the Ugandan Giant in a [...] "King of the Jungle" [...] death match at the MWF's [...] "Road to the Gold" [...] in Lynn, Massachusetts. A title defense against The Missing Link at [...] "Soul Survivor III" [...] on November 5, 2005, ended in a no-contest. In the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> two <b>months</b> he also defended the title against The Outpatient, Leo Venis, and Makua of The Big Islanders in both No Disqualification and Falls Count Anywhere matches.|$|R
