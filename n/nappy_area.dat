40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) {{is essentially}} diagnosed clinically. In babies and young children, {{the diagnosis is}} usually straightforward. Dry, very pruritic dermatitis starts on the cheeks, with the neck and trunk often involved, but the <b>nappy</b> <b>area</b> spared. Limb involvement follows later â€“ first extensoral, later classically flexural. This is mostly the picture of AD. In adults, the presentation may vary widely. Classic flexural dermatitis may persist, but erythroderma (whole-body involvement), head and neck dermatitis, isolated hand dermatitis and nummular dermatitis may {{be more difficult to}} identify as AD.
