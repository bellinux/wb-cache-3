Releases of fire-ant-decapitating phorid flies {{have been made in}} several southern states. Mass rearing and additional releases of these flies {{are underway}} now. Experimental releases of a disease-causing protozoan have been made in ten southern states. A number of least-toxic <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> control materials are discussed. Sources for some materials are provided in the Resources section. Physical controls such as hot water, steam, and ant traps are discussed. <b>Fire</b> <b>Ant</b> Ecology and Biological Controls The red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> Solenopsis invicta, arrived in the U. S. from central Brazil between 1933 and 1945 by hitchhiking on ship cargo. Though S. invicta has become quite a pest, not all <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> species have achieved pest status. The black imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> Solenopsis richteri, arrived before the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> sometime around 1918. S. invicta has out-competed its black cousins and also crossed with them, creating hybrids between the two species (1). The Texas red ant, S. geminata, a native <b>American</b> <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> found in much of Texas, is not considered a pest. The red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> prospers in open sunny areas such as cropland, pastures, and urban lawns. It is an insect of disturbed, low-diversity habitats.

While I was gone, large wildfires occurred on the Indian reservations where I had planned summer work in my home state of Washington, USA. I am not surprised that the fires in Canada and the western US were being covered by the international media in almost real time. My colleagues in the countries I was visiting had trouble understanding why countries such as the US, with its good fire science and fire fighting resources, continue to have these large and destructive fires. The questions always led to what lessons can be learned from the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>fires</b> that can be applied to other countries with less developed fire sciences and minuscule resources.|$|R
40|$|The {{summer of}} 2004 {{was one of}} the largest fire seasons on record for Alaska and western Canada.

The inventory is constructed by combining daily area burned reports and MODIS fire hot spots with estimates of fuel consumption and emission factors based on ecosystem type. We estimate the contribution from peat burning using drainage and peat distribution maps for Alaska and Canada; 17 % of the reported 5. 1 × 106 ha burned were located in peatlands in 2004. Our total estimate of <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>fire</b> emissions during the summer of 2004 is 30 Tg CO, including 11 Tg from peat.

40|$|The red {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> Solenopsis invicta Buren, is an invasive pest {{that has}} become widespread in the southern United States and Caribbean after introduction from South America in the 1930 s. This species, which has diverse detrimental impacts on recipient communities, was recently discovered in Australia and New Zealand and {{has the potential to}} colonize numerous other regions. We used a dynamic, ecophysiological model of colony growth to predict the potential global range expansion of this invasive species. Based on minimum and maximum daily temperatures, the model estimates colony alate production and predicts future geographic range limits. Because S. invicta populations are limited by arid conditions as well as cold temperatures, we superimposed precipitation data upon temperature-based predictions, to identify regions that do not receive enough rainfall to support this species across the landscape. Many areas around the globe, including large portions of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and numerous island nations, are at risk for S. invicta infestation. Quarantine officials should be vigilant for any accidental introductions of this pest in susceptible regions. Costs of eradication increase dramatically as the area of infestation grows, and large infestations may be impossible to eradicate. Other South <b>American</b> Solenopsis <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> (e. g., S. richteri Forel) may become invasive if the opportunity arises, and our predictions for S. invicta may approximate the potential range limits for these species as well...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the year}} 2025, {{wildland}} fire fighting practices have improved significantly over the method employed {{during the late}} 1900 's. Improved methods for predicting severe fire weather conditions, {{the establishment of the}} <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>Fire</b> Coordination Center, and the utilization of foam products for both wildfire and structural fire control have significantly changed the methods of fire suppression. An increased awareness of the dangers posed by wildfire has been accomplished through a concentrated effort to educate the public. Buildings are being constructed that afford greater protection, and fuel modification surrounding structures is now required by most state and provincial governments. With the accomplishments achieved during the past 40 years (1985 - 2025) it's hard to believe that wildland fire protection could become more efficient or effective, but I am sure it will! In this paper I discuss the wildland/urban fire problem as I see it in the year 2000 and beyond. I have chosen to base most of my projections on the year 2025. Before I do this, I will define the wildland/urban problem, and then look at how we have {{gotten to the point where}} we are in 1987.

40|$|Abstract. Betula glandulosa survives over a {{wide range}} of <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>fire</b> regimes by resprouting from the rhizome. Over-winter root {{carbohydrate}} reserves are important to sprout production and growth in the following spring. Nursery and field experiments were conducted {{to examine the effects of}} seasonal clipping and fire severity (lethal heat applied to different soil depths) on B. glandulosa sprouting and growth, and seasonal burning and clipping on over-winter root carbohydrate storage. Low fire severity increased sprout numbers, and low fire severity in spring caused a large increase in height growth and above-ground biomass production over a 2 -year period. Mortality rates increased sharply with higher levels of fire severity. Over-winter total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations in roots were significantly higher in plants burned immediately after leaf-flush than in mid-summer burned plants. None of the other seasonal burning or clipping treatments significantly influenced over-winter root TNC. Post-disturbance sprout growth reflected over-winter root TNC levels. B. glandulosa survives a wide range of fire frequencies by growing in plant communities that are most likely to burn in spring or autumn, and seldom burn in summer. This provides the greatest opportunity for maximum over-winter TNC storage. As well, high soil moisture after snowmelt ensures spring fires are almost always of low severity, which promotes increased sprout production, height growth and above-ground biomass...|$|R
40|$|A {{predictive}} equation for estimating fire frequency {{was developed}} from theories and data in physical chemistry, ecosystem ecology, and climatology. We {{refer to this}} equation as the Physical Chemistry Fire Frequency Model (PC 2 FM). The equation was cal-ibrated and validated with <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>fire</b> data (170 sites) prior to widespread industrial influences (before 1850 CE) related to land use, fire sup-pression, and recent climate change to minimize non-climatic effects. We derived and validated the empirically based PC 2 FM {{for the purpose of}} esti-mating mean fire intervals (MFIs) from proxies of mean maximum temperature, precipitation, their interaction, and estimated reactant concentrations. Parameterization of the model uses reaction rate equations based on the concentration and physical chemistry of fuels and climate. The model was then calibrated and validated using centuries of empirical fire history data. An application of the PC 2 FM regression equation is presented and used to esti-mate historic MFI as controlled by climate. We discuss the effects of temperature, precipitation, and their interactions on fire frequency using the PC 2 FM concept and results. The exclusion of topographic, vegetation, and ignition variables from the PC 2 FM increased error at fine spatial scales, but allowed for the prediction of complex climate effects at broader temporal and spatial scales. The PC 2 FM equation is used to map coarse-scale historic fire frequency and assess climate impacts on landscape-scale fire regimes.
