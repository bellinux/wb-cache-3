40|$|Abstract. The superpotential in the Landau-Ginzburg {{construction}} of {{solutions to the}} Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (or WDVV) equations is modified to include logarithmic terms. This results in deformations- quadratic in the deformation parameters- of the normal prepotential solution of the WDVV equations. Such solution satisfy various pseudo-quasi-homogeneity conditions, on assigning a <b>notional</b> <b>weight</b> to the deformation parameters. This construction includes, as a special case, deformations which are polynomial in the flat coordinates, resulting in {{a new class of}} polynomial solutions of the WDVV equations. 1...|$|E
40|$|Markowitz’s {{portfolio}} selection model posits {{a linear}} {{relationship between the}} return of a portfolio and the returns of its component securities. This linear relationship does not hold in an ex post setting when sample returns are computed in the usual way. We propose using a priori <b>notional</b> price <b>weights</b> to determine ex post notional prices. Then the corre-sponding linear returns do satisfy the hypotheses of Markowitz’s model, {{and the meaning of}} a portfolio, as a list of security proportions, is unambiguous. 1 The Standard Portfolio Selection Model In the mean-variance portfolio selection model of Markowitz [1987, pg. 1] an investor is to choose fractions p 1, p 2, [...] ., pn invested in n securities subject to constraints n∑ j= 1 pj = 1, pj ≥ 0 (j = 1, [...] ., n). (M 1. 1) We suppose that the returns this period on individual securi-ties r 1, r 2, [...] ., rn are jointly distributed random variables, and the return on the portfolio is R = n∑ j= 1 rjpj. (M 1. 2) The expected (mean) return of the portfolio as a whole is E = E(R) = n∑ j= 1 ejpj, (M 1. 3) where ej = E(rj) (j = 1, [...] ., n) (M 1. 4) and the E is the expected value operator. This is almost an exact quote. We have changed some of the symbols and the order of multiplication to suit our purposes. Most importantly, the middle expression, E(R), has been inserted in (M 1. 3) to help make the point of this article: that equations (M 1. 2) and (M 1. 3) are not gen-erally valid in an ex post setting with the usual method of computing returns...|$|R
