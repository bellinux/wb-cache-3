5000|$|British {{archaeologist}} D.G. Hogarth published The <b>Nearer</b> <b>East</b> in 1902, {{in which}} he stated his view of [...] "The Near East": [...] The <b>Nearer</b> <b>East</b> is a term of current fashion for a region which our grandfathers were content to call simply The East. Its area is generally understood to coincide with those classic lands, historically the most interesting {{on the surface of}} the globe, which lie about the eastern basin of the Mediterranean Sea; but few probably could say offhand where should be the limits and why. Hogarth then proceeds to say where and why in some detail, but no more mention is made of the classics. His analysis is geopolitical. His map delineates the <b>Nearer</b> <b>East</b> with regular lines as though surveyed. They include Iran, the Balkans, but not the Danube lands, Egypt, but not the rest of North Africa. Except for the Balkans, the region matches the later Middle East. It differs from the Ottoman Empire of the times in including Greece and Iran. Hogarth gives no evidence of being familiar with the contemporaneous initial concept of the Middle East.|$|R

In 720BC, he sent an army {{in support of a}} rebellion against Assyria, which was taking place in Philistia and Gaza. However, Piye was defeated by Sargon II and the rebellion failed. In 711BC, Piye again supported a revolt against Assyria by the Israelites of Ashdod and was once again defeated by the Assyrian king Sargon II. Subsequently, Piye was forced from the <b>Near</b> <b>East.</b>|$|E
5|$|The center's design {{reflects}} {{the architecture of}} the <b>Near</b> <b>East.</b> It is constructed of cast concrete. Hand-carved Jerusalem limestone adorn the building, according to local custom. The use of arches and domes closely models other building of Jerusalem and the gardens throughout the center contain many trees and other plants named in the Bible. The interior contains the arches and cupolas typical of the <b>Near</b> <b>East,</b> and large, windowed pavilions provide wide views of Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|Analysis {{of central}} European cattle, {{including}} Limousins, {{indicates that the}} origin {{of male and female}} DNA can be traced directly to cattle domesticated in the <b>Near</b> <b>East.</b> This is in contrast to the DNA of northern European cattle, which suggests that wild Eurasian aurochs were at one time mated to domesticated cows, and of southern European cattle, which indicates that wild Eurasian aurochs cows were mated to domesticated bulls.|$|E
5|$|Childe {{continued}} {{writing and}} publishing books on archaeology, {{beginning with a}} series of works following on from The Dawn of European Civilisation and The Aryans by compiling and synthesising data from across Europe. First was The Most Ancient <b>Near</b> <b>East</b> (1928), which assembled information from across Mesopotamia and India, setting a background from which the spread of farming and other technologies into Europe could be understood. This was followed by The Danube in Prehistory (1929) which examined the archaeology along the Danube river, recognising it as the natural boundary dividing the <b>Near</b> <b>East</b> from Europe; Childe believed that it was via the Danube that new technologies travelled westward in prehistory. The book introduced the concept of an archaeological culture to Britain from Germany, revolutionising the theoretical approach of British archaeology.|$|E
5|$|During the Armenian Genocide, {{the cathedral}} of Etchmiadzin and its {{surrounding}} became a major center for the Turkish Armenian refugees.

A hospital and an orphanage within the cathedral's grounds were established and maintained by the U.S.-based Armenian <b>Near</b> <b>East</b> Relief by 1919.|$|E

5|$|Lycia {{occupied}} a strategic position between Europe and the <b>Near</b> <b>East.</b> The Greek and Persian worlds met in Lycia, and the Lycians were {{heavily influenced by}} both.

5|$|Recent {{studies of}} the DNA of European cattle and {{fragments}} of Eurasian aurochs, in particular female mitochondrial DNA and male Y chromosomes, indicate that the link between modern Limousins and their presumed Eurasian aurochs ancestors {{is more complex than}} originally thought. While many European cattle breeds probably evolved from domesticated <b>Near</b> <b>East</b> ancestors, their genetics were heavily influenced by different herd management approaches across Europe.|$|E
