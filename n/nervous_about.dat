5|$|Ben Palmer, the {{director}} of the first Inbetweeners film, was involved with Simon Pegg's film Man Up, so Morris and Beesley directed The Inbetweeners 2. Bird said that the actors were initially disheartened by the absence of Palmer, and <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the direction of Morris and Beesley due to their lack of experience in the position.|$|E
5|$|On the {{conservative}} side, foreign policy {{used to be}} anti-communist, but not very pro-democracy. And foreign policy liberal-style might be piously pro-democracy, but <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> being anti-communist. Tom theorized that to be either, {{you had to be}} both.|$|E

5|$|The Wachowskis asked Joe Pantoliano {{to watch}} John Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and {{to focus on}} Humphrey Bogart's {{character}} in order to prepare the paranoia of Caesar. Gershon's influences for her role were James Dean, Marlon Brando and Clint Eastwood. Both Gershon and Tilly were <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> filming the sex scenes and prepared by drinking tequila.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin was <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the film's {{reception}} because silent {{films were}} becoming obsolete by then, and the preview had undermined his confidence. Nevertheless, City Lights {{became one of}} Chaplin's most financially successful and critically acclaimed works. Following the good reception by American audiences, with earnings of $2 million, a quarter of which came from its 12-week run at the Cohan, Chaplin went on a sixteen-date world tour between February and March 1932, starting with a premiere at London's Dominion Theatre on February 27. The film was enthusiastically received by Depression-era audiences, earning $5 million during its initial release.|$|E

40|$|Biogenic amines like {{dopamine}} or octopamine modify neural {{function at}} multiple levels, sensitizing or depressing behaviour. Recent studies in insects have now shown that, besides {{a role in}} motivational modulation, biogenic amines substitute the reinforcer function in associative learning, thus instructing the <b>nervous</b> system <b>about</b> the relevance of external events...|$|R
5|$|Donald Petrie was {{originally}} signed {{to direct the}} episode, but dropped out to direct the film Mystic Pizza. Executive producer Robert Justman brought in Rob Bowman to direct his first Star Trek episode. Justman later {{said that this was}} one of his most-significant achievements on The Next Generation. Bowman worked on storyboards and set blocking for twenty days before shooting the episode. He was initially <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> working on the show, and felt he had to prove himself because of his relative inexperience as a director. Bowman said that after the second day of filming it became easier, and credited the crew with making him feel welcome. He went on to direct twelve more episodes of The Next Generation.|$|E
5|$|Erik and Ashley begin dating, but {{on their}} first date at a restaurant, Erik has hot soup spilled accidentally on his legs, so Ashley brings him to her room to clean up. As Ashley rubs lotion on Erik's thigh, he {{develops}} an involuntary erection and accidentally ejaculates over her possessions. Erik apologizes and explains to Ashley that, after breaking up with Tracy, he has not ejaculated in four months, masturbation being a taboo in his house because of a previous incident. Meanwhile, Cooze {{falls in love with}} Ashley's roommate Denise; however, she is <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> showing her genitalia and having sex with him, so she gives Cooze a handjob instead. After talking with Erik, Bobby, and Dwight about Denise, Cooze develops suspicions that Denise might have a penis, so Dwight encourages him to find out.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the group}} wanted to release an album cover using an edited image from a Holy Communion card, showing {{children}} joining hands. The image had been photocopied several times, {{so it had}} become distorted. The art direction was by John Maybury, a college friend of Morris. Their manager, Stevenson, was unable to determine who owned the copyright and advised that the band would be bankrupted if they were sued as a result. Polydor also became <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> copyright infringement, so the artwork was pulled at the last minute; the record company's executives also disliked its religious nature. A UK tour had already been scheduled {{to coincide with the}} release of the album, so there was no possibility of delaying the release.|$|E
5000|$|The {{syndrome}} {{gets its}} name from the characteristic cry of affected infants, which {{is similar to that of}} a meowing kitten, due to problems with the larynx and <b>nervous</b> system. <b>About</b> 1/3 of children lose the cry by age of 2 years. Other symptoms of cri du chat syndrome may include: ...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{cynical and}} despairing over his recent break-up with ex-girlfriend Felicia, the normally-grumpy Bolander (Ned Beatty) is unusually cheerful {{as a result}} of his budding romantic relationship with Linda (Julianna Margulies), a much younger (26-year-old) waitress. <b>Nervous</b> <b>about</b> his first real date with her, Bolander asks Howard (Melissa Leo) to go on a double-date with him, along with Howard's boyfriend, prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek). The double date goes well until a lonely Munch crashes, joins the table and ruins the mood of the evening complaining about his romantic woes. Bolander, Munch and Linda leave together and walk to Fort McHenry, where Linda offers Munch words of encouragement. Impressed with her, Munch leaves Linda and Bolander alone, where they happily watch a fireworks show.|$|E
5|$|Mitra had met Ray {{on the set}} of The River, where Mitra {{was allowed}} to observe the production, take {{photographs}} and make notes about lighting for personal reference. Having become friends, Mitra kept Ray informed about the production and showed his photographs. Ray was impressed enough by them to promise him an assistant's position on Pather Panchali, and when production neared, invited him to shoot the film. As the 21-year-old Mitra had no prior filmmaking experience, the choice was met with scepticism by those who knew of the production. Mitra himself later speculated that Ray was <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> working with an established crew.|$|E
5|$|The speech clearly impresses {{both the}} judges and Leslie, and Pawnee is {{ultimately}} {{selected for the}} tournament. Leslie reluctantly accepts Ben's invitation to a celebratory dinner that night, where Ben brings up his feelings for Leslie. She slips away to call Ann for advice, and she urges Leslie to act on her feelings. Just as Leslie decides to do so, she is surprised to find Chris has arrived at the dinner to congratulate the two personally. He insists they sleep {{at his home in}} Indianapolis, ruining their night. The next day, Leslie and Ben run into each other alone and Ben reveals Chris is out for the day. Ben then immediately kisses her, leaving Leslie simultaneously delighted and <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> their future.|$|E

50|$|Stevens {{was under}} the care of a {{neurologist}} for a year before she died. She had been treated for a nervous breakdown. Wilson attended Stevens over the Christmas and New Year's holidays in the absence of her neurologist. He found Stevens in a highly <b>nervous</b> state <b>about</b> a week before her demise. Wilson administered a hypodermic injection to which Stevens responded successfully.|$|R
5|$|While {{filming the}} scene where Keller and her team perform a Decompressive {{craniectomy}} on Weir, an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away, and directed the cast on what to do. While following the surgeon, Staite was <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> doing the scene. After filming was completed, the surgeon's voice {{was removed from the}} final cut. During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field, the producers wanted {{the scene where}} Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic as possible, so in the control room, not only the cameras, but the screens and tables on the set were shaken slightly as well.|$|E
5|$|Hard Target was Woo's first American {{film and}} {{was also the first}} major Hollywood film made by a Chinese {{director}}. Universal Pictures was <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> having Woo direct a feature, and sent in director Sam Raimi to look over the film's production and to take Woo's place as director if he were to fail. Woo went through several scripts finding mostly martial arts films with which he was not interested. After deciding on Chuck Pfarrer's script for Hard Target, Woo wanted to have actor Kurt Russell in the lead role, but found Russell too busy with other projects. Woo then went with Universal's initial choice of having Jean-Claude Van Damme star. Woo got along with Van Damme during filming and raised the amount of action in the film as he knew that Van Damme was up for it.|$|E
5|$|In October 1957 (early in {{his second}} year of law school), Kennedy met Joan Bennett at Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York, {{following}} a dedication speech for a gymnasium that his family had donated at the campus. Bennett was a senior there, had worked as a model and won beauty contests, but she was unfamiliar with the world of politics. After the couple became engaged, she grew <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> marrying someone she did not know that well, but Joe Kennedy insisted that the wedding should proceed. The couple was married by Cardinal Francis Spellman on November 29, 1958, at St. Joseph's Church in Bronxville, New York, with the reception being held at the nearby Siwanoy Country Club. Together, Ted and Joan had three children: Kara (1960–2011), Ted Jr. (b. 1961) and Patrick (b.1967). By the 1970s, the marriage was in trouble due to Ted's womanizing and Joan's growing alcoholism.|$|E

5|$|NASA takes both Homer and Barney to Cape Canaveral for training. As {{only one}} of them can go into space, they soon find {{themselves}} in competition. Under NASA's alcohol ban, the newly sober Barney quickly develops superior skills and is selected to fly with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Race Banyon. However, when Barney toasts his victory with non-alcoholic champagne, he inexplicably reverts to his normal alcoholic self and escapes, stealing a jetpack and crashing into a nearby pillow factory. Homer wins by default and is selected for space flight, but after watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy involving space exploration, he becomes very <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> going. Just as they prepare to take off in the Corvair space shuttle, Homer runs away. He talks with Marge on the phone, and she says that he ought {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity. He agrees, and the launch, which is also a Nielsen ratings smash, proceeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Kimihiko Fujisaka. Fujisaka, who was acquainted with Sakaguchi, was brought on board the project at the beginning. At that point, only a simple plot outline had been created, and Sakaguchi showed this to Fujisaka and asked what he visualized from it. Due to this, Fujisaka {{had a lot of}} leeway in his designs. Due to Sakaguchi living in Hawaii while the game was being developed, Fujisaka was initially <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> working with him on the project, but ultimately he found their working relationship to be a positive one. An aspect that worried Fujisaka during the early stages was the decision to have the characters able to change their clothing: their original appearances had been designed in relation to their lines, and while designing extra outfits proved difficult, he ultimately enjoyed the experience. Fujisaka also worked as a world designer, initially feeling restricted by the console's limited graphics. According to Fujisaka, the city hub began taking shape in 2009, relatively early in development. The world design he initially created was fairly bleak, but after Nintendo insisted on the scenario being changed, he redesigned it around a brighter fantasy aesthetic.|$|E
5|$|The {{dampening}} {{of public}} enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued {{and the police}} and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing shows down. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew <b>nervous</b> <b>about</b> the negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities. Merrick's group of managers decided that he should go on tour in Continental Europe, {{with the hope that}} authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the Continent. The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by this new manager, who stole Merrick's £50 (2015 equivalent £) savings. Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to Ostend, where he attempted to board a ferry for Dover but was refused passage. He travelled to Antwerp and was able to board a ship bound for Harwich in Essex. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at Liverpool Street station.|$|E
