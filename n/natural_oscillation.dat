Methods. The finite and element model of an object in a program complex of ING + according to the spatial slabby and rod diagram is developed by the finite-element method. A slabby grillage, plates of overlapping and a covering, a wall and a diaphragm of rigidness were modelled by triangular cover elements with 18 levels of freedom and quadrangular cover elements with the 24 th freedom levels. Columns were modelled by spatial rods with 12 levels of freedom. Spatial rigidness of a frame is provided with collaboration of columns, diaphragms of rigidness and plates of overlappings. The estimated diagram is developed taking into account rigid seal of columns, diaphragms of rigidness and walls in a monolithic slabby grillage. Results.

In this paper, we discuss how these aspects can be analyzed and changed using mathematical models of the dynamics, as opposed to using only engineering intuition and experimental results. First, we describe how the loss of energy due to impact can be influenced by the mass distribution and posture of a robot. Second, we discuss a numerical optimization method to find how the <b>natural</b> <b>oscillations</b> in the mechanism can be influenced by using optimal springs that minimize energy requirements from the actuators.
