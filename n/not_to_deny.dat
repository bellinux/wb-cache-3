However, academics and writers dispute his importance. 19th and early 20th century historians held him to be the crucial figure of the British Agricultural Revolution, crediting him with inventing four-crop rotation. Naomi Riches describes this as an [...] "error", and R.A.C. Parker, writing in the Economic History Review, states that [...] "many of the innovations he is supposed to have introduced should be attributed to his predecessors in Norfolk"; however that [...] "is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> the substantial contribution of Coke himself to the advance of farming technique in England".|$|E

But this is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> that Hordern's simian habit of scratching his left earlobe with right hand or leaning over his desk {{as if he is}} doing intellectual press-ups is very funny to watch or that he is brilliant at displaying cuckolded curiosity." [...] Harold Hobson, the drama critic, thought that failing to enjoy the play was [...] "not actually a criminal offence but it is a sad evidence of illiteracy". Jumpers won the Evening Standard 's Best Play Award which, much to Hordern's amusement, was presented by the philosopher A. J. Ayer.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the reasons}} that the strongest of these {{photographs}} appear so abstract is that they are void of any reference points. Stieglitz was not concerned with a particular orientation for many of these prints, and he was known to exhibit them sideways or upside down from how he originally mounted them. Photography historian Sarah Greenough points out that by doing so Stieglitz [...] "was destabilizing your [...] relationship with nature in order to have you think less about nature, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> that it's a photograph of a cloud, but to think more about the feeling that the cloud formation evokes."

2500|$|... "Irresistible grace", {{also called}} [...] "efficacious grace", {{asserts that the}} saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom he has {{determined}} to save (that is, the elect) and overcomes their resistance to obeying {{the call of the}} gospel, bringing them to a saving faith. This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved. The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God's Holy Spirit cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, [...] "graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ." [...] This is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> the fact that the Spirit's outward call (through the proclamation of the Gospel) can be, and often is, rejected by sinners; rather, it's that inward call which cannot be rejected.|$|E

2500|$|Literary {{reviewer}} Cosmin Ciotloș nevertheless noted: [...] "Z. Ornea's book on {{the thirties}} is no less {{a book about the}} nineties, when it was finally written and published." [...] To support this assessment, Ciotloș identifies an allusion to the radically nationalist magazine România Mare, founded by politician Corneliu Vadim Tudor in the 1990s, as well as direct parallels drawn by the author between the Iron Guard's guidelines and the various tenets of Romanian communism. The chronicler also noted that this approach did not lack [...] "analytical balance", arguing: [...] "Anii treizeci. Extrema dreaptă românească is equally far from supporting a plea and insinuating an indictment. Therefore, this study benefits not just from a proper scientific location, but also from a correct political positioning." [...] Ornea himself also noted that the purpose of his investigation was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> merit to those Romanian intellectuals who had value beyond their political commitment, but expressed the opinion that Eliade's far right commitment of the 1930s had more serious consequences than the post-1945 acceptance of communist guidelines by George Călinescu, Mihai Ralea or Tudor Vianu (who, he claimed, compromised their values so as to preserve some academic standard during [...] "harsh times").|$|E
2500|$|Underlying {{the concept}} of [...] "mind uploading" [...] (more {{accurately}} [...] "mind transferring") is the broad philosophy that consciousness lies within the brain's information processing and is in essence an emergent feature that arises from large neural network high-level patterns of organization, and that the same patterns of organization can be realized in other processing devices. Mind uploading also relies {{on the idea that}} the human mind (the [...] "self" [...] and the long-term memory), just like non-human minds, is represented by the current neural network paths and the weights of the brain synapses rather than by a dualistic and mystic soul and spirit. The mind or [...] "soul" [...] can be defined as the information state of the brain, and is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file or the state of a computer software currently residing in the work-space memory of the computer. Data specifying the information state of the neural network can be captured and copied as a [...] "computer file" [...] from the brain and re-implemented into a different physical form. This is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> that minds are richly adapted to their substrates. An analogy to the idea of mind uploading is to copy the temporary information state (the variable values) of a computer program from the computer memory to another computer and continue its execution. The other computer may perhaps have different hardware architecture but emulates the hardware of the first computer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{language}} of section 127 {{does not include}} the words statistic or census, and consequently the Commonwealth had the power to collect data on the Aboriginal populace, though what was collected lacked quality and comprehensiveness. [...] Its purpose was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> information to the government but to give effect to a belief that the indigenous peoples of Australia were separate from the colonists joining together to form a nation. [...] From the arrival of the First Fleet, the Aboriginal peoples were considered British subjects but not citizens, and when Federation occurred, the [...] "Australian governments and the people had no use for the Aborigines." [...] Consideration of the indigenous population was limited to the [...] "problem" [...] of the potential for their number to influence the composition of the House of Representatives, and that was [...] "solved" [...] with section 127. [...] Actual responsibility for the Aboriginal people was left to the individual states (explaining their exclusion from race power), who [...] "considered [...] as the 'native' flora and fauna." [...] Constitutional scholar George Williams has described the race power and section 127 as part of the racism in Australia's constitutional DNA. In the 1960s in the lead-up to the repeal of section 127, racist attitudes towards Aborigines were openly expressed. [...] For example, the Sydney Morning Herald characterised the idea of trying to count the indigenous population as part of the census as both [...] "a mildly entertaining historical oddity" [...] and as [...] "more difficult than rounding up a mob of wild brumbies".|$|E

2500|$|The early 20th century Oxford {{professor}} Samuel Rolles Driver {{taught that}} [...] sets out the fundamental truth of Israel's religion, the uniqueness and unity of God, and the fundamental duty founded upon it of the devotion to God of the Israelite's entire being. Reading [...] Driver asked {{in what sense}} the word [...] "One" [...] is to be understood: Does it express the Unity of God, declaring that God is in God's essence indivisible, and cannot — like Ba'al and Ashtoret, for instance, who are often spoken of in the plural — assume different phases or attributes, as presiding over different localities, or different departments of nature, and cannot further be united syncretistically with other deities; but is only known under the one character by which God has revealed God’s Self to Israel? Or does the word [...] "One" [...] denote the Uniqueness of God, representing God in a unique sense, as the God with whom no other god can be compared, as the only Deity to whom the true attributes of the Godhead really belong? Driver taught that the second interpretation gives the higher and fuller meaning to the term, and forms also a more adequate basis for the practical duty inculcated in [...] for a God, who was not unique might not necessarily be a worthy object of human love. Driver taught that the first interpretation, however, is not excluded by the second, for the unity of God is almost a necessary corollary of God's Uniqueness. Driver concluded that [...] is thus a great declaration of Monotheism in the sense both {{that there is only}} one God, and also that the God who exists is truly One. Driver taught that the truth is one which in its full significance was only gradually brought home to the Israelites and was hardly explicitly enunciated much before the age of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah. Driver read verses like [...] ( [...] in the KJV), and [...] to imply that God is superior to [...] "other gods" [...] or that [...] "other gods" [...] cannot be compared to God, but <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>deny</b> the real existence of [...] "other gods." [...] Driver argued that it was only gradually seen distinctly, and taught explicitly, not only that God is unique among [...] "other gods," [...] but that [...] "other gods" [...] have no real existence whatever beside God.|$|E
