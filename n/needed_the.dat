40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{measure of}} multiple motives (EMMM) is presented. The EMMM enables researchers to make quick exploratory assessments {{of a relatively}} large number of general motives. It includes 14 single-item self-report measures that assess self-control, self-esteem, sensation-seeking, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for acquisition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for affect, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for cognition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for meaning, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for power, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for precision, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for self-consistency, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for structure, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for uniqueness, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to belong, and <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to buffer anxiety about death. Each single-item measure is sourced from previously-established psychometric scales. The EMMM’s rationale, development, operationalization, analysis, and exploratory nature are discussed, and evidence is provided for the divergent and convergent validity of its items. It {{is considered to be}} the Swiss Army knife of motivation measures: A small but versatile tool for understanding the complexity of human attitudes and behaviours...|$|R
