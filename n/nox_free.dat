25|$|Th1 {{helper cells}} are the host {{immunity}} effectors against intracellular bacteria and protozoa. They are triggered by IL-12, IL-2 and their effector cytokine is IFN-γ. The main effector cells of Th1 immunity are macrophages {{as well as}} CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IFN-γ CD4 T cells. The key Th1 transcription factors are STAT4 and T-bet. IFN-γ secreted by CD4 T cells can activate macrophages to phagocytose and digest intracellular bacteria and protozoa. In addition, IFN-γ can activate iNOS to produce <b>NOx</b> <b>free</b> radicals to directly kill intracellular bacteria and protozoa. Th1 overactivation against autoantigens will cause Type 4 delayed-type hypersensitivity. Tuberculin reaction or Type 1 diabetes belong to this category of autoimmunity.|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of {{dissertation}} consists of development of a QSAR model for 229 mutagenic aromatic amines and a QSPR model of partial molar volumes of amino acids. A common procedure for QSAR analysis consist of data selection (generally sets of homologous series of compounds and their corresponding biological activities), tabulation of trial physicochemical or molecular structural descriptors, followed by a multilinear statistical analysis to derive a statistically valid QSAR correlation of the activity data making use of {{a subset of the}} trial descriptors. A final important step is cross-validation to assess the putative predictive (rather than just correlative) capabilities of the derived QSAR model equation. The results of a very successful elementary QSA(/P) R studies using substituent indicator variables, coupled with calculated theoretical parameters for the compounds in the work outlined above are presented. ^ The second part of the dissertation illustrates that betalactoglobulin and human serum albumin {{can be used as a}} vehicle to improve the bioavailability of curcumin and it’s derivatives. Curcumin a major component of Indian spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), possesses diverse anti-inflammatory, antitumour and antioxidant properties. Several studies have confirmed that curcumin can reduce the oxidative/nitrosative stress and there by decrease the neuronal attrition. But the bioavailability of curcumin is poor and has raised several concerns regarding limited clinical impact. The aim of this study was to find molecules similar to curcumin which can assist in decreasing nitrosative stress and possess enhanced bioavailability. Here, we examined the use of beta-lactoglobulin as a vehicle to transport molecules to the gut. Curcumin analogs were searched from Zinc database and 6457 compounds were selected for the study. These compounds were docked to betalactoglobulin using Glide to find the best fit ligands. Our findings indicated four compounds that have better binding to betalactoglobulin and efficient <b>NOx</b> (<b>free</b> radical) scavenging activity. ...|$|E

Amongst the major complications of diabetes mellitus are retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy and accelerated atherosclerosis. Increased bioavailability of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (termed oxidative stress), derived in large part from the NADPH oxidase (<b>Nox)</b> family of <b>free</b> radical producing enzymes, has been demonstrated in experimental and clinical diabetes and has been implicated in the cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes. The present review focuses {{on the role of}} Noxs and oxidative stress in some major complications of diabetes, including nephropathy, retinopathy and atherosclerosis. We also discuss Nox isoforms as potential targets for therapy...|$|R
40|$|Ozone plays {{a central}} role in the {{chemistry}} of the atmosphere both as an ultraviolet shield and as a source of hydroxyl radicals (OH), a potent initiator of atmospheric chemistry. There is evidence to suggest that the ozone abundance in the troposphere (0 - 10 km) has doubled since the industrial revolution and continues to increase to date. The principle reason for this increase is thought to be the increasing emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) from anthropogenic activities. Although NO(x) is highly reactive and its products such as HN 03 are easily removed by deposition, it now appears that its chemistry is quite complex and it can be transported over long distances via its conversion to a variety of nitrates and penetrates. The sources of atmospheric <b>NO(x)</b> include <b>free</b> tropospheric sources such as lightning and subsonic aircraft, as well as surface emissions which are transported to the free troposphere via convective processes. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have tried to unravel the chemistry of reactive nitrogen species, its sources, and their role in ozone formation. In this presentation we shall describe the results from these studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNOx is {{the major}} {{pollutant}} coming out from diesel engine which needs to be minimized using innovative technologies. It {{has been found that}} SCR system with Urea or NH 3 as a reducing agent is a promising approach to reduce NOx emission {{in order to meet the}} stringent limits on emission standards. In the current work NH 3 flow rate has been varied from 0. 2 kg/hr to 0. 8 kg/hr and injected on to the exhaust gas coming out from the diesel engine, which in turn enters inside SCR catalyst, where it will undergo various reactions to convert <b>NOx</b> into <b>free</b> Nitrogen (N 2). It has been found that 56 % of NOx conversion is achieved with NH 3 flow rate of 0. 6 kg/hr. But for 0. 8 kg/hr NH 3 flow rate, it shows lower conversion, due to desorption of NH 3 from walls of monolith and sintering effect. The simulation work has been carried out using CFD code AVL FIRE for validation purpose. It has been found that the experimental and simulation results are in close agreement with each other...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Lightning is an {{important}} source of <b>NOx</b> in the <b>free</b> troposphere, especially in the tropics, with strong impact on ozone production. However, estimates of lightning NOx (LNOx) production efficiency (LNOx per flash) are still quite uncertain. In this study we present a systematic analysis of NO 2 col-umn densities from SCIAMACHY measurements over active thunderstorms, as detected by the World-Wide Lightning Lo-cation Network (WWLLN), where the WWLLN detection efficiency was estimated using the flash climatology of the satellite lightning sensors LIS/OTD. Only events with high lightning activity are considered, where corrected WWLLN flash rate densities inside the satellite pixel within the last hour are above 1 /km 2 /h. For typical SCIAMACHY ground pixels of 30 × 60 km 2, this threshold corresponds to 180...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Nitric oxide (NO) {{concentrations}} are elevated in sepsis {{and their}} vasodilatory action {{may contribute to}} the development of hyperdynamic circulatory failure. Hydrocortisone infusion has been reported to reduce nitric oxide metabolite (NOx) concentrations and facilitate vasopressor withdrawal in septic shock. Our aim was to determine whether NOx concentrations relate to (i) protocol-driven vasopressor initiation and withdrawal and (ii) plasma cortisol concentrations, from endogenous and exogenous sources. Demonstration of a relation between NOx, cortisol and vasopressor requirement may provide an impetus towards the study of hydrocortisone-mediated NOx suppression as a tool in sepsis management. Design A prospective study of 62 patients with severe sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit. Measurements Plasma <b>NOx,</b> total and <b>free</b> cortisol, and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) concentrations were measured and related to protocol-driven vasopressor use for 7 days following admission. Results Patients who developed septic shock (n = 35) had higher plasma <b>NOx,</b> total and <b>free</b> cortisol, and lower CBG concentrations than the nonseptic shock group (n = 27). Cortisol, CBG and NOx concentrations correlated with illness severity. Free cortisol, and to a lesser extent total cortisol, but not NOx concentrations, predicted septic shock. NOx concentrations were higher in nonsurvivors, and the concentrations were characteristically stable within individuals but marked interindividual differences were only partly accounted for by illness severity or renal dysfunction. NOx concentrations did not correlate with cortisol, did not relate to vasopressor requirement and did not fall after standard dose hydrocortisone, given for clinical indications. Conclusions Nitric oxide production increased with sepsis severity but did not correlate with plasma cortisol or vasopressor requirement. NOx levels were not suppressed reproducibly by hydrocortisone. High interindividual variability of NOx levels suggests that absolute NOx levels may not be a suitable target for individualized hydrocortisone therapy. J. T. Ho, M. J. Chapman, S. O’Connor, S.

40|$|The Caltech {{one-dimensional}} {{photochemical model}} {{is used to}} analyze important questions concerning the upper stratospheric O 3 and the key HO(x), <b>NO(x),</b> and ClO(x) <b>free</b> radicals. The model is described and first order effects of the inclusion of diffuse radiation in a spherical rather than plane parallel atmosphere at solar zenith angles close to 90 deg are assessed. A comparison is made between photochemical theory and observations for upper stratospheric O 3, where local photochemistry rather than dynamics should control the O 3 abundance. The photochemical equilibrium relation for odd oxygen is studied, including the important radicals involves. It is concluded that a significant model ozone deficit exists in the upper stratosphere. Possible causes for such a discrepancy are investigated in light of current model and experimental uncertainties. In particular, the observational ratio of atomic oxygen to zone appears to disagree with the model results...|$|R
40|$|A time-dependent, {{one-dimensional}} {{photochemical model}} of the troposphere is {{used to describe the}} vertical distribution of atmospheric trace constituents for summer-time conditions at midlatitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. The model incorporates a planetary boundary layer (PBL) parametrization and a detailed chemical mechanism that includes the photochemistry of important nonmethane hydrocarbon species formed during the oxidation process. One result of the parametrized PBL is that the concentrations of some trace species in the free troposphere are 20 - 30 percent higher than when mixing processes are described by a vertical eddy diffusion coefficient which is held constant with respect to height and time. The lifetime of the oxides of nitrogen against photochemical conversion to nitric acid during summertime conditions is on the order of six hours. This lifetime is short enough to deplete most of the NO(x) in the PBL so that other reactive nitrogen species are more abundant than <b>NO(x)</b> throughout the <b>free</b> troposphere...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{focus of}} the study is on the sources, {{photochemistry}} and transport of reactive nitrogen species, O 3, as well as other O 3 precursors such as NMHC and CO. Major objectives are: (1) Identify the major sources of NO(x) and quantify the contribution of each source to the NO(x) distribution in the free troposphere, particularly in the upper troposphere. (2) Understand the odd hydrogen photochemistry and the recycling of <b>NO(x)</b> in the <b>free</b> troposphere. (3) Evaluate the photochemical production and destruction of O 3. A combination of modeling and data analysis/interpretation approach is used. We use a three-dimensional model and a box model to simulate, analyze, and interpret the observations. Both models are needed because they are complementary and each has its advantages and limitations. Proven analytical techniques, including correlation of NOx with various tracers and with different air masses, are applied to both observations and model results to deduce useful information toward accomplishing the objectives. In addition, the SONEX observations are compared and analyzed in a systematic way against other airborne experiments conducted over remote atmosphere, especially those from NASA GTE experiments, AASE 1 and 2, and SUCCESS...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{event in}} disease caused by S. pneumoniae is {{adhesion}} of the bacterium to respiratory epithelial cells, mediated by surface expressed molecules including cell-wall proteins. NADH oxidase (<b>NOX),</b> which reduces <b>free</b> oxygen to {{water in the}} cytoplasm, was identified in a non-lectin enriched pneumococcal cell-wall fraction. Recombinant NOX (rNOX) was screened with sera obtained longitudinally from children and demonstrated age-dependent immunogenicity. NOX ablation in S. pneumoniae significantly reduced bacterial adhesion to A 549 epithelial cells in vitro and their virulence in the intranasal or intraperitoneal challenge models in mice, compared to the parental strain. Supplementation of Dnox WU 2 with the nox gene restored its virulence. Saturation of A 549 target cells with rNOX or neutralization of cell-wall residing NOX using anti-rNOX antiserum decreased adhesion to A 549 cells. rNOX-binding phages inhibited bacterial adhesion. Moreover, peptides derived from the human proteins contactin 4, chondroitin 4 sulfotraferase and laminin 5, homologous to the insert peptides in the neutralizing phages, inhibited bacterial adhesion to the A 549 cells. Furthermore, rNOX immunization of mice elicited a protective immune response to intranasal or intraperitoneal S. pneumoniae challenge, whereas pneumococcal virulenc...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} NOx {{budget in}} the upper troposphere over the tropical South Pacific is analyzed using aircraft measurements made at 6 - 12 km altitude in September 1996 during the Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM) Tropics A campaign. Chemical loss and production rates of NOx along the aircraft flight tracks are calculated with a photochemical model constrained by observations. Calculations using a standard chemical mechanism show a large missing source for NOx; chemical loss exceeds chemical production {{by a factor of}} 2. 4 on average. Similar or greater NOx budget imbalances have been reported in analyses of data from previous field studies. Ammonium aerosol concentrations in PEM-Tropics A generally exceeded sulfate on a charge equivalent basis, and relative humidities were low (median 25 % relative to ice). This implies that the aerosol could be dry in which case N 2 O 5 hydrolysis would be suppressed as a sink for NOx. Suppression of N 2 O 5 hydrolysis and adoption of new measurements of the reaction rate constants for NO 2 + OH + M and HNO 3 + OH reduces the median chemical imbalance in the NOx budget for PEM-Tropics A from 2. 4 to 1. 9. The remaining imbalance cannot be easily explained from known chemistry or long-range transport of primary NOx and may imply a major gap in our understanding of the chemical cycling of <b>NOx</b> in the <b>free</b> troposphere.

40|$|We have {{compared}} the 14 -year record of satellite derived tropical tropospheric ozone columns (TTOC) from the NIMBUS- 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) to TTOC calculated by a chemistry-transport model (CTM). An objective measure of error, {{based on the}} zonal distribution of TTOC in the tropics, is applied to perform this comparison systematically. In addition, {{the sensitivity of the}} model to several key processes in the tropics is quantified to select directions for future improvements. The comparison indicates a widespread, systematic (~ 20 %) underestimate of TTOC over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, which maximizes during austral spring. This 'Atlantic mismatch' is largely due to a misrepresentation of seasonally recurring processes in the model, while minor differences between model and observations over the tropical Pacific Ocean are mostly due to uncaptured interannual variability. Although chemical processes determine the TTOC extent, dynamical processes dominate the TTOC distribution, as the use of actual meteorology pertaining to the year of observations always leads to a better agreement with TTOC observations than using a random year or a climatology. The modeled TTOC is remarkably insensitive to many model parameters due to efficient feedbacks in the ozone budget. Nevertheless, the simulations would profit from an improved biomass burning calendar, as well as from an increase in <b>NOx</b> abundances in <b>free</b> tropospheric biomass burning plumes. The use of multi-year satellite derived tropospheric data to systematically test and improve a CTM is a promising new addition to existing methods of model validation, and is a first step to integrate tropospheric satellite observations into global ozone modeling studies...|$|R
