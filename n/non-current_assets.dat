50|$|Deferred charge (or deferral) is {{cost that}} is accounted-for in latter {{accounting}} period for its anticipated future benefit, or {{to comply with}} the requirement of matching costs with revenues. Deferred charges include costs of starting up, obtaining long-term debt, advertising campaigns, etc., and are carried as a <b>non-current</b> <b>asset</b> on the balance sheet pending amortization. Deferred charges often extend over five years or more and occur infrequently unlike prepaid expenses, e.g. insurance, interest, rent. Financial ratios are based on the total assets excluding deferred charges since they have no physical substance (cash realization) and cannot be used in reducing total liabilities.|$|R

50|$|Moreover, a fixed/non-current asset {{can also}} be defined as an asset not {{directly}} sold to a firm's consumers/end-users.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} the problem, which stems from <b>non-current</b> fixed <b>assets</b> affecting profitability and asset management efficiency. Tangible assets, intangible assets and financial assets are all included in <b>non-current</b> fixed <b>assets.</b> The aim of the research is to identify the impact of estimates and valuation in accounting for <b>non-current</b> fixed <b>assets</b> through several objectives, for example, explanation of the impairment tests of tangible and intangible assets under IFRS. This study relied on combining the deductive approach with the quantitative analysis approach, where the deductive approach was used to root the subject through books, periodicals and scientific communications and electronic articles published online. The results of the research: The differences in the measurement of accounting figures under IFRS and EAS may directly affect the numerator of ratio calculations, their denominator, or both. In cases where the difference in measurement affects only the numerator or only the denominator, the effect of the changes is straightforward, easy to identify and to interpret. Identification and interpretation are less obvious in cases of numerous diverging effects on ratios. The results provided by this article have a practical value for designers and users of financial statements. © 2016 Lubyanaya et al...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} accounting harmonisation and determinants explaining accounting measurement policy choice {{decisions by}} Asia-Pacific listed manufacturing companies. Using Thomas' (1991) theoretical framework, four contingent variables (country of reporting, company size, profitability and debt leverage) are examined as possible determinants of firms' accounting choices concerning <b>non-current</b> <b>asset</b> valuation measurement base, goodwill and depreciation. 130 listed manufacturing companies' annual reports were examined from Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. This study involves two phases. The first phase evaluates accounting harmonisation measurement indices {{in comparison with}} the extant literature. An important innovation is the operationalisation of Archer et. al. (1995) between-country and within-country C indices. Computed comparability indices indicated variations in the level of harmony across the five countries for all three accounting measurement practices. The second phase employed logistic regression to examine possible determinants of accounting policy choice decisions. Such a combined research approach should lead {{to a better understanding of}} de facto accounting harmonisation and practices...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of assets and capital structure {{is closely related}} to the company's performance. Good corporate governance can also affect the company's performance. Measurement variable asset structure using the ratio of <b>non-currents</b> <b>assets</b> to total assets (NCATA), capital structure variables measured by the debt ratio (DR), good corporate governance (GCG) is measured by a proxy for the amount of institutional ownership, the number of commissioners, and the amount of the board of directors. The company's performance is measured by the ratio of return on total assets (ROA). The analytical tool used in the analysis is multiple linear regression. The first phase of this article examines the effect of the NCATA and GCG on DR, GCG practices that show no effect, while NCATA positive effect on DR. The second phase of testing GCG and NCATA examine the effect mediated by DR on ROA shows NCATA and DR negative effect, while GCG positive effect on ROA.

50|$|It is {{important}} to differentiate between current and fixed liabilities on financial statements because it allows those using the statements to assess {{the strength of the}} business in both the short-term as well as the long-term, but separately.

40|$|The {{tentative}} decisions under International Accounting Standards Reporting Comprehensive Income (Performance Reporting) (IAS Plus 2004 c) require {{several items}} that are noncore business to be included as comprehensive income. Using data from Australian firms we replicate the IAS adjustments and use linear and non-linear association regressions to test value relevance of these components. Essentially, our study provides a market test of the Maines and McDaniel (2000) hypothesis that the inclusion of noncore operations in comprehensive income may introduce extraneous noise for investors as a single class. We find evidence that the incorporation of revaluations of <b>non-current</b> operating <b>assets</b> and the non-reporting of extraordinary items in comprehensive income significantly reduces value relevance, with net income from ordinary operations the dominant valuation metric. Our {{results are consistent with}} the argument that temporary income and capital adjustment components should be identified and reported separately in flow and stock accounts in order to signal relative importance to investors. We also raise the questions about whether the IAS should uniformly accept the financial concept of capital.

40|$|In {{some of the}} {{continental}} European countries (e. g. France), there is a necessity to make {{a clear distinction between}} the legal issue of commerce fund (fonds de commerce, in French language), and the related accounting concept represented by goodwill. Fonds de commerce represents a set of movable and immovable goods with a common destination, therefore having a unique legal status. Goodwill is an intangible asset item that is placed within the Balance Sheet. It holds together all the fonds de commerce elements which finally form a subset containing the following: (i) intangible assets; (ii) not evaluated, nor separately recorded; (iii) purchased, but not internally created; (iv) which compete for the maintenance and further development of the company’s activity potential. The goodwill issue appears very often within the consolidated accounts. A commercial relationship between the parent of a group and one of its subsidiaries may appear either through {{the creation of a new}} enterprise (initiated by the group leader), or by acquisition of already existent business. In this second case, we are talking about a business combination. The acquired goodwill is mentioned in the Balance Sheet, amongst <b>non-current</b> intangible <b>asset</b> items. The internally generated goodwill is not recognised within the Balance Sheet. Goodwill may be stated as the difference between the acquisition cost and the percentage belonging to the buyer within the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identifiable acquired. In the advanced accounting systems, goodwill is no longer amortized. His useful life is undefined, but not unlimited. The fact that is no longer amortized determines an annual depreciation test. Such a depreciation test is meant to evaluate the goodwill on the basis of present cash flows...|$|R
