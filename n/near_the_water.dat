5|$|Captain Dibble was the Scottish Grand National {{winner in}} 1992 and vied for {{favouritism}} for the Grand National {{until a few}} days before the race. Scudamore had turned down a host of competitors to take the ride in his 13th National, and the pair were sent off at 9/1. Scudamore saw trainer Martin Pipe waving at him <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> jump to stop. The jockey had never won the National in his previous 12 attempts, and retired from racing a short time later.|$|E
5|$|It {{spends a}} great deal of time in or <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> of wide rivers, preferring shallow, clear streams with {{compacted}} and sandy bottoms. The wood turtle can also be found in forests and grasslands, but will rarely be seen more than several hundred meters from flowing water. It is diurnal and is not overtly territorial. It spends the winter in hibernation and the hottest parts of the summer in estivation.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E

5|$|Days {{before the}} {{hurricane}} {{passed to the}} south of the state, high surf from Fico caused some beach flooding in the eastern portion of the island of Hawaii. High surf later resulted in considerable damage to roads and beachfront houses along the Big Island shores. The waves destroyed a home in Puna and wrecked a beach pavilion in Kau. The mayors of three Hawaiian cities issued a disaster declaration for their cities following the damage from Fico. In Maui, moderate waves led to road flooding <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> though no damage occurred on the island. 60mph (95km/h) winds throughout Hawaii downed trees, resulting in some power outages. Damage from the hurricane totaled $200,000 (1978USD, $619,000 2006USD).|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant on or <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping {{the surface of the}} water repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E
5|$|Kidnapping is also {{a common}} theme in such folklore. Encantados {{are said to be}} fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, {{children}} born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among {{people who live in the}} Amazon river area that both children and adults are terrified of going <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> between dusk and dawn, or entering water-bodies alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, although in fact, the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} {{cinematic}} black bars expanding {{to reveal the}} scenery, which {{is set in a}} beach. Individual takes of the girls are shown momentarily as Dinah sings the chorus. The camera shifts to Fetty Wap, who is sitting down in a chair with a guitar next to him. As he sings, the girls are seen dancing in the water, with Lauren kicking the water as the video goes into a slow-motion take for less than a second. Several of the scenes include Normani alone in a rock cliff, a close-up of Dinah singing and a shot of the girls together <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle is an {{opportunistic}} carnivore and consumes a {{wide variety}} of animal prey, including carrion. It often catches a fish by flying low over the water and grasping it in its talons. It prepares for the strike by holding its feet far forward (almost under its chin) and then strikes backwards while simultaneously beating its wings to lift upwards. Generally only one foot is used to seize prey. The white-bellied sea eagle may also dive at a 45 degree angle from its perch and briefly submerge to catch fish <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface. While hunting over water on sunny days, it often flies directly into the sun or at right angles to it, seemingly to avoid casting shadows over the water and hence alerting potential prey.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Martill {{suggested}} that the odontoid {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw of Istiodactylus served to fill the space where no tooth was present. This completed an arc-like bite that would have been necessary to sever morsels that would otherwise remain attached by a thread. Martill stated that few other animals are known with teeth similar to those of Istiodactylus, but pointed out the similarity to various types of sharks and reptiles, including the cookiecutter shark, which takes circular bites from fish as well as prey much larger than itself (including whales). Istiodactylus may also have taken circular bites from prey larger than itself (such as dinosaurs and crocodiles), but perhaps also from fish, for example by snapping at their backs <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface. Martill stated that there were many differences between the skull of Istiodactylus and extant scavengers, such as the lack of a sharp, pointed beak, which could have made it less capable of tearing flesh, but the long neck may have provided enough pulling power, and the claws on the fingers may have been used to manipulate carcasses. Martill agreed that Istiodactylus was most likely a scavenger that would have used its robust teeth to scrape meat from bones, as indicated by wear-facets on the tooth-tips (he proposed that scratch-marks should be looked for on dinosaur bones). He also {{suggested that}} if they were scraping away the last flesh from a carcass, like marabou storks, they would have been in the back of the queue for access to it.|$|E

25|$|Some {{species may}} hold an air bubble within the mouth during ASR.

25|$|Kirk {{realized}} that if a town were built <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{it would be a}} virtual freshwater port to the sea, as well as help support any prospective mill.

25|$|The {{winter of}} 1890â€“1891 was mild, so Murtaja could not {{demonstrate}} her icebreaking capabilities to their full extent. However, she lost {{a large number}} of cast iron propeller blades and while the replacement blades could be installed at sea by trimming the vessel so that the propeller shaft was <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface, the heavy task took several days. For this reason the Helsinki Polytechnics later developed more durable steel blades that were also used in the subsequent icebreakers.|$|E
