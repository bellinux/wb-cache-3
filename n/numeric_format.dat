25|$|Even before 1 January 2000 arrived, {{there were}} also some worries about 9 September 1999 (albeit less than those {{generated}} by Y2K). Because this date could also be written in the <b>numeric</b> <b>format</b> 9/9/99, it could have conflicted with the date value 9999, frequently used to specify an unknown date. It was thus possible that database programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. Data entry operators commonly entered 9999 into required fields for an unknown future date, (e.g., a termination date for cable television or telephone service), in order to process computer forms using CICS software. Somewhat similar to this is the end-of-file code 9999, used in older programming languages. While fears arose that some programs might unexpectedly terminate on that date, the bug {{was more likely to}} confuse computer operators than machines.|$|E

50|$|An {{aircraft}} held on {{the ground}} incurs costs, consequently airlines plan operations to minimise ground time. It is common practice for airlines and aircraft ground handling to have contracts based on a bonus-malus system, penalising the causative agent for delays caused. Delay code properties cover nine category sets for delay. Each category set can be described using either a two digit number code or a two letter alpha code; most airlines use the <b>numeric</b> <b>format</b> but some prefer the alpha. Many airlines further subdivide the IATA codes with an additional character, for more granular delay analysis, {{but these are not}} standardized.|$|E

While extremely fast, it did not emulate the 6502 at full speed so assembly code would run slower than a real BBC while BASIC programs would run much faster. Due {{to the way the}} optimised BASIC and the 6502 emulation interacted, almost no commercial games would run (but well behaved code and educational software generally worked); additionally it used a slightly less precise floating-point <b>numeric</b> <b>format.</b> For a while it was bundled with a special academic package of the Amiga 500, in the hope that schools would replace their ageing BBC Bs with Amiga 500s.|$|E

50|$|GDSII {{had been}} created in the 1970s when {{integrated}} circuit designs had {{a few hundred thousand}} geometric shapes, properties and placements to manage. Today, there can be billions of shapes, properties and placements to manage. OASIS creators and users have claimed what the growth of workstations data storage and handling capabilities was far outpaced by the growth of Integrated Circuit layout complexity. Therefore, OASIS tries to solve the purported problem of the large size of the GDSII files by introducing a complicated types of the geometric shapes (25 types of trapezoids only) to reduce the data size. Also, variable-length <b>numeric</b> <b>format</b> (similar to Run-length encoding) for coordinates was implemented. Finally, each cell in the OASIS file can be independently compressed by the gzip-like algorithm.|$|E
50|$|Gal's {{idea is to}} not precompute {{equally spaced}} values, but rather to perturb the points x so that both x and f(x) are very nearly exactly representable in the chosen <b>numeric</b> <b>format.</b> By searching {{approximately}} 1000 values {{on either side of}} the desired value x, a value can be found such that f(x) can be represented with less than ±1/2000 bit of rounding error. If the correction is also computed to ±1/2000 bit of accuracy (which does not require extra floating-point precision as long as the correction is less than 1/2000 the magnitude of the stored value f(x), and the computed correction is more than ±1/1000 of a bit away from exactly half a bit (the difficult rounding case), then it is known whether the exact function value should be rounded up or down.|$|E

According to uniform standard, primary hydrogeological materials were converted into <b>numeric</b> <b>format</b> to form spatial data base by means of MAPGIS as the flat roof. Digital hydrogeological map spatial data base will be important materials for establishing the model of database and spatial analysis. In this paper, the process of establishing digital hydrogeological map spatial data base was discussed at length. Firstly, the model of database was constructed. Secondly, the vector basic data was inputted, the graphic elements (such as points, lines, and so on.) were edited, errors were corrected, and the layer file was established. In the end, the attributes were connected, the projection conversion was carried, and <b>numeric</b> <b>format</b> were converted in order to forming Arc/Info and Arcview format. So the digital hydrogeological map spatial database was established. The important basic data for spatial analysis and all-purpose development can be obtained from this database. Technological puzzles that came forth frequently in the work were put forward and their resolvents were gave accordingly. 1...|$|E

40|$|Our {{comparative}} studies investigate {{the influence of}} different representations (i. e. formulas or graphical models and <b>numeric</b> <b>formats)</b> on the understanding of ”big ideas ” in stochastics (e. g. characteristics of probability, conditional probability, distribution, significance). We know from previous work (e. g. Sedlmeier & Gigerenzer, 2001) that special tree-representations combined with frequency-formats increase the performance in understanding dramatically. Another aspect of the experiments is the utility of different presenting-modes (e. g. static vs. dynamic, imitation vs. learning by doing). The pupils of age 15 - 19 receive a computer-based training with different representations resp. modes on basic probability tasks. The effects of the training are measured by subsequent tests. Thus we obtain insight, if they succeed easily in using the learned representations and if they benefit from it. The first results support the assumption that groups of pupils trained with frequency-representations {{have a better understanding}} of key-problems in stochastics...|$|R

Users can specify <b>numeric</b> <b>formats,</b> font sizes, and font types at the table cell level, as well as lines in the table and row spacing.
