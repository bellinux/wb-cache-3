25|$|The Steller {{sea lion}} (Eumetopias jubatus) {{also known as}} the {{northern}} sea lion and Steller's sea lion, is a <b>near</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>species</b> of sea lions in the northern Pacific. It is the sole member of the genus Eumetopias and the largest of the eared seals (Otariidae). Among pinnipeds, it is inferior in size only to the walrus and the two elephant seals. The species is named for the naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller, who first described them in 1741. The Steller sea lion has attracted considerable attention in recent decades due to significant, unexplained declines in their numbers over a large portion of their range in Alaska.|$|E
500|$|The {{tiger shark}} is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter.

It also has a reputation as a [...] "garbage eater", consuming a variety of inedible, man-made objects that linger in its stomach. [...] Though apex predators, tiger sharks are sometimes taken by groups of killer whales. It is considered a <b>near</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>species</b> due to finning and fishing by humans.|$|E

500|$|Since 1996, it {{has been}} rated as a <b>near</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>species</b> on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is {{because it has a}} {{restricted}} area of occupancy; although it is a widespread species and has been reported as commonly found within its distribution. Additionally, its population trends, declining about 30%, warrants it a near threatened status, nearly meeting the criteria to be rated as vulnerable. It is hunted as a game species and, between 1958 and 1981, annually about 10,000 furs were produced from the Yarkand hare. Human activities such as transportation development and petroleum exploration has led to the population decline of the species. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed it as near threatened, and earlier it had been regionally listed as vulnerable. It occurs in the Aerjinshan, Luobupoyeluotuo, and Talimuhuyanglin Nature Reserves. As the IUCN report notes: [...] "However, increased human activity within its range is undoubtedly impacting this species negatively. At present, there are no data available to quantify ongoing population decline. It is assumed that declines are moderate (approximately 30%) and is therefore, listed as Near Threatened nearly qualifying for listing as Vulnerable (VU) under A2cd. The species occurs only in the widely spaced oases that surround the Tarim – making it highly fragmented; the majority of the desert has no water or vegetation. More data are needed on the actual population level of L. yarkandensis in the oases that define its AOO, as well as whether or not the species is currently poached for food or pelts." [...] Altnough it was regiinally [...] "classified as VU under criteria A1cd (Wang and Xie 2004)" [...] a better criterion A2 was preferrred, as the cause(s) of decline have not ceased and are expected to continue in the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{greater rhea}} is {{considered}} a <b>Near</b> <b>Threatened</b> <b>species</b> according to the IUCN, {{and they have a}} decreasing range of about [...] The species is believed to be declining due to increased hunting and the conversion of central South American grasslands to farmland and ranchland. The populations of Argentina and Uruguay are most seriously affected by the decline.|$|E
2500|$|The Weeping Paperbark (Melaleuca leucadendron) and the White Samet (Melaleuca cajuputi) species {{bordering}} {{both ends}} of the reserve represent the largest Melaleuca habitat in Thailand. These flood tolerant trees provide protective breeding grounds throughout the year for common native waterbird species such as the Little Cormorant (Phalocrocorax niger) and Purple Heron (Ardea purpurea), as well as other common avian species with annual breeding cycles including the Little Egret (Egretta garzetta), the Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) and the Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis). The thick foliage of the Melaleuca forests also provides night roosting areas for migratory bird species from April to July, such as the Black-headed Ibis (Threskiornis melanocephalus), an IUCN <b>Near</b> <b>Threatened</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
40|$|Agricultural landscapes {{have been}} debated over {{their ability to}} provide {{habitats}} to avian <b>species,</b> especially <b>threatened</b> ones. A pair of River Lapwing (Vanellus duvaucelii) was spotted in an agriculture dominated landscape of north-east Haryana, India. The presence of this <b>Near</b> <b>Threatened</b> bird <b>species</b> along a river bed in an agricultural belt is indeed a promising sign for avian conservation. However, with the growing threats to river ecosystems, the prime habitats of River Lapwings, future conservation policies {{need to address the}} requirements of this species too...|$|R
50|$|Of the 21 {{albatross}} species recognised by IUCN {{on their}} Red List, 19 are threatened, {{and the other}} two are <b>near</b> <b>threatened.</b> Two <b>species</b> are considered critically endangered: the Amsterdam albatross and the Chatham albatross. One of the main threats is commercial long-line fishing, because the albatrosses and other seabirds which readily feed on offal are attracted to the set bait, become hooked on the lines and drown. An estimated 100,000 albatross per year are killed in this fashion. Unregulated pirate fisheries exacerbate the problem.|$|R
