[...] Sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration, but [...] "to dig for it. ... I decide on [...] before I come {{to the question of}} melody. ... I mark out the metre in dots and dashes, and <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> have quite settled on the rhythm do I proceed to actual notation." [...] Sullivan's text setting, compared with that of his 19th century English predecessors or his European contemporaries, was [...] "vastly more sensitive. ... Sullivan's operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely English text-music synthesis", and, in addition, by adopting a conservative musical style, he was able to achieve [...] "the clarity to match Gilbert's finely honed wit with musical wit of his own." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clarence Hickman {{was born}} on a farm {{established}} by his grandfather Leak on August 16, 1889. The nearest town was Lizton, Indiana to the south. Clarence and his siblings attended the Leak country school until 1898, when the family moved northward to the Job Hadley farm, where the children attended another country school. In both residences, Clarence pursued an interest in archery, playing with bows and arrows made by his father. By his own account, The arrows had heavy heads so {{that we did not}} need feathers to guide the arrow.... We boys shot fish with bows, using umbrella staves as arrows. I well remember that I could not understand why we had to aim under the fish to hit it.
