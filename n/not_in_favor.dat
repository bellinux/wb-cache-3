One time, the two sneaked out from the White House {{and went to a}} party dressed up for the occasion. After flying with Earhart, Roosevelt obtained a student permit but did not further pursue her plans to learn to fly. Franklin was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of his wife becoming a pilot. However, the two friends communicated frequently throughout their lives.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} of contention was the Progress Party's policy on Norwegian {{membership in the}} European Union. Reportedly, Carl I. Hagen wanted to postpone a decision on European Union policy from the national convention to a national board meeting in June. Others were <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of this. In an interview, Hagen stated that political parties should not agitate officially for one opinion or the other. He stated an indifference towards EU membership, and that if accessing the Union, Norway could always use a veto against EU policies when needed. Central board member Terje Sæbø submitted a competing resolution which opposed Norwegian membership.|$|E
5|$|Doge Domenico Contarini (10431071) had a {{relatively}} uneventful reign, healing the rift between the Doge and his subjects and regaining territory {{that had been}} lost in the east to the Kingdom of Croatia in the years following the deposition of Otto Orseolo. However, one fact remained: based on their actions {{in the first half of}} the 11th century, the majority of the people of Venice were clearly <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of having a royal hereditary class. This reality, coupled with the fresh memories of power-hungry Doges, set the stage for Domenico Selvo.|$|E

5|$|With Clayton's aid, Taylor {{chose the}} six {{remaining}} {{members of his}} cabinet. One of the incoming Congress's first actions would be to establish the Department of the Interior, so Taylor would be appointing that department's inaugural secretary. Thomas Ewing, who had previously served as a senator from Ohio and as Secretary of the Treasury under William Henry Harrison, accepted the patronage-rich position of Secretary of the Interior. For the position of Postmaster General, which {{also served as a}} center of patronage, Taylor chose Congressman Jacob Collamer of Vermont. After Horace Binney refused appointment as Secretary of the Treasury, Taylor chose another prominent Philadelphian in William M. Meredith. George W. Crawford a former Governor of Georgia, accepted the position of Secretary of War, while Congressman William B. Preston of Virginia became Secretary of the Navy. Senator Reverdy Johnson of Maryland accepted appointment as Attorney General, and Johnson {{became one of the most}} influential members of Taylor's cabinet. Vice President Fillmore was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> with Taylor, and Fillmore was largely sidelined throughout Taylor's presidency.|$|E
5|$|With the fissure, the Congressional Union began a {{reorganization}} to {{push for}} campaigns against Democratic candidates because they had not supported suffrage {{while they were in}} control of the legislature. Paul established an all-woman advisory council of suffrage workers and prominent women which included Bertha Fowler, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Helen Keller, Belle Case La Follette, May Wright Sewall and educators such as Emma Gillett, Maria Montessori, and Clara Louise Thompson, a Latin Professor at Rockford College, among others, to lend credibility to the new organization. Stevens became the national organizer, charged with organizing women in states in which they were able to vote to use their ballots and oppose any candidate <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of full enfranchisement of women. One of the first places Stevens traveled to was Colorado, where CUWS was successful in attaining commitment from one congressman to support the women's cause. Returning from that success in January 1915, she went to New York City and Newport, Rhode Island to campaign before heading west. She campaigned in Kansas, hoping to secure delegates for a convention planned in San Francisco for September.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{months of the}} Chamorro administration, social {{programs}} including free bus tokens for the education sector, pensions {{for the elderly and}} disabled, child care and child development services, and health care initiatives were cut. By 1991 the austerity measures adopted by Chamorro's administration were leading to massive strikes. Chamorro chose to recognize the workers' right to 25% of the shares of privatized state enterprises despite of the disapproval that generated both at home and abroad. The Sandinistas, who had removed some of the businesses from the private sector during their administration were <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of privatization, but they were in favor of workers sharing in the revenues. The far-right of her own coalition was against making labor compromises of any kind. The US embassy and United States Agency for International Development both voiced displeasure at the concessions and speed with which the economic plan was being implemented. In spite of the other programs implemented, inflation was reduced by the renegotiation of the country's debt (called for by the Lacayo Plan). Through negotiations, Nicaragua was able to obtain a writedown of 75% of their international debt on the condition that they had no arrears. As noted previously, the US assisted Nicaragua in paying off the past-due debt to the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank through bridge loans and negotiating a 95% writedown of debts owed to Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These measures provided the means to end hyperinflation and reopen monetary markets, but they were overshadowed by high unemployment, underemployment and an overall recession. The trade deficit rose and GNP declined, and overall, low wages, reductions of education and health services caused poverty to escalate, and social tensions to rise.|$|E

In November 1991, South Africa played their first international match since their suspension from international cricket in 1970, an ODI at Kolkata's Eden Gardens in front of over 100,000 spectators. This match also marked South Africa's return to international sports ending their sporting boycott.|$|E

25|$|The first honours {{list with}} awards of the Canada Medal {{was to be}} {{released}} on 11 November 1943.

Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> of awarding the medal, so the medal was not awarded. Between its creation and 1966, the Canada Medal was an official decoration of Canada, the first award of merit created for Canadians by the Canadian government but in its history, was never awarded.
