5|$|MacPaint 2.0 was {{released}} on January 11, 1988 by Claris. It added many improvements to the software, including the capability to open and use up to nine documents simultaneously. The original MacPaint operated as a single-document application with a <b>non-movable</b> window. MacPaint 2.0 eliminated this limitation, introducing a fully functioning document window, which could be sized up to 8 x 10". Several other features were introduced, such as a Zoom tool, MagicEraser tool for undo actions and stationary documents. MacPaint 2.0 was developed by David Ramsey, a developer at Claris. MacPaint 2.0 was sold for US$125, with a US$25 upgrade available for existing users of MacPaint. Claris discontinued technical support for the original MacPaint in 1989. Claris stopped selling MacPaint in early 1998 because of diminishing sales. There has been an unofficial update called MacPaint X which is 3.0 beta, mainly for people who wished {{to be able to}} use the program.|$|E

2500|$|Greek {{deportees}} {{were sent}} to live in Greek villages in the inner provinces or, in some case, villages where Armenians were living before being deported. Greek villages evacuated during the war due to military concerns were then resettled with Muslim immigrants and refugees. According to cables sent to the provinces during this time, abandoned movable and <b>non-movable</b> Greek property {{was not to be}} liquidated, as that of the Armenians, but [...] "preserved".|$|E
2500|$|Keels are {{different}} from centreboards {{and other types of}} foils in that keels are made of heavy materials to provide ballast to stabilize the boat. [...] Keels may be fixed, or <b>non-movable,</b> or they may retract to allow sailing in shallower waters. [...] Retracting keels may pivot (a swing keel) or slide upwards to retract, and are usually retracted with a winch due to the weight of the ballast. [...] Since the keel provides far more stability when lowered than when retracted (due to the greater moment arm involved), the amount of sail carried is generally reduced when sailing with the keel retracted.|$|E
2500|$|Chimpanzees in the Nimba Mountains of Guinea, Africa, {{use both}} stone and wooden cleavers, {{as well as}} stone anvils, to chop up and reduce Treculia fruits into smaller {{bite-sized}} portions. These fruits, which can be {{the size of a}} [...] volleyball and weigh up to 8.5kg, are hard and fibrous. But, despite lacking a hard outer shell, they are too large for a chimpanzee to get its jaws around and bite into. Instead, the chimpanzees use a range of tools to chop them into smaller pieces. This is the first account of chimpanzees using a pounding tool technology to break down large food items into bite-sized chunks rather than just extracting it from other unobtainable sources such as baobab nuts. It is also the first time wild chimpanzees have been found to use two distinct types of percussive technology, i.e. movable cleavers against a <b>non-movable</b> anvil, to achieve the same goal. Neighbouring chimpanzees in the nearby region of Seringbara do not process their food in this way, indicating how tool use among apes is culturally learnt.|$|E

50|$|In newborns {{and young}} (especially slender) infants, {{the tip of}} the xiphoid process may be both seen and felt as a lump just below the sternal notch. By age 15 to 29, the xiphoid usually fuses to the body of the sternum with a fibrous joint.

5000|$|A {{surfboard}} lock is {{a device}} or {{a mechanism for}} securing a surfboard to prevent theft or loss. Typically surfboard locks attach to {{some part of the}} surfboard, such as the leash plug or center fin box slot. Alternately, some locking devices clamp or strap around the surfboard. Once the board is secured, the locking device attaches to some hard point like a vehicle or a <b>non-movable</b> object.|$|E
50|$|Essentially, the PPU {{supports}} {{two different}} kinds of drawable objects: movable (sprites) and <b>non-movable</b> (background). Both kinds of objects are composed of tiles, and moreover a sprite and background object can use the same tile. The difference is that a tile used as a sprite can move around, whereas a tile used as a background cannot. There are no collision detection registers for sprites as was common on most game systems of the era.|$|E
50|$|Real - The {{confiscation}} of <b>non-movable</b> property (such as land) and the {{movable property}} found on it. Every debitum fundi (a debt using land as collateral) is {{a foundation for}} real poinding. It cannot be used against movable property brought onto the land by a stranger, nor against the movable property of a tenant for more than {{the value of the}} tenant's term rent. A relatively high level of diligence is necessary to accomplish this.|$|E
50|$|They {{can also}} be <b>non-movable</b> and mounted in the door itself because that section of the rear side glass {{would not be able}} to slide down because of the cut-out in the rear doors {{required}} to clear the rear wheel housings.

5000|$|Fixed task {{lighting}} {{refers to a}} <b>non-movable</b> light source dedicated to lighting a specific task. In kitchens, a homeowner may install several recessed [...] "can" [...] lights or under cabinet lighting to provide clear lighting onto the counters for cutting and preparing food. Having proper lighting when working with sharp knives is {{a critical component of}} injury prevention. Another form of fixed {{task lighting}} may simply be a table lamp positioned over one's reading chair.|$|E

5000|$|Split {{screen is}} a display {{technique}} in computer graphics {{that consists of}} dividing graphics and/or text into <b>non-movable</b> adjacent parts, typically two or four rectangular areas. This is done {{in order to allow}} the simultaneous presentation of (usually) related graphical and textual information on a computer display. Split screen differs from windowing systems in that the latter allows overlapping and freely movable parts of the screen (the [...] "windows") to present related as well as unrelated application data to the user, while the former conforms more strictly to the description given in the paragraph above.|$|E

The museum contains <b>non-movable</b> furniture which hold a number of household objects, wooden case, wall-closets, as well as chimneys and a well. Near the well is an olive press, wool press and many large ceramic dishes, revealing {{a glimpse of the}} historical domestic culture of Berat's citizens. The ground floor has a hall with a model of a medieval street with traditional shops on both sides. On the second floor is an archive, loom, village sitting room, kitchen and sitting room.|$|E
50|$|Thermal Transfer is {{a popular}} print process {{particularly}} used for the printing of identification labels. It is {{the most widely used}} printing process in the world for the printing of high quality barcodes.The thermal transfer print process utilises three main components: a <b>non-movable</b> print head, a carbon ribbon (the ink) and a substrate to be printed, which would typically be paper, synthetics, card or textile materials. These three components effectively form a sandwich with the ribbon in the middle.A thermally compliant print head, in combination with the electrical properties of the ribbon and the correct rheological properties of the ribbon ink are all essential in producing a high quality printed image.|$|E

50|$|The movable {{portion of}} the dam is 1066 ft long and {{consists}} of ten tainter gates and three roller gates. The <b>non-movable</b> {{portion of the}} dam continues toward the Iowa shore with a 200 ft storage yard, a 728 ft non-submersible dike, a 1650 ft submersible dike, and a 1315 ft non-submersible dike with two 90 ft transitional sections between the submersible and non-submersible sections. There is also an 8940 ft non-submersible dike on the Illinois side east of the locks. The main lock is 110 ft wide by 600 ft long and like most other sites in the project, it has a smaller, unfinished, auxiliary lock. In 2004, the facility was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as Lock and Dam No. 13 Historic District, #04000173 covering 2542 acre, 1 building, 6 structures, and 4 objects.|$|E
50|$|In sailboats, keels use {{the forward}} {{motion of the}} boat to {{generate}} lift to counteract the leeward force of the wind.

50|$|The bridge's {{name comes}} from a large shoal, or rocky rapids, called the Chain of Rocks, which made that stretch of the Mississippi {{extremely}} dangerous to navigate. Because of a low-water dam built by the Corps of Engineers in the 1960s, little of the Chain of Rocks is visible today except during extreme low water conditions. After 1940, only a single impediment prevented {{the maintenance of a}} safe and reliable 9 ft navigation channel on the Mississippi River from St. Paul, Minnesota, to New Orleans. This impediment, known as the Chain of Rocks Reach, was a 17 mi series of rock ledges that began just north of St. Louis and was extremely difficult and dangerous to navigate. In the late 1940s and early 1950s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built a 8.4 mi canal to bypass this treacherous reach. To ensure adequate depths in the pool below the old Lock and Dam 26, a <b>non-movable,</b> low water dam was constructed just downstream of the old bridge and a lock was installed {{at the south end of}} the canal. Known respectively as Dam No. 27, also called Chain of Rocks Dam, and Locks No. 27, or Chain of Rocks Lock.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} is {{a breakdown of the}} types of evidence encountered and how the evidence should be handled:Fingerprints (also includes palm prints and bare footprints) are the best evidence to place an individual at the scene of a crime. Collecting fingerprints at a crime scene requires very few materials, making it ideal from a cost standpoint. All <b>non-movable</b> items at a crime scene should be processed at the scene using gray powder, black powder, or black magnetic powder. Polaroid 665 black and white film loaded in a Polaroid CU-5 camera with detachable flash should be used to make one-to-one photographs of prints which do not readily lift. All small transportable items should be packaged in paper bags or envelopes and sent to the crime lab for processing. Because of the [...] "package it up and send it to the lab" [...] mentality, some investigators skim over collecting prints at a crime scene. Collecting prints at the crime scene should be every investigator's top priority. Fingerprints from the suspect as well as elimination fingerprints from the victim will also be needed for comparison (the same holds true for palm and bare footprints).Bite marks are found many times in sexual assaults and can be matched back to the individual who did the biting. They should be photographed using an ABFO No. 2 Scale with normal lighting conditions, side lighting, UV light, and alternate light sources. Color slide and print film as well as black and white film should be used. The more photographs under a variety of conditions, the better. Older bitemarks which are no longer visible on the skin may sometimes be visualized and photographed using UV light and alternate light sources. If the bitemark has left an impression then maybe a cast can be made of it. Casts and photographs of the suspect's teeth and maybe the victim's teeth will be needed for comparison. For more information consult a forensic odontologist. Much like a bullet that has individualizing striations on it, natural fingernails have individualizing striations on them. A broken fingernail found at a crime scene can be matched to the individual it came from many months after the crime has been committed. Broken fingernails should be placed in a paper packet which is then placed in a paper envelope. It can then be transported to the crime lab for analysis. Known samples from the suspect and maybe from the victim will be needed for comparison.Handwriting samples can also be matched back to the individual that produced them. Known exemplars of the suspected person's handwriting must be submitted for comparison to the unknown samples. Questioned documents can also be processed for fingerprints. All items should be collected in paper containers. For more information consult a questioned documents examiner.Fracture matches can positively link broken pieces at the scene with pieces found in the possession of a suspect. For example, headlight fragments found at the scene of a hit and run could be positively matched to a broken headlight (just like putting together a jigsaw puzzle) on a suspect's vehicle. Larger fragments should be placed in paper bags or envelopes. Smaller fragments should be placed in a paper packet and then placed in an envelope. If a root sheath is attached, then DNA analysis using PCR technology can say that this hair came from a certain percentage of the population to which the suspect belongs. If there is no root sheath, then a microscopic analysis can say that the hair has the same characteristics as the suspect's hair and is similar to his or her hair. At this point, no one can say that a hair came from a particular individual. Hair found at the scene should be placed in a paper packet and then placed in an envelope. If a microscopic examination is required, then 15-20 representative hairs from the suspect must be submitted to the lab for comparison. If DNA analysis if going to be used, then a whole blood sample from the suspect must be submitted to the lab in a [...] "Vacutainer." [...] Contact a DNA lab for more information.Fibers can be said that they are the same type and color as those found in a suspect's clothes, residence, vehicle, etc. Fibers should be collected in a paper packet and placed in an envelope. Representative fibers should be collected from a suspect and submitted to the lab for comparison.Paint can be said that it is the same type and color as paint found in the possession of a suspect. Paint fragments should be collected in a paper packet and placed in an envelope. Representative paint chips or samples should be collected from the suspect and submitted to the lab for comparison. Glass can be said that it has the same characteristics as glass found in the possession of a suspect. Smaller glass fragments should be placed in a paper packet and then in an envelope. Larger pieces should be wrapped securely in paper or cardboard and then placed in a padded cardboard box to prevent further breakage. Representative samples from the suspect should be submitted to the lab for comparison.|$|E
