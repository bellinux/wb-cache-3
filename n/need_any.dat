5|$|Several hundred frog {{species in}} {{adaptive}} radiations (e.g., Eleutherodactylus, the Pacific Platymantis, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, {{and many other}} tropical frogs), however, do not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> water for breeding in the wild. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the tadpole stage within the egg. Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent {{not only on the}} quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.|$|E
5|$|The one reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on August 30, 1910. The film saw a wide national release, with advertisements in Kansas, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Nebraska, Arizona, and Oklahoma. The film was also shown by the Province Theatre in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Though it had been released years prior to its examination by the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors of Moving Pictures, the film was approved without <b>need</b> <b>any</b> modifications or censoring.|$|E
5|$|To ease her heartbreak and the {{rejection}} from her family, Silk turns to alcohol and chain smoking. She gains weight, {{causing her to}} lose her status as a sex symbol. Silk approaches Silva Ganesh with an offer to produce a film together. Ultimately, the audience and industry has lost interest in her, and the film fails. On the other hand, Abraham directs a film which {{turns out to be a}} huge hit, and he feels that he has finally proven to Silk (and himself) that his films do not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> sexualisation to be successful. Having lost her fame and fortune, Silk has accumulated so much debt that she approaches a small-time filmmaker, willing to take on any role. She is shocked to find that he wants her to do a pornographic film, and she refuses. He intoxicates her with alcohol and starts filming, without her permission. The place is raided by the police but Silk manages to escape.|$|E

25|$|More {{efficient}} amplifiers run cooler, {{and often}} do not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> cooling fans even in multi-kilowatt designs. The {{reason for this is}} that the loss of efficiency produces heat as a by-product of the energy lost during the conversion of power. In more efficient amplifiers there is less loss of energy so in turn less heat.|$|E
25|$|Of this work, {{the major}} item was the {{modification}} of the wheels. The solution adopted by the National Railway Museum Workshop was to employ a metal fabricator to cut four rings from 40-mm-thick steel plate. These were cut with enough precision not to <b>need</b> <b>any</b> further machining. The rings were then bolted to the existing wheels and were a complete success.|$|E
25|$|Various {{methods are}} used to {{encourage}} the formation of locks such as backcombing, braiding, rolling and the crochet hook method. All of these methods require ongoing work {{to be applied to}} the dread before it becomes neat and tight or mature. However, if the crochet hook method is applied by a skilled hand throughout the length of the dread, then the resulting dreadlocks are instantly tight and will not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> rolling.|$|E

25|$|Water is {{required}} by most tinamou species, with some needing a good source within their home territory. Solitary tinamous can withstand an extended period without water by eating more succulent plants. However, species that live in arid or semi-arid climates rarely <b>need</b> <b>any</b> water additional to that ingested with their diet. When tinamous drink, unlike most other birds, they do so by sucking and swallowing, instead of lifting their heads and letting gravity do the work.|$|E
25|$|Although {{abortion}} was illegal, it was nevertheless {{the most widespread}} form of birth control in use. Used predominantly by working-class women, the procedure was used {{not only as a}} means of terminating pregnancy, but also to prevent poverty and unemployment. Those who transported contraceptives could be legally punished. Contraceptives became more expensive over time and had a high failure rate. Unlike contraceptives, abortion did not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> prior planning and was less expensive. Newspaper advertisements were used to promote and sell abortifacients indirectly.|$|E

It was also noted that one cannot pursue two different faculties at a same time since Hussain claim to have both his MBBS degree in 1995 and BA in Islamic Studies from Trinity College in 1995.|$|E
25|$|These {{semiconductor}} radiation detectors need {{efficient and}} uniform charge collection and low leakage current. They are often cooled by liquid nitrogen. For longer-range (about a centimetre) particles, {{they need a}} very large depletion depth and large area. For short-range particles, they <b>need</b> <b>any</b> contact or un-depleted semiconductor {{on at least one}} surface to be very thin. The back-bias voltages are near breakdown (around a thousand volts per centimetre). Germanium and silicon are common materials. Some of these detectors sense position as well as energy.|$|E
25|$|She then {{studied at}} Liqing middle school. However, her mother {{still did not}} change her mind---she did not allow Lanying to study in middle school. She said that middle school was {{provided}} for males, and as a female, literacy did not matter. Lanying fought {{with her mother and}} finally compromised that if she did not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> money to study, her mother would accept. This middle school provided the scholarship for students who got the three best grades in each semester. Because of this, Lanying Lin got the scholarship every semester and finished her studies successfully.|$|E

25|$|For {{years the}} band consented to very few {{interviews}} and have only {{made a few}} music videos, citing {{the fact that it}} does not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> more exposure and that people were exploiting the group. In recent years, Fat Mike has consented to more interviews, including six different interviews with Nardwuar between 2002 and 2011. The band has also refused permission for its music videos to be broadcast on MTV, VH1, and similar music channels, although its music has been played on Canada's Much Music. NOFX made a live appearance on NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Women who miscarry {{early in}} their {{pregnancy}} usually do not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> subsequent medical treatment. They can benefit from support and counselling. Most early miscarriages will complete on their own; in other cases, medication treatment or aspiration of the products of conception {{can be used to}} remove remaining tissue. While bed rest has been advocated to prevent miscarriage, this has not been found to be of benefit. Those who are or who have experienced an abortion benefit from the use of careful medical language. Significant distress can often be managed by the ability of the clinician to clearly explain terms without suggesting that the woman or couple are somehow to blame.|$|E
25|$|Call features: The {{ability of}} the issuer (on some bonds) to call a bond early for redemption. This should not {{be mistaken for a}} call option. A Softcall would refer to a call feature where the issuer can only call under certain circumstances, {{typically}} based on the underlying stock price performance (e.g. current stock price is above 130% of the conversion price for 20 days out of 30 days). A Hardcall feature would not <b>need</b> <b>any</b> specific conditions beyond a date: that case the issuer would be able to recall a portion or the totally of the issuance at the Call price (typically par) after a specific date.|$|E
