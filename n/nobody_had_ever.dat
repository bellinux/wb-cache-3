25|$|After {{arriving}} on Mars in the Meridian Bay, Ghost informs the Guardian of its inhabitants. The Cabal {{have been trying}} to break the encryption on the Vex Gate with only limited success, but they do control many of the places that the Guardian needs to visit on Mars thanks to their Exclusion Zone, which <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> penetrated. The player's Guardian becomes the first to penetrate the Exclusion Zone and heads to the Garden's Spire, which charges the Gate Lord's eye. They also travel to the Buried City, the birthplace of many technological wonders where they discover an AI that used to be linked to the Warmind of Mars, but is now controlled by Rasputin. With the Vex now present on Mars, the Guardian finds out what they are doing; they are returning to their home, the Black Garden.|$|E

500|$|In September 1973, Maryland All-American guard Paul Vellano, then playing under Claiborne, said of {{the past}} coaches' difficulties: [...] "A lot of the kids said that Ward was a good coach {{but that he had}} a lot of bad apples. Lester was a high school coach and <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard of him. I can't {{understand}} it. We had nine freshman who were All-Americans my first year here under Lester. Maybe if they had let him stay he could have done the job.|$|E
40|$|How is it {{possible}} to justify a lengthy review of the physics of the magnetic monopole when <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> seen one? In spite of the unfortunate lack of favorable experimental evidence, there are sound theoretical reasons for believing that the magnetic monopole must exist. The case for its existence is surely as strong as the case for any other undiscovered particle. Moreover, as of this writing (early 1984), it is not certain that <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> seen one. What seems certain is that <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> seen two...|$|R

500|$|Plans for {{creating}} Tron: Legacy began to materialize in 2005, when Walt Disney Studios hired screenwriters Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal as writers for the film. The two had recently finished writing {{the script for}} Warrior. According to Variety columnist Michael Fleming, Klugman and Sternthal felt [...] "that the world has caught up to Lisberger's original concept". Klugman said of the precedent film: [...] "It was remembered not only for story, but a visual style that <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> used before. We are contemporizing it, taking ideas that were {{ahead of the curve}} and applying them to the present, and we feel the film has a chance to resonate to a younger audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Recalling FIG's {{appearance}} at the Total Music Meeting, guitarist Eugene Chadbourne said [...] "The lack of support for FIG must obviously extend {{beyond the boundaries of}} that group into the entire area of women musicians ... I am sure the lack of men on stage made some men feel excluded." [...] Schweizer believed that many male improvisers felt threatened by FIG because of their use of humour, [...] "We were not that serious, like men, ... they take [...] so seriously". Georgie Born described FIG's humour as [...] "very iconoclastic and very surreal, or very silly. There were no big boys there standing judging." [...] On the issue of FIG being a women-only group, Nicols remarked, [...] "It's amazing the number of men that were saying, 'Why are there no men?' And yet <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> dreamed to think of asking why there were men only [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|The map's cartographer, Matteo Ricci, gave a brief {{description}} of the discovery of the Americas.

2500|$|In a European {{interview}} music journalist Chuck Philips {{said that}} what impressed him the most about Shakur {{was that he was}} a poet. Philips said [...] "I like sacred texts, myths, proverbs, and scriptures. [...] When Tupac came along, I thought he was quite the poet [...] It wasn't just how cleverly they rhymed. It wasn't just the rhythm or the cadence. I liked their attitude. It was protest music in a way <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> thought about before. These artists were brave, wise and smart – wickedly smart. Tupac had so many sides. He was unafraid to write about his vulnerabilities." ...|$|E

Lyric collaborator Tony Asher remembers {{that in the}} 1960s: [...] "People would try whatever they could think of that was unexpected, just for its own sake...spend three days and call in a bunch of oboe players. Try an instrument just because <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> used it, and in the end, it wasn't in the final mix. That never happened with Brian. He did {{the same kind of}} experimenting, not {{to see if he could}} accidentally stumble onto something unique, but he did these unique things because that's what he wanted to hear.

2500|$|Three men, David Kiwanuka, Charles Muhaji and Christopher Lubanga {{were arrested}} by the Kenyan police. [...] Kiwanuka was claimed to be Rwandan, despite his {{typically}} Muganda name, while Muhaji and Lubanga were identified as Ugandan. [...] The three had been identified, in what Prunier derides as a story [...] "obviously fed by rather untalented Kigali security operatives", by Kenyan taxi driver Ali Abdul Nasser, who claimed that the three men had tried to hire him as a paid killer because Sendashonga had stolen $54 million in a criminal partnership with Kiwanuka's father, who the Nairobi police {{claimed to have been}} the Director of Immigration Services in Kigali, and who had subsequently been supposedly killed by Sendasonga so he would not have to share the loot. [...] This story ran into serious problems when the actual Director of Immigration Services, a man named Charles Butera, surfaced to state that he was alive, that he had no son named Kiwanuka, that he knew Sendashonga only as a brief acquaintance, and that <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> stolen $54 million.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he won the}} NIT-NACDA Athletic Directors Award, {{he said in his}} speech: [...] "I {{have always}} been a great believer in sports as part of our American way of living[...] [...] [...] [...] I am {{reminded}} of an experience I had of 40 years ago which brought home the real sudden realization of how important we are, and {{how important it is to}} have sports in our American way of life. I mentioned 40 years ago, that would bring us back to March of 1946. At that time I was involved in some high school work in Toledo, Ohio, as a football and a basketball coach. But in order to augment my income, because we weren't getting paid a great deal in those days, I was doing some officiating. I was very fortunate to be chosen by the Big Ten Conference to work the Final Four of the NCAA, which in that year was held in Madison Square Garden. I went a day or two early so I could watch the finals of the NIT Tournament. The two teams were Utah and Kentucky. On the Utah team was a little Japanese-American boy by the name of Walter Misaka. On the Kentucky team was a great basketball player, number one in the country, by the name of Ralph Beard. Misaka was about 5'10" [...] and probably weighed around 160 pounds. Beard was about 6'2" [...] or 6'3" [...] and weighed about 190 He was called 'Mr. Everything' in basketball. <b>Nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard of Walter, but in the man to man defense that the Utah coach, Peterson, used against Kentucky that night, Misaka was chosen to guard Ralph Beard. He held Ralph Beard to 3 points, one basket and one free throw, and as a result of the great work that this little guy did on Ralph Beard, and of course, the work of his teammates, Utah won the game and won the National Invitation Tournament Championship. Just before the end of the ballgame, with just about a minute to play, the Utah coach took Misaka out of the game. About 14,000 people in the Garden that night rose to a person and stood on their feet and cheered the great effort turned out by the little Japanese-American boy. As I reflected on it later, I thought what a great display of how sports are in the American way of life. Remember, I mentioned the date was March, 1946. We had just finished a war with Japan. There were people in the audience who had lost loved ones in the Japanese conflict. There wasn't much love in the heart of any of those people or any American for that matter, for anyone of Japanese ancestry. Yet they could cast aside all of their dislike for the Japanese race and stand on their feet at a sports contest and cheer the efforts of a little Japanese-American boy. Since that time I realize how great our sports program is in America, and how much it means to the American way of life." ...|$|E
