40|$|This {{qualitative}} study>addresses {{the question}} of how Ontario elementary school principals <b>negotiate</b> their varied work roles, through interviews with and observations of 6 principals. Using inductive data analysis, principals' negotiations were divided into 5 categories: <b>negotiating</b> priorities, <b>negotiating</b> the process, <b>negotiating</b> constraints, <b>negotiating</b> the roles of others, and <b>negotiating</b> the self. These principals worked within these categories simultaneously, emphasizing some more than others, dependent on the circumstances. For these principals, the time they spent with people in the school and the resulting relationships that enabled them to build were a first priority, and a large part of how each principal chose to <b>negotiate</b> the demands of their role arose from their personality and their personal values...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{show that}} {{sex differences in}} the propensity to initiate negotiations {{may be explained by}} differential treatment of men and women when they attempt to <b>negotiate.</b> In Experiment 1, participants evaluated candidates who either accepted compensation offers without comment or attempted to <b>negotiate</b> higher compensation. Men only penalized female candidates for attempting to <b>negotiate</b> whereas women penalized both male and female candidates. Perceptions of niceness and demandingness mediated these effects. In Experiment 2, participants adopted candidates’ role in same scenario and assessed whether to accept the compensation offer or attempt to <b>negotiate</b> for more. Women were less likely than men to choose to <b>negotiate</b> when the evaluator was male, but not when the evaluator was female.

40|$|This paper studies {{whether a}} {{government}} party always prefers to <b>negotiate</b> with another compact party {{rather than with}} many different parties in a legislature.

Parties <b>negotiate</b> on both a public (ideological) and a distributive (private) policy. Our main result shows that the government party does not always prefer to <b>negotiate</b> in a bilateral situation. If the level of ideological polarization in the 2 -parties legislature is high enough, it prefers to <b>negotiate</b> with m less polarized parties. We also find that if there are two legislatures with the same number of parties, the government party prefers to <b>negotiate</b> in that with the smallest level of ideological polarization. number of parties, bargaining, legislature...|$|R
