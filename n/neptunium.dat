5|$|Being {{chemically}} stable, <b>neptunium</b> phosphates {{have been}} investigated for potential use in immobilizing nuclear waste. <b>Neptunium</b> pyrophosphate (α-NpP2O7), a green solid, has been produced in the reaction between <b>neptunium</b> dioxide and boron phosphate at 1100°C, though neptunium(IV) phosphate has so far remained elusive. The series of compounds NpM2(PO4)3, where M is an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs), are all known. Some <b>neptunium</b> sulfates have been characterized, both aqueous and solid and at various oxidation states of <b>neptunium</b> (IV through VI have been observed). Additionally, <b>neptunium</b> carbonates {{have been investigated}} to achieve {{a better understanding of}} the behavior of <b>neptunium</b> in geological repositories and the environment, where it may come into contact with carbonate and bicarbonate aqueous solutions and form soluble complexes.|$|E
5|$|Finely divided <b>neptunium</b> metal {{presents}} a fire hazard because <b>neptunium</b> is pyrophoric; small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neptunium</b> {{has five}} ionic {{oxidation}} states ranging from +3 to +7 when forming chemical compounds, {{which can be}} simultaneously observed in solutions. It is the heaviest actinide that can lose all its valence electrons in a stable compound. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 is preferred in solid <b>neptunium</b> compounds. <b>Neptunium</b> metal is very reactive. Ions of <b>neptunium</b> are prone to hydrolysis and formation of coordination compounds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neptunium</b> has valence {{states from}} 3 to 7, {{which can be}} {{simultaneously}} observed in solutions. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 is preferred in solid <b>neptunium</b> compounds. <b>Neptunium</b> metal is very reactive. Ions of <b>neptunium</b> are prone to hydrolysis and formation of coordination compounds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neptunium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Np and atomic number 93. A radioactive actinide metal, <b>neptunium</b> {{is the first}} transuranic element. Its position in the periodic table just after uranium, named after the planet Uranus, led to it being named after Neptune, the next planet beyond Uranus. A <b>neptunium</b> atom has 93 protons and 93 electrons, of which seven are valence electrons. <b>Neptunium</b> metal is silvery and tarnishes when exposed to air. The element occurs in three allotropic forms and it normally exhibits five oxidation states, ranging from +3 to +7. It is radioactive, poisonous, pyrophoric, and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of <b>neptunium</b> dangerous.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neptunium</b> nitride (NpN) {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1953 by reacting <b>neptunium</b> hydride and ammonia gas at around 750°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it {{was produced by}} reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with <b>neptunium</b> metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of <b>neptunium</b> dioxide with diatomic nitrogen gas at 1550°C. NpN is isomorphous with uranium mononitride (UN) and plutonium mononitride (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two <b>neptunium</b> phosphide compounds have been reported, NpP and Np3P4. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting <b>neptunium</b> metal to a powder and then reacting it with phosphine gas at 350°C. Np3P4 can be created by reacting <b>neptunium</b> metal with red phosphorus at 740°C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away. The compound is non-reactive with water but will react with nitric acid to produce Np(IV) solution.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, <b>neptunium</b> and {{americium}} form {{two basic}} oxides: An2O3 and AnO2. <b>Neptunium</b> trioxide is unstable; thus, only Np3O8 {{could be obtained}} so far. However, the oxides of plutonium and <b>neptunium</b> with the chemical formula AnO2 and An2O3 are well characterized.|$|E
5|$|Three {{anhydrous}} <b>neptunium</b> oxides {{have been}} reported, NpO2, Np2O5, and Np5O8, though {{some studies have}} stated that only the first two of these exist, suggesting that claims of Np5O8 are actually the result of mistaken analysis of Np2O5. However, as {{the full extent of}} the reactions that occur between <b>neptunium</b> and oxygen has yet to be researched, it is not certain which of these claims is accurate. Although <b>neptunium</b> oxides have not been produced with <b>neptunium</b> in oxidation states as high as those possible with the adjacent actinide uranium, <b>neptunium</b> oxides are more stable at lower oxidation states. This behavior is illustrated by the fact that NpO2 can be produced by simply burning <b>neptunium</b> salts of oxyacids in air.|$|E
5|$|Two <b>neptunium</b> chlorides, NpCl3 and NpCl4, {{have been}} characterized. Although several {{attempts}} to create NpCl5 have been made, {{they have not}} been successful. NpCl3 is created by reducing <b>neptunium</b> dioxide with hydrogen and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and NpCl4 by reacting a <b>neptunium</b> oxide with CCl4 at around 500°C. Other <b>neptunium</b> chloride compounds have also been reported, including NpOCl2, Cs2NpCl6, Cs3NpO2Cl4, and Cs2NaNpCl6. <b>Neptunium</b> bromides NpBr3 and NpBr4 have also been created; the latter by reacting aluminium bromide with NpO2 at 350°C and the former in an almost identical procedure but with zinc present. The <b>neptunium</b> iodide NpI3 has also been prepared by the same method as NpBr3.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{additional}} alkali and alkaline <b>neptunium</b> oxide compounds such as Cs4Np5O17 and Cs2Np3O10 have been characterized with various production methods. <b>Neptunium</b> has also been observed to form ternary oxides with many additional elements in groups 3 through 7, although these compounds are much less well studied.|$|E
5|$|Heavier {{isotopes}} of <b>neptunium</b> decay quickly, {{and lighter}} isotopes of <b>neptunium</b> cannot {{be produced by}} neutron capture, so chemical separation of <b>neptunium</b> from cooled spent nuclear fuel gives nearly pure 237Np. The short-lived heavier isotopes 238Np and 239Np, useful as radioactive tracers, are produced through neutron irradiation of 237Np and 238U respectively, while the longer-lived lighter isotopes 235Np and 236Np are produced through irradiation of 235U with protons and deuterons in a cyclotron.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neptunium</b> is a hard, silvery, ductile, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide uranium, to the left of the actinide plutonium and below the lanthanide promethium. <b>Neptunium</b> is a hard metal, having a bulk modulus of 118GPa, comparable to that of manganese. <b>Neptunium</b> metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability. When exposed to air at normal temperatures, it forms a thin oxide layer. This reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases. <b>Neptunium</b> has been determined to melt at 639±3°C: this low melting point, a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium (which has melting point 639.4°C), is due to the hybridization of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal. The boiling point of <b>neptunium</b> is not empirically known and the usually given value of 4174°C is extrapolated from the vapor pressure of the element. If accurate, this would give <b>neptunium</b> the largest liquid range of any element (3535K passes between its melting and boiling points).|$|E
5|$|Neptunocene, Np(C8H8)2, was {{synthesized}} in 1970 by reacting neptunium(IV) chloride with K2(C8H8). It is isomorphous to uranocene and plutonocene, {{and they}} behave chemically identically: all three compounds are insensitive to water or dilute bases but {{are sensitive to}} air, reacting quickly to form oxides, and are only slightly soluble in benzene and toluene. Other known <b>neptunium</b> cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives include Np(RC8H7)2 (R = ethanol, butanol) and KNp(C8H8)·2THF, which is isostructural to the corresponding plutonium compound. In addition, <b>neptunium</b> hydrocarbyls have been prepared, and solvated triiodide complexes of <b>neptunium</b> are a precursor to many organoneptunium and inorganic <b>neptunium</b> compounds.|$|E
5|$|Recovering uranium and {{plutonium}} from spent {{nuclear fuel}} for reuse {{is one of the}} major processes of the nuclear fuel cycle. As it has a long half-life of just over 2millionyears, the alpha emitter 237Np {{is one of the major}} isotopes of the minor actinides separated from {{spent nuclear fuel}}. Many separation methods have been used to separate out the <b>neptunium,</b> operating on small and large scales. The small-scale purification operations have the goals of preparing pure <b>neptunium</b> as a precursor of metallic <b>neptunium</b> and its compounds, and also to isolate and preconcentrate <b>neptunium</b> in samples for analysis.|$|E
5|$|Although many false {{claims of}} its {{discovery}} were {{made over the}} years, the element was first synthesized by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in 1940. Since then, most <b>neptunium</b> has been and still is produced by neutron irradiation of uranium in nuclear reactors. The vast majority is generated as a by-product in conventional nuclear power reactors. While <b>neptunium</b> itself has no commercial uses at present, it {{is used as a}} precursor for the formation of plutonium-238, used in radioisotope thermal generators to provide electricity for spacecraft. <b>Neptunium</b> has also been used in detectors of high-energy neutrons.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{presence}} of valence 5f electrons, <b>neptunium</b> and its alloys exhibit very interesting magnetic behavior, like many other actinides. These can range from the itinerant band-like character characteristic of the transition metals to the local moment behavior typical of scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides. This stems from 5f-orbital hybridization with the orbitals of the metal ligands, {{and the fact that the}} 5f orbital is relativistically destabilized and extends outwards. For example, pure <b>neptunium</b> is paramagnetic, NpAl3 is ferromagnetic, NpGe3 has no magnetic ordering, and NpSn3 behaves fermionically. Investigations are underway regarding alloys of <b>neptunium</b> with uranium, americium, plutonium, zirconium, and iron, so as to recycle long-lived waste isotopes such as neptunium-237 into shorter-lived isotopes more useful as nuclear fuel.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neptunium</b> accumulates in {{commercial}} household ionization-chamber smoke detectors from decay of the (typically) 0.2 microgram of americium-241 initially present {{as a source}} of ionizing radiation. With a half-life of 432 years, the americium-241 in an ionization smoke detector includes about 3% <b>neptunium</b> after 20 years, and about 15% after 100 years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neptunium</b> {{is found}} {{in at least three}} allotropes. Some claims of a fourth allotrope have been made, but they are so far not proven. This {{multiplicity}} of allotropes is common among the actinides. The crystal structures of <b>neptunium,</b> protactinium, uranium, and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more {{similar to those of the}} 3dtransition metals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neptunium</b> {{reacts with}} {{hydrogen}} {{in a similar}} manner to its neighbor plutonium, forming the hydrides NpH2+x (face-centered cubic) and NpH3 (hexagonal). These are isostructural with the corresponding plutonium hydrides, although unlike PuH2+x, the lattice parameters of NpH2+x become greater as the hydrogen content (x) increases. The hydrides require extreme care in handling as they decompose in a vacuum at 300°C to form finely divided <b>neptunium</b> metal, which is pyrophoric.|$|E
5|$|Since all {{isotopes}} of <b>neptunium</b> have half-lives {{that are}} many times {{shorter than the}} age of the Earth, any primordial <b>neptunium</b> should have decayed by now. After only about 80 million years, the concentration of even the longest lived isotope, 237Np, would have been reduced to less than one-trillionth (10−12) of its original amount; and even if the whole Earth had initially been made of pure 237Np (and ignoring that this would be well over its critical mass of 60kg), 2100 half-lives would have passed since the formation of the Solar System, and thus all of it would have decayed. Thus <b>neptunium</b> is present in nature only in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Three <b>neptunium</b> {{arsenide}} compounds {{have been}} prepared, NpAs, NpAs2, and Np3As4. The first two were first created by heating arsenic and <b>neptunium</b> hydride in a vacuum-sealed tube {{for about a}} week. Later, NpAs was also made by confining <b>neptunium</b> metal and arsenic in a vacuum tube, separating them with a quartz membrane, and heating them to just below neptunium's melting point of 639°C, which is slightly higher than the arsenic's sublimation point of 615°C. Np3As4 is prepared by a similar procedure using iodine as a transporting agent. NpAs2 crystals are brownish gold and Np3As4 is black. The <b>neptunium</b> antimonide compound NpSb was created in 1971 by placing equal quantities of both elements in a vacuum tube, heating them to the melting point of antimony, and then heating it further to 1000°C for sixteen days. This procedure also created trace amounts of an additional antimonide compound Np3Sb4. One neptunium-bismuth compound, NpBi, has also been reported.|$|E
5|$|When {{it is in}} an aqueous solution, <b>neptunium</b> {{can exist}} in any of its five {{possible}} oxidation states (+3 to +7) and each of these show a characteristic color. The stability of each oxidation state {{is strongly dependent on}} various factors, such as the presence of oxidizing or reducing agents, pH of the solution, presence of coordination complex-forming ligands, and even the concentration of <b>neptunium</b> in the solution.|$|E
5|$|Francium-221 has a {{half-life}} of 4.8minutes. It is {{the ninth}} {{product of the}} <b>neptunium</b> decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium-225. Francium-221 then decays into astatine-217 by alpha decay (6.457MeV decay energy).|$|E
5|$|In February 1940, Glenn Seaborg and Edwin McMillan {{produced}} plutonium-239 {{through the}} bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, they observed {{the creation of}} <b>neptunium,</b> element 93, which then underwent beta-decay {{to form a new}} element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Kennedy built a series of detectors and counters to verify the presence of plutonium. He used mica sliced razor thin to produce a window to count alpha particle emissions, and ionization chamber with a magnetic field to separate the beta particles from the <b>neptunium</b> from alpha particles from the plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Most {{methods that}} {{separate}} <b>neptunium</b> ions exploit the differing chemical behaviour of the differing oxidation states of <b>neptunium</b> (from +3 to +6 or sometimes even +7) in solution. Among the methods that are {{or have been}} used are: solvent extraction (using various extractants, usually multidentate β-diketone derivatives, organophosphorus compounds, and amine compounds), chromatography using various ion-exchange or chelating resins, coprecipitation (possible matrices include LaF3, BiPO4, BaSO4, Fe(OH)3, and MnO2), electrodeposition, and biotechnological methods. Currently, commercial reprocessing plants use the Purex process, involving the solvent extraction of uranium and plutonium with tributyl phosphate.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>neptunium</b> (and plutonium) now {{encountered}} in the environment is due to atmospheric nuclear explosions that took place between the detonation of the first atomic bomb in 1945 and the ratification of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. The total amount of <b>neptunium</b> released by these explosions and the few atmospheric tests that {{have been carried out}} since 1963 is estimated to be around 2500kg. The overwhelming majority of this is composed of the long-lived isotopes 236Np and 237Np since even the moderately long-lived 235Np (half-life 396days) would have decayed to less than one-billionth (10−9) its original concentration over the intervening decades. An additional very small amount of <b>neptunium,</b> created by neutron irradiation of natural uranium in nuclear reactor cooling water, is released when the water is discharged into rivers or lakes. The concentration of 237Np in seawater is approximately 6.5×10−5millibecquerels per liter: this concentration is between 0.1% and 1% that of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{research}} into the properties of <b>neptunium</b> since then {{has been focused on}} understanding how to confine it as a portion of nuclear waste. Because it has isotopes with very long half-lives, it is of particular concern in the context of designing confinement facilities that can last for thousands of years. It has found some limited uses as a radioactive tracer and a precursor for various nuclear reactions to produce useful plutonium isotopes. However, most of the <b>neptunium</b> that is produced as a reaction byproduct in nuclear power stations {{is considered to be a}} waste product.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium-237 is {{the most}} mobile {{actinide}} in the deep geological repository environment. This makes it and its predecessors such as americium-241 candidates of interest for destruction by nuclear transmutation. Due to its long half-life, <b>neptunium</b> will become the major contributor of the total radiotoxicity in 10,000 years. As {{it is unclear what}} happens to the containment in that long time span, an extraction of the <b>neptunium</b> would minimize the contamination of the environment if the nuclear waste could be mobilized after several thousand years.|$|E
5|$|The {{half-life}} of the longest-lived isotope of <b>neptunium,</b> 237Np, is negligible {{compared to}} the age of the Earth. Thus <b>neptunium</b> is present in nature in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes. Traces of plutonium in uranium minerals were first found in 1942, and the more systematic results on 239Pu are summarized in the table (no other plutonium isotopes could be detected in those samples). The upper limit of abundance of the longest-living isotope of plutonium, 244Pu, is 3%. Plutonium could not be detected in samples of lunar soil. Owing to its scarcity in nature, most plutonium is produced synthetically.|$|E
5|$|The known {{isotopes}} {{of plutonium}} range in mass number from 228 to 247. The primary decay modes of isotopes with mass numbers {{lower than the}} most stable isotope, plutonium-244, are spontaneous fission and alpha emission, mostly forming uranium (92 protons) and <b>neptunium</b> (93 protons) isotopes as decay products (neglecting {{the wide range of}} daughter nuclei created by fission processes). The primary decay mode for isotopes with mass numbers higher than plutonium-244 is beta emission, mostly forming americium (95 protons) isotopes as decay products. Plutonium-241 is the parent isotope of the <b>neptunium</b> decay series, decaying to americium-241 via beta emission.|$|E
5|$|The <b>neptunium</b> {{carbides}} NpC, Np2C3, and NpC2 (tentative) {{have been}} reported, {{but have not}} characterized in detail despite the high importance and utility of actinide carbides as advanced nuclear reactor fuel. NpC is a non-stoichiometric compound, and could be better labelled as NpCx (0.82 ≤ x ≤ 0.96). It may {{be obtained from the}} reaction of <b>neptunium</b> hydride with graphite at 1400°C or by heating the constituent elements together in an electric arc furnace using a tungsten electrode. It reacts with excess carbon to form pure Np2C3. NpC2 is formed from heating NpO2 in a graphite crucible at 2660–2800°C.|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, <b>neptunium</b> and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, <b>neptunium</b> and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E
5|$|Edwin Mattison McMillan (September 18, 1907 – September 7, 1991) was an American {{physicist}} and Nobel laureate credited {{with being the}} first-ever to produce a transuranium element, <b>neptunium.</b> For this, he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Glenn Seaborg in 1951.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neptunium</b> (named for {{the planet}} Neptune, the next planet out from Uranus, after which uranium was named) was {{discovered}} by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson in 1940 in Berkeley, California. They produced the 239Np isotope (half-life = 2.4 days) by bombarding uranium with slow neutrons. It was the first transuranium element produced synthetically.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neptunium</b> {{does not}} have a {{biological}} role, as it has a short half-life and occurs only in small traces naturally. Animal tests showed that it is not absorbed via the digestive tract. When injected it concentrates in the bones, from which it is slowly released.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium's unique {{radioactive}} characteristics {{allowed it}} to be traced as it moved through various compounds in chemical reactions, at first {{this was the only}} method available to prove that its chemistry was different from other elements. As the first isotope of <b>neptunium</b> to be discovered has such a short half-life, McMillan and Abelson were unable to prepare a sample that was large enough to perform chemical analysis of the new element using the technology that was then available. However, after the discovery of the long-lived 237Np isotope in 1942 by Glenn Seaborg and Arthur Wahl, forming weighable amounts of <b>neptunium</b> became a realistic endeavor. Its half-life was initially determined to be about 3millionyears (later revised to 2.144millionyears), confirming the predictions of Nishina and Kimura of a very long half-life.|$|E
