2500|$|Under <b>normal</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> {{electrolytic}} capacitors {{can have more}} than a 15-year lifetime, but this can be limited depending on the degradation behavior of the rubber bung (which is not typically aged during lifetime testing). This rating is tested with an accelerated aging test called an [...] "endurance test" [...] according to IEC 60384-4-1 with rated voltage at the upper category temperature.. One of the challenges with this aging test is the time required to extract any meaningful results. In response to demands for long life, high temperature performance from automotive and green energy applications (solar microvinverters, LEDs, wind turbines, etc.), some capacitors require more than a year's worth of testing (10000 hours) before they can be qualified. Due to this limitation, there has been increasing interest in methodologies to accelerate the test in a manner that still produces relevant results.|$|E

The treated animals were then maintained in <b>normal</b> <b>ambient</b> oxygen <b>condition</b> for 3 week and compared to age-matched controls. The IH treated animals exhibited a significantly higher fasting glucose level than the control animals (237. 00 ± 19. 66 mg/dL vs. 167. 25 ± 2. 95 mg/dL; P= 0. 003); and a significantly lower insulin level than the control (807. 0 ± 72. 5 pg/mL vs. 1839. 8 ± 377. 6 pg/mL; P= 0. 023). There {{was no difference in}} the mass or the number of insulin producing beta cells as well as no indicative of inflammatory changes; however, glucose tolerance tests showed a significantly disturbed glucose homeostasis. In addition, the amount of C-peptide secreted from the islets harvested from the IH animals were decreased significantly (from 914 pM in control to 809 pM in IH; P= 0. 0006) as well.

In the mean time different technology demonstrators have been presented by different groups ranging from transistor level to ring oscillators or even digital circuits. However a crucial issue for polymer electronic applications is their reliability. Most prominent reliability limitation is the sensitivity on humidity as the most prominent reason for degradation.

Critical to operation of the Mid-Infrared Instrument is its primary structure, which provides both a stable platform and thermal isolation for the scientific instruments.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of a Mediterranean aquaculture impacted area and control areas {{was made to}} assess the effect of fish farm waste discharge on the biochemical features of the water column. Trophic variables commonly used in marine ecology such as total suspended matter, suspended chlorophyll-a, biochemical features of particulate organic matter (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) and biopolymeric carbon were chosen as the best descriptors of trophic conditions. An initial analysis of data from the impact area {{was carried out in}} order to test the effect of farm waste using a gradient of distances downstream from the fish farm cages (50 m, 300 m, 1000 m). The results were then compared with a control site 750 m upstream. Subsequently, the cage data set was asymmetrically compared with data from five controls collected some years before, when no aquaculture activity was present in the Gulf. The analysis revealed differences in chlorophyll-a, carbohydrates and some trophic ratios between the farm impact area and the controls taken upstream. A clear pattern of trophic enrichment of the water column around the fish farm was evidenced since concentrations in the sites increased along with their distance from the cages. The downstream sites overall were significantly different, trophically speaking, from the five control areas, while the trophic variables of the upstream control were not different from the external controls. Results showed that fish farm facilities provided an organic enrichment of the water column up to at least 1000 m downstream from the cages, producing a deviation of trophodynamics from <b>normal</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|E

Therefore, it {{is in the interest of}} the manufacturer as well as of the occupants to have a fast and accurate method for the detection of substances relevant to this syndrome in order to be able to monitor and control product quality and indoor air quality. The use of small and easy-to-transport ion mobility spectrometers that use UV light as the ionization source enables rapid in situ detection of such substances with high selectivity and sensitivity (detection limits in the lower ppb range). If a multicapillary column is used for preseparation as well, the selectivity is increased and the unwanted influence of humidity on the spectra can be eliminated, thus enabling the use o f the instruments under <b>normal</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions.</b> Furthermore, the use of air as carrier gas avoids the need for other sources of high-purity gas.

Accompanying these developments has come the need for suitable underwater repair and uainten-nce techniques. one such technique {{involves the use of}} fusion welding processes in localised dry high pressure environments created around weldments. Pressure chambers at Cranfield have been employed to simulate this sitiu. ation. These have been used to investigate the influence of ambient pressure (1 to 45 bars) on gas-tungsten arcs. The study has been of a basic nature with emphasis on arc characteristics and arc structure. Special attention is given to the argon TIG arc although helium TIG arcs and constricted argon-tungsten arcs have also been examined. Arc characteristics are reported in terms of arc appearance and modes, electrical characteristics and weld bead studies. The investigation of arc structure is concerned with gaining an understanding of observed characteristics. This has involved experimental and theoretical developments. Experimental techniques used include, electrostatic probes, calorimetry and the measurement of total power radiated from an arc. Models developed here have successfully explained many of the experimental findings and special emphasis has been directed at understanding gas flow in the column and arc stability.

40|$|The <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> such as air quality, noise, music, temperature, {{lighting}} and colour, in open-plan offices {{and their impact}} on employees are important for managements to recognize because open-plan offices {{are becoming more and more}} common in Swedish companies' office design today (Aronsson, 2005). For students, who will soon be entering the work force, it is important to understand how the characteristics of the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> can influence employee behaviour/satisfaction. To have a working knowledge of what kinds of effects the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> can have is likely to increase one's chances of becoming a satisfied employee. An employee that is aware of the importance of creating a servicescape (the attributes of the physical surrounding) that meets its needs and desires is likely to enhance its satisfaction in the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions.</b> A great number of managements may not be aware of the risks of working in an open-plan office where the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> are not satisfying the employees; ergonomic issues as well as heart diseases are the most serious results (Evans and Johnson, 2000, pp. 780 - 782). This leads to the problem formulation of this thesis: "How can management improve employee satisfaction in an open-plan office through the characteristics of a servicescape's ambient conditions?”. Four main theories are included in the Theoretical Framework to provide a deep understanding for the reader about the complexity of problems that comes with working in an open-plan office. The Bitner theory and the research compiled by Sundstrom discuss <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> and their impacts on employees' behaviour/satisfaction. Evans and Johnson’s theory discusses how stress is related to low-intensity noise. The final main theory, Person-Environment Fit, upholds the importance of a servicescape that fits employees’ needs and desires. The <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> influence employee behaviours in numerous ways (Davis, 1984, pp. 271) and at Sogeti’s open-plan office several <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> are studied through an observation conducted during April 17 th 2007 and a questionnaire with 15 closed questions. The outcomes of the observation and the questionnaire are analysed and concrete proposals are created for the Sogeti management to act upon in order to improve the characteristics of their open-plan office’s <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> and thereby improve employee satisfaction. One of the concrete proposals to how Sogeti may improve the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> in their open-plan office is to introduce a survey that should be handed out to the employees three or four times a year. The purpose of the survey is to define employees’ perceptions of the different <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions.</b> Based on the outcomes from the survey, employees’ needs and desires of the servicescape, the ambient conditions’ characteristics, can be improved. Also, some examples of actions geared towards reducing the level of noise in the Sogeti open-plan office are to use ear phones when listening to music and to leave the open-plan office when conducting phone calls. The concrete proposals developed based on the Sogeti employees’ perceptions of the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> in the open-plan office are outcomes of this thesis that may serve as a tool for the Sogeti management to improve the <b>ambient</b> <b>conditions</b> of their servicescape and thereby increase employee satisfaction...|$|R
