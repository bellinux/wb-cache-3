Many biologically and pharmaceutically active <b>natural</b> products contain <b>chlorine</b> and thus, an understanding of the mechanism of its introduction into organic molecules is important. Whilst enzyme-catalyzed chlorination is accomplished with ease, it remains a difficult task for the chemists. Therefore, utilizing enzymes in the synthesis of chlorinated organic compounds is important, and providing atomistic mechanistic insights about the reaction mechanism of tryptophan 7 -halogenase is vital and timely. In this work, we examined a mechanism for the reaction of tryptophan chlorination, performed by tryptophan 7 -halogenase, by calculating potential energy and free energy surfaces using two different Combined Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) methods both employing Density Functional Theory (DFT) for the QM region. Both computational strategies agree on the nature of the rate-limiting step and provided close results for the reaction barriers of the two reaction steps.

40|$|Methyl {{chloride}} (MC) is {{the major}} <b>natural</b> source of <b>chlorine</b> in the stratosphere. The production of MC is dominated by biological sources from the oceans {{but it also has}} smaller anthropogenic sources, such as biomass burning. Production has a seasonal cycle which couples with the shorter lifetime of tropospheric MC to produce nonuniform global mixing. As an absorber of infrared radiation, MC, is of interest for its potential affect on the trospheric energy balance as well as for its chemical interactions. In this study, we estimate the radiative forcing and global warming potential (GWP) of MC. Our calculations use an infrared radiative transfer model based on the correlated k-distribution algorithm for band absorption. A radiative forcing value of 0. 0053 W/m 2 /ppbv was obtained for MC and is approximately linear in the background abundance. The value is about 3 % of the forcing of CFC- 11 and about 300 times the forcing of CO 2. The radiative forcing calculation for MC is used to estimate the GWP of MC. The results give GWPs for MC of about 30 at a time of 20 years. This result indicated that while MC has a GWP similar to methane, the emission rates are too low to meaningfully contribute to atmospheric greenhouse heating effects...|$|R

These suggest a permanent introduction of respective compounds on Earth, long before their anthropogenic manufacture. Microorganisms that are able to grow by the reduction of chlorate and perchlorate are affiliated with phylogenetically diverse lineages, spanning from the Proteobacteria to the Firmicutes and archaeal microorganisms. Microbial reduction of chlorine oxyanions can be found in diverse environments and different environmental conditions (temperature, salinities, pH). It commonly involves the enzymes perchlorate reductase (Pcr) or chlorate reductase (Clr) and chlorite dismutase (Cld). Horizontal gene transfer seems {{to play an important role}} for the acquisition of functional genes. Novel and efficient Clds were isolated from microorganisms incapable of growing on chlorine oxyanions. Archaea seem to use a periplasmic Nar-type reductase (pNar) for perchlorate reduction and lack a functional Cld. Chlorite is possibly eliminated by alternative (abiotic) reactions. This was already demonstrated for Archaeoglobus fulgidus, which uses reduced sulfur compounds to detoxify chlorite.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research program was the behaviour of polar nitrogen compounds in the drinking water treatment process. In addition, studies about the determination of polar nitrogen compounds in surface waters were carried out continuing the research project WT 9356 / 7. The determination of the regarded aliphatic and alicyclic amines, the aliphatic diamines and the ethanolamines as well as N-(phenylsulfonyl) -sarkosin (SPS) and coffeine in surface waters {{was carried out in}} samples mixed over a period of one month as well as sample tests. Based on the determined concentrations and the frequency of their occurrence in the regarded surface waters morpholine, cyclohexylamine, ethanolamine and diethanolamine are to assess as relevant for the drinking water supply from bank filtrates. The technological investigations included the treatment steps microbiological degradation, flocculation, ozonation, disinfection with chlorine and chlorine dioxide as well as the combination of the treatment methods and were carried out using model and natural waters. Resulting from the technological attempts it was shown that expected diethylamine all regarded compounds were removed from the water either by microbiological degradation or by ozonation. In contrast, flocculation and disinfection with chlorine and chlorine dioxide were not suited for the elimination of the polar nitrogen compounds from the water. In further investigations with the alicyclic amines, for exmaple, a correlation between the chemical structure and the microbiological degradation was demonstrated. It was shown after that the reaction mechanism, the chemical structure as well as the degree of protonation of the alicyclic amines influence the reaction-rate of the ozonation.

Initial decontamination effects achieved using EOs were comparable to that observed with chlorine and solution containing oregano recorded a significantly lower initial TVC level than the water treatment on carrots (p < 0. 05). No {{significant differences were found between}} the EO treatments and chlorine considering gas composition, color, texture and water activity of samples. The sensory panel found EO treatments acceptable for carrots throughout storage, while lettuce washed with the EO solutions were rejected for overall appreciation by Day 7. Correlating microbial and sensory changes with volatile emissions identified 12 volatile quality markers. Oregano might be a suitable decontamination alternative to chlorine for RTE carrots, while the identification of volatile quality markers is a useful complement to sensory and microbiological assessments in the monitoring of organoleptic property changes and shelf-life of fresh vegetables. Industrial relevance There is industrial demand for <b>natural</b> alternatives to <b>chlorine,</b> which is commonly used for decontamination of fresh produce but which has limitations with respect to antimicrobial efficacy and possible formation of carcinogenic compounds in water.

The effectiveness of oregano as a decontamination treatment was comparable with that of chlorine. Carrot discs treated with the EO regimes were acceptable in terms of sensory quality and appreciation, therefore oregano could offer a natural alternative for the washing and preservation of fresh produce.

40|$|Chlorine has a {{wide variety}} of {{applications}} in water treatment. Because of its disinfectant efficacy, it is used world wide for the treatment of potable water, sewage, swimming pools and for the control of nuisance organisms in cooling towers. A problem arises when such chlorinated water enters the <b>natural</b> environment, as <b>chlorine's</b> greatest advantage, i. e. its germicidal capacity, becomes its greatest disadvantage. In particular, the discharge of heated, chlorinated water from cooling towers and chlorinated, treated sewage into rivers have severe consequences for the riverine flora and fauna. This study focused on the effects of chlorinated, treated sewage effluent on the community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates in two rivers in KwaZulu-Natal viz. the Umsunduze River in the Pietermaritzburg area, and the Umbilo River in the Durban area. The study was conducted in three phases. The first two phases comprised a toxicological investigation of the effects of chlorine on a selected riverine macroinvertebrate, and the third phase comprised an ecotoxicological investigation of the effects of chlorinated treated sewage on benthic macroinvertebrate community structure. The first phase of the study involved the development of an artificial stream system which would be suitable for determining the response of a selected macroinvertebrate species to chlorine. Chlorine is both reactive and volatile, so this necessitated the development of a specialised flow-through system with apparatus which would allow continuous dosing of a sodium hypochlorite solution. The system was set up at the Process Evaluation Facility at Wiggins Waterworks, Durban, where raw water from lnanda Dam was used. The second phase involved the use of this artificial stream system to conduct acute 96 h toxicity tests. Baetid mayfly nymphs (Baetis harrisoni Barnard) were selected as the test organisms after a preliminary investigation found them to be suitable for survival under laboratory conditions. For comparative purposes, tests were run first on B. harrisoni from a relatively uncontaminated stream in a residential area of Westville, then on specimens from the severely impacted Umbilo River. The LC,O of chlorine for organisms from both sources was found to be in the region of 0. 004 mg/C (free chlorine). This value was well below the general effluent standard of 0. 1 mg/C in effect at the time. The recommended acute environmental guideline is 0. 001 mg/t. The third phase of the study involved field validation of the toxicity test results. It was hypothesised that since the LC so for free chlorine was 0. 004 mg/C, B. harrisoni would not be found downstream from a point source of chlorinated effluent where the concentration offree chlorine ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 2 mg/C, and that the macroinvertebrate community structure would also be altered. In order to test these hypotheses, benthic macro invertebrate community structure was investigated at several sites up- and downstream from the outlets of the Darvill Wastewater Works in the Umsunduze River and the Umbilo Sewage Purification Works in the Umbilo River. In addition, in order to differentiate between the effects of chlorinated and unchlorinated treated sewage, a section of the Umbilo River (upstream from the chlorinated discharge) was exposed to unchlorinated, treated sewage. In this way, a limited "before and after" sewage and an "upstream and downstream" from sewage investigation could be carried out. Organisms were collected from riffles (and from pools in the Umbilo River) and the samples were then sorted and organisms were identified to species level, where possible, otherwise to genus or family. Changes in community composition were shown graphically as pie charts of relative proportions of organisms found at each site, graphs of the average number of taxa at each site; and graphs of the average number of individuals at each site; Data from the Umbilo River were also analysed using TWINSPAN (Two-way indicator species analysis). In both the Umsunduze and the Umbilo rivers, the deleterious effects of the chlorinated effluent were clearly evident. At Umsunduze Site 3 and Umbilo Site 5 (both immediately downstream from the chlorinated effluent) both the number of taxa and number of individuals were substantially reduced, sometimes to zero. Where organisms were found at the next sites downstream (Sites 4 and 6 respectively), the samples were dominated by Chironomus. In contrast, the unchlorinated effluent in the Umbilo River caused very little difference in community structure. As predicted, B. harrisoni was not found in downstream samples in which chlorine was present, yet appeared to be relatively unaffected by the unchlorinated effluent, suggesting that chlorine, rather than the effluent was responsible for its absence at downstream sites. In conclusion, it would appear that while treated sewage effluent certainly causes changes in macroinvertebrate community structure, chlorination of this effluent leads to large scale destruction of the riverine community. This in tum delays the recovery process of the river, rendering a longer stretch unfit for use. The consequences of this delayed recovery are that the failure to meet the water quality requirements of the natural environment results in those of the other water users (agriculture, industry, domestic and recreation) not being met. This reduces the natural capacity of the riverine community to process organic waste and recover from the discharge of sewage effluent. Chlorination increases the distance of impaired water quality and environmental integrity which result from organically enriched treated sewage effluent. The results of the study indicated that the draft water quality guidelines for aquatic ecosystems, derived from inadequate data, and calculated with a safety factor, were the correct order of magnitude. The approach followed in the study will be useful in the development and refinement of water quality guidelines for aquatic ecosystems. ...|$|R

This study investigated CH 3 Cl emissions from leaf litter of twelve halophyte species.

For all species, the CH 3 Cl emission rates increased with temperature following the Arrhenius relation.

40|$|The Great Ships Initiative (GSI) {{provides}} independent, no-cost performance/verification testing {{services to}} developers of ballast water treatment systems (BWTSs) at the bench, land-based and shipboard scales. GSI has the expertise {{and resources to}} perform tests consistent {{with the requirements of}} the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (IMO, 2004) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA’s) Environmental Technology Verification Program’s Generic Protocol (ETV; USEPA, 2010). GSI performs formal verification tests appropriate to market-ready prototype BWTSs, and informal status testing for BWTSs that are still in the research and development stages. GSI procedures, methods, materials and findings are publicly accessible on the GSI website (www. greatshipsinitiative. org). In early 2011, researchers from the National Parks of Lake Superior Foundation (NPLSF) in Marquette, Michigan, and the Michigan Technological University (MTU) in Houghton, Michigan, applied to GSI for land-based tests of a BWTS involving sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), in the same formulation used for household bleach. The BWTS was proposed for emergency treatment of ballast water in tanks of Great Lakes vessels passing through the Welland Canal system of the St. Lawrence Seaway into the upstream lakes. The method involves multiple steps: • Determination of the <b>natural</b> <b>chlorine</b> demand of the ballast water one day ahead of treatment application, i. e., prior to the vessel’s entry into the Canal, for example, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada; • Determination of the necessary volume of 6. 15 % NaOCl solution {{to be added to the}} ballast water to overcome the <b>natural</b> <b>chlorine</b> demand and deliver a predetermined chlorine concentration; • Mixing using a method designed by the researchers; • Retention of the treated ballast water in tank for a predetermined length of time (i. e., exposure period); • Determination of residual chlorine concentration, and determination and application of the amount of a neutralizer necessary to fully neutralize the treated water for safe discharge; and • Verification of complete neutralization prior to the vessel’s departure from the Canal system. Tests took place at GSI’s Land-Based Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation (RDTE) Facility in Superior, Wisconsin, in October 2011, with the goal of status testing for research and development purposes. As such, the testing was based on, though not strictly consistent with, the IMO’s G 8 Guidelines for Approval of Ballast Water Management Systems (IMO, 2008 a), the IMO’s G 9 Guidelines for Approval of Ballast Water Management Systems that make use of Active Substances (IMO, 2008 b) and the USEPA ETV Program’s Generic Protocol for the Verification of Ballast Water Treatment Technology, v. 5. 1 (USEPA, 2010). During the test, GSI implemented the entire proposed NaOCl BWTS method with the exception of the automated mixing system; trialing the mixing apparatus at a land-based facility would offer little insight into its capability on board a ship in any case. GSI evaluated the BWTS for its ability to: • Deliver the target concentration of chlorine (above <b>natural</b> <b>chlorine</b> demand) using a 6. 15 % NaOCl solution, and deliver the target concentration of neutralizer; • Reduce densities of live organisms in intake water from prescribed threshold densities to below densities allowed by the Ballast Water Performance Standard of the IMO Convention (IMO, 2004); and • Result in treatment water safe to discharge in terms of residual chlorine concentration and whole effluent toxicity (WET). Disinfection by products (DBPs) were also measured and reported. The GSI test of the NaOCl BWTS yielded mixed results. In terms of operational performance, GSI was able to accurately dose a sampled volume of water with 6. 15 % NaOCl solution to a predetermined chlorine concentration by factoring in the <b>natural</b> <b>chlorine</b> demand. The neutralization process recommended by the BWTS developer did require additional neutralizer additions, which could be problematic in an actual shipboard situation. More research is needed on the effect of temperature and water quality on the ability of sodium bisulfite (NaHSO 3) or a neutralization substitute to successfully neutralize NaOCl-treated water for BWTS application in the real-world. Second, the BWTS reduced live densities of organisms ≥ 50 μm which were adequately plentiful in the intake to meet IMO testing guidelines, relative to control discharge. But BWTS live discharge densities were well above the IMO benchmark (IMO, 2004). The BWTS did reduce live densities of organisms > 10 and < 50 μm minimum dimension to below benchmark levels within the IMO Convention, but intake densities of these organisms also were below IMO testing guidelines due to the late season timing of the tests (IMO, 2004). Finally, the treated and neutralized discharge water was found to be safe to discharge (though, in some cases only after multiple neutralization steps) and free from toxicity in Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) tests conducted by GSI. Measurable concentrations of DBP were found in the treatment discharge, specifically trihalomethanes (THM) and haloacetic acids (HAA). Overall, the GSI results show that the NaOCl BWTS both warrants and would benefit from further research and development on its potential as an emergency BWTS with relevancy in the Great Lakes...|$|E

CH 3 Br is also an agricultural pesticide whose use is regulated by international agreement [6]. Despite the economic and environmental importance of these methyl halides, their natural sources and biological production mechanisms are poorly understood. Besides CH 3 Br fumigation, important sources include oceans, biomass burning, tropical plants, salt marshes, and certain crops and fungi [7]. Here, we demonstrate that the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana produces and emits methyl halides and that the enzyme primarily responsible for the production is encoded by the HARMLESS TO OZONE LAYER (HOL) gene. The encoded protein belongs {{to a group of}} methyltransferases capable of catalyzing the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) -dependent methylation of chloride (Cl -), bromide (Br -), and iodide (I -) to produce methyl halides [8 - 10].

Sea salt from the ocean surfaces represent the predominant portion of the source of chlorine. It is also an important source of atmospheric fluorine, but volcanoes are likely to be more important fluorine sources. Dry deposition of sea salt returns about 85 percent of the salt released there. Precipitation removes the remainder. Most of the sea salt materials are considered to be cyclic, moving through sea spray over the oceans and either directly back to the oceans or deposited dry and in precipitation on land, whence it runs off into rivers and streams and returns to the oceans. Most of the <b>natural</b> <b>chlorine</b> in the atmosphere is in the form of particulate chloride ion with lesser amounts as gaseous inorganic chloride and methyl chloride vapor. Fluorine is emitted from volcanoes primarily as HF. It is possible that HF may be released directly form the ocean surface but this has not been confirmed by observation. HCl and most likely HF gases are released into the atmosphere by sea salt aerosols. The mechanism for the release is likely to be the provision of protons from the so-called excess sulfate and HNO 3. Sea salt aerosol contains fluorine as F(-), MgF(+), CaF(+), and NaF. The concentrations of the various species of chlorine and fluorine that characterize primarily natural, unpolluted atmospheres are summarized in tables and are discussed in relation to their fluxes through the geochemical cycle...|$|E
40|$|Tomatoes {{can make}} people {{healthier}} and decrease {{the risk of}} conditions such as cancer, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. People who ate tomatoes regularly have a reduced risk of contracting cancer diseases such as lung, prostate, stomach, cervical, breast, oral, colorectal, esophageal, pancreatic, and many other types of cancer. Some studies show that tomatoes and garlic should be taken together {{at the same time}} to have its cancer preventive effects. Whatever it is, we really do not know how or why tomatoes work against cancers. We believe that lycopene and the newly discovered bioflavonoids in tomatoes are responsible as cancer fighting agents. Not only raw tomatoes but also cooked or processed tomato products such as ketchup, sauce, and paste, are counted as good sources of cancer prevention. Tomato is also good for liver health. Tomato has detoxification effect in the body. Probably it is due to the presence of chlorine and sulfur in tomatoes. According to some studies, 51 mg of chlorine and 11 mg of sulfur in 100 grams size of tomato have a vital role in detoxification process. We know that <b>natural</b> <b>chlorine</b> works in stimulating the liver and its function for filtering and detoxifying body wastes. Sulfur in tomatoes protects the liver from cirrhosis, too. Tomato juice is known as good energy drink and for rejuvenating the health of patients on dialysis. Herbalists knew that taking tomatoes and tomato products could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases because of lycopene in it. What is your worry when you take too much food that contains animal fat, Butter, cheese, pork, egg, beef, and other fried foods. Take tomato, it will prevent hardening of the arteries. Therefore, tomato can reduce high blood pressure, too. Red ripened tomato is a powerful antioxidant. Vitamin E and lycopene in tomato prevents LDL oxidation effectively. Bean sprouts, cabbage or barley malt contain vitamin E. Tomato is an excellent fruit or vegetable for rapid skin cell replacement. Tomato juice can be used for healing sunburn because of its unique vitamin C. You can also name tomato juice as a good sports drink to restore yourself from fatigue and sleepiness...|$|E
40|$|Dating the transport/deposition time of supratidal coarse-clast {{deposits}} is difficult, {{limiting their}} value for inferring frequency-magnitude patterns of high-energy wave events. On Bonaire (Leeward Antilles, Caribbean), these deposits form prominent landforms, and transport {{by one or}} several Holocene tsunamis is assumed {{at least for the}} largest clasts. Although a large dataset of 14 C and electron spin resonance (ESR) ages is available for major coral rubble ridges and ramparts, it is still debated whether these data reflect the timing of major events, and how these datasets are biased by the reworking of coral fragments. As an attempt to overcome the current challenges for dating the dislocation of singular boulders, three distinct dating methods are implemented and compared: (i) 14 C dating of boring bivalves attached to the boulders; (ii) 230 Th/U dating of post-depositional, secondary calcite flowstone and subaerial microbialites at the underside of the boulders; and (iii) surface exposure dating of overturned boulders via 36 Cl concentration measurements in corals. Approaches (ii) and (iii) have never been applied to coastal boulder deposits so far. The three 14 C age estimates are older than 40 ka, i. e. most probably beyond the applicability of the method, which is attributed to post-depositional diagenetic processes, shedding doubt on the usefulness of this method in the local context. The remarkably convergent 230 Th/U ages, all pointing to the Late Holocene period (1. 0 – 1. 6 ka), are minimum ages for the transport event(s). The microbialite sample yields an age of 1. 23 ± 0. 23 ka and both flowstone samples are in stratigraphic order: the older (onset of carbonate precipitation) and younger flowstone layers yield ages of 1. 59 ± 0. 03 and 1. 23 ± 0. 03 ka, respectively. Four coral samples collected from the topside of overturned boulders yielded similar 36 Cl concentration measurements. However, the computed ages are affected by large uncertainties, mostly due to the high <b>natural</b> <b>chlorine</b> concentration. After correction for the inherited component and chemical denudation since platform emergence (inducing additional uncertainty), the calculated 36 Cl ages cluster between 2. 5 ± 1. 3 and 3. 0 ± 1. 4 ka for three of four boulders whilst the fourth one yields an age of 6. 1 ± 1. 8 ka, probably related to a higher inheritance. These 230 Th/U and 36 Cl age estimates are coherent with a suggested tsunami age of < 3. 3 ka obtained from the investigation of allochthonous shell horizons in sediment cores of northwestern Bonaire. Whilst 230 Th/U dating of post-depositional calcite flowstone appears to be the most robust and/or accurate approach, these results illustrate the potential and current limitations of the applied methods for dating the dislocation of supralittoral boulders in carbonate-reef settings.
