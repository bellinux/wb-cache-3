25|$|Falcone {{received}} an effusive congratulatory {{phone call from}} Giulio Andreotti after the narrow escape. Falcone privately thought it odd that Andreotti, who he had <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to,</b> would suddenly contact him, and he mused {{about the significance of}} the incident to a friend. Unknown to Falcone the efforts to kill him were suspended while the Maxi trial verdicts went through the appeals process that had often set convicted Mafia members free. Later investigations into the murders of two police officers, Antonino Agostino and Emanuele Piazza, who worked for the secret service, revealed that they had secretly defused the bombs that had been placed by a Mafia commando aided by other secret service men. Agostino and his wife were killed on 5 August 1989 outside their home, and Piazza on 15 March 1990.|$|E

Blanchflower quit the panel and said he would also wind up his review {{of the role of the}} Bank of England on 28 June 2016 following the mass resignations of the Shadow Cabinet, joining them in calling for Corbyn to step down.|$|E

Lucky's owner, Mr. Bernard, and Squash's owner, Miss Violet, are both single and have <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> each other {{because they are so}} shy. Lucky and Squash decide to run away hoping that, when their owners come rescue them, the two owners will meet, fall in love, and get married, thereby making the dogs [...] "brothers" [...] and allowing them to play together whenever they wish. Lucky and Squash escape from their respective yards three days in a row and go on adventures. The owners do meet and fall in love.|$|E

The celebration derives from Nani's {{background}} in capoeira, which he used to practice as a child. For a while, it was reported that United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had banned Nani's celebration due to fear for his safety. Nani denounced the reports in August 2007, stating it was [...] "not true" [...] and that [...] "Ferguson has <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> me about this subject and I am going to continue to celebrate goals in this way. The conversations he has had with me are normal conversations, like he has with all players".|$|E

One friend, Ryan Duffin (called [...] "Randall" [...] in the Rolling Stone article), told The Washington Post that he had <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> any reporter from Rolling Stone, although Erdely had claimed him as a source to corroborate the accuser's story.

500|$|On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf {{released}} his short film Howard Cantour.com to the Internet; shortly thereafter, several bloggers noted its close similarity to Justin M. Damiano, a 2007 comic by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes. Wired journalist Graeme McMillan noted {{at least three}} similarities in their article, {{one of which was}} that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical. LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead [...] "inspired" [...] by him and [...] "got lost in the creative process." [...] He followed this up with several apologies via Twitter writing, [...] "In my excitement and naivet√© as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation", and [...] "I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know that I have a great respect for his work". Clowes responded by saying [...] "The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link. I've <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind." [...] LaBeouf was criticized over his apology, with some sites such as The A.V. Club noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on Yahoo! Answers.|$|E

2500|$|Fitch {{was able}} to damage Ike Clanton's {{credibility}} through skillful questioning. In response to his questioning, Clanton denied seeking confirmation from Wyatt Earp about the reward offered by Wells, Fargo & Co, [...] "dead or alive", for the stage robbers. When shown the telegram confirming the reward would be paid in either circumstance, he denied having ever seen it before. On November 12, he got Clanton to testify that he had <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Ned Boyle {{on the morning of}} the gunfight, and on November 23, Boyle's testimony contradicted Clanton's. During Ike Clanton's testimony under cross-examination by Fitch, he said [...] "I don't remember" [...] 14 times. This and other contradictions impugned Clanton's testimony.|$|E

We are not in anyway 'leaders of' or authorities on the 'Riot Girl' movement. In fact, as individuals we have each had different experiences with, feelings on, opinions of and varying degrees of involvement with 'Riot Girl' and though we totally respect those who still feel that label is important and meaningful to them, we have never used that term to describe ourselves AS A BAND. As individuals we respect and utilize and subscribe to a variety of different aesthetics, strategies, and beliefs, both political and punk-wise, some of which are probably considered 'riot girl.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, Wakefield wrote Callous Disregard: Autism and Vaccines ‚Äì The Truth Behind a Tragedy, {{in which}} he {{rejected}} the charges against him, and claimed {{that the loss of}} his license was a political attempt to silence his criticism of vaccine safety. [...] In 2013, Joel A. Harrison, PhD, MPH published a detailed examination of Callous Disregard, and concluded that [...] "a careful review of publicly available information makes it clear that ... every major claim Wakefield makes in his book concerning vaccine safety is wrong." [...] He demonstrated that in some cases, the references that Wakefield cited to support his claims showed exactly the opposite. [...] For example, Wakefield asserted that Brith Christenson, MD, PhD, a respected Swedish vaccine researcher, had told him that vaccine safety studies had not been carried out in Sweden because Swedish physicians did not concern themselves with vaccine safety; then cited three Swedish papers‚Äîtwo of them co-authored by Christenson‚Äîdetailing multiple vaccine safety studies that had been conducted in Sweden. [...] Christenson later affirmed {{in a letter to the}} editor that she had never said any such thing to anyone, and in fact had <b>never</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Wakefield at all.|$|E
