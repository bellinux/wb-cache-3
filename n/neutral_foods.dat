40|$|This {{study shows}} that tempting food words {{activate}} simulations of eating the food, including simulations of the taste and texture of the food, simulations of eating situations, and simulations of hedonic enjoyment. In a feature listing task, participants generated features that are typically true of four tempting foods (e. g., chips) and four <b>neutral</b> <b>foods</b> (e. g., rice). The resulting features were coded as features of eating simulations if they referred to the taste, texture and temperature of the food (e. g., crunchy; sticky), to situations of eating the food (e. g., movie; good for Wok dishes), and to the hedonic experience when eating the food (e. g., tasty). Based on the grounded cognition perspective, {{it was predicted that}} tempting foods {{are more likely to be}} represented in terms of actually eating them, so that participants would list more features referring to eating simulations for tempting than for <b>neutral</b> <b>foods.</b> Confirming this hypothesis, results showed that eating simulation features constituted 53 % of the features for tempting food, and 26 % of the features for neutral food. Visual features, in contrast, were mentioned more often for <b>neutral</b> <b>foods</b> (45 %) than for tempting foods (19 %). Exploratory analyses revealed that the proportion of eating simulation features for tempting foods was positively correlated with perceived attractiveness of the foods, and negatively with participants’ dieting concerns, suggesting that eating simulations may depend on individuals’ goals with regard to eating. These findings are discussed with regard to their implications for understanding the processes guiding eating behavior, and for interventions designed to reduce the consumption of attractive, unhealthy food...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{showed that}} using mindful attention (observing mental reactions to external stimuli and recognizing them as transient mental events, rather than viewing them as reflections of reality) reduces the spontaneous approach reactions towards attractive food. In {{this article we}} aimed to gain insight in the underlying mechanism. How does the representation of a food object change after paying mindful attention? We assumed that the simulation of eating food provides an answer. We conducted two studies. Study 1 was a pilot study to test {{the usability of an}} alternative property generation task question to use in Study 2. The alternative question appeared less functional than the regular one. In Study 2 participants received a brief mindful attention instruction. They observed their reactions to external stimuli as passing mental events rather than subjectively real experiences. They observed pictures of attractive and <b>neutral</b> <b>food</b> items. Finally, they were asked to report typical features of each food item. Results showed that participants reported more taste and texture features for attractive <b>food</b> compared to <b>neutral</b> <b>food.</b> Participants also reported more taste and texture features for attractive foods when they were relatively hungry, but interestingly this effect was fully eliminated in the mindful attention condition. Mindful attention seems to be a defensive mechanism against attractive food cues for hungry individuals. It reduces the sensitivity towards food temptations.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the effects of mood states, food cue exposure, and individual differences in eating styles, personality and hedonic hunger on implicit eating expectancies and eating-related responses, including the desire to eat and actual food intake. 109 female participants were shown either negative or neutral mood-inducing video clips. This was followed by exposure to either palatable or <b>neutral</b> <b>food</b> images, as well as an implicit measure of eating expectancies. Participants also completed self-report measures of eating styles, both the original and revised Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST), and appetitive drive to consume palatable foods. Desire to eat was measured at three time points (baseline, following the mood manipulation procedure, and following the food cue exposure/implicit eating expectancies measure), while actual food intake was recorded at the final stage of the study. Results revealed that the desire to eat increased following exposure to palatable, but not <b>neutral</b> <b>food</b> cues. The effect of food cue exposure was strongest among participants with an external eating style and those high in hedonic hunger. Reward sensitivity and hedonic hunger were associated with implicit eating expectancies. Eating expectancies also mediated the relationships between reward sensitivity and emotional/external/disinhibited eating. Finally, only the revised Behavioural Inhibition System (r-BIS) was related to food intake, with higher r-BIS scores predicting less food consumption. There was limited support for the influence of negative mood on the desire to eat. These findings highlight the roles of eating styles, reward sensitivity, hedonic hunger and beliefs about eating in contributing to dysfunctional eating.

Food-drug effect clinical studies are rarely carried out in children, despite sometimes having different food-drug effects to adults. The aim was to see which food components affect the absorption of propylthiouracil and penicillin V. Propylthiouracil is best administered to children with more acidic foods, such as apple sauce or fruit juice, while more <b>neutral</b> <b>foods</b> high in fat, calcium and protein, for example milk and yoghurt, should be avoided, due to negative effects on absorption. Conversely, penicillin V should be delivered with <b>neutral</b> <b>foods,</b> but not acidic foods. Project 2 : Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare, aggressive tumour type. Hereditary MTC has recently been associated with inactivating mutations in oestrogen receptor β (ERβ).

The aims were to achieve significant ERβ knockdown, and see whether knockdown affects Ret, cyclin D 1 and IGF- 1 R expression (other oestrogen-responsive genes involved in cell proliferation). RNA levels of Ret and cyclin D 1 were statistically unchanged with significant ERβ knockdown, or oestrogen treatment.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) affects brain responses to palatable foods and whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, an omega- 3 fatty acid that is a primary structural component of the human brain) serum levels moderate the association between IUGR and brain and behavioral responses to palatable foods. Brain responses to palatable foods were investigated using a functional magnetic resonance imaging task in which participants were shown palatable foods, <b>neutral</b> <b>foods</b> and non-food items. Serum DHA was quantified in blood samples, and birth weight ratio (BWR) was used as a proxy for IUGR. The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) was used to evaluate eating behaviors. In the contrast palatable food 4 neutral items, we found an activation in the right superior frontal gyrus with BWR as the most important predictor; the lower the BWR (indicative of IUGR), the greater the activation of this region involved in impulse control/decision making facing the viewing of palatable food pictures versus neutral items. At the behavioral level, a general linear model predicting external eating using the DEBQ showed a significant interaction between DHA and IUGR status; in IUGR individuals, the higher the serum DHA, the lower is external eating. In conclusion, we suggest that IUGR moderates brain responses when facing stimuli related to palatable foods, activating an area related to impulse control. Moreover, higher intake of n- 3 PUFAs can protect IUGR individuals from developing inappropriate eating behaviors, the putative mechanism of protection would involve decreasing intake in response to external food cues in adolescents/young adults...|$|E
40|$|Three studies {{illustrate}} that mindful attention prevents impulses toward attractive food. Participants received a brief mindfulness procedure {{in which they}} observed their reactions to external stimuli as transient mental events rather than subjectively real experiences. Participants then applied this procedure to viewing pictures of highly attractive and <b>neutral</b> <b>food</b> items. Finally, reactions to food stimuli were assessed with an implicit approach-avoidance task. Across experiments, spontaneous approach reactions elicited by attractive food were fully eliminated in the mindful attention condition compared to the control condition, in which participants viewed the same items without mindful attention. These effects were maintained over a 5 -minute distraction period. Our findings suggest that mindful attention to one’s own mental experiences helps to control impulsive responses and thus suggest mindfulness as a potentially powerful method for facilitating self-regulation.

40|$|Dieting is {{difficult}} to maintain {{in an environment where}} cues of attractive, high-calorie food abound. Overweight and restrained eating have been associated with failures of self-regulation in response to such food cues. A subgroup of successful restrained eaters, however, have been found to activate their dieting goal in response to tempting food cues, which helps them to pursue their dieting goal in such situations. The present research extended this finding by examining the effect of tempting food cues on wanting to eat high-calorie snacks in normal-weight and overweight restrained eaters. In an Internet experiment, normal-weight and overweight participants (N =  284) were unobtrusively primed with tempting <b>food</b> or <b>neutral</b> <b>food</b> objects. Next, wanting for high-calorie snacks was assessed with a forced-choice measure presenting pictures of high-calorie snacks and low-calorie alternatives. As predicted, exposure to attractive food cues decreased wanting for high-calorie food in normal-weight restrained eaters, but increased wanting in overweight restrained eaters. These results suggest that, in women who are successful in maintaining their weight, food temptations may trigger processes of successful self-regulation, whereas overweight restrained eaters may seem to forget about their diet goal when they are confronted with attractive food, thereby risking the chance to overeat...|$|R

Experimental data for heat, mass transfers and reactions modeling were from previous studies. The options of the frying were oil type, micronutrient-enrichment or not, thickness of final product, frying temperature and number of baths. Frying turned plantain from <b>neutral</b> <b>food</b> to positive or negative categories {{as a function of}} process variables.

We aimed to replicate this phenomenon for taste (sweet/savoury), determine whether it extends to energy density (high/low) as well, and uncover whether this effect is modulated by hunger state. Twenty-nine healthy-weight females smelled four odours differing in the energy density and taste they signalled, one non-food odour, and one odourless solution (control), in random order, for three minutes each. Appetite for 15 food products was rated in the following two minutes. Mixed model analyses revealed that exposure to an odour signalling a specific taste (respectively sweet, savoury) led to a greater appetite for congruent food products (sweet/savoury) compared to incongruent food products (savoury p < 0. 001; sweet p < 0. 001) or <b>neutral</b> <b>food</b> products (p = 0. 02; p = 0. 003). A similar pattern was present for the energy-density category (respectively high-energy dense, low-energy dense) signalled by the odours (low-energy products p < 0. 001; high-energy products p = 0. 008). Hunger state {{did not have a}} significant impact on sensory-specific appetite. These results suggest that exposure to food odours increases appetite for congruent products, in terms of both taste and energy density, irrespective of hunger state.

Twelve wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons) were bilaterally presented with eight sounds from different contexts (threat, <b>neutral,</b> <b>food)</b> to test for auditory laterality. Head turns were recorded prior to and immediately following sound presentation. Behaviour was recorded for 150 seconds after presentation. Although sound differentiation was evident {{by the amount of}} exploration, vigilance and grooming performed after different sound types, this did not result in different patterns of head turn direction. Similarly, left-right proportions of head turns, walking events and food approaches in the post-sound period were comparable across sound types. A comparison of head turns performed before and after sound showed a significant change in turn direction (χ 2 1 = 10. 65, P = 0. 001) from a left preference during the pre-sound period (mean 58 % left head turns, CI 49 - 66 %) to a right preference in the post-sound (mean 43 % left head turns, CI 40 - 45 %). This provides evidence of a right auditory bias in response to the presentation of the sound. This study therefore demonstrates that laterality is evident in southern hairy-nosed wombats in response to a sound stimulus, although side biases were not altered by sounds of varying context...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{separate}} measurement of reflux of food and acid into the oesophagus in 37 healthy, ambulant subjects. This was performed by radiolabelling the food and monitoring its reflux with a small directional gamma detector, which was placed externally over the oesophagus, and connected to an ambulatory data recorder. The pH was measured with a conventional oesophageal pH electrode. This method permitted the separate characterisation of acid and <b>neutral</b> (<b>food)</b> components of gastro-oesophageal reflux. The gastric emptying characteristics of the test meal were also monitored by gamma scintigraphy in a separate experiment. The oesophageal pH fell below 4 for 3. 2 + 8. 6 /- 2. 3 % (mean (SD)) of the recording time. Food reflux alone occurred for 17. 8 + 53. 2 /- 13. 8 % of the recording time. Simultaneous food and acid reflux occurred for only 0. 95 + 5. 2 /- 1. 2 % of the time. Not every reflux event detected by a fall in pH was seen as an increase in counts as a result of reflux of food, and vice versa. This poor correlation of food and acid reflux implies incomplete mixing of food and acid in the stomach, and further shows the inadequacy of reflux diagnosis methods that depend on pH detection alone...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} shows in 4 studies that cognitive load {{can reduce the}} impact of temptations on cognition and behavior and, thus, challenges the proposition that distraction always hampers self-regulation. Participants performed different speeded categorization tasks with pictures of attractive and <b>neutral</b> <b>food</b> items (Studies 1 – 3) and attractive and unattractive female faces (Study 4), while we assessed their reaction times {{as an indicator of}} selective attention (Studies 1, 3, and 4) or as an indicator of hedonic thoughts about food (Study 2). Cognitive load was manipulated by a concurrent digit span task. Results show that participants displayed greater attention to tempting stimuli (Studies 1, 3, and 4) and activated hedonic thoughts in response to palatable food (Study 2), but high cognitive load completely eliminated these effects. Moreover, cognitive load during the exposure to attractive food reduced food cravings (Study 1) and increased healthy food choices (Study 3). Finally, individual differences in sensitivity to food temptations (Study 3) and interest in alternative relationship partners (Study 4) predicted selective attention to attractive stimuli, but again, only when cognitive load was low. Our findings suggest that recognizing the tempting value of attractive stimuli in our living environment requires cognitive resources. This has the important implication that, contrary to traditional views, performing a concurrent demanding task may actually diminish the captivating power of temptation and thus facilitate self-regulation...|$|R

Racemization at this pH does not occur in aspartame but rather in its diketopiperazine decomposition product. Our results indicate that the use of aspartame to sweeten <b>neutral</b> pH <b>foods</b> and beverages that are then heated at elevated temperature could generate D-aspartic acid and D-phenylalanine. The nutritive consequences of these D-amino acids in the human diet are not well established, and thus aspartame should probably not be used as a sweetener when the exposure of <b>neutral</b> pH <b>foods</b> and beverages to elevated temperatures is required. At pH 4, a typical pH of most foods and beverages that might be sweetened with aspartame, the half-lives are 47 hours for aspartic acid and 1200 hours for phenylalanine at 100 degrees C. Racemization at pH 4 takes place in aspartame itself. Although the racemization rates at pH 4 are slow and no appreciable racemization of aspartic acid and phenylalanine should occur during the normal use of aspartame, some food and beverage components could conceivably act as catalysts.

Fifty-two female Nursing (health discipline) and forty-eight Social Work (social science discipline) students participated in the experiment, which consisted of the presentation of 105 images of different categories (e. g., <b>neutral,</b> <b>food),</b> including 25 images of surgical procedure. Volunteers judged each picture according to its valence (pleasantness) and arousal using the Self-Assessment Manikin scale (dimensional approach). Additionally, the participants chose the word that best described what they felt while viewing each image (discrete emotion perspective). The average valence score for surgical procedure pictures for the Nursing group (M = 4. 57; SD = 1. 02) was higher than the score for the Social Work group (M = 3. 31; SD = 1. 05), indicating that Nursing students classified those images as less unpleasant than the Social Work students did. Additionally, the majority of Nursing students (65. 4 %) chose "neutral" as the word that best described what they felt while viewing the pictures. In the Social Work group, disgust (54. 2 %) was the emotion that was most frequently chosen. The evaluation of emotional stimuli differed according to the groups' personal/occupational relevance: Nursing students judged pictures of surgical procedure as less unpleasant than the Social Work students did, possibly reflecting an emotional regulation skill or some type of habituation that is critically relevant to their future professional work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Preferences for and {{consumption}} of bitter foods such as vegetables and fruit are important in addressing the epidemic of obesity as healthy dietary patterns contribute to its prevention. However, {{few studies have been}} undertaken to understand the preference for bitter-tasting foods. A generally accepted but not proven explanation is that these acquired preferences involve changes in affective and motivational processes in order to overcome the innate rejection of bitter tastes. To examine this issue we compared the hedonic and incentive responses to bitter substances among bitter likers and dislikers. In addition, the effects of hunger, stress and weight concern on bitter preferences were also explored. Fifty-nine healthy adults (age = 24. 8 ± 6. 3; body mass index = 22. 0 ± 2. 8) were divided into bitter likers and bitter dislikers according to their food preferences. Both groups sampled the unreinforced flavours of coffee, beer, chocolate and grapefruit under four motivational states induced by static pictures (<b>neutral,</b> <b>food,</b> stressor and obesity) at the time of testing. The results showed that the bitter solutions elicited less aversive responses (higher hedonic ratings and less intense disgust reactions) and fewer avoidance behaviours (slower response time and lower amount of water for rinsing) in bitter likers after viewing neutral images. On the other hand, likers exhibited a further reduction in disgust to coffee after viewing stressor pictures, and also drank more water after tasting chocolate following the obesity pictures, compared with the dislikers. The expression of disgust increased in bitter likers, as well as the amount of water used to rinse the mouth, after tasting chocolate following pictures showing obesity compared with pictures showing food. These results show, for the first time, not only the implication of affective and incentive components in reversal of the predisposition to reject bitterness but also the motivational modulation of the expression of rejection of bitter tastes in human...|$|R

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen the rise of high {{resolution}} datasets. One of the main surprises of analysing such data has been {{the discovery of a}} large genetic, phenotypic and behavioural variation and heterogeneous metabolic rates among individuals within natural populations. A parallel discovery from theory and experiments has shown a strong temporal convergence between evolutionary and ecological dynamics, but a general framework to analyse from individual-level processes the convergence between ecological and evolutionary dynamics and its implications for patterns of biodiversity in food webs has been particularly lacking. Here, as a first approximation to take into account intraspecific variability and the convergence between the ecological and evolutionary dynamics in large food webs, we develop a model from population genomics and microevolutionary processes that uses sexual reproduction, genetic-distance-based speciation and trophic interactions. We confront the model with the prey consumption per individual predator, species-level connectance and prey-predator diversity in several environmental situations using a large food web with approximately 25, 000 sampled prey and predator individuals. We show higher than expected diversity of abundant species in heterogeneous environmental conditions and strong deviations from the observed distribution of individual prey consumption (i. e. individual connectivity per predator) in all the environmental conditions. The observed large variance in individual prey consumption regardless of the environmental variability collapsed species-level connectance after small increases in sampling effort. These results suggest (1) intraspecific variance in prey-predator interactions has a strong effect on the macroscopic properties of food webs and (2) intraspecific variance is a potential driver regulating the speed of the convergence between ecological and evolutionary dynamics in species-rich food webs. These results also suggest that genetic-ecological drift driven by sexual reproduction, equal feeding rate among predator individuals, mutations and genetic-distance-based speciation {{can be used as a}} <b>neutral</b> <b>food</b> web dynamics test to detect the ecological and microevolutionary processes underlying the observed patterns of individual and species-based food webs at local and macroecological scales. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The United States currently does not require mandatory labeling of GM labeled foods and has no standards for what percentage of an ingredient in a food product can be genetically modified for the product to still be labeled non-GM. For the official "organic" certification by the United States, a food product must be genetically modified {{and there is no}} tolerance for any genetically modified content. This paper presents empirical evidence on consumers' value for non-GM foods that are certified to have no GM content and non-GM foods that could have ingredients that were up to one or five percent genetically modified. We estimate values using a laboratory auction experiment performed on 44 randomly chosen adult consumers in the Des Moines, IA, area, grouped in 3 experimental units. They participated in a random nth-price auction experiment, in which they bid on three familiar <b>neutral</b> <b>food</b> items that may be genetically modified. Using statistical design and econometric analysis, this paper will estimate the average value of tolerance levels to consumers, measured as the difference in the auction price of a certified non-GM food and a non-GM food that had a tolerance of one or five percent. This paper has two findings. We find evidence indicating consumers place value in a certified non-GM food product, as opposed to a non-GM food product with a tolerance. We find no evidence, however, that consumers value a product with a tolerance of one percent more than they value a product with a tolerance of five percent. Due to decreased firm costs of complying with a tolerance of five percent, we find evidence that if the United States decides to enact a tolerance standard, a five percent tolerance may be better than a one percent tolerance. This information could be useful to policy makers who are considering whether to write in an acceptable tolerance level for genetically modified material.

40|$|In many countries, {{including}} those in the European Union, Japan, Australia, and China, labeling is required for foods that contain genetically modified material. Other countries, including the United States, do not require mandatory labeling of GM foods. The United States, however, does allow firms to voluntarily label their products as non-GM. This {{raises the question of}} whether a mandatory labeling or voluntary labeling policy is more efficient. Proponents of voluntary labeling policies say they are less expensive, because only the firms that wish to label their products must incur the labeling costs. In a mandatory labeling regime, all firms would need to incur additional costs, whether the costs are due to product testing, label design, segregation, mistakes in labeling, etc. Many proponents of mandatory labeling of GM foods say that consumers have a "right to know" what they are eating and proponents claim that governments should mandate labels for foods made through genetic modification. This paper presents empirical evidence on consumers' value for foods with positive (i. e. this food is made with genetic engineering) labels versus and for foods with negative (i. e. this food is made without genetic engineering) labels. The positive label is likely to occur under a mandatory labeling system, while the negative label is likely to occur in a voluntary system. Thus, we present evidence on the consumer value of different labeling policies. We estimate values using a laboratory auction experiment performed on 142 randomly chosen adult consumers in the Des Moines, IA, and Saint Paul, MN, areas, grouped in 8 experimental units. They participated in a random nth-price auction experiment, in which they bid on three familiar <b>neutral</b> <b>food</b> items (an oil, a processed food, and a fresh food) that may be genetically modified. Experimental units are randomly assigned to the labeling treatment (i. e., food items with accurate GM food labels versus no food labels). Using statistical design and econometric analysis, this paper will estimate the average value of food label regimes to consumers. This will be measured as the difference in the auction price of a particular food item with and without a GM food label. We present evidence that shows that a voluntary labeling system elicits the same consumer reaction as a mandatory labeling system. Because a voluntary labeling policy would be less expensive to implement, this paper provides evidence that the United States should not abandon the current voluntary labeling system for a mandatory one. This information could be useful to U. S. public policy makers who must decide on GM food labeling legislation. Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} been unclear as to how {{restrained}} eating is related to implicit attitudes towards food. The present paper introduces a new variant of the affective priming paradigm to measure implicit attitudes towards food among restrained and unrestrained eaters, using food pictures as primes and emoticons as targets. Results of two studies show that while unrestrained eaters evaluate palatable foods more positively than <b>neutral</b> and unpalatable <b>foods,</b> restrained eaters do not. In addition, it is shown that restrained eaters have stronger evaluations of the negative aspects of palatable food, and this influences their food attitudes. Thus, the present findings suggest that restrained eaters’ chronic goal of dieting impacts their implicit attitude towards food items via {{their perception of the}} negative aspects of palatable food. These results are discussed with regard to the role of attitudes in the regulation of eating behavior...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{increasing}} {{requirement of}} <b>food</b> <b>neutral</b> biofuels demands {{the detection of}} alternative sources. The use of non-arable land and waste water streams is widely discussed in this regard. A Cyanobacterium was isolated on the area of a possible algae production side near a water treatment plant in the arid desert region al-Wusta. It was identified as Cyanobacterium aponinum PB 1 and is a possible lipid source. To determine its suitability of a production process using this organism, a set of laboratory experiments were performed. Its growth behavior was examined in regard to high temperatures and increasing NaCl concentrations. A productivity of 0. 1 g L- 1 per day was measured at an alga density below 0. 75 g L- 1. C. aponinum PB 1 {{showed no sign of}} altered growth behavior in media containing 70 g L- 1 NaCl or less. Detection of a negative effect of NaCl on the growth using Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation chlorophyll fluorescence analysis was not more sensitive than optical density measurement...|$|R
