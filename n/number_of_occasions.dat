40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eating <b>occasions</b> and snacks on dietary quality (DQ), defined as adherence to dietary recommendations. Methods: A sample of 884 adolescents (11 - 18 y) in the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) were included. The Diet Quality Index for Adolescents (DQI-A) was implemented. The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eating <b>occasions</b> and snacks was frequency of food or beverages consumed over 24 h {{and frequency of}} foods or beverages consumed outside of the three mealtimes respectively. Results were generated with and without low energy food under 210 KJ (50 kcal). Regression models were generated with DQ score as the outcome variable and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eating <b>occasions</b> and snacks as predictors. Results: The mean(95 %CI) DQ score was 31. 1 %(30. 2, 32. 0). The mean <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eating <b>occasions</b> and snacks was 7. 5 (7. 3, 7. 7) and 2. 6 (2. 6, 2. 7) times/day respectively. When low energy events were excluded, mean <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eating <b>occasions</b> and snacks reduced to 6. 2 (6. 1, 6. 4) and 2. 0 (2. 0, 2. 1) times/day respectively. DQ score increased by 0. 74 points (0. 42, 1. 05; p< 0. 01) and 0. 55 points (- 0. 08, 0. 69; p= 0. 17) for total eating occasions and snacks respectively. When low energy events were excluded, DQ score increased by 0. 30 points (- 0. 84, 0. 69; p= 0. 13) for each eating occasion and decreased by 1. 20 points (- 2. 1,- 0. 3; p< 0. 01) for each snack. Conclusion: Eating more frequently improves dietary quality especially if some eating occasions, are low in energy. A focus on replacing high-energy snacks with low-energy alternatives rather than reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eating <b>occasions</b> may result in improved dietary quality in adolescents...|$|R

40|$|Eating {{frequency}} may {{be important}} {{in the development of}} overweight and obesity and other cardiometabolic risk factors; however, the evidence is inconsistent. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the associations between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eating <b>occasions</b> and cardiometabolic risk factors in a national population-based sample of young adults. A cohort of 1273 men and 1502 women, aged 26 – 36 years, completed a meal pattern chart to record when they had eaten during the previous day (in hourly intervals). The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eating <b>occasions</b> was calculated. Diet quality was assessed, waist circumference was measured and a fasting blood sample was taken. Dietary intake was compared with the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. The associations between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eating <b>occasions</b> and cardiometabolic risk factors were calculated using linear regression. Analyses were adjusted for age, education and physical activity. Most men ate three to five times per d and most women ate four to six times. The proportion of participants meeting dietary recommendations increased with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eating <b>occasions.</b> For men, an additional eating occasion was associated with reductions in mean values for waist circumference (− 0 · 75 cm), fasting glucose (− 0 · 02 mmol/l), fasting insulin (− 0 · 34 mU/l; 2 · 04 pmol/l), TAG (− 0 · 03 mmol/l), total cholesterol (− 0 · 08 mmol/l) and LDL-cholesterol (− 0 · 06 mmol/l). Adjustment for waist circumference attenuated the results. Significant trends were not observed for women. In conclusion, a higher <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eating <b>occasions</b> were associated with reduced cardiometabolic risk factors in men. Many associations were mediated by waist circumference. <br /...|$|R

When designing a study, researchers have to consider tradeoffs of costs and benefits of different design features. We demonstrate how knowledge about power equivalent transformations between indicator measurement designs allows researchers to identify the most cost-efficient research design for detecting parameters of interest. Finally, we integrate different formal results to exhibit the tradeoff between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> measurement <b>occasions</b> and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> indicators per <b>occasion</b> for constant power in LGCMs...|$|R
