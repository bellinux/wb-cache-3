5|$|His father, Hyman Krustofski, was a rabbi and {{strongly}} opposed young Herschel's wish {{to become a}} comedian; he wanted the boy to go to yeshiva instead. Krusty did attend the school, where he said he made the other students laugh by doing funny impressions of his father. As a result, Krusty became a slapstick comedian behind his father's back. One night, Krusty performed at a rabbi's convention and a rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. Rabbi Krustofski, {{who was in the}} audience, recognized him, was furious and disowned his son, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been 25 years since they have seen or spoken to each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring {{goes around}} {{the belly of the}} armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But <b>now</b> (<b>it</b> <b>has</b> been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.|$|E

25|$|Actually, {{the stage}} play, as written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee from the novel of Patrick Dennis, {{was more like}} a movie script in its pile-up of {{pictorial}} business and its multiplicity of scenes.

25|$|In {{the early}} stage, glorification of the {{religious}} beliefs and lives was the theme {{of most of the}} novels. Later on, picturization of real Bengali life became a common topic. By the end of the fifties, the novelists gradually turned to human mind and its analysis. A great change of the theme came after 1971. Novels about the Liberation War of Bangladesh began to come forth. Even till <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> not ceased to be an interesting topic.|$|E

25|$|Originally named Plymouth North Road, it {{was opened}} in 1877 as a joint station for the Great Western Railway (GWR) and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR). It was {{expanded}} in 1908 but a major rebuilding scheme {{that started in}} 1938 was delayed by the Second World War and was not completed until 1962.

When the National Highway passes through the city, the traffic hurried to pass over the railway gates {{in the city and}} outskirts, which makes taffic worse. To avoid the traffic congestion, the {{government}} of India constructed a mini bypass road connecting Eastern locks and Vatluru on both ends of the city. Even then, the traffic problem could not be resolved. The main bypass road which was constructed under Golden Quadrilateral programme which was completed in the late 1990s but then only 10,000 vehicles passed through the main bypass road but <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> almost doubled.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality <b>now.</b> <b>It</b> <b>has</b> illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E

500|$|The Goodison Road Stand was {{partially}} demolished and rebuilt during the 1969–70 season with striking images of both {{old and new}} stands side by side. The new stand opened 1971, {{at a cost of}} £1 million. The new stand housed the 500 and 300 members clubs and an escalator to the tallest stand in the ground—the Top Balcony. However, not everyone thought that the upgrade was necessary at the time. Journalist Geoffrey Green of The Times wrote [...] "Goodison Park has always been a handsome fashionable stage for football, a living thing full of atmospherics-like a theatre. And <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> stepped into the demanding seventies with a facelift it scarcely seemed to need compared with some of us I know. New giant stands in place of the old; the latest in dazzling floodlight systems that cast not a shadow. A cathedral of a place indeed, fit for the gods of the game." ...|$|E
