5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of heating the steel to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does <b>not</b> <b>create</b> a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.|$|E

5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did <b>not</b> <b>create</b> a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|As for the {{development}} of the parochial system, David's traditional role as its creator can not be sustained. Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the Early Middle Ages, and the kind of system introduced by David's Normanising tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning, rather than creation; he made the Scottish system as a whole more like that of France and England, but he did <b>not</b> <b>create</b> it.|$|E

Although Beyoncé did <b>not</b> <b>create</b> beats, she came up with melodies and ideas she shared with the producers. With 43 songs completed — 15 of which made it to the album— Beyoncé is credited as co-writer and co-producer, as well as the album's executive producer alongside Matthew Knowles.|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s, {{the number}} of {{municipalities}} in Bergen County had reached 70, where it still stands. After the 1920s, the legislature did <b>not</b> <b>create</b> many new municipalities, but local officials used zoning to affect land use, making annexation less attractive. Because of boroughitis, the township {{as a form of}} government all but disappeared from Bergen County. One that remains is South Hackensack, the remnants of Lodi Township that no seceding borough wanted. Its three pieces are separated from each other by several miles.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{stated that}} the caste system in south India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked {{with the arrival of}} Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a {{different}} stratification of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do <b>not</b> <b>create</b> castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.|$|E

5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} milk caps infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do <b>not</b> <b>create</b> gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially soft, white hyphen fungus, also known as a subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other sac fungi, in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other milk caps. Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different milk caps and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|E
5|$|Before 1600, a major {{war broke}} out in eastern North America among Native Americans; it was later called the Beaver Wars. Five American Indian Iroquois tribes confederated to battle against their neighbors. The Iroquois were opposed by a {{confederation}} of primarily Algonquian tribes including the Shawnee, Miami, Wea, Pottawatomie, and the Illinois. These tribes were significantly less advanced than the Mississippian culture that had preceded them. The tribes were semi-nomadic, used stone tools rather than copper, and did <b>not</b> <b>create</b> the large-scale construction and farming works of their Mississippian predecessors. The war continued with sporadic fighting {{for at least a}} century as the Iroquois sought to dominate the expanding fur trade with the Europeans. They achieved this goal for several decades. During the war, the Iroquois drove the tribes from the Ohio Valley to the south and west. They kept control of the area for hunting grounds.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium {{improves}} many {{physical properties}} when added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron and nickel. Beryllium does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do <b>not</b> <b>create</b> sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications.|$|E

5|$|Born's {{position}} at Cambridge {{was only a}} temporary one, and his tenure at Göttingen was terminated in May 1935. He therefore accepted an offer from C. V. Raman to go to Bangalore in 1935. Born considered taking a permanent position there, but the Indian Institute of Science did <b>not</b> <b>create</b> an additional chair for him. In November 1935, the Born family had their German citizenship revoked, rendering them stateless. A few weeks later Göttingen cancelled Born's doctorate. Born considered an offer from Pyotr Kapitsa in Moscow, and started taking Russian lessons from Rudolf Peierls's Russian-born wife Genia. But then Charles Galton Darwin asked Born if he would consider becoming his successor as Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, an offer that Born promptly accepted, assuming the chair in October 1936.|$|E
5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do <b>not</b> <b>create</b> cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|From January 1918 to January 1921 Poulenc was a conscript in the French Army in {{the last}} months of the First World War and the {{immediate}} post-war period. Between July and October 1918 he served at the Franco-German front, after which he was given a series of auxiliary posts, ending as a typist at the Ministry of Aviation. His duties allowed him time for composition; the Trois mouvements perpétuels for piano and the Sonata for Piano Duet were written at the piano of the local elementary school at Saint-Martin-sur-le-Pré, and he completed his first song cycle, Le bestiaire, setting poems by Apollinaire. The sonata did <b>not</b> <b>create</b> a deep public impression, but the song cycle made the composer's name known in France, and the Trois mouvements perpétuels rapidly became an international success. The exigencies of music-making in wartime taught Poulenc much about writing for whatever instruments were available; then, and later, some of his works were for unusual combinations of players.|$|E
