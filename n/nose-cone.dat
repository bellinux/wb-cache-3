25|$|The Stemme S10 is a self-launching {{sailplane}} {{produced by}} Stemme AG in Strausberg (Germany) since the 1980s. The engine is mounted amidships and it features an unusual folding propeller which is stowed inside the aircraft's <b>nose-cone</b> when {{the engine is}} not in use.|$|E
25|$|The {{baseline}} LoADS {{design was}} a single-stage missile consisting of three stacked conical sections; a pointed conical <b>nose-cone,</b> a slightly flared cylinder through the midsection forming {{the majority of}} the missile body, and a flared rear section surrounding the rocket nozzles. It was very similar to the upper stage of the Sprint missile, although lacking the Sprint's small aerodynamic fins.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{independent}} {{double wishbone}} suspension was employed at all four corners. Another significant change {{made from the}} P61 design was to move the suspension shock absorber components outboard at the rear. This switch was initially made to accommodate the extra cam-cover space needed to employ the 32-valve motor, but though that unit was shelved the suspension geometry was retained. At the front, the coil spring and damper units were retained within the monocoque skin, resulting in a clean, aerodynamic profile around the car's <b>nose-cone.</b> Braking was by outboard-mounted, Dunlop disc brakes all round.|$|E
50|$|The {{front-end}} styling {{of these}} units {{consisted of a}} 'curved wedge', replacing the aircraft-style <b>nose-cones</b> of previous Shinkansen trains. The furthest forward point was {{the very bottom of}} the pilot. They were painted brilliant white with a medium-thick blue stripe beneath the windows.|$|R
50|$|Starrunner — A bird-like Starrior that {{is able to}} {{transform}} from a winged ostrich-like shape into a jet aircraft. Their control circuits are located behind a cockpit-like dome on their jet mode <b>nose-cones.</b> It is possible that their alternative form is their model, as unlike most things in the toyline and comic, it is a named weapon. Starrunners have only been seen as Destructors.|$|R
5000|$|Pyrolytic {{graphite}} is {{the main}} structural material in these pebbles. It sublimates at 4000 °C, {{more than twice the}} design temperature of most reactors. It slows neutrons very effectively, is strong, inexpensive, and {{has a long history of}} use in reactors and other very high temperature applications. For example, pyrolytic graphite is also used, unreinforced, to construct missile reentry <b>nose-cones</b> and large solid rocket nozzles. [...] Its strength and hardness come from anisotropic crystals of carbon.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the [...] season, it was {{announced}} that Montoya would be moving to McLaren in 2005. [...] The team began the season with a radical <b>nose-cone</b> design, known as the [...] "Walrus-Nose", that proved uncompetitive and was replaced by a more conventional assembly {{in the second half of}} the year. Ferrari dominated for a third consecutive season, winning 15 of the 18 races. [...] Williams picked-up a win at the final race in Brazil, with Juan Pablo Montoya finishing one second ahead of Kimi Räikkönen's McLaren; this remained Williams's last F1 win until the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix. Another memorable part of the season was when both Williams and Toyota were disqualified from the Canadian Grand Prix after it was discovered that both cars had brake irregularities, the brake ducts seemingly not conforming to regulations. Williams finished the season in fourth, scoring 88 points and finishing on the podium six times, while Montoya was the highest-placed Williams driver that year, scoring 58 points to finish in fifth position.|$|E

50|$|At {{cruising}} altitude (35,000-45,000 ft.), telescoping wings retract. Exterior sections of tail and <b>nose-cone</b> envelop cockpit and cabin fuselage for higher altitude pressurization.|$|E
40|$|Shadowgraphs of five {{space shuttle}} launch {{configurations}} are presented. The model was a 4 percent-scale space shuttle vehicle, {{tested in the}} 11 - by 11 -foot Transonic Wind Tunnel at Ames Research Center. The Mach number was varied from 0. 8 to 1. 4 with three angles of sideslip (0 deg, 5 deg and - 5 deg) {{that were used in}} conjunction with three angles of attack (4 deg, - 4 deg, and 0 deg). The model configurations included both series-burn and parallel-burn configurations, two canopy configurations, two positions of the orbiter nose relative to the HO tank nose, and two HO tank <b>nose-cones</b> angles (15 deg and 20 deg). The data consist entirely of shadowgraph photographs...|$|R
5000|$|One {{variant of}} the basic Fi 103 design did see {{operational}} use. The progressive loss of French launch sites as 1944 proceeded and the area of territory under German control shrank meant that soon the V-1 would lack the range to hit targets in England. Air-launching was one alternative utilised, but the most obvious solution was to extend the missile's range. Thus the F-1 version developed. The weapon's fuel tank was increased in size, with a corresponding reduction in {{the capacity of the}} warhead. Additionally, the <b>nose-cones</b> and wings of the F-1 models were made of wood, affording a considerable weight saving. With these modifications, the V-1 could be fired at London and nearby urban centres from prospective ground sites in the Netherlands. Frantic efforts were made to construct a sufficient number of F-1s in order to allow a large-scale bombardment campaign to coincide with the Ardennes Offensive, but numerous factors (bombing of the factories producing the missiles, shortages of steel and rail transport, the chaotic tactical situation Germany was facing {{at this point in the}} war, etc.) delayed the delivery of these long-range V-1s until February/March 1945. Beginning on 2 March 1945, slightly more than three weeks before the V-1 campaign finally ended, several hundred F-1s were launched at Britain from Dutch sites under Operation [...] "Zeppelin". Frustrated by increasing Allied dominance in the air, Germany also employed V1s to attack the RAF's forward airfields, such as Volkel, in the Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|The body {{design was}} unusual. Instead {{of using a}} multi-tubular {{spaceframe}} chassis like other Formula Junior cars, Saab chose to construct an advanced aluminium monocoque car, with a plastic <b>nose-cone.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Men into Space, a 1960 tie-in {{novel by}} Murray Leinster for the TV {{series of the}} same name, Ed McCauley makes the first manned {{suborbital}} spaceflight in the <b>nose-cone</b> of an Aerobee.|$|E
50|$|She {{returned}} to Newport 12 March 1959 and sailed 16 June for Mayport, Florida, {{her new home}} port. She acted as recovery ship for an experimental Project Mercury <b>nose-cone</b> which splashed off the Florida coast 25 June.|$|E

50|$|Most of the {{produced}} {{examples of}} the Bachem Ba 349 Natter ("Viper") manned vertical take-off rocket interceptor were armed with a battery of 24 Föhn missiles in its <b>nose-cone.</b> So far as is known, the Ba 349 was never used in combat, though the rocket weapon system was extensively ground-tested.|$|E
50|$|The 1986.5 Grand Prix 2+2 {{cosmetic}} features {{which included}} a NASCAR qualifying <b>nose-cone</b> was also available through GM for installation on any 1981-1987 Grand Prix. There were 17 Grand Prix GTs offered by Myrtle Motors in New York which offered a slightly different look and had some performance tuning in 1986.|$|E
50|$|The <b>nose-cone</b> {{attaches}} to a PC via USB. The resulting AVI file contains approximately 30 (between 30 and 35) seconds of uncompressed video at 9 frame/s at {{a resolution of}} 320 pixels wide by 240 pixels high (320x240). The data rate is 2047 kbit/s. The camera holds only one video at a time.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had lost}} its <b>nose-cone</b> and sponsons. The starboard sponson was damaged but retained its capacity to float; the port was undamaged and failed to float. Three of the five main blades had been sheared off, along with the rear rotor blades. The cabin was badly damaged. The port-side escape windows were missing.|$|E

5000|$|A {{very common}} <b>nose-cone</b> shape {{is a simple}} cone. This shape is often chosen for its ease of manufacture, and is also often (mis)chosen for its drag characteristics. A lower drag cone would be more streamlined, with the most optimal shape being a Sears-Haack body. The sides of a conical profile are {{straight}} lines, so the diameter equation is simply ...|$|E
50|$|Following {{the launch}} of the Soviet Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957, Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) was {{directed}} to proceed with the launching of a satellite using the Jupiter-C, which had already been flight-tested in <b>nose-cone</b> re-entry tests for the Jupiter IRBM (intermediate-range ballistic missile). Working closely together, ABMA and JPL completed the job of modifying the Jupiter-C to the Juno I and building the Explorer I in 84 days.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the launch}} of the Soviet Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) was {{directed}} to proceed with the launching of a satellite using the Juno-I four-stage variant of the three-stage Jupiter-C, which had already been flight-tested in <b>nose-cone</b> re-entry tests for the Jupiter IRBM (intermediate-range ballistic missile). Working closely together, ABMA and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) completed the job of modifying the Jupiter-C and building Explorer 1 in 84 days.|$|E
50|$|Moving {{north to}} Newport, Rhode Island, in 1952, the ship {{took part in}} fleet antisubmarine {{exercises}} off the coast. For the next 6 years Howard D. Crow followed this pattern of operations—antisubmarine training, exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean, and periodic overhauls. In 1957, she took part in important NATO exercises with almost 50 ships from a dozen countries and in 1958 the versatile ship acted as communications ship during a successful Jupiter <b>nose-cone</b> recovery off Puerto Rico.|$|E
50|$|The {{overall design}} of the X-20 Dyna-Soar was {{outlined}} in March 1960. It had a low-wing delta shape, with winglets for control rather than a more conventional tail. The framework of the craft was to be made from the René 41 super alloy, as were the upper surface panels. The bottom surface was to be made from molybdenum sheets placed over insulated René 41, while the <b>nose-cone</b> was to be made from graphite with zirconia rods.|$|E
50|$|The AD500 {{introduced}} {{new materials}} {{and technology to}} airship manufacture and operations. Materials used in the ship included thin single-ply polyester, coated with titanium dioxide-doped polyurethane, for the envelope;Kevlar for the cables suspending the gondola {{from the top of}} the envelope; a Kevlar <b>nose-cone</b> moulded in the same manner as glass-reinforced plastic; and a gondola moulded by Vickers-Slingsby from Kevlar-reinforced plastic. Other innovations featured in the AD500 included simplified controls and thrust vectoring ducted fans driven by inboard-mounted Porsche engines.|$|E
5000|$|On January 28, 1986, the USS Guam {{was off the}} East Coast of Florida {{en route}} to Operational Trials, [...] "Oppies", off of Puerto Rico when, while many crewmen were {{watching}} it on TV, the Space Shuttle Challenger blew up nearly immediately above them. USS Guam recovered many floating pieces of debris from the disaster, including a <b>nose-cone</b> {{from one of the}} booster rockets. For her around-the-clock efforts in the recovery mission her crew earned a Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Citation.|$|E
50|$|Jean Alesi made an {{excellent}} start from sixth to lead polesitter Damon Hill {{into the first}} corner, but ran wide and struck a tyre stack between the two Lesmos on the opening lap and lost the lead to Hill. Alesi was fortunate to escape with his own car undamaged, but his error caused a tyre to fall on the track and break the front wing of Mika Häkkinen's McLaren. Häkkinen was forced to pit for a new <b>nose-cone,</b> dropping him to seventeenth on the track.|$|E
50|$|While {{driving for}} Ron Hemelgarn, Fox was seriously injured during the 1995 Indianapolis 500 {{in one of}} the most serious {{accidents}} in the history of the race. After starting ninth, Fox went low into the first turn on the first lap of the race and spun. His car connected with the car of Eddie Cheever, Jr. and slammed into the outside wall. Several other cars also became involved. The front <b>nose-cone</b> was ripped from his car, exposing his legs. Fox suffered serious head injuries.|$|E

5000|$|On her return, Gyatt {{joined in}} America's space program. Taking <b>nose-cone</b> {{recovery}} station from 5-10 November 1960 and from 24-26 April 1961 {{to aid in}} Project Mercury, she pioneered another area of expanding seapower. With another world crisis pending over the status of Berlin, she again sailed 3 August 1961 to bolster the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. She remained on alert posture with the [...] "steel gray stabilizers" [...] in the Mediterranean until 3 March 1962, then resumed training along the eastern seaboard out of Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E
50|$|The Lotus Seven was {{designed}} with racing in mind, and lightness was of primary concern to Chapman. A front-mounted engine driving {{the rear wheels}} (a similar layout to most cars of the day) and a very lightweight steel spaceframe was covered with unstressed aluminium panel bodywork. The body panels were mainly flat to avoid the expense of more elaborate curved bodywork, and the simple cloth lined plastic doors were hinged from the windscreen. The <b>nose-cone</b> and wheel arches were originally aluminium parts, but these were replaced in the later S2 and S3 models with painted or self-coloured fibreglass.|$|E
50|$|Jacques Villeneuve sent a tyre {{spinning}} into David Coulthard's {{car at the}} Ascari chicane on {{the opening}} lap in a similar incident while trying to pass Michael Schumacher. Villeneuve was able to continue, although the collision with the tyre stack bent his suspension, which slowed his car and forced him to pit for {{a new set of}} tyres, a new <b>nose-cone</b> and a new steering wheel, dropping him to sixteenth place and putting him a lap behind. Coulthard was less fortunate, and immediately spun off with a broken suspension pushrod. Villeneuve apologised to Coulthard after the race.|$|E
50|$|The Skyship 500 {{consists}} of a polyester fabric envelope, retaining helium gas, and carrying a gondola for the control cabin, passenger cabin, propulsion systems and ballast (fixed and jettison-able). The envelope is of a traditional streamlined shape with cruciform tail surfaces which carry rudder and elevator control surfaces for yaw and pitch. The undercarriage {{consists of}} a castoring twin-wheeled oleo-pneumatic strut {{at the rear of}} the gondola, with ground handling ropes for ground crew to manoeuvre the airship on the ground. The <b>nose-cone</b> of the envelope also carries the mooring point which can connect to a mobile mooring mast.|$|E
50|$|Bull {{concurrently}} {{worked on}} the Scud project, making calculations for the new <b>nose-cone</b> needed for the higher re-entry speeds and temperatures the missile would face. Over {{a period of a}} few months following, his apartment suffered several non-robbery break-ins, apparently as a threat or a warning, but he continued to work on the project. In March 1990 he was assassinated. One account states he was shot five times in the head and back at point blank range while approaching the door of his apartment in Brussels. Another account states he was shot by a three-man team on March 20, 1990, when he answered the doorbell.|$|E
50|$|For {{the second}} {{successive}} race, Gerhard Berger spun off {{while trying to}} pass teammate Jean Alesi on lap 43. Alesi continued to third place, while further behind Martin Brundle, running fourth following Berger's exit, had to pit for a new <b>nose-cone</b> following a collision with Pedro Lamy's Minardi when Lamy inadvertently hit Brundle's front wing as he attempted to rejoin the track after a spin on lap 45, dropping Brundle to seventh and handing fourth place to David Coulthard's McLaren. Brundle eventually recovered to sixth place behind Mika Häkkinen in the sister McLaren after getting past Johnny Herbert courtesy of a faster final pit stop.|$|E
