25|$|In the Netherlands, {{the name}} rijksdaalder lived {{on until the}} gulden was {{replaced}} by the euro in 2002. But in the Caribbean the coin still exists today.

2500|$|The Dutch guilder ( [...] , [...] ) or fl. was the {{currency}} of the Netherlands from the 17th century until 2002, when it {{was replaced by the}} euro.

The <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antillean</b> <b>guilder</b> is still in use in Curaçao and Saint Maarten (two countries in the Kingdom of the Netherlands), but this currency is distinct from the Dutch guilder.

50|$|The <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antillean</b> <b>guilder</b> will {{continue}} to circulate and plans to implement the Caribbean guilder will not be finalized until the islands' Central Bank situation is resolved.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{possibility}} of referring Surinam and <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antillean</b> drug users from a 'low-threshold' municipal methadone programme to general practice for methadone maintenance treatment. (Methadone maintenance treatment for drug users leads to a more regulated life and {{makes it possible to}} implement measures to ameliorate their living conditions.) Fewer Surinam and <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antillean</b> drug users are referred to general practice than native Dutch drug users. DESIGN: Descriptive. SETTING: Municipal Health Service, Department of Mental Health, Unit on Drugs, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. METHOD: 141 Surinam and <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antillean</b> drug users participating in the 'low-threshold' methadone programme were examined on the following items: psychiatric status, drug and alcohol abuse, judicial problems, relationships, personal care, insurance and housing. With these items the level of regulated drug use was assessed and the possible reference to general practice evaluated. RESULTS: 21 % of the drugs user group was found to be well regulated. They could have been referred to general practice immediately. Another 18 % were also well regulated but they received methadone on a daily basis at the moment of investigation; when they would have proven to manage methadone prescription on a weekly basis, they could also be referred to general practice. 61 % could not be referred because they were addicted to benzodiazepines (22 %) or alcohol (33 %), lived in unsuitable housing (45 %), had judicial problems (53 %), psychiatric problems (30 %) or no insurance (15 %), or were very problematic drug users receiving Palfium (dextromoramide) through the 'low-threshold' municipal methadone programme (15 %). CONCLUSION: Of Surinam and <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antillean</b> drug users from a municipal methadone programme, approximately 20 % could have been directly referred to general practice for their methadone maintenance treatment and 20 % at a later stage, and 60 % could no...|$|R
50|$|Following the referendums on all islands, {{the first}} Round Table Conference between the islands, the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antillean</b> government, and the Netherlands was {{organized}} on 26 November 2005. It was agreed that Curaçao and Sint Maarten should become countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, while {{the three other}} islands should become directly part of the Netherlands. Agreement was reached that the Netherlands would take over the debts of the Netherlands Antilles, on condition that the islands would commit themselves to producing balanced budgets, so as to prevent future buildups of debt. A Board for Financial Supervision (Dutch: College financieel toezicht (Cft)), composed of members from both the Netherlands Antilles and the Netherlands, would be installed to supervise the budgets of the islands and of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antillean</b> government.|$|R
50|$|Until 1 January 2011, {{the three}} islands used the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antillean</b> guilder; after {{that all three}} {{switched}} to the US dollar, rather than the euro (which {{is used in the}} European Netherlands) or the Caribbean guilder (which is being adopted by the other two former Antillean islands of Curaçao and Sint Maarten).|$|R
50|$|The florin (sign: Afl.; code: AWG) is the {{currency}} of Aruba. It is subdivided into 100 cents.

50|$|A large {{percentage}} of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilleans</b> descended from European colonists and African slaves who were brought and traded here from the 17th to 19th centuries.

50|$|Most <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilleans</b> were Dutch {{citizens}} and this status permitted and encouraged {{the young and}} university-educated to emigrate to the Netherlands.
