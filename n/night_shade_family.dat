50|$|On July 9, 2010, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) placed <b>Night</b> <b>Shade</b> Books on {{probation}} after it admitted to, and apologized to, authors for contractual irregularities. On November 30, 2011, SFWA lifted the probation based on good behavior during the probationary period. However, an investigation was reopened when further complaints were submitted to SFWA the following year. Once <b>Night</b> <b>Shade</b> Books {{indicated that it}} was possibly facing bankruptcy, SFWA subsequently delisted <b>Night</b> <b>Shade</b> Books as a qualifying market around April 2013. Two interested parties, Skyhorse Publishing and Start Publishing, offered to buy out the contracts and continue <b>Night</b> <b>Shade</b> Books as an imprint of their respective companies. On June 3, 2013, the final details of the corporate acquisition were announced.|$|R
