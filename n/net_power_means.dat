40|$|We {{present a}} generic {{methodology}} for organic Rankine cycle optimization, where the working fluid is included as an optimization parameter, {{in order to}} maximize the <b>net</b> <b>power</b> output of the cycle. The method is applied on two optimization cases with hot fluid inlet temperatures at 120 °C and 90 °C. Pure fluids and mixtures are compared to see how mixed working fluids affect performance and important design parameters. The results indicate that mixed working fluids can increase the <b>net</b> <b>power</b> output of the cycle, while reducing the pressure levels. The maximum <b>net</b> <b>power</b> output is obtained by fluids with a critical temperature close to half of the hot fluid inlet temperature. For some mixtures we find the maximum <b>net</b> <b>power</b> when the temperature glide of condensation matches the temperature increase of the cooling water, while for other mixtures there are large differences between these two parameters. Ethane is a fluid that obtains a large <b>net</b> <b>power</b> increase when used in mixtures. Compared to pure ethane, an optimized ethane/propane mixture attains a 12. 9 % <b>net</b> <b>power</b> increase when the hot fluid inlet temperature is 120 _C and a 11. 1 % <b>net</b> <b>power</b> increase when the hot fluid inlet temperature is 90 °C...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPerformance {{of organic}} Rankine cycle (ORC) system to recover {{low-temperature}} waste heat from aluminum reduction cell was analyzed. The temperature of waste heat is 80 °C- 200 °C {{and the flow}} rate is 3 × 105 m 3 /h. The pinch temperature difference between waste heat and working fluids is 10 °C.

40|$|AbstractReverse {{electrodialysis}} (RED) is {{a technology}} to generate power from mixing waters with different salinity. The <b>net</b> <b>power</b> density (i. e. power per membrane area) {{is determined by}} 1) the membrane potential, 2) the ohmic resistance, 3) the resistance due to changing bulk concentrations, 4) the boundary layer resistance and 5) the power required to pump the feed water. Previous power density estimations often neglected the latter three terms. This paper provides a set of analytical equations to estimate the <b>net</b> <b>power</b> density obtainable from RED stacks with spacers and RED stacks with profiled membranes. With the current technology, the obtained maximum <b>net</b> <b>power</b> density is calculated at 2. 7 W/m 2. Higher power densities could be obtained by changing the cell design, in particular the membrane resistance and the cell length. Changing these parameters one and two orders of magnitude respectively, the calculated <b>net</b> <b>power</b> density is close to 20 W/m 2...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} maximizing <b>net</b> <b>power</b> output in a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell system. The <b>net</b> <b>power</b> production depends heavily on the oxygen excess ratio in the cathode.

A constrained extremum seeking control architecture is presented to effectively regulate oxygen excess ratio about an optimum value that maximizes <b>net</b> <b>power</b> output over {{a broad range of}} operating conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that this control technique improves fuel cell system performance and our constrained optimization approach enables faster convergence rates for an admissible level of overshoot.

40|$|OBJECTIVE : To {{determine}} {{the reliability of}} the measurement of <b>net</b> joint <b>power</b> during repeated gait measurements within one day and between two different measurement days. METHODS : Thirty able-bodied men who underwent repeated gait measurements within a day and between days participated in this research. An acceptable trial was one in which the participant complied with the range of walking speed 1. 45  m/s ±  5 %. Three-dimensional angles, angular velocities, net moments of force and <b>net</b> <b>power</b> for the ankle, knee and hip joints were determined using external passive reflective markers, an 8 -camera motion analysis system and two force plates. RESULTS : This study presents the patterns of the <b>net</b> <b>power</b> in the fundamental joints of the lower limbs in young healthy men at standard gait velocity. Intraclass correlation coefficients for <b>net</b> joint <b>power</b> measure reached values in the range of. 70 to. 89 on the first day, from. 69 to. 86 on the second day, and from. 67 to. 83 in total.

The irreversibilities of the open and direct solar thermal Brayton cycle with recuperator are mainly due to heat transfer across a finite temperature difference and fluid friction, which limit the <b>net</b> <b>power</b> output of such a system. In this work, the method of total entropy generation minimisation is applied to optimise the geometries of the receiver and recuperator at various steady-state weather conditions. For each steady-state weather condition, the optimum turbine operating point is also found.
