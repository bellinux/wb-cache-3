5|$|The city's {{design was}} {{influenced}} by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation. The growth and development of Canberra were hindered by the World Wars and the Great Depression, which exacerbated a series of planning disputes and the ineffectiveness of a procession of bodies that were created in turn to oversee the development of the city. The <b>national</b> <b>capital</b> emerged as a thriving city after World War II, as Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies championed its development and the <b>National</b> <b>Capital</b> Development Commission was formed with executive powers. Although the Australian Capital Territory is now self-governing, the Commonwealth Government retains some influence through the <b>National</b> <b>Capital</b> Authority.|$|E

40|$|<b>National</b> {{intellectual}} <b>capital</b> {{is regarded}} as an important factor of a country’s ability to perform high value added functions including {{the ability to create}} innovations. Measuring <b>national</b> intellectual <b>capital</b> is still a complicated task. In this article <b>national</b> intellectual <b>capital</b> concept and measurement models are analysed in order to show how <b>national</b> intellectual <b>capital</b> could be measured. The findings show that there are several weaknesses of measurement models validity. Those weaknesses in more recent measurement models are minimized by introducing advanced <b>national</b> intellectual <b>capital</b> structural models and more complex value approximation methods. Analysis of selected <b>national</b> intellectual <b>capital</b> measurement models has shown that there are not many similar indicators used (from 21 % to 60 % of matching indicators), though results obtained by using these evaluation models have high significant correlation...|$|R

5000|$|Bangkok, {{the capital}} of Thailand, has been called [...] "the most primate city on Earth", being roughly thirty-five times larger than Thailand's second-largest city of Nakhon Ratchasima. Fong's {{examination}} of the primate city during the 2010 Thai political protests was notable. Taking the concept and applying it to the role that primate cities play if they are <b>national</b> <b>capitals,</b> his study noted that when primate cities like Bangkok function as <b>national</b> <b>capitals,</b> they are inherently vulnerable to insurrectionary dynamics by the subaltern, and the dispossessed. He cites {{the simple fact that}} most primate cities serving as <b>national</b> <b>capitals</b> contain major headquarters for the country. Thus, logistically, it is rather [...] "efficient" [...] for national targets to be contested since they are all located within one major urban environment.|$|R
