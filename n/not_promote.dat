5|$|Following {{the release}} of Bleach in June 1989, Nirvana {{embarked}} on its first national tour, and the album became a favorite of college radio stations. Due to increasing differences between Everman {{and the rest of}} the band over the course of the tour, Nirvana canceled the last few dates and drove back to Washington. No one told Everman he was fired at the time, while Everman later said that he actually quit the group. Although Sub Pop did <b>not</b> <b>promote</b> Bleach as much as other releases, it was a steady seller, and had initial sales of 40,000 copies. However, Cobain was upset by the label's lack of promotion and distribution for the album. In late 1989, the band recorded the Blew EP with producer Steve Fisk.|$|E
5|$|Nunavut {{features}} {{a number of}} outdoor adventure activity opportunities {{as a result of}} the territory's vast uninhabited area. Wildlife watching is one particularly popular activity - the territory is home to walrus and belugas, as well as eleven bird sanctuaries housing millions of birds. Muskox are also spread throughout Nunavut, although the territory's tourism authority does <b>not</b> <b>promote</b> 'muskox watching' trips specifically. The territory is also home to a population of polar bears, and trips designed to increase tourists' chances of spotting a polar bear are common. A number of private operators offer wildlife, bird, polar and whale watching tours, in addition to other activities.|$|E

5|$|Illustrator and {{designer}} Kory Heinzen worked on pre-visualization, concept and character design {{on the video}} game , developed by Naughty Dog. Heinzen's initial concept differed from the finished character. The production staff drew inspiration from the pulp adventure genre when creating the video games in the Uncharted series, and based Drake on the stereotypical characters of adventure films and novels, giving him wit, resourcefulness, and strong principles. Naughty Dog wanted to highlight Drake's personality through his interactions with the environment during gameplay. To do this, they developed {{a wide range of}} animations for Drake, allowing him to display reactions and his snarky disposition in context. These animations were designed to be fluid and believable; they removed any animation that did <b>not</b> <b>promote</b> this fluidity or took a large amount of time to execute. The blended animation system in the game, with more than 30animations comprising one movement, was implemented to make Drake a more relatable character.|$|E

25|$|The {{memory of}} the war of 1812 was not {{especially}} important in the decades that followed it.
