The structure of these headings, however, will not always be able to be guaranteed as required by GARR, and the tracings will not necessarily be complete.

The survey is a result of an initiative by the IFLA Bibliography Section to gather and update information on the status of the national bibliographies in the regions where the WLICs are being held. 10 <b>national</b> <b>bibliographic</b> <b>agencies</b> (NBAs) have responded to the survey. The main findings are: • The agencies acquire materials through legal deposit • Legal deposit legislation still emphasizes print material • The agencies should revise legislation to include more types of materials, especially electronic documents • Most agencies consider their legal deposit system to be effective • In awaiting new legal deposit legislation agencies include material under bibliographic control that is not provided for under the current legislation. • The <b>national</b> <b>bibliographic</b> <b>agencies</b> are committed to producing national bibliographies • The national bibliography is becoming increasingly diversified in terms of including different types of material, but there is still a clear emphasis on text formats • None of the agencies record e-books or e-journals in their national bibliography • Most countries do not consider the distribution of the national bibliography to be effective • Timeliness and coverage remains a problem • The agencies use international standards in cataloguing, classification and use of numbering systems • No countries have CIP programmes • All agencies print their national bibliography • Only one agency publishes the national bibliography on the Internet at the moment, but several agencies plan to follow • Only one agency has MARC-based record...|$|R

The survey is a result of an initiative by the IFLA Bibliography Section to gather and update information on the status of the national bibliographies in the regions where the WLICs are being held. 14 <b>national</b> <b>bibliographic</b> <b>agencies</b> (NBAs) have responded to the survey. The main findings are that many agencies are presently revising or planning to revise their legislation to include more types of material, in particular electronic documents. While the national bibliographies are becoming more diversified in terms of including different types of material, there is still a clear emphasis on print/text formats. With a few exceptions the percentage of material under bibliographic control is higher than the inclusion of the materials in the national bibliographies. Online/Internet access is the preferred format for national bibliographies, and NBAs are increasingly focusing on Internet access. Most countries consider the distribution of the national bibliography to be effective, still timeliness and coverage is known to be a problem in some countries in the area.

40|$|Since 1992, {{when the}} Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania {{undertook}} {{the function of}} bibliographic control, {{a decision was made}} to reorganize it in accordance with international standards and recommendations in order to computerize preparation of the national retrospective bibliography and join the international UBCIM Programme. In 1993 a concept for a <b>national</b> <b>bibliographic</b> data bank was prepared and approved. Analysis of the UBC and UBCIM international programmes, the ICBNS recommendations and other normative documents drafted for the purposes of <b>national</b> <b>bibliographic</b> <b>agencies</b> shows that the function of the Lithuanian bibliographic control fully complies with the essential provisions of these documents, ensuring comprehensiveness of the scope of both current and national retrospective bibliographies and creation of bibliographic and authority records of all types including publications in different languages and scripts; preparation of bibliographic and authority records in compliance with international standards and other normative documents making the basis of the LIBIS linguistic supply; and long-term preservation of bibliographic and authority records. The <b>National</b> <b>Bibliographic</b> Data Bank (NBDB) has been set up, the main purpose of which is to preserve and disseminate bibliographic information about Lithuanian documents and foreign documents related to Lithuania. On the basis of NBDB, computerized national retrospective databases have been created. After the first stage of the creation of NBDB was accomplished, it became necessary to prepare a concept for its expansion including the types of documents that were beyond the scope of bibliographic control and plan the framework for publications of the national retrospective bibliography including title of series, selection of materials and other important aspects...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research {{was carried out in}} order to gather information on the current situation and practices of libraries in Kuwait so as to investigate the possibly of designing a model for establishment of a <b>national</b> <b>bibliographic</b> network in the State of Kuwait. As context for the research, background is provided on <b>national</b> <b>bibliographic</b> networks in developed countries and in the Arab World, together with consideration of the role of a national library in such a network. In order to gather data, three questionnaire surveys (for library administrators, cataloguers and automation specialists) were distributed to all types of libraries in Kuwait. Information was sought on the composition and training of staff, {{the nature and extent of}} library resources and databases, the degree of automation of systems and services, and the nature of co-operation and resource sharing. Opinions were also sought on the feasibility of establishing centralised cataloguing and the implementation of a <b>national</b> <b>bibliographic</b> network. Follow-up interviews were also carried out, and professionals in both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were consulted for advice on practical solutions and recommendations for an effective <b>national</b> <b>bibliographic</b> network. The findings of the questionnaire surveys indicated some deficiencies that Kuwait libraries face: the absence of a leadership role by the national library; lack of a deposit law for national publications that would ensure a collection that would provide central focal point for a national information infrastructure; coverage by the national bibliography is neither comprehensive nor adequate; there are no formal systems of co-operation for resource sharing; implementation of standards for bibliographic services has been ineffective; many libraries still lack automated systems; lack of professional staff was noted by all sectors. Nevertheless, respondents were positive in their concern for needing strong leadership, adequate financial support for the national library, and expressed a desire for co-operation, which was felt to be possible even under the current circumstances. Based on the findings of the survey and experience described in the literature, it is concluded that a national library is the most appropriate body to develop and maintain the bibliographic databases that would be the centre of <b>national</b> <b>bibliographic</b> network. A model for such a network is presented, discussing the links to different libraries in the country and the duties and responsibilities of the national and other libraries in attaining successful functioning of the network.
