We estimate a model of hours of caring and hours of work using a large micro dataset of UK households.

5|$|Bacterial {{insecticides}} can {{be effective}} if application is targeted towards the vulnerable early-instar larvae. Two strains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce toxins which kill the larvae. Other forms of pest control, through non-pesticidal management are available. Feeding can be inhibited by applying antifeedants, such as fungicides or products derived from Neem (Azadirachta indica), but these may have <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the plants as well. The steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and these chemicals are strongly repellent to L. decemlineata.|$|E

5|$|The station {{started to}} trial the {{co-firing}} of petcoke (petroleum coke) {{in one of}} its boilers in June 2005, ending in June 2007, burning 15% petcoke and 85% coal. Petcoke was burned to make the electricity more competitive as the price of running the FGD equipment was making the electricity more expensive. The Environment Agency (EA) granted permission for the trial in June 2004, despite the plans being opposed by Friends of the Earth and Selby Council. To meet their concerns, emissions were constantly monitored through the trial, and they were not allowed to burn petcoke without operating the FGD plant to remove the high sulphur content of the emissions. The trial proved that there were no significant <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the environment, and so in late 2007 Drax Group applied to move from trial conditions to commercial burn. The EA granted permission in early 2008 after agreeing with Drax's findings that the fuel had no significant <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the environment. The station can now burn up to 300,000 tonnes of the fuel a year, and stock up to 6,000 tonnes on site.|$|E
5|$|Australia allows gay men {{and lesbians}} to serve openly. Openly gay and lesbian {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service did not have any <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> seabirds, and these effects, {{particularly}} on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E

They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs {{in part because of}} associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E

Many species of open country have benefited greatly from anthropogenic changes to the landscape, with the great increase in reliable seed food sources, available water and have also adapted well to a diet including foreign foodstuffs. This benefit appears to be restricted to Australian species, as cockatoos favouring open country outside Australia have not become more abundant. Predominantly forest-dwelling species have suffered greatly from habitat destruction; in the main, {{they appear to have}} a more specialised diet and {{have not been able to}} incorporate exotic food into their diet. A notable exception is the yellow-tailed black cockatoo in eastern Australia.|$|E
5|$|Starfish {{sometimes}} have <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> ecosystems. Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish have caused damage to coral reefs in Northeast Australia and French Polynesia. A study in Polynesia found that coral cover declined drastically {{with the arrival}} of migratory starfish in 2006, dropping from 50% to under 5% in three years. This had an unintended effect on reef-feeding fish and the whole benthic community. Asterias amurensis is one of a few echinoderm invasive species. Its larvae likely arrived in Tasmania from central Japan via water discharged from ships in the 1980s. The species has since grown in numbers {{to the point where they}} threaten commercially important bivalve populations. As such, they are considered pests, and are on the Invasive Species Specialist Group's list of the world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E

CLM’s <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> in-couple residence is seen for less educated men and women mainly because of its <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> cohabitation. Another finding consistent with our model’s prediction is that CLM only has a <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> in-couple residence of men with a college education, and not on their female counterparts. This effect is found separately for the likelihood of marriage and that of cohabitation. We also find that CLM has a larger <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> in-couple residence of women with no college education than on that {{of women who are}} college-educated. Childless men and {{women are more likely to}} respond to changes in CLM. Our demand and supply model of marriage helps explain these findings.|$|R
