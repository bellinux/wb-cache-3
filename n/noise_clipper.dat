40|$|Impulsive {{noise is}} one of the main channel {{impairments}} in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) -based power line communications (PLC). Clipping nonlinearites such as conventional clipping, blanking, joint blanking/clipping, and deep clipping have been proposed to mitigate the impulsive noise. However, OFDM systems result in high peak amplitude after inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) at the transmitter, which leads to large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). High peak amplitude can be falsely clipped by the impulsive <b>noise</b> <b>clipper</b> at the receiver leading to poor system performance. In this paper we propose a joint peak amplitude clipping and impulsive noise clipping nonlinearities to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance...|$|E
