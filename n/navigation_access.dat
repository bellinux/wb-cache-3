40|$|Abstract—Web users {{clustering}} is {{a crucial}} task for mining information related to users needs and preferences. Up to now, popular clustering approaches build clusters based on usage patterns derived from users ’ page preferences. This paper empha-sizes the need to discover similarities in users ’ accessing behavior {{with respect to the}} time locality of their navigational acts. In this context, we present two time aware clustering approaches for tuning and binding the page and time visiting criteria. The two tracks of the proposed algorithms define clusters with users that show similar visiting behavior at the same time period, by varying the priority given to page or time visiting. The proposed algorithms are evaluated using both synthetic and real datasets and the experimentation has shown that the new clustering schemes result in enriched clusters compared to those created by the conventional non-time aware users clustering approaches. These clusters contain users exhibiting similar access behavior {{not only in terms of}} their page preferences but also of their access time.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} areas in the forefront of non-immersive virtual reality (VRML) applications to architecture is the one that concerns the design, construction and exploration of on-line multi-access worlds using the Internet-WWW. However, and despite the great proliferation of earlier single-access models built on VRML, attempts to collect, classify and provide accesibility that type of models has proved almost nil. On the other side, one of the architectural typologies that promises the greatest transformation potential in the virtual architecture area in cyberspace is the one that concerns virtual museums and galleries. This paper seeks to provide a bridge between the two aforementioned approaches by formulating a conceptual basis {{for the creation of a}} virtual, on-line, multi-access museum intended to house collections of VRML building models. Such models, initially shown at a conventional model scale, would be accessed by visitors through an interface intended to transport those visitors into the models’ environments, where changes in scale could provide <b>navigation</b> <b>access</b> to interior and exterior view of the building. Accordingly, the museum would act as a sort of "spaceport” toward different routes of exploration.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{information}} available {{in the world is}} staggering and exciting. However, too much information can be a debilitating problem, and overwhelm people {{to such an extent that}} they cannot complete the tasks they set out to do. Even e-dictionaries can have so much information that users do not get the information they really need. Though technology has been the main enabler of the overload of information, it can also be a lifeline. Technology can, and should, be used to enhance e-dictionaries to give users relevant information on demand. Unfortunately, many current e-dictionaries do not make use of the innovative technologies available and drown users in information. This led the researcher to ask to what extent developments in information technology enable e-dictionaries to provide relevant information on demand. To answer the above question, this study started by exploring the current ideals lexicographers have for e-dictionaries, as well as the technologies available to create such ideal e-dictionaries. General usability guidelines were also reviewed. Based on this literature review, a set of criteria was developed according to which e-dictionaries can be evaluated. The main criteria are based on issues related to content, information architecture, <b>navigation,</b> <b>access,</b> help, customisation and innovative technologies. The criteria are intended to allow one to evaluate to what extent e-dictionaries make use of technology to really provide relevant information. The criteria were then used to evaluate five e-dictionaries. A qualitative study was done. Four existing e-dictionaries were evaluated by the researcher using heuristic evaluation. A fifth prototype dictionary, the Afrikaanse idiome-woordeboek, was evaluated by the researcher, but also evaluated by seven users through usability testing. In the light of the findings of these evaluations, the researcher was able to make recommendations regarding future developments of e-dictionaries.

40|$|In {{this final}} {{report on the}} {{investigation}} of the potentialities of improved coastal engineering management of Jupiter Inlet, Florida, three management-guiding issues were considered: better control of the erosion of the south beach, better <b>navigation</b> <b>access</b> and safety, and better control (reduction) of sediment influx into the inlet channel and upstream points in the Loxahatchee River estuary. The first two issues have been particularly outstanding, due to persistent concern for the inherent deficiencies in the protocol for sand pumping and placement on the beach that tends to erode away rapidly, and the concern for conditions for navigation of vessels in the proximity of the inlet in open waters. With regard to the third issue, despite the reasonably successful ongoing program to pump sand out of the borrow areas within the inlet channel, other areas such as some of the marinas in the inlet area, as well as the region of the Loxahatchee River west of the Florida East Coast Railroad bridge, have been experiencing slow but persistent sedimentation. Contingent upon a series of coastal and environmental engineering investigations, a range of engineering actions that could mitigate erosion, navigation and sedimentation problems were considered. Based on the physical and ecological impacts that would be caused by these actions, two sets of action options that have net beneficial impacts due to action implementation have been proposed. The first is a set of interdependent action options that must be instituted inherently in a time-wise phased manner. The second is a set of independent action options which can be instituted as and when desired. For determining the overall feasibility of any action option, {{it will be necessary to}} weigh the technical benefits against costs, which are provided. It should be emphasized however that, considering the overwhelmingly observational nature of coastal science, the estimates of potential benefits are essentially and inherently subjective, and the costs very approximate, especially in cases where the desired technology is in the "bench" stage.
