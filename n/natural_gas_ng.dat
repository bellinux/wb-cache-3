In the proposed method, technology improvement, pricing mechanism, carbon tax and user's pricing response are considered. The prerequisite of the market simulation is that the heating expenses of end-users won’t increase and the benefit of heat producers won’t decrease when using NG to replace coal. Based on the obtained analysis results, gas pricing revolution, heating pricing revolution and carbon tax mechanism are discussed in order to promote the gas-fired heating through market mechanism...|$|R
