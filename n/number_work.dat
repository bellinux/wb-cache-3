5|$|During the Eastern Han, I Ching {{interpretation}} {{divided into}} two schools, originating {{in a dispute over}} minor differences between different editions of the received text. The first school, known as New Text criticism, was more egalitarian and eclectic, and sought to find symbolic and numerological parallels between the natural world and the hexagrams. Their commentaries provided the basis of the School of Images and Numbers. The other school, Old Text criticism, was more scholarly and hierarchical, and focused on the moral content of the text, providing the basis for the School of Meanings and Principles. The New Text scholars distributed alternate versions of the text and freely integrated non-canonical commentaries into their work, as well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as the Taixuanjing. Most of this early commentary, such as the image and <b>number</b> <b>work</b> of Jing Fang, Yu Fan and Xun Shuang, is no longer extant.

50|$|Drafters work in {{architectural}} offices, manufacturing companies, engineering firms, CAD-specific work-groups, construction companies, {{engineering consultancy}} firms, the government, natural resource companies or are independently self-employed. Drafting technologists and technicians often work {{as part of}} a broader multidisciplinary engineering team in support of engineers, architects or industrial designers or they may work on their own. The position of a drafter is one of a skilled assistant to architects and engineers. Drafters usually work in offices, seated at adjustable drawing boards or drafting tables when doing manual drawings, although modern drafters work at computer terminals much of the time. They usually work in an office environment, but some may have to travel and spend time on manufacturing plants or construction sites. Because they spend long periods in front of computers doing detailed technical work, drafters may be susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, and hand and wrist problems.

A number of graduates have taken up academic posts such as Tom Barker (designer) (Cohort 1), Gerrard Wood (Cohort 2), and Jennifer Barrett (Cohort 10).

She explains to Deirdre that she might be the long sought 'Bidahinne', the woman who was mentioned in a prophecy and who will bring freedom between the known world and the distant kingdom of Lure, where powerful women reign, who possess weapons much stronger than any of those known to men.An adventurous journey begins for Deirdre and the delegates of the monastery, beyond the mountains, to a mysterious land that no man of the known world has seen in millennia.|$|E
