5|$|In 1943, the Supreme Commander in the Southwest Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur, {{requested}} a Naval officer for his General Headquarters (GHQ) to replace Captain Herbert J. Ray, an {{officer who had}} escaped from the Philippines with him in 1942. Ray had been appointed to command the battleship , and Tarbuck was chosen to replace him. En route to Australia, Tarbuck met with Admiral Chester Nimitz, who told him {{in no uncertain terms}} that anti-Army and anti-MacArthur sentiments had <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> his command. As it was, Tarbuck became a loyal supporter of MacArthur.|$|E
5|$|When John Diefenbaker {{took office}} as Prime Minister of Canada on June 21, 1957, only one Progressive Conservative MP, Earl Rowe, {{had served in}} federal {{governmental}} office, {{for a brief period}} under Bennett in 1935. Rowe was no friend of Diefenbaker, and was given <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> his government. Diefenbaker appointed Ellen Fairclough as Secretary of State for Canada, the first woman to be appointed to a Cabinet post, and Michael Starr as Minister of Labour, the first Canadian of Ukrainian descent to serve in Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|After Jutland, Deutschland and {{her three}} {{surviving}} sisters returned to picket duty {{at the mouth of}} the Elbe. They were also occasionally transferred for guard duty in the Baltic. The experience at Jutland demonstrated that pre-dreadnoughts had <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> a naval battle with dreadnoughts, and they were thus left behind when the High Seas Fleet sortied again on 18 August. In July, KzS Rudolf Bartels replaced Meurer as the ship's captain; he held the position for just a month, before he was in turn replaced by Deutschlands final commander, KzS Reinhold Schmidt. In late 1916, the ships of the II Squadron were removed from the High Seas Fleet. From 22 December 1916 to 16 January 1917, Deutschland lay idle in the Bay of Kiel. On 24 January, the ship was taken to Hamburg where she went into the dry-dock for maintenance; this work lasted until 4 April. During this period in the shipyard, Deutschland had her forwardmost pair of 8.8cm guns in the aft superstructure removed and two 8.8cm guns in anti-aircraft mountings were installed.|$|E

5|$|Nickel, {{formerly}} {{used in the}} cent, now had <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> American coinage. This was unsatisfactory to Wharton, {{who sought}} its return. Although Pollock {{made no mention of}} further nickel coinage in his 1864 annual report, Wharton in April of that year published a pamphlet proposing that all non-precious metal coinage be composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel. The copper-nickel cents had contained only 12% nickel, and even so had been difficult for the Mint to strike due to the hardness of the metal, the use of which damaged equipment and quickly broke dies. An alloy of 25% nickel would be even more difficult to coin. Wharton argued that the tough alloy would be difficult to counterfeit.|$|E
5|$|Political and {{religious}} differences between old Missourians and newly-arriving Mormon settlers provoked {{tensions between the}} two groups, much as they had years earlier in Jackson County. By this time, Smith's experiences with mob violence led him to believe that his faith's survival required greater militancy against anti-Mormons. Around June 1838, recent convert Sampson Avard formed a covert organization called the Danites to intimidate Mormon dissenters and oppose anti-Mormon militia units. Though {{it is unclear how}} much Smith knew of the Danites' activities, he clearly approved of those of which he did know. After Rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the Mormon community, the Danites forcibly expelled them from the county.|$|E
5|$|Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both {{literal and}} allegorical {{acceptance}} of myth, declaring roundly that myths have <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> philosophy. Cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like Varro, he is emphatic in {{his support for}} the state religion and its institutions. It is difficult to know how far down the social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish as to believe in the terrors of Hades or the existence of Scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. De Natura Deorum is the most comprehensive summary of Cicero's line of thought.|$|E
