25|$|A 2010 study {{describing}} Belgium chiropractors {{and their}} patients found chiropractors in Belgium mostly focus on <b>neuromusculoskeletal</b> complaints in adult patients, {{with emphasis on}} the spine.

25|$|Vertebral subluxation, a core {{concept of}} {{traditional}} chiropractic, remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and {{a debate about}} whether {{to keep it in}} the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades. In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, dogmatic beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community. This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others have moved towards an evidence-based chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily <b>neuromusculoskeletal</b> conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{percentage}} of the population that utilizes chiropractic care at any given time generally falls into a range from 6% to 12% in the U.S. and Canada, with a global high of 20% in Alberta in 2006. In 2008, chiropractors were reported to be the most common CAM providers for children and adolescents, consuming up to 14% of all visits to chiropractors. In 2008, there were around 60,000 chiropractors practicing in North America. In 2002–03, the majority of those who sought chiropractic did so for relief from back and neck pain and other <b>neuromusculoskeletal</b> complaints; most do so specifically for low back pain. The majority of U.S. chiropractors participate in some form of managed care. Although the majority of U.S. chiropractors view themselves as specialists in neuroleptic malignant syndrome conditions, many also consider chiropractic as a type of primary care. In the majority of cases, the care that chiropractors and physicians provide divides the market, however for some, their care is complementary.|$|E

2500|$|Chiropractors {{emphasize}} the conservative {{management of the}} <b>neuromusculoskeletal</b> system {{without the use of}} medicines or surgery, with special emphasis on the spine. Back and neck pain are the specialties of chiropractic but many chiropractors treat ailments other than musculoskeletal issues. There is a range of opinions among chiropractors: some believed that treatment should be confined to the spine, or back and neck pain; others disagreed. For example, while one 2009 survey of American chiropractors had found that 73% classified themselves as [...] "back pain/musculoskeletal specialists", the label [...] "back and neck pain specialists" [...] was regarded by 47% of them as a least desirable description in a 2005 international survey. Chiropractic combines aspects from mainstream and alternative medicine, and there is no agreement about how to define the profession: although chiropractors have many attributes of primary care providers, chiropractic has more of the attributes of a medical specialty like dentistry or podiatry. It has been proposed that chiropractors specialize in nonsurgical spine care, instead of attempting to also treat other problems, but the more expansive view of chiropractic is still widespread.|$|E

50|$|Chiropractic {{treatment}} of vertebral subluxation focuses on delivering a chiropractic adjustment {{which is a}} high velocity low amplitude (HVLA) thrust to the dysfunctional spinal segments to help correct the chiropractic subluxation complex. Spinal adjustment is the primary procedure used by chiropractors in the adjustment. Adjustment/manipulation {{has been shown to}} help with low back pain, neck pain and tension type headaches, but further studies are inconclusive on the use of spinal manipulation outside the {{treatment of}} <b>neuromusculoskeletal</b> disorders.|$|E
50|$|Surgery is {{considered}} to be a last option when more conservative approaches fail to alleviate symptoms. Techniques such as bunionectomies may be used to surgically remove bunions and other foot and ankle deformalities, arthrodesis (or fusion of joint spaces) for inflammatory processes, and surgical reconstruction (i.e. invasive measures of manipulating <b>neuromusculoskeletal</b> structures) to treat other deformalities. Orthotics, physical therapy, NSAIDs, DMARDs and a change of shoe may act as a complement to surgical intervention, and in most cases will be required for optimal recovery.|$|E
5000|$|Representing a {{minority}} viewpoint among chiropractors that {{is shared by}} those known as reform chiropractors, the NACM advocated a highly limited use of spinal manipulative procedures [...] "only {{for the treatment of}} some <b>neuromusculoskeletal</b> conditions of musculoskeletal origin," [...] for example the treatment of [...] "sore backs and other musculo-skeletal problems." [...] By openly rejecting some of the more controversial aspects of chiropractic, including a basic concept of chiropractic, vertebral subluxations as the cause of all diseases. NACM members claimed to receive mainstream approval more so than practitioners of straight or mixing chiropractic.|$|E
50|$|Swire {{attained}} his physiotherapy qualification {{from the}} University of Salford's School of Physiotherapy in 1985, before completing a postgraduate diploma in Sports Injury, <b>Neuromusculoskeletal</b> Dysfunction and Manual Therapy and earning an MSc in Sports and Exercise. Before taking {{a job in}} football, Swire worked at a private sports injury clinic. In 1991, he was hired as an assistant physiotherapist at Manchester United, first under Jim McGregor and then under David Fevre.

50|$|Similarly, {{orthotics}} is {{the study}} of prescribing, designing and fitting supportive devises to any part of human body with any <b>neuromusculoskeletal</b> disorders and one who is expert in this science is called as an orthotist. Sometime splints are referred as orthosis (the device); they are otherwise used for a short period. Some of the pathologies where orthotists play an important role are all type of paralysis patient (hemiplegics, paraplegics, etraplegivstrieics, quadriplegics, etc.), polio myelitis, muscular dystrophy, CTEV, Cerebral Palsy, Burn injury, fractures (mainly fractures of cervical vertebrae), diabetic foot, leprosy, Perthe's disease, PID, LBP, vertebral deformities (scoliosis, kyphosis, lordosis, spondylolisthesis, etc.), phlagiocephalics, any LMN disorders, etc.|$|E
50|$|The NCAHF {{contends that}} {{chiropractic}} {{can be dangerous}} and lead to injury or permanent disability. However, the NCAHF does not categorically oppose the practice. NCAHF differentiates between chiropractors who promote what it considers good and bad chiropractic practices. The former promote methods of diagnosis and treatment which have a scientific basis. For example, NCAHF claims {{there is no scientific}} support for vertebral subluxation. Their view is that chiropractors should restrict their scope of practice to <b>neuromusculoskeletal</b> problems such as muscle spasms, strains, sprains, fatigue, imbalance of strength and flexibility, stretched or irritated nerve tissue, and so forth. Chiropractors should refer cases involving pathology to qualified medical practitioners.|$|E
50|$|There are {{currently}} more MD schools than DO schools offering medical {{training in the}} United States. However, the DO medical profession is expanding rapidly, with approximately 1 in 4 medical students now entering a DO medical school. Both DOs and MDs {{have the option to}} train and practice in any of the medical specialties and sub-specialties. One exception is the <b>Neuromusculoskeletal</b> Medicine specialty which is available to DOs who have first completed a one-year AOA-approved residency.However, in 2020, both the ACGME and the AOA residency programs will merge. Thus all DO applicants will attend an ACGME approved residency. Some former AOA residencies may apply for AOA distinction, which will yield an Osteopathic focus (OMM, etc.) to the training.|$|E
