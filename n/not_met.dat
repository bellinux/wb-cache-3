He returned to Australia empty-handed on 15 July.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, 22 African {{countries}} and Guyana boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, after their demand to have New Zealand excluded was <b>not</b> <b>met.</b> A New Zealand rugby team had toured South Africa, {{which had been}} banned from the Olympics since 1964 because of its apartheid politics. Rugby union not being an Olympic sport, the IOC declined to exclude New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|After Busch {{had spent}} six months with his uncle Kleine at Lüthorst, he {{expressed}} an aim to continue study in Munich. This request caused a rift with his father who, however, eventually funded this move; - see for comparison Busch's illustrated story of Painter Klecksel. Busch's expectations of the Munich Academy of Fine Arts were <b>not</b> <b>met.</b> His life became aimless; there were occasional return visits to Lüthorst, but contact with his parents had been broken off. In 1857 and 1858, as his position seemed to be without prospects, he contemplated emigration to Brazil to keep bees.|$|E

In alliance with Italy and smaller Axis powers, Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940 and threatened Great Britain. Reichskommissariats took control of conquered areas and a German administration was established in {{what was left of}} Poland. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, murdered in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps, or shot.|$|E

BSDcon is not FreeBSD-specific so it deals with {{the technical aspects of}} all BSD operating systems, including OpenBSD and NetBSD. In addition to BSDcon, three other annual conferences, EuroBSDCon, AsiaBSDCon and BSDCan take place in Europe, Japan and Canada respectively.|$|E

His speech was credited by the press with ending the strike. After three days of peace, the military withdrew from the city. The Indiana General Assembly met later that month and enacted Indiana's first minimum wage laws, regular working hours, workplace safety requirements, and began projects to improve the city's tenement slums.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{a railway}} between Oslo and Drammen were {{launched}} in 1864 and planning commenced two years later. This involved deciding upon {{the location of}} the stations. Although the idea of placing one at the municipal centre of Sandvika was <b>not</b> <b>met</b> with protest, there was not consensus regarding the other and both Østre Stabekk and Lysaker were proposed. The latter was selected by the municipal council because of its vicinity to the Oslofjord and being located next to a waterfall.|$|E

5|$|Tails and Amy {{infiltrate}} G.U.N.'s {{island base}} and rescue Sonic, while Eggman, Shadow and Rouge collect three Emeralds on the island.
