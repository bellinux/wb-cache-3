Most of the research has been targeted to using pulverized PCBs for bioleaching where precipitate formed during bioleaching contaminates the pulverized PCB sample and making the overall metal recovery process more complicated. In addition to that, such mixing of pulverized sample with precipitate also creates problems for the final separation of <b>non</b> <b>metallic</b> fraction of PCB sample. In the present investigation we attempted the use of large pieces of printed circuit boards instead of pulverized sample for removal of metals.

In short, • Large pieces of PCB can be used for bioleaching instead of pulverized PCB sample. • Metallic portion on PCBs can be made accessible to bacteria with prior chemical treatment of PCBs. • Complete metal removal obtained on PCB pieces of size 4  cm ×  2. 5  cm with the exception of solder traces.

40|$|Computational {{tools for}} the design of {{accelerating}} structures are in use since decades. While highly accurate methods exist for quasi two dimensional cavities, fully three dimensional modeling with high precision is still a ‘big challenge’. The most widely used computer code in this area is MAFIA, basing on the Finite Integration Theory (FIT, [1, 2]). While being well known for its robustness and reliability, MAFIA nevertheless suffers somewhat from a deficiency in being able to model very complicated 3 D-cavities including curved boundaries with high precision. In this paper we present two recently developed algo-rithms, facing this challenge within FIT: the usage of generalized non-orthogonal computational grids (NO-FIT), and the so-called Perfect Boundary Approximation (PBA) technique. Both methods represent consistent extensions of FIT, preserving all important properties as second order accuracy and stability of the transient solver. Especially the PBA technique reveals to be a highly efficient method, as it combines easy-to-use Carte-sian grids with a perfect approximation of boundaries. We compare MAFIA with the PBA technique for typi-cal accelerator components, and it turns out, that the PBA technique is more than one order of magnitude faster than the conventional method if many <b>non</b> Cartesian <b>metallic</b> boundaries appear inside the modeled structure. ...|$|R

In this contribution, results of electrical resistivity measurements between 80 K and 0. 08 K of various SmB 6 single crystalline samples are presented, analyzed and discussed.

In <b>non</b> magnetic <b>metallic</b> elements containing a small amount of manganese impurities, a magnetic interaction develops, oscillating in sign with the distance between Mn atoms.
