Saturday <b>Night</b> <b>Live</b> cast members did not enjoy working with The Land of Gorch segments. Writing assignments for The Land of Gorch sketches were given to Saturday <b>Night</b> <b>Live</b> staff as a penalty for being the least-liked among the production team. Writers generally regarded the routines as childish.|$|E

5|$|Frank Oz said The Land of Gorch {{experiment}} had its positives and negatives. Oz said {{he thought}} the routine was not a good fit for Saturday <b>Night</b> <b>Live,</b> and that the cartoon-style humor of their characters did not work well with the comedy of Saturday <b>Night</b> <b>Live,</b> much of which was initially derived from the Second City environment. Oz said he generally enjoyed working on Saturday <b>Night</b> <b>Live</b> and witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E

5|$|Bernie Brillstein, Henson's talent agent, {{helped him}} {{move away from}} working solely on {{productions}} for children. When Henson decided to engage Brillstein as his talent agent, Henson was not well known within the industry. Brillstein was an asset to Henson; his clients included Lorne Michaels and three Saturday <b>Night</b> <b>Live</b> cast members, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi. Henson wanted Muppets incorporated into Saturday <b>Night</b> <b>Live</b> {{as a way to}} expunge the popular view his characters were only for young audiences. With help from Frank Oz, Henson generated The Land of Gorch characters for use on Saturday <b>Night</b> <b>Live.</b> His new characters were featured in the television program's first season. Henson designed the conceptual framework of The Land of Gorch characters to be eccentric.|$|E
