50|$|A lamp with <b>night</b> <b>light</b> {{is often}} {{configured}} {{so that one}} of the two sockets is a medium-base socket, considered to be the Main Lamp (under the lamp shade), and the other socket is a candelabra-base socket that is the <b>night</b> <b>light</b> or decorative accent <b>light.</b> The <b>night</b> <b>light</b> is usually placed somewhere on or inside the body of the lamp. In a typical set-up, the main lamp would have a 150 W medium-base bulb, and the <b>night</b> <b>light</b> would have 7 W candelabra bulb. The operation of the switch is still the same, such that the <b>night</b> <b>light</b> comes on, then the main lamp, then both together, then it goes back to off.|$|R

50|$|Another type of 2-circuit lamp is also fairly common. This is {{the lamp}} with <b>night</b> <b>light.</b> While {{related to a}} 3-way lamp, this lamp is {{different}} from a 3-way lamp in both its intention and the parts it uses. The main intent of a lamp with <b>night</b> <b>light</b> is not to offer three levels of light, but rather to offer only two levels: a bright working light, and a very dim <b>night</b> <b>light</b> or decorative accent. Typically it does still use the 3-way 2-circuit switch. However, instead of having one 3-way socket, it uses two regular sockets.|$|R

40|$|With the {{expansion}} of human habitation near and within natural habitats, fragile eco-systems are increasingly exposed to artificial <b>night</b> <b>lighting.</b> Amphibians (particularly frogs and salamanders) are important components of many forest and aquatic ecosys-tems. Amphibians are particularly sensitive to environmental changes and, thus, are important indicators of the health of ecosystems. Amphibian populations have been declining world-wide {{as a result of}} environmental perturbations including increases in UV-B radiation (due to ozone depletion), global warming and climatic change, habitat loss and destruction, and acidification caused by acid rain. Light pollution may also con-tribute to global decline of amphibians, because many amphibians are nocturnally active or have biological rhythms regulated by light. This paper will summarize methods of conducting research designed to determine the impact of light pollution on amphibians, including laboratory experiments, field experiments, and natural (observational) studies. Laboratory experiments, in which <b>night</b> <b>lighting</b> is manipulated under controlled condi-tions, have resulted in information about changes in hormone production, growth, and metabolism resulting from the introduction of light during normal dark periods. Field experiments, in which the introduction of artificial <b>night</b> <b>lighting</b> is controlled, have provided evidence for short-term changes in activity and reproduction of amphibians in response to the additional of artificial <b>night</b> <b>lighting.</b> Natural (observational) studies have demonstrated an effect of artificial <b>night</b> <b>lighting</b> on foraging activity of toads, but few other natural studies have been conducted on amphibians. Results of all these studies demonstrate that artificial <b>night</b> <b>lighting</b> has the potential to affect foraging and breeding as well as growth and development of frogs and salamanders. Thus, artificial <b>night</b> <b>lighting</b> should be considered an additional factor that negatively impacts amphib-ian populations and {{more research is needed to}} assess the potential magnitude of such impacts on biological diversity of amphibians...|$|R

A detailed questionnaire was completed by the parents to obtain information on <b>night</b> time <b>lighting,</b> near work activity, educational and demographic factors.  RESULTS—There {{was no difference in}} myopia prevalence rates in children exposed to <b>night</b> time <b>light</b> (33. 1 %) compared with children who slept in the dark (31. 4 %) before age 2.  In addition, vitreous chamber depth was not related to <b>night</b> <b>light</b> (p= 0. 58) before age 2.  These results remained even after controlling for near work.  CONCLUSION—Myopia is not associated with <b>night</b> <b>light</b> in Asian populations. ...|$|R
