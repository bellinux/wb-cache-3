30|$|Some anesthetics {{have been}} {{described}} {{to be associated with}} AIVR because of toxicity. Cocaine might induce AIVR either through the production of myocardial ischemia or {{as a direct result of}} ion channel alterations [3, 9]. Halothane was reported to be associated with AIVR due to a depressant effect on slow inward calcium current and intracellular calcium accumulation [4]. Desflurane was also reported to induce AIVR because of a sympathetic imbalance [5]. Propofol was publicized to be associated with arrhythmias in humans [10]. In the guinea pig heart, the ionic mechanism underlying the negative chronotropic action of propofol on sinoatrial node (SN) automaticity was associated with propofol-induced bradycardia observed in clinical settings [11]. Similar to propofol, remifentanil also depresses sinus node function and most parameters of atrioventricular (AV) <b>nodal</b> <b>function,</b> causing remifentanil-related severe bradyarrhythmias [12].

Intravenous nifedipine 7. 5 micrograms/kg reduced both systolic blood pressure and left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) transiently; both values were significantly lower five and 10 minutes after the infusion of nifedipine but were not significantly different from control values at 20 minutes. There was minimal but pronounced depression of atrioventricular <b>nodal</b> <b>function</b> after giving intravenous nifedipine, though this was detected only when sensitive tests of atrioventricular <b>nodal</b> <b>function</b> were used. These effects were also transient, showing no significant change from control values at 20 minutes. Atrioventricular nodal conduction time and sinus rate were unchanged. Radionuclide angiography of patients taking the oral combination of atenolol and nifedipine for chronic angina showed no change in ejection fraction compared with those taking atenolol alone, but there was a small increase in peak ejection rate. Resting blood pressure and heart rate were unchanged and the PR interval did not lengthen. Peak heart rate and systolic blood pressure showed no alteration on exercise testing when the drugs were combined compared with the response with atenolol alone. Despite the negative inotropic influence when nifedipine was given intravenously, the absence of haemodynamic deterioration when oral nifedipine is combined with atenolol has confirmed that this combination can be used safely in patients with normal left ventricular function.

It {{is based on}} the local use of radial basis functions and represents a further improvement of the well known Shepard's method. Although the latter is simple and well suited for multivariate interpolation, it does not share the good reproduction quality of other methods widely used for bivariate interpolation. On the other hand, radial basis functions, which have proven to be highly useful for multivariate scattered data interpolation, have a severe drawback. They are unable to interpolate large sets in an efficient and numerically stable way and maintain a good level of reproduction quality at the same time. Both problems have been circumvented using radial basis functions to evaluate the <b>nodal</b> <b>function</b> of the modified Shepard's method.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{effects of}} {{acetylcholine}} (ACh) on sinus node automaticity, atrio-sinus conduction, and refractoriness were studied in 41 isolated rabbit right atrial preparations. Average control rate was 126 beats/min, and ACh 5 x 10 ~ 8 M, 5 x 10 " ' M, and 5 x 10 " ' M significantly decreased heart rate by 7, 15, and 43 %, respectively (P < 0. 01, 0. 001, and 0. 001). Atrio-sinus conduction {{time at a}} pacing cycle length of 400 msec did not significantly change during exposure to ACh 5 x 10 " 8 and 5 x 10 ~ 7 M. However, the mean effective refractory period (ERP) of the sinus node, at a pacing cycle length of 400 msec, increased from 183 ± 16 msec to 210 ± 24 msec during exposure to ACh 5 x 10 " ' M (P< 0. 025). The change in ERP followed the change in action potential duration. In contrast {{to the lack of}} effect of ACh 5 x 10 " 7 M on atrio-sinus conduction time, ACh 5 x 10 ~ 6 M caused 2 : 1 atrio-sinus block in 8 of 10 experiments. The site of block was identified using multiple microelectrode impalements, and occurred between the perinodal fibers bordering {{on the edge of the}} sinus node and the pacemaker area in the sinus node proper. When the pacing cycle length was increased and 1 : 1 atrio-sinus conduction was present, conduction time did not significantly differ from control. At this longer pacing cycle length the mean ERP of the sinus node was 380 msec greater than control and lasted well after repolarization was completed. Thus, atrio-sinus block during exposure to ACh 5 x 10 ~ 6 M resulted from a marked prolongation of refractoriness.
