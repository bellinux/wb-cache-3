5|$|Before Crisis was {{the first}} {{original}} video game developed by Square Enix exclusively for mobile phones, originally released on NTT DoCoMo's FOMA mobile devices, and the first action role-playing game exclusive to the platform. The company's first major mobile title, also in collaboration with NTT DoCoMo, was a remake of the original Final Fantasy. Using {{lessons learned from the}} development of the Final Fantasy port, the team worked hard to make Before Crisis a uniquely mobile experience, with gameplay features built to exploit mobile functions such as the camera and <b>network</b> <b>capacity.</b> The camera function used to generate Materia was based on a simple image recognition that specifies the Materia generated based on the picture's general color. One of the challenges during development was to keep the framerate smooth during moments of high action, especially as no two mobiles would have identical components. In addition to these problems were issues with integrating the multiplayer functions, balancing the gameplay for different playstyles, creating a comfortable button layout, and adjusting the amount of content they could include for mobiles while maintaining the desired product quality.|$|E

25|$|Where {{the network}} has reached capacity, large {{individual}} load users can be decoupled from the hot feed pipe, say 80˚C and coupled to the return pipe, at e.g. 40˚C. By adding a heat pump locally to this user, the 40˚C pipe is cooled further (the heat being delivered into the heat pump evaporator). The output from the heat pump is then a dedicated loop for the user at 40˚C to 70˚C. Therefore, the overall <b>network</b> <b>capacity</b> has changed as the total temperature difference of the loop has varied from 80–40˚C to 80˚C–x (x being a value lower than 40˚C).|$|E
25|$|Pyridine {{is used as}} {{a solvent}} in the {{manufacture}} of dyes and rubber. It is also used in the textile industry to improve <b>network</b> <b>capacity</b> of cotton. Pyridine is added to ethanol to make it unsuitable for drinking. In low doses, pyridine is added to foods to give them a bitter flavor, and such usage is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The detection threshold for pyridine in solutions is about 1–3mmol·L−1 (79–237mg·L−1). As a base, pyridine can be used as the Karl Fischer reagent, but it is usually replaced by alternatives with a more pleasant odor, such as imidazole.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, an Irregular Distributed Space-Time (Ir-DST) {{coding scheme}} is {{studied in the}} context of a twin-relay aided network in which the {{successive}} relaying protocol is employed. A tight upper-bound of the successive relaying aided <b>network’s</b> <b>capacity</b> is given. The distributed codes at the source and relays are jointly designed with the aid of EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts for the sake of high-integrity operation at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) close to the corresponding <b>network’s</b> <b>capacity.</b> Finally, it is shown that our proposed Ir-DST coding scheme is capable of near-capacity cooperative communications in the successive relaying aided network, which is an explicit benefit of our joint source-and-relay mode design.

25|$|For {{ensuring}} efficient follow-up and coherence {{in pursuing}} the initiatives and processes, for sharing information {{in case of}} an external energy crisis, and for assisting the EU's early response and reactions in case of energy security threats, the network of energy correspondents in the Member States was established in early 2007. After the Russian-Ukrainian Gas Crisis of 2009 the EU decided that the existing external measures regarding gas supply security should be supplemented by internal provisions for emergency prevention and response, such as enhancing gas storage and <b>network</b> <b>capacity</b> or the development of the technical prerequisites for reverse flow in transit pipelines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Network</b> <b>capacity</b> – According to Gerry/Gerald Butters, {{the former}} head of Lucent's Optical Networking Group at Bell Labs, there is another version, called Butters' Law of Photonics, a {{formulation}} that deliberately parallels Moore's law. Butters' law says that the amount of data coming out of an optical fiber is doubling every nine months. Thus, the cost of transmitting a bit over an optical network decreases by half every nine months. The availability of wavelength-division multiplexing (sometimes called WDM) increased the capacity that could be placed on a single fiber by as much as a factor of 100. Optical networking and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) is rapidly bringing down the cost of networking, and further progress seems assured. As a result, the wholesale price of data traffic collapsed in the dot-com bubble. Nielsen's Law says that the bandwidth available to users increases by 50% annually.|$|E

[...] The complaint stated that Comcast's actions violated the FCC Internet Policy Statement, particularly violating the statement's principle that “consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice... to run applications and use services of their choice.” [...] Comcast defended its interference with consumers' peer-to-peer programs as necessary to manage scarce <b>network</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} <b>network</b> coding <b>capacity</b> for random {{wireless}} networks. Previous work on <b>network</b> coding <b>capacity</b> for wired and wireless networks {{have focused on}} the case where the capacities of links in the network are independent. In this paper, we consider a more realistic model, where wireless networks are modeled by random geometric graphs with interference and noise. In this model, the capacities of links are not independent. We consider two scenarios, single source multiple destinations and multiple sources multiple destinations. In the first scenario, employing coupling and martingale methods, we show that the <b>network</b> coding <b>capacity</b> for random wireless networks still exhibits a concentration behavior around the mean value of the minimum cut under some mild conditions. Furthermore, we establish upper and lower bounds on the <b>network</b> coding <b>capacity</b> for dependent and independent nodes. In the second one, we also show that the <b>network</b> coding <b>capacity</b> still follows a concentration behavior. Our simulation results confirm our theoretical predictions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{cellular}} systems using {{frequency division}} duplex, growing Internet services cause unbalance of uplink and downlink traffic, resulting in poor uplink spectrum utilization. Addressing this issue, this paper considers overlaying {{an ad hoc}} network onto a cellular uplink network for improving spectrum utilization and spatial reuse efficiency. Transmission capacities of the overlaid networks are analyzed, which are defined as the maximum densities of the ad hoc nodes and mobile users under an outage constraint. Using tools from stochastic geometry, the capacity tradeoff curves for the overlaid networks are shown to be linear. Deploying overlaid networks based on frequency separation is proved to achieve higher <b>network</b> <b>capacities</b> than that based on spatial separation. Furthermore, spatial diversity is shown to enhance <b>network</b> <b>capacities.</b> I...|$|R
2500|$|On average, Communications service {{providers}} utilize {{an average of}} just 35 to 40 percent of available <b>network</b> <b>capacity.</b> Recently, telecommunications software vendors such as Telcordia and Ericsson have promoted yield management as a strategy for communications {{service providers}} to generate additional revenue and reduce capital expenditures by maximizing subscriber use of available network bandwidth. Approaches include basing a strategy on innovative services explicitly designed to use only spare capacity and borrowing proven methods from the airline industry. The approach can {{be more difficult to}} implement in the telecommunications industry than the airlines sector because of the difficulty to control and sometimes refuse network access to customers. Similarities that exist between the airline and telecom industries include a large sunk cost combined with low marginal cost, perishable inventory, reservations, pricing flexibility and the opportunity to upsell. Differences that present challenges for communications service providers include low-value transactions and overall network complexity. Suggested approaches to executing a successful yield management strategy include accurate network information collection, bandwidth capacity allocation that doesn’t impact service quality, the deployment of service management software such as real time policy and real-time charging, and using new marketing channels to target consumers [...] with innovative services.|$|E
