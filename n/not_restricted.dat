5|$|At {{certain times}} in the {{geological}} past, corals were very abundant. Like modern corals, these ancestors built reefs, some of which ended as great structures in sedimentary rocks. Fossils of fellow reef-dwellers algae, sponges, {{and the remains of}} many echinoids, brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, and trilobites appear along with coral fossils. This makes some corals useful index fossils. Coral fossils are <b>not</b> <b>restricted</b> to reef remnants, and many solitary fossils may be found elsewhere, such as Cyclocyathus, which occurs in England's Gault clay formation.|$|E

Females mate primarily with males with whom they had affiliative relations prior to mating season, although some matings occurred with roaming males from other communities.|$|E

It was once thought that the technique was restricted to the New World, but Old World species, such as the Arabian woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker, also feed in this way.|$|E

Ten hyperactive children, nine boys and one girl, were matched on their pre-treatment activity rates and assigned to either a salicylate-restricted diet (Group I) or a diet <b>not</b> <b>restricting</b> salicylates (Group II). After approximately nine weeks, post-treatment activity rates were obtained, and {{a significant difference in}} favor of the salicylate-restricted diet group was found with this diet group exhibiting a significantly lower mean post-treatment activity rate in comparison to the group placed on a diet <b>not</b> <b>restricting</b> salicylates (p<. 05). Implications for diagnosis and treatment of hyperactivity in children were discussed...|$|R
