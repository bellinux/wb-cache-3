New localities for both species, comments on on the behaviour and data about the habitats used by the <b>Neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otter were obtained. The information about distribution was completed by an examination of records from zoological collections and literature.

40|$|A ariranha (Pteronura brasiliensis) e a lontra neotropical (Lontra longicaudis) são duas espécies de carnívoros mustelídeos pertencentes à subfamília Lutrinae, que se alimentam principalmente de peixes. Essas duas espécies coexistem no Parque Nacional do Jaú, na Amazônia Central brasileira, sendo que a suposta semelhança na dieta poderia gerar interações ecológicas importantes entre elas. O presente trabalho visou caracterizar e comparar as dietas de ariranhas e lontras no trecho {{inferior}} dos rios Jaú e Carabinani, por meio da análise de amostras fecais coletadas entre os anos de 2006 e 2008 (82 de ariranhas e 75 de lontras). A maior parte das amostras (cerca de 85 %) foram obtidas durante a seca, o que restringiu o alcance da interpretação dos resultados a esse período do ciclo hidrológico. A ariranha se alimentou principalmente de peixes das famílias Cichlidae (Frequência de ocorrência= 91, 5 %), Erythrinidae (74, 4 %) e Characidae (29, 3 %), enquanto que a lontra consumiu principalmente peixes das famílias Doradidae (75, 3 %), Loricariidae (26, 7 %) e Cichlidae (25, 3 %). As duas espécies apresentaram baixa similaridade na dieta (Índice de Pianka= 0, 16), o que possivelmente reflete o uso de diferentes microhabitats e táticas de forrageamento e à grande abundância e riqueza de peixes na Amazônia. A ariranha captura peixes maiores e mais ativos (por exemplo, anostomídeos e grandes caracídeos) do que a lontra, a qual provavelmente vasculha o substrato em trechos rasos de rios em busca de peixes mais lentos, de hábitos sedentários ou noturnos (principalmente pequenos bagres). Outras presas que não peixes (répteis, roedores e macroinvertebrados aquáticos), apesar de pouco comuns na dieta de ambas as espécies, foram mais frequentes na alimentação da lontra do que na da ariranha. Além disso, as ariranhas consumiram peixes de uma maior diversidade de famílias do que a lontra. Neste sentido, a lontra parece ser mais especializada na captura de certos tipos de peixes, mostrando nítida preferência pelo consumo de pequenos bagres da família Doradidae. Os resultados obtidos indicam pequena sobreposição na dieta, porém sem indicação de interações tróficas significativas entre ariranhas e lontras no Parque Nacional do Jaú. The {{giant otter}} (Pteronura brasiliensis) and the <b>neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otter (Lontra longicaudis) are {{two species of}} carnivorous mustelids belonging to the Lutrinae subfamily, which feed mainly on fish. These two species coexist in the Jaú National Park, in Central Brazilian Amazon, and the supposed similarity in the diet could generate interactions between them. This study describes and compares the diets of the giant otter and the <b>neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otter in the lower Jaú and Carabinani rivers, through the analyses of fecal samples collected between 2006 and 2008 (82 giant otter and 75 <b>neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otter). About 85 % of the samples were collected during the dry season, which limited the analyses to the low water period. The giant otter feeds mainly on fish of the Cichlidae (frequency of occurrence = 91. 5 %), Erythrinidae (74. 4 %) and Characidae (29. 3 %) families, while the <b>neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otter consumed mainly fish of the Doradidae (75. 3 %), Loricariidae (26. 7 %) and Cichlidae (25. 3 %) families. The two otter species showed low similarity in their diets (Pianka’s Index = 0. 16), which possibly reflects the use of different microhabitats and foraging tactics and the abundance and richness of fish in the Amazon. The giant otter catch larger and more active fish (eg. anostomids and large characins) than the <b>neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otter, which probably scans the substrate in shallow river parts in search of slower, sedentary and nocturnal (mainly small catfish) fish. Other than fish prey (reptiles, rodents and aquatic invertebrates), although uncommon in the diet of both otter species, were more frequent in the diet of the <b>neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otter that in the giant otter. Moreover, the giant otter ate a greater diversity of fish families than the <b>neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otter. In this sense, the <b>neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otter {{seems to be more}} specialized in capturing certain types of fish, showing a clear preference for the consumption of small catfish of the Doradidae family. The results indicate litter overlap in the diet, but no indication of trophic interaction between giant otters and <b>neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otters in Jaú National Park...|$|R

50|$|An extinct genus, Satherium, is {{believed}} to be ancestral to South American river otters, having migrated to the New World during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. The South American continent houses the Lontra genus of otters: the giant otter, the <b>neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otter, the southern river otter, and the marine otter.

40|$|There {{are very}} few studies on <b>Neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otters (Lontra longicaudis) in Uruguay. However, the species is {{nowadays}} considered to be fairly common in the country. This paper reports on its distribution and current conservation status in the Uruguayan Atlantic basin. It provides some information on activity patterns, diet, and interactions with fishermen. The presence of otters was evaluated through interviews with fishermen and local people, and through field surveys in 1999 and 2000. Otter presence was recorded in every lagoon and tributary surveyed. Local people consider that <b>Neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otters are currently more abundant than they were 10 years ago. This recovery is probably the consequence of the ceasing of commercial hunting. Otters are both day and night active, though foraging takes place more during the night. All year round, otters are frequently seen in small groups, which may indicate {{that they are more}} social than generally thought. Most of the dietary items recorded were fish and crustaceans, but preying on mammals, birds, and reptiles were also recorded. Interactions of otters with fishermen go far beyond preying on fish trapped in nets. Local fishermen do not perceive these animals as competitors, but as sympathetic companions...|$|R

40|$|Aquatic and semiaquatic mammals {{have the}} {{capacity}} of breath hold (apnea) diving. Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{have the ability to}} perform deep and long duration dives; during a routine dive, adults can hold their breath for 25 min. <b>Neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otters (Lontra longicaudis annectens) can hold their breath for about 30 sec. Such periods of apnea may result in reduced oxygen concentration (hypoxia) and reduced blood supply (ischemia) to tissues. Production of adenosine 5 ’-triphosphate (ATP) requires oxygen, and most mammalian species, like the domestic pig (Sus scrofa), are not adapted to tolerate hypoxia and ischemia, conditions that result in ATP degradation. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore the differences in purine synthesis and recycling in erythrocytes and plasma of three mammalian species adapted to different environments: aquatic (northern elephant seal) (n= 11), semiaquatic (<b>neotropical</b> <b>river</b> otter) (n= 4) and terrestrial (domestic pig) (n= 11). Enzymatic activity of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) was determined by spectrophotometry, and activity of inosine 5 ’-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and the concentration of hypoxanthine (HX), inosine 5 ’-monophosphate (IMP), adenosine 5 ’-monophosphate (AMP), adenosine 5 ’-diphosphate (ADP), ATP, guanosine 5 ’-diphosphate (GDP), guanosine 5 ’-triphosphate (GTP), and xanthosine 5 ’-monophosphate (XMP) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The activities of HGPRT and IMPDH and the concentration of HX, IMP, AMP, ADP, ATP, GTP and XMP in erythrocytes of domestic pigs were higher than in erythrocytes of northern elephant seals and river otters.
