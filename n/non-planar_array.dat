40|$|We {{present a}} {{portable}} four-channel atomic magnetometer array {{operating in the}} spin exchange relaxation-free regime. The magnetometer array has several design features intended to maximize its suitability for biomagnetic measurement, specifically foetal magnetocardiography, such as a compact modular design, and fibre coupled lasers. The modular design allows the independent positioning and orientation of each magnetometer, in principle allowing for <b>non-planar</b> <b>array</b> geometries. Using this array in a magnetically shielded room, we acquire adult magnetocadiograms. These measurements were taken with a 6 - 11 fT Hz^(- 1 / 2) single-channel baseline sensitivity {{that is consistent with}} the independently measured noise level of the magnetically shielded room.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} precise and fast {{direction}} of arrival estimation method using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) carrier phase measurements. Single-epoch, single-satellite integer cycle ambiguities are reliably resolved by {{making use of}} constraints and taking advantages of antenna arrays. The algorithm shows good robustness in cases where signal interruption or corruption occurs on some antenna elements as long as four antenna elements in a <b>non-planar</b> <b>array</b> have uncorrupted observables. The algorithm is demonstrated by field tests where antenna elements are connected to multiple receivers with an external common clock. The results indicate a high success rate of single-epoch ambiguity resolution and high direction of arrival accuracy. Space EngineeringAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|This book {{presents}} electromagnetic (EM) {{design and}} analysis of dipole antenna array over high impedance substrate (HIS). HIS is a preferred substrate for low-profile antenna design, owing to its unique boundary conditions. Such substrates permit radiating elements to be printed on them without any disturbance in the radiation characteristics. Moreover HIS provides improved impedance matching, enhanced bandwidth, and increased broadside directivity owing to total reflection from the reactive surface and high input impedance. This book considers different configurations of HIS for array design on planar and non-planar high-impedance surfaces. Results are presented for cylindrical dipole, printed dipole, and folded dipole over single- and double-layered square-patch-based HIS and dogbone-based HIS. The performance of antenna arrays is analyzed in terms of performance parameters such as return loss and radiation pattern. The design presented shows acceptable return loss and mainlobe gain of radiation pattern. This book provides an insight to EM design {{and analysis of}} conformal arrays. This book serves as an introduction for beginners {{in the design and}} analysis of HIS-based antenna arrays. It includes pictorial description of both planar and <b>non-planar</b> <b>array</b> design and the detailed discussion of the performance analysis of HIS-based planar and non-planar antenna array. It will prove useful to researchers and professionals, alike...|$|E
40|$|The source {{localization}} algorithms in {{the earlier}} works, mostly used non-planar arrays. If we consider scenarios like human-computer communication, or human-television communication where the microphones need {{to be placed on}} the computer monitor or television front panel, i. e we need to use the planar arrays. The algorithm proposed in 1], is a Linear Closed Form source localization algorithm (LCF algorithm) which is based on Time Difference of Arrivals (TDOAs) that are obtained from the data collected using the microphones. It assumes non-planar arrays. The LCF algorithm is applied to planar arrays in the current work. The relationship between the error in the source location estimate and the perturbation in the TDOAs is derived using first order perturbation analysis and validated using simulations. If the TDOAs are erroneous, both the coefficient matrix and the data matrix used for obtaining source location will be perturbed. So, the Total least squares solution for source localization is proposed in the current work. The sensitivity analysis of the source localization algorithm for planar arrays and non-planar arrays is done by introducing perturbation in the TDOAs and the microphone locations. It is shown that the error in the source location estimate is less when we use planar array instead of the particular <b>non-planar</b> <b>array</b> considered for same perturbation in the TDOAs or microphone location. The location of the reference microphone is proved to be important for getting an accurate source location estimate if we are using the LCF algorithm...|$|E
3000|$|Our {{ability to}} {{determine}} the direction-of-arrival of a transmitted signal via antenna arrays has improved dramatically in recent years. The invention of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariant techniques (ESPRIT) algorithms enabled performance exceeding the resolution limit prescribed by the array dimensions (so-called [...] "super-resolution"). Applications include localization and tracking of airborne, undersea, or ground-based targets, civilian search and rescue operations, emergency caller location via cell towers, precision aircraft navigation and landing, characterization and modeling of spatial/temporal channels, and future location-based services in cellular networks. Angle estimation becomes especially challenging when multipath, interference, array miscalibration, or source correlation is encountered. Most textbook treatments of this topic cover only one-dimensional (1 D) angle estimation, implying that the source's movement {{takes place in the}} plane of the array. The extension to two-dimensional (2 D) AOA (azimuth and elevation) is not only necessary for many real-world applications, but introduces new problems and challenges that do not occur in the 1 D case. Furthermore, angular measurements may be combined with other modalities, such as Doppler, delay, delay-difference, polarization, received power, etc., necessitating a multi-dimensional (M-D) approach to direction-finding, location determination, or parametric MIMO channel modeling. Relevant problems involve so-called [...] "pair matching" [...] or [...] "parameter association" [...] between sets of independently obtained arrival angles or other parameters, complexity reduction in approaches requiring M-D search, and <b>non-planar</b> <b>array</b> design. Furthermore, the above techniques and problems can be applied to radar, acoustic localization, and nuclear magnetic resonance or acoustic imaging.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} novel {{idea of using}} {{evolutionary}} algorithms to optimise control and design aspects of active array antenna systems. Active arrays differ from most mechanically scanned antennas in that they offer {{the ability to control}} the shape of their radiation pattern. As active arrays consist of a multiplicity of transmit and receive modules (TRMs), the task of optimally controlling them in order to generate a desired radiation pattern becomes difficult. The control problem is especially true of conformal (<b>non-planar)</b> <b>array</b> antennas that require additional phase control to achieve good radiation pattern performance. This thesis describes a number of significant advances in the optimisation of array antenna performance. Firstly a genetic algorithm (GA) is shown to be effective at optimising both planar and conformal antenna performance. A number of examples are used to illustrate and promote the basic optimisation concept. Secondly, in this thesis the techniques are advanced to apply multiobjective evolutionary optimisation algorithms to array performance optimisation. It is shown that Evolutionary Algorithms allow users to simultaneously optimise many aspects of array performance without the need to fine-tune a large number of weights. The multiple-objective analysis methods shown demonstrate the advantages to be gained by holding knowledge of the Pareto optimal solution set. Thirdly, this thesis examines the problems of optimising the design of large (many element) array antennas. Larger arrays are often divided into smaller sub-arrays for manufacturing reasons and to promote formation of difference beam patterns for monopulse operation. In the past, the partitioning has largely been left to trial-and-error or simple randomisation techniques. This thesis describes a new and novel approach for optimally subdividing both planar and conformal array antennas as well as improving gain patterns in a single optimisation process. This approach contains a new method of partitioning array antennas, inspired from a biological process and is also presented and optimised using evolutionary algorithms. Additionally, the technique can be applied to any size or shape of array antenna, with the processing load dependent on the number of subarrays, rather than the number of elements. Finally, the success of these new techniques is demonstrated by presenting a range of performance optimised examples of planar and conformal array antenna installations including examples of optimally evolved subarray partitions...|$|E
