40|$|Abstract: The {{reasons why}} it is {{effective}} to estimate the chlorophyll-a concentration with the ratio of spectral radiance reflectance at the red light <b>region</b> and <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>regions</b> were shown in theory using a two-flow model.

In addition, the band selection is crucial for producing the band ratio when the chlorophyll-a concentration is estimated without the effects of backscattering.

5000|$|Early in the 20th century, {{there was}} {{vigorous}} {{debate over whether}} candoluminescence is required to explain the behavior of Welsbach gas mantles or limelight. One counterargument was that since thorium oxide (for example) has much lower emissivity in the <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>region</b> than the shorter wavelength parts of the visible spectrum, {{it should not be}} strongly cooled by infrared radiation, and thus a thorium oxide mantle can get closer to the flame temperature than can a blackbody material.

50|$|Many {{scanners}} use {{an additional}} infrared channel to detect defects, as the long wave infrared radiation {{passes through the}} film but not through dust particles.

Kodachrome also has a pronounced relief image that can affect the infrared channel. These effects can sometimes cause a slight loss of sharpness in the scanned image when Digital ICE or a similar infrared channel dust removal function is used.|$|E

50|$|The {{absorption}} and fluorescence {{spectrum of}} ICG {{is in the}} <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>region.</b> Both depend largely on the solvent used and the concentration. ICG absorbs mainly between 600 nm and 900 nm and emits fluorescence between 750 nm and 950 nm. The large overlapping of the absorption and fluorescence spectra leads to a marked reabsorption of the fluorescence by ICG itself. The fluorescence spectrum is very wide. Its maximum values are approx. 810 nm in water and approx. 830 nm in blood. For medical applications based on absorption, the maximum absorption at approx. 800 nm (in blood plasma at low concentrations) is important. In combination with fluorescence detection, lasers with a wavelength of around 780 nm are used. At this wavelength, {{it is still possible}} to detect the fluorescence of ICG by filtering out scattered light from the excitation beam.|$|E
50|$|The {{fluorophore}} absorbs {{light energy}} of a specific wavelength and re-emits light at a longer wavelength. The absorbed wavelengths, energy transfer efficiency, and time before emission depend on both the fluorophore structure and its chemical environment, as the molecule in its excited state interacts with surrounding molecules. Wavelengths of maximum absorption (≈ excitation) and emission (for example, Absorption/Emission = 485 nm/517 nm) are the typical terms {{used to refer to}} a given fluorophore, but the whole spectrum may be important to consider. The excitation wavelength spectrum may be a very narrow or broader band, or it may be all beyond a cutoff level. The emission spectrum is usually sharper than the excitation spectrum, and it is of a longer wavelength and correspondingly lower energy. Excitation energies range from ultraviolet through the visible spectrum, and emission energies may continue from visible light into the <b>near</b> <b>infrared</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
