40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Narasin</b> is a {{polyether}} {{monocarboxylic acid}} antibiotic produced by Streptomyces aureofaciens. An extensive series of battery cage trials {{was conducted to}} evaluate the efficacy of <b>narasin</b> against recent field isolates of the pathogenic species of chicken coccidia. Statistical analyses {{of the results of}} these studies revealed that each successive increase in the concentration of <b>narasin</b> produced a significant reduction in the severity of cecal and intestinal lesions when compared with those in infected nonmedicated controls. Increasing the concentration of <b>narasin</b> also produced significant improvements in weight gain and feed efficiency when compared to gain and feed efficiency of infected nonmedicated controls. Maximum weight gain of birds infected with Eimeria tenella alone was obtained at a <b>narasin</b> concentration of 60 ppm, but birds infected with E. tenella plus intestinal species of coccidia, when medicated with 80 ppm <b>narasin</b> had weight gains significantly greater than those of birds medicated with 60 ppm <b>narasin.</b> Weight gain improvement decreased at <b>narasin</b> concentrations & 100 ppm. Results of these studies confirm the effectiveness of <b>narasin</b> in controlling coccidial infections produced by recent field isolates of the pathogenic species of chicken coccidia...|$|E

Eggs were collected during trial days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21 and after the withdrawal period of 7 days. The concentration of <b>narasin</b> in yolks and egg whites was analyzed by a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. <b>Narasin</b> was found to accumulate in yolks, where the <b>narasin</b> concentration increased during the treatment. The concentration of <b>narasin</b> varied from 5. 9 to 13. 8 g/kg (mean 10. 6 g/kg) in yolks after 21 day feeding periods. The concentrations of <b>narasin</b> ranged from < 0. 9 to 1. 4 g/kg after the withdrawal period. <b>Narasin</b> residues were not found in egg whites of the laying hens fed contaminated feed nor in either yolks or egg whites of the laying hens fed unmedicated feed. The effect of cooking was also tested on the amount of <b>narasin</b> residues in eggs. Cooking for 10 min did not significantly influence the <b>narasin</b> residues in eggs.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} {{supplemental}} <b>narasin</b> (80 mg/kg) on several dietary factors were investigated in chicks infected with Eimeria acervulina. In Trial 1, chicks were fed a lysine-deficient corn-corn gluten meal diet containing graded increments of crystalline L-lysine-HCl {{with or without}} <b>narasin.</b> Supplemental <b>narasin</b> increased weight gain and feed efficiency at all lysine levels fed. Based upon slope-ratio methodology, efficiency of L-lysine utilization was virtually the same in both narasin-fed and control chicks. Trials 2 and 3 evaluated the effect of <b>narasin</b> on methionine utilization in crossbred chicks fed a methionine-deficient soy-feather meal diet supplemented with graded levels of DL-methionine. <b>Narasin</b> supplementation increased weight gain, feed efficiency, and utilization of supplemental methionine in chicks infected with E. acervulina (Trial 2), but {{had no effect on}} any of the performance parameters in uninfected chicks (Trial 3). The effects of dietary protein level and source and dietary electrolyte balance on the <b>narasin</b> response of commercial broiler chicks infected with E. acervulina were studied in Trials 4 and 5, respectively. In Trial 4, <b>narasin</b> supplementation increased performance in all cases, and protein source or level had no effect on the <b>narasin</b> response. In Trial 5, rate and efficiency of gain were improved as the electrolyte balance (meq Na + K-Cl/kg diet) increased from 100 to 250, with no further improvement being observed from 250 to 350 meq.

40|$|Background/Aims: <b>Narasin,</b> an {{ionophore}} {{used for}} the treatment of coccidiosis, has been shown to foster apoptosis of tumor cells. In analogy to apoptosis of nucleated cells, erythrocytes may enter eryptosis, the suicidal erythrocyte death characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the erythrocyte surface. Eryptosis may be triggered by Ca 2 + entry with subsequent increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity ([Ca 2 +]i), and by ceramide. The present study explored, whether and how <b>narasin</b> induces eryptosis. Methods: Flow cytometry was employed to estimate phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface from annexin-V-binding, cell volume from forward scatter, [Ca 2 +]i from Fluo 3 -fluorescence, and ceramide abundance utilizing specific antibodies. Results: A 48 hours exposure of human erythrocytes to <b>narasin</b> (10 and 25 ng/ml) significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells.

40|$|Animal {{production}} systems {{are an important}} source of anthropogenic methane emissions. Production of methane results from microbial activity by anaerobic bacteria populations within the stored manure that breaks down organic material and converts it to biogas. Swine manures obtained from three deep pit storages in Central Iowa were dosed with <b>Narasin,</b> an ionophore, to evaluate its inhibitory effects on methane and biogas production. Four <b>Narasin</b> dosing rates were evaluated, these included 0 (Control), 7. 5, 15, and 30 mg Narasin/kg of manure. Overall, the results indicated that <b>Narasin</b> had an inhibitory effect on methane and biogas production, with greater inhibition being seen at higher dosing rates. The inhibitory effect weakened with time such that after 120 days of incubation there was no statistical difference in cumulative methane production between samples dosed with <b>Narasin</b> and the control. Two additional treatments, based on the addition of an easily available carbohydrate, sugar, were also evaluated. Sugar (10 g per kg of manure) was added to manure both with (15 mg Narasin/kg) and without (0 mg Narasin/kg manure) <b>Narasin</b> amendment. The addition of sugar was performed to evaluate the impact an easily available substrate had on the inhibitory effects of <b>Narasin.</b> The results suggested that methane production was initially increased by the addition of sugar, but that the increased methane production lasted for less than 6 days, at which point cumulative methane production was similar to the control. When treated with both <b>Narasin</b> and sugar the inhibitory effect did not impact the gas production during the sugar digestion phase, but did result in reduced methane and biogas production thereafter. Overall the results indicated that <b>Narasin</b> can be an effective pit additive but further study is needed to recommend dosing frequency and to evaluate how the continuous addition of manure impacts <b>Narasin</b> effectiveness. Thus, this paper will describe a scaled up lab experiment that will be used to evaluate the effect of dosing frequency of <b>Narasin</b> to determine how producers could most effectively use it at the farm scale...|$|E
40|$|The {{depletion}} {{times of}} the anticoccidial nicarbazin administered individually and of nicarbazin and <b>narasin</b> administered in combination were evaluated by determining the presence and levels of 4, 4 '-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC), the marker residue for nicarbazin, and <b>narasin</b> residues in the muscle tissues of broiler chickens subjected to a pharmacological treatment. A high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was used. The results showed the presence of all anticoccidial residues; however, the DNC levels were higher when the nicarbazin was administered individually than when it was used in association with <b>narasin</b> throughout the experimental period. After six days of withdrawal, the DNC level following nicarbazin administration alone was lower than the maximum residue level (MRL) of 200 μg kg- 1. However, when the nicarbazin was co-administered with <b>narasin,</b> the concentrations of DNC were lower than the MRL after four days of withdrawal. These results may be justified because the dosage of nicarbazin, when administrated individually, is greater than when it is used in combination with <b>narasin.</b> The levels of <b>narasin</b> were lower than the MRL of 15 μg kg- 1 throughout the evaluation period. It was concluded that nicarbazin is rapidly metabolized from the broiler muscles up to six days of withdrawal since the DNC levels were lower than the maximum residue level (MRL) and the concentrations of <b>narasin</b> were lower than the MRL throughout the evaluation period...|$|E

The ionophore anticoccidials lasalocid, salinomycin, maduramicin, <b>narasin</b> and {{a combination of}} <b>narasin</b> and nicarbazin were tested in feed for their prophylactic effect on the incidence of necrotic enteritis in a subclinical experimental infection model that uses coccidia as predisposing factor. In addition, drinking water medication with the antibiotics amoxicillin, tylosin and lincomycin was evaluated as curative treatment in the same experimental model. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of all antibiotics and anticoccidials were determined in vitro against 51 C. perfringens strains isolated from broilers. The strains examined appeared uniformly susceptible to lasalocid, maduramicin, <b>narasin,</b> salinomycin, amoxicillin and tylosin whereas an extended frequency distribution range of MICs of lincomycin was seen, indicating acquired resistance in thirty-six isolates in the higher range of MICs. Nicarbazin did not inhibit the in vitro growth of the C. perfringens strains even at a concentration of 128 µg/ml. Supplementation of the diet from day 1 onwards with lasalocid, salinomycin, <b>narasin</b> or maduramicin lead {{to a reduction in}} birds with necrotic enteritis lesions as compared to the non-medicated infected control group.

40|$|In broiler chickens, an {{extensive}} spread of ESBL-forming E. coli {{was observed in}} the first week on fattening farms. This rapid spread was not observed in grandparent animals. A difference between broilers and grandparent animals is that the broilers are given coccidiostatics as feed additives, while the grandparents are vaccinated against coccidiosis. This study was performed to investigate if coccidiostatics can influence the growth of ESBL-forming E. coli, isolated from Dutch broilers. The effects of three ionophore coccidiostatics (used as feed additives in broiler feed) on the growth of ESBL-forming E. coli were studied in vitro. Furthermore a growth experiment with whole broiler feed was performed to detect other substances in the feed that might affect the growth of ESBL-forming E. coli. Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were determined for salinomycin (concentration range 0, 125 - 256 µg/ml), <b>narasin</b> (0, 3125 - 64 µg/ml) and monensin (0, 25 - 512 µg/ml). Six ESBL-positive strains and six ESBL-negative strains were tested. A growth experiment with a Bioscreen apparatus was performed with <b>narasin</b> and salinomycin for the same strains. Growth curves were made for each strain with concentrations of 1. 25, 12. 5 and 125 µg/ml salinomycin and 0. 5, 5 and 50 µg/ml <b>narasin</b> (concentrations were chosen considering the concentrations of the substances in broiler feed). A growth experiment with 3 ESBL-positive and 3 ESBL-negative strains was performed with whole sterilised broiler feed suspended in the test medium. The results of determining the MICs of the tested strains for the ionophores showed that the growth of the tested ESBL-positive strains as well as the growth of ESBL-negative strains was unaffected by the presence of the coccidiostatics. For salinomycin and monensin, the MICs of all tested strains were > 256 µg/ml and for <b>narasin</b> > 64 µg/ml. The growth curves of the tested strains made with the Bioscreen showed no indication that salinomycin or <b>narasin</b> had a consistent inhibitory or stimulatory effect on the growth of the tested E. coli-strains.

In Experiment 1, nicarbazin (NCZ) was fed at 20, 50, and 100 ppm. There was no depression in egg production, egg weight, or fertility from feeding these levels. As level of NCZ increased, there was a linear decrease in hatchability. The amount of 4, 4 '-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) in the egg yolks increased linearly as the levels of NCZ went up; the degree of egg-shell depigmentation was directly related to the level of NCZ fed starting at 50 ppm. Experiment 2 utilized a different strain of broiler breeders. Halofuginone (3 ppm), maduramicin (5 ppm), monensin (100 ppm), <b>narasin</b> (70 ppm), NCZ (125 ppm), robenidine (33 ppm), and salinomycin (60 ppm) were fed to broiler breeders at the levels listed.

40|$|Vancomycin {{resistance}} enterococci (VRE) are {{an important}} cause of nosocomial infections. Presence of VRE in farm animals constitute a reservoir of resistance that can spread to humans via the food-chain and is due to extensive use of the growth promoter avoparcin conferring cross-resistance to vancomycin. Since 2000, the occurrence of VRE among Swedish broilers has increased {{in the absence of}} any obvious selective pressure as avoparcin has not been used since 1984. Also, the increased occurrence seemed to be due to spread of one clone of VRE. The work of this thesis confirms that the increased occurrence of VRE is caused by the spread of one predominant clone. Both the predominant and the minority clones are E. faecium with plasmid mediated vanA gene. The vanA gene is transferrable from the predominant and several of the minority clones. Thus, the predominance of one clone is not due to that the resistance is untransferable from the clones. It also confirms that VRE among Swedish broilers have a potential for zoonotic spread of the vanA gene. Plasmid addiction systems are most likely not involved in the retention of the vanA gene as there is a near absence of such systems among VRE from Swedish broilers. Decreased susceptibility to the ionophore <b>narasin</b> can be co-transferred with the vanA gene from the predominant and some of the minority clones. Thereby the use of <b>narasin</b> for coccidial prophylaxis could contribute to retention of the vanA gene. The traits are probably located close to each other so when retaining the decreased susceptibility to <b>narasin,</b> the enterococci also retain the vanA gene. Broilers arriving to the farms are colonized with VRE persisting in the broiler houses. Differences in occurrence of VRE among farms indicate that the occurrence of VRE can be reduced. Furthermore, a reduction in the contamination of the broiler houses can be achieved by disinfection with a method combining steam and formaldehyde. Subsequently, this could reduce the occurrence of VRE in Swedish broiler production on the whole. Further research should focus on the role of <b>narasin</b> in the VRE epidemiology as well as exploring the possibility to eliminate VRE from Swedish broiler production...|$|E

There was a significant interaction of roxarsone and zinc bacitracin for feed utilization; addition of zinc bacitracin significantly improved feed utilization both in the presence and absence of roxarsone, but the improvement was greater in the absence of roxarsone. {Key words: zinc bacitracin, roxarsone, feed additives, body weight, <b>narasin)</b> 1990 Poultry Science 69 : 898 - 901 INTRODUCTION and roxarsone significantly increased BW _,,., gains and improved feed utilization (Waldroup Roxarsone and other organic arsenical com-et fl / 1 9 8 6 a) Z i n c b a c i t r a c i n significantly pounds have long been reported to enhance improve...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or {{substances}} used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the compatibility of microbial feed additive Bacillus subtilis PB 6 with the coccidiostats maduramycin ammonium, monensin sodium, <b>narasin</b> and robenidine hydrochloride. The in vivo compatibility of the coccidiostats with Bacillus subtilis PB 6 was assessed {{as part of a}} larger trial in which performance characteristics were measured. A negative control group was included, while the other groups received the recommended dose of Bacillus subtilis PB 6 in the presence or absence of the tested coccidiostats at their maximum authorised levels. Intestinal samples from six birds per treatment group were analysed for aerobic spore formers. Heat treatment of the samples was included to distinguish spores from vegetative cells. No significant differences in numbers of bacilli were observed between the coccidiostat-treated groups and the group treated with Bacillus subtilis PB 6 alone. Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that Bacillus subtilis PB 6 is compatible with maduramycin ammonium, monensin sodium, <b>narasin</b> and robenidine hydrochloride when added to diets for chickens for fattening...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotics in the {{environment}} are a potential threat to environmental ecosystems as well as human health and safety. Antibiotics are designed to have a biological effect at low doses, and the low levels detected in {{the environment}} have turned focus {{on the need for}} more research on environmental occurrence and fate, to assess the risk and requirement for future regulation. This article describes the first occurrence study of the antibiotic polyether ionophores (lasalocid, monensin, <b>narasin,</b> and salinomycin) in the Danish environment. Various environmental matrices (river water, sediment, and soil) have been evaluated during two different sampling campaigns carried out in July 2011 and October 2012 in an agricultural area of Zealand, Denmark. Lasalocid was not detected in any of the samples. Monensin was measured at a concentration up to 20 ng·L− 1 in river water and 13 µg·kg− 1 dry weight in the sediment as well as being the most frequently detected ionophore in the soil samples with concentrations up to 8 µg·kg− 1 dry weight. <b>Narasin</b> was measured in sediment samples at 2 µg·kg− 1 dry weight and in soil between 1 and 18 µg·kg− 1 dry weight. Salinomycin was detected in a single soil sample at a concentration of 30 µg·kg− 1 dry weight...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the addition of sheep blood to Mueller-Hinton II agar {{and the effects of}} aerobic incubation with or without CO 2 and of anaerobic incubation were tested with bacitracin, tylosin, avoparcin, virginiamycin, avilamycin, <b>narasin,</b> and flavomycin on enterococci. The antibacterial activity of bambermycin (Flavomycin) was strongly inhibited by the addition of blood, except with the species Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus casseliflavus, and Enterococcus gallinarum, which were not susceptible to this antibiotic on blood-free medium. With all other antimicrobials except avoparcin and tylosin, the presence of blood resulted in MIC increases of 1 to 3 log 2 differences. Incubation in aerobic or anaerobic atmospheres enriched with CO 2 lowered the susceptibility of enterococci to tylosin and increased their susceptibility to avilamycin, <b>narasin,</b> and avoparcin. This effect was most pronounced in tests on blood-free media. Results of susceptibility tests incubated under anaerobiosis and in a CO 2 -enriched atmosphere did not differ. For all enterococcal species, the preferred conditions for testing the susceptibility are Mueller-Hinton II medium supplemented with blood and incubation in a CO 2 -enriched atmosphere. However, when only E. faecium and Enterococcus faecalis are being tested, Mueller-Hinton II medium without blood incubated aerobically gives satisfactory results...|$|E
40|$|A new and fit {{to purpose}} multi-analyte method for the {{determination}} of six coccidiostats (monensin A, salinomycin, <b>narasin,</b> composed of its principle components <b>narasin</b> A and its minor component <b>narasin</b> I, lasalocid, semduramicin and maduramicin) in poultry and cattle compound feed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been developed and in-house validated. The concentration level of the target analytes at which the validation experiments {{have been carried out}} varied between 1 and 9 mg kg. The method developed involved a simple extraction of the coccidiostats from the feed samples followed by a clean-up by solid-phase extraction prior to chromatographic analysis. The analytes were quantified either by matrix matched standards or by the standard addition technique, obtaining the following performance profile of the method for the various analyte/matrix combinations. When quantifying against matrix matched standards, the concentration independent intermediate precision expressed in terms of relative percentage standard deviation varied between 4 and 10 % and the relative percentage recovery rates ranged from 87 to 120 % depending on the target analyte and matrix. When using the standard addition technique, the corresponding values for the intermediate precision varied between 2 and 8 % and the relative percentage recovery rate ranged from 73 to 115 %. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were different for the various analyte/matrix combinations but were in all cases below 0. 014 mg kg and 0. 046 mg kg respectively. Based on the obtained method performance characteristics, the method is considered suitable for {{the determination of}} ionophore coccidiostats in target feed. The main field of application of the validated method is to enforce European legislation regarding the authorisation of coccidiostats, focusing on the measurement at the authorised levels and at low level in feed during the withdrawal period at which the coccidiostats must not be added to the feed. Overall, the method proposed appears to be appropriate as a confirmatory method for the monitoring of these six ionophore coccidiostats and can therefore be considered as complimentary to the official PHLC-UV methods.

40|$|A pen trial using 1, 080 male Ross 308 broiler chicks (6 {{treatments}} with 6 replicates each) {{was conducted}} {{to examine the effects}} of 3 dietary phytogenic products on avian coccidiosis. The dietary treatments included (1) a negative control (NC), (2) a positive control (PC) without feed additive, (3) <b>Narasin</b> at 0. 7 kg/t (COCC), (4) PHYT 1 (oregano) at 2. 0 kg/t, (5) PHYT 2 (combination of Curcuma, saponins, and inulin) at 1. 0 kg/t, and (6) PHYT 3 (Quillaja) at 1. 0 kg/t. Treatments 2 through 6 were challenged with a mixture of Eimeria acervulina, Eimeria maxima, and Eimeria tenella at d 15 via feed. Standard performance parameters and coccidial lesion scoring (d 22) were conducted. One week after coccidial challenge, chicks BW of the COCC treatment and the NC were higher than all other treatments. Body weights on d 39 were 2. 47 (NC), 2. 34 (PC), 2. 51 (COCC), 2. 35 (PHYT 1), 2. 39 (PHYT 2), and 2. 41 kg (PHYT 3) with an SEM of 0. 033. For the entire trial period, <b>Narasin</b> yielded a significantly better FCR in comparison with the PC and PHYT 3. Overall mean lesion score was 0. 54 (NC), 0. 91 (PC), 0. 50 (COCC), 0. 81 (PHYT 1), 1. 02 (PHYT 2), and 1. 13 (PHYT 3) with an SEM of 0. 122.

40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} in animal isolates of enterococci is {{of public health}} concern {{because of the risk}} of transfer of antibiotic resistance isolates or resistance determinants to consumers via the food chain. In this study, phenotypic and genotypic {{resistance in}} 192 pig isolates of enterococci to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavophospholipol, gentamicin, <b>narasin,</b> tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin, vancomycin, virginiamycin, copper and zinc were investigated by susceptibility test and molecular methods. Resistance rates varied between the species but all isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, gentamicin and <b>narasin</b> but resistant to tetracycline and tylosin and intermediately resistant to copper. Only Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus were resistant to vancomycin and virginiamycin resistance was present in less than half the Enterococcus faecium isolates. Zinc resistance was largely confined to Enterococcus faecalis but bacitracin resistance was uncommon in E. faecalis in comparison with the other species. Tiamulin resistance was common in all species except E. casseliflavus. Resistance to flavophospholipol was detected in most E. faecium isolates and in a high proportion of E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus and E. hirae/durans but was only found in one isolate of E. faecalis. No tetO, rplC, rplD, vanA, vanB, vatA and vatD genes were found. The presence of ermB, tetL, tetM, tcrB, aac 6 -aph 2, tetK, tetS, vanC 1, vanC 2, lsaA, lsaB and vatE varied between the species and largely corresponded to the susceptibility phenotype. The findings show that resistance to antibiotics of high clinical significance for nosocomial Enterococcus infections is absent, whereas antimicrobial resistance was detected for some other antibiotics including bacitracin, flavophospholipol, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin and virginiamycin. ...|$|E
