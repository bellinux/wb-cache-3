5|$|In women, acne can be {{improved}} {{with the use of}} any combined birth control pill. These decrease the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries, resulting in lower skin production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins such as desogestrel, drospirenone, or <b>norgestimate</b> are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E

40|$|Progesterone is {{a potent}} hormone acting on the female {{reproductive}} tract and influencing a series of other functions. Recent studies revealed a correlation between progesterone and brain neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Our study evaluated the possible effect of <b>norgestimate,</b> a new progestin, on hypothalamic and pituitary beta-endorphin (B-EP) concentration in castrated female rats. Ovariectomy was performed under ethyl ether anesthesia. Treatment was started 3 weeks after surgery. <b>Norgestimate,</b> estradiol benzoate or <b>norgestimate</b> plus estradiol benzoate were administered. The two steroids were dissolved in sesame oil and injected (s. c.) every day for 2 weeks. Pituitary and hypothalamus B-EP concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Our studies showed that <b>norgestimate</b> increases the pituitary and hypothalamic B-EP concentration in female rats, reaching values higher than controls and estrogen-treated rats. Because B-EP has {{an important role in}} reproductive function, both modulating gonadotropin secretion and sexual behavior, the present results lead to the hypothesis that <b>norgestimate</b> affecting B-EP concentrations may influence central functions...|$|E
40|$|TRPC {{channels}} are {{a family of}} nonselective cation channels that regulate ion homeostasis and intracellular Ca 2 + signaling in numerous cell types. Important physiological functions such as vasoregulation, neuronal growth, and pheromone recognition have been assigned to this class of ion channels. Despite their physiological relevance, few selective pharmacological tools are available to study TRPC channel function. We, therefore, screened a selection of pharmacologically active compounds for TRPC modulating activity. We found that the synthetic gestagen <b>norgestimate</b> inhibited diacylglycerol-sensitive TRPC 3 and TRPC 6 with IC 50 s of 3 – 5 µM, while half-maximal inhibition of TRPC 5 required significantly higher compound concentrations (> 10 µM). <b>Norgestimate</b> blocked TRPC-mediated vasopressin-induced cation currents in A 7 r 5 smooth muscle cells and caused vasorelaxation of isolated rat aorta, indicating that <b>norgestimate</b> could be an interesting tool for the investigation of TRP channel function in native cells and tissues. The steroid hormone progesterone, which is structurally related to <b>norgestimate,</b> also inhibited TRPC channel activity with IC 50 s ranging from 6 to 18 µM but showed little subtype selectivity. Thus, TRPC channel inhibition by high gestational levels of progesterone {{may contribute to the}} physiological decrease of uterine contractility and immunosuppression during pregnancy...|$|E

New studies {{about the influence of}} hormonal contraception on the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been published. To evaluate new epidemiological data and to propose clinical consequences. A literature survey. Studies assessing the risk of specific types of hormonal contraception were evaluated, compared and set into a clinical perspective. The majority of newer studies have demonstrated a threefold increased risk of VTE in current users of medium- and low-dose combined oral contraceptives (COCs) with norethisterone, levonorgestrel (LNG) or <b>norgestimate</b> compared with non-users. The same studies have demonstrated a sixfold increased risk of VTE in users of combined pills with desogestrel, gestodene, drospirenone or cyproteroneacetate, and in users of the contraceptive vaginal ring, compared with non-users. The rate ratio of VTE between users of COCs with newer progestogens compared with users of COCs with LNG was 1. 5 - 2. 8 in seven studies and 1. 0 in two studies. Progestogen-only contraception did not confer an increased risk of VTE in any study. The incidence rate of VTE in non-pregnant women aged 15 - 49 years using non-hormonal contraception is three per 10 000 years. For women starting on hormonal contraception, we recommend medium- or low-dose combined pills with norethisterone, LNG or <b>norgestimate</b> as first-choice preparations. For the many women who are users of COCs with newer progestogens, although the absolute risk of VTE is low, a change to combined pills with norethisterone, LNG or <b>norgestimate</b> may halve their risk of VTE. Finally, we recommend COCs with 20 μg estrogen combined with the older progestogens to be launched in the Scandinavian countries. Women at an increased risk of VTE should consider progestogen-only contraception or non-hormonal contraception...|$|E
