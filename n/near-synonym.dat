40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{computational}} model for representing the fine-grained meanings of nearsynonyms and the differences between them. We also develop a lexical-choice process that can decide which of several <b>near-synonyms</b> is most appropriate in a particular situation. This research has direct applications in machine translation and text generation. We first identify the problems of representing <b>near-synonyms</b> in a computational lexicon and show that no previous model adequately accounts for near-synonymy. We then propose a preliminary theory to account for near-synonymy, relying crucially {{on the notion of}} granularity of representation, in which the meaning of a word arises out of a context-dependent combination of a context-independent core meaning and a set of explicit differences to its <b>near-synonyms.</b> That is, <b>near-synonyms</b> cluster together. We then develop a clustered model of lexical knowledge, derived from the conventional ontological model. The model cuts off the ontology at a coarse grain, thus avoiding an awkward proliferation of language-dependent concepts in the ontology, yet maintaining the advantages of efficient compututation and reasoning. The model groups <b>near-synonyms</b> into subconceptual clusters that are linked to the ontology. A cluster differentiates <b>near-synonyms</b> in terms of finegrained aspects of denotation, implication, expressed attitude, and style. The model is general enough to account for other types of variation, for instance, in collocational behaviour. An efficient, robust, and flexible fine-grained lexical-choice process is a consequence of a clustered model of lexical knowledge. To make it work, we formalize criteria for lexical choice as preferences to express certain concepts with varying indirectness, to express attitudes, and to establish certain styles. The lexical-choice process itself works on two tiers: between clusters and between near-synonyns of clusters. We describe our prototype implementation of the system, called I-Saurus. ...|$|R

40|$|There are arguably {{infinitely}} many dimensions {{along which}} members of a cluster of near-synonyms can differ (Cruse, 1986), and the nuances that differentiate near-synonyms along a dimension are often subtle and difficult even for native speakers. The diversity of <b>near-synonym</b> variation types has motivated the categorization of these dimensions of these variations. DiMarco, Hirst, & Stede (1993) proposed 38 dimensions for differentiating near-synonyms, which were further categorized into semantic and stylistic variations. Stede (1993) focused on the latter and further decomposed them into seven scalable sub-categories. Inkpen & Hirst (2006) organized <b>near-synonym</b> variations into a hierarchical structure, combining stylistic and attitudinal variation into one class in parallel to denotational differences. Despite the variety of categorization methods, stylistic variation among near-synonyms is an important dimension that has been frequently addressed. In this study, we hypothesize that the stylistic nature of nuances correlates {{to the degree of}} difficulty in choosing between near-synonyms. Contrasting some recent studies that focus on contextual preferences of synonyms (e. g., Arppe & Järvikivi 2007), we elect to investigate the internal features of <b>near-synonym</b> nuances.

40|$|Abstract. In machine {{translation}} and natural language generation, making {{the wrong word}} choice from a set of near-synonyms can be imprecise or awkward, or convey unwanted implications. Using Edmonds’s model of lexical knowledge to represent clusters of near-synonyms, {{our goal is to}} automatically derive a lexical knowledge-base from the Choose the Right Word dictionary of <b>near-synonym</b> discrimination. We do this by automatically classifying sentences in this dictionary according to the classes of distinctions they express. We use a decision-list learning algorithm to learn words and expressions that characterize the classes DENOTATIONAL DISTINCTIONS and ATTITUDE-STYLE DISTINCTIONS. These results are then used by an extraction module to actually extract knowledge from each sentence. We also integrate a module to resolve anaphors and word-to-word comparisons. We evaluate the results of our algorithm for several randomly selected clusters against a manually built standard solution, and compare them with the results of a baseline algorithm. 1 <b>Near-Synonym...</b>|$|E

It examines concordances of the <b>near-synonym</b> pairs from the Bank of English to identify the phraseological patterns these terms are associated with. The data collected indicate that each term {{is characterized by a}} distinct prototypical usage, but can also occur in the context of use of its <b>near-synonym</b> (although not to the same extent). The findings suggest that foreign language students should be sensitized to the prototypical context specificity of each near synonym, as this may prevent an incorrect use of terms. At the same time, the findings also reveal that, in the case of near-synonyms, a term and its immediate co-text are not always reliable predictors of each other...|$|E
