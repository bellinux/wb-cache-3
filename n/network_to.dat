In this paper we introduce temporal dependence <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> model the evolution of dependence networks and conviviality over time, we introduce epistemic dependence <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> combine the viewpoints of stakeholders, and we introduce normative dependence <b>networks</b> <b>to</b> model the transformation of social dependencies by hiding power relations and social structures to facilitate social interactions. We show {{how to use these}} visual languages in design, and we illustrate the design method using an example on virtual children adoptions. ...|$|R
