5|$|Hitler {{exploited}} documentary {{films and}} <b>newsreels</b> to inspire a cult of personality. He was involved and {{appeared in a}} series of propaganda films throughout his political career—such as Der Sieg des Glaubens and Triumph des Willens—made by Leni Riefenstahl, regarded as a pioneer of modern filmmaking.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the public}} uproar over the U-2 Incident, which sparked a major Soviet-American {{diplomatic}} crisis {{that led to the}} collapse of the 1960 Paris Summit, most of the official celebrations for Tritons submerged circumnavigation were canceled. The voyage did receive extensive contemporary coverage by the news media, including feature magazine articles by Argosy, Life, Look, National Geographic, and the Saturday Evening Post as well as television and <b>newsreels.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 1970 and 1982, over 30 short feature films, documentaries and <b>newsreels</b> were made. Produced on {{a weekly}} and monthly basis, they were {{processed}} mostly in Egypt and were referred to as Somaaliya oo Sawir'ah ("Somalia in the picture"). These short film productions were exhibited in 120 cinema halls throughout the country before the main attraction was projected.|$|E

40|$|News {{recommender}} systems provide {{users with}} access to news stories that they find interesting and relevant. As other online, stream-based recommender systems, they face particular challenges, including limited information on users’ preferences and also rapidly fluctuating item collections. In addition, technical aspects, such as response time and scalability, must be considered. Both algorithmic and technical considerations shape working requirements for real-world recommender systems in businesses. <b>NewsREEL</b> represents {{a unique opportunity to}} evaluate recommendation algorithms and for students to experience realistic conditions and to enlarge their skill sets. The <b>NewsREEL</b> Challenge requires participants to conduct data-driven experiments in <b>NewsREEL</b> Replay as well as deploy their best models into <b>NewsREEL</b> Live’s ‘living lab’. This paper presents <b>NewsREEL</b> 2017 and also provides insights into the effectiveness of <b>NewsREEL</b> to support the goals of instructors teaching recommender systems to students. We discuss the experiences of <b>NewsREEL</b> participants {{as well as those of}} instructors teaching recommender systems to students, and in this way, we showcase <b>NewsREEL’s</b> ability to support the education of future data scientists...|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{forms of}} public film display in Somalia were Italian <b>newsreels</b> of key events {{during the colonial}} period in Italian Somaliland. Examples of such works include Somalia: Gheledi (1913), Somalia italiana (1913), Somalia: Le bellezze del fiume Nebi (1913), Sotto la Croce del Sud - Somalia Italiana (1926), Visioni della Somalia italiana (1929) and Viaggio di S.M. il Re in Somalia (novembre-dicembre 1934) (1934).|$|E
5|$|McQuarrie and Alexander {{researched}} first-hand accounts, photos, <b>newsreels</b> and texts. They {{also examined}} Gestapo and SS records, as the organizations had been meticulous in reconstructing {{the events of}} the conspiracy in its aftermath. A timeline of events was created, from which McQuarrie and Alexander shaped the script. After production began in Berlin, the writers were able to visit locations and meet with relatives of the conspirators; these meetings informed changes made to the script during filming.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} {{of the existence of}} 30 years of <b>newsreels</b> archives were filmmakers who made early sound era documentaries. World War I was a popular topic of these pictures and spawned the following documentaries; The Big Drive (1933), World in Revolt (1933), This is America (1933), and Hell's Holiday (1933). The most prescient pre-Code World War I documentary was aptly called The First World War (1934) and was the most critically and commercially successful documentary of the era.|$|E
5000|$|The Hearst News of the Day <b>Newsreel</b> is much rarer {{than the}} Universal reel. A high quality {{government}} archive {{copy of the}} Universal version also appeared online (which also includes the Universal <b>Newsreel</b> the wreckage a few days after, and the Pathe <b>newsreel).</b> Compared to the Universal edit, the Hearst <b>newsreel</b> has some different shots of the airship over New York and also shows footage of passengers inside the ship from 1936. The same narration {{is used in the}} Gaumont British News report which uses footage from both Universal/Hearst and Movietone. Another redub of the <b>newsreel</b> is the [...] "Victoria Record".|$|R

5|$|The NFR {{includes}} films {{ranging from}} Hollywood classics to orphan films. A film {{is not required}} to be feature-length, nor is it required to have been theatrically released in the traditional sense. The Registry contains <b>newsreels,</b> silent films, student films, experimental films, short films, music videos, films out of copyright protection or in the public domain, film serials, home movies, documentaries, animation and independent films. As of the 2016 listing, there are 700films preserved in the Registry.|$|E
5|$|The RNC hired Albert Lasker, an {{advertising}} executive from Chicago, to publicize Harding, and Lasker unleashed a broad-based advertising campaign that used many now-standard advertising techniques {{for the first}} time in a presidential campaign. Lasker's approach included <b>newsreels</b> and sound recordings. Visitors to Marion had their photographs taken with Senator and Mrs. Harding, and copies were sent to their hometown newspapers. Billboard posters, newspapers and magazines were employed in addition to motion pictures. Telemarketers were used to make phone calls with scripted dialogues to promote Harding.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the Dutch East Indies, with over forty {{domestic}} productions released. Following the Japanese occupation in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the ethnic Chinese-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film– Rd Ariffien's Berdjoang (Struggle; 1943)– six short films, and several <b>newsreels.</b> All were pro-Japanese propaganda.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} a <b>newsreel</b> story is in the film Citizen Kane (1941), which was {{prepared}} by RKO's actual <b>newsreel</b> staff.

5|$|The legend {{describes}} the killings and disappearances {{of some of}} the residents of Blair, Maryland (a fictitious town on the site of Burkittsville, Maryland) from the 18th to 20th centuries. Residents blamed these occurrences on the ghost of Elly Kedward, a Blair resident accused of practicing witchcraft in 1785 and sentenced to death by exposure. The Curse of the Blair Witch presents the legend as real, complete with manufactured newspaper articles, <b>newsreels,</b> television news reports, and staged interviews.|$|E
5|$|The wartime {{authorities}} in both Britain and America produced {{a wide variety}} of documentary films. Their purposes included military training, advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security. Since these films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly, commercially produced films often combined information, support for the war effort, and a degree of propaganda. <b>Newsreels,</b> ostensibly simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and were often dramatised. More recently, in the Iran-Iraq War, Morteza Avini's Ravayat-e Fath (Chronicles of Victory) television series combined front-line footage with commentary.|$|E
5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in <b>newsreels</b> around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E
40|$|In the CLEF <b>NewsREEL</b> 2017 challenge, {{we build}} a {{delegation}} model {{based on the}} contextual bandit algorithm. Our goal is to investigate whether a bandit approach combined with context extracted from the user side, from the item side and from user-item interaction can help choose the appropriate recommender from a recommender algorithm pool for the incoming recommendation requests. We took part in both tasks: <b>NewsREEL</b> Live and <b>NewsREEL</b> Replay. In the experiment, we test several bandit approaches with two types of context features. The result from <b>NewsREEL</b> Replay suggests that delegation model based on the contextual bandit algorithm can improve the click through rate (CTR). In <b>NewsREEL</b> Live, a similar delegation model is implemented. However, the delegation model from <b>NewsREEL</b> Live is trained by the data stream from <b>NewsREEL</b> Replay. This {{is due to the}} fact that the low volume of data received from the online scenario is not enough to support the training of the delegation model. For our future work, we will add more recommender algorithms to the recommender algorithm pool and explores other context features. Multimedia Computin...|$|R
50|$|The March of Time film series {{ended in}} 1951, when the {{widespread}} adoption {{of television and}} daily TV news shows made the <b>newsreel</b> format obsolete. <b>Newsreel</b> series such as Pathé News (1910-56), Paramount News (1927-57), Fox Movietone News (1928-63), Hearst Metrotone News/News of the Day (1914-67), and Universal <b>Newsreel</b> (1929-67) continued for a while longer.|$|R
50|$|Regularly {{scheduled}} {{network television}} newscasts began entering American {{homes in the}} late 1940s with NBC's NBC Television <b>Newsreel,</b> launched in February 1948 as simply film with narration—although The Esso <b>Newsreel</b> (an irregularly scheduled news film presentation) was seen on NBC's New York station WNBT—now WNBC—and eventually fed {{to a handful of}} cities prior to this program, as was The War As It Happens {{in the final days of}} World War II, another irregularly scheduled NBC television <b>newsreel</b> program. Later in 1948, when sponsored by Camel Cigarettes, NBC Television <b>Newsreel</b> was renamed Camel <b>Newsreel</b> Theatre and then, when John Cameron Swayze was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949, the program was renamed Camel News Caravan.|$|R
5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in August 1945, {{a number}} of native Indonesian employees of Nippon Eigasha formed Berita Film Indonesia, which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly proclaimed Indonesian government. During the ensuing revolution, allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of <b>newsreels</b> at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce fictional films. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised {{in part by the}} Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after his arrival, Hess began exhibiting amnesia, {{which may have}} been feigned in the hope of avoiding the death sentence. Medical personnel who examined Hess reported he was not insane and was fit to stand trial. At least two examiners, the British doctor and the Soviet one, noted their belief that Hess's amnesia might be fake. Efforts were made to trigger his memory, including bringing in his former secretaries and showing old <b>newsreels,</b> but he persisted in showing no response to these stimuli. When Hess was allowed to make a statement to the tribunal on 30 November, he admitted that he had faked memory loss as a tactic. He spoke to the tribunal again on 31 August 1946, the last day of closing statements.|$|E
5|$|The Princess Theatre opened as a single-screen cinema on March 8, 1915 to rave reviews. It {{had cost}} McKernan CDN$75,000 {{and had taken}} 10 months to build, longer than expected. The theatre opened with 660 seats and the largest live {{performance}} stage in a cinema west of Winnipeg. It {{was at the time}} the only cinema on Edmonton’s south side, and would keep that title until the opening of the Garneau Theatre in 1940. Opening night was a benefit concert for The Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, associated with the 19th Alberta Dragoons, B Squad. The program proudly included <b>newsreels</b> “featuring actual war scenes”. In audience were the Lt. Governor and Mayor W.T. Henry. The house’s first feature film, The Eagle’s Mate starring Mary Pickford, was screened the following night.|$|E

5|$|Against his wishes, Jabara {{received}} a stateside leave for a publicity tour. The Jabara family {{grocery store in}} Wichita was thronged with people for days, and both {{he and his father}} John appeared on local and national radio and television. Wichita mounted one of its most-attended parades in the city's history. Jabara was even sent on a goodwill tour with his father through the Middle East, and gave a speech in his father's hometown of Marjayoun, Lebanon. Film <b>newsreels</b> included footage of his aircraft and other accolades included his own song ("That Jabara Bird") and a ritual rewarding of his Distinguished Service Cross at a Boston baseball game. Jabara returned to the United States in May 1951 for temporary assignment to Air Force Headquarters, Washington, D.C. Two months later he was transferred to the Air Training Command at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. Upon his request, he returned for another tour of duty overseas, arriving in Korea in January 1953.|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{attendees}} at the festival, {{there were}} relatively few witnesses, and the incident {{did not cause}} any delay in the main proceedings.

Most of the few photographs of the incidents have been destroyed or forgotten and lost. Siwiec was censored out of official photographs of the Central Photographic Agency (Centralna Agencja Fotograficzna), which had a monopoly on issuing photos for the press in the era of communist Poland. His act was captured in a 7-second film by a motion picture camera of the Polish Film Chronicle, but the official <b>newsreels</b> of the festival omitted any mention of the incident.
