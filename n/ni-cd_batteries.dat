5000|$|<b>Ni-Cd</b> <b>batteries</b> contain between 6% (for {{industrial}} batteries) and 18% (for commercial batteries) cadmium, {{which is}} a toxic heavy metal and therefore requires special care during battery disposal. In the United States, part of the battery price is a fee for its proper disposal {{at the end of}} its service lifetime. Under the so-called [...] "batteries directive" [...] (2006/66/EC), the sale of consumer <b>Ni-Cd</b> <b>batteries</b> has now been banned within the European Union except for medical use; alarm systems; emergency lighting; and portable power tools. This last category has been banned effective 2016. Under the same EU directive, used industrial <b>Ni-Cd</b> <b>batteries</b> must be collected by their producers in order to be recycled in dedicated facilities.|$|E

50|$|Recently, {{nickel-metal hydride}} and {{lithium-ion}} batteries have become commercially available and cheaper, the former type now rivaling <b>Ni-Cd</b> <b>batteries</b> in cost. Where energy density is important, <b>Ni-Cd</b> <b>batteries</b> {{are now at}} a disadvantage compared with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. However, the Ni-Cd battery is still very useful in applications requiring very high discharge rates because it can endure such discharge with no damage or loss of capacity.|$|E

5000|$|The {{terminal}} voltage of a <b>Ni-Cd</b> <b>battery</b> declines more slowly {{as it is}} discharged, compared with carbon-zinc batteries.

40|$|In {{order to}} develope moving as a {{teaching}} material used solar cells for the machine mechanics study in the junior high school, we researched some soler cells as (A) compound semiconductor solar cell, (B) polycrystal silicon cell and (C) single crystal silicon solar cell.

The compound semicondutor (CdS-CdTe thin film) solar cell connected with a <b>Ni-Cd</b> <b>battery</b> showed the smallest counter-current value. So, we determined to deveope some moving models connected with a parallel circuit of a <b>Ni-Cd</b> <b>battery</b> and CdS-CdTe thin film solar cells.

50|$|Another {{historically}} important {{variation on}} the basic NiCd cell is the addition of lithium hydroxide to the potassium hydroxide electrolyte.

50|$|<b>Ni-Cd</b> <b>{{batteries}}</b> used {{to replace}} 9 V batteries usually only have six cells, for a terminal voltage of 7.2 volts.

50|$|Specialty <b>Ni-Cd</b> <b>batteries</b> {{are used}} in {{cordless}} and wireless telephones, emergency lighting, and other applications.

5000|$|The {{batteries}} {{are more difficult}} to damage than other batteries, tolerating deep discharge for long periods.

After digestion, treatment, and liquefaction, the pH values of the sample solutions were adjusted to the required value as reported in literature (Reddy and Priya 2006). Then, the cadmium concentration was evaluated using the developed CPE sensor.|$|R
5000|$|Today, all {{consumer}} <b>Ni-Cd</b> <b>batteries</b> use the [...] "Swiss roll" [...] or [...] "jelly-roll" [...] configuration.

The capacity of the battery is not actually reduced substantially. Some electronics designed to be powered by <b>Ni-Cd</b> <b>batteries</b> are able to withstand this reduced voltage {{long enough for the}} voltage to return to normal.
