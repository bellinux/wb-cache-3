5|$|The illness {{emphasised}} certain {{traits in}} his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had a blind {{faith in his}} closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Tenar does not become a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary {{character}} of The Farthest Shore), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast to the male bildungsroman in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar's coming of age is a female bildungsroman, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value herself for herself and not simply {{for her role as}} a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that she did not see. Over the course of the story she realized that her true power is not her authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that true power is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Lasting {{impressions}} of the war experience are ever-prevalent on the island. In Canada, 1 July is celebrated as Canada Day, in recognition of Canadian confederation. In the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador the date is Memorial Day, in remembrance of the Newfoundland Regiment's losses at Beaumont-Hamel. Memorial University College, now Memorial University of Newfoundland, was originally established as a memorial to Newfoundlanders who {{had lost their lives}} in active service during the First World War. Lastly, the six caribou memorials and the National War Memorial erected following the First World War, and the establishment of the preserved battlefield park at Beaumont-Hamel which is visited by thousands of tourists a year. The Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site also serves an informal ambassadorial function, educating visitors <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> the experience of the Newfoundland Regiment but also regarding the history of the island.|$|E

25|$|Natural {{selection}} is commonly equated with {{survival of the}} fittest, but this expression originated in Herbert Spencer's Principles of Biology in 1864, five years after Charles Darwin published his original works. Survival of the fittest describes the process of natural selection incorrectly, because natural {{selection is}} <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> survival {{and it is not}} always the fittest that survives.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{observations}} and modeling are producing information <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> the present climate and atmospheric conditions on Mars {{but also about}} its past. The Noachian-era Martian atmosphere had long been theorized to be carbon dioxide–rich. Recent spectral observations of deposits of clay minerals on Mars and modeling of clay mineral formation conditions have found {{that there is little}} to no carbonate present in clay of that era. Clay formation in a carbon dioxide–rich environment is always accompanied by carbonate formation, although the carbonate may later be dissolved by volcanic acidity.|$|E
5000|$|While {{writers of}} color may {{sometimes}} focus on experiences unique to their cultural heritage, which have sometimes been considered [...] "subcategories" [...] of national heritage (e.g. {{the black experience}} within American culture), many do <b>not</b> <b>only</b> write <b>about</b> their particular culture or members within that culture, {{in the same way}} that many Americans of European descent (traditionally categorized as Caucasian or white) do <b>not</b> <b>only</b> write <b>about</b> Western culture or members of their cultural heritage. The works of many well-known writers of color tend to examine issues of identity politics, religion, feminism, race relations, economic disparity, and the often unacknowledged and rich histories of various cultural groups.|$|R

25|$|Employment {{opportunities}} are limited for women worldwide. The ability to materially control one's environment by gaining {{equal access to}} work that is humanizing and allows for meaningful relationships with other workers is an essential capability. Employment is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> financial independence, but about higher security through an established legal position, real world experience, deeply important for sheltered or shy women, and higher regard within the family, which gives women a better bargaining position. Though there has been major growth in women's employment, {{the quality of the}} jobs still remains deeply unequal.|$|E
25|$|The table below {{shows the}} various {{proposals}} for how the frieze may have been originally designed to be displayed.

The arrangement made by the British Museum follows that proposed by Peter Corbett, but others by the American scholar W.B.Dinsmoor and that proposed by Haller are amongst the conflicting theories shown below. In some cases the authors disagree <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> the order but also about which pictures were displayed on which wall.

The man's condition continues to deteriorate as Sarah's fetus develops. The baby is born prematurely and in poor health, and is in need of a blood transfusion. Johnny and Sarah are ultimately nervous <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> the baby's survival chances, but also of the skyrocketing hospital bills that will now need to be paid following the baby's delivery, causing Sarah to have a brief nervous breakdown and blame Johnny for Frankie's death, and tearfully berates him.|$|E

25|$|Richard Upjohn {{built the}} house in the Greek Revival {{architectural}} style for William Rotch Jr. in 1834, on a New Bedford plot Rotch had inherited from his father. It was Upjohn's first house, near the beginning of a long career. Rotch also commissioned a garden in the rear, which later owners would significantly expand. The property remained private until 1981, when it was bought by local preservationists and reopened as a historic house museum. It was declared a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Today the museum educates visitors <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> whaling but, through its gardens and associated programs for local schools, about the environment as well.|$|E
25|$|The Creole Case gained notoriety as it {{resulted}} from a November 1841 slave revolt on an American brig. After 19 slaves {{took control of the}} crew of the Creole, they ordered the ship sailed to Nassau, Bahamas; one of the leaders had heard of the Hermosa case the year before and knew the British had abolished slavery. Ultimately, 128 of 135 slaves from the Creole were freed by the British colonists. It was the most successful slave revolt in US history. The US was concerned <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> compensation for slaveholders' losses. It feared that the success of the Creole slaves would encourage others to attempt such ship revolts to reach freedom in the British West Indies, and threaten the coastwise slave trade and slavery in the South.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{assumptions}} underlie their game theoretic model, {{and allow for}} the authors' simplified model of society. First, Acemoglu and Robinson assume that society is simply divided between a small rich class and a large poor class. Second, they assume that regimes must be either democratic or nondemocratic; {{there is nothing in}} between. Third, people's preferences in society are defined only by monetary redistribution from the rich ruling class. The more monetary benefits they get, the more they prefer the ruling class. Fourth, people care <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> redistribution today but also redistribution in the future. Therefore, people would not only want more redistribution today but also they want to see a guarantee for more or stable redistribution in the future. Fifth, the economic output of a country fluctuates year by year, which means revolution is less costly for the ruling class during economic downturn. Finally and most importantly, each individual in the society tries to maximize their own utility.|$|E
