25|$|Tides are {{commonly}} semi-diurnal (two high <b>waters</b> and two <b>low</b> <b>waters</b> each day), or diurnal (one tidal cycle per day). The two high waters {{on a given}} day are typically not the same height (the daily inequality); these are the higher high water and the lower high water in tide tables. Similarly, the two <b>low</b> <b>waters</b> each day are the higher <b>low</b> <b>water</b> and the lower <b>low</b> <b>water.</b> The daily inequality is not consistent and is generally small when the Moon is over the equator.|$|R

40|$|In an {{experimental}} temperature-regulated mesocosm, the <b>low</b> <b>water</b> temperature tolerance of five dominant scleractinian coral species Pavona decussate, Acropora pulchra, Acropora florida, Acropora valida, and Pontes lutea in Sanya Bay was investigated, and their responding modes {{to the cold}} water stress were analyzed. The tolerance of test corals to <b>low</b> <b>water</b> temperature was closely related to their morphologies, with the branching corals being the most vulnerable to bleaching and death by separating the symbiotic polyps from their skeletons. The lethal <b>low</b> <b>water</b> temperature for branching Acropora corals was 14 °C lasting for 3 days, and that for foliose P. decussate was 12 °C lasting for 10 days. Massive P. lutea corals responded to <b>low</b> <b>water</b> temperature by forming mucus membrane, which helped to prevent the further losing of symbiotic algae. The corals showing strong tolerance to high water temperature also had strong tolerance to <b>low</b> <b>water</b> temperature, and had similar responding modes to both high and <b>low</b> <b>water</b> temperature, i. e., the corals didn 2 ̆ 7 t extend their tentacle first, followed by the continuous release of mucus and the discharge of symbiotic zooxanthellae, and finally, bleached and died...|$|R
40|$|Suceava river basin, suprapus {{over the}} eastern {{slopes of the}} Eastern Carpathian and over the Suceava Plateau, is {{strongly}} influenced by the climatic characteristics of tis area, such as very low temperatures during winter, creating a long period with freezing river water. This is why winter is the main season with <b>low</b> <b>waters,</b> when the river discharge drops below a certain values, threating the water supplying for the settlements in the basin, even the depletion of rivers. As follows, there will be presented these periods in which the river’s discharge value drops below a threshold value, specific for <b>low</b> <b>waters</b> using the program HydroOffice. Thiss program helped us better calculating the parameters of <b>low</b> <b>waters,</b> such as their duration, frequency, intensity (severity), minimum discharge, etc. All these will show that this river basin belongs to the Eastern Carpathian water flow regime, with the highest frequency of <b>low</b> <b>waters</b> during winter, followed by autumn <b>low</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} a plant depends in part {{on its ability to}} locate water while {{securely}} anchoring in the soil. Cellular growth in roots is driven by water uptake and resulting increases in turgor pressure. <b>Low</b> <b>water</b> potentials slow the rate of primary root growth and induce a suite of changes in the growth zone. To better understand the effects of <b>low</b> <b>water</b> potentials on the growth and structure of primary roots, Zea mays seedlings were grown in different concentrations of polyethylene glycol solution. The effects of <b>low</b> <b>water</b> potentials on the water content, the spatial distribution of growth, and the mechanical properties of the root throughout the growth zone were quantified. <b>Low</b> <b>water</b> potentials decreased the total amount of water in roots and the percent water composition of roots. <b>Low</b> <b>water</b> potentials also decreased relative elemental growth rate and shifted the region of maximal growth rate towards the root tip. Because of water stress induced root thinning and cell wall stress relaxation at the cellular level, <b>low</b> <b>water</b> potentials were expected to alter the mechanical properties of roots. Engineering beam theory was adapted to test for water stress induced changes in the spatial distributions of flexural stiffness (EI), the product of the material term E (Young's modulus of elasticity) and the geometrical term I (second moment of area). <b>Low</b> <b>water</b> potentials decreased EI of roots, due mostly to root thinning (and thus reductions of I). Increasing water stress had no consistent effects on E, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms to maintain root material properties despite cellular changes in wall properties due to water stress. Root thinning in <b>low</b> <b>water</b> potentials results from the promotion of longitudinal over lateral growth to facilitate finding deeper water sources. Though water stress weakens roots by reducing EI, soil impedance has been shown previously to cause root thickening. Soil impedance could thus offset root thinning by <b>low</b> <b>water</b> potentials and increase EI of roots by increasing I. Further studies should test the hypothesis that water stress and impedance have counterbalancing effects on root mechanical properties, thus promoting deep penetration of soils for water while maintaining the mechanical properties necessary for penetrating hard soils...|$|R
