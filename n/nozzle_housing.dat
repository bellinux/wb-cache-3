40|$|Ablative {{materials}} {{are commonly used}} to protect the <b>nozzle</b> <b>housing</b> and to provide the internal contour to expand the exhaust gases in solid rocket motors (SRM). Due to the extremely harsh environment in which these materials operate, they are chemically eroded during motor firing with a resulting performance reduction. The objective of the present work is to study the erosion rate of graphite SRM nozzles under {{a wide range of}} pressure conditions for both metallized and non-metallized propellants. Recently, Evans et al. have performed extensive nozzle erosion rate measurements for G- 90 graphite using an instrumented sub-scale solid rocket motor (ISPM) capable of performing tests at elevated pressure levels. Numerical simulations have been performed to reproduce some of the experimental tests for nominal chamber pressures up to 250 bar. The adopted approach relies on a validated full Navier-Stokes flow solver coupled with a thermochemical ablation model which takes into account finite-rate heterogeneous chemical reactions at the nozzle surface, rate of diffusion of the species through the boundary-layer, ablation species injection in the boundary layer, heat conduction inside the nozzle material, and variable multispecies thermophysical properties...|$|E

40|$|Ablative {{materials}} {{are commonly used}} to protect the <b>nozzle</b> metallic <b>housing</b> and to provide the internal contour to expand the exhaust gases in both solid and hybrid rockets. Because of interaction with hot gas, these {{materials are}} chemically eroded during rocket firing, with a resulting nominal performance reduction. The objective of the present work is to study the erosion behavior of graphite nozzles in hybrid engines at different operating conditions and compare results with those obtained for solid motors. A main distinctive feature of hybrid engine operating conditions is, in fact, a greater concentration of oxygen-containing combustion products than solid motors.

40|$|Summary. In an {{aerodynamic}} nozzle a convergent primary <b>nozzle</b> is <b>housed</b> {{within an}} afterbody which {{is surrounded by}} a shroud. Part of the external flow is captured thereby and compressed by the under-expanded primary jet. At the design point this system is not as efficient as a convergent-divergent nozzle but its off-design performance should be better. In the experiment axi-symmetric models were used. The shrouds were cylindrical externally and either cylindrical or convergent-divergent internally. With each model the thrust and afterbody pressure distributions were measured at jet pressure ratios up to 20 with a free-stream Mach number of 2. 0. Component drags were estimated indirectly from these measurements. For comparison, the thrust of unshrouded convergent and convergent-divergent nozzles was measured under the same conditions. With the cylindrical shrouds the effects of shroud length, shroud diameter and boundary-layer thickness were investigated. The greatest thrust developed by these models was about 5 % less than that of the equivalent convergent-divergent nozzle. With the convergent-divergent shrouds the main variable studied was the ratio shroud throat area/shroud exit area. The thrust of the best model was some 9 % less than that of the convergent-divergent reference nozzle...|$|R
40|$|Carbon Fiber Rope (CFR) {{thermal barrier}} systems are being {{considered}} for use in several RSRM (Reusable Solid Rocket Motor) nozzle joints {{as a replacement for}} the current assembly gap close-out process/design. This study provides for development and test verification of analysis methods used for flow-thermal modeling of a CFR thermal barrier subject to fault conditions such as rope combustion gas blow-by and CFR splice failure. Global model development is based on a 1 -D (one dimensional) transient volume filling approach where the flow conditions are calculated as a function of internal 'pipe' and porous media 'Darcy' flow correlations. Combustion gas flow rates are calculated for the CFR on a per-linear inch basis and solved simultaneously with a detailed thermal-gas dynamic model of a local region of gas blow by (or splice fault). Effects of gas compressibility, friction and heat transfer are accounted for the model. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) solutions of the fault regions are used to characterize the local flow field, quantify the amount of free jet spreading and assist in the determination of impingement film coefficients on the nozzle housings. Gas to wall heat transfer is simulated by a large thermal finite element grid of the local structure. The employed numerical technique loosely couples the FE (Finite Element) solution with the gas dynamics solution of the faulted region. All free constants that appear in the governing equations are calibrated by hot fire sub-scale test. The calibrated model is used to make flight predictions using motor aft end environments and timelines. Model results indicate that CFR barrier systems provide a near 'vented joint' style of pressurization. Hypothetical fault conditions considered in this study (blow by, splice defect) are relatively benign in terms of overall heating to <b>nozzle</b> metal <b>housing</b> structures...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) program, nozzle-to-case joint polysulfide adhesive gas paths have occurred on several flight motors. These gas paths have allowed hot motor gases to reach the wiper O-ring. Even though these motors continue to fly safely with this condition, a desire was to reduce such occurrences. The RSRM currently uses a J-leg joint configuration on case field joints and igniter inner and outer joints. The J-leg joint configuration has been successfully demonstrated on numerous RSRM flight and static test motors, eliminating hot gas intrusion to the critical O-ring seals on these joints. Using the proven technology demonstrated on the case field joints and igniter joints, a nozzle-to-case joint J-leg design was developed for implementation on RSRM flight motors. This configuration provides an interference fit with <b>nozzle</b> fixed <b>housing</b> phenolics at assembly, with a series of pressurization gaps incorporated outboard of the joint mating surface to aid in joint pressurization and to eliminate any circumferential flow in this region. The joint insulation is bonded to the nozzle phenolics using the same pressure sensitive adhesive used in the case field joints and igniter joints. An enhancement to the nozzle-to-case joint J-leg configuration is the implementation of a carbon rope thermal barrier. The thermal barrier is located downstream of the joint bondline and is positioned within the joint in a manner where any hot gas intrusion into the joint passes through the thermal barrier, reducing gas temperatures to a level that would not affect O-rings downstream of the thermal barrier. This paper discusses the processes used in reaching a final nozzle-to-case joint J-leg design, provides structural and thermal results in support of the design, and identifies fabrication techniques and demonstrations used in arriving at the final configuration...|$|R
5000|$|Burbank auto customizer George Barris {{was given}} four weeks to supply {{vehicles}} {{for the film}} that was made from a left over Munster Koach fiberglass body. The top was removed, the rear engine was moved back in the square tube frame, then the second engine was {{placed in front of}} the rear engine. The body after finished altering it, was channeled over frame. The body was cut after the first doors, then the rear section of the body was moved forward. They had to make both slender doors buy using the third rear doors and the front doors. After getting the right measurements they made the new doors. Then they put gold Naugahyde on the doors and spare tire carriers. The top in back is just side pieces, so a lid had to go over them to get the side pieces to fit. They put pompoms around this rectangular lid. The windshield frame was angled forward, with another frame to meet the top of windshield frame to make an open triangle. The car was called the ZZR that was equipped with a variety of weapons in the manner of James Bond's customized Aston Martin DB-5 in Goldfinger. The $22,000 ZZR featured two 425 CID Buick engines bored out to 440 CID, mounted in tandem with an Ansen Posi-shift Powerglide transmission with two carburetors per engine with a four holed Hilborn injector scoop. The rear scoop was higher because it had a Cadillac air cleaner underneath it. M/T tires mounted on 12" [...] Raders Star Mags front and One Ribbed in the rear. M/T Dirt Tires were used for traction on the beach sand, a Cal-Automotive kick channeled is mounted on rectangular tube frame with dual radiators. The brass custom grill cost $5,000 to make. The French Cibie headlights are mounted vertically between the fenders in specially designed nose with headlight shell, painted lilac to match the rear fenders. The rest of the body is in gold. A complete arsenal in the rear trunk area is stocked with handguns, tear gas, hand grenades, telescopic machine gun, tar squirter, feather blow gun, and “skid juice” spray <b>nozzle.</b> Rear fenders <b>house</b> flame throwers, while bullets are fired from the front fenders. A model kit of the ZZR was made by AMT.|$|R
