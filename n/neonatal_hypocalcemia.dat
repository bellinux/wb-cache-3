40|$|Purpose: <b>Neonatal</b> late-onset <b>hypocalcemia</b> {{is defined}} as hypocalcemia {{developed}} after postnatal 3 days and asso-ciated with hypoparathyroidism, high phosphate diets and vitamin D deficiency. We experienced the increment of <b>neonatal</b> late onset <b>hypocalcemia</b> over 1 year. We tried to evaluate the relationship between late onset hypocalcemia and maternal hypovitaminosis D. Methods: The medical records in the neonates with late-onset hypocalcemia during January 2007 to July 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Among those patients, 17 paired sera of mothers and neonates had collected. The levels of 25 -OH vitamin D (25 OHD) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were measured and were compared with neo-nate and the mother. Results: The mean gestational age was 38 + 1 weeks, and the mean body weight was 2, 980 g. The onset time of hypo-calcemia was 5. 9 days of age. Most of them (88. 2 %) were feeding with formula {{and no one was}} only breast milk feeding. Of the 17 patients, 13 were born in spring or in winter. The median levels of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, iPTH and 25 OHD were 7. 0 mg/dL, 8. 6 mg/dL, 191. 0 U/L, 57. 2 pg/mL and 24. 0 ng/mL in neonates. The levels of 25 OHD of 6 neonates were ＜ 20 ng/mL. A total of 16 mothers were considered vitamin D-deficient (＜ 20 ng/mL), and vitamin D insufficient (20 ＜ 25 OHD＜ 30 ng/mL).

40|$|Phototherapy is {{the most}} common, most effective, and least {{dangerous}} treatment method for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and is {{the treatment of the}} first choice for <b>neonatal</b> icterus. <b>Hypocalcemia</b> is one of the lesser-known complications of phototherapy. Some studies have shown a relationship between increased urinary calcium excretion and phototherapy-induced hypocalcemia. We aimed to assess the effect of phototherapy on urinary calcium excretion in term neonates. This before-after study was performed on 80 term neonates having hyper- bilirubinemia referred to the 17 thShahrivar Hospital, Rasht, Guilan Province, Northern Iran, over a one-year period from May 2013 to May 2014. Electrocardiography was performed to measure QTc in all neonates at admission and 48 h after phototherapy. Blood and urine samples were taken from all neonates before and 48 h after phototherapy. Phototherapy was performed using four lamps with similar wavelengths from a distance of 20 cm. The serum and urinary calcium and sodium levels and urinary creatinine level before and after phototherapy were measured and compared. Data were analyzed using SPSS software, version 16. The mean age of the study subjects was 7. 01 ± 4. 13 days. We did not find any significant difference between urinary calcium levels (P = 0. 0001), urinary creatinine levels (P = 0. 954), or the calcium/creatinine ratio (P = 0. 086) before and after phototherapy.

40|$|Background: <b>Neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcemia</b> is a {{metabolic}} abnormality commonly reported. Late onset hypocalcemia usually manifests after 7 days and requires a long-term therapy. <b>Neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcemia</b> due to hypoparathyroidism can manifest as life-threatening seizures or tetany. Initial management {{is important to}} prevent any complication due to this condition. However, the initial management to correct hypocalcemia with the administration of calcitriol, high dose intravenous and oral calcium may take longer to achieve because of hypoparathyroidism. Case summary: We report a case of late onset <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcemia</b> in a nine-days-old baby. He was born on the 35 - 36 week of gestational age by Caesarean section, without asphyxia nor neonatal infection. The baby had a refractory seizure with low serum calcium and magnesium, high phosphate, normal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and low calcium creatinine urine ratio. His 25 -hidroxy vitamin D (25 -OHD) total was as low as 12. 9 ng/mL. And, he has {{a low level of}} parathyroid hormone (PTH). Adequate correction for hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia failed to maintain calcium and magnesium to their normal value. Oral calcium gluconolactate and carbonate were added after calcitriol supplementation, but seizure still noticed. After magnesium oxide supplementation was given, another seizure had never occurred. A long-term follow-up on vitamin D and calcium level were required. Conclusion: In a hypocalcemic newborn patient, assessment of the magnesium, vitamin D, and PTH status are needed. </p...|$|E

This condition is associated with an increase of important outcomes in the fetus and newborn. Objectives: Review of gestational {{diabetes mellitus}} physiopathology and the metabolic/hormonal changes that happen in the fetal environment. Review of the impact in the mother, intrauterine environment, fetus and newborn. Results: The maternal metabolic disorders, particularly the hyperglycemia, increase the the risk of intrauterine and neonatal morbidity. This includes macrosomia (large for gestational age), <b>neonatal</b> hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, <b>hypocalcemia,</b> polycythemia and respiratory pathology. Gestacional diabetes mellitus is also {{associated with an increased}} frequency of maternal hypertensive disorders, eclampsia and hydramnios which represent as well, potential risk for the fetal development. The intensive metabolic management is required in order to prevent all these outcomes which include also intrauterine death and prematurity. Women with gestacional diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for the development of diabetes, usually type 2, after pregnancy. Offspring of women with gestacional diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of obesity, glucose intolerance,and diabetes in late adolescence and young adulthood. Conclusion: Gestacional diabetes mellitus is a disease with a complex management although the tight glycemic control is consensually regarded to improve its prognostic.

40|$|Background: There is {{dearth of}} reports from Iran {{regarding}} {{the prevalence of}} postterm pregnancy and its complications. The present {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the prevalence, management and outcome of prolonged pregnancies. Methods: This cross-sectional study included data from the hospital records of all women referred to Shariati Hospital, Tehran, from 2001 to 2002 with pregnancies of more than 40 weeks in duration. Pregnancies &ge; 40 - 42 weeks were considered postdate and those more than 42 weeks postterm pregnancy. The data compiled from the hospital records were subjected to t, &chi; 2 and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: Of the 1500 deliveries in this hospital, 98 patients were included in this study, 66. 3 % of whom were nullipara and 33. 7 % multipara. The prevalence of postterm pregnancy was estimated to be 3. 3 %. Cervix dilation of 2 cm or less on admission occurred in 65 women (73. 3 %). The mean Bishop score was 4. 31. Of the 62 fetuses that underwent assessment tests, 54 (87. 1 %) were normal. The median time between the last test and induction of labor was 2. 1 days, and 2. 6 days for cesarean deliveries, which was not a significant difference (P= 0. 6). Cervical ripening with misoprostrol was performed in 36 cases (36. 7 %) and was successful in 18 cases. In this group, the median time for cervical ripening in multiparas was significantly less than nulliparas (4 vs. 7 hrs, P= 0. 004). Women not subjected to cervical ripening had a higher cesarean rate than those who did undergo cervical ripening (74. 7 % vs. 66. 1 %), although this difference was not significant (P= 0. 9). Vaginal and cesarean delivery rates showed no significant difference between cases that underwent induction with oxytocin and those subjected to cervical ripening with misoprostol (P= 0. 9). The mean Apgar score was 9. 5, with all scores above 6. There were no cases of <b>neonatal</b> hypoglycemia, <b>hypocalcemia,</b> NICU admission or prenatal death. The mean nursery stay was 1. 84 days with a range of 1 - 8 days. Conclusions: The prevalence of postterm pregnancies was 3. 3 % in this study, due in part to erroneous estimation of gestational age. Sonography exam {{in the first half of}} pregnancy can provide a better estimation of gestational age and thereby reduce the rate of postterm pregnancy. Cervical ripening and induction of labor shorten the duration of pregnancy; however, whether it has any beneficial effect on neonatal outcome remains controversial...|$|R

Glibenclamide is rarely used in treating mothers with this disease. This study aimed at comparing {{the effect of}} glibenclamide and insulin on neonatal outcomes in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Methods: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 249 pregnant women aged 18 - 45 years within the 11 th - 33 rd weeks of gestation with gestational diabetes, single fetus pregnancy, {{and in need of}} hyperglycemia treatment were entered and grouped randomly as either glibenclamide or insulin. In the insulin group (n = 129), insulin was administered with an initial dose of 0. 2 IU/kg subcutaneously twice per day, whereas in the glibenclamide group (n = 120), 1. 25 mg oral glibenclamide was administered once daily and increased if needed. Results: The results showed no significant difference in means age, gestational age, and body mass index between women in the two groups. In addition, {{there were no significant differences}} in the frequency of neonatal hypoglycemia, anomaly, hyperbilirubinemia, admission in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and neonatal respiratory distress between two groups. Macrosomia was lower in the glibenclamide group than the insulin group (3. 3 % vs. 13. 2 %, respectively, P = 0. 005). Regression logistics model results showed that the type of treatment (odds ratio [OR]: 4. 62; confidence interval [CI]: 1. 45 - 14. 02; P = 0. 01) and gestational age at delivery (OR: 1. 41; CI: 1. 04 - 1. 74; P = 0. 01) were as predictor factors of macrosomia.

40|$|Zahraa Ezzeldin, Yasmeen Mansi, Tamer A Abdelhamid, Mohamed Sabry Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt Background: It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that phototherapy leads to increased calcium absorption by the bones through irradiating the pineal gland and reducing melatonin level. There {{is some evidence}} that the use of a stockinet cap to cover the head prevents phototherapy-induced hypocalcemia. Study design: This was a randomized controlled trial, including 124 full-term neonates, weighing > 2, 500 g, in the first 7 days of life, who developed a bilirubin level ranging from 15 to 20 mg/dL and needed treatment with phototherapy. Our neonates were divided into two groups: Group A without the hat, and Group B with the hat. We designed a dark-colored hat that covered the entire head, including the occipital area, ears, and neck, to prevent passage of light. The hat was used from the time of admission and for the 48 hours of treatment with phototherapy. Ca levels were measured on admission and after 48 hours of phototherapy. The variables were compared using Student’s t-test, chi-square test, and the repeated-measures test. Results: There was no difference in the mean Ca levels in the two groups on admission. However, after 48 hours of phototherapy, there was a trend toward an increased Ca level in the group with the hat; 8. 74 ± 0. 95 mg/dL vs 8. 51 ± 0. 24 mg/dL in the control group. Moreover, there was a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of neonates with hypocalcemia in Group B (with hat) in only six cases (9. 7 %), compared to 15 cases (24. 2 %) in Group A (without hat; P= 0. 031). Conclusion: Phototherapy-induced hypocalcemia can be prevented by covering the head during phototherapy. This seems to be a safe, effective, and cheap method to prevent hypocalcemia and its complications, with no need for prophylactic administration of calcium.

40|$|PurposeTo {{describe}} the clinical characteristics of full-term neonates with hypocalcemia {{and to suggest}} factors associated with neonatal hypocalcemiaMethodsThe medical records of full-term neonates with hypocalcemia were reviewed. Hypocalcemia {{was defined as a}}n ionized calcium (iCa) concentration of < 4 mg/dL. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) insufficiency was defined as a serum PTH level of < 60 pg/mL or a serum phosphorus level higher than the serum calcium level in the presence of hypocalcemia. ResultsFifty-three neonates were enrolled. The median age at diagnosis of hypocalcemia was 3 days. In all the neonates, formula feeding predominance was observed. Thirty-eight neonates (69. 8 %) were compatible with PTH insufficiency. The number of formula-fed neonates was significantly higher than that of breast-fed patients among neonates with PTH insufficiency (P= 0. 017). Intact PTH was negatively correlated with serum phosphorus levels. Twelve out of 14 neonates (85. 7 %) had 25 -hydroxy vitamin D (25 OHD) levels < 20 ng/mL and 9 neonates (64. 3 %) had 25 OHD levels < 10 ng/mL. Twenty-one neonates had hypocalcemic tetany. The serum calcium and iCa concentrations of neonates with tetany were 4. 2 - 8. 3 mg/dL and 1. 85 - 3. 88 mg/dL, respectively. Three neonates showed symptomatic hypocalcemia with calcium levels over 7. 5 mg/dL. Among the 16 neonates who underwent electroencephalography (EEG), 12 had abnormalities, which normalized after 1 - 2 months. ConclusionFormula milk feeding, PTH insufficiency and low serum vitamin D concentration are associated with the development of <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcemia.</b> Symptoms such as tetany and QT interval prolongation can develop in relatively mild hypocalcemia.

40|$|The interrelationships between {{magnesium}} and {{carbohydrate metabolism}} have regained considerable interest {{over the last}} few years. Insulin secretion requires magnesium: magnesium deficiency results in impaired insulin secretion while magnesium replacement restores insulin secretion. Furthermore, experimental magnesium deficiency reduces the tissues sensitivity to insulin. Subclinical magnesium deficiency is common in diabetes. It results from both insufficient magnesium intakes and increase magnesium losses, particularly in the urine. In type 2, or non-insulin-dependent, diabetes mellitus, magnesium deficiency seems to be associated with insulin resistance. Furthermore, it may participate in the pathogenesis of diabetes complications and may contribute to the increased risk of sudden death associated with diabetes.

MethodsFrom 1995 to 2006, 21 patients under 3 months of age were admitted to our department because of late-onset <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcemia.</b> Among these, five were noted to have transient hypocalcemia, hyper-phosphatemia and elevated serum parathyroid hormone levels. Their clinical data, biochemical findings and natural course were thoroughly analyzed. ResultsAll five patients were boys with increased neuromuscular irritability as their initial clinical manifestation. Initial biochemical data showed calcium 1. 5 ± 0. 16 mmol/L, phosphorus 9. 6 ± 1. 5 mg/dL, intact parathyroid hormone 182 ± 93 pg/mL and tubular reabsorption of phosphorus 94. 8 ± 3. 7 %. Two of the patients had magnesium deficiency. After reduction of phosphorus intake and supplementation with calcium and/or magnesium as indicated, the biochemical derangements resolved in 28 ± 3 days. ConclusionNeuromuscular irritability is usually the initial clinical presentation of transient pseudohypoparathyroidism. Aside from delayed renal maturation, pseudohypoparathyroidism is also caused by magnesium deficiency. Such a disturbance usually resolves before 3 months of age...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the clinical manifestations at diagnosis and during follow-up {{in patients with}} 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome to better define {{the natural history of}} the disease. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective and prospective multicenter study was conducted with 228 patients {{in the context of the}} Italian Network for Primary Immunodeficiencies. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed by cytogenetic or molecular analysis. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 112 males and 116 females; median age at diagnosis was 4 months (range 0 to 36 years 10 months). The diagnosis was made before 2 years of age in 71 % of patients, predominantly related to the presence of heart anomalies and <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcemia.</b> In patients diagnosed after 2 years of age, clinical features such as speech and language impairment, developmental delay, minor cardiac defects, recurrent infections, and facial features were the main elements leading to diagnosis. During follow-up (available for 172 patients), the frequency of autoimmune manifestations (P =. 015) and speech disorders (P =. 002) increased. After a median follow-up of 43 months, the survival probability was 0. 92 at 15 years from diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a delay in the diagnosis of 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome with noncardiac symptoms. This study provides guidelines for pediatricians and specialists for early identification of cases that can be confirmed by genetic testing, which would permit the provision of appropriate clinical management...|$|E

40|$|Specific {{types and}} subtypes of cardiac defects have been {{described}} in children with 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome {{as well as in}} other genetic syndromes. The conotruncal heart defects occurring in patients with 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome include tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, truncus arteriosus, interrupted aortic arch, isolated anomalies of the aortic arch, and ventricular septal defect. These conotruncal heart defects are frequently associated in this syndrome with additional cardiovascular anomalies of the aortic arch, pulmonary arteries, infundibular septum, and semilunar valves complicating cardiac anatomy and surgical treatment. In this review we describe the surgical anatomy, the operative treatment, and the prognostic results of the cardiac defects associated with 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome. According to the current literature, in patients with tetralogy of Fallot with/without pulmonary atresia and truncus arteriosus, in spite of the complex cardiac anatomy, the presence of 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome does not worsen the surgical prognosis. On the contrary in children with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and probably in those with interrupted aortic arch the association with 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome is probably a risk factor for the operative treatment. The complex cardiovascular anatomy in association with depressed immunological status, pulmonary vascular reactivity, <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcemia,</b> bronchomalacia and broncospasm, laryngeal web, and tendency to airway bleeding must be considered at the time of diagnosis and surgical procedure. Specific diagnostic, surgical, and perioperative protocols should be applied in order to provide appropriate treatment and to reduce surgical mortality and morbidity. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D {{and bone}} mineral {{metabolism}} during pregnancy were studied in 17 diabetic and 13 control BB rats. On day 21 of pregnancy, reduced mean levels of 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3; 56. 9 vs. 97. 9 pg/ml; P less than 0. 0001] and vitamin D-binding protein (304 vs. 482 micrograms/ml; P less than 0. 0001) {{were found in}} the diabetic rats, while the free 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 concentration was not different from the control level. Total plasma calcium and total plasma protein concentrations were also significantly decreased in the diabetic group, but the calculated diffusible calcium was not significantly lower. Calcium and phosphorus urinary excretion were increased in the diabetic rats. There was no difference in bone mineral content. The fetuses of the diabetic BB rat had a lower body weight and were hypoinsulinemic. Both 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 (41. 3 vs. 54. 7 pg/ml; P less than 0. 01) and vitamin D-binding protein (80 vs. 123 micrograms/ml; P less than 0. 001) were decreased in the fetuses of diabetic rats, but the free 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 concentration was slightly but significantly (6. 96 vs. 5. 54; P less than 0. 05) increased. We observed that the fetuses of diabetic rats had fewer ossification centers, counted with the Alizarin Red S staining method. The fetal ash weight was lower in the diabetic group (16. 7 vs. 26. 9 mg; P less than 0. 0001). In addition, the relative calcium and phosphorus, but not magnesium, content of ash was lower in the fetuses of diabetic rats. This reduced mineral content in fetuses of diabetic mothers could be implicated in the pathogenesis of early <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcemia</b> in infants of diabetic mothers. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Hypocalcemia is a {{frequent}} abnormality that {{has been associated with}} disease severity and outcome in hospitalized foals. However, the pathogenesis of equine <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcemia</b> is poorly understood. Hypovitaminosis D in critically ill people has been linked to hypocalcemia and mortality; however, information on vitamin D metabolites and their association with clinical findings and outcome in critically ill foals is lacking. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (hypovitaminosis D) and its association with serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations, disease severity, and mortality in hospitalized newborn foals. One hundred newborn foals ≤ 72 hours old divided into hospitalized (n = 83; 59 septic, 24 sick non-septic [SNS]) and healthy (n = 17) groups were included. Blood samples were collected on admission to measure serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 [25 (OH) D 3], 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3], and PTH concentrations. Data were analyzed by nonparametric methods and univariate logistic regression. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D [defined as 25 (OH) D 3 < 9. 51 ng/mL] was 63 % for hospitalized, 64 % for septic, and 63 % for SNS foals. Serum 25 (OH) D 3 and 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 concentrations were significantly lower in septic and SNS compared to healthy foals (P< 0. 0001; P = 0. 037). Septic foals had significantly lower calcium and higher phosphorus and PTH concentrations than healthy and SNS foals (P< 0. 05). In hospitalized and septic foals, low 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 concentrations were associated with increased PTH but not with calcium or phosphorus concentrations. Septic foals with 25 (OH) D 3 < 9. 51 ng/mL and 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 < 7. 09 pmol/L were more likely to die (OR= 3. 62; 95 % CI = 1. 1 - 12. 40; OR = 5. 41; 95 % CI = 1. 19 - 24. 52, respectively). Low 25 (OH) D 3 and 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 concentrations are associated with disease severity and mortality in hospitalized foals. Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to a pro-inflammatory state in equine perinatal diseases. Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia together with decreased 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 but increased PTH concentrations in septic foals indicates that PTH resistance may be associated with the development of these abnormalities...|$|E
