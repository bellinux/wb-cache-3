5|$|A {{tropical}} depression developed between the Cape Verde islands {{and the west}} coast of Africa on August18, although it was <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> as a tropical cyclone for another week. The depression tracked west-southwestward for three days, followed by a turn to the west and later west-northwest. Late on August24 it intensified into a tropical storm about 700mi (1100km) east-northeast of Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles. The next day, the Miami Weather Bureau Office initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Able after the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the presence of a poorly defined center. Continuing to the west-northwest, the storm passed north of Puerto Rico and attained hurricane status on August27.|$|E
5|$|As Delia {{neared the}} Texas coastline, it managed to intensify into a strong {{tropical}} storm with winds of 70mph (110km/h) and reconnaissance reported winds well {{in excess of}} hurricane-force in numerous squalls associated with the storm. The lowest pressure was recorded at 986mbar (hPa; 29.11inHg). However, Delia was <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> a hurricane as it had not developed an eyewall around the center of circulation. Delia subsequently made its first landfall at Freeport, Texas late on September4. After executing a counterclockwise loop, the storm made its second landfall in Freeport on September5. After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened, becoming a depression on September6 before dissipating early the next day over northern Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Characterized with disorganized convection, a broad surface trough {{formed in}} {{association}} with the wave the same day and environmental conditions were expected to favor gradual development. Initially, upper-level winds were only marginally favorable, and although the thunderstorms remained disorganized, the NHC estimated a 50%chance for development by early on October12. The next day, the system became better defined, and, the NHC noted that the system {{was on the verge of}} becoming a tropical cyclone. Although operationally <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> until 2100UTC on October 13, a post-season analysis conducted on the system revealed that it attained enough organization to be considered a tropical depression at 1200UTC, while positioned about 645mi (1040km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them {{on the basis of}} similarities. In 1962, Andr√© Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the Linnaean hierarchical system. This system bases classification on phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. Later the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was formed. However, viruses are <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> on the basis of phylum or class, as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond order. As such, the Baltimore classification is used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, the Australians won {{all three}} of their {{first-class}} matches against the hosts' provincial teams. The Australians then played against a New Zealand representative team, although the matches were <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> as Tests. In the first game, Craig scored an unbeaten 123 in the second innings to ensure a draw after the visitors had conceded a first innings lead. In the second match, Australia stumbled to 6/146 in their second innings after conceding a first innings lead of 34. After the unconvincing performances {{in the first two}} matches, Craig scored 57 in the third, which Australia won by ten wickets. Craig ended with 224 runs at 56.00 in the three international matches and 308 runs at 38.50 overall.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, a purported {{new species}} of Streptococcus, named S.shiloi, was {{identified}} {{as one of the}} causes of an epidemic of meningoencephalitis (an inflammation of the brain and its surrounding membranes) affecting farmed rainbow trout and tilapia in Israel since 1986. Since S.shiloi was alpha-hemolytic, had a G+C% content of 37% and did not ferment sugar galactose, it was <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> as S.iniae, which is beta-hemolytic, has a G+C% content of 32%, and ferments galactose. In 1995, S.shiloi was found in fact to be beta-hemolytic, and after DNA-DNA hybridization techniques with the ATCC type S.iniae and recalculation of the G+C% content, was reclassified by the same group as a junior synonym of S.iniae.|$|E
5|$|On April 21, a {{low-pressure}} area {{separated from}} the prevailing westerlies about 600miles (1,100km) southeast of Bermuda, and developed into a subtropical depression at 1200UTC. The system maintained a large comma-shaped cloud pattern around the low-level circulation. Operationally, it was <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> until 27hours later. Isolated from strong steering currents, the depression tracked northwestward at 12mph (19km/h), and intensified into a subtropical storm early on April 22; {{this was the first}} such storm on record in the month. It gradually became better organized, with a large convective band in the eastern semicircle. Reports from a nearby ship indicated peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), with swells of 64.4feet (19.7m).|$|E
5|$|On Lanzarote a {{somewhat}} {{larger number of}} these birds still seem to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: Probably less than three hundred and perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain. Similarly, the birds on the western Canary Islands which are usually assigned to the nominate subspecies have declined much, and here wanton destruction seems still to be significant. On Tenerife they seem relatively numerous {{but on the other}} islands, the situation looks about as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to their assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland Spain, the western Canary Islands population is <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> as threatened.|$|E

5|$|Substantial {{structural}} changes {{took place on}} January12: frontal boundaries separated from {{the core of the}} cyclone; convection developed atop the circulation; and it acquired a weak warm-core. All these factors, alongside the system being co-located with an upper-level low, indicated its transition into a subtropical cyclone by 18:00UTC. Upon doing so, the system received the name Alex. Though relatively shallow, owing to the seasonally low level of the tropopause, convection was deemed deep enough for classification. At this time, the subtropical storm was situated 1,150mi (1,850km) west-southwest of the Canary Islands. The trough that previously enabled the sharp southward turn later steered Alex to the east-northeast and later north-northeast. Operationally, Alex was <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> as a subtropical storm until late on January13.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{infection}} is Escherichia coli, though other bacteria or fungi may rarely be the cause. Risk factors include female anatomy, sexual intercourse, diabetes, obesity, and family history. Although sexual intercourse is a risk factor, UTIs are <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Kidney infection, if it occurs, usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a blood-borne infection. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. In those with vague symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection. In complicated cases or if treatment fails, a urine culture may be useful.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Alberto {{produced}} significant {{rainfall and}} flooding in the Southeastern United States, damaging or destroying over 18,000 homes. In August, Tropical Storm Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, with moderate to heavy rainfall throughout several other states. Beryl caused numerous injuries, {{many of which}} occurred from a tornado associated with the tropical storm. Tropical Storm Debby killed nine people in the Caribbean in September. Hurricane Gordon was the most significant storm of the season, causing damage from Costa Rica to North Carolina among its six landfalls. Extreme flooding and mudslides from Gordon caused approximately 1,122fatalities in Haiti. In addition, a nor'easter in December may have had tropical characteristics, though due to the uncertainty, it was <b>not</b> <b>classified</b> as a tropical system.|$|E
