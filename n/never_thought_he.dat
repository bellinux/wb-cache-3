500|$|DeJoseph left, {{leaving the}} band without a drummer. Mark O'Connell, {{a friend of}} Reyes, heard about the vacancy and joined the group. After {{recording}} Taking Back Sunday's self-titled EP, Longo left the band and eventually played with Guilt Like Gravity and the Mirror. In December 2000, Lazzara switched from bass to lead vocals. He <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would become the group's singer: [...] "I remember getting into [...] Windstar with that [...] and just driving around singing those songs, just to make myself actually do it." [...] O'Connell suggested that the group needed a bassist, and brought in Shaun Cooper of Breaking Pangaea. In February 2001, Taking Back Sunday released a five-track demo before touring for a year.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Dave Hughes {{first started}} working for Adult Swim in 2003 after an eight-year stint with MTV Animation, {{where he had}} edited series such as Beavis and Butt-head and Celebrity Deathmatch. Hughes, who saw Adult Swim [...] "slipping away from its more {{experimental}} roots" [...] as it got popular, had the concept for Off the Air in mind before, but <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{would be the one}} to make it. While living in New York, 120 Minutes, Concrete TV, Liquid Television and Night Flight were among some of the experimental programming that exposed him [...] "to a whole new world of ideas, music and people that I just didn't see anywhere else on television." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{successful}} summer {{followed for}} the Argentine. In July, del Potro {{and his team}} decided to remain in Europe to test his fitness. [...] "We decided to play on clay courts for my back because if I start to play again on hard courts, maybe I will injure it again", he recalled. Del Potro won his first career ATP tour title at the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, defeating Gasquet in straight sets in the final. A week later, del Potro reached his second career ATP Tour final at the Austrian Open in Kitzbühel, where he beat local hope and sixth seed Melzer {{in less than an}} hour, to claim his second title in two weeks. Having competed in just two clay tournaments all of the 2007 season, he <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would win his first two titles on clay courts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{last known}} bank robbery by Machine Gun Kelly, a Prohibition-era gangster, {{took place on}} November 30, 1932 at the Citizen’s State Bank in Tupelo; his gang netted $38,000. After the robbery, the bank’s chief teller said of Kelly, “He {{was the kind of}} guy that, if you looked at him, you would <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was a bank robber.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Wang Tao was {{apparently}} quite moved by his warm welcome in Japan; {{he wrote that}} when he left Japan, he was treated with a grand dinner party attended {{by more than one}} hundred celebrities, and that he <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could become so famous and important, because during his youth at Puli township, he was a nobody. [...] "How lucky I am to get such welcome by foreign scholars several thousand miles away".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 20, Lindh {{decided to}} travel to Afghanistan {{to fight for the}} Afghan Taliban {{government}} forces against Northern Alliance fighters. His parents said that he was moved by stories of atrocities allegedly perpetrated by the Northern Alliance army against civilians. He traveled to Afghanistan in May 2001. Tony West, his lawyer, explained it as follows: [...] "One of the first things he told Army interrogators when they questioned him on December 3, 2001, was that after 9/11 happened, he wanted to leave the front lines but couldn't for fear of his life. [...] John never wanted {{to be in a position}} where he was opposing the United States (and <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would be), and in fact he never opposed any American military." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Ah, my dear Mrs. Beck—!” he vaguely protested, {{using her}} former name quite by accident. At San Pablo he—and {{apparently}} she—had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> whether <b>he</b> respected her or not. That never came up.|$|R
6000|$|... "He hates receptions," [...] the boy replied, [...] "but {{he promised}} he'd come. I <b>never</b> <b>thought,</b> when <b>he</b> used to drill science into {{us at the}} lectures, {{that he was going}} to be such a {{tremendous}} big pot." ...|$|R
50|$|And yet, when {{he meets}} an {{unconventional}} girl named Sandra “Sasa” Sanchez, his world turns upside down. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> could {{fall in love}} with someone who works as a promo-girl and is obviously unacceptable in his life.|$|R
2500|$|They go to a restaurant, where Gigi acts {{the role}} of courtesan {{perfectly}} – perhaps a little too perfectly. Gaston is uncomfortable with her knowledge of the other courtesans, and concerned for Gigi because of the unrelenting attention and judgment of other patrons. Honoré then delivers a crushing blow when he congratulates Gaston on his new courtesan and makes degrading remarks towards Gigi. Gaston, too in love with Gigi to give her this appalling life of uncertainty and judgment, leaves without a word after dragging her home crying. However, he stops a little way {{down the street and}} realizes his love for her is too strong, so he does something he <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would do and he proposes marriage.|$|E
2500|$|Entering high school, Cotton's {{physical}} maturity {{provided him}} the size, speed, {{and power to}} dominate his opponents. [...] "He is {{a kid in a}} man's body," [...] said Toby Bailey, who faced a freshman Cotton in the Southern Section Division I-A semifinals in 1994. As a sophomore, Cotton was described by the Chicago Tribune as [...] "already a complete player with upper-body strength of a college senior." [...] However, he did not undergo a second growth spurt. As he grew older, his strength and size were no longer an advantage like they were in high school. Cotton became too short to be a forward, but was not quick enough to defend guards. His jump shot and ball-handling ability were suspect by NBA standards. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could play," [...] said NBA scout Marty Blake.|$|E
2500|$|At this time, {{the band}} first invited Jeff Lynne, {{a friend of}} Wood's, to join. He turned the offer down, as he was still working toward success in the Idle Race, another Birmingham-based group. It was rumoured in the music press that Hank Marvin of the {{recently}} disbanded Shadows {{had been invited to}} join the Move. Some years later, Wayne recalled that to be nothing more than a publicity stunt; however, Marvin himself, in an article in Melody Maker in 1973 and elsewhere, has maintained that he was definitely approached by Wood and invited to join the Move, but declined because their schedule was too hectic for him. Bevan confirmed in a 2014 interview that the band invited Marvin, but they <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would say [...] "yes". Burton was ultimately replaced in 1969 by Rick Price, another veteran of several Birmingham rock groups, who joined on a temporary, non-contractual basis. [...] Thus, the group in spring 1969 consisted of just Wayne (vocals), Wood (guitar), Bevan (drums), and Price (bass).|$|E

50|$|When he was 19, {{he went to}} the gym to do some sparring, {{but never}} went back because he did not want his father to find out. His mother, Andrea Skeete-Foreman, <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> would ever become a boxer because he was so calm and would never lose his temper.|$|R
2500|$|In a November 2009 {{article in}} the Toluca Lake, California, Tolucan Times, {{columnist}} Greg Crosby described a visit with Caesar and his wife Florence at their home. Of the couple's meeting, Florence said, [...] "Well, I thought he was nice for the summer ... I {{thought he would be}} just a nice boyfriend for the summer. He was cute-looking and tall, over six feet.... I was in my last year at Hunter College; we were still dating when Sid went into the service, the Coast Guard. Luckily he was stationed in New York so we were able to continue seeing each other, even though my parents weren't too happy about it. They <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would amount to anything, that he'd never have a real career or make any money. But we were married one year after we met, in July of 1943." [...] She also pointed out, [...] "You know, he's not funny all the time. He can be very serious." [...] At the time of the interview, the couple had been married for 66 years. Florence Caesar died on March 3, 2010, aged 88.|$|E
2500|$|Stan has a {{large amount}} of {{on-screen}} interaction with his family, living at the centre of the family, The Queen Victoria when he permanently arrives on Albert Square. Stan is shown to have an estranged relationship with his eldest daughter, Shirley Carter, played by Linda Henry, with West saying there is [...] "tension" [...] between father and daughter and that makes Stan [...] "very wary of her." [...] Despite this, Stan has a good relationship with his youngest daughter, Tina Carter, played by Luisa Bradshaw-White, and West felt that they had the [...] "best relationship out of the lot of them". West also said how Stan enjoys the warmth and kindness that Tina provides. West felt Stan was [...] "delighted" [...] to see 'son' Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer, again, even though they slightly avoided each other. Mick blames Stan for [...] "things that have gone wrong to him - as well as things that he doesn't know about, things that he is confused about and things he's unhappy about." [...] Dyer praised West and his role as Stan, saying [...] "Tim has brought something to the part that we <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would." [...] West revealed in an interview with Claire Webb of Radio Times that he originally hated his on-screen family, but [...] "now absolutely adores them". When Stan meets Mick's children - Johnny and Nancy, played by Sam Strike and Maddy Hill, in April, he manages to insult Johnny's sexuality, which Johnny does not take well to. Speaking of the meeting, West said: [...] "He likes Johnny but can't really cope with the fact he is gay, but after an initial, very rude couple of outbursts about both Tina and Johnny being gay, he warms to them both." [...] West said that Stan's relationship with his ex-wife, Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe), was [...] "stormy". Marlowe said that Sylvie's arrival is a [...] "big shock" [...] for him because [...] "one minute she's saying something like wanting to run away with him and the next minute she's saying, 'Who?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Of large build, ruddy countenance and of cheery disposition, Ulyett was {{a typical}} Yorkshireman" [...] He was clean hitter of a cricket ball and a fast bowler with [...] "a high action". Lyttleton also says {{he was not a}} {{particularly}} skilful bowler: [...] "He pounded away straight and hard but I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> used his head much".|$|R

6000|$|... 'It {{nearly killed}} him last year, {{but he never}} had lungs good for anything. First, my aunt set my father against it, and when he gave in, she had a crabbed {{decrepit}} old grandfather, and between them they were the death of her, and almost of him.
