40|$|This PhD {{thesis is}} focused in {{structural}} aspects of alkali nitrates. In the first chapter, we recollected {{the most important}} advancement in this field in alkali nitrates compounds published since 1970. Along this lines, crystal structure, polymorphism and phase transition is discussed first; second, crystal growth, and third, the morphology. And, finally a section concerning solid state miscibility and binary phase diagrams between these compounds is presented. The following chapters present a deeper study of growth morphology and how the impurities affect to the morphology and growth rate. These two topics are closely related because the growth morphology {{is a consequence of}} the growth rate ratio of different faces. Evidently, we chose only one compound of all the alkali nitrate family. It turned to be sodium nitrate, <b>nitratine</b> or NaNO 3. First, in chapter 2, we calculate the morphology of <b>nitratine</b> by applying the two most common approaches to determine the theoretic morphology of crystals: the Bravais-Friedel-Donnay-Harker (BFDH) methodology and the periodic bond chains (PBCs) procedure proposed by Hartman and Perdok (HP). Then we compare the obtained morphology with the experimental growth shape. This compound is interesting from the morphological and structural point of view because it is isostructural with calcite, a calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) polymorph. This fact will permit us to discuss how the charges affect the final crystal morphology; an introduction to this question is in chapter 2. In chapter 3 we sought to determination of the normal growth rates (R 104) of { 104 } faces of sodium nitrate single crystals under isothermal conditions in the temperature interval 288 K  297. 5 K and hence find the most probable growth mechanisms. Chapter 4 is devoted to the morphology change in NaNO 3 crystals by the effect of impurities. It is followed by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigation of heterogeneous nucleation of <b>nitratine</b> on calcite in chapter 5. Finally, the NaNO 3 – KNO 3 phase diagram has been studied from both experimental and theoretical aspects in chapter 6...|$|E

40|$|Present work {{provides}} in-situ {{structural data}} at a fine temperature scale from RT to the melting point of <b>nitratine,</b> NaNO 3. From {{the analysis of}} log e (33) versus log t plots, {{it is possible to}} prove that an univocal indication on the R (3) over barc (low temperature, LT) -> R (3) over bar m (high temperature, HT) transition mechanism cannot be obtained because of the relevant role played by the arbitrary assumptions required for defining the c (0) dependence from temperature of the HT phase. This is due to the occurrence of excess thermal expansion for the HT phase. A significantly better fit for an Ising-spin structural model over a non-Ising rigid-body one has been obtained for the LT phase. Moreover, the Ising model led to a smooth variation of the oxygen site x fractional coordinate throughout the transition. The structure of the HT polymorph has been successfully refined considering an oxygen site at x, 0, A 1 / 2, with 50 % occupancy. Such model was the only acceptable one from the crystal chemical point of view as the alternative model (oxygen site at x, y, z with 25 % occupancy) led to unrealistically aplanar NO 3 - groups...|$|E

40|$|The Old Bridge Elche’s showed {{abundant}} efflorescence {{and salt}} crusts that were eliminated in an intervention in 2005. We {{have followed the}} development of efflorescence after the intervention. And nine years later the efflorescence mineralogy was quite similar to the mineralogy of the pre-restoration efflorescence. The efflorescence on Elche’s Old Bridge (Puente Viejo) shows a wide mineralogical variation in the vertical profile, {{which is the result}} of a balance between two diffusive processes: the evaporation–condensation of atmospheric water vapor on/inside the wall, and the capillary flow of saline groundwater. Diurnal variations in atmospheric relative humidity (RH) and the low deliquescence relative humidity (DRH) values of some saline minerals (nitrate & chloride) play an important role in the vertical distribution of minerals. The mineral composition of efflorescence and saline crusts prior to cleaning the monument was similar to that identified nine years later. The chemical composition of groundwater, with a high sodium chloride component and much lower concentrations of sulfate and bicarbonate, explained the presence of halite, while the presence of demolition waste of a gypsiferous nature near the bridge explained the presence of sulfate salts, thenardite, konyaite, aphthitalite, and arcanite.

Solution chemistry, condensed vapor chemistry, and precipitate mineralogy were used to identify important chemical divides and to validate geochemical calculations of evaporating water chemistry using a high temperature Pitzer thermodynamic database. The water evolved towards a complex ''sulfate type'' brine that contained about 45 mol% Na, 40 mol% Cl, 9 mol% NO{sub 3 }, 5 mol% K, and less than 1 mol% each of SO{sub 4 }, Ca, Mg, {Sigma}CO{sub 2 }(aq), F, and Si. All measured ions in the condensed vapor phase were below detection limits. The mineral precipitates identified were halite, anhydrite, bassanite, niter and <b>nitratine.</b> Trends in the solution composition and identification of CaSO{sub 4 } solids suggest that fluorite, carbonate, sulfate, and magnesium-silicate precipitation control the aqueous solution composition of sulfate type waters by removing fluoride, calcium, and magnesium during the early stages of evaporation. In most cases, the high temperature Pitzer database, used by EQ 3 / 6 geochemical code, sufficiently predicts water composition and mineral precipitation during evaporation. Predicted solution compositions are generally within a factor of two of the experimental values.

40|$|National audienceThe {{objective}} of this work is to define a set of Pitzer [1] interaction parameters for the Na-SO 4 -NO 3 -OH-H 2 O quaternary system, at 25 °C and different pH conditions, up to the solubility of any salt of the chemical system, including mirabilite (Na 2 SO 4 : 10 H 2 O), thenardite (Na 2 SO 4), <b>nitratine</b> (NaNO 3) and darapskite (Na 2 SO 4 :NaNO 3 :H 2 O). The prediction of this double-salt solubility {{is of particular interest}} {{within the framework of the}} nuclear waste storage [2]. To our knowledge, only one author proposes experimental data of darapskite solubility in alkaline solutions up to 3 m hydroxide at 25 °C [2]. Practically, describing the measured solubility of this mineral is not immediate and requires a step-by-step approach. First, the main work consists of describing accurately the Na 2 SO 4 -H 2 O, NaNO 3 -H 2 O and NaOH-H 2 O binary systems. The interaction parameters for these three systems are taken from literature. They were established in previous studies [3, 4] from measurement data of heat capacity and osmotic coefficient. Due to the high solubility of NaOH (about 28 mol·kg- 1 at 25 °C) the partial dissociation of NaOH is considered. For the NaNO 3 -H 2 O binary system, several studies propose a set of Pitzer interaction parameters. In this study, we chose the interaction parameters published by Marion [5], because the brine properties such as the osmotic coefficient are correctly represented with only two interaction parameters. Although the interaction parameters are determined up to the salts solubility, i. e. 1. 98 mol·kg- 1 for the Na 2 SO 4 -H 2 O binary system and 10. 8 mol·kg- 1 for the NaNO 3 -H 2 O binary system, they can be used beyond this concentration range. Indeed, they are able to correctly represent the osmotic coefficient in supersaturated solutions, up to 6 mol·kg- 1 for the Na 2 SO 4 -H 2 O system and to 15 mol·kg- 1 for the NaNO 3 -H 2 O system, showing the robustness of the models. Then, the fitting work consists of optimizing the ternary interaction parameters on the solubility data of minerals. Finally, the aqueous properties and chemical equilibrium model including dissolution/precipitation mechanisms of the Na-SO 4 -NO 3 -OH-H 2 O quaternary system can be described without supplementary parameters.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of preparation and characterization of chemical plugs based on selected Hanford Site waste simulants. Included are the results of chemical plug bench testing conducted in support of the M 1 /M 6 Flow Loop Chemical Plugging/Unplugging Test (TP-RPP-WTP- 495 Rev A). These results support the proposed plug simulants for the chemical plugging/ unplugging tests. Based on the available simulant data, a set of simulants was identified that would likely result in chemical plugs. The three types of chemical plugs that were generated and tested in this task consisted of: 1. Aluminum hydroxide (NAH), 2. Sodium aluminosilicate (NAS), and 3. Sodium aluminum phosphate (NAP). While both solvents, namely 2 molar (2 M) nitric acid (HNO 3) and 2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 60 °C, used in these tests were effective in dissolving the chemical plugs, the 2 M nitric acid was significantly more effective in dissolving the NAH and NAS plugs. The caustic was only slightly more effecting at dissolving the NAP plug. In the bench-scale dissolution tests, hot (60 °C) 2 M nitric acid was the most effective solvent in that it completely dissolved both NAH and NAS chemical plugs much faster (1. 5 – 2 x) than 2 M sodium hydroxide. So unless there are operational benefits for the use of caustic verses nitric acid, 2 M nitric acid heated to 60 °C C should be the solvent of choice for dissolving these chemical plugs. Flow-loop testing was planned to identify a combination of parameters such as pressure, flush solution, composition, and temperature that would effectively dissolve and flush each type of chemical plug from preformed chemical plugs in 3 -inch-diameter and 4 -feet-long pipe sections. However, based on a review {{of the results of the}} bench-top tests and technical discussions, the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) Research and Technology (R&T), Engineering and Mechanical Systems (EMS), and Operations concluded that flow-loop testing of the chemically plugged pipe sections would not provide any additional information or useful data. The decision was communicated through a Sub Contract Change Notice (SCN- 070) that included a revised scope as follows: • Photographing the chemical plugs in the pipes before extrusion to compare the morphology of aged gels with that of fresh gels. • Setting up an extrusion apparatus and extruding the chemical plugs. • Documenting the qualitative observations on the efforts to remove the chemical plug materials from the pipe sections. • Performing X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of extruded gel samples to detect any crystallization of gel during storage. • Disposing of the extruded gel as a waste. • Documenting the analytical results in a test report. There were no significant morphological differences between the fresh and aged plugs except for an overgrowth of small transparent crystals on the surface of the aged NAS gel plug. An initial pressure of 15 KPa for the NAS plug and from ~ 2 to 6 KPa for the NAH plug. Following extrusion, the NAP plug sections were thixotropic. The bulk of all the aged gel plugs consisted of amorphous material with <b>nitratine</b> constituting the crystalline phase. A separate question about the whether the current in-tank waste conditions will bound the future multi-tank blended feed conditions for the Waste Treatment Plant is outside the scope of this study...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScFly ash is {{the major}} waste {{material}} produced by power plants in the combustion of coal to generate electricity. The main constituents of fly ash are Si, Al, Fe and Ca with smaller amount of S, Mn, Na, K, and traces of many other elements such as Co, Cd, As, Se, Zn, Mo, Pb, B, Cu and Ni. Fly ash is usually disposed either by dry or wet disposal methods. These disposal methods have raised major environmental concerns due to the potential leaching of chemical species from the ash heap by ingress of rainfall and brine used to transport the fly ash to the dam. This study focuses on the changes in chemical composition, morphology and mineral phases due to weathering, of coal fly ash co-disposed with brine over 20 years at Sasol Secunda ash dump in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. The design and operation of the Secunda ash dump presupposes that the ash dump may act as a sink for the salts which originated from chemicals used for normal operation in the plants. The majority of these salts come from the brines generated during desalination and raw water regeneration. The {{aim of this study}} is to ascertain if the ash dump could serve as a sustainable salt sink. Samples were drawn along the depth of two drilled cores (S 1 and S 3) from the weathered Secunda ash dump and analysed in conjunction with the fresh (unweathered) Secunda fly ash taken from the fly ash hoppers for comparative analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractive (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry were employed to obtain a detailed morphological, mineralogical and bulk chemical composition of all the samples. Pore water analysis was used to determine the pH, EC and moisture content of fly ash samples. A five step sequential chemical extraction procedure was used to establish the geochemical association of particular elements with various mineral phases. The total acid digestion test was also used to determine the total elemental compositions of the Secunda fly ash samples. The SEM results showed that the fly ashes consist of irregular and numerous spherically shaped particles. Changes (encrustations, etchings and corrosion) in the morphologies of the weathered ash particles were also observed. The XRD results revealed quartz, mullite, lime and calcite as the major mineral phases. Other minerals identified in very minor quantities in the drilled Secunda ash core that were dried prior to analysis were halite, kaolinite, <b>nitratine,</b> bassanite, microline. and hydrophitte. These phases may have formed during sample handling. XRF investigation revealed that the major oxides present in the dumped ash samples were SiO₂, A₂ 2 O₃, CaO, Fe₂O₃, MgO, Na₂O, TiO₂ and the minor elements present were K₂O, P₂O₅, SO₃ and MnO. The sum of the mean values of the % composition of SiO₂, Al₂O₃, and Fe₂O₃ was 70. 19 %, and 72. 94 % for the two drilled ash core samples (S 1 and S 3) respectively, and 78. 67 % for the fresh ash which shows the significant alteration of the Si, Al and Fe content in the ash matrix over time. The fly ash is classified as Class F using the ASTM C 618 standards. The loss on ignition (LOI) which is an indication of unburned carbon or organic content was 4. 78 %, 13. 45 % and 8. 32 % for the fresh ash, drilled ash cores S 1 and S 3 respectively. The high LOI values for the drilled ash cores could indicate high hydrocarbon content in the ash dump because of co-disposal practises where hydrocarbon waste are included in the brine stream for disposal on the ash. While the ash samples from the surface appeared dry, moisture content (MC) analysis showed that there is considerable water entrained in the fly ash dump. The fresh ash MC was 1. 8 % while core S 1 ranged from 41. 4 – 73. 2 %; core S 3 ranged from 21. 7 – 76. 4 %. The variations in the MC values can be attributed to uneven flow paths due to inconsistent placement conditions or variations in ambient weather conditions during placement. The fresh fly ash (n= 3) had a pH of 12. 38 ± 0. 15, EC value of 4. 98 ± 0. 03 mS/cm and TDS value of 2. 68 ± 0. 03 g/L, the pH of the drilled ash core S 1 (n= 35) was 10. 04 ± 0. 50, the EC value was 1. 08 ± 0. 14 mS/cm and the TDS value was 0. 64 ± 0. 08 g/L. Core S 3 (n= 66) had pH of 11. 04 ± 0. 09; EC was 0. 99 ± 0. 03 and TDS was 0. 57 ± 0. 01. The changes in pH values can be attributed to the dissolution and flushing out from the dump basic alkaline oxides like CaO and MgO These variations in pH values shows that the fly ash is acidifying over time and metal mobility can be expected under these conditions. The large decrease of EC in the drilled ash cores S 1 and S 3 compared to the fresh ash indicated a major loss of ionic species over time in the ash dump. The sequential extraction scheme revealed that the elements Al, Si, Ca, Mg, Ba, Sr, Fe, Mn, Na, K, As, Pb, Cr, Mo, Cu, Ni and Zn are present in Secunda fresh and weathered fly ash and are partitioned between the water soluble, exchangeable, carbonate, iron and manganese, and residual fractions of the coal fly ash. It also showed that the trace elements As, Pb, Cr, Mo, Cu, Ni and Zn do not show permanent association with particular mineral phases as a continuous partitioning between different mineral phases was observed in the weathered drilled core. Generally, all the elements had the highest concentration in the residual fraction. But it was evident that the labile phase (water soluble, exchangeable and carbonate fractions) had fairly high concentrations of Si (± 6. 5 %), Al (± 6. 5 %), Ca (± 10 %), Mg (± 5. 5 %), Ba (± 7. 5 %),Sr (± 7. 5 %), Na (± 12 %) and K (± 12 %) for the Secunda drilled ash core (S 1 and S 3) and fresh fly ash samples. This indicates that these species can leach easily upon water ingress and could pose a danger to the environment. Na and K had the highest concentrations leached out in the labile phase in all the ash samples. The amount of Na leached out of the drilled Secunda ash core in the labile phase was 13. 21 % of 18584. 26 mg/kg in the five geochemical phases of core S 1; and 9. 59 % of 11600. 17 mg/kg in the five geochemical phases of core S 3 while the fresh Secunda fly ash leached out 11. 28 % of 16306. 30 mg/kg of Na in the five geochemical phases. This study provided significant insight into the pore water chemistry, morphology, mineralogy and chemical composition and the elemental distribution pattern of the major and trace elements in the Secunda fly ash and weathered drilled Secunda ashm core S 1 and S 3. Though results from XRF analysis and the sequential extraction scheme shows that Na, K, S, Ca and Mg were slightly captured from the co-disposed brine by the Secunda fly ash, these species were however released in the labile phase. Hence there was no significant retention of these species in the ash dump. The amount of these species retained in the weathered ash were (0. 26 % and 0. 55 %) for Na, (0. 02 % and 0. 34 %) for K, (0. 08 % and 0. 06 %) for S, (0. 94 % and 0. 01 %) for Ca and (0. 37 % and 0. 96 %) for Mg in drilled ash cores S 1 and S 3 respectively. This poor retention of Na K, S, Ca and Mg which are major components of Sasol Secunda brine in the drilled ash cores S 1 and S 3 clearly shows the unsustainability of the Secunda fly ash dump as a salt sink...|$|E
