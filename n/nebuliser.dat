In total, 42 CF patients were studied. During two consecutive home visits, a questionnaire regarding routine patient practice was completed by a nurse while sputum and equipment samples were taken for bacteriological analyses. The first visit took place at baseline, and the second followed the implementation of detailed instructions for cleaning and disinfecting the <b>nebulisers</b> using a 0. 5 % hypochlorite solution. The first visit identified a great diversity in routine patient practices. Commensal bacteria, environmental bacteria and potential. CF pathogens contaminated 78. 5 %, 57. 1 % and 14. 3 % of <b>nebulisers</b> respectively. After hypochlorite disinfection, rate and degree of global contamination decreased significantly, but the number of CF pathogens was not affected. There was no concordance between CF pathogens isolated from patients' sputum and their equipment. We conclude that in this sample of patients, initial routine practices were varied. With regard to CF pathogens, the superiority of a hypochlorite solution over a mix of other disinfection methods was not demonstrated. (C) 2009 The Hospital Infection Society.

50|$|To {{maximise}} {{plasma temperature}} (and hence ionisation efficiency) and stability, the sample should be introduced through the central tube {{with as little}} liquid (solvent load) as possible, and with consistent droplet sizes. A <b>nebuliser</b> {{can be used for}} liquid samples, followed by a spray chamber to remove larger droplets, or a desolvating <b>nebuliser</b> can be used to evaporate most of the solvent before it reaches the torch. Solid samples can also be introduced using laser ablation. The sample enters the central channel of the ICP, evaporates, molecules break apart, and then the constituent atoms ionise. At the temperatures prevailing in the plasma a significant proportion of the atoms of many chemical elements are ionized, each atom losing its most loosely bound electron to form a singly charged ion. The plasma temperature is selected to maximise ionisation efficiency for elements with a high first ionisation energy, while minimising second ionisation (double charging) for elements that have a low second ionisation energy.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the output of salbutamol nebulised in combination with either flunisolide or beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) from two different <b>nebulisers</b> under simulated breathing conditions. The BimboNeb and Nebula <b>nebulisers</b> were used to nebulise 3. 0 mL of the two drug mixtures (salbutamol, 5000 μg plus either flunisolide, 600 μg, or BDP, 800 μg). Particle size was determined by inertial impaction. Total outputs of all drugs from both <b>nebulisers</b> were measured using a sinus flow pump under simulated paediatric and adult breathing patterns. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of BDP particles from the mixture was 6. 34 μm using the BimboNeb and 5. 34 μm using the Nebula. Values for salbutamol in this mixture were 3. 93 and 3. 32 μm, respectively. The MMAD of flunisolide particles from the BimboNeb and Nebula were 3. 74 and 3. 65 μm, respectively, while for salbutamol were 3. 79 and 3. 74 μm, respectively. With the simulated adult breathing pattern, all drug outputs from both mixtures were greater from the BimboNeb than from the Nebula after 5 and 10 min' nebulisation. Drug delivery from the BimboNeb, but not the Nebula, was affected by the simulated breathing pattern. Outputs with the BimboNeb were lower with the paediatric breathing pattern than with the adult pattern. In the majority of cases, nebulising for 10 min produced significantly greater drug output than after 5 min. For the Nebula, outputs were generally similar at 5 and 10 min, irrespective of the breathing pattern. These results highlight the need to assess the amount of aerosolised drug available when drugs are combined, when different <b>nebulisers</b> are used and when they are used with patients of different ages...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{droplets}} {{produced by}} <b>nebulisers</b> and respiratory activities Key Messages 1. The size of large droplets produced during respiratory {{activities such as}} coughing can be larger than 50 - 100 µm. These droplets tend to evaporate quickly and contribute to both airborne and droplet transmission of disease. 2. Large droplets from respiratory act ivi t ies can travel up to 1. 5 m, which agrees well with the established range of infection due to droplet transmission. The distance between beds should be greater than 1. 5 m. 3. Large droplets cannot be removed effectively from a room using currently available ventilation systems. Such droplets leave the air via surface deposition on floors, beds, and the patient’s body, etc. 4. Taking nasopharyngeal aspirates can stimulate coughing and promote aerosol generation. 5. <b>Nebulisers</b> generate very fine droplets (< 1 µm) and large volumes can escape through the holes in ventilator facemasks.

50|$|The {{most common}} method {{is the use}} of {{analytical}} nebulizers. Nebulizer converts liquids into an aerosol, and that aerosol can then be swept into the plasma to create the ions. Nebulizers work best with simple liquid samples (i.e. solutions). However, there have been instances of their use with more complex materials like a slurry. Many varieties of nebulizers have been coupled to ICP-MS, including pneumatic, cross-flow, Babington, ultrasonic, and desolvating types. The aerosol generated is often treated to limit it to only smallest droplets, commonly by means of a Peltier cooled double pass or cyclonic spray chamber. Use of autosamplers makes this easier and faster, especially for routine work and large numbers of samples. A Desolvating <b>Nebuliser</b> (DSN) may also be used; this uses a long heated capillary, coated with a fluoropolymer membrane, to remove most of the solvent and reduce the load on the plasma. Matrix removal introduction systems are sometimes used for samples, such as seawater, where the species of interest are at trace levels, and are surrounded by much more abundant contaminants.|$|E

40|$|International audienceInhaled {{antimicrobial}} agents {{are used for}} the treatment of respiratory tract infections due to Gram-negative bacteria, mainly. The effectiveness of the inhaled antimicrobial therapy is believed to correlate with the delivery system used. The objective of this review was to search for data supporting differentiation in clinical effectiveness between systems used for pulmonary delivery of antibiotics, including delivery using disposable <b>nebulisers</b> and oxygen flow. Published studies in peer-reviewed journals comparing the effectiveness of pulmonary drug delivery systems for {{antimicrobial agents}} were retrieved. The studies found were either in vitro or Phase I and Phase II clinical studies. Differences in in vitro parameters may affect the in vivo efficacy of the devices, and in vivo differences may imply differences in clinical effectiveness.

40|$|Antibiotic aerosol {{treatment}} is successful in treating Pseudomonas infection {{in some patients}} with cystic fibrosis, but the amount of drug reaching the lungs is unknown.

40|$|Background: Gene therapy {{mediated}} by synthetic vectors may {{provide opportunities for}} new treatments for cystic fibrosis (CF) via aerosolisation. Vectors for CF must transfect the airway epithelium efficiently and not cause inflammation so they are suitable for repeated dosing.

Optimal delivery of salbutamol occurred with the expiration port between the facemask and <b>nebuliser</b> (647 +/- 67 micro g).

40|$|In {{the thesis}} of Marcel Hoppentocht the {{feasibility}} to treat bacterial infections effectively with inhaled dry powder antibiotics is explored. Most antibiotics are currently administered pulmonary by wet nebulisation or via the parenteral route and both methods have numerous disadvantages. For instance, needle fear {{and the need for}} ‘cold chain storage’ of the drug solution are major drawbacks of parenteral administration. Nebulisation is time-consuming, it requires electricity or pressurised air and this, in addition to their size, makes <b>nebulisers</b> not very portable. Cleaning and disinfection of <b>nebulisers</b> burden patients particularly and this results in poor compliance with the instructions for use of their equipment and negatively affects the therapy.

RTNs nebulised with the AeroEclipse II BAN were the most effective, compared to other <b>nebulisers</b> tested, for gene delivery both in vitro and in vivo. The biophysical properties of the nanocomplexes were unchanged after nebulisation while the deposition of RTNs suggested a range of aerosol aerodynamic sizes between 5. 5 µm- 1. 4 µm cut off (NGI stages 3 - 6) compatible with deposition in the central and lower airways. RTNs showed their ability at delivering genes via nebulisation, thus suggesting their potential applications for therapeutic interventions of cystic fibrosis and other respiratory disorders...|$|R
