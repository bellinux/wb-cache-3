First, the leads are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and the leads are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the background, development {{and testing of}} the Crystal Plaster (CP), which refers to a (crystal) patch in which tiny quartz crystals are the active part in reducing pains. The physical background is the piezoelectric property of bone, i. e. bone subjected to pressure variations generates an electric current. The opposite, the piezoelectric effect is also at work, which means that if bone is subjected to an alternating electro-magnetic radiation then the bone will respond by volume changes and corresponding mechanical stress. The piezoelectric crystals of the CP are in different ways interacting with the corresponding properties of the body. It {{would be possible to}} read out much more of the test results from the CP tests that were made in 2006 - 2007. In any case, the performed study shows clearly that the Crystal Plaster reduces <b>nociceptive</b> <b>pains.</b> We can see that the placebo effect is adding to the results but the test also shows a clear difference between the Placebo and the real Crystal Plaster in favor of the real CP.

40|$|Chronic 'pathological' pain is {{sustained}} by mechanisms of peripheral and central sensitization, {{which are being}} increasingly investigated at the molecular and cellular levels. The molecular determinants of nociceptive sensitization are natural targets for potential analgesic drugs used {{in the treatment of}} different forms of pain. Most of these determinants are common to all forms of chronic pain, and it is therefore not surprising that drugs specifically targeted for the treatment of neuropathic pain are effective in relieving <b>nociceptive</b> inflammatory <b>pain</b> and vice versa. The molecular mechanisms of sensitization that occur in peripheral nociceptors and the dorsal horns of the spinal cord are putative targets for context-dependent drugs, i. e. drugs that are able to discriminate between 'normal' and 'pathological' pain transmission. Among these, pregabalin and gabapentin bind to the alpha(2) delta subunit of voltage-sensitive Ca(2 +) channels, which sustain the enhanced release of pain transmitters at the synapses between primary afferent fibres and second-order sensory neurons under conditions of chronic pain. Pregabalin in particular represents a remarkable example of a context-dependent analgesic drug that acts at a critical step of nociceptive sensitization. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that pregabalin is more than a structural and functional analogue of gabapentin and may be effective in the treatment of <b>nociceptive</b> inflammatory <b>pain</b> that is resistant to gabapentin...|$|R
500|$|In {{the long}} term, {{the loss of}} muscle {{function}} can have additional effects from disuse, including atrophy of the muscle. [...] Immobility can lead to pressure sores, [...] particularly in bony areas, requiring precautions such as extra cushioning and turning in bed every two hours (in the acute setting) to relieve pressure. In the long term, people in wheelchairs must shift periodically to relieve pressure. [...] Another complication is pain, including <b>nociceptive</b> <b>pain</b> (indication of potential or actual tissue damage) and neuropathic pain, when [...] nerves affected by damage convey erroneous pain signals {{in the absence of}} noxious stimuli. Spasticity, the uncontrollable tensing of muscles below the level of injury, occurs in 65–78% of chronic SCI. It results from lack of input from the brain that quells muscle responses to stretch reflexes. [...] It can be treated with drugs and physical therapy. Spasticity increases the risk of contractures (shortening of muscles, tendons, or ligaments that result from lack of use of a limb); this problem can be prevented by moving the limb through its full range of motion multiple times a day. [...] Another problem lack of mobility can cause is loss of bone density and changes in bone structure. Loss of bone density (bone demineralization), thought to be due to lack of input from weakened or paralysed muscles, can increase the risk of fractures. Conversely, a poorly understood phenomenon is the overgrowth of bone tissue in soft tissue areas, [...] called heterotopic ossification. [...] It occurs below the level of injury, possibly as a result of inflammation, and happens to a clinically significant extent in 27% of people.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nociceptive</b> <b>pain</b> {{is caused}} by {{stimulation}} of sensory nerve fibers that respond to stimuli approaching or exceeding harmful intensity (nociceptors), and may be classified according to the mode of noxious stimulation.

2500|$|<b>Nociceptive</b> <b>pain</b> {{may also}} be divided into [...] "visceral", [...] "deep somatic" [...] and [...] "superficial somatic" [...] pain. Visceral {{structures}} are highly sensitive to stretch, ischemia and inflammation, but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain in other structures, such as burning and cutting. Visceral pain is diffuse, difficult to locate and often referred to a distant, usually superficial, structure. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting and may be described as sickening, deep, squeezing, and dull. Deep somatic pain is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, fasciae and muscles, and is dull, aching, poorly-localized pain. Examples include sprains and broken bones. Superficial pain is initiated by activation of nociceptors in the skin or other superficial tissue, and is sharp, well-defined and clearly located. Examples of injuries that produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds and minor (first degree) burns.|$|E

2500|$|Under normal conditions, pain {{conduction}} {{begins with}} some noxious signal {{followed by an}} action potential carried by <b>nociceptive</b> (<b>pain</b> sensing) afferent neurons, which elicit excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.

Pain processing is no longer seen as a repetitive relay of signals from body to brain, but as a complex system that can be up- and down-regulated by a number of different factors. One factor at the forefront of recent research is in the pain-potentiating synapse located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and the role of astrocytes in encapsulating these synapses. Garrison and co-workers were the first to suggest association when they found a correlation between astrocyte hypertrophy in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and hypersensitivity to pain after peripheral nerve injury, typically considered an indicator of glial activation after injury.|$|E

40|$|Adequate {{observation}} {{techniques are}} required to explore changes in the <b>nociceptive</b> system in <b>pain</b> patients. In this thesis neurophysiological observation methods of nociceptive system are explored. The focus is to explore the merits of electrocutaneous single pulse (SP) and pulse train (PT) stimulation as observation techniques of the nociceptive system. It is shown that in healthy subjects both SP and PT influence evoked potentials (EPs) and subjective ratings; however not all EP components were changed by both methods. For both SP and PT the amplitude of several EP components were inhibited by a heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulus. Results of lumbosacral radicular patients showed that similar EP components were modulated by SP and PT in both patients and healthy subjects. However EP amplitudes were larger or smaller in patients. In this thesis we showed that both SP and PT methods influence EP components and subjective ratings differently. The results {{shed some light on}} the link between neurophysiology of nociception and the recorded EPs. We concluded that different ways of processing are involved in both SP and PT method. PT is less dependent on stimulus location, which can be of interest for further research to changes in the <b>nociceptive</b> system of <b>pain</b> patients.

The present study examines the question of whether this association previously found in non-selected samples of chronic pain patients can also be found in chronic pain patients with underlying pathology of neuropathic sensory symptoms. Methods: Neuropathic sensory symptoms in  306  patients with chronic pain diagnosed as typical neuropathic pain, radiculopathy, fibromyalgia, or <b>nociceptive</b> back <b>pain</b> were assessed using the Pain DETECT Questionnaire. Two separate cluster analyses were performed to identify subgroups of patients with different levels of self-reported neuropathic sensory symptoms and, furthermore, to identify subgroups of patients with distinct patterns of neuropathic sensory symptoms (adjusted for individual response bias regarding specific symptoms). Results: ANOVA (analysis of variance) results in typical neuropathic pain, radiculopathy, and fibromyalgia showed no significant differences between the three levels of neuropathic sensory symptoms regarding pain intensity, pain chronicity, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, and depressive symptoms. However, in <b>nociceptive</b> back <b>pain</b> patients, significant differences were found for all variables except pain chronicity. When controlling for the response bias of patients in ratings of symptoms, none of the patterns of neuropathic sensory symptoms were associated with pain and psychological factors. Conclusion: Neuropathic sensory symptoms are not closely associated with higher levels of pain intensity and cognitive-emotional evaluations in chronic pain patients with underlying pathology of neuropathic sensory symptoms. The findings are discussed in term of ­differential response bias in patients with versus without verified neuropathic sensory symptoms by clinical examination, medical tests, or underlying pathology of disease.
