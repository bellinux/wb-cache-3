We aimed to study the electrophysiological and haemodynamic effects of simultaneous intracoronary endothelin- 1 and intravenous isoproterenol infusions. 18 anaesthetised open chest dogs were studied after AV-ablation. Mean arterial blood pressure, coronary blood flow, left ventricular contractility, standard electrocardiograms, right and left ventricular epi- and endocardial monophasic action potential (MAP) signals were recorded. Intracoronary endothelin- 1 (30 pmol/min) was given to Group ET (n= 6), intravenous isoproterenol (0. 2 microg/kg/min) to Group ISO (n= 6), both endothelin- 1 and isoproterenol to Group ET+ISO (n= 6) for 30 min. MAP duration increased in all studied regions of Group ET, decreased in all studied regions of Group ISO and ET+ISO (control vs. maximal changes of left ventricular epicardial MAP 90 % duration, Group ET: 296 +/- 22 vs 369 +/- 20 ms, p< 0. 05, Group ISO: 298 +/- 18 vs 230 +/- 27 ms, p< 0. 01, Group ET+ISO: 302 +/- 18 vs 231 +/- 10 ms, p< 0. 01).

40|$|Aims: Patients {{with heart}} failure are characterised by a {{disturbed}} sympathovagal balance, {{as could be}} shown by analyses of heart rate variability and baroreflexsensitivity. Furthermore, the modulation of ventilation is disturbed in those patients with an increased ventilation volume following the inhalation of hypoxic gas. This study should evaluate, whether heart failure patients have a decreased hyperoxic chemoreflexsensitivity {{associated with an increased}} rate of ventricular arrhythmias. Methods and results: Into this study, 49 consecutive patients were enrolled. Of these, 23 suffered from heart failure; the remaining had no evidence of heart failure and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction. All patients were investigated by analysing the reduction of heart rate following inhalation of pure oxygen. The difference of RR-interval divided by the difference of the venous oxygen partial pressure both before and after oxygen inhalation resulted in the chemoreflexsensitivity. ŽPatients with heart failure showed a significantly decreased chemoreflexsensitivity compared to those without 2. 621. 85 vs [...] 5. 806. 37 msmmHg, P 0. 05. Of patients with heart failure, 69. 6 % had a decreased chemoreflexsensitivity below 3 msmmHg, in contrast to only 38. 5 % of the control group. Patients with decreased chemoreflexsensitivity showed significantly Ž. more <b>non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardias</b> 46 vs. 4 %, P 0. 05 during Holter ECG.

A decreased chemoreflexsensitivity is associated with an increased rate of <b>non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardias.</b> This may be related to an increased sympathetic tone in these patients. The chemoreflexsensitivity may be important in arrhythmic risk stratification of patients with heart failure. 200...|$|R

5000|$|The {{incidence}} and clinical significance of cardiac arrhythmias during long-term exposure to microgravity experienced on the International Space Station (ISS) or during a prolonged (that is, up to 3 years) sojourn to Mars {{or on the}} Moon are {{a concern for the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). At present, there are only anecdotal reports of cardiac arrhythmias in space, including one documented episode of <b>non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia.</b> However, the potential catastrophic nature of a sudden cardiac death in the remote, but highly public, environment of space flight has led to continued concern {{since the early days of}} the space program over the possibility that space flight might be arrhythmogenic.

5000|$|At present, {{there is}} little {{evidence}} suggesting that cardiovascular adaptation to microgravity or space flight increases susceptibility to life-threatening arrhythmias in astronauts. From a clinical perspective, according to the “biological model” of sudden cardiac death, both the substrate and the trigger for arrhythmias should be considered to determine whether long-term space flight could lead to an increased risk of sudden death. In this model, structural abnormalities interact with functional alterations, such as exercise, electrolyte disturbances, or neurohumoral modulation, to create an environment in which arrhythmias can be initiated and/or sustained. In patients with coronary artery disease, the substrate is clear: a myocardial infarction (MI) and/or scar leading to focal areas of slowed conduction, a necessary condition for re-entry. For patients with apparently normal ventricular function, the potential substrate is less certain. In fact, reentry often is not the mechanism of arrhythmia development in these clinical cases: the arrhythmias may be caused by delayed after-depolarizations, and the triggered activity may be mediated via catecholamines. The published report of <b>non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> during prolonged space flight [...] supports this hypothesis, in that initiation of tachycardia by a late diastolic premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is more consistent with triggered activity than it is with re-entry.|$|E
40|$|Dobutamine-sttess {{echocardiography}} (DSE) {{is recognized}} as a reliable means of non-invasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), but some centers do not recommend DSE in patients with atrial fibrillation (AFIB) because of safety, unpredictable heart rate response and varying cycle lengths. Therefore we analyzed our experience with DSE in 77 pts with chronic AFIB. There were 48 men and 29 females, mean age: 72 ± 7 years. Associated valvular (21 %) and hypertensive (32 %) heart disease were frequent. Ejection fraction at rest was 50 ± 15 %. Medications included digoxin (70 %), calcium channel blockers (33 %) and β-blockers (16 %). Mean dobutamine dose was 28 ± 10 μg/kg/min. In 8 % of pts, atropine was given. Achievement of target heart rate was {{the main reason for}} termination of DSE (73 % of pts). The ECG was non-diagnostic in 78 %. In 39 % of pts, DSE was considered to be positive for ischemia. No major complications occurred. In 16 % of pts, <b>non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardias</b> (3 – 7 beats) occurred. HR at rest was 79 ± 16 bpm, at peak 139 ± 9 bpm.

Methods:  We generated heterozygotic (RyR 2 p/s) and homozygotic (RyR 2 s/s) transgenic mice and studied Ca 2 + signals from regularly stimulated, Fluo- 3 -loaded, cardiac myocytes. Results were compared with monophasic action potentials (MAPs) in Langendorff-perfused hearts under both regular and programmed electrical stimulation (PES). Results:  Evoked Ca 2 + transients from wild-type (WT), heterozygote (RyR 2 p/s) and homozygote (RyR 2 s/s) myocytes had indistinguishable peak amplitudes with RyR 2 s/s showing subsidiary events. Adding 100 nm isoproterenol produced both ectopic peaks and subsidiary events in WT but not RyR 2 p/s and ectopic peaks and reduced amplitudes of evoked peaks in RyR 2 s/s. Regularly stimulated WT, RyR 2 p/s and RyR 2 s/s hearts showed indistinguishable MAP durations and refractory periods. RyR 2 p/s hearts showed <b>non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardias</b> (nsVTs) only with PES.

Methods and Results Standard 12 -lead ECGs were monitored throughout As 2 O 3 therapy in 20 APL patients. As 2 O 3 (0. 15 mg/kg) significantly prolonged the corrected QT interval (QTc: 445 ± 7 to 517 ± 17 ms, means±SE, p< 0. 01), and also increased the QTc dispersion and transmural dispersion of repolarization. <b>Non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardias</b> and torsades de pointes occurred in 4 and 1 patients, respectively. The action potentials and isometric contraction were measured in guinea pig papillary muscles during As 2 O 3 perfusion (350 μmol/L). The action potential duration was prolonged (APD 90 : 150 ± 11 to 195 ± 12 ms at 60 min, p< 0. 01, n= 5) and perfusion of As 2 O 3 in a low K+ solution with a low stimulation rate augmented the prolongation of APD, and provoked early after-depolarizations and triggered activities. The prolonged exposure to As 2 O 3 induced muscle contracture, after-contractions, triggered activities and electromechanical alternans. Tetrodotoxin or butylated hydroxytoluene partially prevented the As 2 O 3 -induced prolongation of APD.

Holter recordings showed frequent isolated ventricular extrasystoles with the same morphology as that of initiating <b>ventricular</b> extrasystoles, and <b>non-sustained</b> polymorphic <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> with short cycle length (mean of 245 ± 28 ms) in all 16 patients. Radiofrequency catheter ablation by targeting the initiating ventricular extrasystoles eliminated episodes of syncope, VF, and cardiac arrest in all patients during follow-up periods of 54 ± 39 months. ConclusionsOur data suggest that the malignant entity of idiopathic VF and/or polymorphic <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> was occasionally present in patients with idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias arising from the RVOT. Radiofrequency catheter ablation was effective as a treatment option for this entity...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between cardiac autonomic tone, assessed by baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability, and left ventricular function, arrhythmias on Holter monitoring, and clinical variables in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  DESIGN—A prospective observational study.  PATIENTS— 160 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and preserved sinus rhythm {{in the absence of}} antiarrhythmic drug treatment. Measures of heart rate variability obtained by digital 24  hour Holter recordings included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats (RRm), the standard deviation of the mean of normal RR intervals (SDNN), and the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (rMSSD). Baroreflex sensitivity testing was performed using the phenylephrine method.  RESULTS—Mean SDNN (SEM) was 112  (46)  ms, and baroreflex sensitivity was 7. 5  (5. 0) ms/mm Hg. SDNN showed a weak correlation with baroreflex sensitivity (r =  0. 19, p <  0. 05) and with left ventricular ejection fraction (r =  0. 29, p <  0. 05). SDNN showed no significant correlation with age (r = − 0. 07), the presence of <b>non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> (r = − 0. 13), or left ventricular end diastolic diameter (r = − 0. 07). In addition, baroreflex sensitivity showed no significant correlation with age (r = − 0. 13), <b>non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> (r = − 0. 08), left ventricular end diastolic diameter (r =  0. 09), or ejection fraction (r =  0. 14).  CONCLUSIONS—The weak correlation between baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability suggests that these two indices explore different aspects of cardiac autonomic control in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The weak or absent correlation between baroreflex sensitivity, heart rate variability, and other potential non-invasive risk predictors, including left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end diastolic diameter, and <b>non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> on Holter monitoring, indicate that these variables may have independent prognostic value in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.    Keywords: cardiomyopathy; baroreflex sensitivity; heart rate variabilit...|$|E
40|$|SummaryWe {{describe}} {{a case of}} a 60 -year-old male with dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by Fabry disease. He was diagnosed to have a cardiac variant of Fabry disease by an enzyme assay and a right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy which revealed specific features of this disease and cardiac involvement was the sole manifestation. He has developed dilated cardiomyopathy with sustained atrial flutter and frequent <b>non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> requiring isthmus ablation and cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator...|$|E
40|$|We {{described}} {{a case of}} a 58 -year-old man with organic changes consistent with right ventricular cardiomyopathy. He also had a loss-of-function mutation in the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN 5 A, described in Brugada syndrome. He first presented with <b>non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> and was implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. He remained asymptomatic for 8 years until he developed recurrent episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, which required multiple shocks. The patient was treated with a combination of quinidine and verapamil and since then remained free of arrhythmias...|$|E
40|$|Chagas' myocardiopathy, {{caused by}} the {{intracellular}} protozoan Trypanosoma 						cruzi, is characterized by microvascular alterations, heart failure 					and arrhythmias. Ischemia and arrythmogenesis {{have been attributed to}} proteins 					shed by the parasite, although this has not been fully demonstrated. The aim of 					the present investigation was to study the effect of substances shed by 						T. cruzi on ischemia/reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. We 					performed a triple ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) protocol whereby the isolated 					beating rat hearts were perfused with either Vero-control or Vero T. 						cruzi-infected conditioned medium during the different stages of 					ischemia and subsequently reperfused with Tyrode's solution. ECG and heart rate 					were recorded during the entire experiment. We observed that triple I/R-induced 					bradycardia was associated with the generation of auricular-ventricular blockade 					during ischemia and <b>non-sustained</b> nodal and <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> during 					reperfusion. Interestingly, perfusion with Vero-infected medium produced a delay 					in the reperfusion-induced recovery of heart rate, increased the frequency of 					tachycardic events and induced ventricular fibrillation. These results suggest 					that the presence of parasite-shed substances in conditioned media enhances the 					arrhythmogenic effects that occur during the I/R protocol...|$|R
40|$|Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) {{are usually}} {{implanted}} {{in patients with}} malignant ventricular tachyarrhytmias. Aim {{of this study was}} to investigate the recurrence of minor ventricular arrhythmias to predict the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation episodes in patients with ICD. The study design was a retrospective analysis of 237 patients, whose ICD was programmed to deliver electrical therapy only for ventricular fibrillation (VF) but not for <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> (VT). We calculated the number, the mean duration and the mean ventricular cycle of the <b>non-sustained</b> <b>ventricular</b> tachyarrhythmias (NST) and of the sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ST). We found that VF patients had a significant higher incidence of <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> compared to the no-VF patients. In addition, the mean VT episodes duration was higher in patients of the VF group than in patients free from ventricular fibrillation and the ventricular cycle length resulted to be significantly shorter in VF patients. 1...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} assess the {{efficacy}} and safety of ibutilide cardioversion for those with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) receiving long-term treatmentwith class IC agents. BackgroundAttenuation of ibutilide-induced QT prolongation has been observed in {{a small number of}} patients pretreated with class IC agents. The clinical significance of the interaction between ibutilide and class IC agents is unknown. MethodsSeventy-one patients with AF (n = 48) or AFL (n = 23), receiving propafenone 300 to 900 mg/day (n = 46) or flecainide 100 to 300 mg/day (n = 25), presented for ibutilide (2. 0 mg) cardioversion. ResultsThe mean durations of arrhythmia episode and arrhythmia history were 25 ± 48 days and 4. 4 ± 6. 4 years, respectively. Sixty-five patients (91. 5 %) had normal left ventricular systolic function. Twenty-three of 48 patients (47. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval, 33. 3 % to 62. 8 %) with AF and 17 of 23 patients (73. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval, 51. 6 % to 89. 8 %) with AFL converted with mean conversion times of 25 ± 14 min and 20 ± 12 min, respectively. There was a small increase in corrected QT interval after ibutilide (from 442 ± 61 ms to 462 ± 59 ms, p = 0. 006). One patient developed <b>non-sustained</b> polymorphous <b>ventricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> and responded to intravenous magnesium. Another developed sustained torsade de pointes and was treated effectively with direct-current shock and intravenous dopamine. ConclusionsOur observations suggest that the use of ibutilide in patients receiving class IC agents is as successful in restoring sinus rhythm and has a similar incidence of adverse effects as the use of ibutilide alone...|$|R
