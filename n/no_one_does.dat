25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he must know that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> any wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who do no wrong, not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.|$|E
25|$|Eating {{times are}} variable. Foraging trips can occur {{at any time}} and are very coordinated: either the entire colony forages or <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>does.</b> A small {{proportion}} of starved individuals is enough to reach agreement and start group movement. However, this organized behavior and the high fidelity of caterpillars to pheromone hormone trails imply conservative foraging, which may trap caterpillars to poor food sources even if a better one is close by. Some plasticity in this behavior has been reported, which is modulated by the presence of caterpillars that are behaviorally more exploratory or that simply become more adventurous because they are starved, increasing foraging flexibility. With age, competition for food becomes more important, especially as resources become scarce. Grouping decreases growth rate via a decrease in food intake so ontogenetic changes toward more mobility and independence can be viewed as simple “scaling” relationships between caterpillars and food sources evolved to increase the benefits of individual foraging in later stages.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for the Washington Post, Desson Howe praised the Coens and [...] "their inspired, absurdist taste for weird, {{peculiar}} Americana– but {{a sort of}} neo-Americana that is entirely invented– the Coens have defined and mastered their own bizarre subgenre. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> it like them and, it almost goes without saying, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> it better." ...|$|E

He {{expressed}} his love for the episode, praising the centering of [...] "Parallels" [...] on Worf [...] "partly because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> frustrated befuddlement better than Michael Dorn". He enjoyed the increasing changes to each universe, but his highlight of the episode was the Enterprise from the Borg invasion timeline which fired on the shuttle at the end. DeCandido said that this kept the episode memorable after 19 years, and [...] "cemented this as one of TNG top episodes". In {{a list of the}} top 100 episodes of the Star Trek franchise, [...] "Parallels" [...] was placed in 89th place by Charlie Jane Anders at io9.|$|E

2500|$|Poundstone tours {{the country}} extensively, {{performing}} stand-up comedy in theaters {{and performing arts}} centers. She is known for never doing the same act twice and spontaneously interacting with the crowd. Writes Nick Zaino III of the Boston Globe, [...] "Her crowd work has always been unusual—her natural disposition, curious and ever-perplexed, allows Poundstone to aggressively question audience members without ever seeming threatening. And <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> the callback better."

2500|$|The {{reintroduction}} of Vicki {{was part}} of the producers' plan to reform the Watts family, including the resurrection of Vicki's father Den, who had been presumed dead for 14 years. Discussing working with Leslie Grantham, who played Vicki's [...] "iconic" [...] father Den, Johnson said, [...] "I was 2 when he left EastEnders [...] so I never witnessed the hype surrounding him. I'm very aware of the legend. How could I not be? My only concern was that he should take me seriously [...] It's been fabulous. I can't wait for our scenes to be shown. They're really edgy and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> edgy better than Leslie. It's been a massive challenge but I think the results are incredibly hard-hitting. EastEnders is becoming more like a serial drama than a soap. It's so well-written." ...|$|E
2500|$|The role of cantankerous skipper Charlie Allnutt won Bogart {{his only}} Academy Award in three nominations, for Best Actor in a Leading Role in 1951. Bogart {{considered}} his performance {{to be the}} best of his film career. [...] He had vowed to friends that if he won, his speech would break the convention of thanking everyone in sight. He advised Claire Trevor, when she had been nominated for Key Largo, to [...] "just say you did it all yourself and don't thank anyone". But when Bogart won the Academy Award, which he truly coveted despite his well-advertised disdain for Hollywood, he said [...] "It's {{a long way from the}} Belgian Congo to the stage of this theatre. It's nicer to be here. Thank you very much... <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> it alone. As in tennis, you need a good opponent or partner to bring out the best in you. John and Katie helped me to be where I am now". Despite the thrilling win and the recognition, Bogart later commented, [...] "The way to survive an Oscar is never to try to win another one... too many stars... win it and then figure they have to top themselves... they become afraid to take chances. The result: A lot of dull performances in dull pictures".|$|E
2500|$|Moses, like a {{carnival}} barker, sells {{tickets to the}} trials. He serves as prosecutor, Fatty as defense attorney, Begbick as judge. First comes the case of Toby Higgins, accused of premeditated murder {{for the purpose of}} testing an old revolver. Fatty invites the injured party to rise, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>does</b> so, since the dead do not speak. Toby bribes all three, and as a result, Begbick dismisses the case. Next Jimmy's case is called. Chained, he is led in by Billy, from whom he tries to borrow money; Billy of course refuses, despite Jim's plea to remember their time together in Alaska. In virtually the same speech he used to attack Higgins, Moses excoriates him for not paying his bills, for seducing Jenny (who presents herself as a plaintiff) to commit a [...] "carnal act" [...] with him for money, and for inciting the crowd with [...] "an illegal joyous song" [...] {{on the night of the}} typhoon. Billy, with the chorus's support, counters that, in committing the latter act, Jimmy discovered the laws by which Mahagonny lives. Moses argues that Jim hastened his friend Joe's death in a prizefight by betting on him, and Billy counters by asking who actually killed Joe. Moses does not reply. But there is no answer for the main count against him. Jim gets short sentences for his lesser crimes, but for having no money, he is sentenced to death. Begbick, Fatty and Moses, rising to identify themselves as the injured parties, proclaim [...] "in the whole human race / there is no greater criminal / than a man without money". As Jim is led off to await execution, everyone sings the [...] "Benares Song", in which they long for that exotic city [...] "where the sun is shining." [...] But Benares has been destroyed by an earthquake. [...] "Where shall we go?" [...] they ask.|$|E
