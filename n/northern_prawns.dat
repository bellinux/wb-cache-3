40|$|Abstract only. The <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> Fishery {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} fisheries in Australia with a yearly estimated value of production of about $ 64 mil. Nine prawn species are commercially harvested from the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> Fishery with 80 % of annual average catch represented by the banana prawn (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis) and the tiger prawns (Penaeus esculentus and Penaeus semisulcatus). The biological complexity of this multi-species fishery affects the ability of management to predict stock levels and consequently to set economically sustainable harvest levels. The model developed here suggests optimal management strategies using a stage population matrix to estimate prawn abundance as a function of catch and effort registered in previous years.

40|$|Summary of {{priority}} issues {{for managing the}} ecological effects of fishing in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> Fishery The ecological risk assessment (ERA) process was designed to assess and rank the ecological effects of fishing in Commonwealth fisheries. The ERA process for the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> Fishery (NPF) analysed the effect of commercial fishing, based on the effects on all organisms (protected species, bycatch, byproduct and target species), habitats and ecological communities {{that occur in the}} area of the fishery. The process provided a list of species, habitats and ecological communities that are at risk of ecological damage from the effects of fishing. The ecological effects of fishing in the NPF are largely due to the incidental capture of non-target species (including the capture of protected species). The methods of fishing employed in the NPF were found to have little to no detrimental impact on the physical marine environment. The highest level of ERA assessment conducted on the NPF is a quantitative Level 2. 5 assessment. The initial ERA process was completed in 2009 and identified seven species at high risk to the effects of fishing in the NPF (Table 1) ...|$|R
