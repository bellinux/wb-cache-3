40|$|The {{transport}} {{activity of}} the glutamine/neutral amino acid transporter SNAT 3 (former SN 1, SLC 38 A 3), expressed in oocytes of the frog Xenopus laevis {{is associated with a}} <b>non-stoichiometrical</b> membrane conductance selective for Na+ and/or H+ (Schneider, H. P., S. Bröer, A. Bröer, and J. W. Deitmer. 2007. J. Biol. Chem. 282 : 3788 – 3798). When we expressed SNAT 3 in frog oocytes, the glutamine-induced membrane conductance was suppressed, when carbonic anhydrase isoform II (CAII) had been injected into the oocytes. Transport of substrate, however, was not affected by CAII. The reduction of the membrane conductance by CAII was dependent on the presence of CO 2 /HCO 3 −, and could be reversed by blocking the catalytic activity of CAII by ethoxyzolamide (10 μM). Coexpression of wild-type CAII or a N-terminal CAII mutant with SNAT 3 also reduced the SNAT 3 - associated membrane conductance. The catalytically inactive CAII mutant V 143 Y coexpressed in oocytes did not affect SNAT 3 -associated membrane conductance. Our results reveal a new type of interaction between CAII and a transporter-associated cation conductance, and support the hypothesis that the transport of substrate and the <b>non-stoichiometrical</b> ion conductance are independent of each other. This study also emphasizes the importance of carbonic anhydrase activity and the presence of CO 2 -bicarbonate buffers for membrane transport processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{excretion}} of ions by the glands on {{the upper}} surface of Limonium vulgare, Mill. (syn. Statice limonium) was studied {{by means of a}} short-circuit technique. The 'active' transport of sodium and chloride ions in an outward direction was demonstrated, the difference between these two ion transports being correlated with the short-circuit current. The inward transport of potassium ions was also demonstrated, together with the outward transport of rubidium, caesium, bromide and iodide ions. Evidence is produced that the alkali metal ion and halide ion transports are not independent, but are linked in a <b>non-stoichiometrical</b> manner. From measurements of the impedance of the leaf, the transglandular resistance has been calculated, and comparison with the ionic conductance of the glandular membranes shows that a serious discrepancy exists, as has been noted for many other biological tissues. The ion transport and the electrical properties are discussed in the light of modern theories and work on other materials. <p...|$|E
30|$|As seen in {{the above}} equations, TiCl 4 · 2 THF {{molecule}} dissociates and reacts with ethanol {{to form a new}} complex (1). This complex ion further reacts with alkali metal oxide (Li 2 O) to form TiO 2 (THF) 2 cluster which is an unstable oxide precursor (2). Through cluster condensation reaction, the small TiO 2 (THF) 2 clusters will grow up. The particle growth and precipitation do not occur unless the cluster size reaches to a critical point (3). It is clearly seen from Equation 2 that either the in situ increase of the Li 2 O concentration, for example by pouring addition, or the evaporation of ethanol can result in a rapid formation of the clusters (nucleus) and precipitation. However, the solvent evaporation also favors the formation of the final product as depicted in Equation 3. These are consistent with the facts that a <b>non-stoichiometrical</b> addition of TiCl 4 · 2 THF to Li 2 O solution results in a faster particle precipitation than the synchronous stoichiometrical mixing of the two solutions as shown in Figures 3 and 4.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRationaleCompound-specific stable carbon isotope {{analysis}} by gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) {{is widely used}} in studies of environmental or biological functioning. In the case of derivatized molecules, a calibration might be required due to added non-analyte carbon {{and in some cases}} non-stoichiometric recovery by the mass spectrometer. MethodsTwo biological materials of known isotopic composition were produced by microbial cell cultures on either C- 13 -labelled glucose or non-labelled glucose as sole source of carbon. Subsequent hydrolyzed amino acids were derivatized as tert-butyldimethylsilyl (tBDMSi) derivatives and analyzed by GC/C/IRMS. The C- 13 -enrichment measurements were used as a direct calibration to calculate the original C- 13 /C- 12 ratios of individual amino acids. We tested this calibration on both known and unknown samples. ResultsFor the main proteinogenic amino acids we could determine the number of non-analyte added carbon atoms and assess the <b>non-stoichiometrical</b> recovery of tBDMSi carbon atoms, due to their incomplete oxidation in the combustion step of GC/C/IRMS. The calibration enabled the determination of the natural abundances (C- 13 values) of amino acids with an average accuracy of 1. 1 parts per thousand. We illustrate the application of the calibration to determine the C- 13 /C- 12 ratios of amino acids, and the associated uncertainty, in biological and plant materials. ConclusionsThe analysis of a labelled microbial cell culture offers a straightforward, rapid and reliable estimate of non-analyte carbon contribution to stable isotope composition. We recommend this method as a calibration or a control in artificial or natural C- 13 -tracing experiments. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
