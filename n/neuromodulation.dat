25|$|<b>Neuromodulation</b> is a {{field of}} science, {{medicine}} and bioengineering that encompasses both implantable and non-implantable technologies (electrical and chemical) for treatment purposes.|$|E
25|$|Peripheral <b>neuromodulation</b> has {{tentative}} {{benefits in}} primary headaches including cluster headaches and chronic migraine. How it may work {{is still being}} looked into.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{involves}} a multidisciplinary approach involving medications, physical and occupational therapy, psychological treatments, and <b>neuromodulation.</b> Despite this, {{the results are}} often unsatisfactory, especially if treatment is delayed.|$|E
25|$|The TCAs show {{efficacy}} in {{the clinical}} treatment {{of a number of}} different types of chronic pain, notably neuralgia or neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. The precise mechanism of action in explanation of their analgesic efficacy is unclear, but it is thought that they indirectly modulate the opioid system in the brain downstream via serotonergic and noradrenergic <b>neuromodulation,</b> among other properties. They are also effective in migraine prophylaxis, though not in the instant relief of an acute migraine attack. They may also be effective to prevent chronic tension headaches.|$|E
25|$|However, the BOLD signal cannot {{separate}} {{feedback and}} feedforward active networks in a region; the slowness of the vascular response means the final signal is the summed {{version of the}} whole region's network; blood flow is not discontinuous as the processing proceeds. Also, both inhibitory and excitatory input to a neuron from other neurons sum {{and contribute to the}} BOLD signal. Within a neuron these two inputs might cancel out. The BOLD response can also be affected by a variety of factors, including disease, sedation, anxiety, medications that dilate blood vessels, and attention (<b>neuromodulation).</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{patients}} who cannot use a continuous positive airway pressure device, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014 granted pre-market approval for an upper airway stimulation system that senses respiration and delivers mild electrical stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve {{in order to}} increase muscle tone {{at the back of the}} tongue so it will not collapse over the airway. The device includes a handheld patient controller to allow it to be switched on before sleep and is powered by an implantable pulse generator, similar to one used for cardiac rhythm management. Approval for this active implantable <b>neuromodulation</b> device was preceded by a clinical trial whose results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Neuromodulation</b> {{exists in}} the {{olfactory}} system and is responsible for neural plasticity and behavioural change in both mammals and insects. In the context of olfactory memory, neuromodulators regulate storage of information {{in a way that}} maintains the significance of the olfactory experience. These systems are highly dependent on norepinephrine and acetylcholine, which affect both implicit and explicit memory. Studies involving the noradrenergic system of mice demonstrate elimination of habitual learning when areas involving this system are lesioned, and subsequent restoration of habitual learning abilities when noradrenaline is injected into the olfactory bulb. [...] The importance of cholinergic systems has been demonstrated in studies of rats and the effects of scopolamine, with acetylcholine being involved in initial learning stages and more specifically in the reduction of interference between stored memories.|$|E
2500|$|Sleep aids {{the process}} by which {{creativity}} forms associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. This occurs in REM sleep rather than in NREM sleep. Rather than being due to memory processes, this has been attributed to changes during REM sleep in cholinergic and noradrenergic <b>neuromodulation.</b> High levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus suppress feedback from hippocampus to the neocortex, while lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the uncontrolled spread of associational activity within neocortical areas. This is in contrast to waking consciousness, where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex. REM sleep through this process adds creativity by allowing [...] "neocortical structures to reorganise associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes." ...|$|E
