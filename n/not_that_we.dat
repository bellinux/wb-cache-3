500|$|In {{response}} to questions posed by The Guardian and handed to the band via their lawyer, Pussy Riot accused Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church of orchestrating the case. Samutsevich said in December 2012 that [...] "more than anything, what many people didn't see during the trial were those moments when our 'right to defence' was violated. It's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were helpless, it was a situation of despair." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she continued: [...] "The trial was built {{in such a way}} that we couldn't defend ourselves. They didn't listen to us. We could have sat downstairs, where you wait till you're taken to the courtroom, and not go in at all and everything would've gone the same way. The fact that we took part physically [...] didn't actually change anything." ...|$|E

Having worked with keyboardist and {{arranger}} Chris Caswell on Tron: Legacy, the duo enlisted him and connected with engineers and other session players for their next album. Daft Punk recalled that they wished to avoid the more compressed sounds of drum machines in favor of [...] "airy open" [...] drum sets of the 1970s and 80s, which the duo consider the most appealing era. Bangalter clarified that [...] "it's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can't make crazy futuristic sounding stuff, {{but we wanted to}} play with the past". The duo noted that the session players were enthusiastic to reunite {{in the context of the}} new album and the perceived prestige of the studio locations.|$|E
500|$|Dreyer {{had always}} {{stated that the}} band's second album would feature [...] "a lot of storytelling", [...] "a lot of groove", and [...] "a more of an organic feel" [...] than their debut album. When {{describing}} {{the sound of the}} album the band wrote that they believe it is [...] "musically more heavy and more soft, more fast and more slow, more complicated and more straight-forward, and I know my band mates would agree, so there isn't really a thing this record sounds like, at least <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can hear." [...] With writer Vladimir Nabokov's works Pale Fire and Lolita being considered as the [...] "biggest external influence" [...] on Wildlife, the album features dark lyrical themes that focus on personal loss and the anger and despair felt from watching one's hometown decay, as well as dealing with personal loss, whether it is faith, a friend, or a family member.|$|E

And trust Gulzar to artfully craft {{a really long}} fuse for the Kaminey bomb, making sure the tracks stay afire long before and after they actually go boom." [...] Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave a rating 4 out 5 and wrote, [...] "Kaminey is certainly not a run of the mill album {{and this is where}} its prime strength lies. The album boasts of at least three chartbuster tracks'Dhan Te Nan' (sure shot superhit), 'Thode Bheege' (must for the hearts in love) and 'Raat Ke Dhai Baje' (for some 'masti' and 'hungama'). Songs like 'Fatak' and 'Kaminey' are innovative and situational which showcase the range of Vishal Bhardwaj. Add to that the 'Go Charlie Go– Theme Music' and you know that Kaminey is yet another addition to some excellent albums that have hit the stands during last one month." [...] Planet Bollywood rated the album 8.5 out of 10 and said it is the best soundtrack released that year, and that [...] "t has experimentations with both music and lyrics". Indo-Asian News Service praised the soundtrack and said that [...] "..."Kaminey" [...] is easily among 2009's finest scores. Experimental in its sound, yet very mainstream in appeal.

2500|$|Richard Fass puts {{forward the}} {{possibility}} that business scandals {{in the real world}} make students believe dishonesty is an acceptable method for achieving success in contemporary society. [...] Academic dishonesty, in this case, would be practice for the real world. For some students, there would be a dichotomy between success and honesty, and their decision is that: [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> love honesty less, but that we love success more." [...] Conversely, other scholars consider that with the recent rise in corporate ethics related dismissals in the business world, this approach to cheating may be losing its appeal, if it ever really had any. However, {{it has been shown that}} the expected benefits of cheating as well as student's morality plays an important role for the engagement in dishonest behavior.|$|E

The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country".

In terms of writing music — <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> really write music per se, but say we did write music, we'd write it for strings and piano." [...] Adding, [...] "A lot of times when we get musicians into the studio we just get them to play along with preliminary ideas or themes. We can record hours of music and end up using one minute of it. But this time we had the body of the songs before the string quartet came, and we wrote down a part for them.

We also take turns to have meals so that we have around 15 to 20 minutes for mealtimes." [...] He said that he enjoyed a pay increase in 2011. Two Everbest employees said that, by working as a pair and managing their time during a 24-hour shift, they can alternate and work six or twelve hours. They said they took home HK$1,315 and HK$1,441, (between US$170 and $185) per shift, averaging HK$20,000 ($2,560) per month. They also said that some of their colleagues wanted to return to work, but were worried they would be chastised as spineless.|$|E
