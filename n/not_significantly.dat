5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with anxiolytic properties {{have been}} introduced, {{and there is}} increasing awareness of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, prescriptions for short-term anxiety relief have <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E
30|$|Analysis of {{variance}} showed that positive samples does <b>not</b> differ <b>significantly</b> among one site to another; P value =  0.7159 (one-way ANOVA, P >  0.05).

In earlier ten-day feeding trials on GNA-fed rats, Pusztai concluded that they did <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affect growth, despite some hypertrophy of the small intestine and a slight decrease of gut enzyme activity.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter. But he also noted that such estimates depend on many dubious assumptions.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} may {{be diagnosed}} when {{the combination of}} hyperglycemia (high blood sugars), ketones in the blood or on urinalysis and acidosis are demonstrated. In about 10% of cases the blood sugar is <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> elevated ("euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis").|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C virus {{genotyping}} {{was assessed}} for 257 chronic hepatitis C patients with viral loads above 1, 000 IU/ml. Twelve patients were coinfected {{with more than}} one genotype.

5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may be because they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may be {{as a result of an}} increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
5|$|The planet e's {{eccentricity}} {{is poorly}} defined; varying values between 0 and 0.4 does <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> improve the fit, so an eccentricity of 0.2 was assumed. Taking {{interactions between the}} planets into account results in a near-zero orbital eccentricity.|$|E
5|$|The {{prescribing}} information {{notes that}} hypertension, sometimes severe, {{was observed in}} some people taking bupropion, both with and without pre-existing hypertension. The frequency of this adverse effect was under 1% and <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> higher than found with placebo. A review of the available data carried out in 2008 indicated that bupropion is safe to use in people {{with a variety of}} serious cardiac conditions.|$|E

5|$|The {{revolution}} {{marked the}} end of the colonial administration of the Dutch East Indies, except for Netherlands New Guinea. It also significantly changed ethnic castes, as well as reducing the power of many of the local rulers (raja).

5|$|While it yet {{remains to}} be seen if there are principally more stable isotopes, there has not any theoretical, let alone practical, {{suggestion}} this could be the case. In a 2012 calculation by the JINR, it was suggested that the half-lives of all dubnium isotopes, synthesized or not, would <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> exceed a day.|$|E
5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced}} to Europe in the 14thcentury, it did <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affect castle building until the 15thcentury, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16thcentury, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was {{a renewed interest in}} castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.|$|E

5|$|Angus Maddison {{estimates}} that the country's gross domestic product was equivalent to $450 per head in 1990 United States dollars—a sum that was above subsistence level, and which did <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> change {{until the beginning of}} the Song dynasty in the late 10th century. Sinologist Joseph Needham has disputed this and claimed that China's GDP per capita exceeded Europe by substantial margins from the 5th century BCE onwards, holding that Han China was much wealthier than the contemporary Roman Empire. The widespread circulation of coin cash enriched many merchants, who invested their money in land and became wealthy landowners. The government's efforts to circulate cash had empowered the very social class which it actively tried to suppress through heavy taxes, fines, confiscations, and price regulation schemes.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins was {{considered}} an incremental installment for the series, rather than a transformative one. GameSpot said that Arkham City expanded on Arkham Asylum by applying the game mechanics to a larger open-world setting, but criticized Arkham Origins for replicating Arkham City without moving the series forward. Other critics agreed, saying that the game's well-received elements from the previous game were <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> developed or augmented and it was routine rather than inspired. However, other reviewers rated it {{on a par with}} Arkham City.|$|E
5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns {{began an}} {{artillery}} bombardment {{that was probably}} the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affect the Union position.|$|E

5|$|As the Telephone Building {{was being}} {{completed}} in 1925, {{a group of}} Methodist Episcopalians came to Pflueger, asking him to design a new skyscraper containing both a church and a hotel for them at 100 McAllister Street. After a dispute, Miller and Pflueger were fired from the project {{to be replaced by}} Lewis P. Hobart. Miller and Pflueger sued for $81,600, alleging that Hobart's design was <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> changed from Pflueger's original. Three months after the hotel and church opened in January 1930, Miller and Pflueger won $38,000 in court, equivalent to $ today.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E
5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> interacted with another galaxy of {{comparable}} mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
