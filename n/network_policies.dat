Beyond the technical and engineering aspects are economic questions, and the points of view of various stakeholders and participants on such <b>network</b> <b>policy</b> issues stem from differing economic philosophies. This paper postulates and describes four competing economic doctrines: conservative neoclassical, liberal neoclassical, neo-Keynesian, and innovation economics.

40|$|A 'Babylonian' {{variety of}} <b>policy</b> <b>network</b> {{concepts}} and applications {{can be found}} in the literature. Neither is there a common understanding of what <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> actually are, nor has it been agreed whether <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> constitute a mere metaphor, a method, an analytical tool or a proper theory. The aim of this article is to review the state of the art in the field of <b>policy</b> <b>networks.</b> Special attention is given to the German conception of <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> which is different from the one predominant in the Anglo-Saxon literature. While British and American scholars usually conceive <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> as a model of state/society relations in a given issue area, German works tend to treat <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> as an alternative form of governance to hierarchy and market. It is argued that this conception of <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> goes beyond serving as a mere analytical tool box for studying public policy-making. Yet, both the German and the Anglo-Saxon conception of <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> face a common challenge: first, it still remains to be systematically shown that <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> do not only exist but are really relevant to policy-making, and second, the problem of the ambiguity of <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> has to be tackled, as <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> can both enhance and reduce the efficiency and legitimacy of policy-making...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the early evolution of UK organic food and farming <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> and locates this empirical focus in a theoretical context concerned with understanding the contemporary policy-making process. While <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> {{have emerged as}} a widely acknowledged empirical manifestation of governance, debate continues as to the concept's explanatory utility and usefulness in situations of <b>network</b> and <b>policy</b> transformation since, historically, <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> have been applied to ‘static’ circumstances. Recognizing this criticism, and in drawing on an interpretivist perspective, this paper sees <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> as enacted by individual actors whose beliefs and actions construct {{the nature of the}} network. It seeks to make links between the characteristics of the <b>policy</b> <b>network</b> and the <b>policy</b> outcomes through the identification of discursively constructed ‘storylines’ that form a tool for consensus building in networks. This study analyses the functioning of the organic <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> through the discursive actions of policy-network actors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Merlin network management framework. With Merlin, administrators express <b>network</b> <b>policy</b> using programs in a declarative language based on logical predicates and regular expressions. The Merlin compiler automatically partitions these programs into components {{that can be}} placed {{on a variety of}} devices including switches, middleboxes, and end hosts. It uses a constraint solver and parameterizable heuristics to allocate resources such as paths and bandwidth. To ease the administration of federated networks, Merlin provides mechanisms for delegating management of sub-policies to tenants, along with tools for verifying that delegated sub-policies do not violate global constraints. Overall, Merlin simplifies the task of network administration by providing high-level abstractions for directly specifying <b>network</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Internet, and {{consequently}} its backbone networks, do {{not rely on}} central control or coordinating facilities, nor do they implement any global <b>network</b> <b>policies.</b> The resilience of the Internet results from its principal architectural features, most notably the idea of placing as few network state and control functions {{as possible in the}} network elements, and instead relying on the endpoints of communication to handle most of the processing to ensure data integrity, reliability, and authentication. In addition, the high degree of redundancy of today's network links and sophisticated real-time routing protocols provide alternate paths of communications for load balancing and congestion avoidance.|$|E

50|$|Application Defined Network (ADN) is an {{enterprise}} data network that uses virtual network and security components {{to provide a}} dedicated logical network for each application, with customized security and <b>network</b> <b>policies</b> {{to meet the requirements}} of that specific application. ADN technology allows for a simple physical architecture with fewer devices, less device configuration and integration, reduced network administration and a lower tax on IT resources. ADN solutions simplify businesses’ need to securely deploy multiple applications across the enterprise footprint and partner networks, regardless of where the application resides. ADN platforms provide policy-based, application-specific delivery to corporate data centers, cloud services and/or third-party networks securely and cost effectively. Some ADN solutions integrate 3G/4G wireless backup services to enable a second internet connection automatically and instantly when connectivity is lost on the primary access connection. The ADN design provides an application-to-application (A2A) based model that evolves enterprise networks beyond the traditional site-to-site (S2S) private model.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contrasts}} the equine <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> and organisational {{landscapes of}} the horse industry in England, Sweden and the Netherlands. In order to analyse each network the conceptual framework offered by the Marsh-Rhodes <b>policy</b> <b>network</b> typology is adopted, while the dimensions of membership, integration, resources and power are specifically considered. The origins and development of each <b>policy</b> <b>network</b> studied are analysed, along with an appraisal of their inherent characteristics. The cultivation and maintenance of consistency, communication and collaboration within a diverse <b>policy</b> <b>network</b> are examined. In addition, {{the influence of a}} diverse <b>policy</b> <b>network</b> on <b>policy</b> decision making is explored. The importance of relationships between key individuals within <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> is analysed, along with the significance of the micro and macro levels of the networks. Finally, the future development of the equine <b>policy</b> <b>network</b> and horse industry in England for the benefit of interest groups and the government is considered. Within each <b>policy</b> <b>network</b> a specific organisation which acted as the mouthpiece for interest groups within the network to the government was identified. However, the structure of each of these bodies and their mode of operation differed considerably between countries. In Sweden and the Netherlands, the connection between the equine and agricultural <b>policy</b> <b>networks</b> was shown to be significant {{in the development of the}} relationship between interest groups within the horse industry and the government. In both countries an organisation from the agricultural sector expedited the development of this relationship. The level of government intervention and financial support afforded to each horse industry varied.
