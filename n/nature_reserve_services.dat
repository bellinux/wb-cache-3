40|$|<b>Nature</b> <b>reserves</b> {{are widely}} {{considered}} as one available strategy for protecting biodiversity, which is threatened by habitat fragmentation, and wildlife extinction. The Chinese government has established a goal of protecting 15 % of its land area by 2015. We quantitated the characteristics and distribution of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> in mainland China and evaluated the expansion process for national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves.</b> National <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> occupy 64. 15 % of the total area of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves.</b> Steppe and meadow ecosystem, ocean and seacoast ecosystem, and wild plant <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> represent lower percentages, particularly in national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> in which they comprised 0. 76 %, 0. 54 %, and 0. 69 %, respectively, of the area. Furthermore, medium and small <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> compose 92. 32 % of all <b>nature</b> <b>reserves.</b> The land area under any legal protection has reached 14. 80 %, although only 9. 78 % is strictly protected. However, if 9 super-large national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> located in Southwest and Northwest China were removed, the percentage of strictly protected area decreases to 2. 66 % of the land area of China. The areas contained in <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> in each province are not proportional to {{the areas of the}} provinces, particularly for national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves,</b> with higher protection rates in Southwest and Northwest China than in other regions. Of the 31 provinces, 22 provinces feature strict protection of less than 4 % of their areas by national nature reserves; these provinces are mainly located in East, Central, South, and North China. Moreover, the unevenness indexes of the distribution of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> and national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> are 0. 39 and 0. 58, respectively. The construction of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> has entered a steady development stage after a period of rapid expansion in mainland China. In recent years, the total area of national <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> has increased slowly, while the total area of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> has not increased, although the number of <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> continues increase...|$|R

40|$|Society in the 21 st Century is seen {{to value}} and {{appreciate}} the natural environment in numerous ways. Local <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> provide various <b>services</b> and {{play a key role}} in moderating the conflicts arising between increasing urbanisation and the need for environmental conservation. These natural havens, their supporters often argue, promote community engagement and community spirit and are beneficial to human health and well being. The aim of this research was to gain an understanding of the public’s perception and views of Local <b>Nature</b> <b>Reserves</b> (LNRs). It has also assessed the level of knowledge and engagement held by the public in Plymouth. Although constrained to some degree by sample size and sample composition the data collected through questionnaires and interviews reinforced the widely held view that LNRs were becoming a most important aspect of the Plymouth community. These questionnaires were administered to randomly selected members of the public in the city centre of Plymouth and on and around local <b>nature</b> <b>reserves.</b> The sample sites were chosen to ensure a diversity of engagement with local <b>nature</b> <b>reserves</b> against which comparisons can be made to analyse possible correlations and patterns with other variables. More targeted interviews were later conducted with individuals who have a professional connection or voluntary connection with LNRs in order to assess expert opinion and knowledge. The research found that the general public were reacting positively to the recent additions of reserves to Plymouth and to the current management processes. It was found, however, that the majority of those in the data sample knew little about who manages the reserves and what is being achieved currently. This allowed the opportunity to test whether this is true of those who use the reserves compared to those who did not. Those who had knowledge of the conservation and management efforts of the Plymouth City Council and volunteer groups were found to be engaging more with the reserves and were participating with events and volunteering days more frequently. The results show that the users of the reserves believed that the reserves promote community cohesion, community spirit and aid in health and well being of society...|$|R
