5|$|The {{electrons}} in an atom {{are attracted to}} the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the {{electrons in}}side an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are areas}} of relatively low {{pressure in the}} troposphere, with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface. On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level. The environment <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes, thus they are characterized as “warm core” systems.|$|E
5|$|Winds within {{high-pressure}} areas flow {{outward from}} the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers. Gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the area into greater density – and so greater weight compared to lower pressure, lower density, and lower weight of the air outside the center.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} {{large and}} rich region for detecting interstellar molecules is Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2). This giant molecular cloud lies <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the Milky Way galaxy {{and is a}} frequent target for new searches. About half of the molecules listed below were first found near Sgr B2, and nearly every other molecule has since been detected in this feature. A rich source of investigation for circumstellar molecules is the relatively nearby star CW Leonis (IRC +10216), where about 50 compounds have been identified.|$|E

5|$|As {{distance}} between {{the mouth of the}} St. Johns and the middle and upper basins increases, the salinity in the river gradually decreases. Marine water measures at 35parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as brackish water. <b>Near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Jacksonville, average measures have been collected at 11.40ppt. Farther south at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9ppt and falls again to 0.81ppt at the Shands Bridge near Green Cove Springs.|$|E
5|$|Early on July8, another brief {{burst in}} {{convection}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Blanca occurred. In this area, satellites found sustained winds around 40mph (65km/h). However, the convection quickly dissipated and the winds {{were not considered}} to be representative of the storm's true intensity. By later that day, convection had not reformed around the center of circulation and Blanca degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system, corresponding with the final public advisory from the NHC. Although no longer a tropical cyclone, the remnants of Blanca maintained a well-defined low pressure center as it continued its northwesterly movement. Early on July11, the system turned northward and gradually weakened. The following day, the remnants of Blanca dissipated over open waters.|$|E

Now in Niagara Falls, Niagara County, NY324 ends at a complex interchange featuring NY384, the Niagara Scenic Parkway, and the LaSalle Expressway on the eastern bank of the river. Farther north, I-190 meets U.S. Route62 (US62) at exit22 and NY182 at exit23.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the higher education programs, Unicamp is also responsible for running and funding two technical high schools, the Technical High School of Campinas (COTUCA) and the Technical High School of Limeira (COTIL). Cotuca was located for 50 years in a historical building <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the city built in 1918 which also housed Unicamp {{for a brief period}} before the current campus was built. In 2014 it was transferred to the main campus as the old building went through renovations. Both schools are amongst the best public high schools in the country, and are highly competitive, with admissions done through a selection exam open to middle-school students.|$|E
5|$|<b>Near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> {{the county}} {{in the town of}} Sodus, NY104 serves as the {{northern}} terminus of NY88 northwest of the village of Sodus. While NY88 heads east into the village, NY104 bypasses Sodus to the north. East of the village, Ridge Road and NY104 intersect as Ridge Road flips to the north side of NY104. The two highways follow parallel routings southeast toward Alton, where NY104 intersects NY14. East of Alton, the gap between the two widens as Ridge Road veers north to access Sodus Bay. NY104, meanwhile, follows a nearly linear routing into the town of Huron, where it intersects the northern terminus of NY414.|$|E
5|$|The National Mall is a large, open park in {{downtown}} Washington between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol.

5|$|The Warren Family Mortuary Chapel is a stone chapel {{built on}} a knoll <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the cemetery. It was {{designed}} by Henry Dudley of New York City and built in 1860 in the English country Gothic style, complete with a nave and transept floor plan. A tower was added in 1883, with great care placed on finding building material that matched the earlier structure. The Chapel contains stained glass windows above the altar designed by artist Robert Walter Weir. Former member of the United States House of Representatives Joseph Mabbett Warren (1813–1896) is interred in the chapel.|$|E

5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of {{thunderstorm}} development. Mature thunderstorms are found <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. Multicell storms form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These type of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.|$|E
