He {{introduces}} himself to Bruce as Ducard, an associate of Ra's, and trains Bruce in martial arts. Later he reveals himself to Bruce, {{as well as his}} intentions to destroy Gotham. Writer David Goyer said he felt he was the most complex of all the Batman villains, comparing him to Osama bin Laden; [...] "He's <b>not</b> <b>crazy</b> in the way that all the other Batman villains are. He's not bent on revenge; he's actually trying to heal the world. He's just doing it by very draconian means." [...] Gary Oldman was first choice for the part, but ended up playing James Gordon instead. Guy Pearce, who collaborated with Christopher Nolan on Memento (2000), reported that the pair had discussions about him playing the role, but both of them decided that he was too young for the part. Neeson is commonly cast as a mentor, so the revelation that his character was the main villain was intended to shock viewers.|$|E

Schwartz praised the car chase, the handling of the relationship between Simmons and Fitz in regards to his keeping Aida a secret from her, and the use of James, taking advantage of the audience's familiarity of him from the previous season.|$|E
500|$|Wenger {{has been}} {{credited}} with promoting the importance of diet and nutrition in football and advocating the principle that the sport ought to be entertaining on the pitch. The signings of Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit, Marc Overmars and Nicolas Anelka, combined with the club's many experienced players, helped Arsenal win the double in 1997–98. Wenger led Arsenal to another double in 2001–02; his team scored in every Premier League game that season and won their remaining 13 matches to clinch the title. A year later, Wenger became the first manager since Keith Burkinshaw 21 years previously to retain the FA Cup; Arsenal beat Southampton 1–0 in the final. Wenger won his third league title in 2003–04, which earnt distinction as he guided his team to an unbeaten league season, something achieved only once before in English football, by Preston North End in 1888–89. Another FA Cup was won in 2005, this time on penalties against Manchester United. Wenger took Arsenal to their first UEFA Champions League final in 2006 {{and in the same}} year oversaw the club's relocation to the Emirates Stadium. In October 2009, Wenger surpassed Allinson to become Arsenal's longest serving manager and reflected the club were [...] "maybe <b>not</b> <b>crazy,</b> but brave" [...] to appoint him.|$|E
500|$|Webb felt a {{responsibility}} to reinvent Spider-Man. One departure from the preceding trilogy was to have Spider-Man build artificial web-shooters, as the character does in the comics. In February 2011, with {{the launch of the}} official website, the title and first official image of Garfield as Spider-Man depicting both his costume and web-shooters for the first time were revealed. Writer Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times was skeptical of the change, feeling that it was too hard to believe that a financially strapped young man could conceive a wrist-worn device that can instantly produce a strand of synthetic webbing and [...] noted [...] "the suit lives up to the challenge of being different from the Sam Raimi films but not too different from the classic suit that stands {{as one of the great}} comic-book costumes ever." [...] Matt Goldberg of Collider admitted that he was <b>not</b> <b>crazy</b> about the costume, explaining that the bug-yellow eyes felt weird to him and the mesh-pattern felt too busy. He explained that the design of the gloves caused flashbacks to the Spider-Man 2099 costume which he did not like, although he felt that the web-shooters looked fine. Webb explained that he felt that [...] "the web-shooters were able to dramatize Peter's intellect". Webb paid attention to the question of [...] "How would a kid make it?" [...] and then took some license with it. About the new costume, Webb explained that he and the crew [...] "wanted a design that would make the body longer and more lithe, more of an acrobat, someone incredibly agile and the legs of the spider [...] were something we used to emphasize that." [...] He revealed that the film used varying suits for different lighting conditions. They made the webbing on the costume a little darker. Webb stated that [...] "With the costume and the web-shooters we wanted to emphasize that these are things that Peter Parker made". Webb also looked at the Mark Bagley art in Ultimate Spider-Man for the hero's body.|$|E

West was criticized by various celebrities for the outburst, and by President Barack Obama, who called West a [...] "jackass". In addition, West's VMA disruption sparked a large influx of Internet photo memes with blogs, forums and [...] "tweets" [...] with the [...] "Let you finish" [...] photo-jokes. He posted a Tweet soon after the event where he stated, [...] "Everybody wanna booooo me but I'm a fan of real pop culture... I'm <b>not</b> <b>crazy</b> y'all, I'm just real." [...] He then posted two apologies for the outburst on his personal blog; one {{on the night of the}} incident, and the other the following day, when he also apologized during an appearance on The Jay Leno Show. After Swift appeared on The View two days after the outburst, partly to discuss the matter, West called her to apologize personally. Swift said she accepted his apology. In September 2010, West wrote a series of apologetic tweets addressed to Swift including [...] "Beyonce didn't need that. MTV didn't need that and Taylor and her family friends and fans definitely didn't want or need that" [...] and concluding with [...] "I'm sorry Taylor." [...] He also revealed he had written a song for Swift and if she did not accept the song, he would perform it himself. However, on November 8, 2010, in an interview with a Minnesota radio station, he seemed to recant his past apologies by attempting to describe the act at the 2009 awards show as [...] "selfless" [...] and downgrade the perception of disrespect it created.|$|E
