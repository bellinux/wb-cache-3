50|$|As {{is typical}} with the Pinnidae, the shell is {{elongated}} and wedge-shaped, {{coming to a}} point at the anterior end. There are fifteen or more ridges running lengthwise, and spines arise from these towards the posterior edge. The exterior of the shell is an olive brown. The interior is nacreous to about half its length, {{and there is a}} conspicuous scar {{in the center of the}} shell at the border of this area, where the posterior adductor is attached. The mantle of the animal is orange and does not fill the shell entirely. The similar A. seminuda has the adductor scar entirely within the <b>nacreous</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
50|$|Upperside dark umber brown. Forewing with a large, white-centred, fulvous-ringed black median ocellus and a white-centred preapical {{much smaller}} black spot. Hindwing uniform, a post-median series of {{from two to}} four white-centred fulvous-ringed black ocelli, sub-equal and smaller than the {{posterior}} ocellus on the forewing. Underside: ground colour similar, but irrorated (sprinkled) with obscure transverse striae of a deeper brown; the terminal margins of both forewings and hindwings very broadly paler; the dark basal portion of the wings sharply defined by a very dark brown line; a postmedian series on both wings of rather small white-centred fulvous-ringed black ocelliâ€”two on the forewing, a median and a preapical; seven, placed in a slight curve, on the hindwing. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark umber brown, paler beneath. Male sex-mark of form 2, the patch of specialized scales on both forewing and hindwing very small; the <b>nacreous</b> <b>area</b> surrounding the specialized scales {{on the underside of}} the forewing very pale brown.|$|E
