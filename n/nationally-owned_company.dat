50|$|In 1945, the company, {{which by}} then {{employed}} 1400 people, {{was occupied by}} the Americans and Heinrich Röhm was evacuated to Heidenheim an der Brenz with his family. The new rulers in East Germany occupied the intact factory {{and turned it into}} a <b>nationally-owned</b> <b>company.</b> In 1946, the family moved to Sontheim/Brenz, where Heinrich Röhm decided at the age of 63 to reconstruct his company with the support of his sons. Without capital and without a plot of land the company was set up again from scratch. First of all, children's toys were made from plywood and wood waste in a leased carpentry. With the production of rock drills a change was made again to the business of metal machining. The same year, land was purchased and a barrack was constructed in order to reconstruct the RÖHM factory. The production, which started the following year, once more involved key-type drill chucks. Former clients supported the reconstruction by showing trust, placing orders and demanding the resumption of the past product range.|$|E
