50|$|While <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> {{are like}} banks, a key distinction, with {{important}} implications for financial stability, is that <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> do not have explicit deposit insurance provided by the government. Most traditional <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> are sponsored by commercial banks that provide explicit liquidity support.|$|R
50|$|<b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> first {{appeared}} in the mid-1980s. Initially, ABCP conduits were primarily sponsored by major commercial banks as a means of providing trade receivable financing to their corporate customers. Over the past decade, <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> have grown to serve a wide variety of needs such as: asset-based financing for companies that cannot access the commercial paper market, warehousing assets prior to security issuance, investing in rated securities for arbitrage profit, providing leverage to mutual funds, and off-balance sheet funding of bank assets.|$|R
50|$|Asset-backed {{commercial}} paper <b>program</b> (<b>ABCP</b> <b>program,</b> <b>ABCP</b> Conduit or Conduit) {{is set up}} as a program that issues short-term liabilities, {{commercial paper}}s called asset-backed commercial papers (ABCPs), to finance medium- to long-term assets. In terms of terminology, ABCP usually refers to asset-backed commercial paper, while ABCP conduit (or conduit) the program. The maturities of ABCP range up to 270 days but average about 30 days. Like banks, <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> provide liquidity and maturity transformation services. Because of this structure, ABCP conduits {{are considered to be}} part of the Shadow banking system. A common and prominent feature of many <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> is that they were created by banks to fund bank assets in an off-balance sheet way, possibly to avoid regulatory capital requirements. Due to this character, ABCP is blamed to be one of the reasons of the 2008 - 09 global financial crises.|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{the credit}} crisis 2007 - 08, this paper {{presents}} a theory of "capital market banks"; banks that use derivative programs to exploit ine¢ ciencies in the capital markets. I model banks’ use of asset backed commercial paper (<b>ABCP)</b> <b>programs</b> as a local game, and analyse how these programs a¤ect …nancial stability. In a …nancial market where banks are subject to costly capital requirements and investors are heterogeneous, the <b>ABCP</b> <b>program</b> arises endogenously in response to ine¢ cient risk sharing. The sustainability of the <b>ABCP</b> <b>program</b> depends crucially on the sponsoring bank’s capital. Small shocks to the bank’s capital {{can lead to a}} failure of the <b>ABCP</b> <b>program.</b> This ampli…es the shock and pushes the the bank into bankruptcy. I link the dynamics of the ABCP market to the interbank market, and argue that an unravelling of the ABCP market can cause a seizure of the interbank market. The model indicates, that traditional monetary policy is unable to alleviate seizures of the interbank market, but that targeted liquidity measures, such as the "Term Securities Lending Facility", the "Term Auction Facility", the "Troubled Asset Relief Program", the "Money Market ABCP Program" and the launch of a "super fund", could end the unravelling of the ABCP market and ease the pressures in the interbank market...|$|R
50|$|However, asset {{holdings}} of ABCP conduits, like at banks, are not transparent. While {{the vast majority}} of <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> have credit ratings from the major rating agencies, credit support mechanisms vary and the specific assets held in the programs are not widely known. For example, some <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> viewed their holdings to be 'proprietary' investment strategies and deliberately did not disclose. Thus, random events or concerns about an economic downturn can create uncertainty about asset values. This uncertainty is greater when less information is available about the assets.|$|R
50|$|In general, any {{asset class}} {{that has been}} funded in the term market has been funded in a conduit, {{and there are a}} wide variety of assets that are unique to the conduit market, however, at the time of 2007, the major asset of most <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> is asset-backed {{security}} backed by residential mortgages.|$|R
40|$|The $ 350 billion {{contraction}} in the asset-backed {{commercial paper}} (ABCP) {{market in the}} last five months of 2007 {{played a central role in}} transforming concerns about the credit quality of mortgage-related assets into a global financial crisis. This paper attempts to better understand why the substantial contraction in ABCP occurred by measuring and analyzing runs on <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> over the period from August 2007 through December 2007. While it has been suggested that commercial paper programs, like commercial banks, may be prone to runs, we are the first to conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of runs in the ABCP market using a rich and novel issue-level data set for all <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> in the U. S. market. A program is defined as being run when it does not issue new paper during a week despite having a substantial share of its outstandings scheduled to mature, and then continuing in a run until it issues. We find evidence of extensive runs: more than 100 programs (one-third of all <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs)</b> were in a run within weeks of the onset of the turmoil and the odds of subsequently leaving the run state were very low. We interpret this finding as an indication that the ABCP market was subject to a bank-like "panic. " We also find that while runs were linked to credit and liquidity exposures of individual programs, runs were also related importantly to non-program specific variables in the first several weeks of the turmoil, indicating that runs were relatively indiscriminate during the early part of the panic. Thus the ABCP market may be inherently unstable and a source of systemic risk. Financial crises; Commercial paper...|$|R
50|$|The most {{traditional}} <b>ABCP</b> <b>program</b> is a multi-seller program, {{in which a}} conduit purchases receivables and loans from multiple firms. The sponsor is typically a financial institution that provides the conduit with a committed liquidity line, administers its daily operations, and sometimes also provides the conduit with credit enhancement through a letter of credit that absorbs credit losses. At the end of July 2007, just before the widespread turmoil, there were 98 multi-seller programs in the U.S. ABCP market with outstanding of $525 billion, about 45 percent of total ABCP outstanding.|$|R
50|$|Above {{all these}} service types, <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> are {{commonly}} used by banks to free up their regulatory capitals by moving the seemingly safe assets off their balance sheet. Traditionally, banks keep everything on their balance sheet and owners of the bank have to hold {{a certain amount of}} equity to meet the capital requirement. This means if a bank wants to invest in a large new project, i.e. increase its asset largely, it has to increase owners' equity proportionality. Moving such project off bank's balance sheet eliminates the need of increasing equity. Through setting up ABCP conduits, banks can fund assets all by short-term liabilities.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sponsors}} of the conduit play two roles: manage assets and provide liquidity. Sponsor types range from large U.S. commercial banks to non-bank institutions, like mortgage lenders and asset managers. Large U.S. banks have long sponsored <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs,</b> some smaller U.S. banks sponsor a very modest share. Foreign banks sponsor a substantial share of ABCP, about 40 percent in 2007. Non-bank institutions, such as mortgage lenders, finance companies, or asset managers, also sponsor a considerable share of the market. Programs sponsored by non-bank institutions grew more dramatically than other programs from 2004 to 2007, more than doubling in assets to $400 billion.The ten largest sponsors as of January 2007 are: ...|$|R
50|$|As of September 2001, {{there were}} {{approximately}} 280 active <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs,</b> {{with more than}} $650 billion in outstanding. During the mid-2000s, ABCP saw a steady rise in popularity because of their high ratings {{from the perspective of}} investors and the low borrowing rates from companies who need money. Gradually, even more conservative investors, such as money market mutual funds and retirement funds began purchasing ABCP. This optimism pushed the outstanding of ABCP to $1.3 trillion by the time of July 2007. At that time, ABCP was the largest money market instrument in the United States, following by Treasury Bills with about $940 billion outstanding. However, this trend came to an abrupt end in August 2007.|$|R
5000|$|As in banks, the {{maturity}} of assets in ABCP conduits generally {{is longer than}} {{the maturity}} of the liabilities. More than half of ABCP daily issuance has maturities of 1 to 4 days, referred to as [...] "overnight", and the average maturity of outstanding paper is about 30 days. <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> regularly roll over their liabilities and use proceeds from new issuances to pay off maturing commercial paper. Loan and lease receivables, which are assets commonly purchased by ABCP conduits, likely have terms of 30 days or more, and while relatively short, are still longer than most ABCP. Most of the conduit assets are medium- to long-term assets with maturities of three to five years.|$|R
50|$|As the {{mortgage}} {{situation in the}} United States became more serious, market became unwilling to purchase ABCP. This caused trouble for financial institutions that had relied on sales of ABCP to obtain funds for use in longer-term investments (see Maturity mismatch). For example, as one form of the <b>ABCP</b> <b>program,</b> the structured investment vehicles (SIVs) set up by some commercial banks financed their longer-term, higher-yield investing through sales of ABCP. This had been very profitable when ABCP was considered safe (so that ABCP buyers accepted a low interest rate). When some asset prices dropped, investors were less willing to buy or rollover ABCP. This forced SIVs to quickly liquidate their longer-term investments at a substantial loss. The losses together with the panic in liquidity market formed a liquidity shock to the banking sector, which helped the contagion of the crisis.|$|R
50|$|During 2007, as {{negative}} information about U.S. residential mortgages spreads out, securities backed with mortgages, including sub-prime mortgages, widely held by <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs</b> of financial firms globally, started {{to lose their}} value. ABCP investors started {{to worry about the}} value of the asset backing their ABCP and stopped rolling over their position. At the beginning, sponsor banks have enough liquid to pay off these liabilities, but lack of market confidence can create a subprime mortgage crisis. On August 2007, the French bank BNP Paribas halted withdrawals from three funds invested in ABCP and suspended calculation of net asset values. Even though defaults on mortgages had been rising throughout 2007, the suspension of withdrawals by BNP Paribas has a profound effect on ABCP market. The interest rate spread of over-night ABCP and Federal funds rate increased from 10 basis points to 150 basis points within one day of announcement.|$|R
40|$|Questions {{have been}} raised {{regarding}} the role of low-tax offshore jurisdictions in the global financial crisis, based largely on evidence that many problematic asset-backed securities were issued from or listed in the Cayman Islands, Jersey, Ireland, and other ‘offshore’ sites. However, {{there has not been}} a systematic investigation of the offshore geography of crisis-implicated securitization. Here we fill this gap by constructing the first comprehensive jurisdictional map of the largest pre-crisis Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (<b>ABCP)</b> <b>programs,</b> and examining the rationale for and impacts of this geography in detail. We show that offshore jurisdictions were disproportionately involved in producing the most unstable ABCP classes. However, this is difficult to explain in terms of the traditional role of offshore banking centers as sites for direct avoidance of onshore regulation and transparency. Rather, we propose a Minskian model of pre-crisis offshore ABCP production, wherein these jurisdictions specialized in alleviating incidental institutional frictions (e. g. double taxation) hindering onshore financial innovation. In this context, they could sometimes be legitimately described as improving the institutional ‘efficiency’ of financial markets; however, by facilitating the endogenous evolutionary instability of these markets, this apparently innocuous service had profoundly negative effects. This normative disconnect poses a conundrum for offshore reform...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the start}} of the {{financial}} crisis, various forms of securitization have been criticized for causing the problems experienced. The amount of Asset Backed Commercial Paper outstanding fell drastically in the middle of 2007 drawing our attention to this market. Our study focuses on the use of receivables securitization by non-financial firms, and we investigate who uses these programs, why they do so, and whether it adds any economic value. We carefully collect data from the 10 -K filings of 242 users of securitization across the fiscal years 2006 and 2007, and combining it with accounting information from COMPUSTAT form powerful comparisons between users and non-users of receivables securitization We find that securitization appears to be most commonly utilized by those who are larger in size, have enough receivables to support a program, and who are restricted from accessing traditional credit markets due to high credit risk [...] We find that the use of receivables securitization does add economic value through its ability, as a form of secured financing, to help firms overcome the agency problems caused by ‘debt overhang’. It indicates that although financial firms were hurt by their use of <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs,</b> securitization can be useful to particular types of firms...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we measure}} and analyze {{runs in the}} asset-backed {{commercial}} paper (ABCP) market during the financial turmoil that erupted in 2007. While {{it has been suggested}} that commercial paper markets may be prone to runs, we are the first to conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of runs in the ABCP market. We contribute to the general understanding of runs using a rich issue-level data set of ABCP transactions for all programs in the US market, where we define a run as no issuance at a commercial paper program with a substantial amount of maturing paper. In addition to identifying runs on <b>ABCP</b> <b>programs,</b> we follow the literature on bank runs and attempt to disentangle runs driven by panics from runs driven by deteriorating fundamentals. Our analysis uses a rich cross section of data to link runs to a number of fundamentals, including program and sponsor types, ratings, and contract characteristics. We attribute increases in the likelihood of runs across all programs, after controlling for fundamentals, to panic. Our analysis yields substantial evidence of runs in the ABCP market in 2007. Moreover, our results suggest that the nature of runs evolves rapidly through a crisis, with widespread runs taking place during the first weeks of the turmoil, but with runs later on centered on fundamentally impaired programs...|$|R
50|$|SIVs fund {{highly rated}} securities. But unlike the credit {{arbitrage}} programs, SIVs {{do not have}} explicit agreements with their sponsoring banks for committed back-stop liquidity lines covering all their short-term liabilities. Instead SIVs relied on dynamic liquidity management strategies, which involved liquidating assets to pay investors if needed. At their peak in July 2007, there were 35 SIVs that accounted for $84 billion of U.S. ABCP. Some ABCP is issued by collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), sometimes called SIV-lites. CDOs are similar to SIVs in structure, but are not actively managed and tend to rely on explicit but only partial liquidity support. There were 36 <b>ABCP</b> CDO <b>programs</b> in July 2007, with ABCP outstanding of $47 billion.|$|R
