50|$|Stated income loans fill a gap of {{situations}} which normal loan standards would not approve. For example, a standard {{rule is that}} a customer's mortgage and other loan payments should take up no more than 45% of the person's income. This would seem prudent for a person just owning their main home. However, a real estate investor may have multiple properties and for each may receive {{only a small amount}} more than their loan payments on each house, but end up with $200,000 in disposable income. Nevertheless, a <b>non-stated</b> income loan would decline this person since their debt to income ratio would not be in line. The same issue can arise with self-employed borrowers, where the bank with a fully documented loan would include the borrower's business debt in their debt to income calculation. Stated income loans also help borrowers where fully documented loans normally would not consider the source of income as being reliable and stable, such as investors who consistently earn capital gains. Fully documented loans also do not consider potential future income increases. Another type of loan that uses the same principles is the no income disclosure loan.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the legal authority of <b>non-state</b> rules in international commercial contracts and their application in state courts. <b>Non-state</b> rules {{can be divided}} in uncodified rules and codified rules. Uncodified <b>non-state</b> rules are general principles of law, practices, trade usages, and custom. They have a customary origin. Codified <b>non-state</b> rules are model laws, restatements of law, standard terms and conditions, and guidelines. They are created by international organisations and trade associations. <b>Non-state</b> rules have legal authority in the national and the international sphere. Their legal authority can be established by looking at different factors: promulgator, substance, support, and application. It is especially the last factor which plays a deciding role in measuring their legal authority. This thesis uses three main case studies: France, England, and the US to understand the legal authority of <b>non-state</b> rules. After having established what <b>non-state</b> rules are and how their legal authority can be measured this thesis concentrates on their application in courts. It asks three important questions: when can <b>non-state</b> rules be applied? When are they applied? And how are they applied? There are four scenarios in which <b>non-state</b> rules are applied in descending degrees of legal authority: first of all, they are applied as the applicable law to the contract, secondly they are applied as sources of domestic law, thirdly {{they are used to}} interpret the applicable law, and fourthly they are applied as contractual rules. Legislations have a preference for uncodified <b>non-state</b> rules such as trade usages and general principles. These are often sources of domestic law. To apply these uncodified <b>non-state</b> rules judiciary resorts to codified <b>non-state</b> rules to go from the general principle to the practical application. After studying the application of <b>non-state</b> rules in depth, this thesis concludes with a framework and classification that leads to understanding the legal authority of <b>non-state</b> rules...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{research}} {{presented here}} attempts {{to identify and}} analyse the reported selection criteria used in the appointment of Australian vice-chancellors (VCs) and to contrast this with the selection criteria actually used. Design/methodology/approach - Contemporary research into the nature, role and purpose of section criteria in appointment processes has chiefly been conducted {{in the private sector}} and across various hierarchical levels. The research is based on a PhD entitled "The recruitment and selection of vice-chancellors for Australian universities". The research for the thesis had ethics approval and involved interviews with former and incumbent chancellors, VCs, consultants, representatives of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and selection panel members. Central to this research was the selection criteria and the skill bases selection criteria attempted to measure. A questionnaire was also sent to those listed above. Findings - The findings show that a matching of organisational antecedents with candidate attributes does occur. The research also highlights the key selection criteria used to appoint VCs. It also demonstrates how these key criteria are universally applied but in different orders depending upon the various foci of universities. <b>Non-stated,</b> but important, criteria and competencies are also discussed. Originality/value - No other research exists outlining the skill sets and competencies required by Australian VCs. It is hoped that this research will form the basis for further research and discovery into this field that we know so little about. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, reconciliation and the building of a unified nation have become key challenges for the new Rwandan political elite. To this end, over almost two decades, the government has introduced a variety of supposedly ‘traditional,’ ‘local’ and ‘participatory’ activities ranging from the well-studied gacaca courts (‘justice on the grass’) (see e. g., Clark 2010, Ingelaere 2009, Rettig 2008, Oomen 2006) to very little known activities such as ingando camps, itorero schools, ubudehe ‘mutual assistance’ schemes, ubusabane ‘get-together’ festivals, abakangurambaga or local ‘promoters,’ among many others. The present paper could have focused on a number of the recently-introduced ‘unity and reconciliation’ activities since all but gacaca have received almost no scholarly attention. Ingando camps, however, should interest us for many reasons, many of which will become apparent throughout the analysis below. Just as with the other activities, ingando offers insights into the performative aspect of nation-building—the ways in which a nation/unity is being ‘enacted,’ what type(s) of ‘unities’ are thus actually being built in Rwanda and how they are being built (official versions versus those that arise from enaction), and what other (<b>non-stated)</b> objectives might be served in the name of ‘nation-building. ’ But unlike other activities, the camps provide a unique insight into the way in which spatial and symbolic aspects, especially ‘liminality’ (a camp as a transient and transitional space), are being used to reproduce power (a structural set of relations) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{participation}} of <b>non-state</b> actors in multilateral institutions is often portrayed as {{one way of}} decreasing the perceived legitimacy deficit in global governance. The literature on <b>non-state</b> actors has identified several ways in which these actors can enhance the legitimacy of intergovernmental organisations and global governance arrangements. Three partially competing normative arguments, or rationales, {{for the inclusion of}} <b>non-state</b> actors in international policymaking ï¿œ functionalism, neocorporatism and democratic pluralism ï¿œ have been identified. Whereas functionalism highlights the contribution of <b>non-state</b> actors to output legitimacy in terms of expertise, neocorporatism emphasises the inclusion of affected interests, and democratic pluralism claims that <b>non-state</b> actors increase input legitimacy through procedural values. These three normative arguments thus offer different understandings of the motives for the inclusion and representation of <b>non-state</b> actors in international negotiations and diplomacy. Through a single case study of United Nations climate diplomacy, we analyse {{the extent to which the}} three rationales for <b>non-state</b> actor inclusion are found in views held by state and <b>non-state</b> actors participating in the annual United Nations climate change conferences. Our results show that different actor groups place varying degrees of emphasis on the different rationales for <b>non-state</b> actor inclusion, even though the neocorporatist rationale remains most favoured overall. We discuss the implications of our findings for the democratic legitimacy of increasing {{participation of}} <b>non-state</b> actors in intergovernmental affairs and recent trends in the participation of <b>non-state</b> actors in the international climate change policymaking process.

40|$|Globalization {{processes}} have rendered <b>non-state</b> actors {{an integral}} part of global governance. The body of literature that has examined <b>non-state</b> actor involvement in global governance has focused mainly on whether and how non-state actors can influence states. Less {{attention has been paid to}} the comparative advantages of <b>non-state</b> actors to answer questions about agency across categories of <b>non-state</b> actors, and more precisely what governance activities <b>non-state</b> actors are perceived to fulfil. Using unique survey material from two climate change conferences, we propose that different categories of <b>non-state</b> actors have distinct governance profiles. We further suggest that the different governance profiles are derived from particular power sources and that agency is a function of these profiles. The study thereby contributes to a strand in the literature focusing on the authority of <b>non-state</b> actors in climate governance and broadens the methodological toolkit for studying the “governors” of global governance.

However, I also have something constructive: a proposed trajectory. Talk about the state and the <b>non‑state</b> can only be an intermediary stage in a trajectory of a theory of governance that might lead to a new paradigm of governance. This trajectory would move from state centralism via a state/non‑state dichotomy and a state/non‑state hybridity toward a new paradigm of governance beyond the state. In other words, talk about <b>non‑state</b> governance is not too radical; it is not radical enough...|$|R

40|$|The {{desire to}} defend a state against attacks by a <b>non-state</b> actor {{requires}} thinking about counter-attacking without violating the sovereign equality of the territorial state because targeting a <b>non-state</b> actor on the territory of that state may violate its sovereignty. This paper evaluates the main views on self-defense by states against <b>non-state</b> actors by studying the Just War Theory and argues that self-defense against a <b>non-state</b> actor is allowed if the counter-attack complies with the principle of sovereign equality. Sovereign equality is the prohibition of states from dominion over other states because states are equal to one another. This principle can be respected by allowing self-defense against <b>non-state</b> actors to occur only if the state consented {{to the use of}} force on its territory or if that state is incapable of controlling or unwilling to control the <b>non-state</b> actor...|$|R

40|$|How does {{regime change}} affect <b>non-state</b> conflicts? Within the broader {{literature}} coup d états, riots and armed conflict {{is linked to}} transition between political regimes. For <b>non-state</b> conflicts {{there is a lack}} of systemic inquire about this topic. To investigate this topic I start by examining how states internal conditions put the contexts where violence becomes more or less likely. I argue that states with non-representative institutions and low state capacity put forth conditions where <b>non-state</b> conflicts are likely to erupt. Further, I investigate how regime change alters this institutional set up. The interplay of a state occupied reorganizing and the potential of a different future provide motivation and opportunity for actors dissatisfied with their current situation. If groups fail to display their importance and leverage in the transition period, stakes might be lost when the emerging regime enters office and politics start to consolidate. Using data on <b>non-state</b> conflicts from 1989 - 2008, I apply a negative binomial regression to test the effect of institutional set up and regime change on <b>non-state</b> conflicts. My analyses suggest a relationship between weak state capacity and <b>non-state</b> conflicts. Depending on choice of indicators, and the sample exposed, representative institutions might be an explanation of <b>non-state</b> conflicts. While I fail to find a general relationship between <b>non-state</b> conflicts and regime change, I find a strong relationship when allowing the indicator of regime change to include cases of state collapse.

40|$|Examples {{of state}} and <b>non-state</b> actors collaborating on issues of global {{politics}} abound. <b>Non-state</b> actors are increasingly involved in policy formulation processes, in peace-keeping processes, in human rights and environmental issues by advising governments or inter-governmental organisations. This type of collaboration mostly {{takes place at the}} discretion of states. However, <b>non-state</b> actors sometimes appear to initiate diplomatic processes. The Kimberley Process is an example of such a case. States and another <b>non-state</b> actor, namely business, were forced to the negotiating table by NGOs who were effectively raising consumer awareness about the role of diamonds in fuelling conflict and who held the power over launching a possible consumer boycott. Polylateralism is a term that was coined to represent the participation of <b>non-state</b> actors in the conduct of international relations. The study uses the Kimberley Process negotiations from 2000 to 2002 as a case study to analyse the dynamics of polylateral diplomacy by examining the nature and form of interaction between the three sets of actors, namely states, civil society and business {{in order to understand the}} role played by each group in both agenda setting and rule making, and the extent to which their interactions conform to the central ideas of polylateralism as advanced by international scholars. In so doing the study examines the evolving mode of interaction between states and <b>non-state</b> actors in the Kimberley Process, the ability of <b>non-state</b> actors to influence diplomatic processes, the extent to which states determined the boundaries of <b>non-state</b> diplomatic involvement and, finally, the limitations of polylateral diplomacy. The study concludes that the apparent increase in collaboration between state and <b>non-state</b> actors in diplomatic processes does not constitute a new method of diplomacy and that this will not change until <b>non-state</b> actors have become recognised polities. It also finds that the involvement of <b>non-state</b> actors in diplomacy, particularly as consumers of diplomatic outcomes is likely to become more-and-more prevalent and that professional diplomats, especially those in developing countries, may have to adapt their working methods in order to benefit from this phenomenon by allowing for a more systematic engagement with <b>non-state</b> actors. Finally, it finds that while the Kimberley Process is a good example of the involvement of <b>non-state</b> actors as producers of diplomatic outcomes, this phenomenon is less likely to reoccur and may well be the exception rather than the rule for the foreseeable future.

It seeks to identify and explore differences in attitudes toward change and professional inspiration between state and <b>non-state</b> secondary school teachers. The background for this study is framed by the post-communist transformation of the Czech political system, economy, and society. The combined influences of the pre-communist and communist heritage in teaching, the rapid post- 1989 transformation of Czech schooling, and the emerging differing characteristics and conditions of teaching in state as opposed to <b>non-state</b> schools pull teachers in state and <b>non-state</b> schools in different directions. This project studies teachers in eight schools, four state and four <b>non-state,</b> including three private and one church school, in two administrative regions of East Bohemia.

The ICC came into existence as a permanent criminal court for the prosecution of Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, War Crimes and Crime of Aggression.

40|$|A state's {{foreign policy}} is {{directed}} toward a variety of external actors. Most understanding of foreign policy behavior, however, is derived from observations of states interacting with other states. This study examines how foreign policy decision-making during crisis differs when it is directed toward violent <b>non-state</b> actors. A crisis is defined as an event in which a state perceives a threat {{to one or more}} of its basic values, along with an awareness of finite time for response, and a heightened probability of engaging in military hostilities. Violent <b>non-state</b> actors are those <b>non-state</b> groups that pursue their political goals through the use of or threat to use violence. Additionally, the <b>non-state</b> actors of interest are those that threaten an external state's national interests {{in such a way that}} it represents a crisis for that country, necessitating some form of foreign policy response. This study argues that because <b>non-state</b> actors lack many of the structural characteristics associated with a state, such as a recognized foreign ministry or the lack of trust states have in a <b>non-state</b> leader's ability to enforce agreements, states respond to these crises more violently than they do when responding to crises triggered by states. International Crisis Behavior (ICB) data confirms that the major response by states toward crises triggered by violent <b>non-state</b> actors are more violent than responses to crises triggered by states. Empirical results also show that <b>non-state</b> groups with more pronounced political and military structures are less likely to be responded to violently. Other factors, such as the nature of the value threatened and type of violence used to trigger the crisis, do not have a significant impact on how states respond. This study argues that a set of international norms have emerged that help mitigate the level of violence between states and that these norms do not apply as strongly to these violent <b>non-state</b> groups. However, <b>non-state</b> groups that are able to establish institutional structures similar to those of states are more likely to lessen the level of violence directed toward them...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues for}} the {{relevance}} of studying <b>non-state</b> actors in the state-formation process of the post-Ottoman Middle East. In writing a transnational political history, {{it is necessary to}} approach transnationalism in its political sense.

In re-reading the post-war settlement in the Middle East, the role of <b>non-state</b> actors involved and engaged in state-(re) formation becomes obvious and calls for further theoretical scrutiny. First, I will briefly discuss transnational history as an emerging research field and the place of transnational political history within this trend. I will then introduce the <b>non-state</b> actor concept as an analytical category in historical cases of political transnationalism. Finally, I will discuss the necessity of developing a new type of <b>non-state</b> actor engaged in new interactions aimed at state-(re) formation. This chapter I argue for {{the relevance of}} studying <b>non-state</b> actors in the state-formation process of the post-Ottoman Middle East. In writing a transnational political history, it is necessary to approach transnationalism in its political sense. In political science, political transnationalism refers to the interactions of <b>non-state</b> actors in world politics. In re-reading the post-war settlement in the Middle East, the role of <b>non-state</b> actors involved and engaged in state-(re) formation becomes obvious and calls for further theoretical scrutiny. First, I will briefly discuss transnational history as an emerging research field and the place of transnational political history within this trend. I will then introduce the <b>non-state</b> actor concept as an analytical category in historical cases of political transnationalism. Finally, I will discuss the necessity of developing a new type of <b>non-state</b> actor engaged in new interactions aimed at state-(re) formation, which would deliver broader and comparative explanation of the repeating causal and correlational patterns and dynamics of revolutionary figures and movements without simplifying the prevailing affinities, complexities, and varieties of Middle Eastern politics...|$|R

Primarily, through the use of global media, and to a greater extent the internet, <b>non-state</b> actors have been able to increase their soft power and put pressure on governments that can ultimately affect policy outcomes. Instead of front organizations, <b>non-state</b> actors can create cyber advocacy organizations [...] to recruit members and project their voice on the global stage.|$|R

However, at the international level, states have not agreed to prohibitions in international law on cross-border attacks by <b>non-state</b> entities. This paper explores how transnational paramilitary attacks by <b>non-state</b> entities might be criminalised and prosecuted under international and national law...|$|R

In this article, the author traces the movement away from this traditional State-centered view of international environmental protection. He discusses {{the history of the}} <b>non-state</b> party in numerous {{international and}} domestic forums, including the International Court of Justice, and examines the recent changes which have increased the power of nonstate interests. Although an absolute right does not exist for <b>non-state</b> actors to initiate environmental claims within an international forum, several states have acknowledged the importance of including <b>non-state</b> parties in the legislative as well as adjudicative stages of international environmental protection...|$|R
