Statistical work has focused on the identification of trends and shifts in profit rates not caused by cyclical fluctuations, and various theoretical explanations have been offered for the generally low rates of return that appeared in the 1970 s. These include capital deepening stimulated by a reduction in the cost of capital funds; profit squeezes caused by some combination of slower productivity growth, real wage push, and raw material price inflation; declining capital productivity; and changes i...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the process of finacialisation in South Africa. Financialisation is defined after Krippner (2005) and Arrighi (1994), as a pattern of {{accumulation}} in which profits accrue through financial markets and channels rather than through trade or commodity production in the real economy. We examine the financialisation of the South African economy from 1990 to 2012 —both before and after major financial market liberalizations. Five key features of the period emerge; first, a precipitous increase {{in the size of the}} <b>net</b> acquisition of <b>financial</b> assets (and the <b>net</b> incurrence of <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities)</b> on the balance sheets of all agents. Second the centrality of credit and foreign money capital in the financialisation process. Third a measureable relationship between levels of Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) market capitalisation and levels of portfolio capital inflows. Fourth, credit effects that overwhelm portfolio shift effects to a far greater extent than in the euro-zone area. Fifth, and last an unusually high degree of financial intermediation (when compared with the Euro zone area) that may be explained by the high degree of concentration in South Africa’s Monetary and Financial Institutions Sector (MFI’s).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine possible indicators that affect local unit credit risk and investigate their effect on default (credit risk) of local government units in Croatia. No system for the estimation of local unit credit risk has been established in Croatia so far causing many practical problems in local unit borrowing. Because of the specific nature of the operations of local government units and legislation that does not allow local government units to go into bankruptcy, conventional methods for estimating credit risk are not applicable, and the set of standard potential determinants of credit risk has to be expanded with new indicators. Thus in the paper, in addition to the usual determinants of credit risk, the hypothesis of the influence of political factors on local unit credit risk in Croatia is also tested out, with the use of a Tobit model. Results of econometric analysis show that credit risk of local government units in Croatia is affected by the political structure of local government, the proportion of income tax and surtax in operating revenue, the ratio of net operating balance, <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities</b> and direct debt to operating revenue, as well as the ratio of debt repayment and cash, and direct debt and operating revenue...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{inflation}} adjustments of corporate earnings on market prices were tested by cross section regressions of 485 manufacturing companies {{for the period}} 1966 - 76 and subperiods. The basic data were company reports and stock prices. For the full period, market prices reflected the inventory valuation adjustment and the decline in real value of <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities</b> fairly completely, but they reflected the adjustment for the understatement of depreciation to only a small extent. The surprisingly low effect of the depreciation adjustment could only be partly attributed to measurement error, but not entirely. The estimated effect of capital gains on stock prices was either {{in the wrong direction}} or negligible. The implication of the results is that market investors use a range of adjustments for the effects of inflation which differs from the estimates used in this study, though how and why they differ is not clear. The adjustments were much lower in the later period 1972 - 76 than in the earlier period 1966 - 71. This seemed inconsistent with the higher inflation rates in the later period. The explanation for the difference is not clear, but it may reflect the difficulties of judging the size of the adjustments in a period of rapid inflation. ...|$|E

40|$|Executive summary: While Commonwealth {{government}} debt {{has been the}} focus of attention recently, this report takes a broader view by bringing state debt into the picture. Much has been made of the fact that Commonwealth {{government debt}} is projected (under current expenditure and tax policies) to grow from $ 300 billion at June 2013 to more than $ 400 billion in 2016 – 17 — and keep growing. Over the same four years, net debt (after deducting certain financial assets) is expected to grow from $ 153 billion to $ 280 billion and then to $ 325 billion in 2018 – 19, at which point it will peak as a percentage of GDP. State debt has also risen dramatically since 2007, when net debt was negative. In the six years to 2013, states added $ 70 billion to their general government net debt to reach a positive level of $ 43 billion. Aggregate state debt is manageable at that level, but the upward trend is of concern—and more so in some states than others. By 2016 – 17, combined Commonwealth and state general government (GG) net debt will exceed $ 350 billion—almost 20 % of GDP, or more meaningfully, more than 50 % of general government revenue. The general government debt figures do not tell the full story. For the broader non-financial public sector (which includes non-financial public corporations), state net debt was much higher at $ 127 billion in 2013. Combined with the Commonwealth, total non-financial public sector net debt was $ 283 billion, already 50 % of the sector’s revenue. Public corporations’ debt is guaranteed by their government owners, but these corporations are better able to carry debt as their investments are supposed to be commercially viable. The above figures exclude non-debt financial liabilities such as unfunded superannuation and long-service leave liabilities. These loom large in state finances. When added to net debt, non-debt financial liabilities bring the 2013 total of <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities</b> to $ 190 billion for state general government and $ 319 billion for the state non-financial public sector. In most states, general government <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities</b> in 2013 exceeded 100 % of revenue, having increased steeply since 2007. The states’ financial position has deteriorated because their net operating surpluses have shrunk while capital (‘infrastructure’) spending soared, resulting in large cash deficits. All states have experienced this deterioration: Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania have lost the coveted triple-A credit rating, and NSW and Victoria are at risk of being downgraded should current trends continue. All states have curbed the growth of operating expenditure, but they will need to persevere in the face of sluggish revenue if they are to rebuild operating surpluses and avoid sharp cuts in capital expenditure...|$|E
40|$|The Australian {{economy has}} been one of the top {{performers}} among OECD countries since the mid- 1990 s. This economic boom has brought the country's public finance into fiscal surplus since 1998, and general government <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities</b> approached almost zero in mid- 2000. As with monetary policy, fiscal policy has been formulated and implemented under a medium-term framework based on rules. It is the Charter of Budget Honesty Act (1998) that regulates this framework. The country's sound public finances result not only from the introduction of these rules, but also to a large extent from public expenditure management reforms that have continued since the mid- 1980 s. These reforms, which satisfy both top-down overall expenditure controls and bottom-up micro-level resource allocation and expenditure efficiencies, have extensively altered the conventional budget process. The driving force behind these reforms and the building of more solid public finances originated in concern over external imbalances such as growing current account deficits. It has not been easy to maintain fiscal discipline in the conditions of fiscal surplus that have prevailed since 2000. Faced with an aging population, Australia needs to provide public services such as health care and education more efficiently and effectively while securing the sustainability of public finances. This will require further improvements in public expenditure management, especially in the accrual-based budgeting system introduced at the end of the 1990 s, and more comprehensive assessment of outcomes and outputs in public services. ...|$|E

However, from the alternative ‘golden rule ’ policy standpoint, fiscal balance is not a 1 meaningful fiscal policy measure⎯although its stock counterpart, <b>net</b> <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities,</b> is. 1. The Move to Accrual Accounting Over recent years, Australian Governments have progressively implemented accrual accounting in their general government (ie budget) sectors 1, replacing the traditional 'cash' accounting system which is still used by most governments around the world. This process culminated with the presentation of the annual government budget on a full accrual basis, a step which took place at the Commonwealth government level and in most of the States in 1999 - 2000. The adoption of accrual accounting in the Australian public sector has been complicated by the simultaneous use by governments of two significantly different accrual accounting frameworks. The dominant framework is that derived from Australian Accounting Standard (AAS) 31. The other is the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) framework developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics ' (ABS). The GFS accrual framework is a reformulation in accrual concepts of a statistical series which prior to 2000 was principally based upon cash accounting concepts. GFS generally follows the international economic-analysis accountin...|$|E
