The gate was enlarged by the British, and became known as Porte des Bombes. It was eventually detached from the faussebraye to facilitate the flow of traffic, and it <b>now</b> <b>looks</b> like a triumphal arch.|$|E

25|$|Talakad is a {{historical}} site {{along the banks of}} the Cauvery River near Mysore. This small town, with a strong history and a prolonged period of human settlement was a flourishing city during the Hoysala period (12th–13th century), and was also an important trade centre during the reign of Gangas (from the 6th century for about 400 years) and Cholas (close of 10th century) and the Hoysalas from 1116. Towards the early 15th century it came under the Vijayanagara rule, and remained with them until the end of the 16th century. There are about a dozen temples spread over a small area of , perhaps reflecting the rich art, culture, trade and human activities that once existed there. The town <b>now</b> <b>looks</b> abandoned, except during the time of pilgrimage held once every few years. The temples, whose deities are regularly worshipped, such as the Kirthinarayana Temple, are either uncovered frequently or are protected continuously from accumulation of sand. The sand is removed to uncover them for a specific worship and an important pilgrimage held every five to twelve years; the recent Panchalinga Darshana pilgrimage was held during December 2006.|$|E

500|$|Notable in the {{development}} of Super Mario Kart was its use of Mode 7 graphics. First seen in F-Zero, Mode 7 is a form of texture mapping available on the SNES which allows a plane to be rotated and scaled freely, achieving a pseudo-three-dimensional appearance. 1UP.com have credited the use of Mode 7 with giving the game graphics which at the time of release were considered to be [...] "breathtaking". Retrospective reflection on the Mode 7 visuals was mixed, with IGN stating that the once revolutionary technology <b>now</b> <b>looks</b> [...] "crude and flickery" [...] while the Video Game Bible describes them as [...] "beautiful" [...] and adding to the game. Super Mario Kart featured a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) chip; DSPs were used in SNES games as they provided a better handling of floating point calculations to assist with three-dimensional maths. The DSP-1 chip that was used in Super Mario Kart went on to be the most popular DSP chip to be used in SNES games. The music for the title was created by composer Soyo Oka.|$|E

"It {{took the}} Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya Harding {{spectacle}} {{to open a}} few eyes, but Lavalle, who was looked upon skeptically last summer when he predicted high Nielsens for Olympic figure skating, <b>now</b> <b>looks</b> like a genius.

2500|$|The strip {{underwent}} stylistic changes, evolving {{from the}} realistic {{style of the}} 1978–83 strips, to a more cartoonish look from 1984 onward. This change has mainly affected Garfield's design, which underwent a [...] "Darwinian evolution" [...] in which he began walking on his hind legs, [...] "slimmed down", and [...] "stopped looking [...] through squinty little eyes". His evolution, according to Davis, was {{to make it easier}} to [...] "push Odie off the table" [...] or [...] "reach for a piece of pie". Jon also underwent physiological changes. He <b>now</b> <b>looks</b> older than in the 1990 strips - he is taller and he has larger features.|$|E
2500|$|No.72 Fenchurch was {{purchased}} by the Bluebell Railway in 1964. After much initial use, the locomotive was retired for overhaul in 1970, and returned to traffic in 1972 for its centenary. [...] However, it was withdrawn in 1975, and with a new firebox re-entered service in 1980, running until 1988. At its next overhaul, the need to replace one pair of the original wrought iron wheels due to the detection of cracks in a wheel-hub meant the locomotive was not returned to traffic until 2001. [...] Although carrying an A1X boiler, the smokebox was rebuilt during that overhaul such that it <b>now</b> <b>looks</b> very similar to its original A1 form.|$|E

2500|$|An initial {{burst of}} copies were {{probably}} connected with Philip's fund-raising for his rescue of Constantinople. The Bishop of Cambrai from 1439 to 1479 was John of Burgundy, Philip the Good's illegitimate half-brother, and in June 1455 the cathedral chapter commissioned twelve copies from Hayne of Brussels for twenty pounds, of {{which one is}} believed to survive, now in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. Like the van der Weyden in Houston, this freely interprets the Cambrai original in a contemporary Netherlandish style; the Madonna's faces are of a Northern European type, and their bodies fuller.

According to Mann, the girl’s mother shot her boyfriend in the face with a [...]22 several months later. In court the mother “testified that while she worked nights at a local truck stop he was ‘at home partying and harassing my daughter.’” Mann said “the child put it to me somewhat more directly.” Mann says that she <b>now</b> <b>looks</b> at this photograph with “a jaggy chill of realization.” ...|$|E
2500|$|L'Avventura {{influenced}} the visual language of cinema, changing how subsequent films looked, {{and has been}} named by some critics {{as one of the}} best ever made. However, it has been criticized by others for its seemingly uneventful plot and slow pacing, along with the existentialist themes. Youngblood has stated that [...] "very few films in the history of cinema have broken the standard rules of cinematic grammar so elegantly, so subtly, as this film." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum has called it a masterpiece. Roger Ebert said that he came to like the film later in life when he began to admire the [...] "clarity and passion Antonioni brought to the film's silent cry of despair." [...] Geoff Andrew of Time Out criticized the film, writing that [...] "If it once seemed the ultimate in arty, intellectually chic movie-making, the film <b>now</b> <b>looks</b> all too studied and remote a portrait of emotional sterility." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune defended the film against Andrew's criticism, saying that [...] "It's easy to bash Antonioni as passe. It's harder, I think, to explain the cinematic power of the way his camera watches, and waits, while the people on screen stave off a dreadful loneliness." ...|$|E
