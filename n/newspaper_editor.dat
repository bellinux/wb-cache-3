Gopalakrishnan praised him for his performance, expressing the difficulties of performing as oneself onscreen.|$|E
40|$|The news {{selection}} process of African-American <b>newspaper</b> <b>editors</b> {{in terms of}} news about Africa, was evaluated by addressing two research questions: (i) How do African-American <b>newspaper</b> <b>editors</b> decide which African news to publish? (11) What influences their decision about {{the quantity and quality}} of coverage? A two-page questionnaire was mailed to African-American <b>newspaper</b> <b>editors</b> in 1991 and 1992. The study hypothesized that editors' perceptions of a foreign news event had a direct and significant impact on the way they process the news stories they receive daily. The study reveals that gatekeeping practices of African-American <b>newspaper</b> <b>editors</b> were basically similar to those of other western editors. This was not surprising given the similarity in their education, environment and newsroom socialization. The African-American <b>newspaper</b> <b>editors</b> are distinct, however, in subject matter of reporting. African-American <b>newspaper</b> <b>editors</b> think though, that positive involvement of the United States in the affairs of African countries would positively influence the education of the American public about the heritage of African-Americans. The reporting and issues in African-American newspapers were also investigated...|$|R

However, one editor of the Business Recorder claimed the group was founded in 1958 by the merger of the Pakistan <b>Newspapers</b> <b>Editors</b> Conference and <b>Newspapers</b> <b>Editors</b> Council of Pakistan.

5|$|Alternative {{theories}} were advanced. Some {{surmised that}} the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the river bank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local <b>newspaper</b> <b>editor</b> theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.|$|E
5|$|Dallas {{was elected}} {{as part of}} a {{coalition}} between the Democratic Party organization and reforming independents who wished to challenge the Republican city government. The reforms in question focused many on shifting power from the city council to the mayor and in converting the longstanding patronage system to convert to a merit system of city employment. Her reformist tendencies clashed with some of the party organization, and she went down to defeat in 1955. After a second career as a <b>newspaper</b> <b>editor</b> and investment banker, she retired in 1978 and died in 1983.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a {{favorite}} subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. Herblock's cartoon that coined the term McCarthyism appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1953, the popular daily comic strip Pogo introduced the character Simple J. Malarkey, a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with an unmistakable physical resemblance to McCarthy. After a worried Rhode Island <b>newspaper</b> <b>editor</b> protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator Walt Kelly began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features. The explanation was that Malarkey was hiding from a Rhode Island Red hen, a clear reference to the controversy over the Malarkey character.|$|E

The next year, Wilkes and a friend started publishing National Police Gazette, a newspaper dealing with crime reporting and other sensationalistic topics. In 1856 Wilkes bought a sporting newspaper called The Spirit of the Times, which he had previously worked for.

Wilkes also wrote a couple of books on non-sporting topics as well as introducing pari-mutuel betting into the United States.|$|E

Vogt supported Thommessen in his decision, and came {{at odds with the}} chairman of Morgenbladets board, lawyer and politician Edmund Harbitz. Both left Morgenbladet in the summer of 1913 {{as a result of the}} disaccord, although Vogt continued as theatre and literature critic in the paper until his 1927 death. As editor, Vogt was succeeded by C. J. Hambro.|$|E
