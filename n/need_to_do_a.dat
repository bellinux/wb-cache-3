500|$|In July 2007, {{a dispute}} arose between Harry Potters British publisher, Bloomsbury, and Asda, a British {{supermarket}} chain {{owned by the}} US corporation Wal-Mart. On 15 July, {{a week before the}} release of the final Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Asda issued a press release accusing Bloomsbury of unfairly fixing their prices. Asda spokesman Peter Pritchard claimed that Bloomsbury was [...] "holding children to ransom" [...] and that, [...] "t seems like Bloomsbury <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> quid-ditch as they have sent their prices up north on the Hogwarts Express. By setting the recommended retail price at this level can only be seen [...] as blatant profiteering on their part." [...] Pritchard {{went on to say that}} Asda was acting to [...] "champion the right of young readers", and that the recommended retail price was [...] "twice the average child's pocket money and £5 more than the average children's bestseller". Asda had planned to sell the book as a loss leader at £8.87 ($16.30), or half Bloomsbury's recommended retail price of £17.99 ($33.00) and below the wholesale price of £9.89 ($18.00).|$|E

An editor from the website Music Times compared the minimal production {{on the track}} to that of Azalea's previous single [...] "Fancy" [...] featuring Charli XCX (2014), writing that [...] "It's not quite as catchy as 'Fancy,' {{but it is still}} a lot of fun." [...] Brennan Carley of Spin opined that the background on [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] was similar to works done by Diplo. He further shared that, [...] "she'll <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> little better than 'Iggy SZN' if she wants to keep anyone's interest." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News commented [...] "the star doubles down on her love of 'fancy' (read: gimmicky) hooks, pitting a shrill beat, a lion's roar and a nagging synth against one another for attention." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator, while reviewing Reclassified, said that, [...] "Of the trio of fuck-you anthems, 'Iggy SZN' is the most light-hearted and upbeat. It showcases Iggy's knack for memorable quips – 'what they make in a year, I can make in a week' – and The Invisible Men's ability to deliver crazy beats." [...] Rory Cashin of State added that the song is [...] "built on hand claps and a deep electronic buzz, which will sound great in a high tempo Zumba class." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic also complimented [...] "Iggy SZN" [...] stating that it [...] "is wonderful schoolyard silliness and helps to add some charm to Iggy's ice-queen persona".|$|E

60|$|The {{identical}} Peter wears a huge greatcoat threadbare and patched itself, yet carefully so disposed {{and secured}} by what buttons remain, and many supplementary pins, as {{to conceal the}} still more infirm state of his under garments. The shoes and stockings of a ploughman were, however, seen to meet at his knees {{with a pair of}} brownish, blackish breeches; a rusty-coloured handkerchief, that has been black in its day, surrounded his throat, and was an apology for linen. His hair, half grey, half black, escaped in elf-locks around a huge wig, made of tow, as it seemed to me, and so much shrunk that it stood up on the very top of his head; above which he plants, when covered, an immense cocked hat, which, like the chieftain's banner in an ancient battle, may be seen any sederunt day betwixt nine and ten, high towering above all the fluctuating and changeful scene in the Outer House, where his eccentricities often make him the centre of a group of petulant and teasing boys, who exercise upon him every art of ingenious torture. His countenance, originally that of a portly, comely burgess, is now emaciated with poverty and anxiety, and rendered wild by an insane lightness about the eyes; a withered and blighted skin and complexion; features begrimed with snuff, charged with the self-importance peculiar to insanity; and a habit of perpetually speaking to himself.

Ay, my friends, {{it would}} be sad and dreary news indeed; and this earth {{would be a very}} sad and dreary place; and life with all its {{troubles}} and temptations, would not be worth having, {{if it were not for}} the blessed news which the Gospel for this day brings us. That makes up for all the sadness of the Epistle; that gives us hope; that tells us of one who has been through life, and through death too, yet without sin. That tells us of one who has endured a thousand times more temptation than we ever shall, a thousand times more trouble than we ever shall, and yet has conquered it all; and that He who has thus been through all our temptations, borne all our weaknesses, is our King, our Saviour, who loves us, who teaches us, who has promised us His Holy Spirit, to make us like Himself, strong, brave, and patient, to endure all that man or devil, or our own low animal tempers and lusts, can do to hurt us. The Gospel for this day tells us how He went and was alone in the wilderness with the wild beasts, and yet trusted in God, His Father and ours, to keep Him safe. How He went without food forty days and nights, and yet in His extreme hunger, refused to do the least self-willed or selfish thing to get Himself food. Is that no lesson, no message of hope for the poor man who is tempted by hunger to steal, or tempted by <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> mean and selfish thing, to hear that the Lord Jesus Christ, who bore need and hunger far worse than his, understands all his temptations, and feels for him, and pities him, and has promised him God's Spirit to make him strong, as He himself was? ...|$|E
