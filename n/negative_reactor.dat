50|$|Since steep {{temperature}} gradients will {{be present in}} any such gas core reactor, several implications for neutronics must be considered. The open-cycle gas-core reactor (OCGCR) is typically a thermal/epithermal reactor. Most types of OCGCR require external moderation due to the steep {{temperature gradients}} inside the gaseous core. Neutrons born in the fuel region travel relatively unimpeded to the external moderator where some are thermalized and sent back into the gas core. Due to the high core temperatures, however, on the return trip the neutrons are up scattered in the fuel region, {{which leads to a}} significant <b>negative</b> <b>reactor</b> worth. To achieve criticality, this reactor is operated at very high pressure and the exterior radial wall is made up of a moderator of some sort, generally beryllium oxide. Moderation can also come from introducing moderating particles into either the fuel or propellant streams, but by doing so, the benefits in neutronics is canceled by loss of rocket performance.|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{accuracy of}} tuberculosis {{can be enhanced}} by new tests like gamma interferon {{used in conjunction with}} tuberculin test but these tests are quite expensive to be conducted on all animals in resource poor countries. The present study was conducted to clarify the usefulness of haematological parameters and changes in serum proteins along with tuberculin test in different animal species. In buffaloes, significantly lower RBC count, WBC count, Hb concentration, neutrophils and eosinophils while significantly higher monocytes percentage along with serum total proteins, albumin and globulins were observed in tuberculin positive reactors. In cattle, significantly lower RBC count, PCV, neutrophils and serum albumin, while lymphocyte percentage was significantly higher in positive reactor animals. In sheep, PCV was lower in positive reactors. In goats, basophils percentage was significantly higher (P = 0. 002) in positive reactors. A significant positive correlation of Hb with RBC and PCV in positive reactor buffaloes, goats and sheep was observed. The correlation statistics for differential leukocyte percentage did not differ between positive and <b>negative</b> <b>reactor</b> animals of these species. In cattle and goats, albumin showed significant positive correlation with globulins in negatively reacting animals, while this correlation was non-significant in positive reactor animals. In buffaloes, albumin showed a significant positive correlation with globulins and this correlation was non-significant in <b>negative</b> <b>reactor</b> buffaloes. It was concluded that tuberculosis caused decrease in erythrocyte parameters including RBC count, PCV and Hb concentration, while it caused an increase in monocytes, eosinophils and lymphocytes...|$|E

The object of the investigation was to ascertain whether or not vaccination with vole bacillus vaccine introduced an acclerating factor in the rate of radiological change in pneumoconiosis. The results of the investigation showed that radiological changes in the two groups were minimal and that there was virtually no difference between them. No accelerated changes were recorded in the negative vaccinated group. This is regarded as evidence that anti-tuberculosis vaccine does not introduce an accelerating factor in pneumoconiosis...|$|R
40|$|Summary Small cell {{carcinoma}} (SCC) {{is considered to}} be of neuroendocrine origin. Neurone specific enolase (NSE) and PGP 9. 5 are markers of neural and neuroendocrine differentiation. S- 100 protein is a marker of glial differentiation. The expression of these markers in endobronchial biopsy and lung tumour resection specimens was studied to see if any diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic implications would emerge. Zamboni fixed endobronchial tumour biopsy specimens from 20 patients were examined. Twelve of these were cases of SCC and 8 were non-SCC. Of the 12 SCC, 7 were positive for NSE, 6 for PGP 9. 5 and 5 for S- 100 protein. Cases which showed a positive reaction for NSE had a mean survival of 9. 1 months compared with 3. 9 months for those with a negative reaction, but the number of cases is too small to assign any statistical significance. There was no difference in survival times between positive and <b>negative</b> <b>reactors</b> for PGP 9. 5 and S- 100 protein. All 8 cases of non-SCC showed positive reactions to all three markers. Of 32 formalin fixed lung tumour resection specimens 6 were cases of SCC, 25 non-SCC and a chemodectoma.

We investigated the effect of TGF-β and IL- 10 on T cell subsets according to the Th 1 /Th 2 immune status. Sixty-two patients with asthma and 38 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were included. Allergy skin tests, tuberculin tests, and chest radiography were performed. The levels of circulating IL- 4, IFN-γ, TGF-β 1, and IL- 10 were measured using ELISA. The level of TGF-β 1 was higher in patients with asthma than in those with tuberculosis, but the IL- 10 levels were the same between the asthma and tuberculosis groups. Atopy was unrelated to the tuberculin response. The IFN-γ level was correlated with the IL- 10 level, and the level of IL- 4 was unrelated to the IL- 10 or TGF-β 1 level. The level of IL- 10 was higher in the <b>negative</b> tuberculin <b>reactors</b> than in the positive tuberculin reactors among patients with asthma, and TGF-β 1 was higher in the positive tuberculin reactors than in the <b>negative</b> tuberculin <b>reactors</b> among patients with tuberculosis.

40|$|A mouse {{monoclonal}} antibody (MAB 9. 9) to coagulation factor IX (F. IX) detects a polymorphism in the plasma of normal people. Its epitope has been narrowed down to < 6 amino acids in the activation peptide of the X-linked F. IX protein. The activation peptide contains a dimorphism—Thr:Ala—at position 148 of the protein. Using synthetic oligonucleotides, we {{have demonstrated that}} (1) the F. IX which reacts with 9. 9 has Thr at position 148 and (2) that which does not has Ala. Positive reactors (148 thr) are designated Malmö A, and <b>negative</b> <b>reactors</b> (148 ala) are designated Malmö B. The plasma levels of AA women are indistinguishable from those of A men, and both B men and BB women are null against MAB 9. 9. The plasma level of Malmö A in AB women is approximately half that of AA women, and “lyonization” is clearly operating in the heterozygotes. The dimorphism is in strong linkage disequilibrium with two other intragenic RFLPs, TaqI and XmnI. Furthermore, intragenic crossing-over—including double crossing-over—appears to have occurred between the three sites. Seven of the eight possible haplotypes have been identified, five in men and two others in women. The immunoassay that identifies ∼ 50 % of the AB women in the pool of Malmö A females with 95 % confidence identifies men unambiguously as A or B. The assay would be very useful for population-genetic studies of the Malmö epitope if the studies were limited to men...|$|R

In the chemotherapy group, 45 patients had negative reactions initially, and 25 patients (55 %) {{had at least}} one skin test convert to positive in an average period of 19 days of IVH. In the surgery group, 23 patients (46 %) were initially positive and remained positive, 13 patients (24 %) converted from negative to positive, and 13 patients (30 %) remained negative or converted to negative. Postoperative complications occurred in 25 % of positive reactors, compared with 69 % (p < 0. 01) of <b>negative</b> <b>reactors.</b> In the radiation therapy group, the skin tests of six patients (30 %) remained positive, three patients (15 %) converted from negative to positive and the skin tests of nine patients (45 %) remained negative.

A recombinant p 24 (rp 24) was expressed in the Escherichia coli expression system, purified in a nickel charged resin and used as antigen in the ELISA test. A cut-off point was established considering the distribution of reactivity values obtained by rp 24 -ELISA on a set of 555 field serum samples that were stated as double positive (DP) or double negative (DN) by the combination of commercial agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) assay and gp 51 -ELISA tests results. The rp 24 -ELISA showed good concordance with the agar gel immunodiffusion assay, when 710 serum samples were analyzed. In addition, rp 24 -ELISA demonstrated to be a precise assay with good repeatability and reproducibility and a better analytical sensitivity than AGID. From 67 discordant rp 24 -ELISA-AGID sera, 4 <b>negative</b> <b>reactors</b> were from the DP group, 28 positive samples were from the DN group and 35 positive samples were stated as negative by AGID but positive by the gp 51 -ELISA.

A significant TGF-ß 1 concentration was detected in the LST +ve and LST –ve controls than in the CL, ML, and PKDL patients. Cytokines levels were measured before and after Ambisome therapy for 3 ML patients and they showed a non significant increase in concentrations of IL- 10, TGF-ß 1, and IL- 4 while significant reductions in IFN-γ and TNF- α concentrations were detected. IFN-γ increased with the duration of lesion in CL patient and it was higher in the supernatants stimulated with the homologous parasite.

Those strains that had been isolated most recently were more resistant to bactericidal action. However, there was considerable variation between the strains within this group;The plasma of White Leghorns of two different strains showed higher bactericidal activity than that of Rhode Island Reds and White Rocks. The greater bactericidal action of the plasma of White Leghorns may partially account for less infection being observed in this breed;The bactericidal activity of the plasma was not influenced by body weight, body condition, sexual maturity or molting, as these factors were measured in this study;The variation between tests made during an eight-week period were small. Changes in the organisms and the fowls, as they were reflected in the bactericidal activity of the plasma, were not significant;The bactericidal action of the plasma apparently involves a natural antibody and complement. The plasma of fowls showing low bactericidal activity was apparently not deficient in complement;Fowls which reacted positively to the agglutination test for pullorum disease showed little bactericidal action.

This trend of high prevalence of TB among human patients in the area is similar to the trend observed among cattle populations; thus indicating a relationship between the disease in human and infection in cattle. In addition, a significant difference in the prevalence of the disease was observed between male and female patients with more positive cases observed among male patients.

Results: Frequency of Vα 24 Vβ 11 NKT cells in the new case TB and MDRTB patients as compared to PPD positive healthy donors was significantly decreased (P< 0. 05), whereas CD 3 CD 56 NKT cell numbers were similar in all groups. Conclusion: According to our results decrease in frequency of Vα 24 Vβ 11 NKT cells may be related to insufficient immune responses to mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, especially in MDRTB patients...|$|R
40|$|We have {{assessed}} {{the feasibility of}} producing heavy negative ion beams as drivers for an inertial confinement fusion <b>reactor.</b> <b>Negative</b> ion beams offer the potentially important advantages relative to positive ions {{that they will not}} draw electrons from surfaces and the target chamber plasma during acceleration, compression and focusing, and they will not have a low energy tail. Intense negative ion beams could also be efficiently converted to atomically neutral beams by photodetachment prior to entering the target chamber. Depending on the target chamber pressure, this atomic beam will undergo ionization as it crosses the chamber, but at chamber pressures at least as high as 1. 3 x 10 - 4 Torr, there may still be significant improvements in the beam spot size on the target, due to the reduction in path-averaged self-field perveance. The halogens, with their large electron affinities, are the best negative ion candidates. Fluorine and chlorine are the easiest halogens to use for near-term source experiments, whereas bromine and iodine best meet present expectations of driver mass. With regard to ion sources and photodetachment neutralizers, this approach should be feasible with existing technology. Except for the target chamber, the vacuum requirements for accelerating and transporting high energy negative ions are essentially the same as for positive ions. ...|$|R

From that time and up to the seventeenth century, little or nothing is known about the occurrence of the disease. A few preserved descriptions of diseases and deaths indicate that tuberculosis has existed in the country before the advent of qualified physicians in 1760. On the basis of papers and reports from the first physicians and the first tuberculosis registers the opinions is set forth that the disease has been rare up to {{the latter part of the}} nineteenth century. During the two last decades of that century the disease began to spread more rapidly and increased steadily up to the turn of the century. Although reporting of the disease was started in the last decade of the nineteenth century the reporting was first ordered by law with the passage of the first tuberculosis Act in the year 1903. With this legislation official measures for tuberculosis control work really started in the country. The first sanatorium was built in 1910. In 1921 the tuberculosis Act was revised and since then practically all the expenses for the hospitalization and treatment of tuberculous cases has been defrayed by the state. In the year 1935 organized tuberculosis control work was begun and a special physician appointed to direct it. From then on systematic surveys were made, partly in health centers i. e. tuberculosis clinics, which were established in the main towns, and partly by means of transportable X ray units in outlying rural areas of the country. In 1939 the tuberculosis Act was again revised with special reference to the surveys and the activities of the tuberculosis clinics. This act is still in force. Some items of it are described. The procedure of the surveys and the methods of examination are described. The great majority of subjects were tuberculin tested and all positive reactors X rayed. Furthermore, X ray examination was made in all cases where tuberculin examination had not been made or was incomplete. The <b>negative</b> <b>reactors</b> were not X rayed. The tuberculin tests were percutaneous, cutaneous and intracutaneous. The X ray examination during the first years was performed by means of fluoroscopy and roentgenograms were made in all doubtful cases. In 1945 when the survey of the capital city of Reykjavík was made and comprised a total of 43, 595 persons photoroentgenograms were made. After 1948 only this method together with tuberculin testing was used in all the larger towns in the country. During the period 1940 - 1945 such surveys were carried out in 12 medical districts, or parts thereof and included 58, 837 persons or 47 percent of the entire population. The attendance in these surveys ranged from 89. 3 percent to 100 percent of those considered able to attend. In the capital city, Reykjavík, the attendance was 99. 32 percent. The course and prevalence of tuberculosis in Iceland from 1911 to 1970 are traced on the basis of tuberculosis reporting registers, mortality records which were ordered by law in 1911, tuberculin surveys and post mortem examinations. The deficiencies of these sources are pointed out. Since 1939 the morbidity rates are accurate. The number of reported cases of tuberculosis increases steadily up to the year 1935, when 1. 6 percent of the population is reported to have active tuberculosis at the end of that year. Thereafter it begins to decline gradually the first years but abruptly in 1939, then without doubt because of the revision of the tuberculosis legislation and more exact reporting regulations. After that year the fall is almost constant with rather small fluctuations as regards new cases, relapses and total number of reported cases remaining on register at the end of each year. In 1950 the new cases are down to 1. 6 per thousand and at the end of the year the rate for those remaining on register is 6. 9 per thousand. In the year 1954 there is a noteworthy drop both in new cases and the total number reported, doubtless because of the new specific medication which began in 1952. In 1960 the new cases are down to 0. 4, relapses 0. 2 and the rate for those remaining on register at the end of the year 2. 4 per thousand. And in 1970 the rate for the same categories are: new 0. 2, relapses 0. 06, and remaining at the end of the year 0. 5 per thousand. At the beginning of the period, when registration of deaths was initiated, tuberculosis mortality was found to be about 150 per 100, 000 population. During the next two decades it increases, irregularly but persistently, to reach a peak of 217 in 1925. It remained high for the next seven years, dropped suddenly to 154 in 1933, and then, apart from a slight temporary increase during the years of the second world war, continued to fall rapidly reaching 20 per 100, 000 population in 1950. In the period from 1930 - 50 the tuberculous death rate thus dropped a little over 90 percent. In the year 1952, when specific tuberculosis medical treatment was initiated (streptomycin, isoniazid and PAS) the death rate dropped to 14 per 100, 000 population and the next year further down to 9 and since 1956 it never exceeded 5 per 100, 000. From the year 1962 the tuberculosis mortality has never been over 2 per 100, 000 population. The mortality rates have been broken down to reveal the role of age and sex specific death rates over some selected five year periods. Also the rates are shown according to different forms of the disease, pulmonary, meningeal and other forms. The highest proportionate mortality (60...|$|R
40|$|Sero-epidemiological {{investigations}} on {{the prevalence}} of Trypanosoma equiperdum (Doflein, 1901) in horses in Mongolia. The objective of the investigation was to generate data for the prevalence-estimation of dourine in horses in the central province (Tuv-aimag) of Mongolia. The field investigations were carried out from May 2000 until July 2000. At least four herds of horses were chosen by random selection {{from each of the}} 26 central aimag subdivisions (= total 119 herds). 10 horses per herd, stratified for age and sex within the herds were sampled and examined (= total 1190 horses). Herd sizes varied between 10 and 280 animals, the median was 33 animals. In 17. 6 % of the herds the condition of the animals was assessed as bad, in 51. 3 % as medium and in 31. 3 % as good. Particularly herds in Mungunmorit, in the northeast of the central aimag and in Buren, in the southwest of the aimag, were in very bad condition at the time of examination. The horses were cachectic and emaciated. According to owner information an increased number of abortions in these herds was observed. Owners of 54 herds (45. 4 %) reported such increased abortions. Furthermore, owners´ reports frequently contained nasal discharge, cough and infestation of ticks. By individual examination, the nutritional status of 14. 2 % of animals was classified as bad, 74. 2 % as medium and 11. 2 % as good. The herd owners held the hard winter 1999 / 2000 responsible for the high number of animal losses, the bad nutrition of their herds and the increased occurrences of abortions. From the total of 1190 horses blood samples were taken. All serum samples were examined for antibodies against T. equiperdum by CFT and by indirect ELISA. From the eventually 1122 tested serum samples 85 (7. 6 %) were positive in the CFT and 75 (6. 7 %) in the ELISA. CFT and ELISA results showed good (96 %) diagnostic agreement. 1017 negative and 55 positive CFT reactors were confirmed by ELISA. 30 positive and 20 <b>negative</b> CFT <b>reactors,</b> however, did not agree with the ELISA results. These differences may have been due to the use of different antigen preparations for both tests or by partly different immunoglobulin isotypes targeted by either test. The majority of herds (65 % in CFT, 66. 7 % in ELISA) was sero-negative. The CFT revealed one positive reactor in 16 herds (1 / 10), two positive reactors in another 16 herds (2 / 10), three positives in two herds (3 / 10), four positives in five herds (4 / 10) and 5 (5 / 10) resp. 6 (6 / 10) positive reactors each in one herd. The ELISA revealed one positive reactor in 21 herds (1 / 10), two positive reactors in eight herds (2 / 10), three positive reactors in four herds (3 / 10) and four positives in five herds (4 / 10). In one herd six animals reacted positively in the ELISA. One herd in Mungunmorit soum had the highest number of sero-positive animals (CFT and/or ELISA), followed by herds in Bayandelger soum and Bajanzagaan soum, Zeel soum and Argalant soum. Herds with at least three (3 / 10) sero-positive animals (CFT and/or ELISA) were examined by PCR using a Trypanozoon-specific primer pair. From 130 whole blood samples eight samples were positive in the PCR. Five of the eight PCR-positive animals responded positively in both tests (CFT and ELISA). Two PCR-positive samples were either positive in CFT or ELISA. One sample which reacted positively in the PCR was sero-negative (CFT and ELISA). The clinical examination of the horses identified one stallion with a oedematous skin plaque and scrotal and preputial oedema. The sample of this stallion was negative in the CFT but positive in ELISA and PCR. Three mares with vaginal discharge were sero-positive, but negative in the PCR. Four horses with skin nodes presumably caused by horse-flies, reacted positively in all tests. Blood smears were prepared from three animals per herd. The smears of those horses positive for dourine in CFT and/or ELISA were Giemsa stained and examined by microscopy. None of these blood smears showed any trypanosomes. The serological CFT and ELISA results and the detection of trypanosomal DNA in the PCR confirm {{the prevalence of}} trypanosome infections in some herds of horses in the central aimag of Mongolia. Since at present neither the two serological tests nor the PCR permit to differentiate between the two subspecies Trypanosoma equiperdum (causative agent of dourine) and Trypanosoma evansi (causative agent of surra) a final diagnosis cannot be made. On the basis of the clinical findings, the negative parasitological results and the concentration of conspicuous sero-prevalences in single herds, the existence of infections with the causative agent of dourine are hypothesized. Longitudinal studies in high prevalence herds aimed at identification of trypanosome parasites are needed...|$|R
