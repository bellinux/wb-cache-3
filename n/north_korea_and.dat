5|$|Starting in 2005, <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> <b>and</b> South Korea held {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} possibility of sending a united team to the 2008 Olympics. The proposal failed, because of disagreements about how athletes would be chosen; North Korea was demanding a certain percentage representation for its athletes. A subsequent attempt to broker an agreement for the two nations to walk together during the March of Nations failed as well, despite their having done so during the 2000 and 2004 Games.|$|E
5|$|Use of CS in war is {{prohibited}} {{under the terms}} of the Chemical Weapons Convention, signed by most nations in 1993 with all but five other nations signing between 1994 and 1997. The reasoning behind the prohibition is pragmatic: use of CS by one combatant could easily trigger retaliation with much more toxic chemical weapons such as nerve agents. Only four nations have not signed the Chemical Weapons Convention and are therefore unhindered by restrictions on the use of CS gas: Angola, Egypt, <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> <b>and</b> Somalia.|$|E

5|$|A major railway, {{known as}} the Eurasian Land Bridge allows goods to be transported from China and the EEU to Europe.

In June 2014, {{it was announced that}} Russia, <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> <b>and</b> South Korea would cooperate to expand the Eurasian Land Bridge to connect the peninsula. Advantages of exporting products by rail through the EEU are reduced shipping times and reduced costs. The railways also have the potential for expansion, with the future creation of high-speed railway lines being considered.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Taiwan and China, Rammasun began weakening due to {{an approaching}} trough, which turned the typhoon northeastward. It passed over the Japanese island of Miyako-jima and also produced strong winds in Okinawa. About 10,000houses lost power on the island, and high surf killed two sailors. On the Japanese mainland, there was light crop damage and one serious injury. After weakening to a tropical storm, Rammasun passed {{just west of the}} South Korean island of Cheju-do, killing one person from high waves. The storm crossed the country, killing three others and leaving $9.5million in damage. High rains also affected <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> <b>and</b> Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{deployment}} to Syria of several new Russian military systems, various countries had reportedly {{expressed interest in}} the Su-35. These countries included Algeria, Egypt, and Vietnam. According to Kommersant, the Algerian military had requested an Su-35 for testing in February 2016; the country was satisfied with the fighter's flight characteristics and so Moscow is waiting for a formal application. It is expected that the first phase {{will focus on the}} acquisition of at least twelve aircraft. Other countries that had also expressed interest in the aircraft include Kazakhstan, <b>North</b> <b>Korea,</b> <b>and</b> Pakistan, although a Russian official denied that the country was in talks with the latter about the Su-35.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) by its northern neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (<b>North</b> <b>Korea)</b> <b>and</b> the subsequent outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, the United Nations decided to enter the conflict on behalf of South Korea. The United States—a member of the UN—subsequently committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing. However, U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division, headquartered in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war between <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> <b>and</b> South Korea on June 25, 1950, the United States mobilized a large contingent of troops to send into the beleaguered country. Initially, units occupying Japan were called into the country, but forces were eventually dispatched from the United States. In August 1950, Kouma, who was then a Sergeant First Class, sailed for Korea along {{with much of the}} 2nd Infantry Division. It arrived there in late August and was moved into line at the Pusan Perimeter, where US troops were fighting a tight defensive line around the port city of Pusan.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the UN advances, China's Chairman, Mao Zedong, ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to enter <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> <b>and</b> engage UN forces under the name People's Volunteer Army (PVA). In order to stabilize the rapidly collapsing Korean front and to push back the advancing UN forces, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead-building operation {{with the aim of}} destroying the ROK II Corps, the vanguard and the right flank of the US Eighth Army, advancing up along the Taebaek Mountains {{in the middle of the}} peninsula. After the Chinese leadership finally settled the issue of armed intervention on October 18, Mao ordered the PVA to enter Korea on October 19 under strict secrecy.|$|E
