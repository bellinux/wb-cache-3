On 3 April 2008, Jules Verne succeeded in automatically docking with the ISS, proving the capabilities of the ESA's first fully automated, expendable cargo resupply spacecraft. The arrival of the ATV came at a time at which there were public concerns over the logistical practicality of supplying the ISS.|$|R
5|$|The {{fair and}} the city were {{the setting of the}} Elvis Presley movie It Happened at the World's Fair (1963), with a young Kurt Russell making his first screen appearance.

25|$|Low {{levels of}} {{damaging}} forces produce small bruises and generally cause {{the individual to}} feel minor pain straight away. Repeated impacts worsen bruises, increasing the harm level. Normally, light bruises heal <b>nearly</b> completely within <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> although duration is affected by variation in severity and individual healing processes; generally, more severe or deeper bruises take somewhat longer.|$|R
5000|$|A perigean {{spring tide}} is a tide that occurs {{three or four}} times a year when the Moon's perigee (its closest point to Earth during its 28-day {{elliptical}} orbit) coincides with a spring tide (when the Earth, Sun and Moon are <b>nearly</b> aligned every <b>two</b> <b>weeks).</b> [...] This tide usually adds only a couple of inches to normal spring tides.|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980, {{although}} the Scandinavian population is growing. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> Once the eggs are hatched, both {{the male and}} female will feed the chicks.|$|E

Due to overwhelming response to the post, the city organized a candle light vigil that evening with several hundred residents attending. Prayers were offered in several languages, including French, and several faiths. Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr. and Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski spoke. The candle remained lit for three days before being shut off until the official lighting event.|$|E

There are complaints by shopkeepers against tramcar drivers who let their horses and cars stand outside the shop. There are records of payments to tramcar drivers who acted bravely in restraining horses which were startled and bolted. Despite the imminent introduction of electric cars, the horse tram rails still required maintenance, and the minute book records that the track outside the Mechanics Institute was replaced at the end of 1897.|$|R
5000|$|The shallow-trench latrine {{is similar}} to the slit-trench latrine but is wider (200-300mm wide) than the latter. It is also shallow, with a depth of about 150 mm. This type of latrine is often used in the initial phases of {{emergencies}} and is a simple improvement on open defecation fields. [...] A rule of thumb in emergency sanitation provision is to allow 0.25 m2 of land per person per day. This means 2,500m2 per 10,000 people per day, or <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> hectares per <b>week.</b> Men’s and women’s areas should always be separated.|$|R
40|$|Total ozone {{observations}} from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments during March 1997 revealed an extensive region of low column densities in the Arctic region centered near the north pole. Values were below 250 Dobson units for <b>nearly</b> a <b>two</b> <b>week</b> period during this period, and {{were correlated with}} {{the position of the}} northern lower stratospheric polar vortex. The March 1997 average total ozone column densities were more than 30 % lower than the average of column densities observed during the 1979 - 1982 March period. Both the northern spring seasons of 1998 and 1999 have shown much higher levels of total ozone. In this presentation, we will discuss the causes of the low total ozone values in 1997 and contrast those low values with the higher 1998 and 1999 observations. I will additionally discuss the just completed SOLVE campaign and the March 2000 ozone values...|$|R

Two weeks later he hit two home runs with six RBIs in a 16-1 win over the New York Yankees. In May, Hanigan, plagued for <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> by a {{strained}} hamstring, was finally placed on the 15-day DL on May 28. On June 17 he had a home run and a walk against the Baltimore Orioles, but he then missed several more games due to neck stiffness and later with soreness in his left side.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey through}} Switzerland continued, with concerts at Lausanne and Zurich. Since leaving the Netherlands, Wolfgang had {{composed}} little; a minor harpsichord piece, K. 33B, {{written for the}} Zürich concerts, and later some cello pieces (since lost) written for the Prince of Fürstenberg. The prince received the party on 20 October, on its arrival in Donaueschingen on the German border, for a stay of some 12 days. Resuming their journey, they reached Munich on 8 November. They were delayed here for <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> after Wolfgang fell ill, but he was well enough to perform before the Elector, with Nannerl, on 22 November. A few days later they set out for Salzburg, arriving at their home on the Getreidegasse on 29 November 1766.|$|E
5|$|For <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> the French frigates {{remained}} at anchor, Malcolm and Grant drawing up {{plans for an}} attack with fireships, when Amazone successfully slipped out of harbour on 27 November, returning successfully to Le Havre before dawn the following day. With Amazone gone, Grant maintained a closer watch on Elisa, calling up a bomb vessel to attack the anchorage on 6 December. This proved no more accurate than the rockets, but Elisa was again driven into shallow waters to avoid the attack, this time becoming irretrievably grounded on a shoal. Over {{the next two weeks}} Elisa remained grounded, the frigate gradually being reduced to the state of a total wreck. On 23 December Grant sent his boats, commanded by Lieutenant Thomas Rowe, into the anchorage under cover of darkness and set the wreck on fire to ensure that the frigate's stores could not be salvaged.|$|E

50|$|After <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> quiet <b>weeks,</b> {{the fourth}} {{tropical}} storm {{of the season}} developed about 105 miles (170 km) west-southwest of George Town, Cayman Islands, at 06:00 UTC on July 14. For two more days, the system drifted west-northwest, gradually strengthening. On July 16, the cyclone began turning to the northeast and accelerated. It reached hurricane status at 12:00 UTC on July 17 and passed just west of Cuba later that day. Its path then bent to the north-northeast, and early the next day, the storm attained its first peak intensity of 80 mph (130 km/h) as its eye neared {{the west coast of}} the Florida peninsula. Around 01:00 UTC on July 19, the hurricane made landfall near Ozello, Florida, at that intensity. The storm soon lost hurricane status as it swiftly turned to the east-northeast, briskly crossing North Florida en route to the Atlantic Ocean. At 00:00 UTC on July 20, the storm recovered hurricane status while centered about 140 miles (225 km) south-southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina, and six hours later attained its second and strongest peak of 85 mph (140 km/h). The storm acquired extratropical characteristics early on July 23, and after curving to the northeast over the far north Atlantic, it dissipated at 18:00 UTC on July 24.|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September16 with copious convection. It tracked westward, developing into Tropical Depression Twelve on September21 while located {{a few hundred miles}} west of Cape Verde. Without intensifying further, the depression turned northward, due to a weakness caused by the deepening of a 200 mbar cut-off low near the Iberian Peninsula. Under the influence of a building high pressure area, the depression turned to a northwest and later westward drift. It into Tropical Storm Josephine on September24, although increased wind shear from a trough weakened the storm back to a tropical depression on September26. It remained weak for several days, gradually turning to the north due to a weak trough over the northwestern Atlantic. On October1, another high pressure area halted its northward movement, causing Josephine to turn to the east. That day, it re-intensified into a tropical storm as it began to execute a small cyclonic loop. An approaching trough caused Josephine to accelerate north-northeastward, and with favorable conditions it intensified into a hurricane on October5, after existing <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is a migratory {{divide in}} Europe at {{longitude}} 10–11°E. Birds {{to the west}} of this line head southwest towards Iberia or West Africa, whereas populations to the east migrate to the eastern Mediterranean and on to East Africa. Cross-breeding in captivity of birds from the resident population on the Canary Islands with migratory blackcaps from Germany showed the urge to migrate is genetically controlled, the offspring showing intermediate behaviour in terms of restlessness at migration time. Similar experiments using birds from southern Germany and eastern Austria, {{on opposite sides of the}} migratory divide, demonstrated that the direction of migration is also genetically determined. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> later than in the 1980s.

5000|$|The {{night after}} the highly praised WrestleMania XIV, McMahon began a feud with fan-favorite Stone Cold Steve Austin. The rivalry, which was cast as a battle between blue collar redneck Austin and white collar {{executive}} McMahon, {{became one of the}} defining storylines of the Attitude Era, as each engaged in ever escalating acts of sabotage and violence against the other. Austins popularity would skyrocket even more with the companys fan base during this time. On April 13, 1998, an advertised Austin vs. McMahon main event was enough for Raw Is War to finally beat Nitro in the ratings {{for the first time in}} <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> years. <b>Two</b> <b>weeks</b> later, the WWF taunted WCWs slipping ratings by sending members of DX to Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, Virginia in an attempt to crash a live taping of Nitro.
