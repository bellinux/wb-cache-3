40|$|The {{expression}} of nerve growth factor receptor in colon from 20 patients with Hirshsprung's disease and 10 controls was studied immunohistochemically. The myenteric and submucous plexuses in the ganglionic bowel and hypertrophic <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in the aganglionic bowel displayed strong {{expression of}} nerve growth factor receptor. The most important finding was the identical localisation of nerve growth factor receptor immunoreactivity on the perineurium of both hypertrophic <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in Hirshsprung's diseases, and of normal extrinsic nerves, {{seen as a}} thick ring surrounding the <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks.</b> This suggests that the hypertrophic <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> are of extrinsic origin and that nerve growth factor receptor {{plays a role in}} their development and maintenance...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose. Palpation of {{peripheral}} <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> {{has been}} advocated {{as a method}} of assessing the presence of hyperalgesic nerve tissue as a contributing factor to pain syndromes in musculoskeletal disorders of the upper quadrant. This study investigated, in the first instance, the pressure pain thresholds of the median, radial and ulnar <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> of the upper limb in healthy, asymptomatic subjects. Method. Forty-five male and 50 female healthy volunteer subjects participated in this study which involved measurement of pressure pain thresholds by use of pressure algometry bilaterally over the three peripheral <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in the upper limbs. Results. Pressure pain thresholds were shown to be lowest in the median nerve (p= 0. 001) and lower in female subjects (p= 0. 001). Laterality (p= 0. 077) or the age of the subject (p= 0. 254) did not significantly influence results. Conclusions. The study demonstrated differences in pressure pain thresholds in the three <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> of the upper limb. These findings should be taken into account when interpreting the findings of nerve palpation in musculoskeletal upper quadrant disorders...|$|R
25|$|When pain {{is blocked}} from {{a part of}} the body using local anesthetics, it is {{generally}} referred to as regional anesthesia. There are many types of regional anesthesia either by injecting into the tissue itself, a vein that feeds the area or around a <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> that supplies sensation to the area. The latter are called nerve blocks and are divided into peripheral or central nerve blocks.|$|E
25|$|Central neuropathic pain {{is found}} in spinal cord injury, {{multiple}} sclerosis, and some strokes. Aside from diabetes (see diabetic neuropathy) and other metabolic conditions, the common causes of painful peripheral neuropathies are herpes zoster infection, HIV-related neuropathies, nutritional deficiencies, toxins, remote manifestations of malignancies, immune mediated disorders and physical trauma to a <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk.</b> Neuropathic pain is common in cancer {{as a direct result}} of cancer on peripheral nerves (e.g., compression by a tumor), or as a side effect of chemotherapy (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy), radiation injury or surgery.|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} the distribution of probable cholinergic nerves in the human adrenal cortex using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry. Adrenal tissue was obtained from three subjects during therapeutic radical nephrectomy for renal neoplastic disease. Light microscopy revealed a heterogeneous pattern of cortical innervation, with nerves most abundant {{in the head and}} body and largely absent from the tail. There was frequently a subcapsular plexus of interwoven AChE + ve <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in close relationship to densely stained (ganglion) cells. Nerves also traversed the zona fasciculata in radial trunks and a further plexus with ganglion cells was observed in the zona reticularis. <b>Nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> were seen to penetrate the medulla. Some <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> appeared to terminate or branch or form individual nerve fibres (often with varicosities) which ramified through the cortical parenchyma. In the medulla, a generalised granular staining was superimposed on <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> which were branched and interwoven to form a plexus around ganglion cells. The presence and distribution of AChE + ve nerve plexuses and varicose nerve fibres is suggestive of a functional intrinsic, probably cholinergic, innervation to the human adrenal cortex, perhaps derived from the splanchnic nerves...|$|R
50|$|In Hirschsprung disease, calretinin {{immunohistochemistry}} offers additional diagnostic {{value in}} specimens with inadequate amount of submucosa and rarely seen ganglion cells. The presence of ganglion cells consistently correlated with calretinin-positive thin nerve fibrils in the lamina propria, muscularis mucosae and superficial submucosa. These calretinin-positive thin neurofibrils are absent in the aganglionic segments of bowel {{and in the}} areas without ganglion cells from the junction of normal with diseased rectum. Calretinin is strongly expressed in the submucosal and subserosal <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in the ganglionic segment. No calretinin expression {{is seen in the}} <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> {{in the rest of the}} aganglionic segment. It has faint expression in the thick <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> from the areas without ganglion cells. Faint positivity of the thick submucosal and subserosal nerves in the absence of ganglion cells and calretinin positive nerve fibrils, is characteristic of the junction of the aganglionic-to-normal rectum.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} calretinin and b-tubulin immunohistochemical expression together with submucosal <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> morphology in differently innervated segments of Hirschsprung disease (HD) and total colonic aganglionosis (TCA). Methods: A total of 25 cases (22 HD, 3 TCA) and 18 controls were processed for calretinin and b-tubulin immunohistochemistry. Sections representative of distal aganglionic, transition, and proximal ganglionic segments were evaluated by a visual grading score; b-tubulin was evaluated also by image analysis. Submucosal <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> hypertrophy and hyperplasia were measured by citomorphology. The length of proximal segment was correlated to postoperative bowel function. Results: Controls showed intense calretinin and b-tubulin staining. In HD and TCA, calretinin staining was related to the presence of ganglion cells: negative in distal, faint in transition, intense in proximal segment. b-Tubulin staining was weak in all of the segments of HD and negative in TCA. Hypertrophic and hyperplastic <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> characterized aganglionic segment, and progressively decreasing nerve size was observed in transition and ganglionic segments. Transient postoperative constipation, soiling, or enterocolitis was present in 59...|$|R

50|$|Epineurial {{electrodes}} are fabricated as longitudinal strips holding {{two or more}} contact {{sites to}} interface with peripheral nerves.

40|$|Clinical and electromyographic(EMG) {{responses}} to non-noxious mechanical stimuli were studied in four patients with painful cervical radiculopathy, {{and in two}} control subjects. In the symptomatic arm(s), palpation over one or more <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> was painful and accompanied by EMG activity, whereas palpation of adjacent soft tissues was painless and unaccompanied by EMG activity. Electromyographic activity was widespread in three patients when myotatic reflexes were elicited in the symptomatic arm(s). In asymptomatic arms of patients and controls, EMG {{responses to}} the myotatic reflexes were more localised. Allodynic <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in cervical radiculopathy appear to be afferent correlates of central sensitisation; the accompanying EMG activity may represent a motor correlate of this same process...|$|R
40|$|The {{source of}} Enteric Nervous System Progenitor Cells present in Aganglionic Gut in Hirschsprung’s disease – George Stephen Bethell The enteric nervous system {{develops}} predominantly from vagal neural crest cells which proliferate and differentiate into enteric neurons and glia whilst migrating to the distal gut. Failure {{of this process}} for unknown reasons results in Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR) which is characterised by an absence of enteric ganglia in a variable length of distal gut. This causes life threatening bowel obstruction and requires surgical intervention to remove the affected bowel. Following surgery 10 - 30 % of patients suffer from long term constipation or faecal incontinence which can worsen with time. Our group has previously shown that enteric nervous system progenitor cells (ENSPC) can be isolated from ganglionic HSCR gut which then differentiate into enteric neurons and glia in vitro. Most importantly, these ENSPC form clusters of cells known as neurospheres which when implanted into ex vivo aganglionic mouse gut, restore normal patterns of contractility. More recently and quite surprisingly, ENSPC have also been obtained from aganglionic HSCR gut and behave similarly to ganglionic ENSPC in vitro. The aim of this thesis is to add understanding to this finding by determining the source of ENSPC in aganglionic HSCR gut. The first results chapter focuses on the optimum medium which {{should be used to}} culture neurospheres. It was found that a horse serum based medium promotes the formation of neurospheres under adherent conditions more effectively than a more complex medium containing various growth factors. The next section tests the hypothesis that ENSPC are located within thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in aganglionic gut. Using samples of aganglionic HSCR gut from patients with all variants of HSCR it was possible to correlate the presence of thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> and the ability to obtain ENSPC as aganglionic gut from total colonic and total intestinal HSCR doesn’t contain thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks.</b> It was found that {{it was not possible to}} obtain ENSPC from aganglionic HSCR gut where thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> were absent. This suggests that ENSPC are associated with the thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in aganglionic gut. Subsequently, experiments were aimed at determining whether aganglionic ENSPC are of neural crest lineage. Fluorescence activated cell sorting was used to obtain a sub-population of P 75 positive neural crest derived cells from freshly dissociated aganglionic HSCR gut. After 6 days in culture these cells differentiated into neurons whereas this was not the case in the P 75 negative sub-population. Finally immunohistochemistry was used to look at the structure of thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks</b> in aganglionic gut and the expression of P 75 is correlated to the possible cellular sources of aganglionic ENSPC. When combined, work in this thesis narrows down the possibilities of the cellular origin of ENSPC of which the most likely source is cells of Schwann cell lineage located within thickened <b>nerve</b> <b>trunks.</b> These findings direct further work and make the potential of in vivo ENSPC stimulation and a medical treatment for HSCR more possible...|$|R

50|$|The above account {{deals with}} the {{response}} of a single nerve fiber. If a <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk</b> is stimulated, then as the exciting stimulus is progressively increased above threshold, {{a larger number of}} fibers respond. The minimal effective (i.e., threshold) stimulus is adequate only for fibers of high excitability, but a stronger stimulus excites all the nerve fibers. Increasing the stimulus further does increase the response of whole nerve.|$|E
50|$|The cell {{bodies of}} the {{cochlear}} nerve lie within the cochlea and collectively form the spiral ganglion, named for the spiral shape it shares with the cochlea. These central axons exit the cochlea at its base and form a <b>nerve</b> <b>trunk,</b> which, in humans, is approximately one inch long. This travels in parallel with the vestibular nerves through the internal auditory canal, through which it connects to the brainstem.
