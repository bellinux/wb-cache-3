5|$|In K. guimarotae, the {{two halves}} of the dentary diverge from each other at an angle of 20° near the front, then 40° <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> It also bears two convexities {{on the bottom of the}} jaw, one at the third and fourth teeth and another at the eighth to tenth teeth. The latter {{convexity}} is replaced by a concavity in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the top margin of the jaw behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. <b>Near</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. On the interior of the jaw, the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the symphysis in both species, and the top of the bone bears a low and roughened crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E

5|$|The M21 had a {{different}} layout from the early M4 and M4A1 MMC, {{as it was the}} replacement of the M4. The major difference, was that the M21 and the M4 were based on different half-tracks (the M4 was based on the M2 Half-track while the M21 was based on the M3 Half-track). The major difference was the location and direction of the mortar (the M4's mortar was rear-facing and was <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> while the M21's mortar was front-facing and was closer to the front).|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} few {{noteworthy}} performances in later-season single-day races. Sánchez held the Clásica de San Sebastián {{as a target}} for his season, hoping {{to be the first}} Euskaltel-Euskadi rider to win the race. Sánchez rode {{at the front of the}} race most of the day, until the winner Philippe Gilbert made his signature solo attack to earn victory. Sánchez finished <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the chase pack 14 seconds down the road, for eighth place on the day. Izagirre just missed the podium at the Prueba Villafranca de Ordizia, finishing fourth in a five-man escape that decided the race. Near the end of the season, the team did obtain a podium finish. Trainee rider Peio Bilbao finished second in October's Tour de Vendée. He was just edged out by 's Marco Marcato in a five-man sprint finish. Only 14 riders officially completed this race due to race organizers strictly enforcing the time cut.|$|E
5|$|The temple's inner {{chambers}} {{centered on}} the sanctuary of the temple's primary god, which typically lay along the axis <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the temple building, and in pyramid temples directly against the pyramid base. The sanctuary {{was the focus of}} temple ritual, the place where the divine presence manifested most strongly. The form in which it manifested itself varied. In Aten temples and traditional solar shrines, the object of ritual was the sun itself or a benben stone representing the sun, worshipped in a court open to the sky. In many mortuary temples, the inner areas contained statues of the deceased pharaoh, or a false door where his ba was believed to appear to receive offerings.|$|E

5|$|To {{insulate}} {{the sacred}} {{power in the}} sanctuary from the impurities of the outside world, the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them. People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues. The only exception was during festival processions, when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine. People did have less direct means of interaction. The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer, from doorways to freestanding chapels <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the temple building. Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use, and some families had shrines inside their homes. Despite the gulf that separated humanity from the divine, the Egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to approach their gods.|$|E
5|$|Within Stereospondyli, Yates and Warren erected {{two major}} clades: Capitosauria and Trematosauria. Capitosaurs include large semiaquatic temnospondyls like Mastodonsaurus with flat heads and eyes <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the skull. Trematosaurs include a {{diversity}} of temnospondyls, including large marine trematosauroids, aquatic plagiosaurs, brachyopoids that survived into the Cretaceous, and metoposauroids with eyes {{near the front of}} their heads. In 2000, paleontologists Rainer Schoch and Andrew Milner named a third major clade of stereospondyls, the Rhytidostea. This group included more primitive stereospondyls that could not be placed in either Capitosauria or Trematosauria, and included groups like Lydekkerinidae, Rhytidosteidae, and Brachyopoidea. While Capitosauria and Trematosauria are still widely used, Rhytidostea is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses. Rhytidosteids and brachyopoids are now grouped with trematosaurians, but lydekkerinids are still considered to be a primitive family of stereospondyls.|$|E

The spicule, a spikelike structure that functions in reproduction, is curved at the tip and hardened and has a length of 380 to 426 (406) μm. It is smaller than that of the similar A.tamiasstriati from North American chipmunks and larger than that of A.murissylvatici from various North American and European small rodents, but about as long as that of A.putorii, which however lacks the curved tip.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of November 2, 2002, a female {{employee}} of the Camp Courtney officers' club on Okinawa drove up to the Courtney main gate and reported to base security personnel that a Marine Corps major had just attempted to sexually assault her in her car on a deserted road <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> gate of the base. She identified the Marine as Major Michael Brown and stated that during the assault the major threw her mobile phone into the nearby Tengan River. The woman, later identified with the initials V.N., who was 40 years old, and originally from the Philippines, had lived in Okinawa for 17 years, and was married to a Japanese citizen of Okinawan descent. She reported that she had picked up Brown in her car about 1:30a.m. after the officers' club closed and that he directed her to the deserted road behind the base and after parking, Brown tried to rape her and then threw her mobile phone into the river when she tried to call the police. The Camp Courtney security personnel called the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA). Japanese officers came and took V. N.'s report.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater.

The living colugos lack such a strong postmetacristid. The hypoconulid is <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> lingual margin of the tooth, behind the entoconid. In D.major, this cusp is further to the back than in both D.chimaera and the Sunda colugo, while the two cusps are merged in the Philippine colugo. In D.chimaera, a low crest, the post-hypoconulid cristid, reaches from the hypoconulid to the back lingual corner of the tooth, where a small cuspule, the distocuspid, is located. A long crest, the postcristid, connects the distocuspid to the hypoconid along the posterior side of the tooth. The Philippine colugo is similar, but in D.major, both the distocuspid and the post-hypoconulid cristid are absent, and the Sunda colugo has a weaker distocuspid and a postcristid that does not reach further lingually than the hypoconulid.|$|E
