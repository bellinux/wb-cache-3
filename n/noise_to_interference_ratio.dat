Such error controlled reception converts wireless channels into erasure channels, upon which forward error correction or retransmission is concatenated to achieve reliable communication. Assuming only channel distribution information at the transmitter, we derive the optimal SINR threshold given the transmit power constraint. We show, in the low transmit power regime, the optimal ratio between the SINR threshold and the transmit power is determined only by the channel distributions. I...|$|R

Recent work has proposed using array signal processing techniques of adaptive beamforming, adaptive filtering, and subspace projection <b>to</b> remove <b>interference</b> prior <b>to</b> image synthesis. In some practical scenarios, we have found poor cancellation performance when using such methods. Because signal-of-interest levels in radio astronomy (RA) are usually well below the <b>noise,</b> even <b>interference</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> <b>ratios</b> (INR) less than unity can affect signal estimation.
