40|$|We {{propose a}} {{merchant}} mechanism to expand electricity transmission based on long-term financial transmission rights (FTRs).

We then develop a bi-level programming model for allocation of long-term FTRs according to this rule and apply it to different network topologies. We find that simultaneous feasibility for a transmission expansion project crucially depends on the investor-preference and the proxy-preference parameters. Likewise, for a given amount of pre-existing FTRs the larger the current capacity the greater the need to reserve some FTRs for possible negative externalities generated by the expansion changes...|$|E

40|$|Cosmic {{superstrings}} {{of string}} theory differ from conventional cosmic strings of field theory. We review how {{the physical and}} cosmological properties of the macroscopic string loops influence experimental searches for these relics from the epoch of inflation. The universe's average density of cosmic superstrings can easily exceed that of conventional cosmic strings having the same tension by two or more orders of magnitude. The cosmological behavior of the remnant superstring loops is qualitatively distinct because the string tension is exponentially smaller than the string scale in flux compactifications in string theory. Low tension superstring loops live longer, experience less recoil (rocket effect from the emission of gravitational radiation) and tend to cluster like dark matter in galaxies. Clustering enhances the string loop density {{with respect to the}} cosmological average in collapsed structures in the universe. The enhancement at the Sun's position is ∼ 10 ^ 5. We develop a model encapsulating the leading order string theory effects, the current understanding of the string <b>network</b> <b>loop</b> production and the influence of cosmological structure formation suitable for forecasting the detection of superstring loops via optical microlensing, gravitational wave bursts and fast radio bursts.

40|$|Hysteresis loops were {{observed}} in 99. 999 % pure copper single crystals under unidirectional cyclic stressing using a capacitance gage microstrain measuring technique. These loops; which represent an energy loss presumably due to dislocation damping; were measured at low frequencies {{as a function of}} stress amplitude; prestrain, and temperature. The prestrain region extended from 10 - 6 in/in to 10 - 2 in/in, and the temperature range covered was 135 °K to 300 °K. The decrement, or energy loss per total energy input, was found to decrease markedly with prestrain. For prestrains greater than 1 % only small decrements (less than 0. 03) could be observed below stress amplitudes of 250 psi. No temperature dependence of the decrement was noted in the temperature range concerned. The microyield point, or the stress level at which an open hysteresis loop was first observed, was found to increase with prestrain, but was also temperature independent. Room temperature stress-strain curves indicated a work-hardening effect at strains less than 1 %. Experimental checks revealed that the crystals tested exhibited only a limited easy glide region. The early onset of Stage II hardening is explained as a specimen size effect. The microyield point is associated with the stress necessary to operate a Frank-Read source. The prestrain dependence of the decrement and of the stress to create an open loop are thought to be due to the shortening of the average dislocation <b>network</b> <b>loop</b> length in the Stage II region.

40|$|Abstract: The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) has {{implemented}} an Incentive- Based Regulation (IBR) {{scheme that}} either rewards or penalizes distributors on the System- Average Interruption-Duration Index (SAIDI) and other network performance indices [1]. The optimal placement of automatic reclosers (auto-reclosers) {{is seen as}} a cost-effective measure to reduce the system-average interruption-duration index (SAIDI) impact along a medium voltage (MV) feeder. An auto-recloser {{is seen as a}} function of distribution automation (DA), thus reducing customer impact. A great advantage of a correctly implemented and operated DA system can improve network reliability significantly. This dissertation evaluates the empirical relationship between recloser placement and reliability from the perspective of control and instrumentation within ESKOM. It also puts forward an additional performance-improvement framework that can be implemented to achieve RAM (Reliability, Availability and Maintainability) management. Loop automation functionality is also under discussion; this is a Distribution-System Automation-scheme that restores the supply to the fault-free sections of a network, if they have been disconnected, because of a fault in another section of the <b>network.</b> <b>Loop</b> automation can also restore the normal network configuration automatically, when the faulty section is repaired.

This method is more suitable for an uprating solution of power systems, because the ACCC conductors have advantages like high current capacity, long-term reliability, low sag-tension property, easy and quick installation, and low line loss.
