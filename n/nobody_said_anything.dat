60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything.</b> We {{all just}} stood {{and looked at}} the captain. Tears began to come into the eyes of Tom Myers and his brother George.|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, they never did {{discover}} what became of the bear; but in the meanwhile <b>nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> further {{for a moment or}} two. Then the major rubbed his leg.|$|E
60|$|Then Carroll came down, and a {{few moments}} later Mrs. Chisholm {{appeared}} and they went in to dinner in a low-ceilinged room. <b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> of importance, but by and by Mabel turned to Vane.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{voice of}} a king is the {{voice of a}} great god,' my mahout murmured, in a solemn whisper. Then <b>nobody</b> else <b>said</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know as well}} as any {{one when}} a person is good-natured. What made him go off in that hoity-toity fashion? <b>Nobody</b> had <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to him." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the next}} two months all went well and merrily. <b>Nobody</b> ever <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> more to me about Cecil Fenwick, but the girls all chattered freely to me of their little love affairs, and I became a sort of general confidant for them. It just warmed up the cockles of my heart, and I began to enjoy the Sewing Circle famously. I got a lot of pretty new dresses and the dearest hat, and I went {{everywhere}} I was asked and had a good time.|$|R
60|$|They {{advanced}} {{in the most}} perfect silence and very slowly. <b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything,</b> and if orders were given {{this must have been}} done by signs. I could not see that any of them had firearms.|$|E
6000|$|She read it, {{handed it}} to Tod, who also read it and {{handed it to}} Felix. <b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything.</b> It was so {{altogether}} simple and friendly a note that Felix felt pleased with it, thinking: 'I expressed that well!' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> further, {{and they}} plodded silently {{into the gloom}} that still {{shrouded}} all the hillside. It was dusk {{when they came back}} again, but they had found no sign of Trooper Probyn, or anything that might account for his disappearance, except an empty 44-cartridge lying not far from his trail.|$|E
2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, {{who does}} not appear on the {{recording}}, noted that the recording foreshadowed his departure from the band, stating: [...] "They did that while I {{was on the road}} touring for my solo record. [...] I knew that that was the ending because nobody told me about it. Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me. That {{was one of the last}} straws for me, because <b>nobody</b> had <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to me, and they recorded a song by one of my favorite bands. It was pretty clear I'm a big Rolling Stones fan, and they recorded the song without me. So I knew that was it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Similarities {{between the}} song and the Doors' 1968 song, [...] "Hello, I Love You" [...] have been pointed out. Ray Davies said on the topic: [...] "My {{publisher}} wanted to sue. I was unwilling to do that. I think they cut a deal somewhere, but I don't know the details." [...] Dave Davies said of this: [...] "That one is the most irritating of all {{of all of them}} ... I did a show where I played [...] "All Day and All of the Night" [...] and stuck in a piece of 'Hello, I Love You.' There was some response, there were a few smiles. But I've never understood why <b>nobody's</b> ever <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> about it. You can't say anything about the Doors. You're not allowed to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--I--should {{not make}} any fuss about it. If she likes to be poor, that is her affair. <b>Nobody</b> would have <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> if she had married the young fellow because he was rich. Plenty of beneficed clergy are poorer than they will be. Here is Elinor," [...] {{continued}} the provoking husband; [...] "she vexed her friends by me: I had hardly a thousand a-year--I was a lout--nobody could see anything in me--my shoes were not the right cut--all the men wondered how a woman could like me. Upon my word, I must take Ladislaw's part until I hear more harm of him." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> for a little. Forel {{had told}} them nothing new, and they could guess at the {{suspense}} Alton had been enduring, for {{the decision of the}} Crown authorities meant a good deal to all of them. If the claim were declared open, the first man to restake it and get in his papers could take possession.|$|E
60|$|The man hesitated, {{and though}} he strolled off toward the stables, Nevis's {{sharpness}} cost him several minutes' unnecessary delay. Eventually the buggy was brought out, and <b>nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> when Nevis got in and flicked the horse smartly with a whip, though the tilt of the seat must have been evident {{to most of the}} lookers-on. Alison touched Thorne's arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything.</b> The embarrassed poor {{creature}} {{stood there}} and appealed to one face after the other with his eyes, and found no welcome in any, the smile on his own face flickering and fading and perishing, meanwhile; then he dropped his gaze, the muscles of his face began to twitch, and he put up his hand to cover this womanish sign of weakness.|$|E
500|$|The MGM moguls {{were careful}} {{to protect their}} {{contract}} big stars from controversy, and Tracy wished to conceal his relationship with Hepburn from his wife, so it was hidden from the public. The couple did not live together until {{the final years of}} Tracy's life, when they shared a cottage on George Cukor's estate in Beverly Hills. In Hollywood, however, the intimate nature of the Tracy-Hepburn partnership was an open secret. Angela Lansbury, who worked with the pair on State of the Union, later said: [...] "We all knew, but <b>nobody</b> ever <b>said</b> <b>anything.</b> In those days it wasn't discussed." [...] Tracy was not someone to express his emotions, but friend Betsy Drake believed he [...] "was utterly dependent upon Hepburn." [...] Tracy's infidelity apparently continued, however, and he is reported to have had an affair with Gene Tierney during the making of Plymouth Adventure in 1952.|$|R
60|$|As matters stood, <b>nobody</b> {{thought or}} <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> upon the subject; so Chuffey {{fell back into}} a dark corner {{on one side of}} the fireplace, where he always spent his evenings, and was neither seen nor heard again that night; save once, when a cup of tea was given him, in which he was seen to soak his bread mechanically. There was no reason to suppose that he went to sleep at these seasons, or that he heard, or saw, or felt, or thought. He remained, as it were, frozen up--if any term {{expressive}} of such a vigorous process can be applied to him--until he was again thawed for the moment by a word or touch from Anthony.|$|R
50|$|Mr Sagar was {{a cotton}} weaver for Ridehalgh & Sons Ltd in Nelson, Lancashire. He claimed that pay had been wrongfully deducted from his wages {{allegedly}} for poor workmanship. His contract was oral, but pay was fixed by collective {{agreement with the}} Amalgamated Weavers' Association and the Cotton Spinners' and Manufacturers' Association. According to the collective agreement {{he should have been}} paid 2l. 5s. 0½d. But Ridehalgh Ltd only paid him 2l. 4s. 0½d., deducting 1s. in respect of a fault in 3 yards of the 80 yards piece. Mr Sagar had failed to piece up a broken thread of the warp. This made 3 yards of cloth unmerchantable. Mr Sagar said this was an unlawful deduction contrary to Truck Act 1831 section 3. But Ridehalgh Ltd argued mills in the locality had the custom of deducting for work that had been performed without reasonable care and skill in the management’s eyes. That had been so for thirty years at the workplace, though <b>nobody</b> had <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> in the oral agreement and no provisions concerning deductions were found in the collective agreement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rot. It's {{been done}} before, and <b>nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything.</b> A chap in Seymour's who left last Easter sold all his stock lines by auction {{on the last}} day of term. They were Virgil mostly and Greek numerals. They sold like hot cakes. There were about five hundred of them altogether. And I happen to know that every word of them has been given up and passed all right." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> {{at all for}} a longtime, {{till the}} Head Chief laughed; then the Stranger-man (who {{was at least a}} Tewara) laughed; then Tegumai laughed till he fell down flat on the bank; then all the Tribe laughed more and worse and louder. The only people who did not laugh were Teshumai Tewindrow and all the Neolithic ladies. They were very polite to all their husbands, and said 'Idiot!' ever so often.|$|E
60|$|About {{half an hour}} later, all {{the members}} of the two {{families}} were again in the drawing-room. But of course <b>nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> about the presents. In any case they were all too busy looking at the beautiful big Bible, with maps in it, that the Joneses had brought to give to Grandfather. They all agreed that, with the help of it, Grandfather could hunt up any place in Palestine in a moment, day or night.|$|E
60|$|Here {{it seemed}} to Little Dorrit that a change came over the Marshalsea spirit of their society, and that Prunes and Prism got the upper hand. Everybody was walking about St Peter's and the Vatican on {{somebody}} else's cork legs, and straining every visible object through somebody else's sieve. <b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> what <b>anything</b> was, but everybody said what the Mrs Generals, Mr Eustace, or somebody else said it was. The whole body of travellers {{seemed to be a}} collection of voluntary human sacrifices, bound hand and foot, and delivered over to Mr Eustace and his attendants, to have the entrails of their intellects arranged according to the taste of that sacred priesthood. Through the rugged remains of temples and tombs and palaces and senate halls and theatres and amphitheatres of ancient days, hosts of tongue-tied and blindfolded moderns were carefully feeling their way, incessantly repeating Prunes and Prism in the endeavour to set their lips according to the received form. Mrs General was in her pure element. Nobody had an opinion. There was a formation of surface going on around her on an amazing scale, and it had not a flaw of courage or honest free speech in it.|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{only did}} one {{complete}} take of the slow version of 'Forever Young,'" [...] recalls Fraboni. [...] "This take was so riveting, {{it was so}} powerful, so immediate, I couldn't get over it. When everyone came in <b>nobody</b> really <b>said</b> <b>anything.</b> I rewound the tape and played it back and everybody listened to it {{from beginning to end}} and then when it was over everybody sort of just wandered out of the room. There was no outward discussion. Everybody just left. There was just friend and I sitting there. I was so overwhelmed I said, 'Let's go for a walk.' We went for a walk and came back and I said, 'Let's go listen to that again.' We were like one minute or two into it, I was so mesmerized by it again I didn't even notice that Bob had come into the room...So when we were assembling the master reel I was getting ready to put that take on the master reel. I didn't even ask. And Bob said, 'What're you doing with that? We're not gonna use that.' And I jumped up and said, 'What do you mean you're not gonna use that? You're crazy! Why?' Well,...during the recording...childhood friend Lou Kemp and this girl came by and she had made a crack to him, 'C'mon, Bob, what! Are you getting mushy in your old age?' It was based on her comment that he wanted to leave version off the record." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the socialist}} {{perspective}} everybody counts {{the same or}} <b>nobody</b> can be <b>said</b> to count <b>anything.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> further, and {{the moving}} figures stopped where the rope {{ran into the}} shadows of the rocks, while it was a few minutes later when a long, dusky object swung out on it. It slid {{somewhat}} slowly down the incline, and then stopped where the slight curve led upward, and remained dangling high above the hidden river. A shout came faintly through the roar of water in the gulf below, and the dark mass oscillated violently, but otherwise remained immovable.|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{as every}} one stared in blank amazement and <b>nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything,</b> I {{found time to}} look about me, marveling at the oddly {{familiar}} appearance of the town. As I looked, the houses, streets, and everything seemed to undergo a sudden and mysterious transposition {{with reference to the}} points of the compass, as if swinging round on a pivot; and like one awakened from a dream I found myself among accustomed scenes. To be plain about it, I was back again in Swan Creek, as right as a trivet! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "While we {{were talking}} there came {{a knock at the}} door. Lendorf put his eye to the keyhole, and made a sign. The police were there. <b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything,</b> but Misek crawled under the bed; we all followed; and the {{knocking}} grew louder and louder. In the wall {{at the back of the}} bed was a little door into an empty cellar. We crept through. There was a trap-door behind some cases, where they used to roll barrels in. We crawled through that into the back street. We went different ways." ...|$|E
6000|$|None {{of these}} {{visitors}} was at ease, but, being honest people, they didn't pretend to be. None {{of them had}} ever seen a person bearing a title of nobility before, and none had been expecting to see one now, consequently the title came upon them as a kind of pile-driving surprise and caught them unprepared. A few tried to rise to the emergency, and got out an awkward [...] "My lord," [...] or [...] "Your lordship," [...] or something of that sort, but the great majority were overwhelmed by the unaccustomed word and its dim and awful associations with gilded courts and stately ceremony and anointed kingship, so they only fumbled through the handshake and passed on, speechless. Now and then, as happens at all receptions everywhere, a more than ordinary friendly soul blocked the procession and kept it waiting while he inquired how the brothers liked the village, and how long they were going to stay, and if their family was well, and dragged in the weather, and hoped it would get cooler soon, and all that sort of thing, so as to be able to say, when he got home, [...] "I had quite a long talk with them"; but <b>nobody</b> did or <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> of a regrettable kind, and so the great affair went through to the end in a creditable and satisfactory fashion.|$|R

6000|$|... "O great king," [...] resumed the minister's son, [...] "at {{the time}} of going away had she <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to you? or had you <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to her?" ...|$|R
60|$|Grasping {{the rail}} with both hands, Appleby saw the gunboat rolling black athwart the moonlight, while {{a smear of}} vapor broadened about her; {{but there was another}} sound beneath him as he gazed, and while the {{splinters}} flew in showers a great rent opened in the deck. <b>Nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything,</b> or could have been heard if he had, and Appleby clung tighter still when once more a sea crested with spouting white came along. It lifted the “Ventura” up, {{and then there was a}} curious quietness as it dropped her clear of the reef. Through the sudden silence Harper’s voice rose evenly and almost expressionless.|$|E
60|$|Grace {{thought her}} arrival had embarrassed the others, because <b>nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> {{for a moment}} or two. Railton sat in an old oak chair by the fire, with a stick near his hand; Tom, the shepherd, {{occupied}} the middle of the floor; and Kit Askew leaned against the table, at which Mrs. Railton and Lucy sat. Grace wished she could see them better, but the blaze had sunk and the fire burned low, giving out an aromatic smell, and throwing dull reflections on the old oak furniture, copper kettles, and tall brass candlesticks. As a rule, the lonely homesteads in the dales are furnished well, with objects made long since and handed down from father to son.|$|E
60|$|It was now holiday-time at the schools, and {{the young}} ladies had gone home, and Miss Monflathers was {{reported}} to be flourishing in London, and damaging the hearts of middle-aged gentlemen, but <b>nobody</b> <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> about Miss Edwards, whether she had gone home, or whether she had any home to go to, whether she was still at the school, or anything about her. But one evening, as Nell was returning from a lonely walk, she happened to pass the inn where the stage-coaches stopped, just as one drove up, and there was the beautiful girl she so well remembered, pressing forward to embrace a young child whom they were helping down from the roof.|$|E
6000|$|TARLETON. Come now, Patsy! {{none of that}} nonsense. Has Mr Percival <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to {{you that}} I ought to know or that Bentley ought to know? Have you <b>said</b> <b>anything</b> to Mr Percival? ...|$|R
