5|$|In the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> Sad Sam Jones, a 22-year veteran in the American League, {{replaced}} Dutch Ruether, who {{had replaced}} pitcher Shawkey. Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow {{had only two}} other home runs in his career, {{both of which were}} inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth. With the bases loaded and two outs {{in the top of the}} <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> Bottomley hit a fly ball to center fielder Earle Combs. The Yankees did not score in the bottom of the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> and lost the game to the Cardinals by a 6–2 score. Alexander pitched a complete game, allowed hits in only two of the nine innings and did not allow a Yankee hit after the third inning. He also had a series-high 10 strikeouts, allowing four hits, one earned run and one walk. Meanwhile, the Yankees' starter Shocker allowed ten hits and five earned runs, including a home run, in seven innings of work. Shawkey had a perfect inning with two strikeouts, while Jones gave up two hits and allowed two walks in the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning.</b>|$|E

5|$|On September 28, 1938, the {{two teams}} met for the second game of the series, where Hartnett {{experienced}} the highlight of his career. With darkness descending on the lightless Wrigley Field and the score tied at 5 runs apiece, the umpires ruled that the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning</b> {{would be the last}} to be played. The entire game would have to be replayed the following day if the score remained tied. Hartnett came to bat with two out {{in the bottom of the}} <b>ninth</b> <b>inning.</b> With a count of 0 balls and 2 strikes, Hartnett connected on a Mace Brown pitch, launching the ball into the darkness, before it eventually landed in the left-center field bleachers. The stadium erupted into pandemonium as players and fans stormed the field to escort Hartnett around the bases. Hartnett's walk-off home run became immortalized as the Homer in the Gloamin'.|$|E
5|$|Greinke {{was called}} up to the major leagues on May 22, 2004, and made his major league debut against the Oakland Athletics, {{allowing}} two runs in five innings.

5|$|Signed as a pinch hitter for the Cleveland Indians at age 19, Paschal {{appeared}} in nine games, collecting one hit on August 16, which broke up a no-hitter by Bernie Boland {{with two outs}} in the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning.</b> The Indians declared Paschal too inexperienced, and {{he was sent to}} the Muskegon Reds of the Central League. The league disbanded {{in the middle of the}} 1917 season, and Paschal became a free agent.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{were leading}} the Yankees 3–0 {{by the end}} of the inning. The Yankees failed to produce any offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead by picking up a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home {{following}} a Jim Bottomley grounder to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak infield groundouts. The Yankees picked up one hit in each of the next two innings, but could not produce any runs. Yankees pitcher Myles Thomas came in to pitch a hitless <b>ninth</b> <b>inning.</b> With one out in the top of the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> Lou Gehrig hit a line drive single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into a double play, ending the game as a 4–0 Cardinals victory. Haines pitched a complete game shutout, and only gave up five hits total, two of which came from Gehrig.|$|E

25|$|Scuderia Toro Rosso were seventh overall, with Russian rookie Daniil Kvyat {{becoming}} the youngest driver to score points in Formula One, having finished <b>ninth</b> <b>in</b> Australia. Jean-Éric Vergne finished eighth in Canada, while Kvyat retired with a mechanical failure. Both drivers retired in Austria: Kvyat {{after suffering a}} rear suspension failure, and Vergne with brake issues. Both drivers recorded points in Britain. Vergne finished <b>ninth</b> <b>in</b> Hungary, while Kvyat missed the points. Kvyat finished <b>ninth</b> <b>in</b> Belgium, while Vergne was outside the points. Vergne recorded the team's best result {{of the season with}} sixth place in Singapore. Vergne took <b>ninth</b> <b>in</b> Japan, while Kvyat qualified a career-best fifth in Russia, but fell down the order with fuel consumption problems. Vergne originally took <b>ninth</b> <b>in</b> the United States, but was demoted to tenth after he incurred a five-second penalty following contact in an incident with Grosjean. Kvyat finished outside the points after taking a ten-place grid penalty for an engine change. Both Toro Rossos finished outside the points in Brazil and Abu Dhabi, bringing a disappointing end to both drivers' careers with the team.|$|R

5|$|In {{the seventh}} inning, the Yankees faced a new pitcher, this time southpaw Bill Hallahan, {{who served as}} both a starter and {{reliever}} for the Cardinals. After Severeid singled and subsequently advanced on a sacrifice bunt by Hoyt, he scored on a double hit into left field by Combs. The Yankees led 10–4 and did not get any more runs or hits in the eighth or <b>ninth</b> <b>inning.</b> The Cardinals came up to bat {{in the bottom of}} the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning</b> with Hoyt trying to hold on to his six-run lead. Hornsby singled to right field and advanced to second base on the following play. He then ran home to score a run on a Les Bell single to center field. Hafey then popped up in foul territory, and Severeid made the catch. The game ended with a 10–5 score. Waite Hoyt pitched a complete game, allowing two earned runs on 14 hits while striking out eight batters. The Cardinals' five pitchers combined to give up 10 Yankee runs and 14 hits. With the series tied at two games apiece, both teams anticipated Game5, which featured a rematch between Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel.|$|E
5|$|On the {{strength}} of his performance for the Bees, Umbricht was promoted to the Pirates roster {{near the end of the}} 1959 season. He appeared in only one game, a 7–6 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. He pitched seven innings, giving up five earned runs while striking out three. Umbricht left the game in position for the win, as the Pirates were leading 6–5, but reliever Don Gross gave up two earned runs in the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning</b> for the blown save and the loss.|$|E
5|$|The Atlanta Braves then visited Philadelphia for {{a four-game}} series. In game one, Hernandez {{started for the}} Phillies and Ervin Santana for the Braves. After a pitchers' duel through seven innings, the Braves hit back-to-back-to-back home runs {{in the top of}} the eighth before the Phillies rallied with five runs in the bottom of the inning (a two-RBI single by Byrd and a three-run home run by Domonic Brown) for a 6–5 lead {{entering}} the ninth. Since Papelbon had pitched in the previous three games, he was unavailable as a closer. Jake Diekman pitched the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> allowing a grand slam by Dan Uggla for a final score of 9–6. Jackie Robinson Day, scheduled to be celebrated by the Phillies and Braves on April 15, was postponed to the following day when the game was rained out. On April 16 Lee pitched nine innings, striking out 13 batters and giving up one run for a 1–0 loss. In the series' last game, Burnett pitched seven shutout innings in a scoreless game before Ben Revere hit an RBI single in the eighth; Papelbon pitched a scoreless <b>ninth</b> <b>inning</b> for the save in the 1–0 win. The Phillies finished the home stand with a 4–5 record.|$|E

5|$|The Cardinals {{came back}} {{to take the lead}} in the bottom of the seventh inning. Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey fly out, O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from second base to home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2–1 advantage. In the top of the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, {{advancing}} Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third base to make the force out on Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second base to get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to second base, ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals could not break the 2–2 tie in the bottom of the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> so the game went into extra innings.|$|E
5|$|The New York Mets {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} {{with a record of}} 100–60 while the Dodgers had a 94–67 record. The Mets had won ten of the eleven head-to-head regular season contests and were the favorite in the series. On October 4, 1988, Hershiser posted eight scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1988 NL Championship Series (bringing his unofficial total of consecutive scoreless innings to 67) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning. In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the third out recorded on infield grounders to Hershiser. In the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning,</b> Gregg Jefferies led off with a single on a sinker down the middle and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with Keith Hernandez. Jefferies, a rookie, recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser. With Jefferies on second, Darryl Strawberry posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in the strike zone. Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball. After Hershiser gave up a run in the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning</b> 100 pitches into his performance, pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signaling for a double switch before getting to the mound to talk to Hershiser. The Dodgers' bullpen had led the league in saves that year. Howell had recorded 18 consecutive scoreless innings in relief. Howell's scoreless streak was longer in calendar days, his last runs allowed occurring on August 11. It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser. Controversially, Mets pitcher David Cone attributed Hershiser's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning.</b> The Mets went on to add two more runs on Gary Carter's shallow fly ball that center fielder John Shelby could not secure until it first hit the ground. The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch, yielding the tying and winning runs. Despite the results, Hershiser's scoreless inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings, as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason.|$|E
5|$|While {{with the}} Senators, Bordagaray raced a horse in a 100-yard dash, losing {{by a few}} feet. During a game, Bordagaray {{reportedly}} went to use the toilet during the <b>ninth</b> <b>inning.</b> While he was off the field, the pitcher threw the ball, unaware he had no right fielder. The batter hit the pitch to right field, leading to a double. Manager Earl McNeely did not criticize Bordagaray, rather telling the pitcher {{to make sure his}} fielders were in place before throwing.|$|E
