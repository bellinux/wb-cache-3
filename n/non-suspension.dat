40|$|A {{variety of}} gas-solids flows can be {{observed}} in the pipeline of a pneumatic conveying system. These flows may be classified as one of three modes: i. suspension flow; ii. <b>non-suspension</b> moving-bed type flow; iii. <b>non-suspension</b> plug type flow. The modes of flow that a bulk material can achieve are dependent upon its particle and bulk properties as well as the pipeline conditions. This work describes the development of mathematical models for these modes of flow as well as experimental investigations to determine the validity of the models proposed. The modelling technique was based upon the solution of the conservation equations for inter-dispersed continua. Mathematical models for phenomena, such as the aerodynamic drag force between the conveying gas and particles, were added to the general mathematical model so that the flow of the gas-solids mixture could be simulated. This resulted in successful development of models for the prediction of suspension flow and <b>non-suspension</b> moving-bed type flow. In addition to providing data for validation of the mathematical models, the experimental programme produced a number of other observations. For example, {{it was found that the}} solids velocity in <b>non-suspension</b> moving-bed type flow could be determined non-intrusively by pressure measurements due to the variation in height of the moving-bed with time at a fixed location.

40|$|Fluidized dense-phase {{pneumatic}} conveying of powders {{is becoming increasingly}} popular in various industries, such as power, chemical, cement, refinery, alumina, pharmaceutical, limestone, to list a few, due to the reasons of reduced gas flows and power consumption, improved product quality control, reduced pipeline sizing and wear rate, increased workplace safety etc. An accurate estimation of total pipeline pressure drop {{is of paramount importance}} for the reliable design of a {{pneumatic conveying}} system. However, because of the highly concentrated and turbulent nature of the gas-solids mixture, fundamentally understanding the flow mechanism and accurately predicting the pressure drop as an important design parameter has only made limited progress so far. This paper results from an ongoing investigation into developing a validated modeling procedure for solids friction factor for the accurate prediction of pressure drop and optimal operating conditions for fluidized dense-phase pneumatic conveying systems. Under the present study, a two-layer based model has been developed by separately considering the solids friction contributions of the <b>non-suspension</b> (dense) bed of powders flowing along the bottom of pipe and the suspension (dilute-phase flow) of particles occurring on top of the <b>non-suspension</b> layer.

40|$|This article {{presents}} results from {{an investigation into}} the modeling of solids friction factor for fluidized dense-phase pneumatic conveying of powders. A fundamental design approach was pursued by employing “straight pipe” and “back calculation” techniques for modeling and using two types of power function formats. The “straight pipe” models were found to be unexpectedly different depending on the selected location of pressure-measuring tapping points (even for the same product). An attempt to explain this variation by studying the “straight pipe” conveying characteristics suggested significant changes in flow mechanisms along the pipe. The derived models were evaluated for scaleup accuracy and stability by predicting for larger and longer pipes. The results showed significant variations in predictions. One format of power function model was found to result in more stable predictions than the other. Possible explanations for the causes of such variations are provided. Physical observations of the flow phenomena of dense-phase conveying for different powders showed the products were mostly conveyed as a dense <b>non-suspension</b> liquid-type-layer along the bottom of the pipe. This mechanism {{does not seem to be}} correctly represented by the existing design approach of using a Froude number term in the solids friction factor models, thus initiating a search for suitable alternative dimensionless grouping(s) that can adequately represent the <b>non-suspension</b> flow phenomena.

40|$|Although {{wheelchair}} {{users are}} regularly subjected to whole-body vibrations {{little research has}} been conducted to assess these vibrations or attempt to reduce them [2, 3, 5]. Most of the wheelchair and whole-body vibration research done to this point has been conducted on manual wheelchairs. Van Sickle et al showed that manual wheelchair propulsion over a simulated road course produces vibration loads that exceed the ISO 2631 - 1 standards for the fatigue-decreased proficiency boundary at the seat of the wheelchair as well {{as the head of the}} user [6]. In a study by Boninger et al [1], 66 % of wheelchair users reported neck pain since acquiring their wheelchair. One of the key reasons believed to be the cause of pain, was the exposure to whole-body vibration. Kwarciak et al [4] and Wolf et al [7] performed similar studies using two methods of analysis to evaluate vibrations on suspension and <b>non-suspension</b> wheelchairs while descending curbs of varying heights. Both studies revealed no significant difference in the abilities of the wheelchairs to reduce the amounts of vibrations transferred to the wheelchair user. Although the efforts of wheelchair companies to reduce the amounts of whole-body vibration transmitted to wheelchair users through the addition of suspension systems is encouraging, the technology is not yet ideal. Additionally, the research to date has focused on manual wheelchairs exclusively, while little attention has been shown to powered wheelchairs. Methods This study includes the use of two suspension electric powered wheelchairs: The Quickie S- 626 and the Invacare 3 G Torque SP Storm Series. Each subject tested all of the configurations of the suspension wheelchairs. These included the Invacare with suspension, the Quickie with suspension set to three settings (most stiff, least stiff, and 50 % stiffness), and both wheelchairs with solid inserts to act as <b>non-suspension</b> wheelchairs.

Vibrations were collected from a tri-axial accelerometer attached to a seat plate beneath the cushion during driving over the activities course. A mixed model ANOVA was used to determine if there were differences between suspensions based on Vibration Dose Value (VDV). Results Statistical analyses of the VDV data revealed significant differences between the six different suspensions over each of the obstacles in the activities of daily living course.

40|$|The two-layer concept {{developed}} previously for a liquid–solids flow {{has been}} adapted to model dense phase transport of powders in pneumatic conveying systems. Many bulk materials {{of this type}} are capable of flowing in a <b>non-suspension</b> moving-bed type of flow. A new model {{for this type of}} flow in a horizontal pipe has been developed where the flow is modelled as two layers: a dilute gas–solids mixture flowing above a dense gas–solids mixture. For each layer, the conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy were solved for both the gas and solids phases. In addition, mass, momentum and energy transfers between the two layers were modelled. A single pressure was shared between the two layers. The paper describes the sub-models used to describe phenomena, such as the momentum transfer between the gas and solids in a layer. Transfer of mass, momentum and energy between the two layers results in a model that behaves in a similar manner to experimental observations. For example, as the mean flow velocity increases, the depth of the dense layer decreases. The predicted pressure profile for fully developed flow was compared with experimental data. In general, the prediction of pressure profile, and the predicted depth of the dense layer show reasonable agreement with the experimental observations. A parametric study was conducted to assess the relative significance of the initial conditions on the overall behaviour of the model. Variation of the initial conditions for the same total gas and solids mass flow rates was found to have only a small effect on the prediction of fully developed flow...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the course}} of daily activities, {{wheelchair}} users are subjected {{to a variety of}} whole-body vibrations that are suspected to cause rider discomfort and a number of harmful physiological effects. In efforts to improve comfort and prevent secondary injuries, manufacturers of manual wheelchairs have integrated suspension systems into their designs. The purpose of this research was to provide a thorough evaluation of currently available suspension manual wheelchairs and to determine the advantages, if any, of wheelchair suspension. The evaluation was composed of two sections: 1) a durability and cost analysis of three selected suspension manual wheelchairs; and 2) a pair of functional tests comparing suspension manual wheelchairs to standard folding- and rigid-frame models. The durability and cost analysis revealed that integrated suspension did not significantly improve wheelchair fatigue life; in fact, in some cases, the modifications reduced wheelchair integrity. In addition, their increased expense considerably lowered their value in relation to the other types of wheelchairs. Altogether, little evidence was found to suggest that suspension manual wheelchairs provide advantages in terms of durability or value over <b>non-suspension,</b> folding-frame wheelchairs. The second section evaluated the ability of suspension manual wheelchairs to reduce the transmission of vibrations to the rider during various height curb descents and while traversing a level, uneven surface. In addition, impact force was measured during curb descent trials and used in the comparison. The results suggest that while the suspension manual wheelchairs provided significant (p =. 0002) reduction in seat accelerations over both types of standard wheelchairs, this was due to the superiority of one wheelchair, the Sunrise Medical Quickie XTR. Furthermore, few significant improvements were found in terms of impact force and vibration dose value, which was calculated from seat accelerations measured during uneven surface testing. Overall the results indicate that suspension manual wheelchairs are not suited to suppress the shock vibrations or repeated low-level vibrations transmitted by curb descents and uneven terrain, respectively. The results of this research should be used to develop a more adequate wheelchair suspension system, and more importantly, should be considered by clinicians and wheelchair users when selecting a wheelchair for everyday use...|$|E

Each subject tested all of the configurations of the suspension wheelchairs and solid inserts to represent a <b>non-suspension</b> wheelchair. In each of the configurations of the wheelchairs, the subjects traversed an Activities of Daily Living (ADL) course. Vibrations were collected from a tri-axial accelerometer mounted to a ¼ inch aluminum seat plate during driving over the activities course. Root Mean Square Values and Vibration Dose Values were analyzedStatistical analyses of the RMS and VDV data revealed significant differences between the six different suspensions over each of the obstacles in the activities of daily living course. Post-hoc analyses revealed that for each of the obstacles, significant differences existed between the Invacare suspension and the Invacare solid insert. For the Quickie power wheelchair the solid insert setting was not significantly different from the most-stiff setting for each of the obstacles except the smooth surface. The solid insert setting was significantly different than the lowest and mid stiffness settings for all of the obstacles except the smooth surface and the deck surface. Without significant periods of rest the effects of WBV are cumulative throughout the course of the day, and the longer the exposure time the lower the threshold of non-harmful vibrations. Although most of the suspension systems are capable of reducing the amounts of vibration transmitted to the users the results of the vibration dose values seem to indicate that they may not reduce them enough to reduce probability of injury in powered wheelchair users. Future work should move towards examining these vibrations to evaluate what actual levels of WBV wheelchair users are experiencing over the course of an entire day and examining relationships between suspension and user weight to make data available to clinicians and wheelchair companies for suspension tuning...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Determining the {{operating}} parameters and design considerations for dense phase (<b>non-suspension)</b> conveying of fine powders in pneumatic systems typically use empirical, steady-state modelling techniques, as {{the mechanisms of}} the flow behaviour are still not fully understood. However, this necessary simplification in the modelling of the dense phase flow still presents significant challenges in ensuring that the predicted outcomes adequately reflect the physical nature of the flow, and therefore provide good design guidance. This thesis represents an examination and development of techniques required for designing dense phase systems of fine powders in three specific areas; prediction of a materials potential to dense phase convey, solids friction correlations and their subsequent effect on pressure drop prediction, and modelling the solids flow from a local perspective. The dense phase capability analysis was conducted by reviewing the current predictive techniques utilising known dense phase material data. It was apparent in the thesis that there were distinct strong predictive regions in all the diagrams; however some diagrams showed areas with weak predictive regions. This work also illustrated the difficulties in comparing different de-aeration rate techniques and significantly, a new mode of flow predictive chart was developed which eliminated the need to determine de-aeration rates while still maintaining distinctly strong dense phase predictive capability. Solids friction based pressure models invariably use a power law which require determination of co-efficient/s and exponent/s. Detailed in this thesis is the research which shows why solutions do not always occur in these power law based friction models and defines a method of determining stable and meaningful values for the exponents. Furthermore, a generic air/particle parameter based solids friction model was developed which is a clear advancement in defining the frictional resistance of dense phase pneumatic conveying of powder. This thesis also proposes a new continuum model which calculates the force balance between the conveying air flow, {{the resistance of the}} particles and geometrical effects, like bends. The solution to this model provides qualitative information on fine powder dense phase flow velocity from a solids flow perspective and represents a major step in advancing dense phase modelling from a particle flow basis...|$|E
40|$|Many bio-pharmaceutical {{production}} processes {{are based upon}} the use of mammalian cell lines, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, capable of proliferation as single cells in suspension in a synthetic environment. Routine use of CHO cells as production vehicles requires a lengthy “adaptation” process from the wild-type adherent clone to clones capable of proliferation in a suspension environment depleted of exogenous growth factors and cell-matrix contacts. Different approaches have been applied in this study {{to gain a better}} understanding of the changes on the cell surface occurring as a response to changes in their environment, comparing four cell lines (CCL 61, AML, S cells and CHO-S) adapted to suspension or adherence growth condition. Biochemistry and mass spectrometry methods showed differences in surface protein composition for the cell lines. The comparison of the expression of cell-to-cell adhesion molecules revealed a highly variable bimodal distribution on S cells which was not seen on CCL 61. Analysis of the expression level of integrins, the main interaction partner of serum components, indicated that integrin expression is not generally down-regulated on suspension-adapted CHO cells. The integrin conformation on the cell surface, analysed by confocal microscopy, revealed a specific conformation, especially with regard to integrin beta 1, characterised by an even, net-like distribution of integrin clusters over the surface of the cells. This specific integrin conformation, which has only been found on suspension-adapted cells, was underlined by a sub-cortical sheet of actin, forming a ball-like structure directly under the cell membrane; this actin conformation required re-organisation of the actin cytoskeleton from a typical fibrillar morphology in adherent cells. The actin content was higher in suspension cell lines compared to adherent cells, but actin up-regulation was also found in <b>non-suspension</b> adapted cells after they had been transferred into suspension [...] Sphere-like integrin beta 1 clustering on CCL 61 grown in suspension could be induced by treatment with cytochalasin D, followed by suspension culture without the drug, however, despite the change in integrin beta 1 conformation these cells could not grow in suspension. The data suggests that adaptation to suspension growth requires conservation of integrins, presumably with respect to their role as structural elements anchoring the plasma membrane to the sub-cortical actin sheath, but it also requires additional changes in the interplay between integrin beta 1 and actin, for example, changes in the regulation of the associated proteins for successful suspension adaptation of CHO cells...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown that robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is feasible, with {{favorable}} complication rates and short hospital times. However, the early recovery of urinary continence remains a challenge to be overcome. Objective: We describe our technique of periurethral retropubic suspension stitch during RALP and report its impact on early recovery of urinary continence. Design, setting, and participants: We analyze prospectively 331 consecutive patients who underwent RALP, 94 without the placement of suspension stitch (group 1) and 237 with the application of the suspension stitch (group 2). Surgical procedure: The only difference between the groups was the placement of the puboperiurethral stitch after the ligation of the dorsal venous complex (DVC). The periurethral retropubic stitch was placed using a 12 -in monofilament polyglytone suture on a CTI needle. The stitch was passed from right to left between the urethra and DVC, and then through the periostium on the pubic bone. The stitch was passed again through the DVC, and then through the pubic bone in a figure eight, and then tied. Measurements: Continence rates were assessed with a self-administered validated questionnaire (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] at 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo after the procedure. Continence was defined as the use of no absorbent pads or no leakage of urine. Results and limitations: In group 1, the continence rate at 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo postoperatively was 33 %, 83 %, 94. 7 %, and 95. 7 %, respectively; in group 2, the continence rate was 40 %, 92. 8 %, 97. 9 %, and 97. 9 %, respectively. The suspension technique resulted in significantly greater continence rates at 3 mo after RALP (p = 0. 013). The median/mean interval to recovery of continence was also statistically significantly shorter in the suspension group (median: 6 wk; mean: 7. 338 wk: 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 6. 387 - 8. 288) compared to the <b>non-suspension</b> group (median: 7 wk; mean: 9. 585 wk: 95 % CI: 7. 558 - 11. 612; log rank test, p = 0. 02). Conclusions: The suspension stitch during RALP resulted in a statistically significantly shorter interval to recovery of continence and higher continence rates at 3 mo after the procedure.

40|$|Dense-phase {{pneumatic}} conveying of powders {{is becoming increasingly}} popular in various industries such as power, pharmaceutical, cement, alumina, chemical, limestone, refinery, and so on. Some of the reasons include: minimum gas flows and power consumption; improved product quality; increased workplace safety. However, due to the highly concentrated and turbulent mode of the solids-gas flow, only limited progress has been be achieved so far in understanding the fundamental transport mechanisms and accurately predicting pipeline pressure drop, which is a key system design parameter. This thesis aims to overcome the present limitations and provide the industry with a new validated modelling procedure for the accurate prediction and scale-up of pressure drop and optimal operating conditions for fluidised dense-phase {{pneumatic conveying}} systems. Various popular/existing models (and model formats) for solids friction (for straight horizontal pipes) have been evaluated for scale-up accuracy and stability. It {{has been found that}} the models (and their use of parameter groupings) are generally not capable of accurately predicting pressure drop under scale-up conditions of pipeline diameter and/or length. Two new approaches and another method based on the parameters used by other researcher have been employed in this study as improved design techniques. One approach, derived by modifying an existing reliable dilute-phase model to make it suitable for dense-phase, has resulted in a substantial relative improvement in the overall accuracy of predictions under scale-up conditions for two types of fly ash, ESP dust, pulverised coal and fly ash/cement mixture. Another method has been derived using the concept of “two-layer” slurry flow modelling (i. e. suspension flow occurring on top of a <b>non-suspension</b> moving layer), and this has also resulted in similar improvements. The third method, using parameters that were mentioned by another researcher as providing better representation of the flow phenomenon, has also resulted in similar reliable predictions. Three different popular/existing bend models have been evaluated to select an optimal (bend loss) model for dense-phase powder conveying. It has been found that the estimation of bend pressure drop can have a considerable impact towards correctly predicting the total pressure loss in a pneumatic conveying system. An existing method of representing “minimum transport criteria” (based on superficial air velocity and solids loading ratio) has been found inadequate for predicting the unstable boundary, especially under diameter scale-up conditions. Based on the experimental data of various powders conveyed over a wide range of pipe lengths and diameters, it is found that with increase in pipe diameter, the requirement of minimum conveying air velocity increases. To capture the pipe diameter effect, a Froude number based approach has been introduced to reliably represent the minimum transport boundary. The thesis also investigates the suitability of using a direct differential pressure (DP) measurement technique across a straight length of pipe for fine powder conveying in dense-phase. Standard Deviations (SD) of the DP, as well as the static pressure signals are presented. The trend shows the SD values are increasing with increase in pipe length from pipe inlet to exit (i. e. a dependence on tapping location) ...|$|E
