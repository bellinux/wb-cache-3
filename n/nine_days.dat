40|$|This {{experiment}} {{been conducted}} in the Zanjan University’s pilot farm in order to evaluate the yield and yield components of corn and soybean intercropping in deficit irrigation condition. The farm was prepared as split plots in complete randomized blocks with three iteration regimens. Different irrigation intervals {{were used in the}} main plots at three level of every seven <b>day</b> (control), every <b>nine</b> <b>day,</b> and every elven day interval; the cropping pattern was as follow: secondary plots for corn and soya monoculture, while the main plots were used for additive intercropping (100 % corn plus 20 % soy), replacement intercropping with 2 : 2 ratio (50 % corn plus 50 % soy). The greatest corn yield was obtained from every <b>nine</b> <b>day</b> irrigation interval after control group. Moreover, the corn yield was higher in intercropping than monoculture crops. The soybean seeds have not been affected by different irrigation interval and the best yield was obtained from monoculture of soy, while it has not any significant differences with intercropping yield. Intercropping shown superiority on monoculture in this experiment and every <b>nine</b> <b>day</b> irrigation interval was the best deficit irrigation method for grain yield in the intercropping...|$|R

An evaluation on the protein fraction of lighted pasteurizaed milk samples at T= 4 °C {{over a period of}} 9 days of preservation has been carried out to relate this parameter with milk qulality. The collected spectra show no protein degradation until the fourth day shelf-life, while at fifth day of preservation proteolysis became more evident although no evident differences between all kind of materials were found. Nevertheless different protein profiles for each packaging were obtained at eight and <b>nine</b> <b>day</b> shelf-life with the presence of several peaks related to the pronunced proteolysis. Spectra obtained show very complicated patterns in the mass range related to proteose peptones fraction mostly coming from the proteolysis of â-casein.
