25|$|In {{economic}} terms, {{pollution from}} fossil fuels {{is regarded as}} a <b>negative</b> <b>externality.</b> Taxation is considered one way to make societal costs explicit, in order to 'internalize' the cost of pollution. This aims to make fossil fuels more expensive, thereby reducing their use and the amount of pollution associated with them, along with raising the funds necessary to counteract these factors.|$|E
25|$|Much of the time, {{private and}} social costs do not diverge from one another, {{but at times}} social costs may be either greater or less than private costs. When {{marginal}} social costs of production are {{greater than that of}} the private cost function, we see the occurrence of a <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> of production. Productive processes that result in pollution are a textbook example of production that creates negative externalities.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a tax can increase economic efficiency in some cases. If there is a <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> associated with a good, meaning that it has negative effects not felt by the consumer, then a free market will trade {{too much of that}} good. By taxing the good, the government can increase overall welfare as well as raising revenue. This type of tax is called a Pigovian tax, after economist Arthur Pigou.|$|E

40|$|People often {{experience}} {{the benefits of}} taxation over time. We design an intertemporal market experiment with <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> to examine how delaying the benefits of taxation affects support for taxes. We find that when <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> occur immediately, people learn to adopt Pigouvian taxes, which are aimed at reducing <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> and restoring market efficiency. By contrast, when <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> are delayed, people are less receptive to taxation. This effect persists over time. Our data reveal that the strong negative delay effect can be explained {{in large part by}} narrow bracketing and the increased perceived complexity of the environment, rather than by time discounting per-se. We argue and demonstrate that increasing the transparency of intertemporal tradeoffs can effectively promote support for taxation...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{some of the}} conclusions of a larger research project aiming at creating {{a map of the}} decisions on <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> in the regional development and collaborative governing framework. The present regional development models that are focused on the sustainable development (human sustainability, social sustainability, economic sustainability, environmental sustainability) represent the result of the mechanisms quantifying the <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> costs on the local authorities’ level. The <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> represent an assigning criterion based on the subsidiarity principle, especially with regard to the “beggar thy neighbor” policies, namely the environmental pollution, and this provision is in itself a reason for the national economies to act in case of <b>negative</b> <b>externalities.</b> The public decision on covering the <b>negative</b> <b>externalities,</b> taken in accordance with the economic approach of subsidiarity pertaining to the multilevel governance provides a balanced solution for all the interested parties – citizens, economic agents and the government (who are designing a map for covering the social costs raised by the <b>negative</b> <b>externalities,</b> which must be in accordance with both the national and European decisions, but, at the same time, suspending this map whenever it is in conflict with these decisions cannot be an answer, thus leaving the social costs uncovered) ...|$|R
25|$|Free workers also earn {{compensating}} differentials, whereby {{they are}} paid more for doing unpleasant work. Neither sustenance nor enforcement costs rise with the unpleasantness of the work, however, so slaves' costs do not rise by the same amount. As such, slaves are more attractive for unpleasant work, and less for pleasant work. Because the unpleasantness {{of the work is}} not internalised, being born by the slave rather than the owner, it is a <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> and leads to over-use of slaves in these situations.|$|E
25|$|Both Chicken and Hawk–Dove are anti-coordination games, {{in which}} it is {{mutually}} beneficial for the players to play different strategies. In this way, it {{can be thought of as}} the opposite of a coordination game, where playing the same strategy Pareto dominates playing different strategies. The underlying concept is that players use a shared resource. In coordination games, sharing the resource creates a benefit for all: the resource is non-rivalrous, and the shared usage creates positive externalities. In anti-coordination games the resource is rivalrous but non-excludable and sharing comes at a cost (or <b>negative</b> <b>externality).</b>|$|E
25|$|Externalities occur {{where there}} are {{significant}} social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a <b>negative</b> <b>externality,</b> and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities {{in an effort to}} correct the price distortions caused by these externalities. Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply.|$|E

25|$|A {{luxury tax}} applied to goods and {{services}} for conspicuous consumption {{is a type of}} progressive sales tax that at least partially corrects the <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> associated with the conspicuous consumption of positional goods. In Utility from Accumulation (2009), Louis Kaplow said that assets exercise an objective social-utility function, i.e. the rich man and the rich woman hoard material assets, because the hoard, itself, functions as status goods that establish his and her socio-economic position within society. When utility is derived directly from accumulation of assets, this lowers the dead weight loss associated with inheritance taxes and raises the optimal rate of inheritance taxation.|$|E
500|$|Congestion pricing {{is one of}} {{a number}} of {{alternative}} demand side (as opposed to supply side) strategies offered by economists to address traffic congestion. [...] Congestion is considered a <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> by economists. An externality occurs when a transaction causes costs or benefits to a third party, often, although not necessarily, from the use of a public good: for example, if manufacturing or transportation cause air pollution imposing costs on others when making use of public air. [...] Congestion pricing is an efficiency pricing strategy that requires the users to pay more for that public good, thus increasing the welfare gain or net benefit for society.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{positive}} externalities: each firm increases the asset value of unemployment {{for all other}} firms when they hire during recessions. [...] By creating hypercompetitive labor markets, all firms (the winners when laborers compete) experience an increase in value. [...] However, this effect of increased valuation is very unapparent, because the first problem (the <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> of sub-optimal hiring) clearly dominates since the 'natural rate of unemployment' is always too high.|$|E

We show that centralization only weakens political accountability in the presence of <b>negative</b> <b>externalities.</b> Unlike positive <b>externalities,</b> <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> allow federal politicians to extract higher rents. This yields two new insights. First, decentralization can only Pareto dominate centralization in economies with <b>negative</b> <b>externalities.</b> Second, centralization may not be Pareto efficient in economies with positive externalities despite the fact that policy can be tailored to regional taste differences and centralization internalizes the positive externality...|$|R

2500|$|Cultural factors {{affecting}} youth exclusion include reactions to socially constructed categories like race and gender. These classifications can also influence an individual's {{choice to be}} excluded from society. Some academics argue that youth are marginalized because they choose to separate themselves from mainstream society, opting instead to participate in alternative lifestyles and subcultures. Others, however, view this choice as a [...] "forced choice", motivated by the fear of racial, gender {{and other types of}} discrimination. McDonald presents the example of a young black man in the UK who chooses not to go to university because [...] "he fears discrimination as a university student". McDonald says, [...] "This is a <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> imposed by the socially included that is influencing the choice of the young black man in the direction of social exclusion". [...] In this example both structural and cultural barriers influenced this student so he felt excluded from society; he felt pressure from society to remain on the periphery, and in doing so denying himself access to an education. In this situation education failed as an established social structure to provide this individual with inclusion into society.|$|E
2500|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{challenge to}} Jackson and Baird's theory, which more closely resembles actual legal policy, came initially from Elizabeth Warren. Warren argued that Jackson and Baird's model is dangerously oversimplified, {{and based on}} untested hypothetical assertions about behaviour. First, every system of insolvency law must necessarily make choices about how losses are distributed among creditors with multiple interest. Among these diverse interests include weaker creditors, particularly employees, who are less capable than others at diversifying the risks of insolvency. There is a distinct community interest in companies that survive, and no good reason why only creditors with provable proprietary interests in a company's winding up {{should be taken into}} account. This means it is reasonable to give preference to more vulnerable creditors, and to expect secured creditors take on some additional risk to ensure businesses survive for the greater good. The Baird and Jackson view essentially amounts to [...] "single-value economic rationality, an excuse to impose a distributional scheme without justifying it, and, incidentally, a way to work in a damn good deal for secured creditors." [...] Additionally, Lucian Bebchuk has argued that the institution of security interests operates as a partially unjustified <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> against unsecured creditors. It is not clear, argues Bebchuk, that security interests are in fact efficient, and they are capable of subsidising their activities by diverting wealth from unsecured creditors to themselves without any agreement. In the UK, Roy Goode argues that banks usually take security interests, not because they would otherwise charge a higher interest rate (and so increasing credit to businesses for the benefit of all creditors) but because they calculate the market will bear it. The taking of security depends, not on efficiency, but on bargaining power. Riz Mokal, also deeply critical of the creditors' bargain model, suggests that if one were to follow Baird and Jackson's methodology but in a truly value neutral way, one would ask what creditors would hypothetically agree to if they did not know who they were at all (i.e. whether they were voluntary or involuntary creditors, secured or unsecured). This would likely lead to a result where secured credit was not inviolable, and insolvency law could take account of diverse interests, including corporate rescue.|$|E
5000|$|A Pigovian tax (also spelled Pigouvian tax) {{is a tax}} levied on any market {{activity}} that generates <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> (costs not internalized in the market price).

Firstly, the paper presents different theories regarding the internalization of <b>negative</b> <b>externalities.</b> The second part presents the methodology: the author used the method of scientific database search, particularly in the following databases: Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar. The next part is focused on the results of the search. In the Czech Republic, analyses using various qualitative and quantitative methods were found; however, fuzzy modelling has not been used in the internalization of <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> yet. Regarding the foreign studies, there are studies dealing with both the internalization of <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> and fuzzy modelling.

2500|$|While UK {{insolvency}} law fixes a priority regime, and within each class of creditor {{distribution of assets}} is proportional or pari passu, creditors can [...] "jump up" [...] the priority ladder through contracts. A contract for a security interest, which is traditionally conceptualised as creating a proprietary right that is enforceable against third parties, will generally allow the secured creditor to take assets away, free from competing claims of other creditors if the company cannot service its debts. This is the first and foremost function of a security interest: to elevate the creditor's place in the insolvency queue. A second function of security is to allow the creditor to trace the value in an asset through different people, should the property be wrongfully disposed of. Third, security assists independent, out-of-court enforcement for debt repayment (subject to the statutory moratorium on insolvency), and so provides a lever against which the secured lender can push for control's over the company's management. However, given the adverse distributional impact between creditors, the economic effect of secured lending is a <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> against non-adjusting creditors. With an ostensibly private contract between a secured lender and a company, assets that {{would be available to}} other creditors are diminished without their consent and without them being privy to the bargain. Nevertheless, security interests are commonly argued to facilitate the raising of capital and hence economic development, which is argued to indirectly benefits all creditors. UK law has, so far, struck a compromise approach of enforcing all [...] "fixed" [...] or [...] "specific" [...] security interests, but only partially enforcing floating charges that cover a range of assets that a company trades with. The holders of a floating charge take subject to preferential creditors and a [...] "ring fenced fund" [...] for up to a maximum of £600,000 reserved for paying unsecured creditors. The law requires that details of most kinds of security interests are filed on the register of charges kept by Companies House. However this does not include transactions with the same effect of elevating creditors in the priority queue, such as a retention of title clause or a Quistclose trust.|$|E
5000|$|There is an {{important}} conceptual distinction between a demerit good and a <b>negative</b> <b>externality.</b> A <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> occurs when the consumption of a good has measurable negative consequences on others who do not consume the good themselves. [...] Pollution (due, for example, to automobile use) is the canonical example of a <b>negative</b> <b>externality.</b> Another example is cigarettes. It not only affects a deliberate or addicted smoker through damage to health, but also indirect smokers exposed to the smoke (second hand smoking). By contrast, a demerit good is viewed as undesirable because its consumption has negative effects upon the consumer.|$|E
50|$|The sugary drinks tax {{is a way}} {{to correct}} the <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> by {{regulating}} the consumption of sugary drinks. Without a sugar tax, taxpayer money is used to pay for higher health care costs incurred from high consumption of sugar. Although this solution corrects the negative consumption externality, taxpayers that consume sugary drinks moderately and hence do not contribute to higher health care costs, still need to pay for this <b>negative</b> <b>externality.</b> This could be seen as not fair and hence creates an argument for different solutions. Hence a sugary drinks tax may be a more appropriate solution as tax revenue that is collected from the sugar tax can be used to create childhood nutrition programs or obesity-prevention programs. This is a solution that could also correct the <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> of sugar consumption as well as {{is a way to}} make the parties that cause the <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> pay their fair share.|$|E

50|$|Externalities {{show that}} players’ {{benefits}} depend heavily on other players’ commitment decisions. The distance-based utility {{showed that the}} payoffs of players do not just depend on the direct links that they form, {{but also on the}} links that other players have created in the network. Players may confront positive or <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> in networks. The distance-based utility model is an example of positive externalities, since players can only get more benefits when other players increase their number of connections. On the other hand, a model that faces players with <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> is the so-called “Co-Author model” presented by Jackson and Wolinsky in the paper of 1996. Given that working on a research paper requires time and devotion, two researchers can benefit more if are only working with each other at a given period of time and not with many other people. Therefore, in the “Co-Author model” researchers benefit more if their other colleagues have fewer links. In this model, if a player’s neighbors have many links, it will bring <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> to them. In different models, positive or <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> lead to inefficiency.|$|R

50|$|A {{carbon tax}} {{is also an}} {{indirect}} tax—a tax on a transaction—as opposed to a direct tax, which taxes income. A carbon tax is called a price instrument, since it sets a price for carbon dioxide emissions. In economic theory, pollution is considered a <b>negative</b> <b>externality,</b> {{a negative effect on}} a party not directly involved in a transaction, which results in a market failure. To confront parties with the issue, the economist Arthur Pigou proposed taxing the goods (in this case hydrocarbon fuels), which were the source of the <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> (carbon dioxide) so as to accurately reflect the cost of the goods' production to society, thereby internalizing the costs associated with the goods' production. A tax on a <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> is called a Pigovian tax, and should equal the marginal damage costs.|$|E
