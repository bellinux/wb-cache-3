2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2011, colleges were {{required}} by federal law to post a <b>net</b> <b>price</b> calculator on their websites to give prospective students and families a rough estimate of likely college costs for their particular institution, and to [...] "demystify pricing." [...] A student or family could go online, find the calculator at a college's website, and enter the required financial and academic information, and the calculator should tell them {{an estimate of the}} likely cost of attending that college. The first online calculators were started by Williams College. The online calculators look at financial need and academic merit to try to estimate the likely discounted price offered to a particular student from a particular college, using information including details from tax returns, household income, grade point averages and test scores. Schools vary in terms of their pricing formulas; some consider home equity as a factor while others disregard it. Lynn O'Shaughnessy recommends that families shopping for colleges go to a college's website and use the <b>net</b> <b>price</b> calculator to get a personalized estimate of cost.|$|E

Dr. Jane Liu, the Vice President of Data Analysis for Edmunds.com further stated that, [...] "New models are being introduced at higher price points, but the competitiveness of the market is dramatically pushing down net prices, resulting in a record average discount".

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} oil price shocks on the economies of El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, jointly {{referred to as the}} “Borderplex”. It employs a measure of the <b>net</b> oil <b>price</b> increase developed by Hamilton (1996) {{in a manner similar to}} that applied by Sill (2007) to the United States national economy. Impulse response functions are calculated to determine the impact of 10 -percent oil price shocks on the Borderplex regional economy. The asymmetrical relationship between oil prices and economic performance is also examined using a <b>net</b> oil <b>price</b> decrease variable. Results found in this study are inconclusive. Negative and statistically significant relationships for the <b>net</b> oil <b>price</b> increase are obtained in the El Paso real personal income, El Paso non-agricultural employment, Ciudad Juarez retail sales, and Ciudad Juarez formal sector employment equations. Inconsistent results are reported for the El Paso retail sales equation, while there appears to be no relationship between <b>net</b> oil <b>price</b> increases and El Paso gross metropolitan product or between <b>net</b> oil <b>price</b> increases and El Paso median existing single family house prices. The results presented in this study do not find definitive evidence in support of an asymmetrical relationship between oil prices and metropolitan economic performance...|$|R
40|$|Although {{oil price}} shocks {{have long been}} viewed {{as one of the}} leading {{candidates}} for explaining U. S. recessions, surprisingly {{little is known about the}} extent to which oil price shocks explain recessions. We provide a formal analysis of this question with special attention to the possible role of <b>net</b> oil <b>price</b> increases in amplifying the transmission of oil price shocks. We quantify the conditional recessionary effect of oil price shocks in the <b>net</b> oil <b>price</b> increase model for all episodes of <b>net</b> oil <b>price</b> increases since the mid- 1970 s. Compared to the linear model, the cumulative effect of oil price shocks over course of the next two years is much larger in the <b>net</b> oil <b>price</b> increase model. For example, oil price shocks explain a 3 % cumulative reduction in U. S. real GDP in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s and a 5 % cumulative reduction during the financial crisis. An obvious concern is that some of these estimates are an artifact of <b>net</b> oil <b>price</b> increases being correlated with other variables that explain recessions. We show that the explanatory power of oil price shocks largely persists even after augmenting the nonlinear model with a measure of credit supply conditions, of the monetary policy stance and of consumer confidence. There is evidence, however, that the conditional fit of the <b>net</b> oil <b>price</b> increase model is worse on average than the fit of the corresponding linear model, suggesting much smaller cumulative effects of oil price shocks for these episodes of at most 1 %...|$|R

40|$|This paper revisits Williams (1997) on {{the effect}} of <b>net</b> rental <b>price,</b> asset quality and {{variable}} investment costs on the asset redevelopment decision. This paper develops a quasi-analytical method for solving the generalised real renovation option problem by treating the investment cost as having both a variable and a fixed element and then extends the analysis for the case where both the <b>net</b> rental <b>price</b> and asset quality are stochastic. Analysis on the generalised renovation option shows in common with previous real options analyses on investment opportunities that the renovation decision is triggered when the incremental net rental value exceeds the investment cost by a mark-up factor exceeding unity. The solution to the variable cost investment function is derived from the generalised model as a special case. The quasi-analytical method reveals hitherto latent conditions constraining the scope of values the various parameters can take, and in particular that the <b>net</b> rental <b>price</b> volatility limits the range of the risk-free rate. This result holds also when both <b>net</b> rental <b>price</b> and asset quality are stochastic.
