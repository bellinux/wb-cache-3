At this point, the remaining eleven tanks of the Barak Brigade arrived, and Eitan directed them to Ben-Gal. Eitan told Ben-Gal of Ben-Hanan's force. Kahalani called Captain Emi Palant, the senior officer behind the ramps, to use a signal flag to get the tank commanders' attention and direct them to the ramp, but waving the flag got no response. Palant fired his machine gun {{at the side of the}} nearest tank to get the commander to look out, and the message was passed. He ran from tank to tank and rapped on their turrets to get their attention before returning to his own tank and starting to move forward. No tank followed. Kahalani heard a sergeant from the 74th Battalion and ordered him to take his position and guard the wadi. The sergeant replied he did not have any shells left. Zamir, who was flanking his position to the south, reported a massive Syrian attack and asked for permission to move the remaining tanks to Zamir's company to a better position slightly to the south. Ben-Gal refused. Kahalani reported that he was unable to control the tanks, which kept drifting to the rear. Ben-Gal said he would try to get him more tanks. Kahalani ordered the sergeant to take his place, saying the Syrians would not try to attack if they saw his tank.|$|E
500|$|In early 2006, the Seneca Nation {{filed with}} the Securities and Exchange Commission to build the third of the three Western New York casinos that had been legislated in 2002. In 2007, Brown was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> {{was in favor of}} the third casino, which seemed to cater to local {{residents}} instead of luring tourist revenues. Tom Golisano, founder of Paychex, former owner of the Buffalo Sabres National Hockey League franchise and three-time candidate for New York State Governor, suggested that the Buffalo economy would not benefit from a business designed to transfer money from local citizens to the Seneca Gaming Corporation. Brown withheld support while awaiting clarification of the target consumer for the third casino. In October 2006, the Seneca Nation and Brown came to terms on the final sale of a two-block stretch of city road that runs amid the [...] construction site. As part of the sale the nation agreed to both marketing terms (regarding marketing beyond the local region), and hiring preferences for city residents. However, in January 2007, a federal judge ruled that the granting of permission to run the third casino by the National Indian Gaming Commission was improper. Seneca Nation received federal approval for their casino on July 2, 2007 and opened the following day.|$|E
500|$|Peter and Joe visit Quagmire and are {{introduced}} to his father, Lieutenant Commander Dan Quagmire. Expecting to see the inspiration for Quagmire's wanton sexual behavior, they are surprised by Dan's stereotypically gay mannerisms and begin texting each other of how gay Dan is. The following morning, Quagmire invites Peter and Lois to the Naval Ball being held to honor his father, but soon begins arguing with Peter about his father's sexuality. At the ball that night, members of the Navy bombard Quagmire with compliments about his war-hero father, most {{of which can be}} taken as double entendres about Dan's alleged homosexuality. Concerned that his dad may be gay, Quagmire confronts him and Dan states that he is not gay, but is instead [...] "a woman who was born biologically Male" [...] and that he plans to have a sex change operation during his stay in Quahog. At first Peter and Lois conflate gender identity and sexual orientation, then at Lois' suggestion, Peter waits with Quagmire during the operation. The surgery is a success, with Quagmire's dad emerging as the newly named Ida Davis, an attractive blond woman. That night, Ida and Quagmire join the Griffins for dinner. As the dinner begins, however, Quagmire becomes frustrated when the Griffins turn the conversation towards Ida's surgery and other related topics, and storms out of the room. At Quagmire's home, Quagmire tells Ida that he is <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> can deal with her new gender identity. Saddened, Ida leaves Quagmire's home and decides to stay at a nearby Marriott Hotel.|$|E

[...] "Shortly after I sent the book for review", he writes, [...] "a very worried journal editor contacted me. He was upset that I hadn't included a copyright page on the e-book I sent him.

2500|$|The {{character}} of Lofty was written with Mead in mind. Producers created the role after Daniel Anthony's decision to quit {{his role as}} nurse, Jamie Collier. They realised the show would be lacking a young, male nurse and decided to cast Mead. Mead explained {{that they were looking}} for a nurse who [...] "had a big heart and cares for his patients with a unique insight". Show writer Matthew Barry said that having Mead in mind helped the writing team write for Lofty. The show's executive producer Oliver Kent asked Mead's agent if Mead would read for the role and when his agent told him the news, Mead believed he was [...] "joking". At the audition, Mead read for the show's producer and casting directors. He believed that he had delivered what they wanted, but was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "in the frame" [...] for the character.
