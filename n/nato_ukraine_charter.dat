40|$|The article {{investigates the}} non-military {{aspects of the}} {{cooperation}} between Ukraine and the North Atlantic Community at the present stage. The author studies such spheres of the partnership as economy, science, communication. The article emphasizes the fact, that the expansion of functionality of <b>NATO</b> gives <b>Ukraine</b> the favorable possibility to intensify its dialogue with the North Atlantic Alliance on the one hand, and allows to achieve the improvement of image of <b>NATO</b> in <b>Ukraine</b> by the distraction of public opinion from the military aspects of the cooperation on the other hand...|$|R
50|$|While {{not seeking}} to enter <b>NATO,</b> <b>Ukraine</b> is {{committed}} to all NATO deployments and achieving NATO interoperability through development of Rapid Reaction Forces. The EU has been seeking a closer relationship by moving beyond regional cooperation toward gradual economic integration and deepening of political cooperation; however, a strategic EU trade agreement is currently on hold due to selective prosecutions. Ukraine is currently trimming military forces by 30% {{as part of a}} new Strategic Defense Initiative. In 2012, a new Minister of Defense and Chief of Defense were appointed.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. <b>Ukraine's</b> <b>NATO</b> ambitions form a controversial but vital international issue because they implicate the contradictory perspectives of Poland and Russia. The history and self-perceptions {{of all three}} states shape and reshape the question of <b>Ukraine</b> joining <b>NATO,</b> as a key step toward westernization, integration, and independence. The challenges of accommodating these competing visions {{of the past and}} future are relevant beyond the alliance to all practitioners and scholars of international affairs; in this connection, the question of <b>Ukraine's</b> <b>NATO</b> status also can serve as a case study of the broader subject. The present analysis takes the basic form of a historical narrative that analyzes Ukrainian, Polish, and Russian views of their shared history and divergent visions of the strategic future. This thesis provides a current prognosis as to the likelihood of <b>Ukraine</b> joining <b>NATO</b> and shows the limits and potential of the westernization process, security threats in the region, Russian democratization, and Russian engagement in international relations with <b>NATO</b> and <b>Ukraine...</b>|$|R
