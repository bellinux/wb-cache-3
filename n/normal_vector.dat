5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{has also}} been studied for curves in {{three-dimensional}} Euclidean space. The <b>normal</b> <b>vector</b> in this case can be defined (as in the plane) as the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to arc length, normalized to be a unit vector; {{it is one of}} the components of the Frenet–Serret frame. It is not well defined at points of zero curvature, but the product of the curvature and the <b>normal</b> <b>vector</b> remains well defined at those points, allowing the curve-shortening flow to be defined. Curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow, and the flow may lead to singularities in the curves; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane. The curve shortening flow for space curves has been used as a way to define flow past singularities in plane curves.|$|E

5000|$|The {{notion of}} an [...] "apparent horizon" [...] begins {{with the notion of}} a trapped null surface. A (compact, orientable, spacelike) surface always has 2 {{independent}} forward-in-time pointing, lightlike, normal directions. For example, a (spacelike) sphere in Minkowski space has lightlike vectors pointing inward and outward along the radial direction. The inward-pointing, lightlike <b>normal</b> <b>vectors</b> converge, while the outward-pointing, lightlike <b>normal</b> <b>vectors</b> diverge. It can, however, happen that both inward-pointing and outward-pointing lightlike <b>normal</b> <b>vectors</b> converge. In such a case, the surface is called trapped.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{incomplete}} triangular mesh including reversed {{faces and}} gaps between boundary edges is directly offset for NC machining. For three-axis machining, vertical faces are deleted {{and the face}} <b>normal</b> <b>vectors</b> directing {{the lower part of}} model are changed to upward. The complete mesh is offset by the multiple <b>normal</b> <b>vectors</b> of a vertex, and boundary edges and boundary vertices are offset by the virtual multiple <b>normal</b> <b>vectors</b> of a boundary vertex. For five-axis machining, mesh is offset to both directions by the reversed multiple <b>normal</b> <b>vectors.</b> Using this method, the CL surface is directly obtained from an incomplete triangular mesh. To show that the proposed offset method is effective for NC machining, the tool path generated from the CL surface is verified by simulation and real NC machining. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

25|$|The phase {{ambiguity}} {{reflects the}} fact that, as Witten has shown, the quantum correlation functions are not fully defined by the classical data. The linking number of a loop with itself enters into the calculation of the partition function, but this number is not invariant under small deformations and in particular, is not a topological invariant. This number can be rendered well defined if one chooses a framing for each loop, which is a choice of preferred nonzero <b>normal</b> <b>vector</b> at each point along which one deforms the loop to calculate its self-linking number. This procedure {{is an example of}} the point-splitting regularization procedure introduced by Paul Dirac and Rudolf Peierls to define apparently divergent quantities in quantum field theory in 1934.|$|E

500|$|In the curve-shortening flow, {{each point}} of a curve moves in the {{direction}} of a <b>normal</b> <b>vector</b> to the curve, at a rate proportional to the curvature.

500|$|In front {{tracking}} {{methods for}} curve shortening, the curve undergoing the evolution is discretized as a polygon. The {{finite difference method}} is used to derive formulas for the approximate <b>normal</b> <b>vector</b> and curvature at each vertex of the polygon, and these values are used {{to determine how to}} move each vertex in each time step. Although the curve-shortening flow is defined by the motion of a curve perpendicularly to itself, some parameterizations of the curve-shortening flow may allow the vertices that approximate the curve to move non-perpendicularly. In effect, this allows the vertices to move along the curve, as the curve evolves. Choosing a careful reparameterization can help redistribute the vertices more evenly along the curve in situations where perpendicular motion would cause them to bunch up. [...] write that these methods are fast and accurate but that it is much more complicated to extend them to versions of the curve-shortening flow that apply to more complicated inputs than simple closed curves, where it is necessary to deal with singularities and changes of topology.|$|E

They are fundamental for accurate measurement of wall thickness, which is a very important parameter in assessing ventricular function. In this work, we present a novel technique for computing ac-curate <b>normal</b> <b>vectors.</b> This technique is based on variational calculus. It explicitly enforces and controls the smoothness of <b>normal</b> <b>vectors</b> along and across outlines. The computed <b>normal</b> <b>vectors</b> are used to describe {{the surface of the}} LV through the t of local osculating paraboloids, from which principal curvatures and principal directions are also computed. Besides being fast and simple, this approach applies equally well to the right ventricle, and more generally to any surface sampled in terms of digitised outlines. Extensive experiments are performed using simulated surfaces, for varying sampling resolution to determine the robustness and accuracy of the our method. Finally, this method is applied to segmented MR images of the human left ventricle, and the results are presented. ...|$|R
