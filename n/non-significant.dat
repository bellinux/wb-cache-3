25|$|The {{accident}} crystallized anti-nuclear {{safety concerns}} among activists {{and the general}} public, resulted in new regulations for the nuclear industry, and has been cited as {{a contributor to the}} decline of a new reactor construction program that was already underway in the 1970s. The partial meltdown resulted in the release of radioactive gases and radioactive iodine into the environment. Worries were expressed by anti-nuclear movement activists; however, epidemiological studies analyzing the rate of cancer in and around the area since the accident, determined there was a small statistically <b>non-significant</b> increase in the rate and thus no causal connection linking the accident with these cancers has been substantiated. Cleanup started in August 1979, and officially ended in December 1993, with a total cleanup cost of about $1billion.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, in , Kutner and Olsen refuted {{claims that}} violent video games cause an {{increase}} in violent behavior in children. They report there is a scientifically <b>non-significant</b> trend showing that adolescents who do not play video games at all are most at risk for violent behavior and video game play {{is part of an}} adolescent boy's normal social setting. However, the authors did not completely deny the negative influences of violent (M-rated) video games on pre-teens and teenagers: Kutner and Olson suggested the views of alarmists and those of representatives of the video game industry are often supported by flawed or misconstrued studies and that the factors leading to violence in children and adolescents were more subtle than whether or not they played violent video games.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, a {{study by}} Dietz, {{conducted}} at the University of Central Florida, found that of thirty-three games sampled, 41% did not feature female characters, 28% sexually objectified women, 21% depicted violence against women, and 30% did not represent the female population at all. Furthermore, characterizations of women tended to be stereotypical: highly sexualized ("visions of beauty with large breasts and hips"), dependent ("victim or as the proverbial Damsel in Distress"), opponents ("evil or as obstacles {{to the goal of}} the game"), and trivial ("females depicted in fairly <b>non-significant</b> roles"). However, the study is criticized for not including a wide range of video games for study and for including old games published up to twenty years ago which do not represent current industry standards, for example, an increased presence of strong female characters.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that people with high EI have greater mental health, job performance, and {{leadership}} skills although no causal relationships have been shown and such findings {{are likely to be}} attributable to general intelligence and specific personality traits rather than emotional intelligence as a construct. For example, Goleman indicated that EI accounted for 67% of the abilities deemed necessary for superior performance in leaders, and mattered twice as much as technical expertise or IQ. Other research finds that the effect of EI on leadership and managerial performance is <b>non-significant</b> when ability and personality are controlled for, and that general intelligence correlates very closely with leadership. Markers of EI and methods of developing it have become more widely coveted in the past decade. In addition, studies have begun to provide evidence to help characterize the neural mechanisms of emotional intelligence.|$|E
25|$|An {{update on}} the above study; it employs the same methodology, has a larger sample (20,055 {{respondent}}s), and a broader respondent age range (16–69). The study found that 96.5% of the entire sample (or 96.8% {{of the men and}} 96.3% of the women) identified as heterosexual, a drop from the 2003 findings (97.5%). Homosexuals accounted for 1.9% of the male population and 1.2% of the female population, a <b>non-significant</b> difference between the sexes. Bisexuals accounted for 1.3% of the male population and 2.2% of the female population. Women were significantly {{more likely than men to}} identify as bisexual, and less likely to report exclusively other-sex or same-sex attraction and experience. Similarly, more women reported same-sex experience and same-sex attraction. Nine percent of men and 19% of women had some history of same-sex attraction or experience. More women identified as lesbian or bisexual than in 2001–02. Homosexual/gay identity was more common among men with university education and living in cities, and much less common among men with blue-collar jobs. Both male and female bisexuality were more common among respondents under the age of 20. Male bisexuality was also overrepresented among men in their sixties.|$|E

Colour can be <b>non-significant,</b> e.g. directly useful for absorbing heat, Poulton argues, but [...] "By far the most widespread use of colour is to assist an animal in escaping from its enemies or in capturing its prey; the former is Protective, the latter Aggressive [...]" [...] The topics of mimicry, warning coloration, and sexual selection are introduced.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Bosson, Swann and Pennebaker tested seven {{measures}} of implicit self-esteem, including the birthday-number task and name-letter task, and four {{measures of}} explicit self-esteem. They used a 7-point rating scale {{instead of the}} 6-point scale Kitayama and Karasawa had used, and they only looked at {{the day of the}} birthday. On average respondents scored their birthday number 0.73 higher than the other numbers. When the researchers retested all seven implicit self-esteem measures, the birthday-number task was one of three that produced similar results. [...] From the weak or <b>non-significant</b> correlations between the implicit and explicit self-esteem measures they concluded that implicit and explicit self-esteem are tapping different underlying constructs.|$|E
2500|$|John Gofman {{used his}} own, non-peer {{reviewed}} low-level radiation health model to predict 333 excess cancer or leukemia deaths from the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. A peer-reviewed research article by Dr. Steven Wing {{found a significant}} increase in cancers from 1979–1985 among people who lived within ten miles of TMI; in 2009 Dr. Wing stated that radiation releases during the accident were probably [...] "thousands of times greater" [...] than the NRC's estimates. A retrospective study of Pennsylvania Cancer Registry found an increased incidence of thyroid cancer in counties south of TMI and in high-risk age groups but did not draw a causal link with these incidences and to the accident. The Talbott lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported finding only a few, small, mostly statistically <b>non-significant,</b> increased cancer risks within the TMI population, such as a <b>non-significant</b> excess leukemia among males being observed. The ongoing TMI epidemiological research has been accompanied by a discussion of problems in dose estimates {{due to a lack of}} accurate data, as well as illness classifications.|$|E
2500|$|An Italian {{study of}} about 3,300 men {{published}} in European Urology concluded that flaccid stretched length was measured on average to about [...] In addition, they checked for correlations {{in a random}} subset of the sample consisting of 325 men. They found a few statistically significant Spearman's correlations: between flaccid length and height of 0.208, −0.140 with weight, and −0.238 with BMI, flaccid circumference and height 0.156, stretched length and height 0.221, weight −0.136, BMI −0.169. They also reported a few <b>non-significant</b> correlations.|$|E
2500|$|Firstly, {{questionable}} research practices (QRP) {{have been}} identified as common in the field. [...] Such practices, while not necessarily intentionally fraudulent, involve converting undesired statistical outcomes into desired outcomes via the manipulation of statistical analyses, sample size or data management, typically to convert <b>non-significant</b> findings into significant ones. [...] Some studies have suggested that at least mild versions of QRP are highly prevalent. One of the critics of Daryl Bem in the feeling the future controversy has suggested that the evidence for precognition in this study could (at least in part) be attributed to QRP.|$|E
2500|$|A 2001 {{meta-analysis}} {{commissioned by}} the Australian government {{said that there was}} [...] "overwhelming evidence in support of helmets for preventing head injury and fatal injury". A 2012 re-analysis, by Elvik, concluded that the 2001 meta-analysis [...] "was influenced by publication bias and time-trend bias that was not controlled for. As a result, the analysis reported inflated estimates of the effects of bicycle helmets". Elvik writes [...] "When the risk of injury to head, face or neck is viewed as a whole, bicycle helmets do provide a small protective effect. This effect is statistically significant in older studies. New studies, summarised by a random-effects model of analysis, indicate only a statistically <b>non-significant</b> protective effect".|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{a report}} of three studies {{conducted}} among students of different age groups in Singapore, Japan, and the United States, found that prosocial mostly nonviolent games increased helpful prosocial behaviour among the participants. In 2010, Anderson's group published a meta-analysis of one hundred and thirty international studies with over 130,000 participants. He reported that exposure to violent video games caused both short-term and long-term aggression in players and decreased empathy and pro-social behavior. [...] However, other scholars criticized this meta-analysis for excluding <b>non-significant</b> studies and for other methodological flaws. Anderson's group have defended their analysis, rejecting these critiques. [...] Rowell Huesmann, a psychology and social studies academic at the University of Michigan wrote an editorial supporting the Anderson meta-analysis.|$|E

Yamamoto {{in a sample of}} secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of r = [...]3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children. Fuchs-Beauchamp et al. in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from r = [...]19 to r = [...]49 in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold; and in the group above the threshold, the correlations were r = <.12. Cho et al. reported a correlation of [...]40 between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults; and a correlation of close to r = [...]0 for the high IQ group. Jauk et al. found support for the TT, but only for measures of creative potential; not creative performance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relative}} risk (RR) {{of breast cancer}} varies from 1.24 in the WHI study to 1.66 in the Million Women Study, with results differing according to interval between menopause and hormone therapy and methods of hormone replacement. The WHI preliminary results in 2004 found a <b>non-significant</b> trend in the estrogen-alone clinical trial towards a reduced {{risk of breast cancer}} and a 2006 update concluded that use of estrogen-only HRT for 7 years does not increase {{the risk of breast cancer}} in postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy. The results of the WHI estrogen-alone trial suggest that the progestin used in the WHI estrogen-plus-progestin trial increased the risk for breast cancer above that associated with estrogen alone. HRT has been more strongly associated with risk of breast cancer in women with low or normal body mass index (BMI) of less than 25, but no association has been observed in women with a high body mass index.|$|E
2500|$|A 2009 {{study on}} two {{separate}} samples of male undergraduate students in Canada found that 62 to 65%, {{depending on the}} sample, had entertained sadistic fantasies, and 22 to 39% engaged in sadistic behaviors during sex. The figures were 62 and 52% for bondage fantasies, and 14 to 23% for bondage behaviors. A 2014 study involving a mixed sample of Canadian college students and online volunteers, both male and female, reported that 19% of male samples and 10% of female samples rated the sadistic scenarios described in a questionnaire as being at least [...] "slightly arousing" [...] {{on a scale that}} ranged from [...] "very repulsive" [...] to [...] "very arousing"; the difference was statistically significant. The corresponding figures for the masochistic scenarios were 15% for male students and 17% for female students, a <b>non-significant</b> difference. In a 2011 study on 367 middle-aged and elderly men recruited from the broader community in Berlin, 21.8% of the men self-reported sadistic fantasies and 15.5% sadistic behaviors; 24.8% self-reported any such fantasy and/or behavior. The corresponding figures for self-reported masochism were 15.8% for fantasy, 12.3% for behavior, and 18.5% for fantasy and/or behavior. In a 2008 study on gay men in Puerto Rico, 14.8% of the over 425 community volunteers reported any sadistic fantasy, desire or behavior in their lifetime; the corresponding figure for masochism was 15.7%.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, a study {{approved}} by Iowa State University assessed whether prosocial games could promote helpful behavior in children. [...] In this study, children aged 9–14 years old played three {{different types of}} video games. They were first assessed for aggression {{in order to avoid}} confounding. [...] Afterwards, they completed a puzzle task with a partner and then assigned tangrams to a fictitious person in another room. [...] The participants were told that the person in the other room, who they did not know was not actually real, had an opportunity to win a prize. [...] The children were told they were not eligible for the gift card. [...] The measure for helpful or hurtful behavior was based on how many easy or difficult tangrams they assigned to the fictitious person. [...] Results indicated that playing prosocial games significantly more helpful behaviors in children than those who played violent video games. [...] Conversely, playing violent video games had significantly more hurtful behaviors in children than the children who played prosocial games. [...] Deviations from the expected pattern were also <b>non-significant.</b> [...] The short-term effects observed after only thirty minutes of playing are substantial enough to consider the possibility that the longer amount of time a child plays a video game, the more effect it will have on their behavior. [...] The researchers concluded that playing prosocial games affects a child's social cognition, because it changes their attitudes and affect. [...] It is also important to note that outside the confines of a study, playing a video game may affect how a child acts, {{but it is not the}} only factor present that can affect this.|$|E
2500|$|When one {{speaks about}} any major sort of modern {{scholarly}} or historiographic activities in Eastern Galicia {{that started with}} Haskalah movement in this area, such activities are bound to three exclusive centers of the Galician Enlightenment, namely: Lviv, Ternopil and Brody. Today {{the latter is a}} <b>non-significant</b> West Ukrainian town, administrative center of Brodivsky rayon in the north-eastern fringe of Lvivska oblast. There are few towns in Western Ukraine with so dramatic and challenging Jewish history as it is in case of Brody. For a long time Brody {{had been one of the}} greatest centers of commerce in the whole Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was rightly referred to as Triest on the continent. The town has been known yet since the 12th century and soon after was almost entirely inhabited by the Jews. Because of the last fact it came known to be as Galician Jerusalem. During the Austrian rule in Galicia, the North Eastern fringe of the empire passed just a few kilometres from Brody. It was the border of two greatest East European empires at that time Austrian and Russian and Brody by the luck or misfortune of history happened to be squeezed between the two borders. By misfortune, because of its border location it was twice utterly destroyed first during the First World War and again in 1944. By luck, because the city took a great commercial benefit and privileges being a border city. Because of its location, in 1779, Brody received the status of a [...] "free city" [...] and could trade with all the European countries. Worthwhile to note that in the 18th century the commercial turnover of Brody city exceeded the turnover of whole province of Galicia taken together. In the 19th century it was the second largest city on the territory of Galicia after Lemberg. Its [...] "sister city" [...] over the Russian side of the border was Radyvyliv just 9km east of Brody. Radyvyliv played a similar function as Brody on the Russian side of the border.|$|E
