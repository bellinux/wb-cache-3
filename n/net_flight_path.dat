40|$|Introduction: When {{deriving}} {{an objective}} assessment of piloting performance from flight data records, {{it is common}} to employ metrics which purely evaluate errors in <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> parameters. The adequacy of pilot performance is evaluated from the <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> of the aircraft. However, in large jet transport aircraft these measures may be insensitive and require supplementing with frequency-based measures of control input parameters. Method: <b>Flight</b> <b>path</b> and control input data were collected from pilots undertaking a jet transport aircraft conversion course during a series of symmetric and asymmetric approaches in a flight simulator. The <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> data were analyzed for deviations around the optimum <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> while flying an instrument landing approach. Manipulation of the flight controls was subject to analysis using a series of power spectral density measures. Results: The <b>flight</b> <b>path</b> metrics showed no significant differences in performance between the symmetric and asymmetric approaches. However, control input frequency domain measures revealed that the pilots employed highly different control strategies in the pitch and yaw axes. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that to evaluate pilot performance fully in large aircraft, it is necessary to employ performance metrics targeted at both the outer control loop (<b>flight</b> <b>path)</b> and the inner control loop (flight control) parameters in parallel, evaluating both the product and process of a pilot's performance...|$|R
