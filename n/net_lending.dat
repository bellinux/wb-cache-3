40|$|There {{was very}} little <b>net</b> new <b>lending</b> by U. S. banks to {{developing}} countries in 1983 - 84, following the heavy lending of preceding years. When non-spontaneous lending to Brazil, Mexico and some other Latin American countries is deducted, there was an absolute decline in U. S. banks' claims on these countries. However, estimates of <b>net</b> new <b>lending</b> based on charges in outstanding claims understate the amount of <b>net</b> new <b>lending</b> to these countries in 1983 - 84 by an amount {{on the order of}} $ 3 - 1 / 2 billion. This is because outstanding claims were reduced by a number of factors other than repayments; such factors included loan charge-offs, sales of claims to non-bank investors, the exercise of official guarantees, and the statistical effects of exchange rate charges. Other aspects of U. S. bank lending to develop countries in 1983 - 84 were an increased concentration of the outstanding claims at the largest banks, and an increased concentration of the claims towards the public sector of the borrowing countries. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes and {{examines}} {{a model of}} the relationship between elements of product design and software quality in open source software (OSS) development projects. Research suggests that product design, or product architecture, affects work processes and outputs in the production of goods and services. In the case of software, we therefore hypothesize that product architecture affects characteristics of subsequent code contributions, which in turn affect product quality. An analysis of 203 software releases in 46 OSS projects hosted on SourceForge. <b>net</b> <b>lends</b> support for the hypothesized relationship between software modularity and software development, suggesting that the degree of software modularity is positively associated with the number of contribution opportunities and the number of code contributions, and negatively associated with contribution size. In addition, we find that software modularity is associated with reduced software complexity, one common measure of software quality. Surprisingly we find that software modularity is associated with an increased number of static software bugs and number of bugs reported, additional measures of software quality. However, opportunities to contribute mediates the relationship between degree of modularity and number of static bugs and bugs reported to yield the expected relationship between modularity and bugs. In addition to proposing and testing relationships between elements of software development and software quality, we introduce new measures of modularity and software quality. Implications are developed for the theory of modularity and the practice of software development...|$|R

50|$|The Mortgage {{industry}} of the United Kingdom {{has traditionally been}} dominated by building societies, but from the 1970s {{the share of the}} new mortgage loans market held by building societies has declined substantially. Between 1977 and 1987, the share fell drastically from 96% to 66% while that of banks and other institutions rose from 3% to 36%. The major lenders include building societies, banks, specialized mortgage corporations, insurance companies, and pension funds. During the four years following the Financial crisis of 2008 the UK mutual sector provided approximately 80% of <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> to the housing market. There are currently over 200 significant separate financial organizations supplying mortgage loans to house buyers in Britain of which the Lloyds Bank and the Nationwide Building Society have the largest market share.|$|E
5000|$|A 2007 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report {{noted that}} the [...] "excess of gross saving over fixed {{investment}} (i.e. <b>net</b> <b>lending)</b> in the [...] "aggregate OECD corporate sector" [...] had been unusually large since 2002. In a 2006 International Monetary Fund report, it was observed that, [...] "since the bursting of the equity marketbubble in the early 2000s, companies in many industrial countries have moved from their traditional position of borrowing funds to finance their capital expenditures to running financial surpluses {{that they are now}} lending to other sectors of the economy". David Wessell in a Wall Street Journal article observed that, [...] "companies, which normally borrow other folks’ savings in order to invest, have turned thrifty. Even companies enjoying strong profits and cash flow are building cash hoards, reducing debt and buying back their own shares—instead of making investment bets." [...] Although the hypothesis of excess cash holdings or cash hoarding has been used by the OECD, the International Monetary Fund and the media (Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation), the concept itself has been disputed and criticized as conceptually flawed in articles and reports published by the Hoover Institute, the Max-Planck Institute and the CATO Institute among others.

5000|$|In Azerbaijan, on January 1, 2001, a new {{tax code}} went into effect. Personal income rates {{remained}} the same, at rates ranging from 12-35%, as did the corporate tax rate, at 27%. However, as of 2005, the corporate rate was set at 24%. The revised depreciation schedule for corporate assets favors investments in high-tech equipment and oil and gas exploration. Depreciation rates are 10% a year for buildings, 25% a year for equipment and computers, 25% for geological and exploratory costs, and 20% a year for all other assets. However, accelerated depreciation is allowed for capital spending allocated for production purposes at twice the standard rates. Included in this are expenditures on the building of those facilities {{that are to be}} used in the actual manufacture of goods. The value-added tax (VAT) was reduced from 20% to 18%, while the property tax was raised from [...]5% to 1% of assessed value. A [...]05% Road Fund Tax on turnover was abolished, but there is a highway tax imposed on foreign-registered vehicles collected by customs authorities. There are payroll taxes paid by the employer amounting to 32%, 30% going to the Social Protection Fund, and 2% going to the Employment Fund. There are excise taxes, but excise paid for goods used in production can be off set against excise charged for the finished product. In 2001, total government revenue came to an estimated 21.4% of GDP, while total expenditures, including <b>net</b> <b>lending,</b> amounted to only 20% of GDP, producing a positive fiscal balance equal to 1.4% of GDP.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the same}} lines as {{described}} earlier, expansionary monetary policy causes stock prices to rise. When the stock price of a company increases, also the net worth of a company increases. This holds because the market capitalization of a company {{is equal to the}} total value of its outstanding stocks, which in turn provides a proxy for the company’s <b>net</b> worth. <b>Lending</b> to companies with a lower net worth is more risky because these companies generally have less collateral and so the changes of potential losses are higher. This increases the risk of moral hazard and adverse selection problems for firms with a lower net worth. Therefore, a decline in net worth increases moral hazard and adverse selection problems and may lead to less lending to finance investment spending.|$|R

The paper also introduces alternative definitions of quasi-fiscal deficit, and discusses the same issues in the context of these definitions. Foreign exchange losses and the distinction between nominal and real deficits are discussed in greater detail, since these issues are even more relevant {{in the case of the}} central bank. The authors also merge the accounts of the non-financial and financial public sector into a consolidated budget constraint.

40|$|The paper investigates <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> and net {{borrowing}} flows {{of the institutional}} sectors in Europe since {{the introduction of the}} Euro in 1999. Applying a simple statistical apparatus, this paper is novel in describing the sectoral behavior leading up to and during the crisis. We find that (1) many countries of the Northern group were characterized by low public deficits or even budget surpluses, current account surpluses and a private sector in a <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> position. In countries of the Southern periphery, in the Anglo-Saxon countries as well as in many Eastern European Economies private sector {{net borrowing}} coincided with a budget deficit and substantial current account deficits. (2) With the onset of the crisis private <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> soared in all countries while all governments incurred deficits, consistent with the notion of a balance sheet recession. (3) Private <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> is pro-cyclical, reinforcing the economic downturn, while public <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> is countercyclical in all countries.

We find that, firstly, rising personal inequality leads to a decrease of household <b>net</b> <b>lending</b> and the current account, ceteris paribus. The effect is strong for top household income shares, but much weaker for the Gini coefficient of household income. This finding is consistent with consumption externalities resulting from upward-looking status comparisons.
