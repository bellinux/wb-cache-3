5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} the Junta Grande {{assisted}} to Alberti's funeral, even his political enemy Gregorio Funes. Domingo Matheu was the most affected one by his death, {{to the point of}} crying for it. Alberti was replaced in the Junta by Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, a decided morenist. Saavedra and Funes did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> but with the social commotion generated by Alberti's death, they avoided to offer resistance to his nomination.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E

[...] There was a kind of logic in this that silenced Mrs. Kenton for the moment. In view of her {{advantage}} Lottie relented so far as to add, [...] "I've found out something about him." ...|$|R

5|$|The Life of Samuel Johnson or Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D. {{was written}} by John Hawkins in 1787. It was the first full {{biography}} of Samuel Johnson—with Thomas Tyers's A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson being the first short postmortem biography. Hawkins {{was a friend of}} Johnson, but many in Johnson's circle did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> After Johnson's death, Hawkins was approached to produce a biography on Johnson and an edition of his works. His biography described Johnson's life, including previously unknown details about his writing career, but it was plagued by digressions into unrelated topics. Hawkins's Life of Samuel Johnson came under swift attack from critics, from friends of Johnson, and from his literary rival, James Boswell immediately after its publication. Many of the critics attacked Hawkins for his lack of strict focus on Johnson's life or for his unfavourable depiction of Johnson in various circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Libby is {{involved}} in a motorbike accident that leaves her with a small chance of carrying a baby to full term. Susan and Karl break the news to her. Libby later falls pregnant and gives birth to Susan and Karl's first grandchild, Ben (Noah Sutherland). Susan almost loses her job as principal when a student reports her for assault; however, the case is later dropped. Susan's nephew Darcy Tyler becomes partner in Karl's surgery and plots to sell the business to a clinic chain. Darcy tells Karl and Susan what he is doing, and Susan is furious with her nephew. Susan's sister, Liz (Christine Keogh), leaves her daughter Elly (Kendell Nunn) with the Kennedys for a brief time; Elly later joins her mother in Sweden. Susan slips on some spilt milk and wakes up with retrograde amnesia. She loses thirty years of her memory and believes she is sixteen and the year is 1972. Susan goes through months of counselling to try and regain her memory. During this time, she tells Karl that she does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> and she goes missing when she tries to find an old boyfriend. Susan begins having flashbacks and starts to regain her memory. Libby's husband Drew Kirk (Dan Paris) dies and Susan finds it hard to comfort her daughter.

60|$|I felt deeply {{grateful}} to Billy, and sorry that I had <b>not</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> better. Somehow, nobody did like Billy Robinson over and above. But I vowed I WOULD <b>like</b> <b>him</b> in future. I paid him the ten cents cheerfully {{and took the}} magic seed as directed, measuring myself carefully every day by a mark on the hall door. I could not see any advance in growth yet, but then I had been taking it only three days.|$|R

500|$|At dinner, Brian {{attempts}} to make small talk, but Quagmire does not soften up. Finally, Brian asks Quagmire why he does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> Quagmire responds with an angry tirade detailing everything about Brian he finds reprehensible, {{at the end of}} which he calls Brian [...] "a big, sad, alcoholic bore". Brian then returns home, having been crying on the way back. Stewie cheers him up by saying that he only needs to like himself, and then professes his own admiration for Brian by letting him spend the night in his room.|$|E
500|$|In {{his youth}} at the University of Edinburgh, Brown was {{involved}} in a romantic relationship with Margarita, Crown Princess of Romania. Margarita said about it: [...] "It was a very solid and romantic story. I never stopped loving him but one day it didn't seem right any more, it was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing." [...] An unnamed friend of those years is quoted by Paul Routledge in his biography of Brown as recalling: [...] "She was sweet and gentle and obviously cut out to make somebody a very good wife. She was bright, too, though <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> but they seemed made for each other." ...|$|E

500|$|During the pre-vote discussion, {{the other}} celebrity judges insult Sue for {{her lack of}} fame. Aural Intensity is named runner-up, and Vocal Adrenaline wins, with New Directions coming in last. Emma argues with Figgins about the club's future, but he remains intent on {{disbanding}} it, since it failed to place. Will has accepted their loss, and professes his love for Emma and kisses her. Sue overhears New Directions' performance of [...] "To Sir With Love" [...] in appreciation of all that Will has done to help them grow. It is revealed that Sue voted for New Directions to win, and has agreed to end her blackmail of Principal Figgins in exchange for giving New Directions {{at least one more}} year to prove themselves and win Regionals. She explains to Will that she may <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> but she respects his work with the students. Will tells the club of its extension, and performs Israel Kamakawiwoʻole's version of [...] "Over the Rainbow" [...] with Puck in celebration.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great". He referred to [...] "Mars, Bars" [...] {{as one of the}} finest episodes of season three, praising the Valentine's Day subplot, the development of the mystery of Dean O'Dell's death, and Muhney's performance. Regarding Logan, he opined that although he did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> moping after his breakup with Veronica, this episode fixed that by including him in the Valentine's Day subplot and setting up a romantic relationship with Parker: [...] "it's just a huge relief to see Logan in a different light and interacting with different people, finally." [...] He also praised Lamb's death scene as being devoid of clichés by not giving him an act of heroism for his dying moments. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, lauded the episode. He saw the episode and the previous episode as a return to form for Veronica Mars, writing, [...] "it's episodes like these last two that remind me of what this show looks like when it's really cooking." [...] He also enjoyed the lack of a redemptive moment for Lamb {{at the end of his}} life as well as the comedic value of some scenes in the episode.|$|E
500|$|When Dewey Phillips first aired [...] "That's All Right" [...] on Memphis radio, many {{listeners}} who {{contacted the}} station by phone and telegram {{to ask for}} it again assumed that its singer was black. From {{the beginning of his}} national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of [...] "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] The Memphis World, an African American newspaper, reported that Presley, [...] "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", [...] "cracked Memphis's segregation laws" [...] by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its [...] "colored night". Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom. By contrast, many white adults, according to Billboards Arnold Shaw, [...] "did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to Boruto's {{character has}} been generally mixed. Upon first seeing him Ramsey Isler from IGN found him too similar {{to his father}}. On the other hand, Andy Hanley from UK Anime Network said despite his similar design and actions to his father Naruto, Boruto is <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> and has a different personality. Amy McNulty from Anime News Network and Hanley enjoyed Boruto's relationship with his father Naruto due to the differences in their childhoods and how that becomes {{the focus of the}} film Boruto: Naruto the Movie. McNulty also liked how Boruto develops as he became afraid of his father's fate during an attack from the antagonist. She praised Amanda C. Miller's role as Boruto's English actor, but feeling the voice often sounded more feminine that his Japanese counterpart. Christian Chiok from Japanator enjoyed Boruto's character development, his relationship with his father, and how heartwarming it becomes in the movie. Alexandria Hill from Otaku USA enjoyed Boruto's fight against the film's villain and his team up with Naruto and Sasuke. Chris Zimmerman from DVD Talk noted how the writers fairly conceived Boruto's poor relationship with his father and how it improves during the climax of the film. Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised how the writers manage to develop Boruto's angst without coming across as [...] "teen whinning" [...] and how Sasuke Uchiha decides to train him upon seeing his similarities with his father. Leroy Douresseaux liked how Boruto's character has already started development by the second volume of the series.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Scott's {{efforts to}} {{preserve}} his anonymity, almost every reviewer guessed that Waverley was his work. Many readers too recognized his hand.
