We generalize this result to any neutral monotone aggregation. In addition, we show that acyclicity is neither necessary nor sufficient for transitivity for neutral non-monotone aggregation: we construct a cyclic transitive domain and introduce strong acyclicity as a sufficient condition for transitivity. We also show that strong acyclicity is necessary if repeated transitivity is sought.

This work proposes an improved interdisciplinary concurrent product development process with an extended function structure, starting from the conceptual design phase.

An example shows how to use the extended function structure. The extended function structure is used to derive the initial logic used for {{the development}} of the PLC program controlling the machine later on. Since the extended function structure also covers the traditional information, it can still be used when building the assembly tree.

This is nowhere {{more evident than in}} contem-porary debates over the nature and morality of ’consumer society’. Recently in this journal, Schudson (1981) identified three major positions in the debate. Critics of both the capitalist economy and of advertising charge that modern marketing techniques create distorted and insatiable notions of human needs in order to increase consumption and, therefore, profits. Defenders of the status quo argue that the economic system discovers-rather than creates-needs and that modern marketing techniques perform a <b>neutral</b> <b>function</b> of informing the buyer of the availability of goods and services and facilitating their distribution. The third, relativist position holds that while needs cannot endlessly be created, neither are they merely discovered. Concepts of need arise from the individual’s station in life.

40|$|Arbitrating of {{competition}} law claims has generated a substantial {{tension between the}} policies served by promoting international arbitration and those protected by the national competition law. Despite the legal tension and unpredictability associated with arbitrating competition law issues, the arbitrator should, in principle, resolve such issues. This study analyses the main concerns when arbitrating competition law issues, such as jurisdiction, choice of law and, in particular, the position of national jurisdiction regarding {{the enforcement of the}} award conflicting national competition law. This study proposes the functional approach to choice of law problems according to which the arbitrator will decide on the applicable competition law bearing in mind the content of mandatory norm, its connection with a dispute and the consequences of its application and non-application. In that regard, this thesis will examine how an arbitrator should address the extraterritorial effect of the competition law. The study will suggest that if the competition law policies of states connected with a dispute serve opposing and conflicting goals, the arbitrator should, in order to preserve his/her <b>neutral</b> <b>function</b> refuse to decide whose competition policy is "better" and should consequently decline jurisdiction...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the {{estimation}} of risk neutral distributions for pricing index options resulting from the hypothesis of the risk neutral valuation principle. After justifying this hypothesis, we shall focus on parametric estimation methods for the risk <b>neutral</b> density <b>functions</b> determining the risk neutral distributions. We we shall differentiate between the direct and the indirect way. Following the direct way, parameter vectors are estimated which characterize the distributions from selected statistical families to model the risk neutral distributions. The idea of the indirect approach is to calibrate characteristic parameter vectors for stochastic models of the asset price processes, and then to extract the risk <b>neutral</b> density <b>function</b> via Fourier methods. For every of the reviewed methods the calculation of option prices under hypothetically true risk neutral distributions is a building block. We shall give explicit formula for call and put prices w. r. t. reviewed parametric statistical families used for direct estimation.

30|$|The {{study of}} {{controllability}} {{is one of}} the important parts of mathematical control theory in both deterministic and stochastic control theory. There are lots of publications working on control problems of various systems [1 – 4]. Complete controllability means the systems can be steered to arbitrary final state while the systems with approximate controllability just can be steered to a small neighborhood of the final state. Even though the concept of the approximate controllability is weaker than the complete controllability, it is prevalent to consider approximate controllable systems which can be adequate in application [5 – 7]. In fact, the approximate controllability of systems represented by nonlinear evolution equations has been studied by several authors. In [8], Sakthivel et al. studied a class of control systems governed by the semilinear fractional differential equations in Hilbert spaces by using the semigroup theory, the fractional power theory and fixed point theorem. Fu and Mei [9] investigated the approximate controllability of semilinear <b>neutral</b> <b>functions</b> differential systems with finite delay.|$|R

The catalytic action of PVIm was more effective than that of imidazole in the pH range 7 - 8. The origin is attributed to the intramolecular interaction of <b>neutral</b> imidazole <b>functions</b> pendent along the PVIm chain. The PVIm-catalyzed reaction of l-acetylbenztriazole (ABT) followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics which indicates that the reaction proceeds via complexation of the catalytically active site with an attracted substrate. The shrinked form of PVIm molecule resulting from the change in solvent composition of the reaction medium causes a large enhancement of catalytic rate, which will be originated from the multifunctional interaction of <b>neutral</b> imidazole <b>functions</b> of PVIm. Similar results are Observable on the enzymatic reaction. 　　ポリ－ 4 (5) －バニルイミダゾール(PVIm) 解媒による活性アミド（アゾリド）の加溶媒分解を中性低分子基質を用いて検討した。これは一部前報にて報告したが，当研究により酵素反応と関係づけた。PVImの触媒作用ほpH 7 - 8 の範囲でイミダゾールの作用より大きかった。その原因はPVIm鎖上にある中性イミダゾール基の分子内相互作用に帰せられる。 1 －アセチルベンゾトリアゾール(ABT) のPVIm触媒による反応は Michalis-Meten 動力学に従い，触媒反応が活性部位と引きつけられた基質との錯体形成を経て進むことを示す。反応液の溶媒組成の変化によりもたらされるPVImの縮んだ形態は，触媒反応速度を大きく増加させるが，これはPVImの中性イミダブール基の多官能性相互作用によるものである。同様な結果が酵素反応でも認められる...|$|R

Fifty-seven participants were exposed to a stimulus-pairing procedure that paired six nonsense syllables with aversive images, and a further six stimuli with neutral images. A second phase established different operant response functions for one aversive CS and one neutral CS. In Phase 3, 45 of the 57 participants demonstrated a transfer of the established operant response to stimuli sharing respondent functions, thereby demonstrating the formation of two functional classes. Using a between-subjects design, participants were then exposed to a conditional discrimination training and testing protocol designed to establish two three-member stimulus equivalence relations using either six aversive or six emotionally neutral CSs as stimuli.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper [1] we have defined the Nearer is Better degree of a function, defined in [0, 1]. We use it {{here as a}} measure of {{how difficult it is to}} find the position of the minimum of a function by using an iterative optimiser. The function is said to be deceptive when the degree is greater than 0. 5, neutral for value 0. 5, and nice for smaller values. We will show, either formally (mainly for dimension one) or experimentally, that the cardinality of the set of <b>neutral</b> <b>functions</b> is negligible and that there are as many deceptive functions as nice ones. We also show that deceptive functions are not necessarily "monstrous". We define a taxonomy of all possible functions, according to four criteria: degree of difficulty, presence of plateaus, number of global minima, and modality (unimodal or not). It appears that the structures of two classical benchmarks (CEC 2005 and CEC 2011) are far from this taxonomy. In particular they contain almost no deceptive functions. As all iterative optimisers assume, either implicitly or explicitly, that the functions they work on are nice, it means their efficiency on such benchmarks is not a good estimate of their performance on other functions...|$|R

The distribution function is {{described in terms of}} two velocity components (making use of the rotational symmetry in velocity space about the x-axis) and one spatial component (x).

In the present paper we prove a quantitative version of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem for general social choice functions for any number k ≥ 3 of alternatives. In particular we show that for a social choice function f on k ≥ 3 alternatives and n voters, which is ε-far from the family of nonmanipulable functions, a uniformly chosen voter profile is manipulable with probability at least inverse polynomial in n, k, and ε- 1. Removing the neutrality assumption of previous theorems is important for multiple reasons. For one, {{it is known that}} there is a conflict between anonymity and neutrality, and since most common voting rules are anonymous, they cannot always be neutral. Second, virtual elections are used in many applications in artificial intelligence, where there are often restrictions on the outcome of the election, and so neutrality is not a natural assumption in these situations. Ours is a unified proof which in particular covers all previous cases established before. The proof crucially uses reverse hypercontractivity in addition to several ideas from the two previous proofs. Much of the work is devoted to understanding functions of a single voter, and in particular we also prove a quantitative Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem for one voter...|$|R

The etching proceeds in a two-part process, where the chlorine neutrals passivate the Si surface and then the ions etch away SiClx. However, etching in more complicated gas mixtures and materials, such as etching of SiO 2 in Ar/C 4 F 8, requires knowledge of the ion and <b>neutral</b> distribution <b>functions</b> {{as a function of}} angle and velocity, in addition to modeling the gas surface reactions.

A unanimous <b>neutral</b> social choice <b>function</b> turns out to be universally self-selective if and only if it is Paretian and satisfies independence of irrelevant alternatives. The neutral unanimous social choice functions whose domains consist of linear order profiles on nonempty sets of any finite cardinality induce a class of social welfare functions that inherit Paretianism and independence of irrelevant alternatives in case the social choice function with which one starts is universally self-selective. Thus, a unanimous and <b>neutral</b> social choice <b>function</b> is universally self-selective if and only if it is dictatorial.
