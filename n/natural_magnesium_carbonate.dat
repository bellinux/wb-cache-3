40|$|<b>Magnesium</b> <b>carbonate</b> {{minerals}} {{produced by}} reaction of H 2 O–CO 2 with ultramafic rocks {{occur in a}} wide range of paragenetic and tectonic settings and can thus provide insights into a variety of geologic processes, including (1) deposition of ore-grade, massive-vein cryptocrystalline magnesite; (2) formation of hydrous <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates</b> in weathering environments; and (3) metamorphic carbonate alteration of ultramafic rocks. However, the application of traditional geochemical and isotopic methods to infer temperatures of mineralization, the nature of mineralizing fluids, and the mechanisms controlling the transformation of dissolved CO 2 into <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates</b> in these settings is difficult because the fluids are usually not preserved. Clumped-isotope compositions of <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates</b> provide a means to determine primary mineralization or (re) equilibration temperature, which permits the reconstruction of geologic processes that govern <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate</b> formation. We first provide an evaluation of the acid fractionation correction for <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates</b> using synthetic magnesite and hydromagnesite, along with natural metamorphic magnesite and low-temperature hydromagnesite precipitated within a mine adit. We show that the acid fractionation correction for <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates</b> is virtually indistinguishable from other carbonate acid fractionation corrections given current mass spectrometer resolution and error. In addition, we employ carbonate clumped-isotope thermometry on <b>natural</b> <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates</b> from various geologic environments and tectonic settings. Cryptocrystalline magnesite vein deposits from California (Red Mountain magnesite mine), Austria (Kraubath locality), Turkey (Tutluca mine, Eskişehir district) and Iran (Derakht-Senjed deposit) exhibit broadly uniform Δ 47 compositions that yield apparent clumped-isotope temperatures that average 23. 7 ± 5. 0 °C. Based on oxygen isotope thermometry, these clumped-isotope temperatures suggest mineralization at shallow crustal depths in the presence of meteoric water. Hydrous <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates</b> from a 400 -km latitudinal transect along the serpentinized-peridotite bodies of the California Coast Ranges record clumped-isotope temperatures between 14. 2 and 22. 7 ± 2. 8 °C, in agreement with historical maximum temperatures during the rainy season for California. Talc–carbonate alteration of ultramafic rocks in Greenland (Isua Supracrustal Belt) and Vermont (Ludlow) yields clumped-isotope alteration temperatures of magnesite and dolomite between 326 and 490 °C, broadly consistent with paragenesis and thermodynamic analysis for CO 2 metasomatism of ultramafic rocks. These metamorphic carbonates extend the applicability of clumped-isotope thermometry to high-temperature <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate</b> systems and indicate equilibrium blocking temperatures for magnesite of ∼ 490 °C. Our study demonstrates the applicability of the clumped isotope approach to provide information on the formation of <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates</b> as ore resources, surface records of climate, and metamorphic assemblages...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} oral <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate</b> or {{aluminium}} hydroxide on serum ionised calcium, total calcium, aluminium and magnesium, was assessed in 31 {{patients with chronic}} renal failure, during and after one haemodialysis. The behaviour of ionised calcium and total calcium was the same in both groups. Each showed a slight fall during dialysis, which was not significant. Serum total calcium was 0. 2 - 0. 3 mmol/ 1 (0. 8 - 1. 2 mg/dl) greater throughout the period of dialysis in the group taking aluminium hydroxide. Serum magnesium and aluminium were both lower in the group treated with <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate.</b> In the group taking <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate,</b> serum mag-nesium concentrations fell markedly during dialysis, but otherwise were maintained within the reference range {{by the use of}} a magnesium-free dialysate.
