However, the existence of any regulatory <b>device</b> <b>coordinating</b> these changes remains elusive. Here we show that in an exponentially growing Escherichia coli rpoZ mutant lacking the polymerase ω subunit, {{the impact of the}} Eσ 38 holoenzyme on transcription is enhanced in parallel with overall DNA relaxation. Conversely, overproduction of σ 70 in an rpoZ mutant increases both overall DNA supercoiling and the transcription of genes utilizing high negative superhelicity. We further show that transcription driven by the Eσ 38 and Eσ 70 holoenzymes from cognate promoters induces distinct superhelical densities of plasmid DNA in vivo. We thus demonstrate a tight coupling between polymerase holoenzyme composition and the supercoiling regimen of genomic transcription. Accordingly, we identify functional clusters of genes with distinct σ factor and supercoiling preferences arranging alternative transcription programs sustaining bacterial exponential growth. We propose that structural coupling between DNA topology and holoenzyme composition provides a basic regulatory <b>device</b> for <b>coordinating</b> genome-wide transcription during bacterial growth and adaptation...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} obtain the {{horizontal}} accelerations more accurately, our previous work has proposed a PCA-based approach called RMPCA [14], combining rotation matrix (RM) with principal component analysis (PCA) for user heading estimation. Firstly, we continuously track the device attitude by developing extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusing inertial sensors. Then, we combine related rotation matrix to project the accelerations at local <b>device</b> <b>coordinate</b> system (DCS) into the global coordinate system (GCS). Finally, the global walking direction may be extracted by PCA over horizontal accelerations. Due to gyro and acceleration drifts, the accuracy performance of user heading estimation and positioning may degrade rapidly over a relatively short period.|$|R

This conventional approach may cause instability of neuronal source localization when the estimated coil positions are not stable or when the coils are not tightly attached. This paper presents a new coordinate system alignment technique without using coils. Instead, the proposed method utilizes a calibrated camera to monitor feature points attached to the subject’s face. Coordinate system alignment is then achieved by determining the head pose in neuromagnetometer <b>device</b> <b>coordinate</b> system.
