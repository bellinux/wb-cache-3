25|$|Rapperswil-Jona {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} traffic junctions in the region, and Rapperswil railway station is a <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> for the Swiss Federal Railways, Südostbahn and S-Bahn Zürich lines. Zürichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (commonly abbreviated to ZSG) operates passenger vessels on the Lake Zürich, connecting surrounding towns between Zürich-Bürkliplatz and Rapperswil. The Seedamm, a dam across Lake Zürich, links Rapperswil with Hurden (SZ) on the other side of the lake. This connection has been part of old pilgrimage routes. From early centuries, a wooden footbridge led across Lake Zürich. At a later stage, the bridge was replaced by a stone dam. In 2001, a new wooden footbridge was opened alongside the dam for the first 840 meters of the crossing. It was built in the same place as the original bridge and links Rapperswil with the nearby bridge chapel (Heilig Hüsli) built in 1551.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} topological <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> can emerge in {{photonic}} crystal possessing mirror symmetry. The mechanism of generating topological <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> {{is discussed in}} a two-dimensional photonic square lattice, in which four topological <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> split out naturally after the touching of two bands with different parity. The emergence of such <b>nodal</b> <b>points,</b> characterized by vortex structure in momentum space, is attributed to the unavoidable band crossing protected by mirror symmetry. The topological nodes can be unbuckled through breaking the mirror symmetry and a photonic Chern insulator can be achieved through time reversal symmetry breaking. The joint effect of breaking time reversal symmetry and breaking inversion symmetry is further found to strengthen the finite size effect, providing ways to engineer helical edge states...|$|R

500|$|After the September 11, 2001 attacks, {{with about}} 100 pages of Pattern Recognition written, Gibson had to re-write the main character's backstory, {{which had been}} {{suddenly}} rendered implausible; he called it [...] "the strangest experience I've ever had {{with a piece of}} fiction." [...] He saw the attacks as a <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> in history, [...] "an experience out of culture", and [...] "in some ways... the true beginning of the 21st century." [...] He is noted {{as one of the first}} novelists to use the attacks to inform his writing.

500|$|The September 11, 2001 {{attacks are}} used as a motif {{representing}} a {{break with the past}} with Cayce's father, who disappears during the attacks, as the personification of the 20th century. Gibson viewed the attacks as a <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> after which [...] "nothing is really the same". One reviewer commented that in [...] "Gibson's view, 9-11 was the end of history; after it we are without a history, careening toward an unknown future without the benefit of a past—our lives before 9-11 are now irrelevant." [...] Cayce's search for her father and Damien's excavation of the German bomber symbolize the historicist search for a method to interpret people's actions in the past. Coming to terms with her father's disappearance may be interpreted as a requiem for those lost to the 20th century, something that may have been influenced by Gibson {{coming to terms with the}} loss of his own father.|$|E
500|$|Sociocultural {{changes in}} post-September 11 America, {{including}} a resurgent tribalism and the [...] "infantilization of society", first {{appeared as a}} prominent motif in Gibson's thought with Pattern Recognition.

[...] The result saw Gibson noted {{as one of the first}} novelists to use the attacks to inform their writing. Nathan Lee in The Village Voice advanced the notion that while Pattern Recognition [...] focused to an extent on [...] "specifying the ambient sense of invasiveness in all aspects of life after the collapse of the towers", Spook Country accepted that anxiety as a premise, and was thus [...] "the more reflective, less unnerving of the two novels".|$|E
40|$|We generalize {{the concept}} of triply-degenerate <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> to non-collinear antiferromagnets. Here, we {{introduce}} this concept to insulating quantum antiferromagnets on the decorated honeycomb lattice, with spin-$ 1 $ bosonic quasiparticle excitations known as magnons. We demonstrate the existence of magnonic surface states with constant energy contours that form pairs of magnonic arcs connecting the surface projection of the magnonic triple <b>nodal</b> <b>points.</b> The quasiparticle excitations near the triple <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> represent three-component bosons beyond that of magnonic Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line cases. They {{can be regarded as}} a direct reflection of the intrinsic spin carried by magnons. Furthermore, we show that the magnonic triple <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> can split into magnonic Weyl points, as the system transits from a non-collinear spin structure to a noncoplanar one with a nonzero scalar spin chirality. Our results not only apply to insulating antiferromagnets, but also provide a platform to seek for triple <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> in metallic antiferromagnets.

40|$|Streamlines and {{distributions}} of <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> {{are used as}} signatures of chaos in coherent electron transport through three types of billiards, Sinai, Bunimovich and rectangular. Numerical averaged distribution functions of nearest distances between <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> are presented. We find the same form for the Sinai and Bunimovich billiards and {{suggest that there is}} a universal form that {{can be used as a}} signature of quantum chaos for electron transport in open billiards. The universal distribution function is found to be insensitive to the way avaraging is performed (over positions of leads, over an energy interval with a few conductance fluctuations, or both). The integrable rectangular billiard, on the other hand, displays nonuniversal distribution with a central peak related to partial order of <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> for the case of symmetric attachment of leads. However cases with nonsymmetric leads tend to the universal form. Also it is shown how <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> in rectangular billiard can lead to "channeling of quantum flows" while disorder in <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> in the Sinai billiard gives rise to unstable irregular behavior of the flow.

2500|$|The {{grain of}} a {{photographic}} mosaic has just as limited resolving power as the [...] "grain" [...] of the retinal mosaic.

A key factor of obtaining detailed vision, however, is inhibition. This is mediated by neurons such as the amacrine and horizontal cells, which functionally render the spread or convergence of signals inactive. This tendency to one-to-one shuttle of signals is powered by brightening of the center and its surroundings, which triggers the inhibition leading to a one-to-one wiring. This scenario, however, is rare, as cones may connect to both midget and flat (diffuse) bipolars, and amacrine and horizontal cells can merge messages just as easily as inhibit them.|$|E
