40|$|The main {{process of}} the onion post harvest {{treatment}} is drying proces. High moisture content of onion leaf and outer layer of onion must be reduced up to moisture content 12 % or below (wet basis). This level keeps onion being still fresh. The conventional drying with direct sunlight still has been widely used because of the cheap process. However, this technique needs too long <b>drying</b> <b>time</b> as well as climate dependency. This research evaluated convective dryer for onion leaf drying. The mass transfer coefficient, and moisture diffusivity was estimated to predict effective <b>drying</b> <b>time.</b> Results show that the <b>drying</b> <b>time</b> was shorter as the temperature and air velocity increased. For example, at 60 oC and air velocity 0. 5 m. s- 1, the <b>drying</b> <b>time</b> was about 19 hours. The <b>drying</b> <b>time</b> can be can be 5 hours shorter at higher air velocity. In addition, with increase of air velocity, the <b>drying</b> <b>time</b> can be also speeded up, significantly.

Currently, the carrageenan drying still deals with too long <b>drying</b> <b>time.</b> This because, during the process carrageenan and water forms gel stucture in which hampers the water diffusion to the surface.

In this study, the carrageenan was mixed with egg white to form foam that can break the gel and create the pore for improving the surface area. The carrageenan and egg white mixture was then dried at different air temperature and humidity.

SAP-to-maize ratios between 1 : 1 and 1 : 5 showed little or no aflatoxin contamination after drying to the optimal moisture content (MC) of 13 %, while for ratios 1 : 10 and 1 : 20, aflatoxin contamination was not well controlled due to the overall higher MC and <b>drying</b> <b>time,</b> which made these ratios unsuitable for the drying process.

In order to investigate the effect of dryer parameters on milling quality of rice and their relationships, one of the usual rice varieties (Binam) of Gilan province with an average milling quality and the initial moisture content of 20. 5 % was selected. Drying process was performed on the basis of a complete randomized design with 20 treatments and 3 factors including temprature (at five levels of 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 °C), air velocity (at two levels of 0. 5 and 2 m/s) and final moisture content of paddy (at two levels of 10. 5 % and 14 % on wet basis equal to 11. 7 % and 16. 3 % on dry basis respectively).
