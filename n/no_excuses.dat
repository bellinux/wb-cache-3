25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. I thought {{this was the best}} way to win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. We never got the starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, but I have <b>no</b> <b>excuses</b> to offer.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Gatorade re-branded {{a number}} of its products. Original Gatorade was {{initially}} re-labeled as Gatorade G. Gatorade Rain was re-labeled as <b>No</b> <b>Excuses.</b> Gatorade AM was re-labeled Shine On; Gatorade X-Factor was relabeled as Be Tough; and Gatorade Fierce was relabeled Bring It. However these names were short-lived, as a two-percent decline in market share in 2009 led to a broader repositioning of the entire line in 2010. Beginning in February 2010, the Gatorade product portfolio was re-positioned around what the company {{refers to as the}} G Series, categorizing varieties of its products into three main segments: before, during, and after athletic events.|$|E

25|$|Aldikacti’s initial {{challenge}} was with GM's corporate structure, which split its engineers into two categories: the car engineers who would create blueprints for the car, and manufacturing engineers who {{would work out}} the fabrication and assembly issues. Fiero blueprints traveled {{back and forth between}} the two engineering branches, using up time and money. Aldikacti was forced to sit the two teams of engineers down next to one another, allowing for <b>no</b> <b>excuses</b> to why there was “no build” after his design was done. Many modifications in the Fiero’s production needed to be made; for instance, despite his long-standing interest in manufacturing body panels from plastic, Aldikacti consented to metal body pieces, the dies for which were much less costly.|$|E
500|$|In the post-game press conference, Josh Wicks {{discussed}} his ejection, saying: [...] "It {{was a mistake}} on my part and I've got to learn my lesson. The fourth official made a call and the ref made the final decision. That was it. I've got <b>no</b> <b>excuses</b> for it. Tremendously, very, very disappointing." [...] One month after the stomping incident, U.S. Soccer announced that Wicks would be suspended from the U.S. Open Cup tournament for five matches.|$|E

Yet his dislike of bureaucracy and his crude speech often made him well liked by many under his command.|$|E

500|$|On July 21, 2000, Santos {{defended the}} welterweight {{championship}} against Giovanni Parisi in Calabria, Italy. Santos won the fight by knockout {{in the fourth}} round. Following the fight Parisi stated that the welterweight championship was always his interest as he wanted {{to become the first}} Italian to win world championships in three different divisions. In this interview he claimed that his training prior to the fight was insufficient. Giovanni said: [...] "We battled in Reggio Calabria, a coin toss from Sicily, and he KOed me during the 4th round.

Hilson's produced the vocals, which were recorded by Bryan Jones at <b>No</b> <b>Excuses</b> Studio in Santa Monica, California with assistance from Bryan Morton. The recordings were later mixed by Jean Marie Horvat. Perry and Titus Jackson played keyboards on the song, and Thomas Drayton contributed guitars. The song {{is one of three}} tracks on In a Perfect World... that Hilson did not co-write. The song was used in a viral commercial prior to the album's release in March 2009, and was later sent for urban adult contemporary airplay on June 23, 2009, as the fifth single from the album.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to these comments, Carina MacKenzie of Zap2it stated, [...] "We're left wondering if Safran missed the part where she went home bleeding because Chuck was using physical intimidation to release his own emotions." [...] While reviewing the episode, Tierney Bricker of Zap2it felt that there were [...] "really <b>no</b> <b>excuses</b> for Chuck Bass anymore." [...] MacKenzie concluded that Chuck's behavior throughout [...] fit the signs of an abusive relationship, citing examples from HelpGuide.org, a non-profit health resource. She noted Chuck's public humiliation of Blair, his attempt to pawn her during a business deal, and his use of physical intimidation. MacKenzie also called the show's explanation [...] "disturbing, particularly given the young, female target demographic of Gossip Girl and The CW." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2017, PewDiePie {{used the}} racial slur [...] "nigger" [...] while live-streaming PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. As a {{response}} to the incident, Campo Santo co-founder Sean Vanaman referred to PewDiePie as [...] "worse than a closeted racist", announced that Campo Santo would file copyright strikes against PewDiePie's videos featuring the studio's game Firewatch, and encouraged other game developers to do the same. PewDiePie later uploaded a short video apologizing for the language he used during the live-stream, expressing [...] "I'm not going to make any excuses to why it did because there are <b>no</b> <b>excuses</b> for it.

The outsider Priestholme set off at an unsustainably fast pace, followed by Isinglass, with Watts restraining Ladas towards the rear. Priestholme dropped away in the straight, leaving Isinglass in the lead with Watts moving Ladas up to challenge. The two Derby winners dominated the race in the closing stages {{but in spite of}} a [...] "game pursuit", Ladas was unable to overhaul Isinglass, who won by a length {{with the rest of the}} field, headed by Throstle, well beaten. There were <b>no</b> <b>excuses</b> for Ladas: Watts admitted that he had been beaten by a better horse.|$|E

However, part of her could {{appreciate}} that Hilson does what she wants and that she is confident enough to do it. Concepcion further stated: [...] "Then I watched the above interview she did with Perez Hilton, {{and it made me}} respect her even more. She stood her ground and made <b>no</b> <b>excuses</b> for her words or her visuals, and I can dig that." [...] Niki A. M. of Vibe wrote that Hilson [...] "made quite tails wag with her titillating video" [...] and that [...] "men reeled over the scantily clad vixen gyrating and shouting sexplicit phrases like [...] "fuck me" [...] while females seethed in disappointment over her crotch shots that went viral just days ago." [...] Becky Bain, writing for Idolator, stated that [...] "the stilted dialog between Hilson and Columbus Short {{near the end of the}} mini-movie as well as the former's delivery makes the scene come off like the beginning of a porn movie, and unsurprisingly, the scene ends much like a porn movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Clinkscales often plays streetball {{with the}} Sean Bell All-Stars against local teams in New York City, {{acting as the}} {{starting}} point guard. The team was named after an unarmed New York native who was shot 50 times by three police officers on November 25, 2006. The Sean Bell All-Stars won the Trayvon Martin Invitational in August 2013, with a team that featured Clinkscales and Tobias Harris, in Harlem, New York. The event raised over $5,000 for the Trayvon Martin Foundation and was attended by NBA players Kyrie Irving, Tyreke Evans, and future NBA commissioner Adam Silver. At the invitational, Clinkscales spoke out against police brutality, saying, [...] "Kids everywhere are getting shot and murdered, whether it's in Jamaica, the Bronx, Chicago. It seems like it never goes right {{when it comes to the}} law, but the message to the kids is that if you go hard on the court you have to go hard in the classroom." [...] In 2015, he competed for the All-Stars at The Basketball Tournament, in a team that featured Delroy James and Zamal Nixon and was managed by Raheem Wiggins. In a victory against Team <b>No</b> <b>Excuses</b> in 2015, Clinkscales scored 11 points. As well as playing streetball, he coaches youth basketball in South Jamaica, Queens.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the storyline {{which saw}} Kyla's Alcoholics Anonymous {{companion}} Stuart McElroy (Conor Mullen) violently attack her colleague, Ward Sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), Ayola has stated: [...] "It makes her finally accept what Stuart was capable of. She sees this huge gash and feels that all her instincts {{about other people}} are wrong – so she ends up running off. [...] has <b>no</b> <b>excuses</b> – all she can think is that she’s really messed up and needs to leave." [...] This plot strand saw Kyla once more resort to drinking while at work, and decide to quit her job, only to be talked out of doing so by Nursing Consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell). [...] Ayola explained: [...] "He suggests she takes a demotion, so she’ll have less to worry about and more {{time to deal with}} her problems. It's the lifeline she needs, because her work is all she has right now. I think if Kyla did leave, she’d end up simply going home and buying loads of cheap booze." [...] When asked if Kyla would be able to overcome her addiction and regain custody of her son, Ayola responded: [...] "I hope so. Kyla's had trouble being a good parent to Max, but she's had lots of time to reflect on why this is." ...|$|E

500|$|California Chrome had {{a tumultuous}} four-year-old season. The horse began 2015 at Santa Anita in the San Antonio Stakes on February 7, a return matchup with Shared Belief, whose traffic {{problems}} in the Classic prevented a true match against California Chrome. Art Sherman and Shared Belief's trainer, Jerry Hollendorfer, were longtime friends and rivals from the Northern California racing circuit, and each anticipated the rivalry between their two horses. Sherman said, [...] "I just want both of us {{to be at the}} head of the stretch with <b>no</b> <b>excuses</b> and then it's who gets to the wire first." [...] Shared Belief went off as the favorite, and although California Chrome took the lead by the [...] pole, Shared Belief edged him in the final sixteenth and won, with California Chrome second by a length and a half. [...] California Chrome next shipped to Meydan Racecourse for the Dubai World Cup on March 28, where he needed to run at night, under artificial lighting, and without Lasix. He went off as the favorite but finished second to the Irish-bred longshot Prince Bishop, owned by Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum of Godolphin Racing. Sherman noted that his horse ran wide on the turns but said, [...] "He tried every inch of the way. There's nothing wrong with finishing second in this type of a race." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{connections}} next entered {{him in the}} Santa Anita Handicap, {{nicknamed the}} [...] "Big 'Cap", on March 8, returning to California rather than shipping him overseas {{to run in the}} $10 million Dubai World Cup later that month, again stating that they considered it to be best for the horse. [...] With the announcement that Will Take Charge was also coming to California, the 2014 race became the most highly anticipated running since the matchup of Alysheba and Ferdinand in 1988, the only other time that the previous year's Breeders' Cup top two finishers returned to challenge one another at the Santa Anita Handicap. [...] Additional interest came from the return of Game On Dude, who won the Big 'Cap in 2011 and 2013. [...] Mucho Macho Man was assigned the highest [...] at [...] Will Take Charge was assigned [...] and Game on Dude, [...] Eight horses entered, with Mucho Macho Man the morning line favorite. Game On Dude, described as [...] "on fire" [...] that day, won the race and broke the stakes record in doing so, Will Take Charge was second, but Mucho Macho Man started to lose energy at the [...] three-eighths pole and finished fourth behind Blingo. Ritvo had <b>no</b> <b>excuses</b> for his finish, noting only that he had missed a few training days due to rain, and the extra moisture had also changed the condition of the Santa Anita track. [...] On May 1, 2014, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal proclaimed Mucho Macho Man Day in the state of Georgia, recognizing the accomplishments of the horse and the attention he and his owners brought to Georgia.|$|E
