40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} problem of preparing good-quality social network data for data analysis and mining. Modern online social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn have rapidly grown in popularity. The consequent availability of a wealth of social network data provides an unprecedented opportunity for data analysis and mining researchers to determine useful and actionable information {{in a wide variety}} of fields such as social sciences, marketing, management, and security. However, raw social network data are vast, noisy, distributed, and sensitive in nature, which challenge data mining and analysis tasks in storage, efficiency, accuracy, etc. Many mining algorithms cannot operate or generate accurate results on the vast and messy data. Thus social network data preparation deserves special attention as it processes raw data and transforms them into usable forms for data mining and analysis tasks. Data preparation consists of four main steps, namely data collection, data cleaning, data reduction, and data conversion, each of which deals with different challenges of the raw data. In this dissertation, we consider three important problems related to the data collection and data conversion steps in social network data preparation. The first problem is the sampling issue for social network data collection. Restricted by processing power and resources, most research that analyzes user-generated content from social networks relies on samples obtained via social network APIs. But the lack of consideration for the quality and potential bias of the samples reduces the effectiveness and validity of the analysis results. To fill this gap, in the first work of the dissertation, we perform an exploratory analysis of data samples obtained from social network stream APIs to understand the representativeness of the samples to the corresponding complete data and their potential for use in various data mining tasks. The second problem is the privacy protection issue at the data conversion step. We discover a new type of attacks in which malicious adversaries utilize the connection information of a victim (anonymous) user to some known public users in a social network to re-identify the user and compromise identity privacy. We name this type of attacks connection fingerprint (CFP) attacks. In the second work of the dissertation, we investigate the potential risk of CFP attacks on social networks and propose two efficient k-anonymity-based <b>network</b> <b>conversion</b> algorithms to protect social networks against CFP attacks and preserve the utility of converted networks. The third problem is the utility issue in privacy preserving data conversion. Existing k-anonymization algorithms convert networks to protect privacy via modifying edges, and they preserve utility by minimizing the number of edges modified. We find this simple utility model cannot reflect real utility changes of networks with complex structure. Thus, existing k-anonymization algorithms designed based on this simple utility model cannot guarantee generating social networks with high utility. To solve this problem, in the third work of this dissertation, we propose a new utility benchmark that directly measures the change on network community structure caused by a <b>network</b> <b>conversion</b> algorithm. We also design a general k- anonymization algorithm framework based on this new utility model. Our algorithm can significantly improve the utility of generated networks compared with existing algorithms. Our work in this dissertation emphasizes the importance of data preparation for social network analysis and mining tasks. Our study of the sampling issue in social network collection provides guidelines for people to use or not to use sampled social network content data for their research. Our work on privacy preserving social <b>network</b> <b>conversion</b> provides methods to better protect the identity privacy of social network users and maintain the utility of social network data...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The {{research}} was conducted {{by means of a}} study of literature and empirical methods. The literature study demonstrated that CSTs (Control System Trips) are very critical throughout the project life cycle in the chemical industry. There is however, a lack of engineering management interaction throughout the different phases, as well as effective front end loading and knowledge of CSTs. Knowledge gained from the literature study as well as personal experience, insight and practical knowledge of this field of engineering management were used to construct a plan that can be used throughout all the different phases of a project in the chemical industry herein referred to as the CSTMP (Control System Trip Management Plan) in South Africa. The CSTMP was developed for each different phase of a project. The plan covers all reviews, tests, interface management, engineering management, and risk management, end of job / phase documentation, and so forth. The researcher submits that the CSTMP constitutes the issue of the new knowledge that he has contributed to the science of Engineering Management. The CSTMP is developed in detail in Chapter 4 of this work. The CSTMP was applied to the Nigel PPS (Pressure Protection Station) project for evaluation. The CSTMP was not used until the basic engineering phase and calculated assumptions were made to compute the possible loss in cost. The Nigel PPS project was part of the natural gas <b>network</b> <b>conversion</b> project. The project consisted of the conversion of the Gauteng network from hydrogen-rich gas to natural gas from Mozambique. The total cost of the conversion was R 373 million and it was successfully completed in June 2004. It is estimated that by implementing the plan, 4. 7 % of the cost could have been saved. The CSTMP was validated by means of several questionnaires, completed by control system engineers as well as by technologists and technicians. The aim of the questionnaires was to determine their knowledge regarding the importance of CSTs during project phases. The CSTMP was tested by means of two additional questionnaires which were issued to a dedicated group of engineering managers. The first questionnaire was analysed to determine the engineering managers' knowledge and competence. The second questionnaire was issued after a presentation on the CSTMP to determine the engineering managers' knowledge and acceptance of the CSTMP. The resulting data were statistically analysed and documented to confirm that the CSTMP will indeed make a contribution to the chemical industry in South Africa. The problem statement addressed by this thesis states that projects in the chemical industry are executed without due cognisance of the engineering management of CSTs, causing rework, unsafe conditions, insufficient front end loading and no continuity in resources. It is crucial that an effective CSTMP is maintained throughout project phases for each new or refurbished project. The CSTMP could be applied to non-chemical plants in the industry. The lack of a well structured and integrated CST management plan is a root cause of the lack of engineering management effort with respect to CST Management. The following main conclusions were drawn {{as a result of this}} work: • Engineering managers should take cognisance of the requirements of a CSTMP and should implement such as part of their risk management accountability. The CSTMP will help engineering managers to understand and consequently, accept accountability for CSTs during all the different phases of a project. • There will be a definite cost saving if a formal CSTMP is implemented during a project. Rework will be cut to a minimum and actions will follow in a logical sequence during each phase of a project. This was measured on a single project and could not be executed on several different types of projects, due to time and practical constraints. The CSTMP will also improve the front end loading of a project, due to better management. • The CSTMP will ensure continuity across identified project phases. The plan will also highlight the importance of the CSTs on all the phases of a project. This enables the control systems engineer to become involved earlier in a project in identifying possible risks as well as continuity during the FAT (Factory Acceptance Test). During the FAT, all designs are integrated into a dedicated system, interfaces are clarified and training (operation and maintenance) finalised. An effective FAT will ensure a quicker and safer startup of a plant. Doctora...|$|E
