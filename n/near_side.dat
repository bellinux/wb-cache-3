5|$|The {{concentration}} of maria on the <b>Near</b> <b>Side</b> likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, {{which may have}} formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few {{tens of millions of}} years after their formation.|$|E
5|$|The Fra Mauro {{formation}} (or Fra Mauro Highlands) is a selenological formation on the <b>near</b> <b>side</b> of Earth's Moon {{that served}} as the landing site for the American Apollo 14 mission in 1971. It is named after the 80-kilometer-diameter crater Fra Mauro, located within it. The formation, as well as Fra Mauro crater, take their names from a 15th-century Italian monk and mapmaker of the same name. Apollo 13 was originally scheduled to land in the Fra Mauro highlands, but was unable due to an in-flight technical failure.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation with Earth, always {{showing the}} same face, with its <b>near</b> <b>side</b> marked by dark volcanic maria that fill {{the spaces between}} the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. As seen from the Earth, it is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky, after the Sun. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance just slightly {{higher than that of}} worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.|$|E

5|$|This crater {{was named}} after Ernest Henry Shackleton, an Anglo-Irish {{explorer}} of Antarctica from 1901 {{until his death in}} 1922. The name was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1994. Nearby craters of note include Shoemaker, Haworth, de Gerlache, Sverdrup, Slater, and Faustini. Somewhat farther away, on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar <b>near</b> <b>side,</b> are the larger craters Amundsen and Scott, named after two other early explorers of the Antarctic continent.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 4th century, the Empire had become chronically {{deficient}} in raising sufficient troops from amongst its own population. As an alternative, taxation raised internally was increasingly used to subsidise {{growing numbers of}} barbarian recruits. The Romans had, for some time, recruited individual non-Roman soldiers into regular military units. In 358AD, this practice was accelerated by the wholescale adoption of the entire Salian Franks people into the Empire, providing a ready pool of such recruits. In return for being allowed to settle as foederatii in northern Gallia on the <b>near</b> <b>side</b> of the Rhine, the Franks were expected to defend the Empire's borders in their territory and provide troops to serve in Roman units.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} Marlborough {{the rest of}} the van had mixed success. HMS Bellerophon and HMS Leviathan were both still {{suffering}} the effects of their exertions earlier in the week and did not breach the enemy line. Instead they pulled along the <b>near</b> <b>side</b> of Éole and America respectively and brought them to close gunnery duels. Rear-Admiral Thomas Pasley of Bellerophon was an early casualty, losing a leg in the opening exchanges. HMS Royal Sovereign, Graves's flagship, was less successful due to a miscalculation of distance that resulted in her pulling up too far from the French line and coming under heavy fire from her opponent Terrible. In the time it took to engage Terrible more closely, Royal Sovereign suffered a severe pounding and Admiral Graves was badly wounded.|$|E

5|$|From September 1610, Galileo {{observed}} that Venus exhibited {{a full set}} of phases {{similar to that of the}} Moon. The heliocentric model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the Sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. On the other hand, in Ptolemy's geocentric model it was impossible for any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally, the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the <b>near</b> <b>side</b> of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was, however, also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases of Venus, therefore, this Ptolemaic model became untenable. Thus in the early 17th century, as a result of his discovery, the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models, such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models, each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all had the virtue of explaining the phases of Venus without the vice of the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.|$|E
5|$|From {{before midnight}} on 27 March, the tired 12th Brigade {{had been holding}} the railway line between Albert and Dernancourt, having {{relieved}} the 9th (Scottish) Division. The forward positions of the salient held by the 12th Brigade were along the railway line, which ran along a series of embankments and cuttings, up to but not including a railway bridge immediately northwest of Dernancourt where the Dernancourt–Laviéville road passed under the railway. A mushroom-shaped feature known as the Laviéville Heights overlooked the railway line, which curved around its foot. This was difficult ground to defend, particularly where the railway line curved and skirted the northwestern corner of Dernancourt, as if the line there was overrun, the enemy {{would be able to}} fire into the rear of the troops lined out along the railway in both directions. Despite this, the Australian commanders considered it important to hold the railway line; if it was not garrisoned, the enemy could assemble in the dead ground behind the embankment. A further difficulty arose from the fact that if an attack occurred during daylight, it would be almost impossible to move troops down the exposed slopes to reinforce the railway line without crippling losses, and troops withdrawing from the railway line would be similarly exposed. To afford them some protection along the railway line, the forward posts dug one-man niches in the <b>near</b> <b>side</b> of the embankment, but the only way for them to fire was to climb up and lie on top of the embankment, thus exposing themselves to enemy fire.|$|E

25|$|The Panorama Elite II range {{built on}} the success of the Panorama I and Panorama Elite. The front grill was squared up {{although}} it still used the same twin headlight layout. The first bay on the <b>near</b> <b>side</b> was tidied up so the top of the window was in line with all the other side windows. Parcel racks were redesigned so the supply of fresh air and light output was more readily available. The service units were now mounted front to back instead of side to side and were much slimmer to maximize on headroom when leaving the seats. Crash padding was provided along the inner side of the racks in the form of black PVC squares filled with padding. The dashboard was again improved as was the front cabinet. The rear of the vehicle still used the soup plates from the previous range.|$|E

25|$|Before the team's next {{match at}} NYRB, Andrea Mancini was {{released}} {{to join the}} New York Cosmos, freeing up an international roster slot, and allowing the team to activate Kamara, who had sat out over six weeks with a hamstring injury. Without Acosta, United seemed hopelessly overmatched by the potent NYRB in a match scheduled to honor the 15th anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Indeed, the Red Bulls went ahead {{in the first half}} following a Nyarko defensive turnover that led to a historic goal by Bradley Wright-Phillips, giving BWP the most goals over a 3-year stretch by any player in league history. In the second half, Wright-Phillips caught Hamid leaning towards the far post and slammed it past him to the <b>near</b> <b>side,</b> giving NY a 2-0 lead. The New York team only turned up the pressure, but Hamid responded with multiple highlight reel saves to keep his team in the match. In the 89th minute, a loose ball in the box came to Birnbaum, and he delivered with a shot that narrowed the gap to 2-1. Then, in the 5th minute of stoppage time, a loose ball in the box came to Neagle for an easy tap-in, and United emerged with a shocking draw against the run of play.
