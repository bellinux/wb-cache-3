She had begun the project with the intent that her longtime ranch manager, Angela Alvarez, would operate the horse breeding program after Varian was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>able</b> to do so, and then once Alvarez was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>able</b> to run the ranch, the property would be gifted to the Trust to be sold, the conservation easement running with the land, and attempts made to find a buyer that would also be interested in maintaining the Arabian horse breeding program.|$|E

5|$|Nittany Furnace, known earlier as Valentine Furnace, was a {{hot blast}} iron furnace located in Spring Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States.

5|$|Once in Buenos Aires, Castelli {{found himself}} in {{political}} isolation. The triumvirate and the newspaper La Gazeta blamed him for the defeat at Huaqui, and sought punishment as a deterrent. His former supporters were divided between those who supported {{the ideas of the}} Triumvirate and those <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>able</b> to help. Castelli suffered from tongue cancer during the long trial, which made it progressively more difficult for him to speak. He died on October 12, 1812, while the trial was still underway.|$|E
5|$|Polyphenols, {{which often}} have {{antioxidant}} properties in vitro, {{are not necessarily}} antioxidants in vivo due to extensive metabolism. In many polyphenols, the catechol group acts as electron acceptor and is therefore responsible for the antioxidant activity. However, this catechol group undergoes extensive metabolism upon uptake in the human body, for example by catechol-O-methyl transferase, and is therefore <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>able</b> to act as electron acceptor. Many polyphenols may have non-antioxidant roles in minute concentrations that affect cell-to-cell signaling, receptor sensitivity, inflammatory enzyme activity or gene regulation.|$|E

5|$|By 1963, {{following}} some 15 {{years of}} unrelenting {{pressure from the}} police and the ABC, Stoumen decided he was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>able</b> financially to sustain the fight. The cost of his long legal battle was more than $38,000. Sarria tried to enlist the owners of the city's other gay bars to help Stoumen pay his legal bills, but none offered any assistance. The ABC lifted the bar's liquor license in 1963, the night before its annual Halloween party. After a final defiant Halloween celebration at which only non-alcoholic beverages were served and an attempt to survive on food and soft drink sales, the Black Cat closed down for good in February 1964.|$|E
5|$|By July 2011, Rohrer had {{submitted}} a beta {{version of the}} game for Nintendo approval. This was followed up with the master version in October. An issue raised during the approval process was Rohrer's desire to credit Bailey on the game's cover, which Nintendo rejected. He got around this by officially naming the game Jason Rohrer with Music by Tom Bailey: Diamond Trust of London. In May 2012, the game was ready for manufacturing. However, due to changing market conditions, Zoo Publishing was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>able</b> to afford the manufacturing of cartridges given the large minimum order of 6,000 units that Nintendo required, and so, Rohrer turned to the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.|$|E

The group toured together and recorded a five song demo, but after a while Horvath and Norborg were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>able</b> to tour due to schooling. Elmore recruited friend and ex-Moreno guitarist/singer Sean Hulet, ex-Moreno drummer Scott Rosenquist, and ex-Andiamo bassist Joel Root. The new group completed a tour of the East Coast.|$|E
5|$|In September 1785, the Barbaulds left Palgrave {{for a tour}} of France; Rochemont's {{mental health}} had been deteriorating and he was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>able</b> {{to carry out his}} {{teaching}} duties. In 1787, they moved to Hampstead, where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel. It was here that Barbauld became close friends with Joanna Baillie, the playwright. Although no longer in charge of a school, the Barbaulds did not abandon their commitment to education; they often had one or two pupils living with them, who had been recommended by personal friends.|$|E
5|$|Jack Mann bought Kona Lanes in 1980 and re-branded it New Kona Lanes the {{following}} year.

He also owned Tustin Lanes before selling it to his youngest son, Alex. Mann bought Kona not because he loved bowling, but because it would continue to pay dividends if he was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>able</b> to work. He later sold Kona to his son Jack Jr.|$|E

Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February.
