Also, an automated weather observation system (AWOS) was installed at these airports to enable air-carrier use of the new <b>non-precision</b> GPS instrument <b>approach</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|R
40|$|Pre-defined curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> {{represent}} an essential for noise abatement and {{may reduce the}} risk of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) for today’s aviation considerably. In addition, a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) supports accuracy and precision of the desired flight path. While the lateral guidance during current curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> is usually based on a position solution provided by satellite navigation systems in conjunction with inertial navigation systems, the vertical guidance is still based on measurements of a barometric altimeter. This type of approach with vertical guidance is supposed to enhance the situational awareness for pilots compared to <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> and reduce the risk for controlled flight into terrain. However, the accuracy of the barometric vertical guidance is inferior compared to precision <b>approach</b> <b>procedures,</b> temperature dependent and require the correct pressure setting for each approach in the aircraft. Therefore, novel curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> are supposed to rely solely on satellite navigation augmented by either a ground based or satellite based system and only optionally by inertial measurement systems. Such coupled (hybrid INS and GNSS) systems are usually highly integrated and monitored by a flight management system. Therefore, the requirements for the equipment of aircraft that are conducting such <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> are very stringent. Using only GBAS could relax those requirements. In this work, an option for precision curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> was investigated and tested in flight trials. This option is based on a GBAS. In general, different possibilities are imaginable to enable GBAS based curved approaches. For instance, GBAS could only serve as means to enhance the navigation performance to achieve stringent RNP requirements. Or GBAS could serve as the sole means to enable a curved approach. This option is described in this paper. Others include the Microwave Landing System or are conducted as a visual approach. The option which utilizes the GBAS functionality to broadcast desired (curved) flight paths, the Terminal Area Path (TAP) functionality was investigated in this work. For this, simulator trials were performed to evaluate different means of flying these procedures in terms of guidance displacement sensitivity and means of displaying deviation information. Based on the results of the simulator trials flight trials were conducted. Results from flight trials are presented in this manuscript to show how this method for conducting curved approaches can be applied...|$|R
50|$|The crew {{initially}} executed the VOR/DME <b>non-precision</b> instrument <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> to runway 02. Upon becoming visual, {{the crew}} {{determined that the}} aircraft was not adequately aligned with the runway and initiated a missed approach. A change in wind direction now favoured the opposite runway, so the aircraft was positioned for an ILS (Instrument Landing System) approach to runway 20. The aircraft descended below cloud and became visual with the runway at around 500 ft above ground level. At a late stage in the final approach, the airfield lighting failed for a few seconds. The aircraft touched down hard, bounced, and made a second heavier touchdown causing substantial damage to the nosewheel and its supports. This caused further damage to the aircraft systems, including loss of electrical power, interference with controls and an uncommanded increase in thrust.|$|R
40|$|Presently, {{precision}} {{approaches of}} aircraft to airports with vertical and lateral guidance are only conducted as straight in approaches {{with a single}} glide path, mostly using VHF radio navigation technology. Here, the final approach track is usually several kilometers long (10 nautical miles) and cannot be changed due to the linear propagation of radio signals. Using the technology of augmented Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS) this final approach path can be made more flexible with several curved and straight segments with different vertical profiles in order to enable a safe descent with vertical guidance also in mountainous terrain, around obstacles or for noise abatement. Currently, a special type of laterally guided curved approaches is already implemented in very few places. This type of <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> is called Required Navigation Performance Authorization Required and is usually only available for specially approved operators. Here, the lateral guidance during the approach is usually based on a position solution provided by satellite navigation systems in conjunction with inertial navigation systems and the vertical guidance is still based on measurements of a barometric altimeter. This type of approach with vertical guidance is supposed to enhance the situational awareness for pilots compared to <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> (no vertical guidance) and reduce the risk for controlled flight into terrain. However, {{the accuracy of the}} barometric vertical guidance is inferior compared to precision <b>approach</b> <b>procedures,</b> temperature dependent and requires the correct pressure setting for each approach in the aircraft. Therefore, novel curved <b>approach</b> <b>procedures</b> should rely solely on satellite navigation augmented by either a ground based or satellite based system and only optionally by inertial measurement systems. When augmentation systems provide additional accuracy and integrity improvements, a vertical component of the position can be computed. Together with a predefined path, this highly accurate position solution can enable curved approaches with a vertical glide path guidance down to the required minimum obstacle clearance (200 ft above ground). Using a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) at the airport, one or more Terminal Area Paths (TAP) could be broadcast to provide precision guidance to aircraft maneuvering in the terminal area. Such a use of the system would allow the provision of multiple curved approaches to multiple runway ends with only one ground installation and as such save cost to the airport and airline operator whilst providing the added benefit of noise abatement and enhanced obstacle clearance. The transmission of multiple curved or segmented steep approaches enables approaching aircraft to select the approach path most suitable for the given situation. An experimental GBAS station was installed at the research airport in Braunschweig. Data processing complied with the currently proposed requirements to support automatic landings. Corrections for GPS measurements and integrity parameters were sent to a research aircraft which was equipped with an experimental GPS receiver providing raw measurement data. The received data and measurements were then processed on board in real-time and provide approach guidance information to the experimental pilot in form of a flight director indication. To evaluate system performance the authors create a truth reference track from a post processed carrier phase solution. Finally, the GBAS outputs and the received ILS signals are compared to the truth reference. The system performed well within all specifications and showed full availability at all times during the flight. Compared to ILS, GBAS is significantly more precise and shows almost no nois...|$|R
50|$|Missed {{approach}} point (MAP or MAPt) is {{the point}} prescribed in each instrument approach at which a missed <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> shall be executed if the required visual reference does not exist. It defines the point for both precision and <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches</b> wherein the missed approach segment of an <b>approach</b> <b>procedure</b> begins. A pilot must execute a missed approach if a required visual reference (normally the runway or its environment) is not in sight upon reaching the MAP or the pilot decides it is unsafe {{to continue with the}} approach and landing to the runway.

50|$|The use of GNSS in {{aircraft}} {{is becoming}} increasingly common. GNSS provides very precise aircraft position, altitude, heading and ground speed information. GNSS makes navigation precision once reserved to large RNAV-equipped aircraft available to the GA pilot. Recently, more and more airports include GNSS instrument approaches.

50|$|If {{a runway}} has both {{precision}} and <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches</b> defined, the MDA of the <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> {{is almost always}} greater than the DH/DA of the precision approach, {{because of the lack}} of vertical guidance on the non-precision approach: the actual difference depends on the accuracy of the navaid upon which the approach is based, with ADF approaches and SRAs tending to have the highest MDAs.|$|R

50|$|The {{official}} {{finding of}} the NTSB {{was that the}} probable cause of the accident was the stalling of the airplane (airspeed too low) because the captain failed {{to ensure that the}} flight remained within the required airspeed and altitude parameters for that <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> profile.

50|$|A concept {{related to}} the missed {{approach}} point is the visual descent point, or VDP. Determination of its location {{is done by the}} designers of the instrument <b>approach</b> <b>procedure,</b> but typically this is a point on the final approach course of a <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach,</b> from which the aircraft would be able to continue its descent from the MDA to the runway threshold while maintaining a standard 3° descent angle while being assured obstacle clearance. In other words, usually it is the point (on the profile view of the approach) where a line depicting a 3° descent angle would intercept the horizontal line at the MDA. If the pilot does not have the required visual reference to continue the descent from the MDA at this point, he/she must continue to fly at or above the MDA, and the rapidly steepening descent angle required to complete a successful landing on the runway means that a safe and successful approach becomes less likely.|$|R
