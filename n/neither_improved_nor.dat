40|$|Forecasting {{the world}} economy is a {{difficult}} task given the complex interrelationships within and across countries. This paper proposes a number of approaches to forecast short-term changes in selected world economic variables and aims, first, at ranking various forecasting methods in terms of forecast accuracy and, second, at checking whether methods forecasting di- rectly aggregate variables (direct approaches) out-perform methods based on the aggregation of country- specific forecasts (bottom-up approaches). Overall, all methods perform better than a simple benchmark for short horizons (up to three months ahead). Among the forecasting approaches used, factor models appear to perform the best. Moreover, direct approaches out-perform bottom-up ones for real variables, but not for prices. Finally, when country-specific forecasts are adjusted to match direct forecasts at the aggregate levels (top-down approaches), the forecast accuracy is <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> deteriorated (i. e. top-down and bottom-up approaches are broadly equivalent in terms of country-specific forecast accuracy) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When {{constructing}} biologically inspired algorithms, important {{properties to}} consider are openness, diversity, interaction, structure and scale. In this paper, {{we focus on}} the property of diversity. Introducing diversity into biologically inspired paradigms is a key feature of their success. Within the field of Artificial Immune Systems, little {{attention has been paid to}} this issue. Typically, techniques of diversity introduction, such as simple random number generation, are employed with little or no consideration to the application area. Using function optimisation as a case study, we propose a simple immune inspired mutation operator that is tailored to the problem at hand. We incorporate this diversity operator into a well known immune inspired algorithm, aiNet. Through this approach, we show that it is possible to improve the search capability of aiNet on hard to locate optima. We further illustrate that by incorporating the same mutation operator into aiNet when applied to clustering, it is observed that performance is <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> sacrificed. ...|$|E

The study had a single group pretest- posttest design and enrolled 64 community-dwelling older people with dementia; 6 -month follow-up data were available for 32 participants. The falls-prevention programme was embedded in a healthy lifestyle dementia respite programme, which combined day respite with preventative health programmes. A comprehensive falls risk assessment was conducted for each client to develop an individualised falls and injury management plan that included a tailored exercise programme to improve strength and balance. Outcome measurements were fall status, cognitive function (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE), balance (Berg Balance Scale, BBS) and aerobic capacity (6 -minute walk test).

40|$|Short chain {{fatty acids}} (SCFAs) {{produced}} by intestinal microbes mediate anti-inflammatory effects, but whether they impact on antimicrobial host defenses remains largely unknown. This {{is of particular}} concern {{in light of the}} attractiveness of developing SCFA-mediated therapies and considering that SCFAs work as inhibitors of histone deacetylases which are known to interfere with host defenses. Here we show that propionate, one of the main SCFAs, dampens the response of innate immune cells to microbial stimulation, inhibiting cytokine and NO production by mouse or human monocytes/macrophages, splenocytes, whole blood and, less efficiently, dendritic cells. In proof of concept studies, propionate <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> worsened morbidity and mortality parameters in models of endotoxemia and infections induced by gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Candida albicans. Moreover, propionate did not impair the efficacy of passive immunization and natural immunization. Therefore, propionate has no significant impact on host susceptibility to infections and the establishment of protective anti-bacterial responses. These data support the safety of propionate-based therapies, either via direct supplementation or via the diet/microbiota, to treat non-infectious inflammation-related disorders, without increasing the risk of infection...|$|E

Exploiting a unique longitudinal dataset of Chinese enterprises, our study reports that the foreign equity percentage, the number of foreign partners in the JV interacted with enterprise age, and relative labor intensity are important determinants of foreign buyouts. Although simple difference-in-differences estimates show that foreign buyouts yield an immediate negative impact on firm profitability rates and a sustained positive impact on firm profits relative to the industry mean, alternative propensity score matching methodology demonstrates that these results are biased and misleading.

40|$|Abstract Short-term {{consumption}} of a high-fat diet impairs exercise capacity in both rats and humans, and increases {{expression of the}} mitochondrial uncoupling protein, UCP 3, in rodent cardiac and skeletal muscle via activation of the transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Unlike long-chain fatty acids however, medium-chain fatty acids do not activate PPARα and do not increase muscle UCP 3 expression. We therefore investigated exercise performance and cardiac mitochondrial function in rats fed a chow diet (7. 5 % kcal from fat), a long-chain triglyceride (LCT) rich diet (46 % kcal from LCTs) or a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) rich diet (46 % kcal from MCTs). Rats fed the LCT-rich diet for 15 days ran 55 % less far than they did at baseline, whereas rats fed the chow or MCT-rich diets <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> worsened in their exercise capacities. Moreover, {{consumption of}} an LCT-rich diet increased cardiac UCP 3 expression by 35 % and decreased oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, whereas consumption of the MCT-rich diet altered neither UCP 3 expression nor oxidative phosphorylation efficiency.

The results suggest that the CTbased ultrasound templates can improve the localization of the prostate bed when the initial displacements are greater than 4 mm. For initial displacements smaller than 4 mm, the technique <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> worsened target localization. However, ultrasound alignments performed without the use of a template deteriorated patient positioning for two out of three patients, demonstrating that the use of a CT template was beneficial even at small initial displacements...|$|E

40|$|The surface {{properties}} of an object, such as texture, glossiness or colour, provide important cues to its identity. However, the actual visual stimulus {{received by the}} eye is determined by both {{the properties of the}} object and the illumination. We tested whether operational colour constancy for glossy objects (the ability to distinguish changes in spectral reflectance of the object, from changes in the spectrum of the illumination) was affected by rotational motion of either the object or the light source. The different chromatic and geometric properties of the specular and diffuse reflections provide the basis for this discrimination, and we systematically varied specularity to control the available information. Observers viewed animations of isolated objects undergoing either lighting or surface-based spectral transformations accompanied by motion. By varying the axis of rotation, and surface patterning or geometry, we manipulated: (i) motion-related information about the scene, (ii) relative motion between the surface patterning and the specular reflection of the lighting, and (iii) image disruption caused by this motion. Despite large individual differences in performance with static stimuli, motion manipulations <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> degraded performance.

Moreover, it can be observed that for the 7 th and 8 th bit-planes (the least significant bits), the quality of the extracted logo is <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> affected when using this method because of the small length of the range (the lengths of the 7 th and 8 th bit-plane are 2 and 1 respectively); therefore, there is no middle value, and the watermarked pixel is {{on the edge of the}} range.

IVP showed impaired kidney and ureter of various degree within one month but majority of cases returned to normal or improved in six months. A few numbers of cases <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> changed even after six months. No death due to renal insufficiency was encountered. Method of anastomosis {{was found to be}} closely related with occurrence of entero-ureteric reflux, ascending infection and renal impairment. Leadbetter's technique, which we have used, has several points to be improved, because rather high incidence of ascending infection (50 %) was seen despite low incidence of entero-ureteric reflux (one case). Ascent of urine to the upper intestinal tract was not beyond the left flexure in twelve cases and to the right flexure in one case. The residual volume ranged 1 / 3 to 1 / 5 of the infused solution of 300 ml. No relationship was observed between the residual urine and acidosis. Postanastomotic morphological changes of the intestine did not seem to cause impairment of evacuation of feces and urine.

40|$|PURPOSE: Subjects with {{albinism}} usually {{suffer from}} nystagmus and reduced visual acuity, which may impair reading performance. The contribution of nystagmus to decreased reading ability is not known. Low vision and nystagmus {{may have an}} additive effect. We aimed {{to address this question}} by motion compensation of the nystagmus in affected subjects and by simulating nystagmus in healthy controls. METHODS: Reading speed and eye movements were assessed in 9 subjects with nystagmus associated with albinism and in 12 healthy controls. We compared the reading ability with steady word presentation and with words presented on a gaze contingent display where words move in parallel to the nystagmus and thus correct for the nystagmus. As the control, healthy subjects were asked to read words and texts in steady reading conditions as well as text passages that moved in a pattern similar to nystagmus. RESULTS: Correcting nystagmus with a gaze contingent display <b>neither</b> <b>improved</b> <b>nor</b> reduced the reading speed for single words. Subjects with nystagmus and healthy participants achieved comparable reading speed when reading steady texts. However, movement of text in healthy controls caused a significantly reduced reading speed and more regressive saccades. CONCLUSIONS: Our results argue against nystagmus as the rate limiting factor for reading speed when words were presented in high enough magnification and support the notion that other sensory visual impairments associated with albinism (for example reduced visual acuity) might be the primary causes for reading impairment...|$|E
40|$|Rule-Based Forecasting (RBF) is {{an expert}} system that uses {{judgment}} to develop and apply rules for combining extrapolations. The judgment comes from two sources, forecasting expertise and domain knowledge. Forecasting expertise is based on {{more than a half}} century of research. Domain knowledge is obtained in a structured way; one example of domain knowledge is managers = expectations about trends, which we call “causal forces. ” Time series are described in terms of 28 conditions, which are used to assign weights to extrapolations. Empirical results on multiple sets of time series show that RBF produces more accurate forecasts than those from traditional extrapolation methods or equal-weights combined extrapolations. RBF is most useful when it is based on good domain knowledge, the domain knowledge is important, the series is well behaved (such that patterns can be identified), there is a strong trend in the data, and the forecast horizon is long. Under ideal conditions, the error for RBF’s forecasts were one-third less than those for equal-weights combining. When these conditions are absent, RBF <b>neither</b> <b>improves</b> <b>nor</b> harms forecast accuracy. Some of RBF’s rules can be used with traditional extrapolation procedures. In a series o...|$|R

40|$|Background There is {{conflicting}} information about whether nitrate treatment aggravates long-term prognosis, so the present retrospective {{study was designed}} {{to determine the effects of}} long-term nitrate therapy on major adverse events after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the coronary interventional era. Methods and Results Using the Japanese Acute Coronary Syndrome Study database, 1, 236 consecutive patients who were hospitalized within 48 h of onset of symptoms of AMI from January to December 2003 were evaluated. All-cause mortality, cardiac events and cardiovascular events were lower in patients treated with nitrates than in the untreated controls. However, these crude comparisons included several confounding factors on nitrate prescription. To minimize the effect of selection bias on outcomes, the technique of propensity score matching for clinical characteristics was used and distortion of effective nitrate treatment was excluded as much as possible. The results of propensity score matching showed that nitrate therapy had no impact on all-cause mortality, cardiac events and cardiovascular events at 30, 60 or 90 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years follow-up. Conclusions Long-term nitrate therapy after AMI <b>neither</b> <b>improves</b> <b>nor</b> aggravates prognosis. Prospective randomized clinical trials are warranted to determine the effects of long-term nitrate therapy for secondary prevention of AMI. (Circ J 2007; 71 : 301 - 307) 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R
