5|$|As {{the green}} flag flew on lap 38, Chip Ganassi Racing held a one–two with Franchitti leading Dixon, {{with two of}} the Dreyer & Reinbold cars—Conway and Wilson—holding third and fourth places, with the only {{remaining}} KV car of E. J. Viso holding fifth, the Venezuelan disposing of Castroneves just after the restart. Realising that the gamble had backfired, the lead quintet pitted on laps 41 and 42, which cycled Hunter-Reay back through to the lead. Power made an error which allowed Matos and Briscoe to move ahead of him. Briscoe moved ahead of Matos on lap 45 and set off in chase of Hunter-Reay. Four laps later, the Australian was on the American's tail, and moved ahead after an outbraking move into the final hairpin. Hunter-Reay immediately regained the position into the first chicane on Lap 51, before Briscoe sealed the place with a similar final hairpin move {{at the end of the}} lap. Briscoe's luck would run out, however, when he overcooked it into turn five on lap 54, and nudged the barriers with his <b>nose</b> <b>assembly,</b> bringing out the fourth and final caution of the race. The time limit meant that only six laps remained at the restart, with Hunter-Reay leading Power, Matos, Meira and Wheldon. Meira soon passed his fellow Brazilian for third on Lap 57, and began to chase down the lead duo, who had changed positions after Power used the slipstream to overtake Hunter-Reay into the final corner. Power moved away from Hunter-Reay in the final laps, taking the chequered flag to cap his return from injury with a victory. Hunter-Reay took his best result for a year in second, with another injury returnee, Meira, finishing third. Matos was fourth, holding off seven other cars, as fourth to eleventh were covered by 3.49 seconds at the race's conclusion. Wheldon led those seven in fifth, ahead of the Ganassis, Conway, Castroneves, Kanaan and Wilson. Viso finished twelfth ahead of top rookie Beatriz, a recovering Briscoe, Danica Patrick and de Silvestro, the final two off the lead lap.|$|E

40|$|EXPERT is {{a mission}} to gather precise {{in-flight}} data of the re-entry aerothermodynamic environment [1]. That led to {{the selection of a}} ceramic matrix composite heat shield as the Thermal Protection System (TPS) for the nose of the vehicle. The Instrumented <b>Nose</b> <b>Assembly</b> (NAP) is a sub-system of the EXPERT vehicle, consisting of the ceramic matrix composite (CMC) nose and embedded payloads to measure temperature, heat flux and spectroscopic data. Since EXPERT is a vehicle with a high ballistic coefficient the aerodynamic pressure in the stagnation area reaches a value of 1. 5 bar. During re-entry the peak heat flux will reach up to 1. 8 MW/m² and the predicted temperatures will reach up to 2050 °C in the capsule front. Due to the very large temperature gradients between hot surface and internal cold structures the problem of mismatching thermal expansion has to be solved. At the same time the nose has to withstand the high pressure loads. The paper describes the design of the nose and the load introductions attaching the nose to the vehicle. The thermo-mechanical analyses as well as mechanical tests of the load introduction are presented...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our recent}} {{efforts in the}} integration of thick plate polycrystalline chemical vapor deposited (CVD) diamond into Stationary Plasma Thruster channel for improved wear resistance. Prior tests on laboratory Hall discharges indicated that CVD diamond has significant erosion resistance compared to the more commonly used boron nitride ceramics. Here, we extend our studies further, and have designed and have carried out preliminary tests of a diamond replacement nose cone on a commercial, space-qualified, BHT- 200 low power Hall thruster. A preliminary performance test verified that {{the introduction of the}} diamond nose cone resulted in nearly identical levels of thrust, efficiency, and specific impulse, within experimental uncertainty. The operation on diamond resulted in a minor increase in current, most likely due to the rougher shape of the diamond test <b>nose</b> cone <b>assembly,</b> or of the use of an alumina fastener for mating the assembly to the central pole piece of the thruster. Future diamond assemblies will consist of diamond plates that are brazed together for improved mechanical and thermal performance. In parallel, we have developed and performed initial vibration testing of brazed diamond plates, to verify the mechanical integrity of the proposed (brazed) diamond <b>nose</b> cone <b>assembly.</b> Broadband sine-sweep testing at 1 / 3 gRMS of two 6. 1 mm × 5. mm × 1 mm brazed diamond plates showed a nearly rigid frequency response over the range of 20 - 2000 Hz, with some resonances at higher frequencies, outside of the normal environmental testing range. Extended vibrations at 20 Hz, and at 3. 7 gRMS showed no noticeable shifts or degradation in the frequency response of the structure...|$|R

40|$|The EXPERT mission aims at {{collecting}} precise in-flight data during atmospheric re-entry. For {{this purpose}} a vehicle was envisaged {{that is designed}} especially for that. Almost twenty payloads are on board of the EXPERT capsule which has {{the shape of a}} cone with a blunt nose. Four non-moveable flaps are located {{at the end of the}} capsule. The nose of the vehicle is made from a ceramic matrix (CMC) composite material. In the nose four exciting experiments are situated. Payload 1 is a Flush Air Data System that measures the pressure and the heat flux in five positions on the nose. Payload 2 collects temperature date on the inside of the ceramic nose at six locations via pyrometric measurements. Payload 10 is a spectrometer that investigates the chemical properties of the boundary layer around the nose via an optical window in the nose. Palyoad 11 is an experiment that deals with the catalycity of materials in the region of the interface of the nose to the adjacent metallic Thermal Protection System (TPS) of the capsule.

40|$|The EXPERT {{program is}} a {{re-entry}} mission to gather in-flight data of the aerothermodynamic environment. The EXPERT NAP (Instrumented <b>Nose</b> <b>Assembly)</b> is a sub-system of the EXPERT vehicle. The nose is the essential hot structure component {{at the front of}} the EXPERT vehicle to protect the vehicle internal from aerothermodynamic heat loads. The ceramic matrix composite (CMC) nose cap system, which has to withstand the extreme thermal loads during re-entry, is designed and manufactured using DLR’s C/C-SiC material. The behaviour of this material and especially all NAP components out of this material had to be tested under the EXPERT trajectory conditions. The RESPECT (payload of the IRS, University Stuttgart) and RAFLEX (payload of HTG) payloads are using ceramic sensor head (SH) bolts. These bolts will be positioned in the ceramic nose cap and are exposed to the plasma in the stagnation area. In the centre of the bolts is a hole that serves the purpose of pressure measurement (RAFLEX) and optical access to the plasma (RESPECT). System samples were integrated into a wind tunnel probe for testing them in the LBK plasma wind tunnel facility. The LBK facility at DLR in Cologne was used to create the required test environment. During various tests the behaviour of the material as well as the influence of hole and bolt edge was investigated. With the measured data, especially the ones of the RAFLEX system samples, a discussion will be performed focussed on the effect of a drill hole or a circular edge on the nose and the payload performance.

Earlier incidents included another JetBlue flight bound for New York City, a United Airlines flight into Chicago, and an America West flight into Columbus, Ohio.

40|$|A {{series of}} flight tests was {{conducted}} to evaluate the reduction of takeoff ground roll distance obtainable from a rapid extension of the nose gear strut. The NASA Quiet Short-haul Research Aircraft (QSRA) used for this investigation is a transport-size short takeoff and landing (STOL) research vehicle with a slightly swept wing that employs the upper surface blowing (USB) concept to attain the high lift levels required for its low speed, short-field performance. Minor modifications to the conventional <b>nose</b> gear <b>assembly</b> {{and the addition of}} a high pressure pneumatic system and a control system provided the extendible nose gear, or 'jump strut,' capability. The limited flight test program explored the effects of thrust-to-weight ratio, storage tank initial pressure, and control valve open time duration on the ground roll distance. The data show that the predicted reduction of takeoff ground roll on the order of 10 percent was achieved {{with the use of the}} jump strut. Takeoff performance with the jump strut was also found to be essentially independent of the pneumatic supply pressure and was only slightly affected by control valve open time within the range of the parameters examined...|$|R
40|$|Damaged {{components}} of the <b>nose</b> wheel <b>assembly</b> of an aircraft were sent to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed damages to all {{components of}} the assembly to various extents. The starboard bearing was severely damaged and the outer race had cracked. Correspondingly, the orifice of the starboard half of the hub was also severely damaged and it got enlarged. Evidences suggest that the axial load on the bearings grossly exceeded the design load leading to fracturing of the outer race of the starboard bearing and its dislodgement. The axial load was such that the wheel hub moved on the axle towards right. The damages seen on the port bearing is negligible, because in this case, the wheel hub moved along with the bearing and the outer race {{could come out of}} the bearing without any obstruction. The movement of the outer race in this case was similar to that during dis-assembly of any conical bearing. Analysis showed that the failure in the bearings is secondary in nature and it appears to have occurred due to excessive axial load. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|R

Also superplastic forming is a net-shape processing technology that dramatically decreases fabrication and assembly costs by reducing the number of parts and the assembly requirements. Using SPF technology. It was anticipated that a 50% manufacturing cost reduction can be achieved for many aircraft assemblies, such as the nose cone and <b>nose</b> barrel <b>assemblies.</b> Other spin-offs include weight reduction, elimination of thousands of fasteners, elimination of complex featuring and a significant {{reduction in the number of}} parts.

The maximum likelihood output error method is used with a steady-state Kalman filter incorporated to account for atmospheric turbulence. A modified Newton-Raphson search technique, enhanced by a line search, is employed for parameter identification. Separate algorithms are developed for estimating the biases and noise levels in the observations. Some areas of practical problems {{in the application of}} such methods are stressed.
