40|$|A long-standing {{problem in}} climate models {{is the large}} sea surface {{salinity}} (SSS) biases in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> In this study, we describe the influences of correcting these SSS biases on the circulation of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> {{as well as on}} <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector mean climate and decadal to multidecadal variability. We performed integrations of the Kiel Climate Model (KCM) with and without applying a freshwater flux correction over the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> The quality of simulating the mean circulation of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector mean climate and decadal variability is greatly enhanced in the freshwater flux-corrected integration which, by definition, depicts relatively small <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SSS biases. In particular, a large reduction in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> cold sea surface temperature bias is observed and a more realistic Atlantic Multidecadal Variability simulated. Improvements relative to the non-flux corrected integration also comprise a more realistic representation of deep convection sites, sea ice, gyre circulation and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The results suggest that simulations of <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector mean climate and decadal variability could strongly benefit from alleviating sea surface salinity biases in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> which may enhance the skill of decadal predictions in that region...|$|R

It is a complex 'see-saw' between two pressure systems located over Greenland {{and a group of}} Islands known as the Azores. The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation is most pronounced during the winter season and accounts for more than one third of the total variance in sea level pressure. The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation is closely related to the position of the storm track. During a positive phase of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation the average storm track moves across the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> in a <b>North</b> Easterly direction towards Europe and the United Kingdom, During a negative phase of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation, the storm track moves in a West to East direction towards Southern Europe.

40|$|The {{influences}} of <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> biases on multiyear predictability of unforced surface air temperature (SAT) variability are {{examined in the}} Kiel Climate Model (KCM). By employing a freshwater flux correction over the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> to the model, which strongly alleviates both <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) biases, the freshwater flux-corrected integration depicts significantly enhanced multiyear SAT predictability in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector {{in comparison to the}} uncorrected one. The enhanced SAT predictability in the corrected integration is due to a stronger and more variable Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and its enhanced influence on <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST. Results obtained from preindustrial control integrations of models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) support the findings obtained from the KCM: models with large <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> biases tend to have a weak AMOC influence on SAT and exhibit a smaller SAT predictability over the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector...|$|R
40|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) observations in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> indicate {{the existence of}} strong multidecadal variability with a unique spatial structure. It is shown {{by means of a}} new global climate model, which does not employ flux adjustments, that the multidecadal SST variability is closely related to variations in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> thermohaline circulation (THC). The close correspondence between the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST and THC variabilities allows, in conjunction with the dynamical inertia of the THC, for the prediction of the slowly varying component of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> climate system. It is shown additionally that past variations of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> THC can be reconstructed from a simple <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST index and that future, anthropogenically forced changes in the THC can be easily monitored by observing SSTs. The latter is confirmed by another state-of-the-art global climate model.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sea surface temperatures (SST) and persistent drought in North America using modern observations, proxy paleodata, and simulations from multiple climate models. The observational results show that persistent droughts in the Great Plains and the southwest North America {{are closely related to}} multidecadal variations of <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations, AMO). During the AMO warm (cold) phases, most of North America is dry (wet). This relationship is persistent since at least 1567 AD, as based on proxy SST for the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and the reconstructed drought index for North America. On centennial timescales, proxy SST records from the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and proxy drought records for North America suggest that major periods of AMO-like warm (cold) SST anomalies during the last 7. 0 ka correspond to dry (wet) conditions in the Great Plains. The influence of <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST on <b>North</b> American droughts is examined using simulations made by five global climate models. When forced by warm <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST anomalies, all models captured significant drying over North America, despite some regional differences. Specifically, dry summers in the Great Plains and the southwest North America are simulated by all models. The precipitation response to a cold <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> is much weaker and contains greater disagreement among the models. Overall, the ensemble of the five models could well reproduce the statistical relationship between the dry/wet fluctuations in the North America and <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST anomalies. Our results suggest that <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SSTs are likely a major driver of decadal and centennial timescale circulation, including droughts, in North America. Possible mechanisms that connect <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST with <b>North</b> American drought, as well as interactions between <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and tropical Pacific SST and their relative roles on drought are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} that {{the correlation between}} the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation (NAO), in terms of the NAO index, and the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sea surface temperature (SST) is not stationary. This is inferred from both reanalysis data from the U. S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) and the Kaplan sea surface temperature data set. Two phases of winterly <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> atmosphere-ocean covariability are identified by means of linear regression and correlation analysis. During the recent decades since the late 1960 s/early 1970 s and during the first 3 decades of the twentieth century, the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> SST is strongly correlated to the regional atmospheric circulation in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sector, i. e., the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Oscillation.
