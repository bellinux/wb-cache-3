50|$|In 2006, Kathy Padgett, William Bales and Thomas Bloomberg {{conducted}} a well-controlled, large scale evaluation of 75,661 Florida offenders placed on home detention from 1998 to 2002. , {{a small percentage}} of whom were made to wear an electronic monitoring device, which allowed comparison between those who were electronically monitored and those who were not. The study controlled for factors thought to influence {{the success or failure of}} community supervision: the type of placement, type of electronic monitoring device (GPS or radio frequency), criminal history, offender characteristics, type of primary offence committed by each offender, court- ordered conditions of supervision, the number of weeks absconded, weeks in treatment etc. with a total of 62 variables. The researchers incorporated time-varying independent variables in the estimation of maximum-likelihood coefficients, and also applied proportional-hazards survival analysis to adjust for right-censoring. As of 2010, compared to other studies, <b>no</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> of electronic monitoring controlled such an array of variables nor involved such a large sample.|$|E
