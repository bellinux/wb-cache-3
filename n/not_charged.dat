5|$|On 8 September 1994 the DoD {{announced}} the actions {{it would take}} {{in response to the}} investigation's findings. May was charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide by military legal authorities. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson were charged with dereliction of duty. All of those charged faced an Article 32 hearing in which it would be decided if they should be tried by court-martial or the matter disposed of otherwise. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson faced a joint Article 32 hearing while May's hearing was separate. Wickson was <b>not</b> <b>charged.</b> Although not explicitly stated by USAF leaders, it appears that Wickson was <b>not</b> <b>charged</b> but May was because Wickson had testified that he was sure of his identification of the two Black Hawks as hostile Hinds, while May had stated that he was not sure of Wickson's identification but had allowed the engagement to proceed anyway.|$|E

5|$|Promotional {{activities}} halted after G-Dragon {{tested positive}} for marijuana. Though a urine test back in August came back negative, a weak positive for marijuana was detected from testing the content of his hair in October. Since {{it was his first}} recorded offence with a minuscule amount of the drug, it resulted in an indictment and he was <b>not</b> <b>charged.</b> He later claimed to have accepted an offered cigarette from a fan in Japan during a party back in May, but after realizing it was not a normal cigarette, threw it away. Because he was <b>not</b> <b>charged,</b> he did not lose any endorsers and made his first public appearance after the scandal at the 2011 MTV EMAs with his group.|$|E

5|$|Himmler {{joined the}} Nazi Party (NSDAP) in August 1923; his Party number was 14,303. As {{a member of}} Röhm's {{paramilitary}} unit, Himmler {{was involved in the}} Beer Hall Putsch—an unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. This event would set Himmler on a life of politics. He was questioned by the police about his role in the putsch, but was <b>not</b> <b>charged</b> because of insufficient evidence. However, he lost his job, was unable to find employment as an agronomist, and had to move in with his parents in Munich. Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members.|$|E

However, if an accurate throw is made in time to complete a double play or triple play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, an error may be charged.|$|E
