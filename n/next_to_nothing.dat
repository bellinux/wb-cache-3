The Byzantines then resorted to organizing a plot within the Norman army, spearheaded by the officers Peter of Aulps, Renaldus, and William, who were accused of attempting to defect. In the early winter of 1082, Alexios managed to obtain a mercenary force of 7,000 soldiers from the Seljuq Turkish sultan Suleiman ibn Qutulmish.

25|$|Anne of Brittany's second {{marriage}} making her Queen Consort of France {{continued into the}} 16th century; and she died in 1514. Queen Claude of France, reigned as duchess of Brittany from 1514, but under her husband king Francis {{was not able to}} maintain an independent government in the Duchy of Brittany. Claude's son Francis I was invested as duke of Brittany. But this act meant <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>nothing</b> to advance Breton independence. Some members of the House of Penthièvre were appointed as royal governors of Brittany by the French. Their failure to reassert their Ducal rights successfully hastened the merger of the Ducal crown into the Kingdom of France. At this time the title Duke of Brittany began to lose independent sovereign status and began to become only titular in character; the Breton region lost independence and became a province of France.|$|E

Meade suggested that Davis wanted to have a Louisianan in his Cabinet, but that a smarter course of action would have been to send Benjamin abroad to win over the European governments.

Yet, it has to be said, there is something refreshing about being ten weeks away from a giant blockbuster and knowing <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>nothing</b> about it." [...] To distract investigative fans from the film's title during filming, five fake titles were registered with the Motion Picture Association of America; The City of Gods, The Destroyer of Worlds, The Fourth Corner of the Earth, The Lost City of Gold and The Quest for the Covenant.

40|$|Tokyo is a {{city that}} is unique. It {{possesses}} a culture where the traditional and the modern stand side by side, accentuating one another. My design for an Izakaya and a Karaoke Bar represents this characteristic of Tokyo city. The traditional, seen in the Japanese Izakaya restaurant is expressed through the function of the building as well as the inclusion of traditional Japanese design elements - low rise, a pitched roof and the use of timber as the primary material for the structure and cladding. On the other hand, the Karaoke Bar which stands <b>next</b> <b>to</b> it is <b>nothing</b> but traditional. The seven-storey Karaoke Bar expresses the fun and playful nature of its function through colourful pods and open balconies that house its singing occupants. The structural components of the building include a concrete load bearing wall located at the rear which acts as the back bone to the structure, whilst a metal frame with fiberglass tubes house the karaoke pods {{at the front of the}} building. People walking along the street will be able to look up and see the fun and excitement occurring inside the pods.

However, Hinson also wrote a positive statement about Ariel, saying it was [...] "refreshing... to see a heroine who has some sense of what she wants and the resources to go after it". Nell Minow of Common Sense Media had a mixed view of Ariel, praising her for being [...] "adventuresome, rebellious, and brave" [...] but also criticizing that she [...] "gives up everything– her family, her home, her voice– for love, even though her trust in the sea witch puts everyone she loves in danger".

He felt the film was a [...] "Hollywood-movie triumph that blacks could have used more of during – and since – that era." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, lightly criticized Parker's direction, commenting that the film was [...] "sordid fantasy" [...] being [...] "trained on the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, and the feast for the self-righteous that emerges {{has little to do with}} history, sociology, or even common sense." [...] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "...like the South African saga Cry Freedom, it views the black struggle from an all-white perspective. And there's something of the demon itself in that. It's the right story, but with the wrong heroes."
