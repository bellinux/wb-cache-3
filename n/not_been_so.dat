5|$|Three years later, in 1876, Colorado {{became a}} state. At the time {{settlement}} had pushed as far west from its capital, Denver, as Leadville. There was {{a variety of}} metals and minerals in the surrounding mountains, and some miners had become rich from their claims there. Those who had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> successful heard about reports from prospectors of abundant silver deposits further west, over the Divide.|$|E
5|$|As in 1905, the cyclists {{were divided}} in two categories, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur {{machines}} poinçonnées, where the riders {{in the first}} category were allowed to change bicycles, which could be an advantage in the mountains, where they could use a bicycle with lower gears. In 1905, sponsors had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> enthusiastic about entering their cyclists in this category, but in 1906 they had learned {{that it had a}} commercial advantage to have cyclists starting in the poinçonnées category, because the average French citizen could identify more with them. In 1906, {{more than half of the}} cyclists started in the poinçonnées category, including Lucien Petit-Breton, one of the pre-favourites.|$|E

25|$|The hammer-headed bat is one {{of three}} species of African fruit bat that are thought to serve as {{reservoirs}} for the Ebola virus.

25|$|The 5th Cavalry Division had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> badly {{affected}} by sickness {{and was able}} to continue the pursuit as it had garrisoned Afulah and Nazareth well away from the mosquito infested areas along the Jordan River. Nor were they involved in the fighting at Jisr Benat Yakub, when they were in reserve to the Australian Mounted Division. Allenby now ordered the 5th Cavalry Division to advance to Homs while the 4th Cavalry Division, which barely had enough men to carry out normal camp duties, remained to garrison the Zahle-Rayak-Baalbek area.|$|E
25|$|Then on 21 April, off Cape St. Nicholas in San Domingo, Reindeer {{captured}} the French privateer schooner Creole. She was pierced for 14 guns but only mounted six, not including swivel guns. She had {{a crew of}} 59 and had put another 16 men on prizes. Creole {{had a reputation for}} being the fastest vessel in those waters; Fyffe believed that he would not have caught her if Creole's captain had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> confident that he could outrun Reindeer that he tried to cut in front of her bow to gain the wind. Reindeer also destroyed another small privateer of two guns. The crew, however, escaped.|$|E

Two mainland Chinese women visiting Taipei decided to do their dance in the hotel lobby, attracting attention from guests there and causing friction with hotel management.

25|$|Many {{of these}} damaged pagodas {{underwent}} restorations in the 1990s {{by the military}} government, which sought to make Bagan an international tourist destination. However, the restoration efforts instead drew widespread condemnation from art historians and preservationists worldwide. Critics are aghast that the restorations {{paid little attention to}} original architectural styles, and used modern materials, and that the government has also established a golf course, a paved highway, and built a 61-meter (200-foot) watchtower. Although the government believed that the ancient capital's hundreds of (unrestored) temples and large corpus of stone inscriptions were more than sufficient to win the designation of UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> designated, allegedly mainly on account of the restorations.|$|E
25|$|Judge Debra Ann Livingston {{wrote for}} a panel that {{took two years}} to decide the case. It found that while that act was constitutionally protected, the {{balancing}} test established by Pickering v. Board of Education actually improved the MTA's case under Mt.

Even if it had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> disruptive, the court held, his record of insubordination and deception of several of the defendants was enough reason for him to have been disciplined and fired—indeed he had even admitted he believed his job to be in jeopardy before he had contacted the Times.|$|E

25|$|When {{thirteen}} {{of these}} colonies rebelled, entering {{a war of}} secession, the strong bonds of blood, commerce, and history meant that most Bermudians sympathised with the rebels. It is entirely probable that, if Bermuda had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> remote from the continental coastline, and had the Royal Navy not enjoyed near supremacy on the ocean, Bermuda {{would have been the}} fourteenth colony to join the rebellion. As this was not possible, Bermudians initially assisted the colonists by selling them Bermuda sloops via neutral ports to use as privateers. The number is unclear, but seems to have been very many, with British authorities reporting up to a thousand, although this number is clearly impossible given other sources state the number of ships built in Bermuda during the entire century numbered a thousand. Some historians state that the Bermudian-built privateers played a decisive role in the Americans achieving independence. With trade between the rebelling colonies {{and the rest of the}} Empire banned by both sides, Bermudians were faced with the threat of starvation, as well as the destruction of their trade. The Americans were dependent on Bermuda for salt, which the islanders offered the rebels in exchange for food. The Americans insisted on receiving gunpowder. Benjamin Franklin and Henry Tucker Sr. (a colonel of the Bermuda Militia, and a former President of the Privy Council, whose son, Henry Tucker, was then President of the Privy Council and son-in-law to Governor Breure, and whose other two sons were a colonel in the Virginia Militia and a politician in the rebel administration), orchestrated the theft of a hundred barrels of gunpowder from a magazine in St. George's, which was supplied to the Americans. Following this, the Continental Congress authorised trade with Bermuda (although this trade remained illegal in Bermuda).|$|E
500|$|Following a {{brief period}} of {{training}} at Liverpool and Ingleburn, the battalion took part in a farewell march through Sydney. The Sydney Morning Herald of 4 January 1940 gave an account of their farewell march: [...] "The long khaki columns thrilled the hearts of Sydney as it had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> moved for {{a quarter of a century}} since that still, spring day in 1914 when the first A.I.F. marched through the same streets on its way to Anzac and imperishable glory; the marching was magnificent." [...] Afterwards, the battalion sailed in the first troop convoy to leave Australia on 10 January 1940, embarking upon the transport Orcades. They disembarked at El Kantara on the Suez Canal on 14 February 1940, and from there they were trucked to their camp at Julis in Palestine, where they undertook further training.|$|E

Lee, however, felt the number was an odd choice to demonstrate their talent, and although Slezak graded it a [...] "B", he contrasted it negatively with their previous duets. West opined that the song was too insubstantial {{and gave it a}} [...] "B–". Its highest grade, an [...] "A–", came from Benigno.

500|$|The {{arrival of}} humans {{on the island}} 1,500 to 2,000years ago has taken a {{significant}} toll, {{not only on the}} size of lemur populations, but also on their diversity. [...] Due to habitat destruction and hunting, at least 17species and 8genera have gone extinct and the populations of all species have decreased. [...] A couple of species once thought to have gone extinct have since been rediscovered. [...] The hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) was only known from five museum specimens, most collected in the late 19th century and one in 1965. [...] It was rediscovered in 1989 and has since been identified in five national parks, although it is very rare within its range. [...] Likewise, the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) was thought to be extinct as recently as the late 1970s, but a population was located near Ranomafana National Park in the late 1980s. [...] Historically, it had a much wider geographic distribution, shown by subfossil remains, but today it remains one of the world's 25 most endangered primates. [...] One distinctive morph (possibly a species or subspecies) of sifaka, has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> fortunate, having been extirpated from all known localities. [...] Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.|$|E
