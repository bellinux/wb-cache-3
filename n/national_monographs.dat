40|$|Introduction. Bird cherry Padus avium Mill, Rosaceae, is {{widespread}} in Ukraine, especially in forests and foreststeppe areas. Bird cherry fruits {{have long been}} used in medicine and is a valuable medicinal raw materials. They stated to posess astringent, anti-inflammatory, phytoncidal properties. Bird cherry fruits {{are included in the}} USSR Pharmacopoeia IX ed., The State Pharmacopoeia of the Russian Federation, The State Pharmacopoeia of Republic of Belarus. In Ukraine there are no contemporary normative documents for this medicinal plant material, therefore it is the actual to develop projects in the <b>national</b> <b>monographs</b> "dry bird cherry fruit" and "fresh bird cherry fruit" {{to be included in the}} State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine. According to European Pharmacopoeia recommendation method of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is prescribed only for the identification of the herbal drug. The principles of thinlayer chromatography and application of the technique in pharmaceutical analysis are described in State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine. As it is effective and easy to perform, and the equipment required is inexpensive, the technique is frequently used for evaluating medicinal plant materials and their preparations. The TLC is aimed at elucidating the chromatogram of the drug with respect to selected reference compounds that are described for inclusion as reagents. Aim of this study was to develop methods of qualitative analysis of bird cherry fruits for a monograph in the State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine (SPU). Materials and Methods. The object of our study was dried bird cherry fruits (7 samples) and fresh bird cherry fruits (7 samples) harvested in 2013 - 2015 in Kharkiv, Poltava, Luhansk, Sumy, Lviv, Mykolaiv regions and the city Mariupol. Samples were registered in the department of SPU State Enterprise "Pharmacopeia center". In accordance with the Ph. Eur. and SPU requirements in "identification C" determination was performed by TLC. TLC was performed on glass-backed silica gel F 254 Merck plates, size 20 x 10 cm. Test solutions from samples of dried raw material were prepared by extraction of 1 % solution of hydrochloric acid in 95 % ethanol with ultrasound for 60 minutes at 50 º C. As mobile phase solvent mixture ethyl acetate - anhydrous acetic acid - formic acid - water ratio (100 : 10 : 10 : 25) was selected. For preparation the reference solution 1 mg chrysanthemin was dissolved in 10 mL of 1 % solution of hydrochloric acid in 95 % ethanol. Fresh bird cherry fruits test solutions of the samples were crushed to mash (free of seeds), 10 mL of methanol was added and treated with ultrasound for 15 minutes. As mobile phase solvent mixture formic acid anhydrous-waterbutanol ratio (16 : 19 : 65) was selected. Two reference solutions were used. First was prepared from 2 mg chrysanthemum dissolved in 5 mL of methanol and second was Pharmacopoeial Reference Standard SPU of bird cherry extract dissolved in 0. 2 mL of methanol with ultrasound bath. Test solutions and the reference solutions were placed onto the chromatographic plates and placed into the chamber. When the chromatograms developed, the plates were taken out, then observed the spots in daylight. Results and discussion. In the chromatogram it was observed for all dry bird cherry fruits samples two pink-red color zones, one of which coincided for Rf and color of chrysanthemin, and the other one was slightly lower. The chromatogram for all samples of fresh raw material showed two pinkish-violet zones, one of which had Rf and color corresponded chrysanthemin, and the second one was slightly lower. Compared with bird cherry extract, it was observed two pinkish-violet zones, coincided with Rf and color of bird cherry (SPU) extract zones. In accordance with the requirements of Ph. Eur. identification by TLC is obligatory. Division of anthocyanins of plant raw materials was observed sufficiently in our chosen solvent systems and methods of analysis that allows to recommend these systems and methods of analysis for inclusion in the relevant sections of monographs for bird cherry fruit, dried and fresh for SPU. Conclusion. It was confirmed the opportunity to include in the <b>national</b> <b>monographs</b> "Bird cherry fruits fresh " and " Bird cherry fruits dry" in section "Identification C" analysis of anthocyanin by TLC in chosen systems and methods...|$|E
40|$|The recent report, Changing {{publishing}} ecologies: A landscape {{study of}} new university presses and academic-led publishing, shows a discernible increase in new UK publishing initiatives entering the sector {{over the last}} few years. The new university press strand of the research consisted of a survey, which collected 43 responses, the academic-led press strand was informed by interviews with 14 scholar-led presses. Taking different approaches for these two types of press, the report captures the take-up, reasoning and characteristics of these initiatives, as well as their future plans. It complements previous research, such as OAPEN-UK, the UK <b>National</b> <b>Monographs</b> strategy, the Jisc/OAPEN Investigating OA monograph services project and the new Knowledge Exchange Landscape Study on Open Access Monographs which will be published in September 2017. These new publishing initiatives have a potentially disruptive effect on the scholarly communication environment, providing new avenues for the dissemination of research outputs and acting as pathfinders for the evolution of academic publishing and the scholarly record. The findings of the research carried out as part of this report provide an evidence base for future support for both new university presses and academic-led publishing initiatives to help create and maintain a diverse publishing ecology. The report concludes with a series of recommendations to help support and foster new developments in this space, share best practice, collaboration and the tools and services to facilitate further innovation. For example, the report recommends to support community building for both NUPs and ALPs, the establishment of guidelines for setting up a press, the provision of legal advice and guidelines for preservation and dissemination, and the development of future projects to support these new initiatives. In particular, the community professed a need {{for the development of a}} toolkit that would aid both existing NUPs and academic-led presses, as well as those universities and academics that are thinking about setting up their own publishing initiatives. This paper will precis the report, before exploring the progress made in establishing an infrastructure for UK university and academic-led presses. Finally, the author would like to encourage other European countries to build upon this research by adapting the questions asked in the research. This would allow for a more complete view of European NUPs and ALPs and the demand for shared approach, such as a wider set of best practice guidelines, workshops and a European Library Publishing Coalition for library presses...|$|E

40|$|This volume {{grows out}} of the {{research}} on the United States summarized in Low-Wage America: How Employers Are Reshaping Opportunity in the Workplace (Appelbaum, Bernhardt, and Murnane 2003), which sought to understand how U. S. firms were responding to economic globalization, deregulation, and technological progress and the impact of these responses on typical low-wage frontline workers. Two broad conclusions emerged from the array of qualitative and quantitative data presented in Low-Wage America. First, while most U. S. firms responded to the economic pressures of the last three decades by engaging in cost-cutting efforts that resulted in deteriorating pay and working conditions for their frontline workers, some firms chose different competitive strategies that yielded better outcomes for workers. These alternative "high- road" labor market strategies included focusing on reorganizing the work process, increasing capital intensity, introducing new technology, implementing innovations in products and services, and providing more and better training. These measures generally sought to raise the productivity or lower the turnover of low-wage workers in ways that would offset the higher initial investments or ongoing costs of taking the "high road. " 1 The second broad conclusion of Low-Wage America was that labor market institutions have an important impact on firms' choices about how to respond to competitive pressures. From the end of the 1970 s to the present, the decline in unionization rates and the erosion of the real value of the minimum wage, for example, have made it substantially easier for U. S. firms to respond to market challenges by taking the "low road. " But still, some firms did choose high-road workplace practices in organizing and rewarding the work of less-skilled em ployees. And these decisions appear to have been shaped by labor market institutions-an employers' association in North Carolina that facilitated training and modernization, fostered new product development, sought new markets, and improved outcomes for both workers and companies; a training facility, jointly managed by hospitals and the health care union in New York City, that improved skills and pay for less-skilled hospital workers; high union density in a vacation destination city with upmarket hotels that led to substantially higher wages and better working conditions for hotel housekeepers. Nevertheless, only a small minority of the firms studied followed such high-road practices. In research focused solely on the United States, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the role of institutions in determining outcomes for workers in low-paid jobs. There is little institutional variation across the United States-the examples just given of strong labor market institutions in particular locales are widely recognized as exceptions to the general pattern of weak employers' associations, a low level of union density, and the failure of employers to train frontline workers. Our idea was that there might be much to be learned about the nature of jobs that are low-wage in the United States by studying these same jobs in other advanced industrial nations with very different institutional settings. More precisely, our key assumption was that the effects on national economies of changing technology, increasing globalization, and intensifying competition are filtered through institutional structures and, further, that these effects can be observed in the strategic decisions made by firms and in the quality of jobs held by workers. Indeed, this thinking was the genesis of the Russell Sage Foundation's decision to undertake industry-based case studies of job quality in foreign economies in 2005 - 2006. Selecting the comparison countries required balancing a set of factors. To be most useful, the comparison economies had to be different from the United States (and from each other), but not so radically different with respect to economic, political, and institutional (including cultural) institutions that they would bring little to a U. S. -focused discussion. Ultimately, three large economies-France, Germany, and the United Kingdom- And two smaller northern European economies-Denmark and the Netherlands-were selected. Researchers in all five countries followed a common methodology built around firm-level case studies in five industries-call centers, food processing, hospitals, hotels, and retail trade. 2 Within each firm and industry, country teams focused on specific tasks typically performed in the United States by low-wage frontline workers: call center operators; operators in food processing; nursing assistants and cleaners in hospitals; hotel housekeepers; and cashiers and stock or sales clerks in retail. To complement these case studies, national researchers also used available data to draw the broader contours of low-wage and less-skilled work in each country. 3 To measure the extent of low-wage work, national teams defined low-wage workers as those workers earning a gross hourly wage of less than two-thirds of each country's median gross hourly wage. The relative definition of low-wage work has several advantages over an absolute definition. The relative definition abstracts from differences in wages that simply reflect differences in average incomes across the six countries. 4 More importantly, the relative definition reflects the view that relative pay matters both economically and socially. Firms are continuously making hiring and investment decisions based on the relative costs of different kinds of workers and different technologies. And workers are intrinsically concerned about the implied social valuation of their work that is included in the relative wage. This social aspect of pay suggests that relative pay is also a key dimension of job quality. Indeed, beyond pay, job quality {{is at the center of}} the analytical focus of this research. European countries have seen a renewed interest in this issue since the 1990 s, and job quality has acquired an important place in the social and employment agenda of the European Union (see Gallie 2007). In this volume, we use the concept of job quality in its broadest sense, covering all the terms of employment and working conditions that may have an impact on the well-being of workers, both at work and in their private lives. Measuring job quality inevitably involves striking a balance between objective job characteristics and workers' subjective perceptions, including those related to job satisfaction. Most analyses of the key determinants of job quality focus on: compensation, including benefits or social entitlements (such as health insurance, pension, paid vacation, parental leave, paid sick days, and other nonwage compensation); contractual status, in particular whether the job is permanent or temporary (one of the fundamental determinants of job security); training and career opportunities; task discretion and other aspects of job design, such as work pace; health and safety conditions; and work schedules, including the scope for finding a balance between work and family life. The project's firm-level case studies, which focused on specific occupations in the same industries in all six countries, were particularly well suited to comparing these many dimensions of job quality across a variety of national institutional structures. As far as possible, national teams attempted to study eight firms in each industry in each country. 5 In each firm, employers, executives, employees' representatives, and a sample of workers were interviewed following shared guidelines. The case studies also included workplace visits and, where possible, quantitative data provided by the firms. The results of each national research effort were first published in five <b>national</b> <b>monographs.</b> 6 This volume seeks to extract some of the comparative lessons, reintroducing the American case. The main sources of the evidence and analysis here are the <b>national</b> <b>monographs</b> for the five European countries; this volume also draws less directly on earlier research presented in Low-Wage America, which has been updated and supplemented by U. S. -based researchers working with the European teams. The remainder of this chapter summarizes the main findings of the project. Copyright © 2010 by Russell Sage Foundation...|$|E

40|$|Can one {{produce an}} {{international}} comparison of cultural policies, and if so, how? These are our initial questions. The {{possibility of a}} comparative approach appears as a particular problem in France, where the thesis positing {{the very existence of}} cultural policies – amalgamated with the existence of a ministry for culture – as nationally specific enjoys a broad consensus, thereby depriving any comparative analysis of an object. Whether it is celebrated or denounced, i the „French exception ‟ is scarcely questioned. Furthermore, the „French model ‟ has become the object of an export drive, as is shown by the occupation by agents from the Ministry of Culture of positions in international institutions (Unesco, the Council of Europe), the recent organisation of the „Malraux colloquia ‟ whose vocation is the diffusion of this „unique model ‟ across the world, and even the references in other countries to this supposed „model‟. ii Against this flat refusal of any comparative approach, seeing no foreign cases for comparison, one can set – notably in the framework of specialised international organisations – the juxtaposition of <b>national</b> <b>monograph</b> studies that presuppose a common identity for objects presented as equivalent.

40|$|The {{county of}} Kent is {{exceptionally}} rich in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries. Systematic excavations {{of some of}} these cemeteries in the 18 th and early 19 th centuries provided a wealth of finds that reflect Kent's close political and economic ties to the Frankish world in the 5 th to 7 th centuries. Excavations by the Revd Bryan Faussett in 1757 - 73 uncovered c. 750 graves from sites at Crundale, Guilton, Kingston Down, Bishopsbourne, Barfrestone and Sibertswold Downs, Bekesbourne and Chartham Down. Further excavations, in particular those carried out at Bifrons and Sarre in the 19 th century, raised the number of excavated graves to well over 1000. The bulk of information was made available to subscribers in the Inventorium Sepulchrale (Faussett 1856) and in the journal Archaeologia Cantiana. In 1961, the need to re-publish this important material to a modern standard led Sonia Hawkes of the University of Oxford's Institute of Archaeology to undertake the publication of Kentish cemeteries as the first stage of a <b>national</b> <b>monograph</b> series, the Corpus of Anglo-Saxon Graves and Grave-Goods. Work carried out between 1961 and 1971 dealt with the c. 1140 graves and large numbers of unassociated objects from Bifrons, Sarre and the seven sites excavated by Faussett, resulting in an extensive archive comprising object descriptions, drawings, photographs and X-rays.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{tradition}} of European phytosociology, delimitations of vegetation units such as associations are mostly {{based on data from}} small areas where more detailed vegetation sampling has been carried out. Such locally delimited vege-tation units are often accepted in large-scale synthetic classifications, e. g. <b>national</b> vegetation <b>monographs,</b> and tentatively assigned to a small geographical range, forming groups of similar (vicarious) vegetation units in different small areas. These vicarious units, however, often overlap in species composition and are difficult to recognize from each other. We demonstrate this issue using an example of the classification of dry grasslands (Festuco-Brometea) in the Czech Republic. The standard vegetation classification of the Czech Republic supposes that the majority of accepted associations (66 out of 68) have a restricted distribution in one of the two major regions, Bohemia or Moravia. We compared the classification into traditional associations with the numerical classification of 1440 phytosociological relevés from the Czech Republic, in order to test whether {{the tradition}}ally recognized associations with small geographical ranges are reflected in numerical classification. In various comparisons, the groups of relevés identified by numerical analysis occupied larger areas than the traditional associations. This suggests that with consistent use of total species composition as the vegetation classification criterion, the resulting classification will usually include more vegetation units with larger geographical ranges, while many of the traditional local associations will disappear.

This work {{is based on a}} series of macrofungi surveys, carried out by the authors, between 2005 and 2011, in six representative sites. Taxonomy and nomenclature follows Kirk et al. (2001) and Kirk (2004 - 2011). Current species distribution was consulted in: online international and <b>national</b> diversity databases, <b>monographs</b> and other <b>national</b> and international publications. As a result 318 taxa were recorded, 68. 9 % in cork-oak and 71. 7 % in holm-oak woodlands, with 40. 6 % of shared taxa. Concerning trophic strategy, 142 mycorrhizal, 173 saprotrophic and 3 parasites were found. The mycorrhizal/saprotrophic quotient was higher in cork-oak (1. 12 ± 0. 16) than in holm-oak (0. 77 ± 0. 14) woodlands. Two orders, Agaricales and Russulales, comprised 81 % of the total identified taxa. There was almost no dissimilarity on the number of taxa per family between cork and holm-oak, except for Amanitaceae and Cortinariaceae, both exhibiting higher values in cork-oak. Of the total taxa, 29 represent new records to Portugal...|$|R
40|$|Patient-centered {{communication}} (PCC) is {{a critical}} element of patient-centered care, which the Institute of Medicine (Committee on Quality of Health Care in America, 2001) promulgates as essential to improving healthcare delivery. Consequently, the US National Cancer Institute's Strategic Plan for Leading the Nation (2006) calls for assessing the delivery of PCC in cancer care. However, no comprehensive measure of PCC exists, and stakeholders continue to embrace different conceptualizations and assumptions about how to measure it. Our approach was grounded in the PCC conceptual framework presented in a recent US <b>National</b> Cancer Institute <b>monograph</b> (Epstein & Street, 2007). In this study, we developed a comprehensive inventory of domains and subdomains for PCC by reviewing relevant literature and theories, interviewing {{a limited number of}} cancer patients, and consulting experts. The resulting measurement domains are organized under the six core functions specified in the PCC conceptual framework: exchanging information, fostering healing relationships, recognizing and responding to emotions, managing uncertainty, making decisions, and enabling patient self-management. These domains represent a promising platform for operationalizing the complicated PCC construct. Although this study focused specifically on cancer care, the PCC measurements are relevant to other clinical contexts and illnesses, given that patient-centered care is a goal across all healthcare. Finally, we discuss considerations for developing PCC measures for research, quality assessment, and surveillance purposes.

40|$|Purpose: There {{is little}} {{evidence}} to document patient satisfaction with follow-up care provided by family physicians (FPs) /general practitioners (GPs) to breast cancer patients. We aimed to identify determi-nants of satisfaction with such care in low-income, medically underserved women with breast cancer. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 145 women who reported receiving follow-up care from an FP/GP. Women were enrolled in California’s Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program and were interviewed by phone 3 years after their breast cancer diagnosis. Cleary and McNeil’s model, which states that patient satisfaction {{is a function of}} patient characteristics, structure of care, and processes of care, was used to understand the determinants of satisfaction. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify significant predictors. Results: Of the patients interviewed, 73. 4 % reported that they were extremely satisfied with their treatment by the FP/GP. Women who were able to ask their family physicians questions about their breast cancer had six times greater odds of being extremely satisfied compared with women who were not able to ask any questions. Women who scored the FP higher on the ability to explain things in a way she could understand had higher odds of being extremely satisfied compared with women who scored their family physicians lower. Conclusions: FPs/GPs providing follow-up care for breast cancer patients should encourage patients to ask questions and must communicate in a way that patients understand. These recommendations are congruent with the characteristics of patient-centered communication for cancer patients enunciated in a recent <b>National</b> Cancer Institute <b>monograph.</b> (J Am Board Fam Med 2011; 24 : 710 – 716. ...|$|R
