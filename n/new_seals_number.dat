5000|$|... b {{fields are}} signed but NOT {{included}} in the DigSig envelope - only the signed field value is stored on the AIDC. Therefor {{the value of a}} b field must be collected by the verifier before verification can be performed. This is useful to link a physical object with an barcode and/or RFID tag to be used as an anti-counterfeiting measure; for example the <b>seal</b> <b>number</b> of a bottle of wine may be a b field. The verifier needs to enter the <b>seal</b> <b>number</b> for a successful verification since it is not stored in the barcode on the bottle. When the seal is broken the <b>seal</b> <b>number</b> may also be destroyed and yielded unreadable; the verification can therefore not take place since it requires the <b>seal</b> <b>number.</b> A replacement <b>seal</b> must display the same seal number; using holograms and other techniques may make the generation of a <b>new</b> copied <b>seal</b> <b>number</b> not viable. Similarly the unique tag ID, also known is the TID in ISO/IEC 18000, can be used in this manner to prove that the data is stored on the correct tag. In this case the TID is a b field. The interrogator will read the DigSig envelope from the changeable tag memory and then read the non-changeable unique TID to allow for the verification. If the data was copied from one tag to another, then the verification process of the signed TID, as stored in the DigSig envelope, will reject the TID of the copied tag.|$|R

40|$|Australian {{fur seals}} (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) breed on Bass Strait islands in Victoria and Tasmania. They have been {{recorded}} in South Australia (SA) for many years as non-breeding visitors and on Kangaroo Island frequently since 1988, mostly in breeding colonies of the <b>New</b> Zealand fur <b>seal</b> (A. forsteri) {{which is the most}} numerous pinniped in SA. Australian fur <b>seals</b> have displaced <b>New</b> Zealand fur <b>seals</b> from sections of the Cape Gantheaume colony on Kangaroo Island. North Casuarina Island produced 29 Australian fur seal pups in February 2008. Australian fur seal pups were larger than <b>New</b> Zealand fur <b>seal</b> pups in the same colony and have been identified genetically using a 263 -bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region. North Casuarina Island has been an important breeding colony of <b>New</b> Zealand fur <b>seals,</b> but pup <b>numbers</b> there decreased since 1992 – 93 (contrary to trends in SA for <b>New</b> Zealand fur <b>seals),</b> while <b>numbers</b> of Australian fur seals there have increased. This study confirms that Australian fur seals breed in SA. The two fur seal species compete for space onshore at several sites. Australian fur seals may compete for food with endangered Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea) because both are bottom feeders. Peter D. Shaughnessy, Jane McKenzie, Melanie L. Lancaster, Simon D.

40|$|Observing how {{pinnipeds}} {{respond to}} variations in climatic and oceanographic conditions informs marine managers on {{factors that could}} limit their range, foraging ability and breeding success. Here, we examine how Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) at Seal Rocks, Victoria, Australia, responded to normal climatic conditions from August 2009 to January 2010, which included their Austral spring-summer breeding period, to investigate their tolerances {{to a range of}} environmental stimuli. <b>Seal</b> <b>numbers</b> ashore and a range of climatic variables were collected hourly during daylight periods and compared using Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs). Air temperature was the most consistent predictor of haul-out behavior, with <b>seal</b> <b>numbers</b> ashore declining as air temperature increased (effect size - 50 %, edf 1. 00, P < 0. 001). Increased wave height (effect size 74 %, edf 1. 00, P < 0. 001) and wind speed (effect size 79 %, edf 1. 00, P < 0. 001) were associated with increased <b>seal</b> <b>numbers</b> ashore. Potentially, higher air temperatures reduce the seals tolerance to remain out of the water, while high wind/wave action increases at-sea metabolic costs. These results demonstrate how changes in climate could alter a seal's ability to remain ashore, to rest or breed, and its ability to forage effectively, thus driving changes in population status and range...|$|R
