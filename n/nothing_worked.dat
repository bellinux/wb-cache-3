25|$|Bossy {{hoped to}} go to {{training}} camp {{in the fall of}} 1987, but no medical therapy had changed his condition. He then took the 1987-88 season off to try different treatments for his back. <b>Nothing</b> <b>worked,</b> and no one could figure out what exactly was wrong. Though only thirty-one years old, Bossy was forced to officially retire in October 1988. After his playing days were over, he was unable to play hockey or even work out because of his back and knees.|$|E
25|$|She {{eventually}} deteriorated into {{a permanent}} state of detachment from reality. Thackeray desperately sought cures for her, but <b>nothing</b> <b>worked,</b> and {{she ended up}} in two different asylums in or near Paris until 1845, after which Thackeray took her back to England, where he installed her with a Mrs Bakewell at Camberwell. Isabella outlived her husband by 30 years, in the end being cared for by a family named Thompson in Leigh-on-Sea at Southend until her death in 1894. After his wife's illness Thackeray became a de facto widower, never establishing another permanent relationship. He did pursue other women, however, in particular Mrs Jane Brookfield and Sally Baxter. In 1851 Mr Brookfield barred Thackeray from further visits to or correspondence with Jane. Baxter, an American twenty years Thackeray's junior whom he met during a lecture tour in New York City in 1852, married another man in 1855.|$|E

500|$|The {{fourth and}} fifth {{aircraft}} of the parade batch were used in flight tests to eliminate the engine flameout problem from late 1947 through early 1948. They were fitted with a prominent rectangular hollow vane on {{the barrel of the}} N-37 cannon that was nicknamed the [...] "butterfly" [...] (bahbochka). This allowed all three cannon to be fired simultaneously at altitudes up to , but the fin disintegrated after only 813 shots, which could be very dangerous if the debris from the fin was ingested by the engines. An additional problem was that the fin hampered the directional stability of the aircraft and caused it to yaw after 3–5 shots. Another attempt to fix the problem was made in the I-302 (izdeliye FP), a modification of a production aircraft, that moved the N-37 to the port side of the aircraft, but this was apparently not successful either. Other attempts to ameliorate the problem included fitting a muzzle brake on the N-37 as well as extending its barrel, but <b>nothing</b> <b>worked.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In Chinese culture Empress Dowager Cixi’s {{eating habits}} {{are still a}} topic of discussion. During the height of her reign, {{it was said that}} the chefs in her private kitchen could make more than 400 types of dim sum and more than 4,000 other dishes that {{included}} fish, duck, chicken, meat and shark fin. Every morning she would drink a bowl of [...] "snow fungus" [...] (Tremella fuciformis) soup specially made by a eunuch named Zhang Fu. It is said she started eating this soup because she had caught a persistent case of diarrhea that <b>nothing</b> <b>worked</b> to cure until an imperial doctor presented her with a bowl of tremella soup. According to traditional Chinese medicine, among other health benefits, snow fungus helps to boost the immune system. Cixi also was well known for her seasonal eating habits. At certain times of the year she would eat certain foods because she believed that this would balance her health and give her the nutrients she would need as her body changed with the seasons.|$|E

60|$|The {{horror of}} it drove {{me out on}} deck. I was feeling sick and squeamish, {{and sat down on}} a bench. In a hazy way I saw and heard men rushing and {{shouting}} as they strove to lower the boats. It was just as I had read descriptions of such scenes in books. The tackles jammed. <b>Nothing</b> <b>worked.</b> One boat lowered away with the plugs out, filled with women and children and then with water, and capsized. Another boat had been lowered by one end, and still hung in the tackle by the other end, where it had been abandoned. Nothing was to be seen of the strange steamboat which had caused the disaster, though I heard men saying that she would undoubtedly send boats to our assistance.|$|E

The fish came out of the shares of Dog-Tooth, Big-Fat, and Sea-Lion, which they three did not eat. So all the money belonged to them. Then they told Three-Legs and the other land-owners that they would take their share of corn and roots in money, Little-Belly that they would take their share of fish in money, Pig-Jaw that they would take their share of goats and cheese in money. Thus, a man who had <b>nothing,</b> <b>worked</b> for one who had, and was paid in money. With this money he bought corn, and fish, and meat, and cheese. And Three- Legs and all owners of things paid Dog-Tooth and Sea-Lion and Big- Fat their share in money. And they paid the guards and watchers in money, and the guards and watchers bought their food with the money. And, because money was cheap, Dog-Tooth made many more men into guards. And, because money was cheap to make, a number of men began to make money out of shell themselves. But the guards stuck spears in them and shot them full of arrows, because they were trying to break up the tribe. It was bad to break up the tribe, for then the Meat-Eaters would come over the divide and kill them all.|$|E
