He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E

The fetus has at most one, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain—the timing of which is disputed), and hence is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person.</b>|$|E

25|$|Catholics {{say that}} Santa Muerte is an idol, {{the worship of}} which has been {{rejected}} by God in the Old Testament. Veneration of this or any other idol can be a form of inadvertent devil-worship, because regardless of the intent of the worshipers; the devil can trick people into doing such things. Priests regularly chastise parishioners, telling them that death is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> but rather a phase of life. However, the Church stops short of labeling such followers as heretics, instead accusing them of heterodoxy.|$|E

25|$|While he {{understood}} the jurisdictional issue was most important to them and planned to discuss it first, Gottesman told the justices, he hoped {{to spend some time}} on the facts of the case. He conceded that the implied cause of action he saw was not necessary to establish jurisdiction. Rather, it had been a response to the school district's late argument that it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> under Section 1983, and that he should have cross-appealed Hogan's ruling, in which he dismissed the case against the individual members as defendants, but did not because he did not expect that issue to arise again.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} outcomes on {{the conclusion of}} a first date. The two individuals may agree to a second date. One or both parties may decide that there were compatibility issues and decide not to pursue further dates. Compatibility factors vary a great deal, and can include religion, whether or <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> uses drugs or alcohol, appearance, or personality. Alternatively, the two parties may decide to become friends or some other type of Platonic relationship (a non-sexual relationship). Some first dates may lead to a romantic relationship that can range in duration from short period to a long period.|$|E
25|$|The next psychic {{claimed to}} be able to read auras around people. He claimed that auras were visible at least five inches above each of them. He {{selected}} ten people who he said had clearly visible auras. They were to stand behind screens and he claimed that their auras would be visible above the screens, which were numbered 1 through 10, and the subjects were told by the astrologer behind which screen to stand. He was to tell whether or <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> was standing behind each screen, by seeing their aura above. Since random guessing would be expected to get about five correct, the psychic needed to get eight of the ten right. The psychic stated that he saw an aura over all ten screens, but people were behind only four of the screens.|$|E

25|$|Ambiguity is {{one factor}} that affects whether or <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> assists another in need. In {{situations}} in which the bystander(s) are not sure if a person requires assistance (a high ambiguity situation), reaction time is slow (hearing a person fall but not sure if they are hurt). In low ambiguity situations (a person yelling out for help) reaction times for bystanders is quicker than high ambiguity situations. In some cases of high ambiguity, it can take a person or group up to 5 times as long before taking action than in cases of low ambiguity. The number of bystanders in each condition is not a significant factor. In these cases, bystanders determine their own safety before proceeding. Bystanders {{are more likely to}} intervene in low ambiguity, insignificant consequence situations than in high ambiguity, significant consequence situations.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years before}} their ascent, Grove had {{stood in the}} Hotel Royal in Chamouni (Chamonix), trying to persuade two young ladies and their father, who were using a {{telescope}} to view the peaks around Mont Blanc, that a black dot on the summit snowfield was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> but a distant rock some hundreds of feet in height. By chance they espied a real group of climbers, appearing as extremely small dots making {{their way across the}} Dôme du Goûter. Attempting to devise for them some imaginary route by which they might have reached that point, Grove showed them the fine snow crest descending in a gentle curve from the sharp and still unclimbed summit of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. The thought then struck him that an expedition to the summit, with an exit down the eastern ridge towards the easy Dôme du Goûter might actually make a fine undertaking.|$|E
25|$|According to Catholic teaching, perfect contrition, {{coupled with}} a firm {{resolution}} to sin no more, can restore a person's relationship with God, as well as God's saving grace. Under ordinary circumstances this takes place through absolution, which is received during the Sacrament of Penance. However, as God's mercy and forgiveness is not bound by the Sacrament of Penance, under extraordinary circumstances a mortal sin can be remitted through imperfect contrition, which is a human act that arises from a person's love of God. When perfect contrition is {{the means by which}} one seeks to restore one's relationship with God, there must also be a resolution to confess all mortal sins (that have not been confessed and absolved previously) in the Sacrament of Penance. A resolution to confess these sins should be made with an act of perfect contrition, regardless of whether or <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> believes that they will have access to the Sacrament of Penance.|$|E

25|$|New Haven is {{the birthplace}} of former {{president}} George W. Bush, who was born when his father, former president George H. W. Bush, was living in New Haven while a student at Yale. In addition to being {{the site of the}} college educations of both Presidents Bush, as Yale students, New Haven was also the temporary home of former presidents William Howard Taft, Gerald Ford, and Bill Clinton, as well as Secretary of State John Kerry. President Clinton met his wife, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while the two were students at Yale Law School. Former vice presidents John C. Calhoun and Dick Cheney also studied in New Haven (although the latter did not graduate from Yale). Before the 2008 election, the last time there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> with ties to New Haven and Yale on either major party's ticket was 1968. James Hillhouse, a New Haven native, served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate in 1801.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the Austrian {{parliament}} banned {{experiments on}} apes, {{unless they are}} performed {{in the interests of}} the individual ape. Also in Austria, the Supreme Court ruled in January 2008 that a chimpanzee (called Matthew Hiasl Pan by those advocating for his personhood) was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> after the Association Against Animal Factories sought personhood status for him because his custodians had gone bankrupt. The chimpanzee had been captured as a baby in Sierra Leone in 1982, then smuggled to Austria to be used in pharmaceutical experiments, but was discovered by customs officials when he arrived in the country, and was taken to a shelter instead. He was kept there for 25 years, until the group that ran the shelter went bankrupt in 2007. Donors offered to help him, but under Austrian law only a person can receive personal gifts, so any money sent to support him would be lost to the shelter's bankruptcy. The Association appealed the ruling to the European Court of Human Rights. The lawyer proposing the chimpanzee's personhood asked the court to appoint a legal guardian for him and to grant him four rights: the right to life, limited freedom of movement, personal safety, and the right to claim property.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Aphrodite" [...] is a nineties-influenced dance-pop song which {{features}} a [...] "foot-stomping" [...] beat and [...] "military drummed" [...] instrumentation, {{similar to that of}} a marching band. Stuart Price likened the song to Janet Jackson for its [...] "‘Rhythm Nation’-esque qualities." [...] The song is penned like a dance anthem through which Minogue [...] "brags" [...] about her sexual prowess; she warns that she is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> meant to be confronted and angered, as heard in the lines [...] "I'm fierce and I'm feeling mighty/Don't you mess with me, you don't wanna fight me".|$|E

Bannon has said that he uses his lyrics and Converge to [...] "vent about things in a healthy way so I'm <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> that walks around with a lot of negative energy."

500|$|Manson has {{referred}} to Born Villain as the band's [...] "grandest concept record". He has said its title {{was inspired by the}} controversy which surrounded the band after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, when elements of the mainstream media falsely accused the band of influencing its perpetrators. The title also references the nature versus nurture argument, with Manson elaborating to CNN: [...] "In any story, the villain is the catalyst. The hero's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who will bend the rules or show the cracks in his armor. He's one-dimensional intentionally, but the villain is the person who owns up to what he is and stands by it. He'll do things that are sometimes morally questionable, but he does it because it's his nature to do it, and it never fluctuates." ...|$|E

Charles insisted that the trial was illegal, explaining that, [...] The court, by contrast, challenged the doctrine of sovereign immunity, and proposed that [...] "the King of England was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> but an office whose every occupant was entrusted with a limited power to govern 'by and according to the laws of the land and not otherwise'." ...|$|E
