50|$|Diagnosis of <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis</b> largely clinical. Biopsies are {{typically}} not necessary, and {{cannot be used}} to rule out other atopic dermatitis or other eczemas. However, patch testing may be employed to rule out irritants (contact dermatitis) as a cause. In children, <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is commonly confused with tinea corporis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nummular</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is {{characterized}} by chronic or relapsing itchy coin-sized ovoid-shaped red plaques. They can occur on the trunk, limbs, face, and hands.|$|E
50|$|Nutritional {{deficiency}} eczema is {{a pattern}} of eczema with localized, thickened, scaling patches that have some characteristics of <b>nummular</b> eczema, seborrheic <b>dermatitis,</b> and neurodermatitis that {{may be seen in}} alcoholics.|$|R
50|$|A skin biopsy can be {{performed}} to test for EAC; tests should {{be performed}} to rule out other possible diseases such as: pityriasis rosea, tinea corporis, psoriasis, <b>nummular</b> eczema, atopic <b>dermatitis,</b> drug reaction, erythema migrans and other rashes.|$|R
50|$|Weaker topical steroids are {{utilized}} for thin-skinned and sensitive areas, especially areas under occlusion, {{such as the}} armpit, groin, buttock crease, breast folds. Weaker steroids are used on the face, eyelids, diaper area, perianal skin, and intertrigo of the groin or body folds. Moderate steroids are used for atopic <b>dermatitis,</b> <b>nummular</b> eczema, xerotic eczema, lichen sclerosis et atrophicus of the vulva, scabies (after scabiecide) and severe dermatitis. Strong steroids are used for psoriasis, lichen planus, discoid lupus, chapped feet, lichen simplex chronicus, severe poison ivy exposure, alopecia areata, nummular eczema, and severe atopic dermatitis in adults.|$|R
50|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in the United States is approximately 2 per 1,000. It {{is considered a}} disease of adulthood, for it is rare in children.|$|E
50|$|Many contact sensitizers or {{irritants}} {{are known}} to cause contact dermatitis superimposed on <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Studies have implicated nickel, cobalt, chromate, and fragrance as likely culprits. Xerosis, or dehydration of skin is also a likely cause. Infection with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria or Candida may also play a role.|$|E

40|$|Epicutaneous (patch) test is a {{standard}} test to confirm contact allergy. During a six-year period (1998 - 2003), contact allergic dermati tis was di ag nosed in 4132 (65 %) of 6341 pa tients us ing stan dard patch test with a Croatian series of al lergens according to the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group (ICDRG). The most common clinical diagnoses related to contact allergy (male; female) were contact allergic dermatitis (65. 4 %; 72. 2 %); atopic dermatitis (15. 9 %; 11. 7 %); contact irritant dermatitis (7. 0 %; 6. 6 %) and <b>nummular</b> eczematoid <b>dermatitis</b> (4. 2 %; 2. 4 %). Ac cording to occupation, positive patch test reaction was most com monly observed in work ers, whereas 65 % of patients showed positive reactions {{to one or more}} substances. There was an in creased frequency of positive patch test reactions to potassium dichromate, nickel sulfate, thimerosal and neomycine sulfate, along with a significant decrease in the frequency of positive patch test reactions to cobalt chloride, carbamix, wood tars, de tergents, parabens mixture, urushiol and rubber mixture.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} under carefully controlled clinical conditions the relative anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic action of betamethasone as compared with prednisone and a placebo. A total of 130 consecutive patients with atopic dermatitis, primary irritant <b>dermatitis,</b> <b>nummular</b> eczema, allergic eczematous contact dermatitis, sweat retention, seborrheic dermatitis and pruritus were selected for study. Under the conditions of this clinical trial, the samples indicated a difference in anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic response to the therapeutic agents used. The difference between betamethasone and the placebo was highly significant, and the difference in these measured responses was studied on the basis of a careful evaluation and statistically. The result of this study corroborates statistically our clinical impression regarding the therapeutic effect of betamethasone...|$|R
40|$|Background: A chronic {{dermatosis}} like <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis</b> may {{be complicated}} by contact dermatitis {{due to an}} impaired cutaneous barrier. This study is aimed at evaluating secondary contact dermatitis in patients with <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Methods: Patch testing with the Indian Standard Series was performed in 50 of 78 patients with a clinical diagnosis of nummular eczema. Significant reactions were graded as per ICDRG criteria. Results: Significant reactions were noted in 23 of 50 tested patients. The most frequent sensitizers were colophony, nitrofurazone, neomycin sulfate and nickel sulfate (7. 14 &#x 0025; each) Reactions to antigens in topical medications, cosmetics and toiletries constituted 64. 28 &#x 0025; of all the reactions. Conclusions: Patients with <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis</b> are at significant risk of developing secondary allergic contact dermatitis, which contributes to the severity and chronicity of their dermatitis. Patch testing {{has the potential to}} improve the quality of life in these patients. Hence, patients with chronic recalcitrant <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis</b> must be patch tested...|$|E
40|$|The term "dermatitis" (synonym: eczema) {{refers to}} a non-infectious, {{inflammatory}} disorder of the skin. There are different forms of dermatitis including seborrhoeic dermatitis (infantile and adult types), primary irritant dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, dermatitis associated with venous hypertension, dyshidrotic dermatitis (synonym: idiopathic vesicular dermatitis of the hands and feet), photoallergic dermatitis, HIV-associated dermatitis, <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and atopic dermatitis (AD). Atopic dermatitis is common {{and is the only}} form of dermatitis that may affect virtually the entire lifespan of an individual. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) {{is essentially}} diagnosed clinically. In babies and young children, {{the diagnosis is}} usually straightforward. Dry, very pruritic dermatitis starts on the cheeks, with the neck and trunk often involved, but the nappy area spared. Limb involvement follows later – first extensoral, later classically flexural. This is mostly the picture of AD. In adults, the presentation may vary widely. Classic flexural dermatitis may persist, but erythroderma (whole-body involvement), head and neck dermatitis, isolated hand dermatitis and <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis</b> may {{be more difficult to}} identify as AD.

40|$|Dendritic cells bearing Langerhans cell (OKT 6 +) or interdigitating cell (RFD 1 +) immunophenotype may be {{regularly}} detected {{within the}} dermis of chronic skin diseases {{characterized by a}} lymphohistiocytic (lymphoreticular) infiltrate. These 2 subsets of antigen-presenting cells within the dermis of lesions of exacerbating chronic plaque psoriasis, exacerbating <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (discoid eczema), atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, lichen ruber planus, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus were quantified using computer-assisted morphometry. The mean dendrite length per dermal dendritic cell was significantly higher for RFD 1 than for OKT 6 (74. 4 +/- 0. 98 microns vs 70. 0 +/- 1. 26 microns: p = 0. 0023). The mean dendrite length per dermal dendritic cell was remarkably constant for each marker in the various diagnostic categories studied. Disease-specific patterns of total dendrite length and number (expressed per 100 infiltrating mononuclear cells) of these 2 dendritic cell types within the subepidermal infiltrates were obtained. Pityriasis rosea was characterized by its unique high percentage of OKT 6 + Langerhans cells. Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis had relatively high percentages of both RFD 1 + interdigitating cells and OKT 6 + Langerhans cells. <b>Nummular</b> <b>dermatitis</b> had an intermediate number and total dendrite length for OKT 6, but was relatively low in RFD 1 + cells. Allergic contact dermatitis, lichen planus, and lupus erythematosus had low numbers and dendrite lengths for both dendritic cell subsets. It is suggested that pityriasis rosea is characterized by an abnormal migration pattern of Langerhans cells. Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis may be examples of diseases in which skin-localized antigen-presenting and T-cell-inducing events are continuously taking place. The other diseases may reflect inflammatory processes in which local antigen presentation is less relevant to the tissue reactio...|$|E
40|$|Carcinoembryonic antigen-related {{cellular}} {{adhesion molecule}} 1 (CEACAM 1) is a cell-surface glycoprotein, {{belonging to the}} carcinoembryonic antigen family, expressed by human neutrophils, epithelial cells, activated T and NK cells. CEACAM 1 is expressed as a cell-surface molecule with different isoforms or can be secreted as a soluble protein. Here, we show that keratinocytes in the outer epidermal layer of psoriatic skin express CEACAM 1, unlike those in healthy skin or in cutaneous lesions of patients with atopic or <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Stimulation of primary human keratinocytes or in vitro reconstituted epidermis with culture supernatants of activated psoriatic lesion-infiltrating T cells, IFN-γ or oncostatin M, but not IL- 17, induced the expression of transcripts for the CEACAM 1 -long and -short isoforms and cell-surface CEACAM 1, whereas soluble CEACAM 1 was not produced. The uppermost layers of the epidermis in psoriatic lesions also contain neutrophils, a cell type with inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Coculture of CEACAM 1 -expressing keratinocytes or CHO transfectants with neutrophils delayed spontaneous apoptosis of the latter cells. These results show that cytokine-induced cell-surface expression of CEACAM 1 by keratinocytes {{in the context of}} a psoriatic environment might contribute to the persistence of neutrophils and thus to ongoing inflammation and the decreased propensity for skin infection, typical for patients with psoriasis...|$|E
40|$|Absolute {{numbers of}} CD 3 + T {{lymphocytes}} and their subpopulations were determined and statistically evaluated in the lesional skin of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, <b>nummular</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> pityriasis rosea, and lichen planus. Skin sections {{were divided into}} horizontal layers and the numbers of CD 3 + T cells as well as CD 4 + inducer and CD 8 + suppressor-cytotoxic T-cell subsets were counted. In addition, absolute numbers of the two subpopulations of inducer T cells, i. e., "memory" (4 B 4 + 2 H 4 -) and "naive" (4 B 4 - 2 H 4 +) were evaluated. Unexpectedly, epidermal infiltration by T cells was highest in psoriasis and lowest in atopic dermatitis. In most cases, this exocytosis was dominated by CD 8 + suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes, with a minimal epidermal mean CD 4 /mean CD 8 ratio of 0. 04 in pityriasis rosea and a maximum of 0. 48 in psoriasis. Inducer T cells within the epidermis were almost exclusively of the 4 B 4 + 2 H 4 - "memory" T-cell subpopulation, whereas 4 B 4 - 2 H 4 + "naive" T cells were extremely uncommon in lesional epidermis. Similar results were obtained for dermal T cells in all diseases studied, i. e., 4 B 4 - 2 H 4 + "naive" T cells were relatively rare. Papillary dermis infiltration by T cells was highest in lichen planus where a mean CD 4 /mean CD 8 ratio of 1. 10, the minimum in this comparative study, was obtained. The mean CD 4 /mean CD 8 ratio of the papillary infiltrate was highest in atopic dermatitis (4. 12). Our results indicate disease-specific and significantly different infiltration patterns of T-lymphocyte subsets in the chronic inflammatory dermatoses investigated.
