5|$|Balaji Sadasivan {{was born}} on 11 July 1955 in Singapore, the son of Indian immigrants. A student at Raffles Institution, Siglap Secondary School (1969–1971) and National Junior College (1972–1973), he {{subsequently}} studied medicine at the University of Singapore. In his second year, he won an essay competition organised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and received the opportunity to attend a healthcare workshop in Minamata, Japan, where he learned about the devastating effects of Minamata disease, a <b>neurological</b> <b>syndrome</b> caused by severe mercury poisoning. This led him to specialise in neurosurgery later on, which was not a popular discipline at the time. In 1979, Sadasivan graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.), {{and two years later}} embarked on further studies at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (F.R.C.S.) in 1984. He trained at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, between 1985 and 1990, obtaining a diploma from the American Board of Neurology Surgery and becoming a fellow at Harvard University in 1990. He also worked at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a teaching affiliate of Harvard, and at the Children's Hospital Boston in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1997, he obtained a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B. (Hons.)) from the University of London.|$|E
25|$|Ontario Minamata {{disease is}} a <b>neurological</b> <b>syndrome</b> caused by severe mercury poisoning. It {{occurred}} in the Canadian province of Ontario, in 1970, and severely affected two First Nation communities in Northwestern Ontario following consumption of local fish contaminated with mercury, and one First Nation in Southern Ontario due to illegal disposal of industrial chemical waste. The disease was named after the infamous case of severe mercury poisoning in the fishing community of Minamata, Japan, which became known as Minamata disease because it devastated only {{the residents of the}} community.|$|E

40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} a multisystem {{infectious}} disease, endemic in parts of Europe, including the West of Ireland. Neurological manifestions (neuroborreliosis) are variable. Presenting <b>neurological</b> <b>syndromes</b> include meningitis, cranial neuropathies, myeloradiculitis and mononeuritis multiplex. A lack of specificity in serological diagnosis may add to diagnostic confusion. We reviewed thirty cases of acute Lyme disease in the West of Ireland and found <b>neurological</b> <b>syndromes</b> in 15 (50 %), with painful radiculopathy (12 patients; 80 %) and cranial neuropathy (7 patients; 46 %) occurring frequently.

2500|$|... is a <b>neurological</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{caused by}} severe mercury poisoning. Identical in {{symptoms}} {{to the original}} outbreak of Minamata disease in Kumamoto Prefecture, the second outbreak in Niigata Prefecture was confirmed with the same name in 1965. The disease was caused by severe mercury poisoning, the source of which was methylmercury released in the wastewater from mercury sulfate-catalysed acetaldehyde production at the Showa Electrical Company's chemical plant in Kanose village. This highly toxic compound was released untreated into the Agano River where it bioaccumulated up the food chain, contaminating fish which when eaten by local people caused symptoms including ataxia, numbness in the hands and feet, general muscle weakness, narrowing {{of the field of}} vision and damage to hearing and speech.|$|E

30|$|Paraneoplastic <b>neurological</b> <b>syndromes</b> {{are defined}} as <b>neurological</b> <b>syndromes</b> caused by an {{autoimmune}} mechanism in cancer patients. Diagnosis of a paraneoplastic syndrome in pre-treatment patients must exclude local neuropathy due to metastasis, opportunistic infections accompanying decreased immune response, vascular disorders with coagulopathy and neuropathy accompanied by malnutrition. It {{should be noted that}} paraneoplastic syndromes are also sometimes found in the treatment phase. Although paraneoplastic syndromes can affect any part of the neuraxis in children, the CNS is the most commonly affected [4].|$|R

The study of <b>neurological</b> <b>syndromes</b> allows us to explore the neural mechanisms that might underlie different aspects of self, such as body image and emotional responses to sensory stimuli, and perhaps even laughter and humour. Mapping the 'functional logic' of the many different attributes of human nature on to specific neural circuits in the brain offers the best hope of understanding how the activity of neurons gives rise to conscious experience.

40|$|Introduction: Pseudo-achalasia (secondary achalasia) : is a {{disorder}} produced by tumor {{at or near}} the gastro-esophageal junction, resulting in manifestation similar to those produced by achalasia. Dysphasia, regurgitation, and weight loss are the main presenting symptoms. Hodgkin's lymphoma is associated with multiple para-neoplastic <b>neurological</b> <b>syndromes,</b> of which demyelinating polyneuropathies are very unusual. Para-neoplastic neuropathies are difficult to diagnose, especially when they are the presenting features. Case presentation: We report a rare case of 11 years old child who presented with pseudo-achalasia and Guillain-Barre syndrome, eventually diagnosed as Hodgkin's lymphoma. Conclusion: Hodgkin's lymphoma can present with pseudo-achalasia and may be associated with para-neoplastic <b>neurological</b> <b>syndrome's...</b>|$|R

40|$|Chromatin {{is vital}} to normal cells, and its {{deregulation}} contributes to a spectrum of human ailments.

Recent evidence has implicated lesions affecting chromatin-remodeling proteins in cancer, developmental disorders and <b>neurological</b> <b>syndromes,</b> suggesting a common source for these different pathologies. Here, we focus on the chromodomain helicase DNA binding chromatin-remodeling family and the recent evidence for its deregulation in diverse pathological conditions, providing a new perspective on the underlying mechanisms and their implications for these prevalent human diseases...|$|R
