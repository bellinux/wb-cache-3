40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} resolving duplicates in a database of places, where a place is defined as any entity that has a <b>name</b> <b>and</b> a physical location. When other auxiliary at-tributes like phone <b>and</b> <b>full</b> <b>address</b> are not available, dedu-plication based solely on <b>names</b> <b>and</b> approximate location becomes an exceptionally challenging problem that requires both domain knowledge as well an local geographical knowl-edge. For example, the pairs “Newpark Mall Gap Outlet” and “Newpark Mall Sears Outlet ” have a high string simi-larity, but determining that they are different requires the domain knowledge that they represent two different store names in the same mall. Similarly, {{in most parts of}} the world, a local business called“Central Park Cafe”might sim-ply be referred to by “Central Park”, except in New York, where the keyword “Cafe ” in the name becomes important to differentiate it from the famous park in the city. In this paper, we present a language model that can encap-sulate both domain knowledge as well as local geographical knowledge. We also present unsupervised techniques that can learn such a model from a database of places. Finally, we present deduplication techniques based on such a model, and we demonstrate, using real datasets, that our techniques are much more effective than simple TF-IDF based models in resolving duplicates. Our techniques are used in produc-tion at Facebook for deduplicating the Places database...|$|R

40|$|Personal data is {{collected}} and stored {{more than ever}} by the governments and companies in the digital age. Even though the data is only released after anonymization, deanonymization is possible by joining different datasets. This puts the privacy of individuals in jeopardy. Furthermore, data leaks can unveil personal identifiers of individuals when security is breached. Processing the leaked dataset can provide even more information than what is visible to naked eye. In this work, we report {{the results of our}} analyses on the recent "Turkish citizen database leak", which revealed the national identifier numbers of close to fifty million voters, along with personal information such as date of birth, birth place, <b>and</b> <b>full</b> <b>address.</b> We show that with automated processing of the data, one can uniquely identify (i) mother's maiden <b>name</b> of individuals <b>and</b> (ii) landline numbers, for a significant portion of people. This is a serious privacy and security threat because (i) identity theft risk is now higher, and (ii) scammers are able to access more information about individuals. The only and utmost goal of this work is to point out to the security risks and suggest stricter measures to related companies and agencies to protect the security and privacy of individuals.
