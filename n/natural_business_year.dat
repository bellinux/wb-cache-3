40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} transforming <b>natural</b> language <b>business</b> specifications into formal models suit-able for use in information systems. In particular, the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) standard {{is used as a}} starting point for both the natural language specifications and the formal representation. In recent years, SBVR-based approaches have been proposed for transforming <b>natural</b> language <b>business</b> rules into models, such as UML Class Diagrams; however, most focus on the transformations performed after the SBVR models have been created and, therefore, simplify or entirely neglect the natural language to SBVR transformation. There are a number of difficulties in transforming natural lan-guage into formal models, such as ambiguity and inconsistency. This paper presents a solution based on a unique combination of techniques from Cognitive Linguistics and Knowledge-based Configuration in order to transform <b>natural</b> language <b>business</b> specifications into SBVR models. We present a comparative survey of state-of-the-art approaches and argue that current solutions do not fulfil the criteria necessary to meet our goals. We demonstrate our approach and show how it improves translation of <b>natural</b> language <b>business</b> specifications into formal models and increases the level of automation for Model-Driven Engineering.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a probabilistic model of labor markets for university graduates, in particular, in Japan. To make {{a model of}} the market efficiently, we take into account several hypotheses. Namely, each company fixes the (<b>business</b> <b>year</b> independent) number of opening positions for newcomers. The ability of gathering newcomers depends on the result of job matching process in past <b>business</b> <b>years.</b> This fact means that the ability of the company is weaken if the company did not make their quota or the company gathered applicants too much over the quota. All university graduates who are looking for their jobs can access the public information about the ranking of companies. Assuming the above essential key points, we construct the local energy function of each company and describe the probability that an arbitrary company gets students at each <b>business</b> <b>year</b> by a Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. We evaluate the relevant physical quantities such as the employment rate. We find that the system undergoes a sort of `phase transition' from the `good employment phase' to `poor employment phase' when one controls the degree of importance for the ranking.
