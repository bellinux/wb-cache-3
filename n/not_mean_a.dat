With these changes, the area under the Council's administration was reduced to 16,806 hectares. On 16 December 1996, Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council was extended to cover the entire area of Kuala Terengganu district back then, including the resort island, Redang Island. With that, the number of the sub-districts increased to 23 while the area increased dramatically to 60,528 hectares. On 1 January 2008, a declaration was made by the state government and Kuala Terengganu became the first city on the East Coast region of Peninsular Malaysia to achieve city status. Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council changed its name to Kuala Terengganu City Council (MBKT) to reflect the change of its status. On 18 September 2014, the northern part of Kuala Terengganu (formerly called as Northern Kuala Terengganu) was declared as the state's newest district with the name of Kuala Nerus. This however does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> creation of a new local government area as Kuala Nerus is still under the jurisdiction of MBKT.|$|E

25|$|In 1907 {{a fourth}} principle, patria, {{was added to}} the other three. Patria did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> {{limitation}} of membership to people of German, Austrian or Swiss origin, as several members from other countries, as Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom show. For example, on 28 February 1905 the first American, Irville Charles LeCompte , later a professor at Yale, was accepted as a member of AV Rappoltstein, then in Strasbourg, now in Cologne (KDStV Rappoltstein).|$|E

25|$|A {{male and}} female macaque form a pair bond and mate, feed, rest, and travel together, and this {{typically}} lasts 16 days on average during the mating season. Females enter into consortships {{with an average of}} four males a season. Higher-ranking males have longer consortships than their subordinates. In addition, higher-ranking males try to disrupt consortships of lower-ranking males. Females attempt to mate with males of any rank. However, dominant males mate more as they are more successful in mate guarding. The female decides whether mating takes place. In addition, dominance does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> male will successfully mate with a female. Males may also temporarily join another troop during the mating season and mate with the females. Females also engage in same-sex mounting. Such behavior is likely because of hormones and females are mounted more often by other females than males.|$|E
25|$|The {{historians are}} also not {{unanimous}} about {{who led the}} missions to Rome and Constantinople. According to Yordan Ivanov the second mission was led by Sondoke, while Venedikov suggests it was Stazis. According to Gyuzelev the leading person in the Bulgarian delegation was Peter which was made clear during the Council of Constantinople. He emphasizes that according {{to the story of}} Anastasius Bibliothecarius the gifts to the Roman legates were sent through Peter. Peter is the person of the Bulgarian delegation in Constantinople who spoke at the Council. Gyuzelev also pays attention to the letters of Pope John VIII. Letters were sent to Boris I (16 April 878 and May 879), to Doks— brother of Boris I (April 878), to Peter (16 April 878) and to high ranking boils including Peter (in the letter of May 879). In the letter of April 878 addressed personally to Peter the Pope called him comita (Petrum comitem). It has been suggested that under comita the Pope did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> regional governor but comes palatii, i. e. the first person in the court of the ruler. Gyuzelev concludes that Peter's role in the events between 866 and 879 is more important than that of the ichirgu-boil Stazis and therefore Peter must have been kavhan at least during that period.|$|E

500|$|According to Charitrapragya, in Jain context syadvada does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> {{doctrine}} of doubt or skepticism, rather it means [...] "multiplicity or multiple possibilities".

500|$|As new {{technologies}} appeared, and with increases in internal productivity, exports increased considerably. This {{made it possible}} to reach equilibrium in the balance of trade. During the 1820s sugar constituted about 30% of total exports while cotton constituted 21%, coffee 18% and leather and skins 14%. Twenty years later coffee would reach 42%, sugar 27%, leather and skins 9%, and cotton 8% of the total exports. This did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> reduction in the production of any of these items and, in fact, the opposite occurred. Growth occurred in all sectors, some more than others. In the period between 1820 and 1840, Fausto says [...] "Brazilian exports had doubled in volume and had tripled in nominal value" [...] while the valuation denominated in Pounds sterling increased by over 40%. Brazil was not the only country where agriculture played an important role on exports. Around 1890, in the United States, by then the richest nation in the Americas, agricultural goods represented 80% of all its exports.|$|E

500|$|Internationally, {{the sale}} of gravity bongs is often {{prohibited}} in countries where marijuana is illegal due to its association with the herb. In the United States, under the Federal Drug Paraphernalia Statute, {{which is part of}} the Controlled Substances Act, it is illegal to sell, transport through the mail, transport across state lines, import, or export drug paraphernalia, meaning that the bong is illegal. Since Colorado, Oregon, and Washington have legalized recreational use of the herb, gravity bongs (along with other related paraphernalia) can be legally sold to anyone over the age of 21. In countries and states where use of cannabis is illegal, some retailers insist that bongs are intended for use with tobacco in an attempt to circumvent laws against selling drug paraphernalia. While technically the term [...] "bong" [...] does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> device used for smoking mainly marijuana, drug-related connotations have been formed with the word itself (partly due to punning with Sanskrit bhangah, meaning [...] "hemp"). Thus for fear of the law some head shops will not serve customers who use the word [...] "bong" [...] or [...] "bongs", typically insisting instead on the term [...] "water pipe".|$|E
500|$|When someone acts, it is {{according}} to a rule, or maxim. For Kant, an act is only permissible if one is willing for the maxim that allows the action to be a universal law by which everyone acts. Maxims fail this test if they produce either a contradiction in conception or a contradiction in the will when universalized. A contradiction in conception happens when, if a maxim were to be universalized, it ceases to make sense because the [...] "...maxim would necessarily destroy itself {{as soon as it}} was made a universal law." [...] For example, if the maxim 'It is permissible to break promises' was universalized, no one would trust any promises made, so the idea of a promise would become meaningless; the maxim would be self-contradictory because, when universalized, promises cease to be meaningful. The maxim is not moral because it is logically impossible to universalize—we could not conceive of a world where this maxim was universalized. A maxim can also be immoral if it creates a contradiction in the will when universalized. This does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> logical contradiction, but that universalizing the maxim leads to a state of affairs that no rational being would desire. For example, Driver argues that the maxim 'I will not give to charity' produces a contradiction in the will when universalized because a world where no one gives to charity would be undesirable for the person who acts by that maxim.|$|E

2500|$|In law, deceit {{and fraud}} both fall within tort {{and are also}} often crimes, while {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation is usually associated with contract law. In a claim for deceit or fraud, damages are intended to put the claimant in the position as if the tort had not been committed. [...] Therefore, a claim for damages from any of these, requires that the statement was reasonably relied on, and that this reliance led to loss or harm. The motive for dishonesty is irrelevant, so a 'good' motive (e.g. defrauding a bank to help starving children) {{does not change the}} fact of deceit or fraud.
