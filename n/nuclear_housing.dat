5000|$|A recent (2001) book {{provides}} {{an update on}} the Akan, stating that some families are changing from the above abusua structure to the <b>nuclear</b> family. <b>Housing,</b> childcare, education, daily work, and elder care etc. are then handled by that individual family, rather than by the abusua or clan, especially in the city. The above taboo on marriage within one's abusua is sometimes ignored, but [...] "clan membership" [...] is still important, with many people still living in the abusua framework presented above.|$|R

50|$|While not {{technically}} within the corporate {{limits of the}} city, Dresden Nuclear Power Plant, which provides {{a substantial portion of}} the electricity supply for the Chicago metropolitan area, has a Morris mailing address. Included among the Dresden plant's reactors is the first commercial <b>nuclear</b> reactor, <b>housed</b> in a spherical concrete and steel shell; it has since been decommissioned, and two more modern reactors (of 1970s vintage) now generate its electricity. Also nearby is the Morris Operation—the only de facto high-level radioactive waste storage site in the United States.|$|R
30|$|Renewable energy {{resources}} (RES) are the promising {{sources of energy}} for future energy demand {{in most of the}} countries in the world [1]. These resources are site specific and their size varies from few kilowatts to megawatt depending upon the availability and location. Generally power generated from them is not bulk, as compare to thermal and <b>nuclear</b> power <b>houses.</b> Therefore, they do not require long power transmission corridors for power evacuation from generating units to the load centres. This results in less investment in long transmission circuits and requires low relatively cost local distribution circuits for supply of power in the local areas.|$|R
50|$|In 1968 {{a larger}} <b>nuclear</b> bunker, <b>housing</b> the Integrated National Control Centre (INCC), was planned for Athlone. This was {{planned to have}} {{capacity}} to accommodate and feed up to 300 people for a month, and allow the Government {{to continue in the}} event of a nuclear emergency. The Department of Defence and the Office of Public Works (OPW) drew up secret plans for a larger 20,000 square foot underground bunker to include operations rooms, message centre, broadcasting studio, kitchens, offices, committee rooms, sleeping accommodation and 100,000 gallons of uncontaminated drinking water. The plans for this new bunker never went ahead.|$|R

5000|$|The Cerro Grande Fire was a {{disastrous}} forest fire in New Mexico, United States of America, {{that occurred in}} May 2000. The fire started as a controlled burn, and became uncontrolled owing to high winds and drought conditions. Over 400 families {{in the town of}} Los Alamos, New Mexico, lost their homes in the resulting 48,000-acre (190 km² = 75 mi² [...] ) fire. Structures at Los Alamos National Laboratory were also destroyed or damaged, although without loss or destruction of any of the special <b>nuclear</b> material <b>housed</b> there. There was no loss of human life. The US General Accounting Office estimated total damages at $1 billion.|$|R
50|$|After the war, {{the fort}} {{was used by}} the Royal Navy Auxiliary Service as an {{emergency}} port control centre {{in the event of a}} nuclear war. Part of the fort's disused magazine was converted into a bunker <b>housing</b> <b>nuclear</b> defence officials. The fort was decommissioned in 1956 when the UK discontinued its coastal defence programme, and the structure was sold off to the owners of the adjacent Sheerness Docks.|$|R
50|$|Advocating {{a form of}} {{cultural}} activism that was purely artist driven, the group created artworks, negotiated venues, curated shows, crafted their own PR, and engaged in discourse that responded to the political themes and predicaments of their time, among them the recessions of the 1970s, the Reagan era of budget cuts and <b>nuclear</b> armament, the <b>housing</b> crisis and gentrification in New York City, and other pressing social issues.|$|R
50|$|South Korea has a {{relatively}} {{smaller number of}} generating stations, only four, but each station houses four or more units, and three sites have more reactors planned. Thus Korea's nuclear power production is slightly more centralized than most <b>nuclear</b> power nations. <b>Housing</b> multiple units at each site allows more efficient maintenance and lower costs, but reduces grid efficiencies. Four of the six Wolsong reactors are Canadian-designed CANDU pressurized heavy-water reactors (PHWR).|$|R
5000|$|Military {{installations}} with hardened NCCs included 9 JUSS stations with partially underground Missile Master <b>nuclear</b> bunkers <b>housing</b> Martin AN/FSG-1 Antiaircraft Defense Systems {{and over}} 20 bases with above ground SAGE Direction Centers built for [...]overpressure and containing AN/FSQ-7 Combat Direction Centrals (the last completed [...] "SAGE direction center became operational at Sioux City, Iowa, in December 1961)." [...] Three SAGE DCs were collocated with SAGE Combat Centers that used AN/FSQ-8 Combat Control Centrals {{for managing the}} air battle. Solid-state Martin AN/GSG-5/6 BIRDIE systems were at Mill Valley AFS CA, Belleville AFS IL, and in Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas (2) by July 1, 1962. In 1968, 17 of the NORAD Control Centers received the new Bell 305 Switching System to use AUTOVON telecommunications for Back-Up Interceptor Control.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, Greenpeace criticised NEI's public {{relations}} efforts {{and suggested that}} NEI's advertising about nuclear power {{was an example of}} greenwashing. In the first quarter of 2008 the NEI spent $320,000 on lobbying the US federal government. Besides Congress, the nuclear group lobbied the White <b>House,</b> <b>Nuclear</b> Regulatory Commission, departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy and others {{in the first three months}} of the year. The NEI spent $1.3 million to lobby the federal government in 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{detonation}} immediately {{attracts the}} attention of the U.S. government. White <b>House</b> <b>nuclear</b> expert Dr. Julia Kelly believes that Chechen terrorists are behind the incident. U.S. Army Special Forces Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe interrupts her briefing to suggest that the crash and detonation were staged to hide the hijacking of the other warheads. A call to Devoe's long-time friend and Russian counterpart, Dimitri Vertikoff, adds credence to his hypothesis and he is assigned as Dr. Kelly's military liaison.|$|R
50|$|The caverns {{are capable}} of hiding up to 20 nuclear {{submarines}} based on reconnaissance satellites data collected.

The US Department of Defense has estimated that China will have five Type 094 nuclear submarines operational by 2010 with each capable of carrying 12 JL-2 intercontinental ballistic missiles. Two 950 metre piers and three smaller ones would be enough to accommodate two carrier strike groups or amphibious assault ships.|$|R
