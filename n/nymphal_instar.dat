50|$|In 1883, John Lubbock revitalized Harvey’s {{hypothesis}} {{and argued}} that the origin and evolution of holometabolan development {{can be explained by}} the precocious eclosion of the embryo. Hemimetabolan species, whose larvae look like the adult, have an embryo that completes all developmental stages (namely: ‘protopod’, ‘polipod’, and ‘oligopod’ stages) inside the eggshell. Holometabolan species instead have vermiform larvae and a pupal stage after incomplete development and hatching. The debate continued through the twentieth century, with some authors (like Charles Pérez in 1902) claiming the precocious eclosion theory outlandish, Antonio Berlese reestablishing it as the leading theory in 1913, and Augustus Daniel Imms disseminating it widely among Anglo-Saxon readers from 1925 (see Wigglesworth 1954 for review). One of the most contentious aspects of the precocious eclosion theory that fueled further debate in the field of evolution and development was the proposal that the hemimetabolan nymphal stages are equivalent to the holometabolan pupal stage. Critics of this theory (most notably, H.E. Hinton) argue that post-embryonic development in hemimetabolans and holometabolans are equivalent, and rather the last <b>nymphal</b> <b>instar</b> stage of hemimetabolans would be homologous to the holometabolan pupae. More modern opinions still oscillate between these two conceptions of the hemi- to holometabolan evolutionary trend.|$|E
5000|$|Tetrix ceperoi, {{commonly}} named Cepero's groundhopper, is {{a member}} of the Tetrigidae family and is very similar to common grasshoppers. Grasshopper is defined as a [...] "plant eating insect with long hind legs that are used for jumping and for producing a chirping sound". However, unlike the common grasshopper, the wings of T. ceperoi extend beyond its pronotum (the upper surface of the first segment of the thorax). The front wings have evolved throughout history to be stumps, and the back wings are very well developed. Thanks to the front wings only, T. ceperoi is capable of flying. Furthermore, T. ceperoi sports wide shoulders while covering its narrow abdomen beneath the pronotum. T. ceperoi are classified as Orthoptera, which describes crickets, grasshoppers, and locusts. Furthermore, these Orthoptera have incomplete metamorphosis, which also affects sexual dimorphism later. T. ceperoi reach an average length of about 10 mm. T. ceperoi is a multi-coloured ground dweller with the ability to blend into its surroundings. The ability of T. ceperoi to be different colours makes it able to evolve colour schemes better adapted to specific habitats. This cryptic nature of their outer layer provides protection from predators as it is able to blend into its surroundings. T. ceperoi is diurnal, which means it is solely active in the daytime. However, although it is diurnal, it continues to hibernate during a late <b>nymphal</b> <b>instar</b> or later on in life as adults.|$|E

40|$|Juvenile Hormone (JH) represses {{metamorphosis}} {{of young}} instars in insects. One {{of the main}} players in hormonal signalling is Methoprene-tolerant (Met), which {{plays the role of}} JH receptor. Using the Polyneopteran insect Blattella germanica as the model and RNAi for transcript depletion, we have confirmed that Met transduces the antimetamorphic signal of JH in young nymphs and plays a role in the last <b>nymphal</b> <b>instar</b> moult in this species. Previously, the function of Met as the JH receptor had been demonstrated in the Eumetabola clade, with experiments in Holometabola (in the beetle Tribolium castaneum) and in their sister group Paraneoptera (in the bug Pyrrhocoris apterus). Our result shows that the function of Met as JH receptor is also conserved in the more basal Polyneoptera. The function of Met as JH transducer might thus predate the evolutionary innovation of metamorphosis. Moreover, expression of Met was also found in last <b>nymphal</b> <b>instar</b> of B. germanica, when JH is absent. Depletion of Met in this stage provoked deficiencies in wing growth and ecdysis problems in the imaginal moult. Down-regulation of the ecdysone-inducible gene E 75 A and Insulin-Like-Peptide 1 in these Met-depleted specimens suggest that Met is involved in the ecdysone and insulin signalling pathways in last <b>nymphal</b> <b>instar,</b> when JH i...|$|E

Here we present quantitative results of predation of larvae of T. absoluta by nymphs and adults of Geocoris punctipes (Say). All five nymphal instars of the predator G. punctipes detect, attack and consume 1 st larval instars of T. absoluta.

40|$|Póster presentado en el 17 th International Congress of Comparative Endocrinology (ICCE 2013), celebrado en Barcelona del 15 al 19 de julio de 2013. Vitellogenesis in {{the adult}} female of Blattella germanica {{requires}} a production of juvenile hormone (JH) much higher than that required for the nymphs to inhibit metamorphosis. In this respect, an interesting question is how the JH-producing glands, that is the corpora allata (CA), can cope with this hormonal hyperproduction. In females, CA biosynthetic activity decreases to very low values {{one day after the}} ecdysis to the last <b>nymphal</b> <b>instar,</b> and one day later, CA cells underwent cell hyperproliferation. We wonder whether there is a cause-effect relationship between both events, which can afford an answer to the above question. Here, we analyze the proliferation status of CA during the penultimate (fifth) and last (sixth) <b>nymphal</b> <b>instar</b> using EdU (5 -ethynyl- 2 ́-deoxyuridine), a thymidine analog that is incorporated to the DNA during its synthesis. Nymphs of different ages of the fifth and sixth instars were injected with 1 μl of 20 mM EdU solution, dissected three hours later and processed to fluorescence detection, based on a copper-catalyzed reaction between an azida (EdU) and a alkyne (Alexa Fluor® dye). Cell proliferation in the CA of fifth instar nymphs steadily increases from the fourth (N 5 D 4) to the sixth day (N 6 D 6). Recently molted sixth instar nymphs (N 6 D 0) didn't show any proliferation in the CA, but just one day later the process starts again and reaches high levels in the second day (N 6 D 2), which are maintained until the sixth day of development (N 6 D 6). These proliferation rates are much higher than those observed in the fifth instar. Possible mechanisms by which a decrease of biosynthetic activity triggers cell hyperproliferation in CA cells in the last <b>nymphal</b> <b>instar</b> of B. germanica females will be discussed.
