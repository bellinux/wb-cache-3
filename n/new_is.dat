If GH is given to most extremely short children to make them taller, will the definition of “extremely short” simply rise, negating the expected social benefit? If GH is given to short children whose parents can afford it, will shortness become a permanent mark of lower social origins? More of these issues are outlined in the ethics section. Whole meetings were devoted to these questions; pediatric endocrinology had become a specialty with its own bioethics issues.|$|E
25|$|Hermann Ebbinghaus {{contributed a}} lot to the {{research}} of the memory of the brain. He made the first empirical study concerning the function of the memory as to the storage and forgetting of information. His major finding was that the amount of learned knowledge depends on the amount of time invested. Further, the more time that is passing by, the more repetitions that are necessary. Resulting from the findings of Ebbinghaus, the first theory of forgetting was established, the decay theory. It says that if something <b>new</b> <b>is</b> learned, a memory trace is formed. This trace will decay, if not used in the course of time, and by decaying of this trace, forgetting occurs (Weltens 1987).|$|E

Susana Novo Vásquez of The Huffington Post stated that [...] "the indisputable team of Xenomania/Girls Aloud {{have been the}} ones to set the trends over the years for others to follow," [...] adding that the song [...] "continues down that path." [...] Vásquez continued saying that the group returned into a moment where the [...] "pop scene ... isn't the same as when they left," [...] but {{thought that they were}} [...] "doing it in a very intelligent way: by adopting some of the Calvin Harris electronic massive sound that is current right now, yet creating an intricate song structure." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said that [...] "like most Girls Aloud singles, a few listens are required to get our heads around it." [...] Copsey criticized the distorted vocals and the fact that [...] "there probably won't be a full album of new tracks to accompany it," [...] but admitted that [...] "it sounds modern enough for today's charts without compromising their signature sound" [...] and praised its [...] "massive chorus." [...] Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media thought that the track [...] "is a game approximation of the Girls Aloud of seven years ago," [...] while BBC Music reviewer Ian Wade concluded that, [...] "as its title suggests, Something <b>New</b> <b>is</b> just that, a fanfare-like call to arms announcing the group’s return." ...|$|E
500|$|For [...] "Hollywood", {{he used a}} drum kit and {{percussion}} from an E-mu Emulator {{and also}} added extra drum sounds to give the song an old, disco vibe. Wanting to have a loud bass synth sound,, Ahmadzaï used a Nord Lead synthesizer with lot of filtering manipulations. But he faced problems with it, so he used a Yamaha O2R mixer. He did not want [...] "Hollywood" [...] to sound like the music being played at the nightclubs, so he recorded Madonna's vocals with heavy compression in her headphones. Two machines {{were used for the}} vocal editing in [...] "Hollywood". Madonna preferred the Antares Auto-Tune plug in, while Ahmadzaï chose an AMS pitch shifter. Madonna wanted Auto-Tune because she wanted [...] "Hollywood" [...] to have a more dance-like feel to it, although Ahmadzaï was against it. The track [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] had gentle vocals, then the singing was frozen using a Roland VP-9000. When Madonna sings [...] "Aaaaaahhhhhh", the vocals freeze and the process sounds natural, but in reality is not. When it came to adding the beats, he experimented by programming the drums in Logic Pro and changing the timing of the beats. The producer combines different samples of songs from his own collections and keeps on trying until something <b>new</b> <b>is</b> developed. The mixing for the tracks was done by Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent at the Westlake Recording Studios at West Hollywood, California, while Tim Young did the mastering of the songs at Metropolis Studios in London. Michael Colombier did the string arrangement with Geoff Foster acting as the strings engineer, conducting at AIR Studios.|$|E
500|$|Cisneros often {{incorporates}} Spanish {{into her}} English writing, substituting Spanish words for English ones where {{she feels that}} Spanish better conveys the meaning or improves {{the rhythm of the}} passage. However, where possible she constructs sentences so that non-Spanish speakers can infer the meaning of Spanish words from their context. In Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories Cisneros writes: [...] "La Gritona. Such a funny name for such a lovely arroyo. But that's what they called the creek that ran behind the house." [...] Even if the English-speaking reader does not initially know that arroyo means creek, Cisneros soon translates {{it in a way that}} does not interrupt the flow of the text. She enjoys manipulating the two languages, creating new expressions in English by literally translating Spanish phrases. In the same book Cisneros writes: [...] "And at the next full moon, I gave light, Tía Chucha holding up our handsome, strong-lunged boy." [...] Previous sentences inform the reader that a baby is being born, but only a Spanish speaker will notice that [...] "I gave light" [...] is a literal translation of the Spanish [...] "dí a luz" [...] which means [...] "I gave birth." [...] Cisneros joins other Hispanic-American US writers such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Piri Thomas, Giannina Braschi, Gustavo Pérez Firmat, and Junot Díaz, who create playful linguistic hybrids of Spanish and English. Cisneros noted on this process: [...] "All of a sudden something happens to the English, something really <b>new</b> <b>is</b> happening, a new spice is added to the English language." [...] Spanish always has a role in Cisneros's work, even when she writes in English. As she discovered, after writing The House on Mango Street primarily in English, [...] "the syntax, the sensibility, the diminutives, the way of looking at inanimate objects" [...] were all characteristic of Spanish. For Cisneros, Spanish brings to her work not only colorful expressions, but also a distinctive rhythm and attitude.|$|E
