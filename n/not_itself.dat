5|$|A {{person can}} obtain more {{or all of}} the {{categories}} at once. But the set of categories needs to be known before the exam and highest score needs to be met. Typically, people obtain E and B category because these two categories provides the best versatility (almost any firearm can be owned and carried concealed). The D category is required by the law for the members of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license for on duty firearms) and does <b>not</b> <b>itself</b> permit private gun ownership (unless the person obtains also other license category).|$|E
5|$|A small {{model of}} this toy is {{exhibited}} in Tipu Sultan's wooden palace in Bangalore. Although other items associated with Tipu, including his sword, {{have recently been}} purchased and brought back to India by billionaire Vijay Mallya, Tipu's Tiger has <b>not</b> <b>itself</b> {{been the subject of}} an official repatriation request, presumably due to the ambiguity underlying Tipu's image in the eyes of Indians; his being an object of loathing in the eyes of some Indians while considered a hero by others.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic scallop does <b>not</b> <b>itself</b> {{have many}} predators and large {{individuals}} are adept at jumping and swimming to escape attackers. Any attached juveniles benefit from this. However, the scallops are intolerant of low salinity levels, and mortality sometimes occurs {{as a result}} of a pool of relatively fresh water that sometimes forms during the summer months under the sea ice as it melts.|$|E

However, it is being studied for its potential use in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease. Evidence on the benefit of NAD in neurodegeneration is mixed; some studies in mice have produced promising results whereas a placebo-controlled clinical trial in humans failed to show any effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{final case}} in which the Supreme Court upheld Section 5 was Lopez v. Monterey County (Lopez II) (1999). In Lopez II, the Court reiterated its {{reasoning}} in Katzenbach and Rome, and it upheld as constitutional the requirement that covered local governments obtain preclearance before implementing voting changes that their parent state required them to implement, even if the parent state was <b>not</b> <b>itself</b> a covered jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is <b>not</b> <b>itself</b> a cut. A minimal cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E

For the instrument of knowledge itself falls under the category of objects. The knower may desire to know, <b>not</b> about <b>itself,</b> but about objects. As fire does <b>not</b> burn <b>itself,</b> so the self does <b>not</b> know <b>itself</b> and the knower can have no knowledge of a thing that is not its object.

5|$|Agârbiceanu's {{old and new}} {{writings}} {{came out}} in several editions: Pagini alese ("Selected Works", 1956), Din munți și din câmpii ("From Mountains and Plains", 1957), Din copilărie ("Childhood Memories", 1957), File din cartea naturii ("Pages from the Book of Nature", 1959), Povestind copiilor ("Stories for Children", 1961) and Faraonii ("The Pharaohs", 1961). Although formally congratulated by the regime, Agârbiceanu fell out with its censorship apparatus. According to various accounts, he allowed the censors to operate multiple changes, {{as long as the}} substance of his writing was <b>not</b> <b>itself</b> altered. Portions of his work were cut out during reediting, and a novel, Prăbușirea ("The Downfall"), serialized in Gazeta Literară, was so crudely handled that seven of its pages were lost forever.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{rebellion}} did <b>not</b> <b>itself</b> achieve lasting success, {{it is commonly}} cited as a watershed moment in Nyasaland history. The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness, has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.|$|E

5|$|The long-time {{informal}} {{emblem of}} the Tortoise Club (1st Summer VIII and 1st Torpid crews), was formalized in a grant to the College by Letters Patent dated 20 April 2009 of Garter, Clarenceux and Norroy and Ulster King of Arms. The Badge is blazoned A Tortoise displayed the shell circular Azure charged with two concentric annulets Argent. The grant is formulated to provide the College, the Boat Club, and the Oriel Society (Oriel's Alumni society) use of the badge in relation to Tortoise Club alumni activities; the Tortoise Club is <b>not</b> <b>itself</b> an incorporated entity and does not bear Arms in its own right; therefore {{it could not be}} granted such a heraldic Badge directly.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{both sexes}} in both species are almost identical, with the only {{difference}} being iris colour in the lesser melampitta, the male having a red iris and the female a brown one. The plumage of juvenile lesser melampittas {{is the same as}} adults except they are brown on the lower body. Several researchers have noted that the plumage of juvenile greater melampittas resembles that of the hooded pitohui. Hooded pitohuis are unusual for birds in having a toxin, homobatrachotoxin, in their feathers and skin which can cause convulsions and death if consumed. The resemblance is probably an example of Batesian mimicry as the greater melampitta is <b>not</b> <b>itself</b> poisonous.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December 2010, a {{week after}} the ICC Prosecutor {{announced}} the individuals he was seeking to prosecute, the Kenyan National Assembly passed a motion seeking to withdraw Kenya as a State Party to the Rome Statute, the treaty which established the International Criminal Court. The motion, which was introduced by Assembly Member Isaac Ruto had previously been thrown out of the National Assembly by Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim who ruled it was unconstitutional; however an amended version was introduced the following day and passed. During the debate, the Minister for Energy Kiraitu Murungi claimed the ICC was a colonialist, imperialist court. This motion did <b>not</b> <b>itself</b> affect Kenya's status as a State Party to the Rome Statute, but rather obliges ministers to move to repeal Kenya's International Crimes Act which ratified the Rome Statute and made necessarily changes to Kenyan's criminal code. In February 2011, Kenya appealed to the United Nations Security Council, asking it to defer the trials at The Hague. Some critics in Kenya have also questioned the constitutionality of the Rome Statute, arguing that it is incompatible with the Constitution of Kenya, which was passed by a referendum in 2010.|$|E

5|$|The John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer is an American award given {{annually}} {{to the best}} new writer whose first professional work of science fiction or fantasy was published within the two previous calendar years. The prize is {{named in honor of}} science fiction editor and writer John W. Campbell, whose science fiction writing and role as editor of Analog Science Fiction and Fact {{made him one of the}} most influential editors in the early history of science fiction. The award is sponsored by Dell Magazines, which publishes Analog. The nomination and selection process is administered by the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) represented by the current Worldcon committee, and the award is presented at the Hugo Award ceremony at the Worldcon, although it is <b>not</b> <b>itself</b> a Hugo Award. All nominees receive a pin, while the winner receives a plaque. Beginning in 2005, the award has also included a tiara; created at the behest of 2004 winner Jay Lake and 2005 winner Elizabeth Bear, the tiara is passed from each year's winner to the next.|$|E
