40|$|As a {{response}} to ongoing sea level rise, crest levels of sea defences need to be raised in future at huge expenditure and with increased risk. As an alternative, dikes can be strengthened as to accommodate for increased wave overtopping. Within the ComCoast program (a European project between governments along the North Sea for innovative solutions {{for the safety of}} sea defences) research has been done on overtopping-resistant sea defences and ideas for different types of reinforcements have been generated. A concept with a specific geosynthetic that reinforces the crest and inner slope of the dikes was awarded for installation at a sea dike in the Netherlands in 2006. The actual field tests took place early 2007. These tests are unique in their kind as they have been carried out on a real dike under full scale wave overtopping conditions, far beyond present standards. As a result, the erosive impact of wave overtopping on the <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> <b>covered</b> dike section, on the reinforcement section, as well as on a bare clay layer section, has been investigated under representative wave overtopping conditions. This paper describes the results of these field tests, i. e. the strength response of the dike slopes and indicates the follow-up and potentials of the results obtained thus far...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} human kinetics {{in relation}} to golf shoe outer sole design features during the golf swing using a driver club by measuring both within the shoe, and beneath the shoe at the <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> interface. Three different shoes were assessed: metal 7 - spike shoe, alternative 7 -spike shoe, and a flat soled shoe. In-shoe plantar pressure data were recorded using Footscan RS International pressure insoles and sampling at 500 Hz. Simultaneously ground reaction force at the shoe outer sole was measured using 2 <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> <b>covered</b> Kistler force platforms and 1000 Hz data acquisition. Video recording of the 18 right-handed golfers at 200 Hz was undertaken while the golfer performed 5 golf shots with his own driver in each type of shoe. Front foot (nearest to shot direction) maximum vertical force and torque were greater than at the back foot, {{and there was no}} significant difference related to the shoe type. Wearing the metal spike shoe when using a driver was associated with more torque generation at the back foot (p < 0. 05) than when the flat soled shoe was worn. Within shoe regional pressures differed significantly with golf shoe outer sole design features (p < 0. 05). Comparison of the metal spike and alternative spike shoe results provided indications of the quality of regional traction on the outer sole. Potential golf shoe outer sole design features and traction were presented {{in relation to}} phases of the golf swing movement. Application of two kinetic measurement methods identified that moderated (adapted) muscular control of foot and body movement may be induced by golf shoe outer sole design features.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out during two years (2004 and 2005) at Bairrada Delimited Region (littoral/centre of Portugal) with the white {{cultivar}} “Fernão Pires” {{for the evaluation of}} the effects of tillage application in a non-irrigated commercial vineyard with a long term natural cover crop. In the two years of the experiment, during the growing season the climate was dry, especially in 2005. Consequently, a moderate to severe water stress was observed during ripening,, although little differences between <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> <b>covered</b> and tilled treatments were found, according to predawn leaf water potential evolution. Vine nutritional status was also improved by tillage and, therefore, higher net photosynthetic rates were verifi ed. Tillage induced higher vegetative growth, particularly on lateral shoots that led to a denser and more shaded canopy. Hence bunch rot (Botrytis cinerea Pers.) intensity was signifi cantly higher in the tilled treatment in 2004 due to important rainfall events in summer. However, in hot and dry summers, as in 2005, higher vigour induced by tillage was crucial to reduce bunch sunburn injuries. The yield was signifi cantly increased in 2005 in tilled treatment (around 100 %) because of higher fertility index, which result from the better nutritional status and vigour of previous year, bunch and berry weight, and also from the decrease of sunburn injuries. Lower effects of treatments were observed in the must composition. In 2005, even with a strong yield increase caused by tillage, the soil management techniques did not infl uenced the nutritional must composition...|$|R

40|$|Reforestation {{with trees}} and shrubs may be an {{effective}} means of increasing soil organic matter content and for regeneration of degraded lands. A study was conducted on a degraded farmland Chromic Luvisol (UNESCO/FAO) or Udic Rhodustalf (USDA, 1999) in the moist semi decidu-ous zone of West Africa, near Onwe, located at latitude 06 o 41 ’ N, longitude 01 o 28 ’ W, and at an altitude of 305 m asl. The objective {{of the study was to}} quantify the improvement in soil physico-chemical properties of degraded Chromic Luvisol with exotic leguminous tree species compared to grass vegetation in the moist semi-deciduous zone of West Africa. To quantify changes due to reforestation, we measured some physical and chemical properties of soil after 20 years (1989 – 2009) of reforestation with Acacia angustissima (Acacia), Cassia siamea (Cassia), and Leucaena leucocephala (Leucaena) mixed and compared with soils under natural grass vegetation. Experi-mental design used for soil sampling and for evaluating the soil properties was randomized com-plete block with three replications. Soil organic matter increased from 1. 19 % to 2. 02 % while pH dropped from 5. 65 to 4. 79 in the reforested soils. Cumulative infiltration, infiltration rate, and gravimetric water content showed significant improvement under reforestation compared with soils under natural vegetation. Total porosity increased from 36. 7 % in the <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> to 51. 3 % in the reforested soils. Reforestation resulted in significant reduction in bulk density from 1. 67 to 1. 26 g/cm 3. Improvement of soil properties under reforestation indicates that planting of well-adapted and fast-growing exotic tree species can gradually improve soil quality and regen-erate degraded lands. Reforestation may be thus recommended as a way of regenerating de-graded land...|$|E
40|$|The study, {{throughout}} {{two years}} (2004 and 2005), of different systems of soil management, {{as well as}} different basal leaf removal modalities, effects on the white variety ‘Fernão Pires’, {{took place in a}} vineyard pertaining to Sogrape Vinhos, SA, located in the Bairrada Demarcated Region (littoral/centre of Portugal). Two techniques of soil management between rows were applied: the permanent <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> and tillage, both with application of herbicide on the row. In 2004, basal leaf removal was carried through at veraison on the two sides of canopy or only on the East side. In 2005, other basal leaf removal modalities were introduced, at pea size or at veraison, applied only on one or two faces of canopy. In the two years of the experiment, the climate during the vegetative cycle was dry, especially in 2005. In consequence the predawn leaf water potential reached very low values along ripening and differences between grass covered and tilled treatments have not been registered. Higher net photosynthetic rates were obtained in tilled treatment, probably due to greater magnesium content in the leaves. Grass cover conduced to a less dense canopy, especially in 2005, by a reduction of the leaf layer number (LLN), higher penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at cluster zone and in 2005, provoked a drastic increase on the proportion of sunburned leaves and scalded clusters. On the other hand, basal leaf removal also modified the canopy structure, reducing its density, particularly in 2004. In this year, high bunch rot (Botrytis cinerea L.) incidence occurred and the reduction of canopy density had an important role on it’s the decrease. In 2004, yield components hadn’t been significantly affected by any of the factors in study. However in 2005, although basal leaf removal haven’t influenced yield, grass cover strongly reduced it (about 50 %). Vigour reduction was verified in both years only by grass cover. Small differences between treatments were found in what concerns to must composition. At harvest in 2005, soil management techniques didn’t influenced nutritional cluster compositio...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce golf turf damage the {{traditional}} metal spike golf shoe has been redesigned, but shoe-ground biomechanical evaluations have utilised artificial grass surfaces. Twenty-four golfers wore three different golf shoe traction designs (traditional metal spikes, alternative spikes, and a flat-soled shoe with no additional traction) when performing shots with a driver, 3 iron and 7 iron. Ground action forces were measured beneath the feet by two <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> <b>covered</b> force platforms. The maximum vertical force recorded at the back foot with the 3 iron and 7 iron was 0. 82 BW (body weight) and at the front foot 1. 1 BW approximately in both the metal spike and alternative spike golf shoe designs. When using the driver these maximal vertical values were 0. 49 BW at the back foot and 0. 84 BW at the front foot. Furthermore, as performance of the backswing and then downswing necessitates a change in movement direction the range of force generated during the complete swing was calculated. In the metal spike shoe the vertical force generated at the back foot with both irons was 0. 67 BW and at the front foot 0. 96 BW with the 3 iron and 0. 92 BW with the 7 iron. The back foot vertical force generated with the driver was 0. 33 BW and at the front foot 0. 83 BW wearing the metal spike shoe. Results indicated the greater force generation with the irons. When using the driver the more horizontal swing plane associated with the longer club reduced vertical forces at the back and front foot. However, the mediolateral force generated across each foot in the metal and alternative spike shoes when using the driver was greater than when the irons were used. The coefficient of friction was 0. 62 at the back and front foot whichever shoe was worn or club use...|$|R

Who {{would believe}} {{nowadays}} a mere animal {{can compete with}} the power of human engineering. This thesis has the objective {{to examine the effects of}} modern technology in viticulture in comparison to an old fashioned way of working with draft animals such as horses. Analyses were carried out during nine months and one vintage in two different vineyards with differences in cultivation practices with horses as draft animals on mostly bare soil or tractors with an alternate <b>natural</b> <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> in the wine region Palatinate, Germany. Soil textures are the same in both comparable sites. The vineyard which was cultivated with horses is referred as vineyard horse and the vineyard which is cultivated mechanically is referred as vineyard tractor. Organic matter shows higher contents in the vineyard horse in topsoil as well as in subsoil. The C/N Ratio shows no big differences. Mineral contents of soil were measured as nitrogen, phosphor, potassium and magnesium with differences in values. The vineyard tractor counts with a higher average number of clusters per vine. Differences in percentage regarding total botrytis are minimal and vineyards show a higher infestation frequency in the vineyard horse but the infestation strength within the grape is lower in this vineyard. The cultivation with horses show higher values as density level, degree in Oechsle, total extract, pH, total acidity, tartaric acid and malic acid. The analyses of nutrients in must show higher contents of macronutrients in the vineyard horse as nitrogen, phosphor, potassium, calcium, sodium and magnesium. Very high differences can be found within the amounts of nitrogen. The micronutrients in must such as iron, zinc, manganese and copper resulted in very similar values. The labor in working with draft animals in vineyards is more than two times higher compared to the vineyard that is mechanized. It is necessary to get a more detailed view including more vintages and more vineyards which can be analyzed in order to come to a more scientifically sound conclusion. N/...|$|E

In 2011, 2012 and 2013, yield, average drupe weight, percentage of drupe black color (veraison), trunk circumference, shoot elongation, and leaf relative water content (RWC) were determined on 34 adult trees of the cultivar 'Biancolilla' with uniform size and age. In 2013, soil organic matter content and leaf nutrient concentrations were also determined in the two portions of the grove. As expected, permanent <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> increased soil organic matter especially in May and in the first 15 cm of soil.

The objective of the research reported in this paper {{was to develop a}} continuous rainfall-runoff-soil erosion model to investigate <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> effects on runoff and soil loss on railway formation steep slopes. It utilizes the Saint Venant continuity and momentum equations for overland flow, and a modified Green-Ampt model for infiltration on steep slopes. The erosion component of the model consists of two different methods, based on (1) the modified universal soil loss equation, and (2) steep slope erosion dynamics. The efficiency of the model was evaluated by the percentage error and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values. Field trials data gathered from 10 -m wide sections with different <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> percentages were used to calibrate the one-dimensional distributed rainfall-runoff model. Rainfall and runoff were monitored at 1 -min intervals while the soil loss data were collected at different sampling intervals. The model has successfully predicted runoff and soil loss from the plots {{for the majority of the}} cases, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values varying between 0. 43 and 0. 99 for 0 % <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> plots, 0. 06 and 0. 97 for 50 % <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> plots, and − 0. 42 to 0. 94 for 100 % <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> plots.

This paper focuses on GI with mixed <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> {{in the presence of}} trees. Due to shading effects (interception of radiant energy) of tree canopy, mixed <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> in the vicinity of trees may not receive direct photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). This can hinder the growth rates resulting in the low <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> (i. e., in density). The hydraulic conductivity and the performance of GI can be further affected.

However, any variation in growth and hydraulic conductivity of mixed <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> in the vicinity of trees was rarely investigated. The objective {{of this study is to}} quantify spatial and temporal variation of vegetation growth and hydraulic conductivity in a mixed <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> in the vicinity of a tree. Field monitoring of a mixed <b>grass</b> <b>cover</b> in the vicinity of a tree in a GI was conducted for about six months.
