40|$|AbstractHard {{turning process}} is {{currently}} replacing the conventional grinding operations in many industries. If properly designed, hard turning can give equivalent results to grinding process {{in terms of}} accuracy and machined surface quality. Wiper inserts are being used in machining operations because of their competence to generate superior machined surface. Surface roughness is major requirement for many industrial components {{and is one of}} the important parameter considered to describe machinability of metals and metal alloys. This paper investigates performance of wiper inserts in hard turning of oil hardening <b>non-shrinking</b> steel. The oil hardening <b>non-shrinking</b> steel is commonly used material for making measuring instruments and gauges wherein surface roughness is very important aspect. The major emphasis here is given to study and compare performance of wiper insert in terms of surface finish with conventional inserts. Influence of process parameters such as speed, feed, depth of cut and nose radius (for wiper and conventional inserts) on surface roughness is analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of means (AOM) plots. From the analysis, it can be clearly seen that wiper inserts produce a very good machined surface compared to conventional inserts...|$|R

The osteosarcoma BS 2 showed no significant drop in sensitization for 2 fractions compared with a single dose. The rapidly shrinking carcinoma NT and the <b>non-shrinking</b> fibrosarcoma showed a significant drop in the SER as the radiation dose was fractionated. This is consistent with effective reoxygenation occurring in both tumours. No sensitizing effect was observed in the fibrosarcoma for 5 fractions each given with metronidazole.

5000|$|For {{dowel bar}} retrofit, dowels, bond breaker, {{expansion}} caps, dowel bar support chairs, foam core insert, caulking filler, <b>non-shrink</b> concrete backfill material and submittals are needed. The dowels {{need to be}} smooth, round, epoxy and made of bond breaker coated steel conforming to requirements. The bond breaker {{is to be applied}} on all surfaces of the dowel bar. The expansion caps belong {{at each end of the}} dowel bar and the dowel bar support chairs are used to firmly hold the dowels centered in the slots during backfill operations. The foam core insert is used to re-establish the joint or crack, which allows the bar within each side of the slot to expand and contract. The caulking filler is used to prevent backfill material from flowing into the joint or crack. <b>Non-shrink</b> concrete backfill material that is tested as rapid set concrete patching materials is recommended for use on DBR projects.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example is}} {{to modify the}} roto-milling head to create slots in {{concrete}} slabs for the dowel bar retrofit process. The typical process is to saw cut and jackhammer out the slots for the dowels. Following dowel placement, the slots are then typically backfilled with a <b>non-shrink</b> concrete mixture, and the pavement is diamond-ground to restore smoothness. This special milling process shortens the time to create slots from the traditional method which is labor-intensive.|$|E

40|$|Prestressing cables {{are widely}} used in huge constructions like {{buildings}} and bridges. Corrosion of prestressing steel is more dangerous than the corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete. Stress corrosion is propagated due to corrosion initiation in prestressing steel under stressed condition. Corrosion resistance of the prestressing steel depends upon the grout material. In this investigation three types of grout materials namely cement grout with <b>non-shrinking</b> admixture, polyurethane foam and epoxy grout were assessed for its suitability within the prestressing cable duct. The performance of grout materials to protect against prestressing steel corrosion was evaluated by different electrochemical techniques such as OCP measurements, anodic polarisation test and impressed voltage technique. The mechanical property of the different grout materials were test at room and elevated temperature. Among the three grouts, epoxy based grout system showed better corrosion resistance properties...|$|R

In this paper we consider a discrete Willmore energy and its flow. In contrast to traditional approaches it is not based on a finite element discretization, but rather on an ab initio discrete formulation which preserves the Möbius symmetries of the underlying continuous theory in the discrete setting. We derive the relevant gradient expressions including a linearization (approximation of the Hessian), which are required for non-linear numerical solvers.

50|$|A {{dowel bar}} {{retrofit}} (DBR) {{is a method}} of reinforcing cracks in highway pavement by inserting steel dowel bars in slots cut across the cracks. It is a technique several states have successfully used to address faulting in older jointed plain concrete pavements. The typical approach is to saw cut and jackhammer out the slots for the dowels. Following dowel placement the slots are then typically backfilled with a <b>non-shrink</b> concrete mixture (grout) and the pavement is diamond-ground to restore smoothness.|$|E
50|$|Dowel Bar Retrofit (DBR) is {{a process}} that re-establishes load {{transfer}} capability on doweled joints and cracks by installing epoxy-coated, round steel dowels into existing concrete pavement across transverse joints and/or cracks. Slots are cut using diamond-tipped saw blades; the existing concrete is removed and the dowels are placed in the slots across the joints or cracks. The slots are then backfilled with a <b>non-shrink</b> grout and the pavement is diamond ground to restore smoothness. The diamond grinding removes excess grout and any displacement of panels. The entire road is often diamond ground to remove bumps or dips and provide a safe, quiet riding surface. In Wisconsin, researchers found that the overall accident rate for diamond ground surfaces was only 60 percent of the rate for the non-ground surfaces.|$|E

30|$|The latest {{development}} in nonwoven barrier fabrics is the siliconized thermally bonded highloft barrier material. The siliconized highloft is {{a blend of}} three different types of siliconized fibers (e.g., Basofil®, Tencel® and Protex®) held together with a low-melt polyester ([Hendermann & Bridges 2006]). Each component of the blend provides a specific and necessary functionality to the barrier material. The siliconized melamine fibers provide a <b>non-shrinking</b> form of carbon, whereas the regenerated cellulosic fiber improves the softness and water repellency of the blend. The regenerated cellulosic fiber is very cost effective and can be used to increase the bulk of the product. Siliconized modacrylic fiber, when used in an appropriate blend ratio, can reduce the local oxygen content within the barrier during a fire, thereby prolonging char oxidation. The low melt polyester provides resiliency to the barrier, and its strong thermoplastic character helps to maintain the structural integrity of the char formed.|$|R

As {{the first line of}} defense for the corrosion protection of the stressing anchorage, a quality stressing pocket patch is essential for the long-term durability of the post-tensioning system. A premixed cementitious <b>non-shrink</b> grout described in the following and applied correctly to a well-prepared surface is required for filling single-strand tendon stressing pockets. A product best suited as a patch material is a high-quality premixed cementitious chloride-free <b>non-shrink</b> grout, mixed with limited amount of water per manufacturers’ recommendation for use as repair material. These repair grouts are designed specifically for filling concrete voids in vertical and overhead applications and are suitable for filling single-strand stressing pockets. All major cementitious material suppliers have prepackaged <b>non-shrink</b> grouts. The key to a quality stressing pocket patch is the use of the right patch material, the recommended surface preparation, and the proper mixing and application. These repair grouts must be mixed, applied, and cured per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Stressing pockets should be free from all PT coating, grease, form release agents, dirt, loose concrete, debris, or any deleterious material. Although it is accepted practice to place a small amount of PT coating or grease on the tip of the pocket former that is inserted into the anchor wedge cavity (particularly with standard nonencapsulated anchorages), any portion of the pocket former that comes into contact with the surrounding concrete should be free from all PT coating, grease, and form release. The inside surface of the pocket former recess should be cleaned with a wire brush or similar to ensure the proper bond of the patch material; a bonding agent may be applied. The recess must be immediately protected with filling material. An inspection of the surface preparation and filling of the anchorage pockets is highly desirable...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the {{development}} of contraction stress of three composite resin restorative materials during photo-polymerization: a micro-hybrid composite (Filtek Z 250, 3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA); a nano-filled composite (Filtek Supreme, 3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA); and a low-shrinkage composite (Ælite LS, Bisco Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA). Methods: Curing shrinkage stress was measured using a stress-analyzer. Composites were polymerized with a halogen-curing unit (VIP, Bisco Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA) for 40 s. The contraction force (N) generated during polymerization was continuously recorded for 150 s after photo-initiation. Contraction stress (MPa) was calculated at 20, 40, 60 and 150 s. Data were statistically analyzed. Results: The low-shrinkage composite Ælite LS exhibited the lowest stress values compared to other materials (p < 0. 05). Statistical analysis did not show significant differences between Filtek Z 250 and Filtek Supreme. Significance: The low-shrinkage composite showed lower contraction stress than micro-hybrid and nano-filled composite.

40|$|Nanoscale {{polishing}} finds {{application in}} medical, industrial, telecommunication, optics, electronics and military fields. However, rigid tool based methods, such as diamond turning, grinding and honing, have inherent limitations in creating nanopolished surfaces in hard and profiled surfaces.

40|$|Abstract: Clay {{and soil}} {{containing}} it have shrinkage curves that are qualitatively different in shape. The {{objective of this}} work is to qualitatively show with maximum simplicity, how a clay shrinkage curve turns into a soil shrinkage curve. Be-cause of the crack volume the measured shrinkage curve is not the single-valued feature of a soil. We use a concept of the reference shrinkage curve that is only stipulated by soil shrinkage without cracking, single-valued, and qualitatively simi-lar to an observed shrinkage curve. We also use new concepts of an intra-aggregate soil structure: (i) a deformable, but <b>non-shrinking</b> surface layer of aggregates that loses water during shrinkage; and (ii) lacunar pores (micro-cracks) inside an intra-aggregate clay that increase in volume during shrinkage. Then, {{through a series of}} consecutive steps, illustrating each step by a separate graphic presentation, we move from a clay shrinkage curve to a soil shrinkage curve with pre-dicted qualitative features that coincide with those experimentally observed in numerous soil shrinkage publications. We thereby demonstrate the qualitative physical impact of the intra-aggregate structure on soil shrinkage...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{hydraulic}} cement grouts are approved for Iowa Department of Transportation projects {{on the basis}} of a pullout test. However, other properties of the grouts should be evaluated. Therefore, this research was initiated to develop criteria to better evaluate {{hydraulic cement}} grouts. Fourteen grouts were tested for compressive strength, time of set, durability, consistency and shrinkage. Tested grouts all yielded compressive strengths higher than 3000 psi at 7 days and durability factors were well above 70. Time of set and consistency was adequate. The testing showed most grouts tested shrank, even though tested grouts were labeled <b>non-shrink</b> grouts. For many applications of grouts such as setting in anchor bolts and as a filler, minor shrinkage is not a problem. However, for some critical applications, shrinkage cannot be tolerated. The proposed Instructional Memorandum will identify those grouts which do not excessively shrink or expand in the tests used. Based on test results, criteria for evaluation of hydraulic cement grouts have been recommended.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} of alumina ceramics {{based on}} powders with a varying grain size has been investigated. Both commercial alumina powders and those fabricated by denitration of aluminum salts in high-frequency discharge plasma were used. It is {{shown that the}} variation of the sintering temperature and morphology of the initial powders of the particles leads to a change of the pore structure of ceramics from pore isolated clusters to a structure consisting of a ceramic skeleton and a large pore space. Changing the type of pore structure occurs at about 50 % of porosity. The ceramic pore size distribution is bimodal.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, impact of {{shrinkage}} on pyrolysis of biomass particles is studied employing a kinetic model coupled with heat transfer model using a practically significant kinetic scheme consisting of physically measurable parameters. The numerical model {{is used to}} examine the impact of shrinkage on temperature profile and pyrolysis conversion time considering cylindrical geometry. Finite difference pure implicit scheme utilizing TDMA is employed for solving heat transfer model equation. Runge-Kutta 4 th order method is used for chemical kinetics model equations. Simulations are carried out for radius ranging from 0. 0000125 m to 0. 025 m, temperature ranging from 303 K to 1100 K and shrinkage factors ranging from 0. 0 to 1. 0. The results obtained in the present study are in excellent agreement with many experimental studies, much better than the agreement with the earlier models reported in the literature. The impact of shrinkage reflects on pyrolysis in several ways. The temperature profile of the particle changes due to increased density and decreased distance across the pyrolysis region. The magnitude of the temperature gradient is more for shrinking particle as compared to <b>non-shrinking</b> particle. Shrinkage affects the pyrolysis time in thermally thick regime.

40|$|The <b>non-shrinking</b> {{property}} of silicon-infiltrated silicon carbide (SiSiC) makes it ideal {{for the production}} of larger and complex shaped ceramic components. However, its industrial realisation often fails due to the high level of manufacturing expenditure, based on process-related uncertainties and high device-related expenses. The focus of this thesis is the creation of scientific and technical requirements for the development of innovative manufacturing processes for such structural ceramics. These have to guarantee a high degree of process reliability and reproductibility as well as to hold its ground in the economic competition with other technologies. The crucial issue is the implementation of polymer concrete casting techniques on ceramic moulding during the manufacturing process. Hereby, a polymer concrete formation consisting of a mixture of SiC powders and a special binding agent was developed. This formation can be casted in an open mold without pressure followed by a curing stage. After curing, the polymer concrete can be converted into SiSiC by a pyrolisis and a reaction bonding process with liquid silicon. This casting technique enables the easy production of large and complex shaped components especially with undercuts and wall thickness differences. In addition to the production method, this work also discusses the mechanical properties of the resulting ceramics and demonstrates possible applications with a realisation of a ceramic radial flow pump impeller...|$|R
40|$|Consider the Maximum Weight Independent Set {{problem for}} rectangles: given {{a family of}} {{weighted}} axis-parallel rectangles in the plane, find a maximum-weight subset of non-overlapping rectangles. The problem is notoriously hard both in the approximation and in the parameterized setting. The best known polynomial-time approximation algorithms achieve super-constant approximation ratios [Chalermsook & Chuzhoy, Proc. SODA 2009; Chan & Har-Peled, Discrete & Comp. Geometry, 2012], {{even though there is}} a (1 +epsilon) -approximation running in quasi-polynomial time [Adamaszek & Wiese, Proc. FOCS 2013; Chuzhoy & Ene, Proc. FOCS 2016]. When parameterized by the target size of the solution, the problem is W[1]-hard even in the unweighted setting [Marx, ESA 2005]. To achieve tractability, we study the following shrinking model: one is allowed to shrink each input rectangle by a multiplicative factor 1 -delta for some fixed delta > 0, but the performance is still compared against the optimal solution for the original, <b>non-shrunk</b> instance. We prove that in this regime, the problem admits an EPTAS with running time f(epsilon,delta) n^{O(1) }, and an FPT algorithm with running time f(k,delta) n^{O(1) }, in the setting where a maximum-weight solution of size at most k is to be computed. This improves and significantly simplifies a PTAS given earlier for this problem [Adamaszek, Chalermsook & Wiese, Proc. APPROX/RANDOM 2015], and provides the first parameterized results for the shrinking model. Furthermore, we explore kernelization in the shrinking model, by giving efficient kernelization procedures for several variants of the problem when the input rectangles are squares...|$|R
