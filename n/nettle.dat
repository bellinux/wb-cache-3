5000|$|<b>Nettles</b> is the {{youngest}} of four sons of George Lee <b>Nettles</b> (1894-1969) and the former Blanche Sheffield (1908-1995). [...] He was born in Monroeville in Monroe County in south Alabama. His brothers are David Miller <b>Nettles</b> (1930-1981), George Clay <b>Nettles</b> (born 1932), and Joe Lee <b>Nettles</b> (born 1933).

5|$|Foraging {{is mainly}} on the ground, and the bird's diet {{consists}} mainly of seeds. Oily seeds, {{such as those of}} brassicas, are ignored in favour of more starchy items. Typical food plants include common <b>nettle,</b> docks, common knotgrass, fat hen, common chickweed and yarrow. Grasses are also important, particularly cereals, and grain makes up {{a significant part of the}} food consumed in autumn and winter, wheat and oats being preferred to barley. When not breeding, yellowhammers forage in flocks which can occasionally number hundreds of birds, and often contain other buntings and finches.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and horsetail and <b>nettle</b> contain up to 80 ppm.|$|E
5|$|Clover, sorrel, <b>nettle</b> and thistle are common, {{and grow}} wild in Greater Manchester. Common heather (Calluna vulgaris) dominates the uplands, such as Saddleworth Moor, which lies within the South Pennines and Dark Peak {{area of the}} Peak District National Park. The Rochdale Canal {{harbours}} floating water-plantain (Luronium), an endangered aquatic plant. In 2002, Plantlife International launched its County Flowers campaign, asking {{members of the public}} to nominate and vote for a wild flower emblem for their county. Common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), a plant with fluffy white plumes native to wet hollows on high moors, was announced as the county flower of Greater Manchester. The house sparrow, common starling, and common blackbird are among the most populous bird species in Greater Manchester; Eurasian magpie and feral pigeon are common and breed in habitats across the county. The South Pennines support internationally important numbers of European golden plover, curlew, merlin and twite.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1982, George Steinbrenner, the Yankees owner, stated that <b>Nettles</b> [...] "is in the {{twilight}} of his career, and if he never plays another game for me, he has earned more than what I have paid him." [...] This comment insulted <b>Nettles,</b> and led to his increased dissatisfaction with the Yankees. The Yankees acquired Toby Harrah in February 1984, intending to platoon him with <b>Nettles</b> at third base. Dissatisfied with the platoon, <b>Nettles</b> reported to spring training at the deadline for his arrival. On March 30, 1984, the Yankees traded <b>Nettles</b> to the San Diego Padres for Dennis Rasmussen and a PTBNL. <b>Nettles</b> had wanted to play closer to his San Diego home, and his approval of the trade was required given his years of service.|$|R
