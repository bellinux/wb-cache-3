25|$|Humans {{were not}} the only ones that needed {{protection}} from gas clouds. Horses and mules were important methods of transportation that could be endangered if they came into close contact with gas. This was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a problem until it became common to launch gas great distances. This caused many researchers to develop masks that could be used on animals such as dogs, horses, mules, and even carrier pigeons.|$|E

The Darjeeling War Memorial is among the most visited places from which Kangchenjunga is observed. On a clear day it {{presents}} an image <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a mountain but of a white wall hanging from the sky. The people of Sikkim revere Kangchenjunga as a sacred mountain. Permission to climb the mountain from the Indian side is rarely given.|$|E

25|$|An {{essential}} {{question of}} practical reason for Hume was {{whether or not}} standards or principles exist (and if they do, what they are) for practical reason, that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people’s intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton, and Elijah Millgram claim that Hume is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an anti-rationalist as he is just a skeptic of practical reason.|$|E
25|$|For {{years the}} Touraine region would {{compete with the}} Beaujolais region {{for the release of}} an early {{bottling}} of Gamay that would rival the Beaujolais nouveau. While the competition is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a focal point now, there are still some producers who release early bottlings of the wine around the same time as Beaujolais. The soil around the Touraine area is a variety of limestone with excellent drainage that is known as tuffeau which is the same material used to build many of the famous Loire Valley Châteaux.|$|E
25|$|The {{external}} deficit was driven up primarily by {{high rates of}} growth of domestic demand and production through 1974. But in addition, the government's policy of holding to a fixed nominal exchange rate, in an increasingly inflationary context, allowed the real exchange rate to fall steadily from 1969 to 1975. The government refused to consider devaluation for fear it would worsen inflation and managed to avoid it by borrowing abroad to finance the continuing deficit. By 1975 external creditors had lost confidence in Peru's ability to repay its debts and began {{to put on the}} brakes. Whether because of such external pressure or because of growing internal opposition to the increasingly arbitrary decisions of the government, the Peruvian military decided to replace Velasco in 1975. The experiment ended on a note of defeat, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> its objectives as of its methods.|$|E

25|$|England {{obviously}} {{needed to}} do something to maintain their hold on the Ashes and three changes were made to the team. The first was forced as Godfrey Evans had broken his middle finger and the reserve wicket-keeper Roy Swetman made his Test debut. This was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a loss as first thought, Evans had not batted well for some years and Swetman had impressed behind the stumps throughout the tour and his batting had improved beyond all hopes. Peter Richardson had failed repeatedly as an opening batsman in the Tests and was replaced by his old opening partner Arthur Milton, even though he had broken his finger at Christmas. Willie Watson was dropped in favour of the newly arrived Cambridge and Sussex batsman Ted Dexter, who was also a more than useful swing bowler. May also had his final trump card, the fast bowler Fred Trueman, who had been ill at Brisbane and left out at Melbourne. He is widely considered to be England's greatest fast bowler and with good reason; he was the first man to take 300 wickets in Tests—307 at (21.57)—had tremendous stamina and bowled with a near perfect side on action that produced late swing at high pace. He was full of confidence and believed that he could get any batsman out on any wicket. Australia made changes as well, dropping Lindsay Kline who had taken 0/77 in two Tests and Bobby Simpson who had made a duck but was retained as twelfth man for his fielding. Instead they brought in the dual purpose fast-medium seamer and off-spinner Keith Slater, who had been twelfth man in the Second Test, but who had been accused of throwing by the MCC and Keith Miller. Mel McInnes kept his place as umpire even though Peter May and Freddie Brown had pointedly asked if it was necessary for him to officiate in all the Tests.|$|E
500|$|Prospective {{recruits}} had {{to undergo}} an examination. Recruits {{had to be}} 20–25 years of age, a range that was extended to 19–35 in the later 4th century. Recruits had to be physically fit and meet the traditional minimum height requirement of 6 Roman feet (5ft 10in, 175cm) until 367, when it was reduced to 5 Roman feet and 3 Roman palms (5ft 7in, 167cm). Vegetius hints that in the very late Empire (ca. AD 400) even this [...] height requirement may have been relaxed, for [...] "... if necessity demands, it is right to take account <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> stature as of strength. Even Homer himself is not wanting as a witness, since he records that Tydeus was small in body but a strong warrior".|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{thought he}} {{lost touch with}} American values while living in Paris, but his biographer Michael Reynolds claims the opposite, seeing {{evidence}} of the author's midwestern American values in the novel. [...] Hemingway admired hard work. He portrayed the matadors and the prostitutes, who work for a living, in a positive manner, but Brett, who prostitutes herself, is emblematic of [...] "the rotten crowd" [...] living on inherited money. It is Jake, the working journalist, who pays the bills again and again when those who can pay do not. Hemingway shows, through Jake's actions, his disapproval {{of the people who}} did not pay up. [...] Reynolds says that Hemingway shows the tragedy, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the decadence of the Montparnasse crowd, but of the decline in American values of the period. As such, the author created an American hero who is impotent and powerless. Jake becomes the moral center of the story. He never considers himself part of the expatriate crowd because he is a working man; to Jake a working man is genuine and authentic, {{and those who do not}} work for a living spend their lives posing.|$|E

500|$|The novel's format, {{its various}} {{multiple}} sources, its manipulation of linear time and its inclusion of supernatural elements (talking dogs and meteor rifles, for example) all serve to deconstruct {{the idea of}} absolute power, by creating an ambiguity between fact and myth, between Dr Francia and the Supreme, and between Roa Bastos and the Compiler. Francia places himself above all power and history: [...] "I don't write history. I make it. I can remake it as I please, adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth." [...] Yet in the Compiler's notes and retelling of events, the novel {{is presented as a}} genuine version of history, one that contradicts and questions the Supreme's. In their collectivity, they deny the illusion of absolute power, whether the power is that of Francia the dictator or Roa Bastos the writer. This ambiguity between myth and fact is elaborated on {{at the end of the}} novel in the fictional debate over the Supreme's remains; it questions the nature of national political myth, and how heroes and villains are created in it and where the Supreme falls into those categories after being portrayed as both by Roa Bastos. As Deiner poses the question raised by the novel, [...] "Is he to be portrayed as a valiant leader who held the country together in the face of enormous external aggression, or as a despot who laid the basis for almost two centuries of exploitation of Paraguay’s peoples by its leaders?" [...] The answer is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> importance to the novel, so much as the fact that the question itself exists, thereby confirming the power of writing over so called [...] "absolute" [...] power.|$|E

2500|$|A {{mistress}} {{is not a}} prostitute: while a mistress, if [...] "kept", may, in some sense, be exchanging sex for money, {{the principal}} difference is that a mistress has sex with fewer men and there is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a direct quid pro quo between {{the money and the}} sex act. There is usually an emotional and possibly social relationship between a man and his mistress, whereas the relationship to a prostitute is predominantly sexual. It is also important that the [...] "kept" [...] status follows the establishment of a relationship of indefinite term as opposed to the agreement on price and terms established prior to any activity with a prostitute.|$|E

2500|$|Latitude is the {{principal}} influence on Finland's climate. Because of Finland's northern location, winter is the longest season. Only in the south coast is summer as long as winter. On the average, winter lasts from early December to mid March in the archipelago and the southwestern coast and from early October to early May in Lapland. This means that southern portions {{of the country are}} snow-covered about three to four months of the year and the northern, about seven months. The long winter causes about half of the annual [...] of precipitation in the north to fall as snow. Precipitation in the south amounts to about [...] annually. Like that of the north, it occurs all through the year, though <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> it is snow.|$|E
