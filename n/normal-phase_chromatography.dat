25|$|<b>Normal–phase</b> <b>chromatography</b> {{was one of}} {{the first}} kinds of HPLC that chemists developed. Also known as normal-phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) this method {{separates}} analytes based on their affinity for a polar stationary surface such as silica, hence it is based on analyte ability to engage in polar interactions (such as hydrogen-bonding or dipole-dipole type of interactions) with the sorbent surface. NP-HPLC uses a non-polar, non-aqueous mobile phase (e.g. Chloroform), and works effectively for separating analytes readily soluble in non-polar solvents. The analyte associates with and is retained by the polar stationary phase. Adsorption strengths increase with increased analyte polarity. The interaction strength depends not only on the functional groups present in the structure of the analyte molecule, but also on steric factors. The effect of steric hindrance on interaction strength allows this method to resolve (separate) structural isomers.|$|E
25|$|Common {{mobile phases}} used include any {{miscible}} combination {{of water with}} various organic solvents (the most common are acetonitrile and methanol). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see <b>Normal-phase</b> <b>chromatography</b> below). The aqueous component of the mobile phase may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid) or salts {{to assist in the}} separation of the sample components. The composition of the mobile phase may be kept constant ("isocratic elution mode") or varied ("gradient elution mode") during the chromatographic analysis. Isocratic elution is typically effective in the separation of sample components that are very different in their affinity for the stationary phase. In gradient elution the composition of the mobile phase is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the mobile phase is reflected by analyte retention times with high eluting strength producing fast elution (=short retention times). A typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% acetonitrile (in water or aqueous buffer) and progress linearly to 95% acetonitrile over 5–25 minutes. Periods of constant mobile phase composition may be part of any gradient profile. For example, the mobile phase composition may be kept constant at 5% acetonitrile for 1–3 min, followed by a linear change up to 95% acetonitrile.|$|E

The elution order of nonglycopeptides relative to glycopeptides in IP-NPLC is predictable by their hydrophobicity values calculated using the Wimley-White water/octanol hydrophobicity scale. Olinked glycopeptides can be efficiently isolated from fetuin tryptic digests using IP-NPLC when N-glycans are first removed with PNGase. IP-NPLC recovers close to 100 % of bacterial N-linked glycopeptides modified with non-sialylated heptasaccharides from tryptic digests of periplasmic protein extracts from Campylobacter jejuni 11168 and its pglD mutant. Label-free nano-flow reversed- phase LC-MS is used for quantification of differentially expressed glycopeptides from the C. jejuni wildtype and pglD mutant followed by identification of these glycoproteins using multiple stage tandem MS.

In this context, <b>normal-phase</b> <b>chromatography</b> allows separation of polyphenols based on their degree of polymerization.

However, from the single proanthocyanidins identified, nonameric and decameric proanthocyanidins were found to have the highest values for the antioxidant capacity. The degree of polymerization associated with each molecular weight fraction was further confirmed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry coupled with reverse-phase liquid chromatography.

Glycans were analyzed by <b>normal-phase</b> high-performance liquid <b>chromatography</b> and by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization– mass spectrometry...|$|R

Two medium polar fractions showing high genotoxic activity in the Ames test were further subfractionated, using <b>normal-phase</b> high-performance liquid <b>chromatography.</b> Chemical analyses were performed by means of gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry and flame ionization and detection. The crude extracts, fractions, and subfractions were assayed with the Ames test, with and without S 9, and the most abundant compounds in the subfractions are reported. - Environ Health Perspect 1 02 (Suppl 4) : 85 - 92 (1994) ...|$|R
