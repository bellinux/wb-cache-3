40|$|<b>Nutrition</b> <b>surveillance</b> is {{a rather}} recent {{application}} of epidemiological surveillance to nutrition. It covers not only the morbidity and mortality of nutritional disorders, but {{is at least as}} much interested in their major determinants. After some fifteen years of trial and error, <b>nutrition</b> <b>surveillance</b> has today found its way: its concepts, methods and uses are well established by now. After retrieving experiences conducted since the seventies and the eighties, and {{on the basis of their}} own experience, the authors have come to identify a few major features of nutrition surveillance: predominance of the supply of information over the collection of data; the early identification of users; the importance of causal analysis as a departure point for conceiving a surveillance activity; the highly selective choice of data to be collected; a permanent concern for sustainability; the participation of all actors (or "stakeholders") and, from a technical viewpoint, the place of qualitative data collection techniques (borrowed from social anthropology) to complement quantitative data.

40|$|An {{adequate}} and varied diet {{is important for}} normal growth and development, maintenance of good health and the prevention of chronic disease; as {{is the need for}} up-to-date, reliable and timely data to provide a basis for informed decision making and regulation by government. Despite this, and clear evidence for the contribution of nutrition to the considerable burden of preventable ill health, Australia’s policy makers do not have adequate information to develop cost-effective food and nutrition policy and regulation. The need for a national food and <b>nutrition</b> monitoring and <b>surveillance</b> system has long been recognised and it has been identified as a priority in several public health nutrition, obesity, physical activity and chronic disease-related policy documents. This report provides a framework and cost estimates for establishing a national food and <b>nutrition</b> monitoring <b>surveillance</b> system (FNMS). The development of the framework follows extensive consultation with a diverse range of stakeholders: Australian, State and Territory Governments, non-government organisations, professional associations and industry bodies. The framework was also informed by a review of selected international approaches to food and nutrition monitoring. Overwhelming support for an ongoing, sustainable FNMS emerged from these consultations. Government agencies, policy makers, regulators and industry representatives state {{that they do not have}} adequate information on the following: • the nutritional adequacy of the food supply; • equity of food access; • effects on health of changes in the composition of foods in the food supply; • use of nutritional supplements and their effect on nutrient intake, nutritional status and health; final report: national food and <b>nutrition</b> monitoring and <b>surveillance</b> system April 2006 5 www. nexusmc. com. au • differences in nutritional status between different population sub-groups; • alignment of food and nutrient intakes in the population with dietary targets and guidelines and nutrient reference values developed for Australia and New Zealand; • trends in eating patterns and their effect on food industry growth and innovation; • implications of technological and regulatory changes on the composition of the food supply; and • risks associated with exposure to bioactive compounds in foods at current levels of consumption. The consultation process also identified a range of significant costs and risks associated with not having an ongoing system, including: • reduced ability to appropriately develop, target and monitor the outcomes of public health nutrition interventions; • late detection of new, or accelerating, nutrition problems in the community, and the lack of trend information about the possible causes; • increasing reliance on outdated data to undertake effective risk assessment for food additives, fortification with vitamins and minerals, chemical residues etc; and • an inability to monitor the objectives of public health nutrition policies and programs. For the majority of stakeholders the costs and risks of not having a system far outweighed the costs of establishing an ongoing monitoring system.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} county-level socioeconomic environment and the propensity to be overweight or obese by race/ethnic group {{in a sample of}} fourth grade children the Texas public school system. Methods: The data used come from the School Physical Activity and <b>Nutrition</b> (SPAN) <b>surveillance</b> study – a surveillance study of school-aged children in Texas. The outcome variable used was Body Mass Index (BMI) categorized as underweight/normal/healthy, overweight, and obese. Exposure variables were derived from county-level Hispanic and Black concentration and socioeconomic data using the Human Security Index (HSI) as a framework. We made comparisons between Non-Hispanic White, Black and Hispanic children enrolled in the fourth grade. We used bivariate and regression analysis using jackknife variance estimates. Results: Hispanic and Black children {{were more likely to be}} obese and overweight than non-Hispanic White children. Hispanic and Black children were more likely to live in counties with higher economic, educational and social stress than non-Hispanic White children. In the logistic regression analysis comparing the odds of overweight or obese to underweight/healthy/normal weight, both Hispanic and Black children continued to have a higher odds of overweight and obesity than non-Hispanic White children. In separate regression analyses for each race/ethnic group (ie, Hispanic, Black, and White students) the county-level educational and social stress variables had a significant association with overweight and obesity in Hispanic children only. Hispanic ethnic concentration was associated with the odds of being overweight but not obese, while percent Black was associated with obesity in Hispanic children. There were no significant associations between socioeconomic or ethnic concentration and overweight or obese in Black children. Discussion: The results from this study indicate that county-level effects on childhood obesity may be more than just socioeconomics and ethnic concentration. Future research should involve multiple levels of analysis, including census tract, school and home variables simultaneously, in order to understand how the environments children live in impact their risk for obesity and how these influences may vary by race/ethnicity...|$|R
40|$|Child {{malnutrition}} (includes both under- and overweight) {{remains a}} challenge. Routine growth monitoring {{is a common}} practice that aims to: detect children at risk of malnutrition; direct essential resources when children have growth faltering; track nutrition trends; determine eligibility for counselling and other specific services; and help to make child malnutrition more visible to the child’s caregivers, the community and government. The quality and usefulness of growth monitoring is often limited by poor data quality, long delays between data collection and dissemination that prevent timely response, and shortcomings in the interpretation {{and use of the}} data. The full potential of growth monitoring is often underused both to increase knowledge and improve practices at community level and to inform decision-making for better nutrition. The use of mobile phone technology may offer innovative opportunities to strengthen community-based growth monitoring and make it more effective for tackling child malnutrition.

40|$|Breastfeeding {{initiation}} {{and duration}} trend data {{is an important}} component of infant health and <b>nutrition</b> monitoring and <b>surveillance</b> systems. It is also an important basis for identifying breastfeeding promotion needs, prioritising target groups and strategies and in evaluating the effectiveness of breastfeeding promotion efforts. A collation and analysis of available Tasmanian breastfeeding initiation data was undertaken in order to help direct statewide breastfeeding promotion planning and evaluation and to begin the development of a minimum data set for statewide breastfeeding monitoring and surveillance. Perinatally collected breastfeeding initiation data (breastfeeding at discharge from hospital) was analysed against available demographic and socioeconomic variables and compared with initiation rates from interstate Australian populations. Data suggest that breastfeeding initiation rates in Tasmania have been static over the 15 years to 1995 (a three percent increase from 1981 to 1995) and that the associations between breastfeeding initiation and occupational classification, maternal age and parity in Tasmania are consistent with those reported elsewere. Whilst caution needs to be applied to between- population comparisons, breastfeeding initiation rates in Tasmania appear to be considerably lower than that reported in other states. This suggests relatively greater efforts are required to influence breastfeeding initiation. Further research is required to investigate reasons for this difference. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|The Pediatric <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Surveillance</b> System (PedNSS) is {{a public}} health {{surveillance}} system that monitors the nutritional status of low-income children in federally funded {{maternal and child health}} programs. Data on birthweight, breastfeeding, anemia, short stature, underweight, overweight, and obesity are collected for children who attend public health clinics for routine care, nutrition education, and supplemental food. Data are collected at the clinic level then aggregated at the state level and submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for analysis. A national <b>nutrition</b> <b>surveillance</b> report is produced by using PedNSS data. Surveillance reports also are produced for each contributor (defined as a state, U. S. territory, or Indian Tribal Organization [ITO]). In 2007, a total of 51 contributors, including 44 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 5 tribal governments, participated in PedNSS (Figure 1) and submitted records for nearly 8 million children from birth to 5 years of age. Data for the 2007 PedNSS were collected from children enrolled in federally funded programs that serve low-income children, including the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) (85 %) and non-WIC programs (15 %) that include the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) Program, the Title V Maternal and Child Health Program, and other federally funded programs. The goal of PedNSS is to collect, analyze, and disseminate surveillance data to guide public health policy and action.

Lifestyle behaviours such as physical activity and dietary intake have been largely associated with obesity in many countries; however studies that combine nutrition and physical activity assessment in representative samples of Latin American countries are lacking. The aim {{of this study is to}} present the design rationale of the Latin American Study of Nutrition and Health/Estudio Latinoamericano de Nutrición y Salud (ELANS) with a particular focus on its quality control procedures and recruitment processes. Methods/Design The ELANS is a multicenter cross-sectional <b>nutrition</b> and health <b>surveillance</b> study of a nationally representative sample of urban populations from eight Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Perú and Venezuela). A standard study protocol was designed to evaluate the nutritional intakes, physical activity levels, and anthropometric measurements of 9000 enrolled participants. The study was based on a complex, multistage sample design and the sample was stratified by gender, age (15 to 65  years old) and socioeconomic level. A small-scale pilot study was performed in each country to test the procedures and tools.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} the late onset sepsis (LOS) rate of our service, characterize the intestinal microbiota and evaluate a possible association between gut flora and sepsis in surgical infants who were receiving parenteral <b>nutrition</b> (PN). METHODS: <b>Surveillance</b> cultures of the gut were taken at the start of PN and thereafter once a week. Specimens for blood culture were collected based on clinical criteria established by the medical staff. The central venous catheter (CVC) tip was removed under aseptic conditions. Standard laboratory methods were used to identify the microorganisms that grew on cultures of gut, blood and CVC tip. RESULTS: 74 very low birth weight infants were analyzed. All the infants were receiving PN and antibiotics when the gut culture was started. In total, 21 (28. 4 %) infants experienced 28 episodes of LOS with no identified source. Coagulase negative staphylococci were the most common bacteria identified, both in the intestine (74. 2 %) and blood (67. 8 %). All infections occurred in patients who received PN through a central venous catheter. Six infants experienced episodes of microbial translocation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, LOS was the most frequent episode in neonates receiving parenteral nutrition who had been submitted to surgery; 28. 6 % of this infection was probably a gut-derived phenomenon and requires novel strategies for prevention...|$|R

40|$|Extracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) {{for severe}} acute respiratory failure was proposed more than 40 years ago. Despite {{the publication of}} the ARDSNet study and adoption of lung protective ventilation, the mortality for acute respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome has continued to remain high. This technology has evolved {{over the past couple of}} decades and has been noted to be safe and successful, especially during the worldwide H 1 N 1 influenza pandemic with good survival rates. The primary indications for ECMO in acute respiratory failure include severe refractory hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure in spite of maximum lung protective ventilatory support. Various triage criteria have been described and published. Contraindications exist when application of ECMO may be futile or technically impossible. Knowledge and appreciation of the circuit, cannulae, and the physiology of gas exchange with ECMO are necessary to ensure lung rest, efficiency of oxygenation, and ventilation as well as troubleshooting problems. Anticoagulation is a major concern with ECMO, and the evidence is evolving with respect to diagnostic testing and use of anticoagulants. Clinical management of the patient includes comprehensive critical care addressing sedation and neurologic issues, ensuring lung recruitment, diuresis, early enteral <b>nutrition,</b> treatment and <b>surveillance</b> of infections, and multisystem organ support. Newer technology that delinks oxygenation and ventilation by extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal may lead to ultra-lung protective ventilation, avoidance of endotracheal intubation in some situations, and ambulatory therapies as a bridge to lung transplantation.
