40|$|Avoiding {{cannibalization}} of {{an existing}} store’s sales {{as a result of}} opening a <b>new</b> <b>store</b> is a perennial challenge facing a firm’s store expansion policies. The research question is to identify the statistical techniques {{that can be used to}} determine whether or not a <b>new</b> <b>store</b> cannibalizes the sales {{of an existing}} store. Using OLS regression techniques, the initial conclusion is that <b>new</b> <b>store</b> sales have a positive effect on existing store sales. Examination of a plot of the residuals suggests the OLS model is insufficient, and the presence of autocorrelation leads the analyst to conclude that the OLS model is invalid. The application of time series techniques concludes (1) that <b>new</b> <b>store</b> sales do not affect existing store sales, (2) that a strong weekly effect is correctly modeled by the inclusion of seasonal pulses for Saturday and Sunday effects, and (3) that the inclusion of nine pulse variables accounts for the effects of the previously identified outliers. These conclusions offer convincing insights into a firm’s store expansion policies.
