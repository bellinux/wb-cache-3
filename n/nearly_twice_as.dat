50|$|De Havilland's design, the DHC-5 Buffalo, {{was chosen}} as the winner of the United States Army {{competition}} in early 1963, with four DHC-5s, designated YAC-2 (later CV-7A and subsequently C-8A) ordered. The first of these aircraft made its maiden flight on 9 April 1964. All four aircraft were delivered in 1965, the Buffalo carrying <b>nearly</b> <b>twice</b> the payload <b>as</b> the Caribou while having better STOL performance. The prototype CV-7A was exhibited by the manufacturer at the 1965 Paris Air Show wearing US Army markings. No further US orders followed, however, as at the start of 1967 (See the Johnson-McConnell agreement of 1966), inter-service politics led to large fixed-wing transports being transferred to the United States Air Force, who considered themselves adequately equipped with the Fairchild Aircraft C-123 Provider.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the events}} of the DC maxi-series comic Crisis on Infinite Earths, which massively retconned DC Universe history and continuity, Poison Ivy's origins were revised in Secret Origins #36, 1988, written by Neil Gaiman. Poison Ivy's real name is Dr. Pamela Lillian Isley, PhD, a Gotham City botanist. She grows up wealthy with emotionally distant parents and later studies {{advanced}} botanical biochemistry at a university with Alec Holland under Dr. Jason Woodrue. Isley, a timid shy girl, is easily seduced by her professor. Woodrue injects Isley with poisons and toxins as an experiment, causing her transformation. She <b>nearly</b> dies <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> a result of these poisonings, driving her insane. Later, Woodrue flees from the authorities leaving Isley in the hospital for six months. Enraged at the betrayal, she suffers from violent mood swings, being sweet one moment and evil the next. When her boyfriend has a car accident after mysteriously suffering from a massive fungal overgrowth, Isley drops out of school and leaves Seattle, eventually settling in Gotham City.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 32) The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine whether there existed covariant characteristics among students labeled by their teachers as unteachable. Findings in the literature indicate a wide disparity as to the causes of a student's inability to learn within the classroom. An inner-city high school population was used. After obtaining the names of subjects from the teachers, these subjects were compared to each other through the use of cumulative records. Data revealed the dominance of male tenth graders with below average IQ and reading scores. The subject's family was typical of an average American family except for the breadwinner's relatively low job status. The subject's referral to this study came predominantly from periods closely related to the school's nutritional program. Though the teacher ethnic balance at the school was <b>nearly</b> equal, <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> many black teachers did not participate in this study as did the white teachers. It was concluded that common characteristics among students designated as unteachable were consistent, but were not ones usually associated with an unteachable student. Low family transiency, average size families, and not a typically middle child were noted. Complete and accurate cumulative record keeping was strongly urged...|$|R
40|$|Warming Arctic {{temperatures}} {{could lead}} to the release of significant methane emissions from thawing permafrost and marine deposits. Sub-regional scale decreases in reflectivity result from loss of snow cover and advancing shrub and tree lines and lead to more warming, permafrost thaw, and methane release. Feedbacks from sub-regional processes produce more methane emissions that then feed into global scale warming trends. These new findings bring an added sense of urgency to advance climate and energy policy decisions. ARCTIC CLIMATE FEEDBACKS The Arctic, a key component of the global climate system, is warming at <b>nearly</b> <b>twice</b> the rate <b>as</b> the rest of the world. This warming trend, which is already affecting arctic ecosystems and the people who depend upon them, has been closely monitored over recent decades and is projected to continue throughout the 21 st century (ACIA 2004, ACIA 2005).

5|$|A port of {{the game}} for the PlayStation 3 was {{announced}} in April 2009. The port features full voice acting, containing <b>nearly</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> much voice work as the original voice script, which covers previously unvoiced cutscenes in the 360 version. The game also features various new characters, has Flynn as a permanent playable character, and adds a new playable character {{in the form of}} Patty Fleur. Development on the port began in 2008, after the release of the original version. Speaking on why the port was being developed, a developer who worked on Vampire Rain said that companies like Namco Bandai first developed for the Xbox 360 due to superior funding and development support when compared to Sony, then ported to PS3 with minimal effort so they could recoup development costs and add features that needed to be cut from the original game.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are <b>nearly</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Stabæk {{announced}} they had signed an eleven-year sponsorship {{agreement with the}} telecommunications company Telenor, where the latter would pay up to NOK115 million for the sole naming rights for the arena, in addition to tickets and access to executive boxes. In March 2009, the retailing property was sold from Scandinavian Property Development to KLP Eiendom. The plans called for twenty to twenty-five football games, four to eight concerts, three to four large sports events and two other large events and conventions per year. Because of larger seating capacity, an all-seating arrangement, higher attendance and VIP facilities, Stabæk is able to generate three times the matchday revenue from Telenor Arena as Nadderud. The stadium is plagued with traffic problems on matchdays, with large crews hired to create temporary barriers to direct the crowds. The bus stops closest to the venue are closed, {{and a large number}} of police officers have to direct the traffic. These are costs which have to be carried by the arena company, and contrasts to matches at the <b>nearly</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> large Ullevaal, where no such measures are necessary.|$|E
30|$|Conclusions Patients {{receiving}} RRT had a {{mortality rate}} on ultimate hospital discharge of 52.6 %, roughly {{in line with}} previous studies, and <b>nearly</b> <b>twice</b> the rate in those not requiring RRT.

5|$|The {{skull of}} the dodo {{differed}} much {{from those of}} other pigeons, especially in being more robust, the bill having a hooked tip, and in having a short cranium compared to the jaws. The upper bill was <b>nearly</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> long as the cranium, which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives. The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated {{along the length of}} the beak, and they contained no bony septum. The cranium (excluding the beak) was wider than it was long, and the frontal bone formed a dome-shape, with the highest point above the hind part of the eye sockets. The skull sloped downwards at the back. The eye sockets occupied much of the hind part of the skull. The sclerotic rings inside the eye were formed by eleven ossicles (small bones), similar to the amount in other pigeons. The mandible was slightly curved, and each half had a single fenestra (opening), as in other pigeons.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, TiAl-based {{intermetallic}} alloys {{are being}} increasingly considered for application {{in areas such}} as (i) automobile/transport sector (passenger cars, trucks and ships) (ii) aerospace industry (jet engines and High Speed Civil Transport propulsion system) and (iii) industrial gas turbines. These materials offer excellent (i) high temperature properties (at higher than 6000 C) (ii) mechanical strength and (iii) resistance to corrosion and as a result have raised renewed interest. The combination of these properties make them possible replacement materials for traditional nickel-based super-alloys, which are <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> dense (than TiAl based alloys). Since the microstructures of these intermetallic alloys affect, to a significant extent, their ultimate performance, further improvements (by way of alteration/modification of these microstructures), have been the subject matter of intense research investigations. It has now been established that the presence of alloy additives, such as niobium, tantalum, manganese, boron, chromium, silicon, nickel and yttrium etc, in specific quantities, impart marked improvement to the properties, viz. fatigue strength, fracture toughness, oxidation resistance and room temperature ductility, of these alloys. From a number of possible alloy compositions, {gamma}-TiAl and Ti-Al-Nb-Cr have, of late, emerged as two promising engineering alloys/materials.. The conventional fabrication process of these alloys include steps such as melting, forging and heat treatment/annealing of the alloy compositions. However, an electrochemical process offers an attractive proposition to prepare these alloys, directly from the mixture of the respective oxides, in just one step. The experimental approach, in this new process, was, therefore, to try to electrochemically reduce the (mixed) oxide pellet to an alloy phase. The removal of oxygen, from the (mixed) oxide pellet, was effected by polarizing the oxide pellet against a graphite electrode in a pool of molten calcium chloride at a temperature of 9000 C. The dominant mechanism of the oxygen removal was the ionization of oxygen followed by its subsequent discharge, as CO 2 /CO, at the anode surface. The removal of oxygen from the oxide mixture helped form the alloy in situ.
