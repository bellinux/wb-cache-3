40|$|AbstractObjectivesEndovascular {{aneurysm}} repair (EVAR) is {{an established}} method of aortic aneurysm repair, in favourable anatomical configurations. It does however expose patients to radiation. The study {{aim was to}} determine if the aneurysm neck morphology influenced radiation exposure. Patients and methodsAll elective and emergency EVAR patients were identified. Elective patients had a bifurcated stent-graft deployed, while emergency patients were repaired with an aorto-uni-iliac stent-graft and fem–fem crossover bypass. Proximal and distal aortic <b>neck</b> <b>diameters,</b> <b>neck</b> length, neck angles and sac diameter were recorded, with the radiation dose, screening time and contrast volume. The two subgroups of elective and emergency patients were compared and correlation between anatomical and radiological parameters calculated by using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results 320 (270 male) elective patients and 64 (55 male) emergency patients from October 1998 to October 2008 underwent EVAR. The mean proximal (p =  0. 004) and distal (p =  0. 01) <b>neck</b> <b>diameters</b> were smaller and mean sac diameter (p <  0. 0001) was greater in emergencies. No difference between groups existed in the neck length (p =  0. 36) and suprarenal diameter (p =  0. 30), sagittal (p =  0. 05) and coronal (p =  0. 62) neck angles. The screening time (p =  0. 053) and contrast volume (p =  0. 04) were lower, with a slightly higher radiation dose (p =  0. 12) in emergencies. There was no definite correlation between the seven anatomical and three radiological parameters. ConclusionWhile radiation exposure is different in emergency patients, this is thought due to surgical technique rather than the aneurysm neck morphology...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{experimental}} induction of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) in sheep is established. To tap {{the full}} potential of this ovine model, {{one should be}} able to perform a femoral osteochondroplasty safely. This study was based on previous cadaver experiments on the blood supply to the ovine femoral head and on the biomechanical strength of the proximal femur following offset creation. We hypothesized that offset creation in this ovine FAI model does not lead to (1) avascular necrosis (AVN) of the ovine femoral head or (2) iatrogenic femoral neck fractures and (3) can be performed effectively. DESIGN: In this experimental, controlled, prospective study nine sheep underwent unilateral FAI induction through an intertrochanteric, varus osteotomy. Seventy days following FAI induction, femoral osteochondroplasty was performed. Sheep were sacrificed after another 140 days. Radiographs, computed tomography (CT) scans and MRI were acquired. Histologic samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. (1) The multimodal Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) classification was used for assessment of AVN. (2) Femoral neck fractures were assessed with the multimodal imaging approach. (3) Pre- and postoperative (=after sacrifice) alpha angles and femoral <b>neck</b> <b>diameters</b> were compared. RESULTS: (1) No signs for AVN according to the ARCO classification or (2) for femoral neck fractures were detected. (3) Mean alpha angles and femoral <b>neck</b> <b>diameters</b> decreased superiorly by at least 30 ° respectively 4  mm after the offset creation. CONCLUSIONS: Femoral osteochondroplasty can be performed effectively and without the risk of AVN or femoral neck fractures in ovine FAI...|$|R

An explicit dropping condition has been deduced. It formulates relations among characteristic dimensions of the dispensing system, surface tension and density of the liquid.

The viability of using X-ray microtomography (μCT) to quantify and track changes in morphology of SLM Ti porous structures at each stage of the post-laser melting production was tested, quantifying its quality through process.

We have studied the growth and disappearance mechanisms of laterally microscopic liquid bridges of three hydrocarbon liquids in slit-like pores. At rapid slit-opening rates, the bridges rupture {{by means of a}} mechanical instability described by the Young–Laplace equation. Noncontinuum but apparently reversible behavior is observed when a bridge is held at nanoscopic surface separations H close to the thermodynamic equilibrium Kelvin length, 2 rKcosθ, where rK is the Kelvin radius and θ is the contact angle. During the course of slow evaporation (at H > 2 rKcosθ) and subsequent regrowth by capillary condensation (at H < 2 rKcosθ), the refractive index of the bridge may vary continuously and reversibly between that of the bulk liquid and vapor. The evaporation process becomes irreversible only at the very final stage of evaporation, when the refractive index of the fluid attains virtually that of the vapor. Measured refractive index profiles and the time-dependence of evaporating <b>neck</b> <b>diameters</b> also seem to differ from predictions based on a continuum picture of bridge evaporation far from the critical point. We discuss these findings in terms of the probable density profiles in evolving liquid bridges...|$|R
40|$|Hip spacers are {{temporary}} implants {{having a}} geometry {{similar to the}} femoral component of a hip prosthesis, and they are manufactured with antibiotic-impregnated bone cement. The use of spacers in two stage revisions {{is the most effective}} treatment to eradicate infections and to avoid limb shortening. The most frequent complication associated with spacers is fatigue failure, for which doctors recommend patients to stay at rest. In this work, several spacer designs are analyzed {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of doing activities like walking, standing up or sitting down while performing the antibiotics treatment. Designs combine both different <b>neck</b> <b>diameters</b> and the presence/absence of an internal, stainless steel reinforcement. By means of computational simulations based on the finite element method, stress fields are calculated for various hip spacer designs under several load and fixing conditions. For this purpose, a 3 D model of human femur is generated by processing tomographic images with segmentation techniques and inverse engineering. The results allow us to estimate the life expectancy of each design, by considering the fatigue behavior of the bone cement. Only the introduction of a reinforcement with a proper diameter into the bone cement matrix could assure the integrity of the spacer along the treatment period. Fil: Weiss, Brenda Anahí.
