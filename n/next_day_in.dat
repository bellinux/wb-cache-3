5|$|A low {{pressure}} area moved to the west off the Burmese coast on July 5 and developed into a depression the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> the north central Bay of Bengal. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression on July 7. The system made landfall on the Orissa coast during the morning of July 8 and rapidly degenerated into a broad area of {{low pressure}} overland. The remnant low moved north over western Bihar and it persisted there until July 12 when it was absorbed by the monsoon trough.|$|E
5|$|A typhoon {{approached}} eastern Luzon on September 16, {{and moved}} across the island on the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> the municipality of Baler on the east coast, a minimum pressure of 969 mbar (28.63 inHg) was recorded. The typhoon's eye passed over and nearly destroyed the town. A tornado spawned by the typhoon hit Metro Manila. The typhoon progressed westward into the South China Sea, later curving to the northwest and entering the Gulf of Tonkin near the island of Hainan. After the storm, the Philippine government provided aid to residents.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} of growing {{steadily}} weaker and undergoing treatment from Dr Sim Ki Ay, {{on the evening of}} 17November 1948 Oerip collapsed and died from a heart attack in his room in Yogyakarta. After a night-long viewing he was buried the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> Semaki Heroes' Cemetery and posthumously promoted to general. When Sudirman threatened to resign in 1949, he blamed Oerip's death– as well as his own tuberculosis– on the government's inconsistency during the revolution. Oerip was survived by his wife and adopted daughter. Abby died of malaria in January 1951, and Rohmah died on 29October 1977 in Semarang; she was buried in Ungaran.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{international}} pressure on Croatia {{to end the}} siege of the JNA garrison in Zagreb, Croatian authorities and the JNA signed an agreement on 22 November to evacuate all remaining JNA forces from Croatia. The agreement was signed in Zagreb, by HV Colonel Imra Agotić and Lieutenant Colonel General Andrija Rašeta in presence of the ECMM monitors. The agreement was confirmed the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> Geneva when the Geneva Accord was signed by Tuđman, Milošević and the Yugoslav defence minister, JNA General Veljko Kadijević.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the fights}} between Troilus and Diomedes from the {{traditional}} narrative of Benoît and Guido take place the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> Shakespeare's retelling. Diomedes captures Troilus' horse in the first fight and sends it to Cressida. Then the Trojan triumphs in the second, though Diomedes escapes. But in a deviation from this narrative it is Hector, not Troilus, whom the Myrmidons surround in the climatic battle of the play and whose body is dragged behind Achilles' horse. Troilus himself is left alive vowing revenge for Hector's death and rejecting Pandarus. Troilus' story ends, as it began, in medias res with him and the remaining characters in his love-triangle remaining alive.|$|E

5|$|Carlsen {{obtained}} {{his second}} GM norm at the Moscow Aeroflot Open in February. On 17 March, in a blitz chess tournament in Reykjavík, Iceland, Carlsen defeated former World Champion Anatoly Karpov. The blitz tournament was a preliminary event {{leading up to}} a rapid knockout tournament beginning the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> that event, Carlsen was paired with Garry Kasparov, then the top-rated player in the world. Carlsen achieved a draw in their first game but lost the second, and was thus knocked out of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 1915 in Fauquissart, France, Rifleman Thapa, {{having been}} wounded himself, found a wounded soldier of The Leicestershire Regiment behind {{the first line}} German trench. Although urged to save himself, the Gurkha stayed with the wounded man all day and night. Early <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>in</b> misty weather, he took him through the German wire and, leaving him {{in a place of}} {{comparative}} safety, returned and brought in two wounded Gurkhas, one after the other. He then went back, and, in broad daylight, fetched the British soldier, carrying him most of the way under enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|Punk made {{a special}} {{appearance}} at the ROH show Unscripted II on February 11, 2006, when the original card had to be scrapped due to Low Ki leaving ROH the week prior. In addition, most of the ROH roster contracted to TNA were pulled from the show because of a snowstorm that TNA officials thought might prevent performers from reaching a pay-per-view scheduled the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> the main event, Punk teamed with Bryan Danielson to defeat Jimmy Rave and Adam Pearce in a tag team match.|$|E

5|$|Péraud's {{position}} {{held steady}} {{for the next}} three days, in stages won by sprinters and breakaways. In stage 18, which finished at the Col du Galibier, Péraud finished a modest 16th, but this result moved him into the top ten overall. He dropped back out of the top ten the next day on Alpe d'Huez by finishing 12th and sufficiently behind Pierre Rolland that the younger Frenchman took his place, but regained tenth overall the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> Grenoble thanks to his super time trial skills. He held tenth the next day to finish as the team's best-placed rider. Roche's final position was 26th.|$|E
5|$|The Red Star Line changed Kroonland from American to Belgian {{registry}} on 6 November 1908 in Antwerp. One reason {{given for}} the change was to allow Red Star to hire non-American crews at lower cost. She made her maiden voyage under the Belgian flag the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> May 1911, Kroonlands crew, acting on rumors of an impending British mariner's strike, refused to sign on for the ship's next voyage, forcing Red Star to hire a replacement crew.|$|E
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> Mumbai, two motorcycle-borne MNS {{supporters}} hurled bottles at Amitabh Bachchan's bungalow at Juhu. A {{group of}} MNS workers barged inside the booking {{office of the}} Grant Road railway station, damaged the booking office windows and tore off posters of a newly released Bhojpuri film put up there. Party workers resorted to stone throwing {{in some parts of}} Kandivli, a North-Mumbai suburb that has a sizeable North Indian lower middle-class population. In the Central-Mumbai suburb of Bandra, a clash ensued when MNS workers tried to plant party flags at an open market dominated by North Indians.|$|E

5|$|With {{the coming}} of night, most of the crowd that had {{accompanied}} the storming of the palace earlier that day departed, intending to resume looting the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> the meantime, Alexios III, who resided in the Blachernae Palace in the city's northwestern corner, rallied for a counter-strike. A small force was dispatched with boats around the city's peninsula to the Hodegetria Monastery north of the Great Palace. It was led by the emperor's son-in-law Alexios Palaiologos, who at that point was likely regarded as his heir-apparent, and quickly made contact with the Varangians who had held out in the palace's northern parts.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E

5|$|In late September, the Italian fleet, {{including}} Fiume, made a sweep for a British troop convoy from Alexandria to Malta, {{but it made}} {{no contact}} with the British ships. Fiume was present in the harbor at Taranto when the British fleet launched the nighttime carrier strike on Taranto {{on the night of}} 1112 November, but she was not attacked in the raid. Another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late November resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. The Italian fleet left port on 26 November and clashed with the British fleet the <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>in</b> an engagement that lasted for about an hour. Campioni broke off the action because he mistakenly believed he was facing a superior force, the result of poor aerial reconnaissance. The British heavy cruiser HMS Berwick was hit twice by 203mm rounds during the engagement, either fired by Fiume or her sister Pola.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S. Virgin Islands, heavy {{rainfall}} associated with Otto shattered numerous records for October across the US Virgin Islands, {{with a maximum}} total of 21.52in (547mm) reported in Red Hook, Saint Tomas. The rain flooded roads and prompted officials opened shelters on all three islands on October6. In Saint Croix, a roadway section leading into Enfield Green collapsed, temporarily cutting the neighborhood off to traffic until a makeshift roadway was created the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> La Vallée, on the island's north shore, floods and landslides affected low-lying areas. Traffic on Saint Thomas and Saint John initially remained unhindered; however, as the rain continued for several days, flooding, rockslides and asphalt erosion forced authorities to close several roads and highways. Damage estimates from the storm reached $2million across the islands.|$|E
5|$|Josefson {{participated in}} the {{pre-season}} camp with the Devils in September, but was assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Albany Devils after the camp. Josefson was called up to the Devils on 14 October 2010, and made his NHL debut the <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>in</b> a 3–2 victory against Colorado Avalanche at the Prudential Center. Josefson was slashed on {{his left hand and}} later fell on the same hand during the game against San Jose Sharks on 27 October, this caused a ligament in his thumb to tear, and forced him to undergo surgery. At last, Josefson returned from his injury on 7 January 2011, when the Albany Devils played against the Charlotte Checkers. Josefson scored his first NHL goal against Al Montoya of the New York Islanders on 12 March 2011. The Devils failed to reach the playoffs and Josefson ended up with three goals and ten points in 28 regular season games.|$|E

500|$|After the {{protracted}} fighting of {{the previous}} few days, Bapaume was {{now in the hands}} of the New Zealanders. Before the town was abandoned by the Germans, numerous booby traps had been set which had to be found and deactivated over the <b>next</b> <b>days.</b> <b>In</b> the meantime, the Rifle Brigade moved forward and established a new line [...] east of Bapaume. A similar distance beyond this lay the villages of Frémicourt and Bancourt, to which the Germans had retreated.|$|R
