5|$|Some Commandos were {{designated}} for different tasks from the start. No. 2 Commando was always {{intended to be}} a parachute unit. In June 1940 they began parachute training and were re-designated the 11th Special Air Service (SAS) Battalion, which eventually became the 1st Parachute Battalion. After their re-designation a <b>new</b> <b>No.</b> 2 Commando was formed. Other Commandos were grouped together in a larger formation known as Layforce and sent to the Middle East. The Special Air Service and the Special Boat Squadron were formed from the survivors of Layforce. The men of No. 14 (Arctic) Commando were specially trained for operations in the Arctic Circle and specialised in using small boats and canoes to attack shipping. The joint service unit No. 30 Commando was formed for intelligence gathering. Its members were trained in the recognition of enemy documents, search techniques, safe cracking, prisoner handling, photography, and escape techniques.|$|E
5|$|The Gallaher {{couple and}} their six {{children}} arrived in Auckland after a three-month voyage, {{and from there}} sailed to Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty, before their final voyage to Katikati. On arrival they found the settlement scheme was not what they had envisaged or been promised: the land allocated to the family required enormous work to be broken in before being suitable for farming, there was no easy access to water, and the settlement was very hilly. It had been hoped that James would be employed as the agent for the Donegal Knitting Company in New Zealand, {{which was to be}} established by Lord George Augusta Hill. But Hill died unexpectedly and his successor did not support the initiative. As the family's poor quality land was insufficient to make a living, the children's mother Maria soon became the chief breadwinner after she obtained a position teaching for £2 a week at the <b>new</b> <b>No.</b> 2 School.|$|E

The following season, he won two poles, at Bristol and Martinsville respectively, but fell five spots in the standings. Despite seven top-tens in 1998, Wallace and Square D left FILMAR to drive Andy Petree Racing's <b>new</b> <b>No.</b> 55 entry. Wallace finished in the top-ten five times and had a career-best twenty-second-place finish in points. After only one top-ten in 2000 and a 26th-place finish in the points, he departed the team. The sole top-ten came in his second-place finish to Dale Earnhardt, in the then Winston 500 (now Camping World RV Sales 500) which was Earnhardt's final victory. Wallace pushed Earnhardt to the front in four laps to the lead.|$|E

Harris sent a letter on April 26, 2005 to defense appropriations subcommittee Chairman C. W. Bill Young, in which Harris sought $10million for a Navy project backed by Wade. In the letter, Harris emphasized the importance of the project, asking that it be added to her list of five priorities and identifying it as her <b>new</b> <b>No.</b> 3. Harris later released the April 26, 2005 letter for legal scrutiny, but neither she nor Young would turn over the request form (RFP) used for the proposal.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Ziskind Mintz, an Ashkenazi merchant, started {{claiming}} in 1846 {{that only}} those growing in Parga are not grafted, and therefore kosher for the ritual. He claimed {{that under the}} previous Ottoman system, citrons could only be planted in Parga {{under the control of}} Ali Pasha, who collected all proceeds for the Ottoman empire, and those were thus the only citrons known as kosher and un-grafted through the years. Since the rules have been changed, and farmers are allowed to earn their income and pay only a tax, that's how the plantations have expanded to Agia and Preveza. And since those places are <b>new,</b> <b>no</b> one could not be sure whether those picked from newly planted trees, were grafted or not, at least without careful tree checking upon picking.|$|E

25|$|Wimbledon is {{considered}} the world's premier tennis tournament and the priority of the Club is to maintain its leadership. To that end a long-term plan was unveiled in 1993, intended {{to improve the quality}} of the event for spectators, players, officials and neighbours. Stage one (1994–1997) of the plan was completed for the 1997 championships and involved building the <b>new</b> <b>No.</b> 1 Court in Aorangi Park, a broadcast centre, two extra grass courts and a tunnel under the hill linking Church Road and Somerset Road. Stage two (1997–2009) involved the removal of the old No. 1 Court complex to make way for the new Millennium Building, providing extensive facilities for players, press, officials and members, and the extension of the West Stand of the Centre Court with 728 extra seats. Stage three (2000–2011) has been completed with the construction of an entrance building, club staff housing, museum, bank and ticket office.|$|E
25|$|The first No 2 Commando, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Colonel Jackson, did not carry out any {{operations}} before being turned over to parachute duties. After the formation of the 11th SAS Battalion a <b>new</b> <b>No.</b> 2 Commando was formed, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel Augustus Charles Newman, from a new batch of volunteers. The first action that men from No. 2 Commando were involved in was two troops supporting No. 3 Commando in the Vaagso raid in December 1941. The next action involving men of No. 2 Commando was Operation Musketoon in September 1942. This was a raid against the Glomfjord hydroelectric power plant in Norway. The raid, commanded by Captain Graeme Black, MC, landed by submarine and succeeded in blowing up pipelines, turbines and tunnels, effectively destroying the generating station; the associated aluminium plant was shut down permanently. One commando was killed in the raid; another seven were captured while trying to escape the area and were taken to Colditz Castle. From there they were taken to Sachsenhausen concentration camp and executed, the first victims of Adolf Hitler's Commando Order. The three remaining commandos managed to escape to Sweden, eventually returning to No. 2 Commando.|$|E
25|$|This {{was in part}} {{facilitated}} by improved transportation in the area. The Crane and Thomas Iron Companies wanted a railroad to bring local ore to their furnaces, but faced strong local opposition when attempting to gain a charter. As a compromise, the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Plank Road corporation was chartered on July 2, 1853, to build a plank road from the ore pits to the furnaces. A short section of plank road was constructed, but the exceptional weight of the ore wagons quickly destroyed it. Renewed efforts to palliate the local farmers were successful, and the plank road was renamed and rechartered on April 20, 1854 as the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Railroad. The C began hauling ore from the mines near Fogelsville in 1857. In 1864, it was further extended to a connection with the East Pennsylvania Railroad at Alburtis and in 1865, to the magnetite mines at Rittenhouse Gap. Improvements to the physical plant also occurred, building No. 6 stack in 1868. The company survived the Panic of 1873 and the subsequent poor iron market, and No. 5 stack was rebuilt in 1877, introducing new firebrick heat exchangers (stoves) to heat the blast, rather than the iron pipes heretofore used. No. 3 stack collapsed in 1879 while out of blast, and Nos. 1 and 2 were subsequently demolished. A <b>new</b> <b>No.</b> 1 and 3 were built, and the site of No. 2 used for stoves for the new furnaces, which were built in 1880 and put in service in 1881. Joshua Hunt resigned the superintendency on January 1, 1882, {{six months before the}} death of his father-in-law, David Thomas.|$|E
