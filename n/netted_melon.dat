40|$|For the {{breeding}} of Japanese <b>netted</b> <b>melon,</b> {{various types of}} foreign cultivars have been utilized for improving adaptability, disease and pest resistance, fruit quality and so on. However, {{little is known about}} their genetic diversity and relationships, since most cultivars derived from crosses between various horticultural groups. To figure out the genetic structure of Japanese melon, in this study, 57 melon accessions from three horticultural groups were examined using 55 RAPD markers produced by 24 RAPD primers. Genetic diversity of the Japanese <b>netted</b> <b>melon</b> was as high as those of cultivar groups of Groups Cantalupensis and Inodorus, while it was low in Group Conomon irrespective of large variations in fruit traits. Cluster analysis and PCO analysis based on genetic distance showed that Group Conomon was distantly related to other melon accessions. Among the latter, European cantaloupe (nonnetted) and American open-field type (netted) proved to be genetically close, while England glasshouse melon (netted) including ‘Earl’s Favourite’ is distantly related to these two groups and closely related with Group Inodorus. It was therefore suggested that England glasshouse type was established from hybrids between European cantaloupe and Group Inodorus. Japanese <b>netted</b> <b>melon</b> was most closely related with England glasshouse type, irrespective of the fact that various kinds of melon accessions have been crossed to improve adaptability, disease resistance and so on. In contrast, pure line cultivars of the Japanese <b>netted</b> <b>melon</b> bred by pure line selection from ‘Earl's Favourite’ or by crossing ‘Earl’s Favourite’ with ‘British Queen’ were confirmed to be mostly homogenous, and it was difficult to establish RAPD markers to discriminate each cultivar.

Several potential limitations to the NIR assessment of fruit, including the variation in TSS within fruit and the effect of fruit storage conditions on the robustness of calibration models, were considered in this study. Outer mesocarp TSS was 3 TSS units higher at the stylar end of the fruit compared with the stem end, and the TSS of inner mesocarp was higher than outer tissue and more uniform across spatial positions. The linear relationship between the outer 10 mm and the subsequent middle 10 mm of tissue varied with fruit maturity [e. g. 42 days before harvest (DBH), r 2 = 0. 8; 13 DBH, r 2 = 0. 4; 0 DBH, r 2 = 0. 7], and with cultivars (at fruit maturity, Eastern Star 2001 r 2 = 0. 88; Malibu 2001 r 2 = 0. 59). This relationship notably affected NIR calibration performance (e. g. based on inner mesocarp TSS; R c 2 = 0. 80, root mean standard error of cross-validation (RMSECV) = 0. 65, and R c 2 = 0. 41, RMSECV = 0. 88 for mature Eastern Star and Malibu fruit, respectively).

Measures of gas exchange (photosynthesis, leaf transpiration, stomatal conductance, internal CO 2 concentration) were also performed. From these measurements the efficiency of water use was calculated. For the characteristics evaluated, it can be concluded that among the types of melon, frog skin melon type is the most productive. The highest yield occurred in plants with two fruits per plant. Regardless of the number of fruits and the type of melon total soluble solids was higher than the minimum recommended for marketing.

O experimento foi realizado em casa de vegetação, utilizando-se fertirrigação e vasos plásticos de 13 L, preenchidos com fibra da casca de coco Golden Mix® Misto 98. As mudas foram produzidas em bandejas de poliestireno expandido de 128 células e quando estavam com a primeira folha definitiva completamente desenvolvida foram transplantadas aos vasos. Foram avaliados o rendilhamento da casca, os diâmetros longitudinal e transversal do fruto, o índice de formato do fruto, os diâmetros longitudinal e transversal do lóculo, o índice de formato do lóculo, a espessura do mesocarpo, a massa média dos frutos e a produção por planta. Não houve interação entre os fatores estudados. Nas condições deste experimento, a condução de dois frutos por planta resultou em maior rendilhamento da casca, maior diâmetro transversal do fruto, maior diâmetro longitudinal do lóculo e maior massa média dos frutos. Porém, as maiores produções por planta foram observadas quando conduzidas com três frutos. Os híbridos Fantasy e Shinju 200 apresentaram as melhores características de frutos e maiores produções. The pruning {{of fruits}} of <b>net</b> <b>melon</b> cultivars was evaluated in this study. The cultivars Maxim, Louis, Fantasy, Shinju 200 and Bônus nº 2 were evaluated in plants bearing {{two and three}} fruits. The experimental design was of randomized blocks in factorial scheme 5 x 2, with four replications and the plants arranged in the spacing of 1. 0 m between lines and 0. 5 m between plants. The experiment was conducted in greenhouse, using fertirrigation and plastic pots of 13 L, filled with coconut fiber Golden Mix® Misto 98. The seedlings were grown in expanded polystyrene trays of 128 cells and transplanted to pots when the first definitive leaf was completely developed. We evaluated the roughness of the rind, the longitudinal and transversal diameters of fruits, the fruit shape index, the longitudinal and transversal diameters of the locule, the locule shape index, {{the thickness of the}} mesocarp, the average weight of fruits and the production per plant. No interaction between the studied factors was detected. For the conditions of this experiment, the conduction of two fruits per plant generated greater transverse diameter of fruit, greater longitudinal diameter of the locule, greater roundness of the rind and greater average weight of fruits. However, the greatest productions per plant was observed in plants bearing three fruits. The hybrids Fantasy and Shinju 200 presented the best fruit characteristics and greater production...|$|R
