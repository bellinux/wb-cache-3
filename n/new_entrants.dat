5|$|On 23 October 2001, the Competition Authority granted {{permission}} for SAS to purchase Braathens. The rationale {{was that there}} were no other realistic purchasers for the airline, and that a bankruptcy was imminent without the take-over. As a condition, the authority decided to regulate a ban on frequent flyer programs, and stated that it would ban cross-subsidization aimed at underbidding or operating at a loss to force <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> out of the market.|$|E
50|$|Plans {{offered by}} <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> ISPs {{frequently}} have higher data caps than those offered by incumbent ISPs, with some <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> plans offering unlimited bandwidth {{during times of}} the day when overall network use is lower. Some plans offered by <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> carriers also feature no data cap at all, which is something not frequently offered in retail plans provided by incumbent ISPs.|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} we study how existing market coverage affects {{the outcome of}} the Internet channel entry game between an existing retailer and a <b>new</b> <b>entrant.</b> A market is not covered when some consumers with low reservation prices are priced out by existing retailers and do not purchase. In a model with multiple existing retailers and a potential <b>new</b> <b>entrant,</b> we demonstrate that when entry costs are equal, one of the existing retailers enters the Internet channel first. However, if the market is covered by existing retailers before entry, then because of the threat of Internet channel entry by the potential <b>new</b> <b>entrant,</b> retailer entry cannibalizes existing retail profits - cannibalizing at a loss. In addition, if a potential <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> has a slight advantage in Internet channel entry costs and the market is not covered by existing retailers, then the <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> enters the Internet channel first. If the market is covered by existing retailers, then the <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> must have a larger Internet channel entry cost advantage to be first to enter the Internet channel.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how competitive structure between a vertically integrated firm (dominant firm) and a non-integrated firm (<b>new</b> <b>entrant)</b> affects access charge. We consider {{the situation where}} access charge (input price) is regulated by the government but the dominant firm affects actual rate through lobbying activity or manipulation of accounting. We find that leadership by the integrated firm in product markets (<b>new</b> <b>entrant)</b> reduces access charge when the integrated firm is as efficient as (highly less efficient than) the <b>new</b> <b>entrant.</b> We also find that vertical separation increases (reduces) access charge when the integrated firm is as efficient as (highly less efficient than) the <b>new</b> <b>entrant...</b>|$|R
5|$|The club {{controversially}} {{rejoined the}} First Division in 1919, despite only finishing sixth in 1914–15, the last season of competitive football before the First World War had intervened — although {{an error in}} the calculation of goal average meant Arsenal had actually finished fifth, an error which was corrected by the Football League in 1975. The First Division was being expanded from 20 teams to 22, and the two <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> were elected at an AGM of the Football League. On past precedent the two places would {{be given to the}} two clubs that would otherwise have been relegated, namely Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. Instead one of the extra places was awarded to Chelsea - who had been the victims of a betting controversy - and a ballot was called for the remaining place. The candidates included 20th-placed Tottenham Hotspur and, from the second division, Barnsley (who had finished third); Wolves, (fourth); Birmingham (fifth later amended to sixth); Hull City (seventh); and Nottingham Forest (eighteenth).|$|E
5|$|The website asserts to its {{visitors}} {{that all}} performers engaged in sexual activities {{depicted in the}} videos appear of their own volition and feel bliss and gratification from the experience. The majority of <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> to the adult film industry enjoyed their work with Fucking Machines because they discovered it was more socially acceptable to perform with a sexual device, rather than a human partner. Public relations manager for Kink.com Thomas Roche observed in a 2009 interview that Fucking Machines {{did not have a}} focus on BDSM material. In September 2010 the site had a live filming with an audience of 40 spectators, followed by the introduction in November 2010 of an interactive format in which viewers could watch shoots and recommend devices for the participants. By 2012 the site had 500 hours of archival footage with adult film performers, including Alexis Texas, Flower Tucci, and Sasha Grey.|$|E

40|$|As a new {{software}} licensing model, software-as-a-service (SaaS) is gaining tremendous popularity across the globe. In this study, we investigate {{the competition between}} a <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> and an incumbent in a SaaS market, and derive the optimal market entry strategy for the <b>new</b> <b>entrant.</b> One interesting finding is that, when its product quality is significantly {{lower than that of}} the incumbent, the <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> should adopt an instant-release strategy, i. e., releasing its product {{at the start of the}} planning horizon. If the initial quality gap of the two products is small, the <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> is better off adopting a late-release strategy, i. e., deferring the release of the new product until its quality surpasses that of the existing product. We also find that instant-release and late-release are essentially low-quality-low-price and high-quality-high-price strategies, respectively. In addition, we explore the scenario where the two competing products are partially compatible, and characterize the impact of asymmetric incompatibility on the two vendors’ market strategies at equilibrium. We find that the <b>new</b> <b>entrant’s</b> zero-profit region expands as the level of incompatibility between the two competing products increases. Moreover, if the <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> adopts the instant-release strategy, its profit decreases with the level of incompatibility. When the level of incompatibility is sufficiently high, the instance-release strategy may not be viable for the <b>new</b> <b>entrant.</b> On the other hand, if the <b>new</b> <b>entrant</b> adopts the late-release strategy, its profit increases with the level of incompatibility from its product to the incumbent’s, but decreases with the level of incompatibility in the other direction...|$|R

25|$|Deadweight loss {{does not}} account for the effect taxes have in {{leveling}} the business playing field. Businesses that have more money are better suited to fend off competition. It is common that an industry {{with a small amount of}} very large corporations has a very high barrier of entry for <b>new</b> <b>entrants</b> coming into the marketplace. This is due to the fact that the larger the corporation, the better its position to negotiate with suppliers. Also, larger companies may be able to operate at low or even negative profits for extended periods of time, thus pushing out competition. More progressive taxation of profits, however, would reduce such barriers for <b>new</b> <b>entrants,</b> thereby increasing competition and ultimately benefiting consumers.|$|E

25|$|The Norwegian airline {{market was}} {{deregulated}} from 1 April 1994.

Quite the contrary, the deregulation initially led Braathens to terminate the coastal services to Northern Norway, although it maintained flights to Bergen and Trondheim. From 19 April 1998 Braathens also served Ålesund with its Boeing 737-700. A radar was installed at the airport in 1998. The same year all the electronics in the control tower were replaced.|$|E
