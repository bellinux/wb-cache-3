40|$|This paper proposes an {{extension}} of the classical theory of <b>normal</b> <b>prices</b> to an n-commodity economy with exhaustible natural resources. The central idea is developed by two analytical steps. Firstly, it is assumed that a given flow of an exhaustible resource in short supply is combined with the coexistence of two methods of production using that resource. Sraffa’s equations are reinterpreted by adopting the concept of effectual supply of natural resources and avoiding the assumption of perfect foresight. Secondly, in force of the Hotelling rule, some limitations are imposed to the dynamics of <b>normal</b> <b>prices</b> and, by implication, to technical and structural change. A comparison, between such approach and the notion of intertemporal equilibrium with natural resources, introduces the central argument. The final part of the paper presents a critical assessment of recent works in this area. The conclusions are focused on methodological issues.

A positive argument tries to find a distinctive characterization of those extensions in the productive and financial conditions that make effective the autonomous changes in aggregate demand. It suggests a notion of normal capacity utilization as a range of distributions of normal utilization, related to the cost minimizing choice of techniques and to the persistence of the long term expectations of <b>normal</b> <b>prices</b> underlying the investment decisions.

A deal table may be made in a [...] few hours, a piece of cloth in a few weeks, and a moderate-sized [...] house in a month or little more. Tables, cloth, and houses may be [...] produced with certainty in any quantity required.

The [...] nature of manufactures is, in general, such as to fit them [...] admirably for distant transport. Any considerable elevation of [...] price, therefore, is pretty certain to attract supplies from [...] remote sources. (3.) Further, considered in their relation to [...] human needs, I think it may be said of manufactured goods, that [...] either the need for them is not very urgent, or, where it happens [...] to be so, substitutes ... may easily be found.

The shortest [...] period within which additions can be made to the supply of food [...] and raw material of the vegetable kind is in general a year, and, [...] if the commodity be of animal origin, the minimum is considerably [...] larger. (2.) Again, the farmer may decide upon the breadth of [...] ground to be devoted to a particular crop, or upon the number of [...] cattle he will maintain; but the actual returns will vary [...] according to the season, and may prove far in excess or far in [...] defect of his calculations. These circumstances all present [...] obstacles to the adjustment of supply and demand, and consequently [...] tend to produce frequent and extensive deviations of the market [...] from the <b>normal</b> <b>price.</b> Nor are the other conditions of the case [...] such as to neutralize the influence of such disturbing agencies. [...] (3.) The nature, indeed, of some of the principal agricultural [...] products fits them sufficiently well for distant transport, and so [...] far tends to correct fluctuations of price. But, on the other [...] hand, (4.) the relation of these products to human wants is such [...] as greatly to enhance that tendency to violent fluctuation [...] incident to the conditions of their production. More especially is [...] this the case with the commodity, whatever it may be, which forms [...] the staple food of a people. For observe the peculiar nature of [...] human requirements with reference to such a commodity. They are of [...] this kind, that, given the number of a population, the quantity of [...] the staple food required is nearly a fixed quantity, and this [...] almost irrespective of price. Except among the poorest, increased [...] cheapness will not stimulate a larger consumption; while, on the [...] other hand, all, at any cost within the range of their means, will [...] obtain their usual supply. The consequence is that, when even a [...] moderate deficiency or excess occurs in the supply of the staple [...] food of a people, in the one case (a), the competition of [...] consumers for their usual quantum of food rapidly forces up the [...] price far out of proportion to the diminution in the supply; in [...] the other (b), no one being inclined to increase his usual [...] consumption, the competition of sellers, in their eagerness to [...] find a market for the superfluous portion of the supply, is [...] equally powerful to depress it.” ...|$|E
