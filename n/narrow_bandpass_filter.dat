50|$|An {{inductor}} {{connected to}} a capacitor forms a tuned circuit, which acts as a resonator for oscillating current. Tuned circuits are widely used in radio frequency equipment such as radio transmitters and receivers, as <b>narrow</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> to select a single frequency from a composite signal, and in electronic oscillators to generate sinusoidal signals.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{technique}} to extract low power UWB pulse radio signals, near to noise level, using statistical correlation technique in frequency domain. The receiver consists of many <b>narrow</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> which extract energy either from transmitted UWB signal, interfering channels or noise. Transmitted UWB data can be eliminated by statistical correlation of multiple <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter</b> outputs. Super-regenerative oscillators, tuned within UWB spectrum, are designed as <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters.</b> Summers and comparators perform statistical correlation. ...|$|R

50|$|A CTCSS decoder {{is based}} on a very <b>narrow</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter</b> which passes the desired CTCSS tone. The filter's output is amplified and rectified, {{creating}} a DC voltage whenever the desired tone is present. The DC voltage is used to turn on, enable or unmute the receiver's speaker audio stages. When the tone is present, the receiver is unmuted, when it is not present the receiver is silent.|$|E
50|$|Analog tone decoders used in {{telephone}} and two-way radio systems {{are designed to}} work in a balance between expensive, complicated filtering and low cost simplicity. The engineering problem is to make the simplest circuit that will work reliably. A decoder generally tries to filter audio input to strip off every audio component except a sought-after, specific tone. In part, a decoder is a <b>narrow</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter.</b> A signal that gets through the narrow filter is rectified into a DC voltage which is used to switch something on or off.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of the photosensitive properties of a <b>narrow</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter</b> based on a Ge(15) Sb(20) S(65) spacer fabricated by electron beam deposition. For a single layer, near the optical bandgap of this chalcogenide material, {{the efficiency of the}} photo-bleaching increases as the central wavelength of the light source for exposure decreases. The maximum relative photo-induced change of the optical thickness reaches about 1 %. By using controlled light exposure around 480 nm of a photosensitive <b>narrow</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter</b> centered at 1550 nm, we obtained a spatially localized shift of its peak wavelength up to 5. 4 nm. This property is used to perform, {{for the first time at}} our knowledge, the post trimming of a <b>narrow</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter</b> with a light beam.

40|$|<b>Narrow</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> have {{historically}} been designs of quarter waves at the passband wavelength, and have been monitored at the turning points using the passband wavelength. By direct monitoring at the passband wavelength, errors {{have been shown to}} be primarily self compensated, and have allowed much better performance than could otherwise be expected. The turning points are difficult to detect precisely and accurately because the change in transmittance with thickness becomes zero at the desired termination point. By proper design with non-quarter-wave layers, essentially the same spectral performance can be achieved by layer terminations that are far enough from turning points to be significantly more sensitive termination points. The design approach is to maintain the optical thickness of the reflector layer pairs at one half-wave of the passband wavelength, but change the ratio of the optical thicknesses of the high and low index layers. These can be adjusted enough so that the thicker layers contain two turning points and the last turning point in the layer can be more accurately and precisely determined. The error compensation benefit from the historic method should be maintained. This leads to potentially improved control during deposition and monitoring of <b>narrow</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{optimization}} studies {{have led to}} a new multilayer design for a <b>narrow</b> <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter.</b> Its unique feature is the absence of traditional spacer layers. Electric field intensity profiles indicate that it is similar to a double cavity but the spacer layers are defined by pairs of low- and high-index layers forming partitioned cavities. Other parti-tionings have been studied. It is shown that the partitioning configuration can control somewhat the electric field intensity profile, which should lead to higher transmission. Another advantage of partitioned cavity filters is that they are less sensitive to random thickness errors in fabrication and are amenable to an error compensation scheme.
