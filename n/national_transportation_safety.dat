2500|$|On March 31, 2017 the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> and <b>Safety</b> Board {{released}} Accident Brief [...] which {{concluded that}} “the most likely sinking scenario involved gradual flooding in the aft void, which caused the aft deck to submerge and the vessel {{to enter a}} lolling condition, resulting in a sudden list to starboard. In this state, water would then have likely entered other spaces through downflooding points, causing progressing flooding and sinking by the stern without capsizing.” ...|$|R
5|$|Although not {{the pilot}} in command, {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident. In the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board report on the crash, investigators concluded that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, the US <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight safety {{recommendations}} related to locating aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations; and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image recorder and tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders.|$|E
5|$|<b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board (NTSB) and Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) {{investigations}} {{determined that}} evasive maneuvers undertaken by Flight 663 {{to avoid an}} oncoming Pan Am Boeing 707 caused the pilot to suffer spatial disorientation and lose control of the aircraft. The accident is the third-worst accident involving a DC-7.|$|E

25|$|Since then, {{considerable}} {{work has}} gone into creating more and more sophisticated dummies. Hybrid II was introduced in 1972, with improved shoulder, spine, and knee responses, and more rigorous documentation. Hybrid II became the first dummy {{to comply with the}} American Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) for testing of automotive lap and shoulder belts. In 1973, a 50th percentile male dummy was released, and the <b>National</b> Highway <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Administration (NHTSA) undertook an agreement with General Motors to produce a model exceeding Hybrid II's performance in a number of specific areas.|$|R
5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} published a detailed final report eleven months later on March 11, 1997. From the official point of view, the pilot in command was flight instructor Reid, who {{was the only one}} on board rated to fly the aircraft. The investigation focused on his decision-making prior to takeoff and his actions once airborne.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{acting on}} a {{recommendation}} made by the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board (NTSB) during its investigation of Comair 5191, the FAA issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to pilots to positively confirm their position before crossing the hold-short line onto the take-off runway, and again when initiating takeoff. And in May, {{acting on a}}nother NTSB recommendation, the FAA advised that pilot training should include specific guidance on runway lighting requirements for take-off at night.|$|E
5|$|June 20, 1998: A Greyhound bus on a {{scheduled}} trip from New York City to Pittsburgh ran off a road near Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania, {{and hit a}} truck parked in an emergency parking area. Six passengers and the driver died. The <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was the driver's use of a sedating antihistamine and driver fatigue, due to an irregular work-rest schedule.|$|E

40|$|The NSTSCE {{stakeholders}} have jointly funded {{this research}} {{for the purpose of}} developing and disseminating advanced <b>transportation</b> <b>safety</b> techniques and innovations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Several research reports suggest that some people are characterologically more inclined to have more crashes than other people. It appears that individual differences in personality and performance may predispose some people to a greater risk of being involved in a crash. This document serves as the final report for a <b>National</b> Surface <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Center for Excellence (NSTSCE) research project that assessed the concept of high-risk commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers and the characteristics associated with these drivers. The current study used naturalistic data collected during the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) -funded Drowsy Driver Warning System Field Operational Test (DDWS FOT) and Naturalistic Truck Driving Study (NTDS) projects. METHODS The rates of at-fault and non-fault safety-critical events (SCEs) per mile were calculated for each participant. A cluster analysis using the flexible beta method was performed on the participants’ rates of at-fault and non-fault SCEs/mile to assess group membership (i. e., risky, average, an...|$|R

Efforts to reduce fatalities on the nation's roadways include the <b>National</b> Highway <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Administration's (NHTSA) New Car Assessment Program. Under this program, NHTSA conducts vehicle crash and rollover tests to encourage manufacturers to make safety improvements to new vehicles and provide the public with information on the relative safety of vehicles. GAO examined (1) how NHTSA's New Car Assessment Program crash tests vehicles, rates their safety, and reports the results to the public; (2) how NHTSA's program compares to other programs that crash test vehicles and report results to the public; and (3) the impact of the program and opportunities to enhance its effectiveness. ...|$|R
5|$|Since the {{aircraft}} had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals {{had died in}} the incident, the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board (NTSB) was legally required to investigate. On the morning of September 1, the NTSB chief in Alaska, James Michelangelo, received an order from the NTSB in Washington {{at the behest of the}} State Department requiring all documents relating to the NTSB investigation to be sent to Washington, and notifying him that the State Department would now conduct the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} Brazilian Air Force Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) and the U.S. <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board (NTSB). The NTSB, {{in accordance with the}} provisions of ICAO Annex 13, participated in the investigation representing the state of manufacture of the Boeing, state of registry and operator of the Embraer, and state of manufacture of the Honeywell avionics equipment installed in both planes.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the <b>National</b> <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to loss {{of power in the}} left engine, the flight crew were unable to control their aircraft before it struck the roof of the apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E

40|$|Computational vehicle {{models for}} the {{analysis}} of lightweight material performance in automobiles have been developed through collaboration between Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the <b>National</b> Highway <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Administration, and George Washington University. The vehicle models have been verified against experimental data obtained from vehicle collisions. The crashed vehicles were analyzed, and the main impact energy dissipation mechanisms were identified and characterized. Important structural parts were extracted and digitized and directly compared with simulation results. High-performance computing {{played a key role in}} the model development because it allowed for rapid computational simulations and model modifications. The deformation of the computational model shows a very good agreement with the experiments. This report documents the modifications made to the computational model and relates them to the observations and findings on the test vehicle.

40|$|Dowie accused Ford Motor Company {{executives}} of callously deciding {{to produce and}} continuing to markethe Pinto (which he labeled a "firetrap") even after company crash tests showed that its gas tank would mptu•e in rea•end collisions at relatively low speeds [Dowie, 1977]. This reprehensible decision, according to Dowie's interpretation, derived from a cost/benefit analysis which purportedly demonstrated that settling the few inevitable lawsuits filed by burn victims or thek families would cost less than the eleven dollars per car needed to fix the defective tanks [Green, 1997, p. 130]. Dowie, along with well-known consumer advocate Ralph Nader, {{held a press conference}} in Washington, D. C. on August 10, 1977, to draw national attention to the case. One day later, the <b>National</b> Highway <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Administration (NHTSA) began its own investigation of the Pinto gas tank [Cullen, Maakestad, and Carender, 1987].
