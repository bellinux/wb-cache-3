40|$|A {{recently}} developed bean RFLP linkage map {{was used to}} identify genetic elements affecting quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in two contrasting common bean genotypes, BAT- 93 and Jalo EEP 558, under two levels of mineral nitro-gen: low – 0. 25 mM NH 4 NO 3 and a high – 6 mM NH 4 NO 3. QTLs affecting nodule number (NN) and response to Xanthomonas campestris bv. phaseoli, which causes common bacterial blight (CBB) were identified and mapped. Analyses of 70 F 2 -derived F 3 families, using the F 1, the two parents, and a nodulation-defective mutant (Nod) inoculated with R. tropici UM 1899 under both levels of N showed significant differences (P< 0. 0001) among the F 3 families for NN.
