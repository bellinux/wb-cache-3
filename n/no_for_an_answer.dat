5|$|During {{a tour of}} the Philippines {{the month}} after the Yesterday and Today furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had {{expected}} them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations. They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty. Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Sam {{returns in}} 1995, after her brothers, on a boys holiday in Spain, catch her {{in bed with}} David Wicks (Michael French), and force her to return. Sam had tried to build herself {{a career as a}} model, but it had not gone to plan and she had ended up working as a hostess in a bar. Back in Walford Sam tries to {{continue}} her fling with David and when this goes nowhere she tries to come between Ricky and his girlfriend, Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). Initially Ricky thinks he still has feelings for Sam, but eventually realises he is better off with Bianca and tries to let Sam down gently. However Sam won't take <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> and purposefully kisses an innocent Ricky in front of Bianca, causing them to split. Despite this, Ricky will not reconsider getting back with Sam and opts to try to make amends with Bianca. Sam is forced to admit defeat. Soon after, she meets a Spanish man named Guillermo, who is holidaying in England. When he invites her to join him in Spain she leaps at the chance and leaves Walford again in March 1996.|$|E
500|$|The {{office workers}} {{are forced to}} use the stairs while the {{elevator}} is being serviced, a situation everyone deems [...] "Stairmageddon". A badly out-of-shape Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) undergoes a painful struggle in climbing the stairs, only to be greeted at the top by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) ordering him {{to take part in}} an important sales call. Unwilling to climb the stairs a second time, Stanley refuses. Since the client is a friend of Stanley, Dwight (who is operating without concern for niceties now that the documentary has driven home the point that he will never be the branch manager at Dunder Mifflin) cannot take <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> so he shoots Stanley with bull tranquilizers. With help from Clark Green (Clark Duke), Dwight gets Stanley to the car. The tranquilizers inexplicably make Stanley intoxicated, and his unusually jolly mood helps them close the sale. When Stanley regains full awareness, he is pleased to learn that he made a sale with no effort whatsoever, but still refuses to take the stairs again. He instead knocks himself out with one of Dwight's darts, leaving Dwight and Clark {{to figure out how to}} get him back upstairs.|$|E

500|$|... "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] {{was written}} by Aguilera, Lucas Secon and Olivia Waithe, with {{production}} done by Secon. An up-tempo song, it combines a variety of genres, including dance and disco, [...] "subtle" [...] tones of Latin, hip hop, and pop. It also features elements of dancehall. The track, which lasts for a duration of , is a [...] "smoky, sultry" [...] song. It features an [...] "old-school hip-hop loop" [...] and vocal samples, as well as [...] "dirty bass" [...] which creates an [...] "underground" [...] feel. On [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love", Aguilera keeps her use of melisma to a minimum which allows for a [...] "relaxed and playful" [...] vocal performance. Lyrically, the song talks about Aguilera's attempts to impress the man she is flirting with. She has [...] "fallen hook, line and sinker for him" [...] and will not take <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> Chris Younie for 4Music wrote that his favorite lyric in the song is [...] "Baby I'm burning up, you got that red hot kinda love", which the song's hook is built around. According to Sal Cinquemani for Slant Magazine, it features [...] "a catchy pre-chorus, and an even catchier chorus." [...] Andrew Hampp for Billboard compared the song's structure to those performed by Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue which they have [...] "specialized in for years." ...|$|E
500|$|Favreau {{planned to}} cast a {{newcomer}} in the title role, as [...] "those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star. The success of X-Men and Spider-Man without being star-driven pieces reassures [...] that the film does have an upside commercially." [...] However, in September 2006, Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the role. Favreau chose Downey, {{a fan of the}} comic, because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining [...] "The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark." [...] Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> saying, [...] "It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [...] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways. While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by Elon Musk. Downey said, [...] "Elon was someone Tony probably hung out with and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} quarter, {{competitors}} would answer ten general questions, {{all of which}} were either multiple choice or [...] "true or false". One point was awarded <b>for</b> <b>a</b> correct <b>answer</b> and there was <b>no</b> penalty <b>for</b> <b>an</b> incorrect <b>answer.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} quarter, {{competitors}} would answer up to twenty questions on a specialty topic in a maximum period of two minutes. The topics would be {{chosen by the}} contestants several weeks prior to the show.

5000|$|For {{the weekly}} series, a bonus round was added after each duel. The winner was asked a single [...] "Max Question," [...] {{for which the}} winner got one chip and seven seconds. <b>A</b> correct <b>answer</b> doubled the contestant's {{winnings}} from the just-played duel, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> potential maximum of $100,000.

60|$|This is all I need {{trouble you}} with, and I have endeavoured to keep clear of all {{idiosyncratic}} propositions {{as much as}} in me lies. Of course such <b>a</b> letter calls <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>answer.</b> <b>As</b> this legacy opinion to you {{takes the form of a}} donation inter vivos it will, I hope, escape duty.|$|R
50|$|Two teams, {{consisting}} of one civilian and one celebrity, competed. The civilian {{on the first}} team pushed a button, which randomly selected one of six categories and a point value (either 100, 250, or 500 depending on difficulty). Marshall would ask them a question in that category; getting it right won the points, with <b>no</b> penalty <b>for</b> <b>an</b> incorrect <b>answer.</b> The second team repeated the process.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{would hardly}} take <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> from me, when I said I wouldn't {{go to the}} Haskeths for him; and when I fairly shook him off, {{he wanted me to}} ask you to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|The men who {{rise in the}} law are the men who {{decline to}} take <b>No</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> Mr. Pedgift the elder had risen in the law; and Mr. Pedgift the elder now {{declined}} to take <b>No</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> But all pertinacity--even professional pertinacity included--sooner or later finds its limits; and the lawyer, doubly fortified as he was by long experience and copious pinches of snuff, found his limits at the very outset of the interview. It was impossible that Allan could respect the confidence which Mrs. Milroy had treacherously affected to place in him. But he had an honest man's regard for his own pledged word--the regard which looks straightforward at the fact, and which never glances sidelong at the circumstances--and the utmost persistency of Pedgift Senior failed to move him a hairbreadth from the position which he had taken up. [...] "No" [...] is the strongest word in the English language, {{in the mouth of}} any man who has the courage to repeat it often enough, and Allan had the courage to repeat it often enough on this occasion.|$|E
6000|$|A man's {{character}} often {{give the}} lie to his tongue [...] A lie has short legs [...] Appearance {{of a professional}} pallbearer [...] Architects should be driven and not followed [...] Consequential or inconsequential irrespective of their size [...] Deal with a fool according to his folly [...] Impervious to hints, and would not take <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> [...] Old enough to know better, and {{too old to be}} taught [...] That abominable word [...] "like" ...|$|E
5000|$|The winner played [...] "Short Subjects", {{in which}} 15-second videotapes of celebrities were shown one by one. Unlike the main game, there was <b>no</b> penalty <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{incorrect}} <b>answer,</b> and contestants could buzz-in and answer {{as much as}} they wanted on each clip. Each correct answer won {{the same amount of money}} won in the main game, and solving five subjects won an extra $1,000.|$|R
50|$|A {{film clip}} and {{descriptive}} clue is played. A question and three answer choices {{about the subject}} of the clip is asked to the home viewers. The family can confer but only the captain can buzz in and give the answer. The first family to buzz in and answer correctly earns 20 points. An incorrect answer gives the opposing family <b>a</b> chance to <b>answer</b> from the remaining choices. <b>No</b> penalty <b>for</b> <b>an</b> incorrect <b>answer.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{connected}} to a heart monitor that broadcast his/her heartbeat to the studio audience, the studio contestant chose one of 10 categories and had 15 seconds to <b>answer</b> <b>an</b> open-ended question asked by Tomarken. <b>A</b> correct <b>answer</b> increased the front-game winnings by whatever multiplier was hidden behind the category; nine of them increased it by 10, the last by 100. There was <b>no</b> penalty <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wrong <b>answer.</b> The maximum possible grand prize was $1.5 million.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, and I {{hope she}} never may be. I {{declared}} the notion {{was not to}} be entertained for a moment; but Urania never, in her life, would take <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> and she talked me nearly out of my senses, then bade me go home, think it over, and discuss it with my excellent and prudent daughter; as if all the thinking and talking in the world could make it anything but more intolerable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fifteen years," [...] she answered. [...] "I was a {{bit older}} than 'im. But I've never looked my age, they tell me. Lord, what a boy 'e was! Swept you off your feet, like. 'E wasn't the only one. I'd got a way with me, I suppose. Anyhow, the men seemed to think so. There was always a few 'anging about. Like flies round a 'oney-pot, Mother used to say." [...] She giggled. [...] "But 'e wouldn't take <b>No</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> And I didn't {{want to give it}} 'im, neither. I was gone on 'im, right enough. No use saying I wasn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, {{they met}} at Brighton, I believe. She used {{to walk on the}} chain pier before breakfast, and he met her there. If he chooses, he can make any one do what he likes, because he does not {{understand}} <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> Then when she came home, he used to meet her on the bridge, when you sent her out for a turn in the evening, and sometimes she would make me take her out walking to meet him. Don't you see how utterly miserable it was for me; when they had volunteered this help all out of kindness, it was impossible for me to speak to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He was {{extremely}} excited {{by what he}} had been doing, for it was inevitable {{that there should be a}} certain emotion in calling up the spectre of dishonor before a family a thousand years old. But he went back to the inn and contrived to wait there, deliberately, for the next two hours. He thought it more than probable that Urbain de Bellegarde would give <b>no</b> sign; <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> to his challenge, in either sense, would be a confession of guilt. What he most expected was silence--in other words defiance. But he prayed that, as he imagined it, his shot might bring them down. It did bring, by three o'clock, a note, delivered by a footman; a note addressed in Urbain de Bellegarde's handsome English hand. It ran as follows:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{game was}} played in three rounds. In {{each of the first}} two rounds the teams were shown four {{categories}} with four questions. The questions were each worth ten points in the first round, and twenty in the second round, with <b>no</b> penalty <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wrong <b>answer.</b> The second round had one question replaced with a [...] "Grudge Match" [...] in which the one member of each team competed against each other in a bizarre stunt of some sort.|$|R

60|$|Cynthia was deprived, too, of that thrilling first view of {{the capital}} from the train which she had pictured, for night had fallen when they reached Washington likewise. As the train slowed down, she leaned {{a little out of}} the window and looked at the shabby houses and shabby streets {{revealed}} by the flickering lights in the lamp-posts. Finally they came to a shabby station, were seized upon by a grinning darky hackman, who would not take <b>no</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> and were rattled away to the hotel. Although he had been to Washington but once in his life before, as a Lincoln elector, Jethro was greeted as an old acquaintance by this clerk also.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope and}} believe it can. My advice is this: Don't take <b>No</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> Give her time enough to reflect on what she has done, and to regret it (as I believe she will regret it) in secret; trust to my {{influence}} over her to plead your cause for you at every opportunity I can find; wait patiently for the right moment, and ask her again. Men, being accustomed to act on reflection themselves, are a great deal too apt to believe that women act on reflection, too. Women do nothing of the sort. They act on impulse; and, in nine cases out of ten, they are heartily sorry for it afterward.|$|E

How many young men have I seen here, admirably dressed--rich, you would say. No, no. The mont-de-piete permits no secrets. To swank, mademoiselle, what is it? To deceive the world, yes.
