5000|$|Although {{not a legal}} requirement, {{accreditation}} {{is often}} stipulated and supported by local governments. In order to ensure equally high standards of certification across Europe, the European Commission for Enterprise and Industry set out a European-wide policy for accreditation. This ensures consistency in the accreditation market and is {{designed to protect the}} consumer. Accordingly, it is mandatory for every European member-state to have a single <b>national</b> <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Body</b> (NAB). In the UK, the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) is the formally appointed <b>National</b> <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Body,</b> following the adoption the European regulation. The new Regulation (EC Regulation 765/2008), which came into force on 1 January 2010, requires each member state to appoint a single <b>national</b> <b>accreditation</b> <b>body.</b> UKAS has therefore been appointed by statutory instrument providing, for the first time, a legal basis for its role. The accreditation Regulations 2009 (Statutory Instrument No 3155/2009) making the appointment were signed on 30 November 2009 by Lord Drayson, Minister for Science and Innovation, and announced in a Written Statement to Parliament. In the statement, Lord Drayson said: “The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) has a long standing and effective relationship with UKAS that both parties value highly. We will continue to work together not only to ensure that the requirements of the EC Regulation are fulfilled but to improve the quality and breadth of accreditation in the UK.” Outside of Europe, there is not a set regulation. For example, in the USA there are multiple Accreditation Bodies, whereas within Australasia there is the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand. For those countries without a designated <b>National</b> <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Body,</b> the International Accreditation Forum lists member Accreditation Bodies International Accreditation Forum Members and Recognition Categories [...] that only accredit competent bodies, providing buyer confidence.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Using a questionnaire, the EC 4 (European Communities Confederation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine) has {{collated}} {{an inventory}} of the accreditation procedures for medical laboratories in the EU. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Accreditation of medical laboratories in {{the countries of the}} EU is mostly carried out in cooperation with <b>national</b> <b>accreditation</b> <b>bodies.</b> These <b>national</b> <b>accreditation</b> <b>bodies</b> work together in a regional cooperation, the European Cooperation for Accreditation (EA). Professionals are trained to become assessors and play a prominent role in the accreditation process. The extent of the training is diverse, but assessors are kept informed and up-to-date by annual meetings. The frequency of assessments and surveillance visits differs from country to country and ranges from 1 to 4 years. More harmonisation is needed in this respect, based on a frequency that can be pragmatically handled by laboratory professionals. In the majority of EA <b>bodies,</b> <b>accreditation</b> is carried out on a test-by-test basis. Many professionals would prefer accreditation of the entire service provided within the actual field of testing (i. e., haematology, immunology, etc.), with accreditation granted if the majority of tests offered within a service field fulfil the requirements of the ISO 15189 standard. The scope of accreditation is a major point of discussions between the EC 4 Working Group on Accreditation and representatives of <b>accreditation</b> <b>bodies</b> in the EA Medical Laboratory Committee...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} of this survey was to collect information from the <b>National</b> <b>Accreditation</b> <b>Bodies</b> in collaboration with European Cooperation for Accreditation on the accreditation status of the countries Methods: The survey included two questionnaires and a data protection form distributed by e-mail.

Moreover, they argue that the emphasis placed on the role of ‘metrology’ is overstated in the literature. Rather, the concept of ‘standards’ better captures the more complex, underlying processes involved in {{the construction of}} the TSR. They present evidence gathered through a review of data collected from SDOs’ and NABs’ websites, official documents, international trade agreements, and the directories published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the International Organization for Standardization. They argue that the TSR acts as a techno-economic network that is global in reach and serves a key coordinating role in facilitating international trade. As such they see the TSR as fundamental to the movement towards ‘governing at a distance’ that is part and parcel of the neoliberal shift from government to governance...|$|R

40|$|Summary: ISO 15189 is {{very well}} {{accepted}} as the principle standard for accreditation of medical laboratories in the European countries. In cooperation with the EA linked <b>national</b> <b>accreditation</b> <b>bodies</b> mutual lateral agreement is well accepted for this standard. It makes {{it possible that the}} accreditation is accepted in other countries. Medical laboratory professionals {{play a key role in}} the assessment process. Their choice, training and constant education are essential to ascertain that accreditation adds value in the treatment of the patients. It should contribute to the continuous improvement of all laboratories. Some preliminary results of a questionnaire concerning the present status of accreditation in the countries of the European Union are presented. It shows quite diversity in the accreditation process in relation to the interval between assessment visits and the frequency of surveillance visits. The Working Group on Accreditation of the EC 4 will use the input of this questionnaire and the content of some ILAC and EA guidelines, to offer Essential Criteria on some of these aspects.

They are involved in collecting and reporting information to government bodies (for example, in the USA, the United States Department of Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System), to the public (e.g., Common Data Set, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities's University-College Accountability Network), and various college guide publishers (e.g., U.S. News & World Report and College Board).
