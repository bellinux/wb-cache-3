5|$|In 2015, a modernized {{version of}} Thumbelina {{appears in the}} Disney Junior series, Goldie and Bear. In the episode Thumbelina's Wild Ride, Thumbelina (voiced by Debby Ryan with her singing voice {{provided}} by Shannon Chan-Kent) is hired to babysit for Goldie and Bear. The two friends are initially put off by her small stature, thinking she's almost helpless. When she tries getting the kids a snack, she falls down the kitchen sink and slides into the river behind the house. Goldie and Bear try to save her, but soon see that Thumbelina is resourceful, agile, and can lift several times her own weight. She saves herself from the river and even rescues the kids when they fall in trying to save her. The kids take an instant liking to Thumbellina and can't wait for the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> babysits.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to prepare her {{daughter}} Bernice, then only five years old, for the funeral, she {{tried to explain to}} her that the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> saw her father he would be in a casket and would not be speaking. When asked by her son Dexter when his father would return, King lied and told him that his father had only been badly hurt. Senator Robert Kennedy ordered three more telephones to be installed in the King residence for King and her family to be able to answer the flood of calls they received and offered a plane to transport her to Memphis. Coretta spoke to Kennedy the day after the assassination and asked if he could persuade Jacqueline Kennedy to attend her husband's funeral with him.|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery of MTV News {{called the}} video [...] "jaw-dropping". Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly {{commented that the}} video was similar to visuals by Lady Gaga and Madonna, further noting that Aguilera [...] "did indeed seem desperate" [...] in the [...] "unoriginal" [...] clip, saying that [...] "maybe she should have gone in a totally {{different}} direction to avoid comparisons". On behalf of Rolling Stone, Daniel Kreps stated that [...] "Aguilera assumes no less than a dozen different guises, all scantily clad, ranging from carbon copies of Lady Gaga (borrowing heavily from her unique wardrobe), Madonna, Beyoncé, Gwen Stefani, the girls from Robert Palmer's [...] "Simply Irresistible" [...] video and Michelle Pfeiffer's S Catwoman from Batman Returns. Despite the video's attempt to shock, it's unlikely Aguilera will ever out-Gaga Gaga or out-controversy Madonna. ... Hopefully <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> steps {{in front of the}} lens she'll be more herself and less like everyone else". NME ranked the [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] music video at number 8 on its list of the [...] "50 Worst Music Videos Ever".|$|E
50|$|This quote {{shows that}} Ellen's {{movement}} from family to family really took {{a toll on}} her. She {{does not want to}} accumulate possessions because she knows she won't be able to take them with her the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she's</b> forced to move.|$|R
50|$|<b>Next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she's</b> at the club, bandleader Chick Morgan (Hoagy Carmichael) informs {{her that}} Dan has quit. Cathy {{arranges}} {{to meet him}} on a public beach as if by coincidence and introduces herself as Mary Willey, a woman of limited means who is also blind. They strike up a relationship and Dan explains how he lost his sight from another driver's car crash.|$|R
50|$|Joey Perrone {{decides to}} stay with Stranahan on the island. Corbett has taken an {{interest}} in Ricca, and invites her to share some time on his farm in New Zealand. Rolvaag finally closes the case and moves back to his native Minnesota. Before he goes, Rose tells him her mother lives in Minnetonka and coquettishly invites him to lunch the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she’s</b> in town.|$|R
500|$|In {{the first}} episode of the series, [...] "The Eleventh Hour", Prisoner Zero tells the Doctor, [...] "The {{universe}} is cracked. The Pandorica will open. Silence will fall". The Pandorica was also mentioned by River in [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] as the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> would meet him, and the Doctor dismissed the Pandorica as a fairy tale. In River's timeline this takes place before [...] "The Time of Angels"/"Flesh and Stone". The painting of the TARDIS explosion passes through several characters from previous episodes: the painting is created by Vincent Van Gogh (Tony Curran) after his meeting with the Doctor ("Vincent and the Doctor"). The painting is found in 1941 by Winston Churchill (Ian McNeice) and Professor Bracewell (Bill Paterson) from [...] "Victory of the Daleks", and River steals the painting from Liz 10 (Sophie Okonedo), who previously appeared in [...] "The Beast Below". The recurring phrase [...] "silence will fall" [...] {{came to a head}} in the next series with the introduction of the alien species and organisation of the Silence. The message on Planet One, [...] "ΘΣ Φ ΓΥΔϟ," [...] starts with [...] "Theta Sigma (ΘΣ)," [...] which was The Doctor's [...] "nickname" [...] in his academy days.|$|E
500|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema applied for a position as an engineering technician with the Colorado Department of Transportation. She was given an assignment on the Straight Creek Tunnels project, but her supervisor misread her resume and thought he was hiring [...] "James". When the supervisor discovered the department had hired a woman, she was instead tasked with doing support work from the office. There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site: One supervisor stated that if she entered, [...] "Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they'd never come back". The workers, most of whom had a mining background, expressed a common superstition that a woman brought bad luck to a mine. One worker insisted, [...] "It's a jinx. I've seen too many die after a woman was in the tunnel." [...] Bonnema sued the department {{for the right to}} work inside the tunnel. She countered she was in better shape and more agile than most of the men working on the tunnel. Emboldened by the passage of an equal rights law in Colorado, she finally entered the tunnel, with an entourage of reporters, on November 9, 1972. Some workers did walk off the job; at least one yelled, [...] "Get those women out of here". She remained determined and re-entered the tunnel a few days later. The <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> dressed in coveralls, and was even assigned tasks {{on the roof of the}} tunnel overlooking the men below. Surprised that nobody apparently noticed she was a woman, she stated, [...] "I had a good disguise".|$|E
2500|$|Wallace Wimple (Thompson, using a {{voice he}} later {{employed}} for the MGM-animated Droopy) – Wimple was a soft-spoken {{man in the}} Caspar Milquetoast vein. He would enter the episode uttering his mush-mouth catchphrase, [...] "Hello, folks!" [...] Wimple might recite a verse he'd written but more often would recount the latest incident in his ongoing battle with Sweetie-Face, his [...] "big old wife” who had the physique and demeanor of a drill sergeant on a bad day. Sweetie-Face was a regular unseen character (actually of course, this being radio, unheard character), appearing in the show only from Wallace's perspective. “Wimp,” as Fibber called him, often reported provoking an overreaction from Sweetie-Face, followed by his attempt at revenge {{in a way that}} could be prankish, painful, or in some stories potentially fatal. One day (03/09/48) when he asked Sweetie-Face what she was doing, Wallace said she told him she was [...] "practicing her weight-lifting." [...] Wallace said he told Sweetie-Face, [...] "My goodness, you do that every time you get up out of a chair.” [...] “Uh oh,” fretted Molly. “And then when I regained consciousness,” continued Wimple, “she'd left the room.” With a typically evil chuckle, Wallace said that he got even by bolting her 200-pound barbell to the floor, causing her to strain so hard the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> lifted weights that she popped her girdle. Passive-aggressive behavior edging well over the line into domestic violence characterized Wimple's stories. Radio network censors in the 1940s blocked any reference to certain subjects including sex, but the dark humor about domestic violence that was allowed here and in The Honeymooners would likely not be written into a network-TV sitcom today. Though the term “wimp” as used to describe a weak-willed person predated Fibber McGee and Molly, the Wimple character and Fibber's nickname for him may have contributed to a surge in popular use.|$|E

She doesn’t know where the storm of her life will take her. She has been spending her days in his memories, and asks him to hide behind her memories.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll remember, mother. I hate {{not to be}} obliging, but I {{guess it}} would have saved us lots of trouble if I'd said No in the beginning. I tried to, but she would go. Poor Jill! I'll {{take better care of}} her <b>next</b> <b>time.</b> Is <b>she</b> very ill, Mamma?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why? Was Wynn saying anything? I shall {{get this}} right <b>next</b> <b>time</b> you come,' <b>she</b> muttered, and knitted her pale brows again over the {{diagrams}} of Taubes, Farmans, and Zeppelins.|$|R

60|$|Again she dove {{and with}} strong strokes {{headed for the}} shore. The <b>next</b> <b>time</b> that <b>she</b> rose she was terrified to see the prahu looming close behind her.

5000|$|The {{revelation is}} not that Amy Ryan is good. It’s that she’s this good ... Ryan, whose range has been {{apparent}} for years, in dramatic performances nominated for Tonys (Uncle Vanya) and Oscars (Gone Baby Gone), {{as well as in}} nuanced comic turns on television shows like The Office, manages a feat in Love, Love, Love that she’s never accomplished so fluidly before: taking charge. She delivers a front-and-center performance of such beguiling dynamism (in a thoroughly convincing English accent) that you feel this Roundabout Theatre Company production has done for her precisely what was intended. It exposes a new facet of her talent — and leaves us with that uplifting itch, to be there the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she’s</b> on a stage.|$|R
5000|$|The Truth About Love Tour {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from music}} critics. Jason Bracelin from the Las Vegas Review-Journal called P!nk a: [...] "party {{girl with a}} heart of gold", while Jim Harrington from Mercury News said Pink [...] "is the new gold standard", adding that: you definitely don't {{walk away from a}} Pink show shrugging your shoulders and muttering 'meh.' It's far more likely that fans practically skip out of the building, feeling extremely satisfied with the experience and determined to tell others to 'go see Pink <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she's</b> in town' ... Honesty is, as they say, the best policy. And, after watching the Truth About Love Tour, I can honestly say that few, if any, performers deliver better pop spectacles than Pink.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile, Mrs. Stetson {{had been}} {{revolving}} a design in her mind, and one afternoon she did some canvassing {{on her own}} account. The <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> saw Lovell she said: ...|$|E

60|$|Anne made up {{her mind}} that the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> wrote a story she wouldn't ask anybody to criticize it. It was too discouraging. She would not read the story to Gilbert, {{although}} she told him about it.|$|E
60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>time</b> that <b>she</b> saw him he {{was without}} the stripes that had adorned his sleeve. He had been broken {{to the level of}} private for his {{lateness}} that night; and as Phyllis considered herself to be the cause of his disgrace her sorrow was great. But the position was now reversed; {{it was his turn to}} cheer her.|$|R
60|$|Maggie felt a {{great relief}} in {{adjourning}} the decision. She was free now {{to enjoy the}} minutes of companionship; she almost thought she might linger a little; the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> they met <b>she</b> should have to pain Philip by telling him her determination.|$|R
60|$|Philip saw her embarrassment, and, amused, turned Athelny's {{attention}} to something else. That {{was never a}} very difficult thing to do. But evidently her mother spoke of the matter later, for <b>next</b> <b>time</b> Philip came <b>she</b> took the opportunity when they were alone {{for a couple of minutes}} to refer to it.|$|R

5000|$|A {{possible}} sequel film to the 2017 Wonder Woman {{was part}} of the topic of conversation when Carter joined the Library of Congress's Coolidge Auditorium. During production of the 2017 Wonder Woman feature film, director Patty Jenkins approached Carter to appear in a cameo role in the film, as Carter confirmed, [...] "Patty asked me to do a cameo in this. She was in England, and I was doing my concerts", Carter said, explaining she had singing engagements that made her unavailable. [...] "At that time we couldn't get our timing together. So, this <b>next</b> <b>time,</b> if <b>she</b> writes me a decent part, I might do it".|$|R
5000|$|Two {{editions of}} The Last Man were {{published}} by Henry Colburn in London in 1826, and one edition in Paris in 1826 by Galignani. A pirated edition was printed in America in 1833. The Last Man received the worst reviews {{of all of}} Mary Shelley's novels: most reviewers derided the very theme of lastness, which had become a common one in the previous two decades. Individual reviewers labelled the book [...] "sickening", criticised its [...] "stupid cruelties", and called the author's imagination [...] "diseased". The reaction startled Mary Shelley, who promised her publisher a more popular book <b>next</b> <b>time.</b> Nonetheless, <b>she</b> later spoke of The Last Man {{as one of her}} favourite works.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>next</b> <b>time</b> he came <b>she</b> said: “I {{have been}} {{thinking}} over what you said, monsieur, and I feel {{that it would be}} cowardly indeed if I were to shrink from incurring some little danger for the sake of Lucien. I know that he would give his life for me. We were to have been married in a fortnight, when they came and carried him off to the war. Now tell me exactly {{what you want me to}} do.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{everything}} but most things. And she didn't tell {{me so much}} as I guessed it. She'll tell me more the <b>next</b> <b>time.</b> <b>She</b> will behave properly now about coming in to see me; I told her she ought to.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The doctor listened unwillingly to this {{prudential}} counsel, and {{was only}} comforted by the faithful promise of his satellite, that [...] "the old woman should," [...] as he expressed it, [...] "be ta'en canny the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> trespassed on the bounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Dean, {{she gets}} no thanks for {{reminding}} you {{of what you}} had forgotten. <b>Next</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> will leave your letters to their fate, and perhaps it will be as well, if they have such a bad effect upon your temper, Gerald." ...|$|E
5000|$|One morning, Lauren hears a noise {{coming from}} the upper floor of the house. She goes upstairs to {{investigate}} but finds no one there. Lauren goes upstairs again the <b>next</b> day. This <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> finds a man sitting {{in one of the}} bedrooms. The man's appearance varies each time Lauren sees him, but in this first incarnation, he is described as [...] "smallish and fine-boned resembling a kid, sandy-haired and roused from deep sleep" [...] (43).|$|R
50|$|Regularly bullied {{in school}} {{because of his}} homosexuality, Billy found solace outside {{the gates of the}} Avengers Mansion. One day, Billy {{encountered}} the Avenger the Scarlet Witch, who told him to stand his ground the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> it happens. <b>She</b> then touched his head, causing a red light to flash briefly. The flash healed Billy's wounds, and a few weeks later, he stood up for another kid being bullied, demonstrating his mutant powers for the first time, and nearly killing his tormentor.|$|R
60|$|This {{could not}} last, thought Giselle. Giovanni must {{take her away}} soon--the very <b>next</b> <b>time</b> he came. <b>She</b> would not suffer these terrors for ever so much silver. To speak with her sister made her ill. But she was not uneasy at her father's watchfulness. She had begged Nostromo not {{to come to the}} window that night. He had promised to keep away for this once. And she did not know, could not guess or imagine, that he had another reason for coming on the island.|$|R
