5|$|The {{process of}} garbage {{collection}} involves reading and rewriting {{data to the}} flash memory. This means that a new write from the host will first require a read of the whole block, a write of {{the parts of the}} block which still include valid data, and then a write of the <b>new</b> <b>data.</b> This can significantly reduce the performance of the system. Some SSD controllers implement background garbage collection (BGC), sometimes called idle garbage collection or idle-time garbage collection (ITGC), where the controller uses idle time to consolidate blocks of flash memory before the host needs to write <b>new</b> <b>data.</b> This enables the performance of the device to remain high.|$|E

Also included is the Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) to provide sensor data to personnel on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{favored a}} more frugal {{approach}} to the military budget, feeling the military was too susceptible to influence from large corporations arguing for expensive and unnecessary programs. As the Kennedy administration brought more emphasis on conventional warfare, Shoup sought to use increased funds to improve military logistics. He is credited with formulating an entirely new system of financial management, supply, and inventory management. He also created a <b>new</b> <b>Data</b> Processing Division to centralize the data processing functions of several combat service support branches.|$|E
25|$|As can be {{seen from}} the {{definitions}} above, if one already has price and quantity data (or, alternatively, price and expenditure data) for the base period, then calculating the Laspeyres index for a new period requires only <b>new</b> price <b>data.</b> In contrast, calculating many other indices (e.g., the Paasche index) for a new period requires both <b>new</b> price <b>data</b> and <b>new</b> quantity <b>data</b> (or, alternatively, both <b>new</b> price <b>data</b> and <b>new</b> expenditure <b>data)</b> for each <b>new</b> period. Collecting only <b>new</b> price <b>data</b> is often easier than collecting both <b>new</b> price <b>data</b> and <b>new</b> quantity <b>data,</b> so calculating the Laspeyres index for a new period tends to require less time and effort than calculating these other indices for a new period.|$|R

5|$|The SSD {{controller}} {{will use}} any free blocks on the SSD for garbage collection and wear leveling. The {{portion of the}} user capacity which is free from user data (either already TRIMed or never written in the first place) will look the same as over-provisioning space (until the user saves <b>new</b> <b>data</b> to the SSD). If the user saves data consuming {{only half of the}} total user capacity of the drive, {{the other half of the}} user capacity will look like additional over-provisioning (as long as the TRIM command is supported in the system).|$|E
5|$|Theorists {{also try}} to {{generate}} or modify models {{to take into account}} <b>new</b> <b>data.</b> In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is written}} to the flash memory in units called pages (made up of {{multiple}} cells). However, the memory can be erased only in larger units called blocks (made up of multiple pages). If the data {{in some of the}} pages of the block are no longer needed (also called stale pages), only the pages with good data in that block are read and rewritten into another previously erased empty block. Then the free pages left by not moving the stale data are available for <b>new</b> <b>data.</b> This is a process called garbage collection (GC). All SSDs include some level of garbage collection, but they may differ in when and how fast they perform the process. Garbage collection {{is a big part of}} write amplification on the SSD.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} of polar motion (wobble) made by space-geodetic methods are compared with older optical measurements. Multitaper spectra {{of these data}} show that the retrograde (clockwise) annual wobble is much larger in the older <b>data</b> than the <b>newer</b> <b>data,</b> implying systematic errors in the older techniques. Two additional analyses show evidence for a small retrograde motion in the <b>newer</b> <b>data,</b> {{which appears to be}} consistent between data types. This implies that the excitation of the retrograde wobble must be about half of the prograde excitation. None of the available estimates of the excitation shows full agreement with these observations...|$|R

5|$|In the 2017 {{description}} of K. langenbergensis, Schwarz et al. used the 2015 phylogenetic dataset of Alan Turner, which was revised to remove irrelevant characteristics, add K. langenbergensis and T. grandinaris, and correct {{flaws in the}} coded traits of K. guimarotae (due to low-resolution images, inaccuracies in the original reconstruction, and the acquirement of <b>new</b> <b>data).</b> The phylogenetic trees recovered by this analysis consistently found that Atoposauridae, represented by Knoetschkesuchus, Theriosuchus, and Alligatorium, forms a monophyletic clade. Within this clade, a close relationship between K. langenbergensis and K. guimarotae, excluding other Theriosuchus species, was strongly supported, providing further evidence of these two species forming a separate genus. In some trees, T. grandinaris was also close to Knoetschkesuchus. The most parsimonious arrangement is reproduced below.|$|E
5|$|The TRIM command {{also needs}} {{the support of}} the SSD. If the {{firmware}} in the SSD does not have support for the TRIM command, the LBAs received with the TRIM command will not be marked as invalid and the drive will continue to garbage collect the data assuming it is still valid. Only when the OS saves <b>new</b> <b>data</b> into those LBAs will the SSD know to mark the original LBA as invalid. SSD Manufacturers that did not originally build TRIM support into their drives can either offer a firmware upgrade to the user, or provide a separate utility that extracts the information on the invalid data from the OS and separately TRIMs the SSD. The benefit would be realized only after each run of that utility by the user. The user could set up that utility to run periodically in the background as an automatically scheduled task.|$|E

In researching this work, Filitti sought input from the genealogical school in Greece and Macedonia, and from Romanian diplomats working in Istanbul.
