25|$|The {{other major}} {{sticking}} point, which is reportedly causing concern at government level, {{is that the}} majority of people going to Potsdamer Platz are visitors to the city, implying that the original vision of the development as a linking element attracting Berliners themselves, and Berliners {{from both sides of the}} former divide, has not really materialised. There are criticisms that the development does not sit easily with or connect with its surroundings, and as a result Berliners have had difficulty accepting it as theirs (despite the fact that the choice of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan was partly because it was the only one to address the way the development juxtaposed with the Cultural Forum immediately to the west, although the Cultural Forum has itself faced similar criticisms of its own). Another, more psychological factor that has played a part here is that a long-standing mutual distrust or antipathy felt between former East Berliners and West Berliners (Ossis and Wessis according to the well-known slang terms), is still very much in evidence in the city and elsewhere in Germany, and bold civil engineering projects and architectural statements are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> go away by themselves. Politicians past and present have been accused of short-sightedness in speculating that they would.|$|E
2500|$|Georgescu takes {{a dismal}} {{view on the}} future of mankind. On the one hand, his general {{argument}} is that the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is decreasing as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use; but on the other hand, he finds that restraining ourselves collectively on a permanent and voluntary basis for the supposed benefit of unknown future generations is running counter to our biological nature as a species considered: We cannot help ourselves. Consequently, the world economy will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse in the future. From that point on, ever deepening scarcities will cause widespread misery, aggravate social conflict throughout the globe, and intensify man's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood. A prolonged 'biological spasm' of our species will follow, ultimately spelling the end of mankind itself, as man has now become completely and irreversibly dependent on the industrial economy for his biological existence. We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it.</b> We are doomed to downfall, destruction and demise. Predicts Georgescu: ...|$|E

2500|$|Game {{journalist}} Geoff Keighley, who {{had been}} in discussions with Murray and Hello Games throughout the development, had expressed concern to Murray in the year leading up to release, according to Keighley in September 2016. He said he was [...] "internally conflicted" [...] {{about the state of the}} game near its release, recognising that many of the features that Murray had been talking about were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it,</b> and compared Murray to Peter Molyneux who had overpromised on a vision for his games that ultimately fell short. Keighley had expressed to Murray his concern that the $60 price tag was a bit steep for the current state of the game and recommended that they take an early access approach instead. According to Keighley, Murray said he didn't want to be around Keighley any more as he was [...] "a little too negative about the game and 's assessment of where the team was at". Keighley felt that Murray could not [...] "rip off that band-aid" [...] and explain exactly what had made it and had to be cut for the game prior to release, and in the end appeared to [...] "disrespect his audience". As such, Keighley sympathised with those that felt they were misled by the marketing. Keighley rekindled the relationship with Murray since launch, and anticipated discussing more of what happened near release with him. Sony Chairman Shawn Layden, in November 2016, stated that Hello Games had an [...] "incredible vision" [...] and a [...] "very huge ambition" [...] for No Man's Sky, and that the developers are still working to update the game to bring it to what they wanted, adding that [...] "sometimes you just don't get all the way there at the first go". Layden further expressed that from Sony's side, they recognised that they [...] "don't want to stifle ambition" [...] and force a specific style of play onto their games.|$|E

60|$|We {{struck out}} westward or northwestward from Calcutta on an {{itinerary}} of a zig-zag sort, which would {{in the course}} of time carry us across India to its northwestern corner and the border of Afghanistan. The first part of the trip carried us through a great region which was an endless garden--miles and miles of the beautiful flower from whose juices comes the opium, and at Muzaffurpore we {{were in the midst of}} the indigo culture; thence by a branch road to the Ganges at a point near Dinapore, and by a train which would have missed the connection by a week but for the thoughtfulness of some British officers who were along, and who knew the ways of trains that are run by natives without white supervision. This train stopped at every village; for no purpose connected with business, apparently. We put out nothing, we took nothing aboard. The train bands stepped ashore and gossiped with friends a quarter of an hour, then pulled out and repeated this at the succeeding villages. We had thirty-five miles to go and six hours to do it in, but it was plain that we were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it.</b> It was then that the English officers said it was now necessary to turn this gravel train into an express. So they gave the engine-driver a rupee and told him to fly. It was a simple remedy. After that we made ninety miles an hour. We crossed the Ganges just at dawn, made our connection, and went to Benares, where we stayed twenty-four hours and inspected that strange and fascinating piety-hive again; then left for Lucknow, a city which is perhaps the most conspicuous of the many monuments of British fortitude and valor that are scattered about the earth.|$|E

But Schnabel eventually didn’t want to tackle such an ambitious and colossal undertaking in adapting and filming such a large and dense project. The second project that Schnabel {{was interested}} in directing was Nick Tosches’s novel, In the Hand of Dante. Johnny Depp’s production company, Infinitum Nihil, bought the rights to book in 2008. Schnabel said, “It belongs to Johnny, but I’m <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> {{for a couple of}} years. We’re gonna work on writing it, developing it. We didn’t sign anything. It’s just something Johnny asked me to read and I think it’s a great book…” The novel is a multi-generational narrative revolving around Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy.  The novel intertwines three characters from three different eras. The initial intention with the project was to have Johnny Depp produce the film and to play all three leads. However, Schnabel stated “I’m <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> for a couple of years. We’re and Depp gonna work on writing it, developing it. We didn’t sign anything. It’s just something Johnny asked me to read and I think it’s a great book…” ...|$|E
