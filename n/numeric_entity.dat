40|$|As you design Web pages, {{there may}} be {{occasions}} {{when you want to}} insert characters that arenot available on your keyboard. Or you may wish to use characters that could be confused as HTML markup or JavaScript code (the> and < symbols, for example). You also may find that you have a need to use certain international characters. In all of these situations, you can solve your problem by making use of entities. The numeric and character entities listed in the tables that follow are taken from the International Standards Organization’s list of Latin characters (ISO 8859 - 1). As you browse the list, you will notice that some of the characters include both numeric and character entities, while others have only the <b>numeric</b> <b>entity.</b> A number of other entity lists are available, including lists of mathematical operators, symbols, Greek letters, and additional internationalization characters. These {{can be found at the}} World Wide Consortium’s Web site, at www. w 3. org/TR/html 4 /charset. html#didx. character_entity_references. Commonly Used Entities The following table contains a list of commonly used entities and symbols. You’ll find most of the characters you need in this list. More extensive lists may be found at the W 3 C’s HTML page, www. w 3. org...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{efficient}} video retrieval technique where a threshold is provided to control between retrieval time and accuracy. The proposed technique has an added benefit {{that it can be}} implemented in scenarios where videos are described by abstract features i. e. features that are not <b>numeric</b> <b>entities</b> themselves rather composed of <b>numeric</b> <b>entities.</b> Experimental results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique over contemporary techniques that are applicable on abstract features...|$|R
40|$|Content based labels, {{associated}} with image sequences in contemporary video indexing methods, can be textual, numerical {{as well as}} abstract, including colour-histograms and motion co-occurrence matrices. Abstract features or indices are not explicitly <b>numeric</b> <b>entities</b> but rather are composed of <b>numeric</b> <b>entities.</b> When multiple abstract features are involved, distance metrics between image sequences need to be weighted. Most feature weighting methods in the literature assume that the space is numeric (either discrete or continuous) and so not applicable to abstract feature weighting. This paper elaborates some feature weighting methods applicable to abstract features and both binary (feature selection) and real-valued weighting methods are discussed. The performance of different feature selection and weighting methods are provided and a comparative study based on motion classification-experiments is presented...|$|R

The difficulty arises from the conversion ambiguity between verbal and written language in both directions. Non-lexical vocabulary items such as <b>numeric</b> <b>entities,</b> dates, times, abbreviations and acronyms are particularly ambiguous. This paper describes a finite-state trans-ducer based approach that improves proper transcription of these entities. The approach involves training a language model in the written language domain, and integrating verbal expansions of vo-cabulary items as a finite-state model into the decoding graph con-struction. We build an inverted finite-state transducer to map written vocabulary items to alternate verbal expansions using rewrite rules. Then, this verbalizer transducer is composed with the n-gram lan-guage model to obtain a verbalized language model, whose input labels are in the verbal language domain while output labels are in the written language domain. We show that the proposed approach is very effective in improving the recognition accuracy of <b>numeric</b> <b>entities.</b> Index Terms — language modeling, verbalization, finite-state transducer, speech recognitio...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{formatting}} the output of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for readability, while preserving wordlevel timing information of the transcript. Our system enriches the ASR transcript with punctuation, capitalization and properly written dates, times and other <b>numeric</b> <b>entities,</b> and our approach can be applied to other formatting tasks. The method we describe combines hand-crafted grammars with a class-based language model trained on written text and relies on Weighted Finite State Transducers (WF-STs) for the preservation of start and end time of each word...|$|R
5000|$|A pre-declared entity is a {{built-in}} notation convention for a character or a string. For example, in the HTML markup language, {{a large number}} of character and <b>numeric</b> <b>entities</b> are available to represent characters. In HTML, '<' is a possible pre-declared entity to represent '<'. The programmer must not declare this entity by himself before he can use it, since it is already pre-declared by the specifications of the HTML language. Pre-declared entities are often used as escape sequences to represent information that would otherwise cause possible conflicts in its non-encoded form.|$|R

50|$|Computer {{processing}} of cephalometric radiographs uses a digitizer. Digitization {{refers to the}} process of expressing analog information in a digital form. A digitizer is a computer input device which converts analog information into an electronic equivalent in the computer’s memory. In this treatise and its application to computerized cephalometrics, digitization refers to the resolving of headfilm landmarks into two <b>numeric</b> or digital <b>entities</b> - the X and Y coordinate. 3D analysis would have third quantity - Z coordinate.|$|R
40|$|Rigorous {{and proper}} linking of {{financial}} databases {{is a necessary}} step to test trading strategies incorporating multimodal sources of information. This paper proposes a machine learning solution to match companies in heterogeneous financial databases. Our method, named Financial Attribute Selection Distance (FASD), has two stages, each of them corresponding {{to one of the}} two interrelated tasks commonly involved in heterogeneous database matching problems: schema matching and entity matching. FASD's schema matching procedure is based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence of string and <b>numeric</b> attributes. FASD's <b>entity</b> matching solution relies on learning a company distance flexible enough to deal with the numeric and string attribute links found by the schema matching algorithm and incorporate different string matching approaches such as edit-based and token-based metrics. The parameters of the distance are optimized using the F-score as cost function. FASD is able to match the joint COMPUSTAT/CRSP and Institutional Brokers' Estimate System (I/B/E/S) databases with a F-score over 0. 94 using only a hundred of manually labeled company links.
