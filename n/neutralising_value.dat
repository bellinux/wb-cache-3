40|$|FarmLime (Low-cost lime for {{small-scale}} farming) is {{a multidisciplinary}} research project {{that aims to}} increase the food security of small-scale farmers by improving their access to agricultural lime which neutralises soil acidity and adds nutrients. This project focused on farming districts in northern Zambia that have highly acidic soils with poor crop yields. The aim was to locate suitable carbonate rocks in these farming districts and produce agricultural lime using a low cost method, eliminating the high transportation costs that farmers currently incur if they use lime. Perceptions The commonly held view is that small-scale farmers do not use agricultural lime because they don’t appreciate its benefits, it is expensive and difficult to obtain. A socio-economic survey carried out in Solwezi and Mkushi confirmed some of these views but indicated that farmers knew the benefits of using lime and that uptake of agricultural lime could be encouraged. The main constraints {{on the use of}} lime were the absence of soil testing and a lack of cash in the rural economy. Lime Resources Carbonate rocks occur throughout Zambia including those farming districts with highly acidic soils. A technical evaluation programme found that the dolomite from Solwezi and Mkushi is suitable for the production of agricultural lime. It has a <b>Neutralising</b> <b>Value</b> (NV) of 103 – 104...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{nutrient}} {{levels in}} inland waterways {{have led to}} algal blooms and eutrophication in many agricultural regions. To ensure fertiliser inputs are managed more effectively, the source of contamination needs to be tracked and identified. Point sources could include inorganic fertilisers, livestock excreta, or more recently biosolids. The presence of faecal indicator microorganisms has been widely used to identify the presence of faeces, however, these methods cannot distinguish between human and animals samples. This study investigated PCR amplification as a molecular method to distinguish biosolids from livestock faeces of biosolids, cattle, sheep, poultry and kangaroo. This was achieved using published priming sequences and restriction site profiling of amplified DNA across the 16 S rRNA gene of anaerobic gastrointestinal bacteria Bacteroides spp and Bifidobacteria spp. Preliminary investigation showed that of the three Bacteroides spp primer pairs investigated, two were useful for cow faecal material; though at lower annealing temperatures were also applicable to biosolids and sheep faecal material. The third primer pair was specific only for biosolids. All three primer pairs were unable to PCR-amplify Bacteroides spp sequences in faecal material of kangaroo. Of the three Bifidobacteria spp primer pairs, one was useful for sheep faecal material; though at lower annealing temperature was also applicable to biosolids and cow and kangaroo faecal material. The Bifidobacterium angulatum specific primer pair enabled the PCR detection of anaerobes only in biosolids and faecal material of kangaroo. The third, a Bifidobacterium catenulatum specific primer pair was suitable for faecal material of cow and at lower annealing temperatures was also applicable to the sample from sheep. Varying degrees of success were observed in faecal material from other animals. Generally, biosolids tested positive for Bacteroides and Bfidobacteria with all primers except for those specific for B. angulatum. For some primer sets, PCR amplification alone could not differentiate biosolids from other faecal samples. The serial dilution of water contaminated by a range of livestock excreta and biosolids is being examined further to enable the sensitivity of this method to be applied in the field. Soil acidification is an increasing problem throughout many agricultural regions in Australia typically on lighter-textured soils that have a low buffering capacity to changes in soil pH and/or that may be naturally acidic. Crops and pastures grown on acidic soils are subject to problems such as aluminium toxicity (particularly in the subsoil), nodulation failure in legumes and a reduced availability of some nutrients. Lime and dolomite are products that are commonly applied to neutralise soil acidity and improve plant productivity with application rates often determined by their <b>neutralising</b> <b>value</b> and particle size of the product, and the pH buffering capacity (lime requirement) of the soil. To investigate the effect of lime amended biosolids (LAB) as a product for neutralising soil acidity and for improving crop growth, four rates of LAB (0, 5, 10 and 15 t DS/ha) and four equivalent rates of lime product (0, 2. 3, 4. 6 and 6. 7 t/ha) were applied to an acidic red/brown sandy loam in the central wheatbelt of Western Australia. In addition, one rate of dewatered biosolids cake (DBC) at 7 t DS/ha was included to enable comparison {{to be made to}} this product. The experiment was conducted over three years and sown to wheat (Triticum aestivum), canola (Brassica napus) and then wheat in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Plants were sampled at 8 weeks and at harvest to determine the effect of LAB, lime and DBC on crop growth, nutrient uptake and grain yield. Samples of surface soil (0 - 10 cm) were collected and analysed at harvest for pH and major nutrients. Soil pH increased significantly with increasing rates of LAB or lime {{at the end of the}} first year, with similar values recorded between equivalent values of lime product. There was no significant change in soil pH following the addition of the DBC treatment. No further changes in soil pH had occurred by the end of the second year. The growth of both wheat and canola in the first two years was affected to a greater extent by nutrients (typically nitrogen) in the LAB than by the reduction in soil acidity. Measurements on wheat yield in the third year of the experiment and changes in soil pH in the surface (0 - 10 cm) and subsoil (10 - 20 cm) will provide further information as to the long term effects of LAB in agriculture and allow recommendations to be made regarding best practise land application rates...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new data}} on the chemical composition of precipitation in a selected area of the southern Apennines of Italy; these data are used to assess natural and anthropogenic contributions to the precipitation. The city of Potenza {{was used as a}} representative urban site, and the major and minor element (Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, NH 4 +,Cl–, NO 3 –, SO 42 – and Li+, F-, Br-, PO 43 -) and trace element (Zn, Fe, Al, Sr, Mn, Ba, Cu, Cr, V, As, Pb, Ni and Cd) concentrations of bulk precipitation from three different sampling sites within the study area were determined between June 2011 and May 2012. The majority of the collected rainwater has pH values higher than 5. 6. The composition of this rainwater was dominated by Ca 2 + the element with the highest volume-weighted mean concentration (VWA), followed by Na+, Cl–, Mg 2 +, NH 4 +, SO 42 –, NO 3 – and K+. The VWA of the trace metals decreased in the order Zn>Fe>Al>Sr>Mn>Ba>Cu>As>Pb. <b>Neutralising</b> factor (NFXi) <b>values</b> indicate that Ca 2 + is the dominant neutralising cation within this rainwater, with lower contribution from Mg 2 + and NH 4 +. The precipitation analysed during this study has a negligible marine influence as determined using Cl–concentrations as a proxy for the abundance of sea salts. Precipitation Fi values (marine fraction of element i) indicate that Na+ is the element with the highest seawater component, and we found partial marine contributions for the SO 42 –and Mg 2 + concentrations within this rainwater. Enrichment factors (EF) of selected elements were calculated to identify the sources of non-crustal elements: K+, Mg 2 +, Fe, and Ca 2 + are the only elements dominantly sourced from the crust, whereas Mn, Sr and Ba have highly variable EF values (10 – 100) suggesting that a small proportion of these elements was derived from anthropogenic sources in addition to a more significant crustal contribution. Cu, Pb, Zn, and As, elements that are commonly derived from anthropogenic sources, are highly enriched with respect to average crustal compositions, confirming that the concentrations of these elements within precipitation are significantly controlled by human activities...|$|R
40|$|Acidification {{of surface}} waters has been {{recognised}} {{as the major}} water quality problem in the UK uplands. The adverse effects of conifer afforestation on streamwater chemistry and ecology are well documented in acid-sensitive catchments and have mainly been attributed to the enhanced deposition of atmospheric pollutants onto conifer canopies (the “scavenging effect”). Currently, international and national policies promote the expansion of native broadleaf woodland in the UK. Pollutant deposition onto broadleaf canopies is considered less than onto the more aerodynamically rough conifers, but there is concern that largescale broadleaf planting could delay the recovery of acidified waters or lead to further acidification in most sensitive areas. However, there has been limited investigation {{of the influence of}} broadleaf woodland cover on streamwater chemistry in the UK. To investigate the effect of woodland cover 14 catchments with different (0 - 78 %) percentages of broadleaf woodland cover were identified in representative acidsensitive areas in north-western and central Scotland (Glen Arnisdale and Loch Katrine area) and northern and south-western England (Ullswater area and Devon) using spatial datasets in a GIS. Streamwater was sampled at high flow from the catchment outlets in winter and spring 2005 and 2006 and was analysed for major cations, anions and trace metals using standard methods. The number of samples ranged from two in the Glen Arnisdale catchments to 10 in the Loch Katrine area catchments which were sampled more intensively. Significant positive correlations were found between percentage broadleaf woodland cover and streamwater NO 3 (rs = 0. 51) and soluble Al (rs = 0. 64) concentrations. The greater NO 3 leaching to streamwater in the three most forested catchments (> 50 %) was probably due to enhanced N deposition onto woodland canopies and nitrification by alder in the Ullswater area forested catchments. Streamwater NO 3 concentrations equalled or exceeded non-marine SO 4 in the above catchments indicating that NO 3 was the principal excess acidifying ion in catchments with greater woodland cover. The woodland effect on streamwater chemistry in the study catchments was masked to some extent by variability in acid deposition climate and soil type composition. Seasalt inputs were found to be a more important control than woodland cover for streamwater chemistry in the maritime Glen Arnisdale catchments. A risk assessment of acid-sensitivity in the study catchments was conducted by calculating streamwater critical load exceedances using the Steady-State Water Chemistry (SSWC) and First-order Acidity Balance (FAB) models and modelled pollutant deposition for 1995 - 97 and 2002. Critical loads were exceeded by 0. 01 to 1. 74 keq H ha- 1 yr- 1 in two catchments which had woodland covers > 50 % and in the Devon control catchment. The remaining 11 study catchments were assessed to be not at risk of acidification, probably due to significantly reduced non-marine S deposition from 1986 to 2001, but seasalt inputs to the Glen Arnisdale catchments might cause acidic streamwater episodes. Acid-sensitivity was also assessed using macroinvertebrates sampled in 11 of the study catchments and the results generally agreed with the critical load assessments. More detailed estimates of the enhancement of dry S and N deposition onto birchwoods in the Loch Katrine area catchments using calculated roughness length within FRAME showed that it posed no risk for streamwater acidification in these catchments because of the high rainfall environment. However, in acid-sensitive areas of the UK with lower rainfall and closer to major pollution sources, enhanced pollutant scavenging by broadleaf woodland canopies could pose a greater risk of acidification to freshwaters. The finding that almost all study catchments with woodland covers less than 30 % are well protected from acidification suggests that this is a sensible threshold value for use in risk assessments of the effects of broadleaf woodland planting conducted within the Forests and Water Guidelines. The results of a sensitivity analysis of the Guidelines’ methodology, conducted using parameters such as numbers and timing of streamwater sampling, different runoff estimates and critical acid <b>neutralising</b> capacity <b>values,</b> showed that the Guidelines should be able to protect sensitive freshwaters from acidification in areas where broadleaf woodland is expanding.
