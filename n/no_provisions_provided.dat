Prisoners' rights {{groups such as}} the Equal Justice Initiative based in Montgomery, Alabama, have worked to fill the need. They have gained the exoneration of {{numerous}} innocent men on death row and prevented the deaths of others whose cases were considered worthy of resentencing.|$|R
50|$|There was <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> of <b>providing</b> {{assistance}} to Sanskrit Institutions during that time. Each Institution {{would then be}} getting a maximum of Rs. 1000/- as assistance per annum from Delhi Government. With Dr. Mishra's noble effort, Delhi administration decided to extend 95% {{assistance to}} all the Sanskrit Institutions. As a result of which, each Sanskrit Institution today is getting lakhs of rupees as assistance from Government. Dr. Mishra took with himself the confidence of all the institutions simultaneously along with him.|$|R

To perform their job well, the appointed scholars were forced to hire able men, muliao, to staff the mufu, to deal with flood, rebellion, finance and foreign affair. The mufu system was the well-oil machine that produced next generation high officials.|$|R

Ireland remains {{the only country in}} the EU and one of the only countries in the Council of Europe area to not have such legislation.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} in Section  2, to date, all buffer management schemes are mostly targeted at flooding protocols. This is logical that under flooding-based protocols, congestion occurs {{more frequently than}} quota-based protocols. However, under flooding protocols, if a bundle is dropped, {{there is still a}} high probability for the bundle to reach its destination. On the other hand, in quota protocols, as each bundle has finite copies, once a replica is dropped, the delivery probability of the corresponding bundle reduces. In other words, <b>no</b> <b>provisions</b> are <b>provided</b> to replace a dropped replica in order to maintain a high delivery ratio [14]. In the worst-case scenario, source nodes may remove all replicas/copies of a bundle.|$|R

The research for this article has led to an ultimate conclusion that ARPA does not provide federal agencies with the power to limit the scope of scientific study on covered archaeological materials. <b>No</b> <b>provision</b> of ARPA <b>provides</b> federal agencies with the authority to act as scientific dictators with ARPA-covered archaeological materials...|$|R
50|$|A sunset {{provision}} may {{be inserted}} into a prenuptial agreement, specifying {{that after a}} certain amount of time, the agreement will expire. In a few states, such as Maine, the agreement will automatically lapse after the birth of a child, unless the parties renew the agreement. In other states, a certain number of years of marriage will cause a prenuptial agreement to lapse. In states that have adopted the UPAA (Uniform Premarital Agreement Act), <b>no</b> sunset <b>provision</b> is <b>provided</b> by statute, but one could be privately contracted for. Note that states have different versions of the UPAA.|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of peer-to-peer (P 2 P) file sharing protocols {{is due to}} their efficient and scalable methods for data dissemination to numerous users. But many of these networks have <b>no</b> <b>provisions</b> to <b>provide</b> users with long term access to files after the initial interest has diminished, nor are they able to guarantee protection for users from malicious clients that wish to implicate them in incriminating activities. As such, users may turn to supplementary measures for storing and transferring data in P 2 P systems. We present a new file sharing paradigm, called a Graffiti Network, which allows peers to harness the potentially unlimited storage of the Internet as a third-party intermediary. Our key contributions in this paper are (1) an overview of a distributed system based on this new threat model and (2) a measurement of its viability through a one-year deployment study using a popular web-publishing platform. The results of this experiment motivate {{a discussion about the}} challenges of mitigating this type of file sharing in a hostile network environment and how web site operators can protect their resources...|$|R

"there is <b>no</b> express {{statutory}} <b>provision</b> <b>providing</b> for {{the manner}} of allocating coal blocks, it is done through a mechanism of Inter-Ministerial Group called the Screening Committee ... The Screening Committee had been constituted by means of administrative guidelines. Since, under the current dispensation, the allocation of coal blocks is purely administrative in nature, {{it was felt that}} the process of auction through competitive bidding can also be done through such administrative arrangements. In fact, this is the basis of our earlier legal advice. This according to the administrative Ministry has been questioned from time to time for legal sanction. If provision is made for competitive bidding in the Act itself or by virtue of rules framed under the Act the bidding process would definitely placed on a higher level of legal footing." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the I/O {{bandwidth}} of the ISA bus {{was becoming a}} critical bottleneck to PC graphics performance. The need for faster graphics was being driven by increasing adoption of graphical user interfaces in PC operating systems. While IBM's attempt at producing a successor to ISA with the Micro Channel Architecture was a technically viable option, it failed in the market due to its proprietary nature and imposition of licensing fees. The competing EISA open standard was still unable to offer enough performance improvement over ISA to provide a solution. Thus for a short time, hardware producers created proprietary implementations of local buses on their motherboards to give graphics cards {{direct access to the}} processor and system memory and avoid the limitations of the ISA bus. However, as these manufacturer-specific solutions were not standardized, there were <b>no</b> <b>provisions</b> for <b>providing</b> interoperability between them. This led to the VESA consortium proposing and defining a Local Bus standard in 1992. Additionally while greater graphics card performance was a primary goal of VLB, other devices could also benefit from the VLB standard; notably many mass storage controllers were offered for VLB with increased hard disk performance.|$|R
6000|$|As {{the carcass}} invites the vulture, this {{prostrate}} land drew adventurers from all {{points of the}} compass. Many, I am sorry to say, were {{in the service of}} the United States Government. Truth to tell, the special agents of the Treasury were themselves, as a body, not altogether spotless. I could name some of them, and some of their assistants, who made large fortunes by their opportunities. The special agents were allowed one-fourth of the value of the confiscated cotton for expenses of collection--none too much, considering the arduous and perilous character of the service; but the plan opened up such possibilities of fraud as have seldom been accorded by any system of conducting the public business, and never without disastrous results to official morality. Against bribery <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> could have <b>provided</b> an adequate safeguard; the magnitude of the interests involved was too great, the administration of the trust too loose and irresponsible. The system as it was, hastily devised in the storm and stress of a closing war, broke down in the end, and it is doubtful if the Government might not more profitably have let the [...] "captured and abandoned property" [...] alone.|$|R
40|$|Much {{specialist}} {{palliative care}} in the U. K. is provided through the voluntary sector, with funding {{in part from the}} National Health Service and the remainder from donations. Service development has been ad hoc to date. In Wales, with a population of just under three million, the Minister has allocated specific ring fenced funding for the voluntary sector, to ensure that there is equity of evidence-based care provision. To do this, a formula has been developed to meet the specialist palliative care needs across Wales, appropriate to both urban and rural settings, for populations of all ages and {{to take into account the}} requirements for hospital support teams and those working in cancer centers. In addition, where hospice inpatient beds exist, a funding formula has been developed to guide reimbursement for basic care costs. Where there are <b>no</b> beds, hospice-at-home <b>provision</b> <b>provides</b> an alternative model of care, with funding adjusted pro rata. The formula aims to ensure fairness of specialist palliative care provision, available out of hours as well as during the working day, providing patient-focused evidence-based care. This means that the specialist team must meet specialist education standards, act as a resource to generalist teams and use a core clinical data set to allow comparable audits against agreed all-Wales standards...|$|R
5000|$|The Investigation {{therefore}} expressed its {{concern that}} [...] "the regulatory {{authority of the}} State of the Operator did not identify the Operator’s shortcomings, thereby contributing {{to the cause of}} the accident." [...] It noted that, since the UK and Irish regulators were expressly prohibited by Regulation (EC) 1008/2008 from exercising any regulatory function in respect of the operation of aircraft from other Member States within and between their territories, both were obliged to rely on the oversight of Spain [...] "to ensure compliance in regulatory matters". It was concluded that in practice [...] "the evidence shows that such oversight was of limited scope and low effectiveness."In this situation, the only [...] "control" [...] on safety standards was observed to have been the SAFA programme of ramp checks which in this case had not identified the extent of systemic shortcomings. However, it was accepted by the Investigation that [...] "SAFA inspections are limited ….in what can be achieved in the protection of the aviation system".It was also noted that AESA oversight of the Operation required by Regulation (EC) 1008/2008 required that Member State issuing an AOC must also take responsibility for the corresponding Operating Licence. It was concluded that [...] "there was no evidence of any such oversight (of the Operation [...] ) being conducted by Spain", although noted that [...] "the Regulation makes <b>no</b> <b>provision</b> nor <b>provides</b> procedures of how oversight should be conducted, in particular where operations are carried out from a base outside a Member State" [...] (in this case the Isle of Man).Finally, the Investigation noted the involvement of the EU Air Safety Committee in relation to the Accident Operator in the months following the investigated accident and considered that the scope of its remit might usefully be widened [...] "as part of the EU aviation safety net".|$|R
