When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast, Belle offers him her own freedom in exchange for her father's, and eventually learns to love the Beast despite his unsightly outward appearance.|$|E
5|$|Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, {{was one of}} Elizabeth's leading statesmen, {{involved}} in domestic as well as foreign politics alongside William Cecil and Francis Walsingham. Although he refused {{to be married to}} Mary, Queen of Scots, Dudley was for a long time relatively sympathetic to her until, from the mid-1580s, he strongly advocated for her execution. As patron of the Puritan movement, he supported <b>non-conforming</b> preachers but tried to mediate between them and the bishops of the Church of England. A champion also of the international Protestant cause, he led the English campaign in support of the Dutch Revolt (1585–87). His acceptance of the post of Governor-General of the United Provinces infuriated Queen Elizabeth. The expedition was a military and political failure, and it ruined the Earl financially. Leicester was engaged in many large-scale business ventures {{and was one of the}} main backers of Francis Drake and other explorers and privateers. During the Spanish Armada, the Earl was in overall command of the English land forces. In this function, he invited Queen Elizabeth to visit her troops at Tilbury. This was the last of many events he had organised over the years, the most spectacular being the festival at his seat Kenilworth Castle in 1575 on occasion of a three-week visit by the Queen. Dudley was a principal patron of the arts, literature, and the Elizabethan theatre.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} 3 -month {{follow-up}} prospective {{pragmatic study}} was to evaluate {{the implementation of a}} pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnostic strategy in clinical practice. One thousand and one hundred thirty-four consecutive in- and outpatients with clinically suspected PE were enrolled into a sequential diagnostic algorithm in which vascular medical unit plays a pivotal role in advising physicians and suggesting the most appropriate tests according to the diagnostic algorithm. In this observational study, patients that followed the proposed work-up were attributed to a so-called "conform group". Patients in whom diagnostic work-up was not according to protocol were attributed to a "non-conform group". Nine hundred and ninety-seven patients (87. 9 %) had a conform work-up, and 137 patients a <b>non-conform</b> work-up according to the proposed diagnostic algorithm. The <b>non-conform</b> work-up directly increased in relation to the age of the referred patients. PE was ruled out in 907 (80 %) patients of whom 787 (86. 8 %) were in the conform group. Of the 797 patients who did not receive anticoagulant drugs, follow-up was obtained in 792 (99. 4 %). Among these patients, the incidence of acute thromboembolic events during the 3 -month follow-up period was different in the group of patients that had a conform work-up (1 %, [95 % CI, 0. 5 - 2. 1 %]) from the <b>non-conform</b> group patients (4. 5 %, [95 % CI, 2 - 10. 2 %]. Therefore patients from the <b>non-conform</b> group have an independent increased risk to develop a thromboembolic event during the follow-up, adjusted odds ratio 3. 3 [1. 1 - 10, 95 % CI]. Therefore we demonstrated that a <b>non-conform</b> diagnostic management strategy is associated with a higher risk of thrombotic event occurrence...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of glenohumeral conformity on interface micromotions in a metal backed glenoid implant. A force controlled experiment was performed in which a metal backed glenoid component with various PE inlay radii was subjected to a simulated joint reaction force. Local interface micromotions, rim displacement and bone substitute deformation were measured using DVRT sensors. All measured variables were significantly larger (p< 0. 05) in the <b>non-conform</b> inlay with radial mismatch 6 mm, compared to the conform inlay. These findings are contrary to previous reports by other authors who found that a larger mismatch not only reduces interface micromotions but translational forces and bone strains as well. The reason for these contradicting findings is the fact that in the present study a force controlled experiment was performed as opposed to a displacement controlled experiment. A <b>non-conform</b> inlay allows for a larger humeral head translation in the inlay. This causes a larger resultant moment on the metal back that opens the bone-implant interface. It is concluded that as glenohumeral mismatch increases relative micromotions, rim displacements and bone deformations increase, reducing the chance of vital bone ingrowth to occur.

Furthermore, as more professional skaters use hip hop, reggae, or hard rock music accompaniment in their videos, many urban youths, hip-hop fans, reggae fans, and hard rock fans are also drawn to skateboarding, further diluting the sport's punk image.|$|E

Although theory supposes the production batch size to be equal to customer order, situation observed in real production systems is different. Production often protects itself against manufacturing process unreliability resulting in <b>non-conformed</b> parts with overproduction. To manage the production wisely, the process risk should be evaluated. High ratio of setup costs to unit production costs should be taken into consideration as well as potential risk of each operation. This paper describes a proposed way, coming from the idea of FMEA methodology, to assess the risk and calculate costs related to process unreliability. The result then supports the batch size definition...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} for modelling the fluid-structure interaction of flexible heart valves is proposed. Using a finite element method, a Lagrangian {{description of a}} non-linear solid and an Eulerian description of a fluid are coupled by a Lagrange multiplier. This multiplier allows the solid and fluid mesh to be <b>non-conform.</b> Solid displacements and fluid velocities are described well in such a fictitious domain approach. However, the accuracy of pressures and shear stresses {{in the vicinity of}} the solid are poor. Therefore an inexpensive mesh-adaptation algorithm is applied, which adapts the fluid mesh to the position of the solid mesh every time step. This minor adjustment of the fluid mesh makes it possible to sustain a physiological pressure gradient across a solid leaflet. Furthermore, shear stresses can be computed at both sides of the leaflet. The method is demonstrated for a 2 D example, however with a scope to 3 D modelling...|$|R
