40|$|Among current {{approaches}} for fatigue strength assessment, the effective <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> method is widely employed by practising engineers designing welded joints. This {{is particularly important}} in the situation where the nominal stress and structural stress cannot be easily quantified. In this paper, {{the applicability of the}} so called effective <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> approach on large-size T-joints in truss bridges is investigated through a comprehensive experimental programme supported by numerical analysis. A series of large-scale fatigue tests on prototype large-size T-joints with cope holes were conducted. These types of joints are normally used in fully welded truss bridges. Furthermore, a simple parametric study was conducted using finite element analysis to investigate the effect of plate thickness and cope-hole radius on effective <b>notch</b> <b>stress.</b> Comparison of the results with commonly used design guidance documents reveals that the effective <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> approach provides a conservative estimate of the fatigue strength of the specimens tested in this experimental programme...|$|E

40|$|Several fatigue {{failures}} are initiating {{from the}} root of non-penetrating welds, which are widely applied in several industrial sectors. The structural optimization and reduction of weld material increase the danger of root cracking. The fatigue assessment during design is mainly based on the nominal, structural hot-spot or <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> approach. These approaches are only partly applicable to weld roots, give rough estimates such as the nominal stress approach or over-conservative life estimation such as occasionally the <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> approach when keyhole notches are modelled. An alternative assessment is possible with the crack propagation approach assuming the non-welded root gap and a short crack at the weld toe as initial cracks. A new approach is the <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> intensity approach (N-SIF approach) which is able to assess the fatigue life of V-shaped notches at weld toes as well as crack-like notches at weld roots using the strain energy density around the notch. Both approaches are applied to different joints where toe and root failures are probable. The results are compared with a previous analysis using the <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> approach. Fatigue test results are also available for a comparison which allows to draw conclusions {{with respect to the}} approaches for an appropriate fatigue strength assessment...|$|E

40|$|A {{gas turbine}} disc has three {{critical}} regions for which lifing calculations are essential: the assembly holes or weld areas, the hub region, and the blade-disc attachment area. Typically, a firtree joint {{is used to}} attach the blades to the turbine disc instead of a dove-tail joint, which is commonly used for compressor discs. A firtree joint involves contact between two surfaces at more than one location which makes the joint more difficult to design. Large loads generated due to the centrifugal action of the disc and associated blades are distributed over multiple areas of contact within the joint. All of the contacts in a firtree joint are required to be engaged simultaneously when the blades are loaded. However, slight variations {{in the manufacture of}} these components can have an impact on this loading. It is observed that small changes in the geometric entities representing contact between the two bodies can result in variations in the stress distribution near contact edges and the notch regions. Even though manufacturing processes have advanced considerably in the last few decades, the variations in geometry due to these processes cannot be completely eliminated. Hence, it is necessary to design such components in the presence of uncertainties in order to minimise the variation observed in their performance. In this work, the variations in geometry due to the manufacturing processes used to produce firtree joints between a gas turbine blade and the disc are evaluated. These variations are represented in two different ways using measurement data of firtree joints obtained from a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) : (i) the variation for the pressure angle in the firtree joint is extracted from a simple curve fit and (ii) using the same measurement data, the unevenness of the pressure surfaces is represented using a Fourier series after filtering noise components. A parametric computer aided design (CAD) model which represents the manufacturing variability is implemented using Siemens NX. Non-smooth surfaces are also numerically generated by assuming the surface profile to be a random process. Two- and three-dimensional elastic stress analysis is carried out on the firtree joint using the finite element code, Abaqus and the variations observed in the <b>notch</b> <b>stresses</b> with changing pressure angle are extracted. A surrogate assisted multiobjective optimisation is performed on the firtree joint based on the robustness principles. Kriging based models are used to build a surrogate for <b>notch</b> <b>stresses</b> and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is implemented to perform a multiobjective optimisation in order to minimise the mean and standard deviation of the <b>notch</b> <b>stresses.</b> An iterative search algorithm that updates the Kriging models with equally spaced infill points from the predicted Pareto front is adopted. Finally, a new design of the firtree joint is obtained which has better performance with respect to the variation in the <b>notch</b> <b>stresses</b> due to manufacturing uncertainties...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> {{approach for}} fatigue design {{is limited to}} thick sheet structures and a fixed notch radius of 1 [*]mm. Concepts utilizing the effective <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> claim {{to account for the}} variation of the weld shape parameters, however, size effects are not taken into account. Therefore, an expansion of the <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> approach has been developed, which includes consideration of the geometrical and statistical size effect in order to extend the application to thin and thick sheet structures. It is also capable of evaluating highly localized three-dimensional stress concentrations at weld start and end points. To validate the quality of this approach, experimentally determined fatigue data for thin steel sheet specimens from the Institute of Material Mechanics, including weld start and end points, and data from the literature regarding conventional thick sheet components without weld start and end points were reevaluated.

40|$|Fatigue of welded {{structures}} {{is commonly}} assessed in three ways. These are the nominal stress-, the structural hot spot- and the effective <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> approach. As {{the applicability of}} the approaches differs, these differences have been discussed. The effective <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> approach has been validated for a cruciform fillet welded and fully penetration welded joint, according to DNV (2012). The same fillet welded joint was further investigated for varying weld sizes. The results show, that for a weld size half the length of the validation model, fatigue life was estimated to be 140 % longer than that of the nominal approach. Further investigations revealed that there is a nonlinear relation between effective <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> and weld sizes, while comparison of the <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> and nominal stress approaches indicate that a linear relation is to be expected. Two explanations have been discussed. Firstly, the size of the notch may be dependent on the weld size, caused by loading mode alternations of the notch. And secondly, the linear relation found may be caused by simplifications made for the nominal stress approach. Equations describing the relation between the two approaches have been proposed. Based on the established methodology for the cruciform joint, a second joint provided by Aker Solutions has been assessed for weld root fatigue. This joint is a knee plate located in a horizontal brace of a drilling vessel. The knee plate was analysed by means of a local finite element model subjected to a variable loading, which was defined from provided stress range exceedances diagrams for one boundary. For simplicity, the opposite boundary of the brace was fixed. All simplifications made, for both model and boundaries, have been discussed and concluded to be acceptable and conservative, based on comparison to weld toe fatigue. Weld root fatigue life was assessed by means of Miner summation, and compared to weld toe fatigue. Based on the proposed equations and the linear relation found between the nominal- and the <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> S-N curves, a weld size providing a longer fatigue life at the weld root, rather than that at the toe, was proposed. </p...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{conducted}} at Cargotec Sweden AB {{as a case study}} on the loader body of the HIAB XS 144 crane. The loader body is the innermost part in the cranes arm-system and its fatigue life is critical to the operational life of the whole crane. Welding is the main joining process in Cargotec’s cranes and are often a limiting factor when it comes to fatigue life. The weld joining the column to the loader body is carrying the whole crane moment. Previous testing has shown that this weld often limits the fatigue life of the loader body, it has thus been evaluated. Weld fatigue life is affected by a large amount of parameters. To pinpoint the parameters mainly affecting the weld fatigue life and to understand their influence, calculations have been organized using factorial design. The evaluation has been carried out using 3 D finite element calculations utilizing sub-modelling to calculate local stresses in the weld notches. Different parameters have been evaluated based on their influence on the local <b>notch</b> <b>stresses.</b> To estimate stresses from the evaluated parameters, regression equations have been fitted. The effective notch method has been used to estimate weld fatigue life. The evaluation has shown that a butt-weld design with root-support, only being welded from the outside of the loader body, as used on some other crane models, could not provide a robust design for the XS 144 crane. The evaluation could also point out several critical parameters that need to be considered when using such design.

The <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> intensity is introduced to characterize the singular stress 7 eld near the notch vertex of adhesive lap joints. The proposed scheme enables us to extract the intensity of each eigenfunction term from the far 7 eld data without resort to special singular elements at the vertex. It turns out that a weak stress singularity is not negligible around the vertex when it exists in addition to the major singularity. For a thin adhesive layer, there exist two asymptotic solutions: one is the inner solution approaching the eigenfunction solution for the vertex at which the adherend meets with the adhesive and the other is intermediate solution represented by the eigenfunction series that would be obtained {{in the absence of the}} adhesive layer.

Up to now various different radii (r= 1. 0 mm,r= 0. 3 mm and r= 0. 05 mm) are available for the assessment of thin, medium and thick welded sheets. In addition, effective stress approaches have been considered which rely also on the calculation of notch stresses.

Recently, due to the strategies for minimizing the fuel consumption and vehicle emissions, more and more applications of lightweight materials, such as aluminum (Al) alloys, are employed in spot-welded joints.

In this study, a new <b>notch</b> <b>stress</b> approach is developed for fatigue life evaluation of the spot-welded joint. The idea of this method originates from Rupp’s structural stress method, which has been successfully used in automotive industry.

40|$|Within the {{structural}} durability evaluation of welded structures under spectrum loading, {{the influence of}} overloads on the fatigue life due to special events during service must also be considered. For this, butt welds and transverse stiffeners manufactured from the steel grades S 355 N/M, 6900 and 9600 were submitted to Gaussian spectra without and with superimposed overload spectra. The overloads harmed only the low-strength joints under pulsating bending. In all the other cases investigated, with low-, medium- and high-strength steels under fully reversed and pulsating loadings, a significant decrease of fatigue life was not observed; on the contrary, a significant increase of fatigue life could even be observed. This behaviour is explained by modelling the <b>notch</b> <b>stresses</b> and strains in the weld toes with the appertaining cyclic elastic-plastic material law and considering the local residual stresses.

Fracture initiation in smooth specimens occurs in or at γ-grains and between the lamellas in lamellar colonies. In the notched specimens interlamellar initiation dominated...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In 1971, Firrao and Spretnak {{performed}} a large experimental campaign {{to assess the}} elastic-plastic stress concentration factor at fracture {{as a function of}} the elastic stress concentration factor and of the tempering temperature, by using 25. 4 mm wide, 1. 14 mm thick AISI 4340 quenched steel sheet tensile specimens with variable tip radius central notches. The availability of finite element methods allows now to re-examine those results and overcome the simplifying assumptions that were originally used to evaluate <b>notch</b> <b>stresses.</b> The elastic stress concentration factors are obtained by three-dimensional solutions, which also evidence the gradual evolution from plane-stress to plane-strain that occurs by decreasing the notch radius while keeping the thickness constant. Moreover, both the actual stress state and the stress concentration factor in the notch immediately before the failure are evaluated by elastic-plastic solutions. Finally, the original conclusions on the notch sensitivity of the examined steel are re-assessed and reinterprete...|$|R
