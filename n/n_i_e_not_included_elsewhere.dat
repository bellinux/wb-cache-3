40|$|International audienceWe {{conducted}} two (May 2002 and September 2003) pulse additions of 15 NH 4 + to {{the flood}} water inundating a tidal freshwater marsh fringing the nutrient-rich Scheldt River (Belgium) and traced {{the fate of}} ammonium in the intact ecosystem. Here we report in detail the 15 N uptake into the various marsh components (leaves, roots, sediment, leaf litter and invertebrate fauna), and the 15 N retention {{on a scale of}} 15 days. We particularly focus on the contributions of the rooted macrophytes and the microbial community in the sediment and on plant litter. Assimilation and short term retention of 15 NH 4 + was low on both occasions. Only 4 ? 9 % of the added 15 N trace was assimilated, corresponding to 13 ? 22 % and 8 ? 18 % of the processed 15 <b>N</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>not</b> exported as 15 NH 4 + in May and September, respectively. In May nitrogen assimilation rate (per hour inundated) was > 3 times faster than in September. Macrophytes (above- and below ground) were of limited importance for short term 15 N retention accounting for 15 NH 4 + processed by the marsh. The less dominant herbaceous species were more important (on an area basis) than the dominant reed (Phragmites australis). The microbial community colonizing the sediment and litter surfaces were responsible for most nitrogen assimilation and short-term retention in the marsh. The large reactive surface area available for microbial colonization together with direct plant uptake, are the crucial components for nitrogen assimilation, retention and transformation in nutrient-rich tidal freshwater marshes...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{constructing}} an optimal co-adapted coupling {{for a pair}} of symmetric random walks on Z_ 2 ^d was considered by Connor and Jacka (2008), and the existence of a coupling which is stochastically fastest in the class of all such co-adapted couplings was demonstrated. In this paper we show how to generalise this construction to an optimal co-adapted coupling for the continuous-time symmetric random walk on K_n^d, where K_n is the complete graph with n vertices. Moreover, we show that although this coupling is not maximal for any <b>n</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> it does <b>not</b> achieve equality in the coupling inequality), it does tend to a maximal coupling as n→∞.

40|$|A {{real-time}} {{list processing}} system {{is one in}} which the time required by each elementary list operation (CONS, CAR, CDR, RPLACA, RPLACD, EQ, and ATOM in LISP) is bounded by a (small) constant. Classical list processing systems such as LISP do not have this property because a call to CONS may invoke the garbage collector which requires time proportional to the number of accessible cells to finish. The space requirement of a classical LISP system with N accessible cells under equilibrium conditions is (1. 5 +μ) N or (1 +μ) N, depending upon whether a stack is required for the garbage collector, where μ> 0 is typically less than 2. A list processing system is presented which: 1) is real-time [...] <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> T(CONS) is bounded by a constant independent of the number of cells in use; 2) requires space (2 + 2 μ) <b>N,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>not</b> more than twice that of a classical system; 3) runs on a serial computer without a time-sharing clock; 4) handles directed cycles in the data structures; 5) is fast [...] the average time for each operation is about the same as with normal garbage collection; 6) compacts [...] minimizes the working set; 7) keeps the free pool in one contiguous block [...] objects of nonuniform size pose no problem; 8) uses one phase incremental collection [...] no separate mark, sweep, relocate phases; 9) requires no garbage collector stack; 10) requires no "mark bits", per se; 11) is simple [...] suitable for microcoded implementation. Extensions of the system to handle a user program stack, compact list representation ("CDR-coding"), arrays of non-uniform size, and hash linking are discussed. CDR-coding is shown to reduce memory requirements for N LISP cells to ≈(I+μ) N. Our system is also compared with another approach to the real-time storage management problem, reference counting, and reference counting is shown to be neither competitive with our system when speed of allocation is critical, nor compatible, in the sense that a system with both forms of garbage collection is worse than our pure one. Key Words and Phrases: real-time, compacting, garbage collection, list processing, virtual memory, file or database management, storage management, storage allocation, LISP, CDR-coding, reference counting.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{interference effects}} between p-wave resonance scattering amplitude and background s-wave amplitude in low-energy neutron scattering from a heavy nucleus which {{goes through the}} compound nucleus stage. The first effect is in {{the difference between the}} forward and backward scattering cross sections. Because of the chaotic nature of the compound states, this effect is a random variable with zero mean. However, a statistical consideration shows that the probability distribution of this effect does not obey the standard central limit theorem. That is, the probability density for the effect averaged over n resonances does not become a Gaussian distribution with the variance decreasing as 1 /sqrt(n) (``violation'' of the theorem!). We derive the probability distribution of the effect and the limit distribution of the average. It is found that the width of this distribution does not decrease with the increase of <b>n,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> fluctuations are <b>not</b> suppressed by averaging. Furthermore, we consider the correlation between the neutron spin and the scattering plane and find that this effect, although much smaller, shows fluctuations which actually increase upon averaging over many measurements. Limits of the effects due to finite resonance widths are also considered. In the appendix we present a simple derivation of the limit theorem for the average of random variables with infinite variances. Comment: 15 pages, RevTeX, submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{give rise}} to {{dramatically}} different diseases. Their interactions with the host, however, do share common characteristics: they are both human pathogens which do not survive in the environment and which colonize and invade mucosa at their port of entry. It is therefore likely that they have common properties {{that might not be}} found in nonpathogenic bacteria belonging to the same genetically related group, such as Neisseria lactamica. Their common properties may be determined by chromosomal regions found only in the pathogenic Neisseria species. To address this issue, we used a previously described technique (C. R. Tinsley and X. Nassif, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 : 11109 – 11114, 1996) to identify sequences of DNA specific for pathogenic neisseriae and not found in N. lactamica. Sequences present in N. lactamica were physically subtracted from the N. meningitidis Z 2491 sequence and also from the N. gonorrhoeae FA 1090 sequence. The clones obtained from each subtraction were tested by Southern blotting for their reactivity with the three species, and only those which reacted with both N. meningitidis and <b>N.</b> gonorrhoeae (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>not</b> specific to either one of the pathogens) were further investigated. In a first step, these clones were mapped onto the chromosomes of both N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. The majority of the clones were arranged in clusters extending up to 10 kb, suggesting the presence of chromosomal regions common to N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae which distinguish these pathogens from the commensal N. lactamica. The sequences surrounding these clones were determined from the N. meningitidis genome-sequencing project. Several clones corresponded to previously described factors required for colonization and survival at the port of entry, such as immunoglobulin A protease and PilC. Others were homologous to virulence-associated proteins in other bacteria, demonstrating that the subtractive clones are capable of pinpointing chromosomal regions shared by N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae which are involved in common aspects of the host interaction of both pathogens...|$|R

40|$|Wavelets {{have gained}} {{considerable}} popularity within the statistical arena {{in the context}} of nonparametric regression. When modeling data of the form y = f + ϵ, the objective is to estimate the unknown `true' function f with small risk, based on sampled data y contaminated with random (usually Gaussian) noise ϵ. Wavelet shrinkage and thresholding techniques have proved to be quite effective in recovering the true function f, particularly when f is spatially inhomogeneous. Recently, Johnstone and Silverman (2005 b) proposed using empirical Bayes methods for level-dependent threshold selection in wavelet shrinkage. Using the posterior median estimator, their approach amounts to a random thresholding procedure with impressive mean squared error (MSE) results. At each level, their approach considers a two-component mixture prior for each of the wavelet coefficients independently. This mixture prior inherently assumes that the wavelet coefficients are symmetrically distributed about zero. Depending on the choice of wavelet filter and the interesting attributes of the true function, it may be the case that neither the magnitude nor the number of positive coefficients are equal to the those of the negative coefficients. Inspired by the work of Zhang (2005) and Zhang et al. (2007), this thesis introduces a random generalized thresholding procedure in the wavelet domain that does not require the symmetry assumption; it uses a three-component mixture prior that handles the positive and negative coefficients separately. It is demonstrated that the proposed generalized wavelet thresholding procedure performs quite well when estimating f from a single sampled realization y. As in Johnstone and Silverman (2005 b), the performance of the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) is substantially better than that of the standard Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) in terms of MSE and visual quality. An additional advantage for MODWT is that it is well-defined for any number of sampled points <b>N,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>N</b> need <b>not</b> be a power of two. The proposed procedure also performs well when estimating f from multiple noisy realizations y_i, i = 1, [...] .,n. In most, if not all, of the shrinkage and generalized shrinkage techniques considered, the noise standard deviation is assumed to be known and constant across the length of the function. In reality, it is typically not known and must be estimated. In the single realization setting, the estimate is usually taken to be a constant based on the median absolute deviation of the empirical wavelet coefficients at the finest decomposition level. With multiple realizations, there are more estimation options available. Various estimation options for a constant variance are examined via simulation. The results indicate that three of the six estimates considered are reasonable choices. The case of heterogeneous variances across the length of the function is also briefly explored via simulation. Finally, an inferential procedure is proposed that first removes noise from individual observations via the generalized wavelet thresholding procedure, and then uses newly proposed F-like statistics (Cui et al., 2005; Hwang and Liu, 2006; Zhou, 2007) to compare populations of sampled observations. To demonstrate its applicability, the aforementioned statistical work is applied to datasets generated from Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) experiments...|$|R
