Tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a <b>negative</b> <b>regulator</b> of PI3K signaling.

25|$|The E2 protein {{serves as}} a master {{transcriptional}} regulator for viral promoters located primarily in the long control region. The protein has a transactivation domain linked by a relatively unstructured hinge region to a well-characterized DNA binding domain. E2 facilitates the binding of E1 to the viral origin of replication. E2 also utilizes a cellular protein known as Bromodomain-4 (Brd4) to tether the viral genome to cellular chromosomes. This tethering to the cell's nuclear matrix ensures faithful distribution of viral genomes to each daughter cell after cell division. It is thought that E2 {{serves as a}} <b>negative</b> <b>regulator</b> of expression for the oncogenes E6 and E7 in latently HPV-infected basal layer keratinocytes. Genetic changes, such as integration of the viral DNA into a host cell chromosome, that inactivate E2 expression tend to increase {{the expression of the}} E6 and E7 oncogenes, resulting in cellular transformation and possibly further genetic destabilization.|$|E

Beta catenin abundance and transcriptional activity are significantly regulated by several factors. Though {{it is well known that}} Akt and Gsk 3 beta are respective positive and <b>negative</b> <b>regulators</b> of beta catenin, however, no single study has so far documented how the expression and activity of both positive as well as <b>negative</b> <b>regulators</b> play favorable role on beta catenin expression and activity in NSCLC. In this study, we compared expression and activity of beta catenin and its regulators in normal lung cell WI 38 and NSCLC cell A 549 by western blot, qRT-PCR and luciferase assay. We observed that beta catenin positive regulators (Akt and Hsp 90) and <b>negative</b> <b>regulators</b> (Gsk 3 beta and microRNA- 214) have differential expression and/or activity in NSCLC cell A 549. However the differentially altered statuses of both the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>regulators</b> rendered cumulative positive effect on beta catenin expression and activity in A 549. Our study thus suggests that chemotherapeutic modulations of regulating factors are crucial when abrogation and/or inhibition of key oncogenic proteins are necessary for cancer chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe role of cell {{size and}} shape in {{controlling}} local intracellular signaling reactions, and how this spatial information originates and is propagated, is not well understood. We have used partial differential equations to model the flow of spatial information from the β-adrenergic receptor to MAPK 1, 2 through the cAMP/PKA/B-Raf/MAPK 1, 2 network in neurons using real geometries. The numerical simulations indicated that cell shape controls the dynamics of local biochemical activity of signal-modulated <b>negative</b> <b>regulators,</b> such as phosphodiesterases and protein phosphatases within regulatory loops to determine the size of microdomains of activated signaling components. The model prediction that <b>negative</b> <b>regulators</b> control the flow of spatial information to downstream components was verified experimentally in rat hippocampal slices.

2500|$|As stated above, {{sulfatide}} {{is predominantly}} {{found in the}} oligodendrocytes and the Schwann cells in the nervous system. When oligodendrocytes are differentiating, sulfatide is first evident in immature oligodendrocytes. [...] However, research suggests that sulfatide has a greater role than simply being a structural component of the membrane. This is because sulfatide is upregulated, i.e.there {{is an increase in}} sulfatide, prior to the myelin sheath being wrapped around the axon, and experiments in cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) deficient mice have shown that sulfatide operates as a <b>negative</b> <b>regulator</b> (inhibitor) of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Accordingly, further research has demonstrated that when sulfatide is deficient, there is a two to threefold increase in oligodendrocyte differentiation, evidence providing support that sulfatide operates as a <b>negative</b> <b>regulator</b> or inhibitor of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Myelination also appears to be stimulated by sulfatide in the Schwann Cells. Such stimulation is thought to occur through the following interactions. First, sulfatide binds to tenascin-R or laminin in the extracellular matrix, which goes on to bind signaling molecules such as F3 and integrins in the glial membrane. This causes signaling through c-src/fyn kinase. Specifically, the laminin α6β1-integrin forms a complex with fyn kinase and focal adhesion kinase that enables signaling, which, in turn, causes myelination to begin. Sulfatide binding to laminin also causes c-src/fyn kinase activation and initiation of basement membrane formation.|$|E

The reaction occurs with {{the transfer of}} a hydride ion from Glu's Cα to NAD(P)+, thereby forming 2-iminoglutarate, which is hydrolyzed to 2-oxoglutarate and NH4+. The reaction's equilibrium under standard circumstances greatly favors Glu formation over NH4+ (Go' ~ 30 kJ.mol-1) formation. For this reason, {{it was thought that}} the enzyme {{played an important role in}} ammonia detoxification, because since high [...] are toxic, this equilibrium position would be physiologically important; it would help to maintain low [...] However, in individuals with a certain form of hyperammonemia resulting from a form of hyperinsulinism, the enzyme's activity is increased due to decreased GTP sensitivy, a <b>negative</b> <b>regulator.</b> These individual's blood ammonia levels are raised significantly, which would not be expected if the enzyme did indeed operate at equilibrium.|$|E

40|$|Regulation of {{irreversible}} cell lineage commitment {{depends on}} a delicate balance between positive and <b>negative</b> <b>regulators,</b> which comprise a sophisticated network of transcription factors. Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) stimulates the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts through the induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells c 1 (NFATc 1), the essential transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis. Osteoclast-specific robust induction of NFATc 1 is achieved through an autoamplification mechanism, in which NFATc 1 is constantly activated by calcium signaling while the <b>negative</b> <b>regulators</b> of NFATc 1 are suppressed. However, it has been unclear how such <b>negative</b> <b>regulators</b> are repressed during osteoclastogenesis. Here we show that B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein- 1 (Blimp 1; encoded by Prdm 1), which is induced by RANKL through NFATc 1 during osteoclastogenesis, functions as a transcriptional repressor of anti-osteoclastogenic genes such as Irf 8 and Mafb. Overexpression of Blimp 1 leads {{to an increase in}} osteoclast formation, and Prdm 1 -deficient osteoclast precursor cells do not undergo osteoclast differentiation efficiently. The importance of Blimp 1 in bone homeostasis is underscored by the observation that mice with an osteoclast-specific deficiency in the Prdm 1 gene exhibit a high bone mass phenotype caused by a decreased number of osteoclasts. Thus, NFATc 1 choreographs the determination of cell fate in the osteoclast lineage by inducing the repression of <b>negative</b> <b>regulators</b> as well as through its effect on positive regulators...|$|R

2500|$|Hematopoiesis {{is defined}} as the {{formation}} and development of blood cells, all of which are derived from hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). [...] HSPCs are primitive cells capable of self-renewal and initially differentiate into common myeloid progenitor (CMP) or common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells. [...] CMPs represent the cellular population that has become myeloid lineage and it is the point that myelopoeisis begins. [...] During myelopoeisis further cellular differentiation takes place including thrombopoiesis, erythropoeisis, granulopoeisis, and [...] monocytopoeisis. [...] CLPs subsequently differentiate into B-cells and T-cells in a process designated lymphopoiesis. [...] Given that miR-155-5p is expressed in hematopoietic cells it was hypothesized that this miRNA plays a critical role in these cellular differentiation processes. [...] In support of this premise, miR-155-5p was found to be expressed in CD34(+) human HSPCs, and it was speculated that this miRNA may hold these cells at an early stem-progenitor stage, inhibiting their differentiation into a more mature cell (i.e. megakaryocytic/erythroid/granulocytic/monocytic/B-lymphoid/T-lymphoid). [...] This hypothesis was substantiated when pre-mir-155 transduced HSPCs generated 5-fold fewer myeloid and 3-fold fewer erythroid colonies. [...] Additionally, Hu et al. demonstrated that the homeobox protein, HOXA9, regulated MIR155HG expression in myeloid cells and that this miRNA played a functional role in hematopoiesis. [...] These investigators found that forced expression of miR-155-5p in bone marrow cells resulted in a ~50% decrease in SPI1 (i.e. PU.1), a transcription factor and a regulator of myelopoiesis, and a validated target of this miRNA. [...] It was also established that in vitro differentiation of purified human erythroid progenitor cells resulted in a progressive decrease of miR-155-5p expression in mature red cells. [...] Additionally, mice deficient in pre-mir-155 showed clear defects in lymphocyte development and generation of B- and T-cell responses in vivo. [...] Finally, it was established that regulatory T-cell (Tregs) development required miR-155-5p and this miRNA was shown {{to play a role in}} Treg homeostasis and overall survival by directly targeting SOCS1, a <b>negative</b> <b>regulator</b> for IL-2 signaling. [...] Taken together, these results strongly suggest that miR-155-5p is an essential molecule in the control of several aspects of hematopoiesis including myelopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and lymphopoiesis.|$|E

Normally, to moderate RTK signalling, induction of Sprouty (SPRY) and Sprouty-related (SPRED) antagonists occurs.

Therefore, we hypothesise that due {{to the need for}} tight regulation of RTK signalling, SPRY and SPRED <b>negative</b> <b>regulators</b> provide a degree of redundancy which ensures that a suppression of one or more family member does not lead to disease. Contrary to this, our analyses of prostates from 24 -week-old Spry 1 - or Spry 2 -deficientmice, either hemizygous (+/−) or homozygous (−/−) for the null allele, revealed a significantly greater incidence of PIN compared to wild-type littermates.

Endotoxin tolerization suppressed LPS-inducible TLR 4 -TRIF and TRIF-TANK binding kinase (TBK) 1 associations, induction of TBK 1 kinase activity, activation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF) - 3, and expression of RANTES and IFN-beta. Tolerance-mediated dysregulation of the TLR 4 -TRIF-TBK 1 signaling module was accompanied by increased levels of suppressor of IkappaB kinase-epsilon (SIKE) and sterile alpha and Armadillo motif-containing molecule (SARM). LPS-tolerant cells showed increased expression of <b>negative</b> <b>regulators</b> Toll-interacting protein (Tollip), suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) - 1, IL- 1 R-associated kinase-M, and SHIP- 1, which correlated with reduced p 38 phosphorylation, IkappaB-alpha degradation, and inhibited expression of TNF-alpha, IL- 6, and IL- 8. To examine functional consequences of increased expression of Tollip in LPS-tolerized cells, we overexpressed Tollip in 293 /TLR 4 /MD- 2 transfectants and observed blunted LPS-inducible activation of NF-kappaB and RANTES, while TNF-alpha responses were not affected.

30|$|Using {{available}} information on disease resistance in rice (Vergne et al. 2008), {{we found that}} region defining NIS 1 contains several categories of genes that could participate in disease resistance (Figure  4 A): NBS-LRR and WAK genes {{that are involved in}} pathogen recognition, MAPK genes and Rack 1 involved in signal transduction and WRKY genes involved in transcriptional regulation of defense ((Delteil et al. 2010) and references herein). As discussed above, the heritability of NIS 1 suggests that NBS-LRR genes are unlikely involved.

On the opposite, these genes could be responsible for the NIS 1 phenotype if they encode for <b>negative</b> <b>regulators</b> of disease resistance and if high nitrogen increases their activity.
