5|$|The {{intuitive}} {{notion that}} each <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> {{can be obtained}} by applying successor sufficiently often to zero requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the axiom of induction.|$|E
5|$|If gcd(a,b)=1, then a and b {{are said}} to be coprime (or {{relatively}} prime). This property does not imply that a or b are themselves prime numbers. For example, neither 6 nor 35 is a prime number, since they both have two prime factors: 6=2×3 and 35=5×7. Nevertheless, 6 and 35 are coprime. No <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> other than 1 divides both 6 and 35, since they have no prime factors in common.|$|E
5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} calculates {{the greatest}} common divisor (GCD) of two natural numbers a and b. The {{greatest common divisor}} g is the largest <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. Synonyms for the GCD include the greatest common factor (GCF), the highest common factor (HCF), the highest common divisor (HCD), and the greatest common measure (GCM). The greatest common divisor is often written as gcd(a,b) or, more simply, as (a,b), although the latter notation is also used for other mathematical concepts, such as two-dimensional vectors.|$|E
25|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> form {{a subset}} of the integers. As there is no common {{standard}} for the inclusion or not of zero in the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers,</b> the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> without zero are commonly referred to as positive integers, and the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> with zero are referred to as non-negative integers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{cardinal}} numbers, and ordinal numbers, do {{not have}} additive inverses within their respective sets. Thus, for example, {{we can say that}} <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> do have additive inverses, but because these additive inverses are not themselves <b>natural</b> <b>numbers,</b> the set of <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> is not closed under taking additive inverses.|$|R
50|$|The <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> form {{a subset}} of the integers. As there is no common {{standard}} for the inclusion or not of zero in the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers,</b> the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> without zero are commonly referred to as positive integers, and the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> with zero are referred to as non-negative integers.|$|R
5|$|Then if V'i = V {{for each}} i, the {{resulting}} direct sum {{can be written}} in exponential notation as V⊕N, or simply VN {{with the understanding that}} the direct sum is the default. We can again replace the set N with a cardinal number n to get V'n, although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality n, this is defined only up to isomorphism. Taking V to be the field R of real numbers (thought of as a vector space over itself) and n to be some <b>natural</b> <b>number,</b> we get the vector space that is most commonly studied in linear algebra, the real vector space Rn.|$|E
25|$|Each <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> is then {{equal to}} the set {{containing}} just the <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> preceding it.|$|E
25|$|The {{theories}} with m a <b>natural</b> <b>number,</b> n a <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> or , and l = 0 or 1 (with l = 0 if n=0).|$|E
5000|$|When {{the index}} set is the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> , the {{function}} [...] is a sequence denoted by [...] A series indexed on the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> is an ordered formal sum {{and so we}} rewrite [...] as [...] in order to emphasize the ordering induced by the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers.</b> Thus, we obtain the common notation for a series indexed by the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Sets of <b>natural</b> <b>numbers,</b> of {{pairs of}} <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> (or even of n-tuples of <b>natural</b> <b>numbers)</b> that have Diophantine {{definitions}} are called Diophantine sets. In these terms, Hilbert's tenth problem asks {{whether a particular}} Diophantine set is non-empty.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the power}} {{set of the}} <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> (the set of all subsets of the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers)</b> ...|$|R
25|$|The number 0 is the {{smallest}} non-negative integer. The <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> following 0 is 1 and no <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> precedes 0. The number 0 {{may or may not}} be considered a <b>natural</b> <b>number,</b> but it is a whole number and hence a rational number and a real number (as well as an algebraic number and a complex number).|$|E
25|$|To count a {{group of}} objects means to assign a <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> to {{each one of the}} objects, {{as if it were a}} label for that object, such that a <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> is never {{assigned}} to an object unless its predecessor was already assigned to another object, with the exception that zero is not assigned to any object: the smallest <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> to be assigned is one, and the largest <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> assigned depends on the size of the group. It is called the count and it is equal to the number of objects in that group.|$|E
25|$|Axiom One: 0 is a <b>natural</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... where [...] is {{the set of}} all <b>natural</b> <b>numbers,</b> is the set of all even <b>natural</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> {{is that they are}} well-ordered: every non-empty set of <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> has a least element. The rank among well-ordered sets is expressed by an ordinal number; for the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers,</b> this is denoted as [...] (omega).|$|R
2500|$|Closure under {{addition}} and multiplication: for all <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> [...] and , both [...] and [...] are <b>natural</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Every <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> has a successor.|$|E
25|$|In words, {{the basis}} P(0) and the {{inductive}} step (namely, that the inductive hypothesis P(k) implies P(k+1)) together imply that P(n) for any <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> n. The axiom of induction {{asserts that the}} validity of inferring that P(n) holds for any <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> n from the basis and the inductive step.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} {{infinite}} descent {{was one of}} Pierre de Fermat's favorites. This method of proof can assume several slightly different forms. For example, it might begin by showing that if a statement is true for a <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> n {{it must also be}} true for some smaller <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> m (m < n). Using mathematical induction (implicitly) with the inductive hypothesis being that the statement is false for all natural numbers {{less than or equal to}} m, one may conclude that the statement cannot be true for any <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> n.|$|E
50|$|No {{explicit}} representation of <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> is given. However <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> may be constructed {{by applying the}} successor function to 0, and then applying other arithmetic functions. A distribution of <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> is implied by this, based on the complexity of constructing each number.|$|R
2500|$|... where [...] is {{the set of}} <b>natural</b> <b>numbers,</b> and so [...] is the set of ordered n-tuples of <b>natural</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Suppose that R( [...] y, x1, [...] [...] [...], xk [...] ) is a fixed k+1-ary {{relation}} on the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers.</b> The mu operator [...] "μy", {{in either the}} unbounded or bounded form, is a [...] "number theoretic function" [...] defined from the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> to the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers.</b> However, [...] "μy" [...] contains a predicate over the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> that delivers true when the predicate is satisfied and false when it is not.|$|R
25|$|Axiom Two: Every <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> has a successor.|$|E
25|$|For any <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> n, nnbsp&+nbsp&1 {{is greater}} thannbsp&n.|$|E
25|$|Whether n=0 or n=1 {{depends on}} the {{definition}} of the natural numbers. If 0 is considered a <b>natural</b> <b>number,</b> as is common in the fields of combinatorics and mathematical logic, the base case is given by n=0. If, on the other hand, 1 is taken as the first <b>natural</b> <b>number,</b> then the base case is given by n=1.|$|E
5000|$|... 25 {{is the sum}} of the single-digit odd <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9, {{the first}} five odd <b>natural</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Second-order {{arithmetic}} is {{a formal}} {{theory of the}} <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> and sets of <b>natural</b> <b>numbers.</b> Many mathematical objects, such as countable rings, groups, and fields, as well as points in effective Polish spaces, can be represented as sets of <b>natural</b> <b>numbers,</b> and modulo this representation can be studied in second-order arithmetic.|$|R
50|$|The {{infinite}} set I is a superset of the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers.</b> To {{show that}} the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> themselves constitute a set, the axiom schema of specification {{can be applied to}} remove unwanted elements, leaving the set N of all <b>natural</b> <b>numbers.</b> This set is unique by the axiom of extensionality.|$|R
25|$|Axiom Three: 0 {{is not the}} {{successor}} of any <b>natural</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
25|$|Every <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> {{is either}} zero, or nnbsp&+nbsp&1 for some natural numbernbsp&n.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{elements}} in each equivalence class is the <b>natural</b> <b>number</b> n.|$|E
25|$|The {{observation}} that the <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> are well ordered by the usual less-than relation is commonly called the well-ordering principle (for <b>natural</b> <b>numbers).</b>|$|R
50|$|Closure under {{addition}} and multiplication: for all <b>natural</b> <b>numbers</b> a and b, both a + b and a × b are <b>natural</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
