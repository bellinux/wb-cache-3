As such, <b>net.art</b> is more of a movement and a critical and political landmark in Internet art history, than a specific genre. Early precursors of the <b>net.art</b> movement include the international fluxus (Nam June Paik) and avant-pop (Mark Amerika) movements. The avant-pop movement particularly became widely recognized in Internet circles from 1993, largely via the popular Alt-X site.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Estuarine {{residence}} {{and growth of}} juvenile chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) from <b>Netarts</b> Bay, Oregon were estimated from daily-formed growth increments of sagittal otoliths which are distinguishable from accretion patterns formed during freshwater residence. Estuarine residence time was inversely related to the average size at which juvenile chum salmon entered <b>Netarts</b> Bay. Among fin-clipped, hatchery fish, large individuals disappeared from <b>Netarts</b> Bay more rapidly than smaller {{members of the same}} release group during the first 9 days of estuarine residence. This selective removal was not evident among creek-reared chum which were smaller than the fin-clipped fish. Size-related emigration explains this variation in residence time.

Each piece of <b>net.art</b> has its originality protected by a guarantee constituted by its URL, which acts as a barrier against reproducibility and/or forgery.

This attempt at giving <b>net.art</b> an economic identity and a legitimation within the art world was questioned even within the <b>net.art</b> sphere, though the project was often understood as a satire.

5000|$|<b>Netarts</b> Bay {{and sand}} spit {{are within the}} {{historic}} territory of the Tillamook Indians, which ranged from Tillamook head in the north to the Nestucca River {{in the south and}} from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Coast Range summit in the east. Cape Lookout State Park contains 13 suspected archaeological sites, including 6 on <b>Netarts</b> sand spit representing at least one and perhaps up to three major villages. Archaeological excavations of <b>Netarts</b> Sandspit Village (35-TI-1) show evidence of a major Tillamook village that was occupied at least three separate times between 1300-1700 A.D. Excavations revealed semisubterranean cedar plank structures with single pitched roofs, numerous hearths and fire pits, and middens around all house pits. The village contained at least 13 house pits and may have contained up to 30-40 house pits. It has been described as [...] "the most impressive house pit site on State Park lands along the Oregon Coast." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Netarts</b> Bay is {{the setting}} {{of one of the}} largest {{concentrations}} of late prehistoric Native American settlements on the tectonically active Oregon coast. A prehistoric site (35 TI 74) exposed by sea cliff erosion in 1998 {{at the south end of}} the <b>Netarts</b> littoral cell contained a stratigraphic record of activity by prehistoric Native Americans and interbedded paleotsunami deposits. The nearfield paleotsunamis were produced by great Cascadia earthquakes (Mw 8. 5 ± 0. 5) emanating from the Cascadia Subduction Zone offshore, as previously documented in episodically buried tidal marsh surfaces at the south end of <b>Netarts</b> Bay and in many other estuaries in the region. The cultural deposits at 35 TI 74 reflect multiple reoccupations by Native Americans at this barrage creek flood plain site between paleotsunami runup events (≥ 7. 5 m elevation) at 1. 3 ka, 1. 1 ka, 0. 8 – 0. 9 ka, and 0. 3 ka. The conditions that led to the exposure of 35 TI 74 are traced to erosion of a protective beach dune ramp at the south end of the <b>Netarts</b> littoral cell, placing the site within reach of progressive storm-surf erosion. The diminishing geoarchaeological record at 35 TI 74 represents a microcosm of the sea cliff erosional processes that threaten vulnerable prehistoric shoreline archaeological sites along much of the Pacific Northwest Coast.

5000|$|It is {{suspected}} that contact between Europeans and Indians became more numerous and consistent {{in the late}} 1700s. By the time Lewis & Clark arrived in 1806, Indians had firearms and metal implements. The first European settlers arrived in <b>Netarts</b> Bay in 1865, and records suggest native Olympia oysters were abundant in the bay. In fact, there are indications oyster harvests by European settlers began as early as 1868 and {{that at least some}} of these oysters were exported to San Francisco. Historic accounts indicate a shanty town, named Oysterville, was present in the bay during this time, and the bay was sometimes called [...] "Oyster Bay." [...] By 1903 virtually all shore line of the spit was claimed and occupied. Despite early claims, residential use of <b>Netarts</b> sand spit had mostly disappeared by 1920 and subsequent growth concentrated in <b>Netarts</b> along the northeast bay. A commercial oyster cultivating industry was present from 1930-1957; however, the accidental introduction of the Japanese oyster drill led to the collapse of this industry in 1957.|$|R
