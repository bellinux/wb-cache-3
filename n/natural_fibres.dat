5|$|He is {{critical}} of greed for gold, such as the absurdity of using the metal for coins in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of Midas and Croesus. He discusses why gold is unique in its malleability and ductility, far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its ability to be beaten into fine foil with just one ounce, producing 750 leaves four inches square. Fine gold wire can be woven into cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with <b>natural</b> <b>fibres</b> like wool. He once saw Agrippina the Younger, wife of Claudius, at a public show on the Fucine Lake involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. He rejects Herodotus's claims of Indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in Scythia.|$|E

The objective {{of this research is}} to study the feasibility of <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> to introduce in the metal matrix composites for sand casting process. LM 6 is the core material used in this research while <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> used as composite materials as well as to remain the hardness of the materials. The preparation of <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> composites was proposed to introduce in metal matrix composite material. Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB) and kenaf fibre were used in the experimental work. <b>Natural</b> <b>fibre</b> is reinforced in the LM 6 material by using metal casting process with open mould technique. LM 6 material was melted using induction furnace which required 650 oC for melting point. The structure and composition of the composite materials is determined using EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray) to show that fibres are absent on the surface of LM 6. The microstructure of casted natural fibre-LM 6 composites was presented using Zeiss Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. As a result, <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> composites were feasible to be introduced in metal matrix composites and potential for engineering application...|$|R
5|$|The larvae {{of clothes}} moths (mainly Tineola bisselliella and Tinea pellionella) feed on fabrics and carpets, {{particularly}} those that are stored or soiled. The adult females lay batches of eggs on <b>natural</b> <b>fibres,</b> including wool, silk and fur, as well as cotton and linen in blends. The developing larvae spin protective webbing and chew into the fabric, creating holes and specks of excrement. Damage is often concentrated in concealed locations, under collars and near seams of clothing, in folds and crevices in upholstery and round the edges of carpets as well as under furniture. Methods of control include using airtight containers for storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating {{and the use of}} chemicals; mothballs contain volatile insect repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene which deter adults, but to kill the larvae, permethrin, pyrethroids or other insecticides may need to be used.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions. England's Oldham Athletic, who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing in red and white shirts borrowed from a local rugby league club, and Scotland's Clyde wore khaki. In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with V-necks replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy <b>natural</b> <b>fibres.</b> The first boots to be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by Adidas in 1954. Although they cost {{twice as much as}} existing styles the boots were a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with screw-in studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions. Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war, and Eastern European teams continued to wear kits that were deemed old-fashioned elsewhere. The FC Dynamo Moscow team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew almost as much comment for the players' long baggy shorts as for the quality of their football. With the advent of international competitions such as the European Cup, the southern European style spread {{to the rest of the}} continent and by the end of the decade the heavy shirts and boots of the pre-war years had fallen entirely out of use. The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which looked good under the newly adopted floodlights. Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.|$|E

However, when {{end of life}} scenarios are considered, the results suggest much larger GHG emission reductions for <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> than foam mattresses. Refurbishing <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> mattresses and reusing the springs, coupled with recycling the waste components, can reduce GHG emissions by 90 % compared to sending the mattresses to landfill. Incinerating mattresses via {{combined heat and power}} plants for electricity production and converting the waste textiles to ethanol are also shown to reduce GHG emissions, though to a lesser extent than refurbishment and recycling. Mattresses are normally disposed of via landfill however designing for reuse and recycling, coupled with supportive policy and legislation, may encourage more <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> mattresses and recycling.

40|$|Natural fibre-reinforced {{plastics}} (NFRP) with renewable polymers as matrices {{are expected}} to be an increasing market in the future. In this context the quantification of <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> volume content in composites is an important parameter for manufacturers to check the laminate quality. This paper reports a new time and cost efficient method for the determination of <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> volume content with a good reproducibility. The measurement of the <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> volume content is attributed to the quantification of the total carbon content of the composite as sum parameter determined by chemical ultimate analysis never used for fibre-reinforced plastics before. The differentiation of resin matrix and <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> is possible by accounting the different carbon fractions of both components. The fibre weight content can be determined from the detected total carbon of the test samples after the measurement of a calibration line from mix standards. Based on the known densities of the <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> and of the resin matrix, the fibre weight content is converted into the corresponding volume content. The fibre volume content of porous and also compact composite parts can be calculated by this approach.

If the underwear soaks up this moisture it will feel cold and clammy, particularly if this layer is against the skin. Materials which wick the moisture away from the skin and do not soak up the condensate will be more comfortable.

25|$|Inclusions of {{different}} sorts mixed with soil {{have been used}} for thousands of years. They were used in roadway construction in Roman days to stabilize roadways and their edges. These early attempts were made of <b>natural</b> <b>fibres,</b> fabrics or vegetation mixed with soil to improve road quality, particularly when roads were built on unstable soil. They were also used to build steep slopes as with several pyramids in Egypt and walls as well. A fundamental problem with using natural materials (wood, cotton, etc.) in a buried environment is the biodegradation that occurs from microorganisms in the soil. With the advent of polymers {{in the middle of the}} 20th century a much more stable material became available. When properly formulated, lifetimes of centuries can be predicted even for harsh environmental conditions.|$|E

The experimental setting is based on a full-factorial design of experiments. The range of these factors is set as: mixing temperature 165 - 175 °C, mixing time 12 - 20 min and speed of rotation 30 - 50 rpm. The results of a factorial analysis show that the mixing temperature has the most evident impact on all three mechanical properties and the flexural strength has lowest sensitivity to all the three experimental conditions. Finally confirmation experiments were conducted under the optimized conditions, resulting in significant high mechanical properties. ...|$|R
