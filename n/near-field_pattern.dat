5000|$|For {{an optical}} fiber, the {{effective}} mode volume is {{the square of the}} product of the diameter of the <b>near-field</b> <b>pattern</b> and the sine of the radiation angle of the far-field pattern. The diameter of the near-field radiation pattern is defined here as the full width at half maximum and the radiation angle at half maximum radiant intensity. Effective mode volume is proportional to the breadth of the relative distribution of power amongst the modes in a multimode fiber. It is not truly a spatial volume but rather an [...] "optical volume" [...] equal to the product of area and solid angle. The power divided by the {{effective mode volume}} is proportional to the radiance of the light emitted by the fiber.|$|E

40|$|Iterative phase {{retrieval}} {{has been}} used to reconstruct the near-field distribution behind tailored X-ray waveguide arrays, by inversion of the measured far-field pattern recorded under fully coherent conditions. It is thereby shown that multi-waveguide interference can be exploited to control the near-field distribution behind the waveguide exit. This can, for example, serve to create a secondary quasi-focal spot outside the waveguide structure. For this proof of concept, an array of seven planar Ni/C waveguides are used, with precisely varied guiding layer thickness and cladding layer thickness, as fabricated by high-precision magnetron sputtering systems. The controlled thickness variations in the range of 0. 2  nm results in a desired phase shift of the different waveguide beams.
