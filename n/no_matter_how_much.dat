5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>much,</b> for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E

40|$|In {{their recent}} comment, {{published}} in Nature, Jeffrey T. Leek and Roger D. Peng discuss how P-values are widely abused in null hypothesis significance testing. We agree completely {{with them and}} in this short comment we discuss the importance of sample homogeneity tests. <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> with <b>how</b> <b>much</b> scrutiny data are gathered if homogeneity tests are not performed the significance tests suffer from sample homogeneity loophole and the results may not be trusted. For example sample homogeneity loophole was not closed in the experiment testing local realism in which a significant violation of Eberhard inequality was found. We are not surprised that Bell type inequalities are violated since if the contextual character of quantum observables is properly taken into account these inequalities cannot be proven. However in order to trust {{the significance of the}} violation sample homogeneity loophole must be closed. Therefore we repeat after Jeffrey T. Leek and Roger D. Peng that sample homogeneity loophole is probably {{just the tip of the}} iceberg. Comment: 4 page...|$|R

50|$|Although {{she joined}} the Futurists in celebrating the virtues of virility, she also wrote: It is absurd to divide {{humanity}} into men and women. It is composed only of femininity and masculinity. Every superman, every hero, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> epic, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of a genius, or how powerful, is the prodigious expression of a race and an epoch only because he is composed atonce of feminine and masculine elements, of femininity and masculinity: that is, a complete being....It is {{the same way with}} any collectivity and any moment in humanity, just as it is with individuals. The fecund periods, when the most heroes and geniuses come forth from the terrain of culture in all its ebullience, are rich in masculinity and femininity.Those periods that had only wars, with few representative heroes because the epic breath flattened them out, were exclusively virile periods; those that denied the heroic instinct and, turning toward the past, annihilated themselves in dreams of peace, were periods in which femininity was dominant. We are living {{at the end of one}} of these periods. What is most lacking in women as in men is virility.That is why Futurism, even with all its exaggerations, is right.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} points made by dam expansion opponents is that raising the dam will not create more water (in fact it will actually cause some water loss due to evaporation) but merely increases the capacity to store it.

The cost of the dam raise is projected at $500 million-$1 billion.

Raising the dam would destroy much of their little remaining land.|$|E
