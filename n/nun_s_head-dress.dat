50|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{promulgation}} of the decretal, walls, locked doors, and barred and grated windows became nearly (but not completely) ubiquitous in monasteries. Architectural divisions became prominent markets of the regulation of the shared space that remained (such as chapels). However, the delay of the implementation of claustration in some areas was dramatic; for example, in Lower Saxony, the enclosure of female monastic communities did not become prominent until the mid-fifteenth century (due to the efforts of Johannes Busch). According to Lowe, Venice was the only state in the Italian peninsula which did not eventually implement the decretal due to a dispute between the patriarch of Grado and the pope over the <b>nuns</b> of <b>S.</b> Maria Celeste.|$|R

This thesis {{analyzes the}} proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) and efforts to prevent {{the proliferation of}} this deadly category of weapons {{in order to assess}} whether or not current initiatives are efficient in dealing with this global pandemic. The category of SALW will be defined and discussed in the second chapter of the thesis while also examining the historical trends in both SALW proliferation and in efforts to counter this proliferation. It will seek to give explanations on why this category is the category regrouping weapons that are the weapons of choice in most current conflicts. This will enable an accurate analysis of the consequences of SALW proliferation. The thesis will also trace the evolution of both international and regional agreements aiming to prevent SALW proliferation in order to evaluate whether or not the steps taken so far are efficient in dealing with the problem, and to highlight areas that can be further improved to better prevent SALW proliferation and misuse. <b>Nun,</b> YaseminM. <b>S...</b>|$|R
40|$|Amazon's {{leadership}} {{has set a}} goal to achieve a highly automated warehouse by 2020. Automation involves two challenges, physical movement and decision-making. Decision making often increase variability, defects and consumes time. The goal {{of this paper is}} to offer a structured framework to design a machine-learning based solution to automate decisions. It will leverage recorded decisions made by Amazon's employees every minute. Using the stow problem as an example, the paper will showcase how captured decision data can be a source of knowledge about processes and products. The stow case is a perfect example for non-trivial continuous decision making process. The workers' decisions are recorded but to this day Amazon does not leverage them for learning purposes. Our framework will offer a few outcomes: 1) High accuracy decision model, improving forecasting abilities from 59 % to 95 % 2) Self healing mechanism and learning system 3) Coaching and training tool. Using only the first outcome, cost savings are estimated to be over $ 25 M annually across the US network. This paper will also discuss the psychological implication for decision automation while keeping manual work as part of the process. by Shai Ben <b>Nun.</b> Thesis: <b>S.</b> M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, in conjunction with the Leaders for Global Operations Program at MIT, 2017.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} the non-human (the natural, not the other-worldly) {{world and its}} creatures were voiced in several late medieval English texts: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Nun</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Priest 2 ̆ 7 s Tale and Manciple 2 ̆ 7 s Tale, and the Towneley Second Shepherds 2 ̆ 7 Play. The dissertation is organized into three chapters which severally allocate voicing the non-human to three different (although conceivably overlapping) modes of representation - acoustic, formal, and performative. Underpinning this project is the objective to place these texts in a historicized ecocritical context. In the first chapter I analyze the figurative (and formative) sounds the natural world 2 ̆ 2 speaks 2 ̆ 2 as it advances a crescendo of insistent clamor in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. I argue that this poem exploits the common (and serviceable) conviction of the analogous equivalency of the two categories woman and nature - in order to register the anxieties engendered by the encroachments {{of women and the}} natural world in post-plague England. The second chapter addresses how the voices of domestication and its discontents unfold in the use Chaucer makes of the protean genres of fable and exemplum, proverbs, and the deployment of similes in two of his bird tales. I rely on current theorizing of interspecies and intra-species domestication to identify and extract the discontents I have found to be inhering in its processes: savagery/violence, hybridity, uninvited and unintended transformations, and theft. The third chapter considers how human and non-human voices confoundingly yet steadily implicated and entangled in one another - performatively discover homes amid multiple ranges, including silence, volume, laughter, and music. This chapter represents the effort to subtend and complicate existing understandings of this popular late medieval pageant by thinking in terms of ranges, variations, and multivalent characterizations, rather than slots, hierarchies, stabilities, and characters who have become little more than canned effigies. In conclusion, I argue that late medieval poetic texts show a remarkable diversity in the ways and means their authors chose to variously voice the non-human, and that the particular forms this voicing took shaped, even as it was shaped, by the non-human world around them. This diversity and variation enables a more complex understanding of the different avenues and directions this voicing afforded to succeeding generations...|$|R
40|$|The medieval {{understanding}} of Cain, fratricide and 2 ̆ 2 vagabond on the earth, 2 ̆ 2 and Nimrod, tyrannical giant and {{architect of the}} Tower of Babel, prompted the figuration of movement as an erotic act and the corollary figuration of sexuality as movement, a process I term 2 ̆ 2 the erotics of wandering. 2 ̆ 2 Cain 2 ̆ 7 s vagrancy was consonant {{with the belief that}} his descendants 2 ̆ 7 errant sodomy caused the Flood, and Nimrod 2 ̆ 7 s desire 2 ̆ 2 to penetrate heaven beyond nature 2 ̆ 2 contributed to the figuration of lechery as a form of illicit penetration. This dissertation examines such erotics in various categories aligned with 2 ̆ 2 wandering, 2 ̆ 2 whether literal or metaphorical, that were associated with Cain or Nimrod. The Alliterative Morte Arthure presents Arthur as a new Nimrod whose crusade is inherently sodomitical; likewise, Dante 2 ̆ 7 s Ulysses exhorts his 2 ̆ 2 brothers 2 ̆ 2 to transgress sanctioned bounds on an anti-crusade, aligning him with the lustful of Purgatorio 26. The idea of genealogical 2 ̆ 2 wandering 2 ̆ 2 predominates in Abelard 2 ̆ 7 s Historia Calamitatum and Langland 2 ̆ 7 s Piers Plowman, which depict social outcasts as agents of frustration: Abelard 2 ̆ 7 s abandonment of his birthright and Cainite exile are metaphysical versions of his castration, and Langland 2 ̆ 7 s bastards and friars both descend from Cain and enact sodomitical lechery. Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Nun</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Priest 2 ̆ 7 s Tale, in its engagement with the charged concepts of tyranny and scriptural translation, depicts 2 ̆ 2 woman 2 ̆ 2 and the peasantry in the context of Nimrodian confusion. Although in exploring such errancy these narratives attempt to displace sinfulness onto an 2 ̆ 2 Other, 2 ̆ 2 whether it be the Muslims, sodomites, or friars, they are themselves implicated in the Cainite and Nimrodian erotics of wandering. For rhetoric itself, according to medieval thinkers, was a process of movement that entailed the risk of lecherous promiscuity or sodomitical transgression. Abelard 2 ̆ 7 s narrative circularity, for example, conflicts with Augustine 2 ̆ 7 s model of autobiographical progression; Piers Plowman, although it accuses the friars of exceeding divinely ordained measure, transgresses that very bound in its succession of genres and lack of structure; and Chaucer 2 ̆ 7 s program of displacement (epitomized by Chauntecleer 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Mulier est hominis confusio 2 ̆ 2), which registers in the context of debates over the translation of Latinate authority into the feminine vernacular, confirms his anxieties that his narratives 2 ̆ 2 sownen into synne. 2 ̆ 2...|$|R
