5|$|The {{conflicts}} with Pyrrhus {{would have a}} great effect on Rome. It had shown that it was capable of pitting its armies successfully against the dominant military powers of the Mediterranean, and further showed that the Greek kingdoms were incapable of defending their colonies in Italy and abroad. Rome quickly moved into southern Italia, subjugating and dividing Magna Grecia. Effectively dominating the Italian peninsula, and with a proven international military reputation, Rome now began to look to expand from the Italian mainland. Since the Alps formed a natural barrier to the north, and Rome was <b>none</b> <b>too</b> keen to meet the fierce Gauls in battle once more, the city's gaze turned to Sicily and the islands of the Mediterranean, a policy that would bring it into direct conflict with its former ally Carthage.|$|E

As a result, Canada's participation in resolving his crisis was a model for the world.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Stanton {{worked to}} create an {{effective}} transportation and communication network across the North. His efforts focused on the railroad system and the telegraph lines. Stanton worked with Senator Wade to push through Congress {{a bill that would}} codify the ability of the President and his administration to forcibly seize railroad and telegraph lines for their purposes. Railroad companies in the North were accommodating to the needs and desires of the federal government for the most part, and the law was rarely used. Stanton also secured the government's use of telegraph. He relocated the military's telegraphing operations from McClellan's army headquarters to his department, a decision the general was <b>none</b> <b>too</b> pleased with. The relocation gave Stanton closer control over the military's communications operations, and he exploited this. Stanton forced all members of the press to work through Assistant Secretary Watson, where unwanted journalists would be disallowed access to official government correspondence. If a member of the press went elsewhere in the department, they would be charged with espionage.|$|E

500|$|In addition, the {{nationalistic sentiments}} that {{exacerbated}} the naval arms race {{gave way to}} slowing economies and negative public opinions which came to support investing inside the country instead. Commenting on this, the United States' Minister to Chile, Henry Prather Fletcher, wrote to Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan: [...] "Since the naval rivalry began in 1910, financial conditions, which were <b>none</b> <b>too</b> good then, have grown worse; and as time approaches for the final payment, feeling has been growing in these countries that perhaps {{they are much more}} in need of money than of battleships." ...|$|E
500|$|Ophuls {{constructed}} {{an entire}} Czech {{village in the}} studio to provide an authentic background. Following the film's US release in 1934, The New York Times commented that it [...] "carr most of the comedy of the original" [...] but was [...] "rather weak on the musical side", {{despite the presence of}} stars such as Novotná. Opera-lovers, the review suggested, should not expect too much, but the work nevertheless gave an attractive portrait of Bohemian village life in the mid-19th century. The reviewer found most of the acting first-rate, but commented that [...] "the photography and sound reproduction are <b>none</b> <b>too</b> clear at times." [...] Other film adaptations of the opera were made in 1922 directed by Oldrich Kminek (Atropos), in 1933, directed by Jaroslav Kvapil, Svatopluk Innemann and Emil Pollert (Espofilm), and in 1976, directed by Václav Kašlík (Barrandov).

500|$|The {{passage is}} obscure, but Cerutti and Richardson argue that Gracchus begins the fight as a loincloth-wearing retiarius. When the tide turns against him, he dons a tunic and a womanish wig (spira), {{apparently}} {{part of the}} same costume, and thus enjoys a reprieve, although this attire may not itself have been considered effeminate as it was also worn by the priests of Mars of whom Gracchus was the chief priest. The change of clothing seems to turn a serious fight into a comical one and shames his opponent. It is unusual to see a gladiator depicted this way in a satire, as such fighters usually take the role of men who are [...] "brawny, brutal, sexually successful with women of both high and low status, but especially the latter, ill-educated if not uneducated, and <b>none</b> <b>too</b> bright intellectually." [...] The retiarius tunicatus in the satire is the opposite: [...] "a mock gladiatorial figure, of equivocal sex, regularly dressed in costume of some sort, possibly usually as a woman, and matched against a secutor or murmillo in a mock gladiatorial exhibition." ...|$|E

No parent should allow a young child to see this traumatizing movie; it would be a cinematic form of child abuse. Even Harrison Ford is required to slap Quan and abuse Capshaw. There are no heroes connected with the film, only two villains; their names are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas." [...] The Observer described it as [...] "a thin, arch, graceless affair." [...] The Guardian summarized it as [...] "a two-hour series of <b>none</b> <b>too</b> carefully linked chase sequences ... {{sitting on the edge of}} your seat gives you a sore bum but also a numb brain."

500|$|Irving Louis Horowitz, in his The Decomposition of Sociology (1994), {{has argued}} that the discipline, while {{arriving}} from a [...] "distinguished lineage and tradition", is in decline due to deeply ideological theory and a lack of relevance to policy making: [...] "The decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking, and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian triumphs." [...] Furthermore: [...] "A problem yet unmentioned is that sociology's malaise has left all the social sciences vulnerable to pure positivism—to an empiricism lacking any theoretical basis. Talented individuals who might, in an earlier time, have gone into sociology are seeking intellectual stimulation in business, law, the natural sciences, and even creative writing; this drains sociology of much needed potential." [...] Horowitz cites the lack of a 'core discipline' as exacerbating the problem. Randall Collins, the Dorothy Swaine Thomas Professor in Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania {{and a member of the}} Advisory Editors Council of the Social Evolution & History journal, has voiced similar sentiments: [...] "we have lost all coherence as a discipline, we are breaking up into a conglomerate of specialities, each going on its own way and with <b>none</b> <b>too</b> high regard for each other." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2014, however, celebrity gossip site TMZ {{reported}} {{that according to}} multiple sources that the reason Muhney was allegedly let go from the soap was because Muhney had sexually harassed co-star Hunter King (who portrays Summer Newman). The site wrote: [...] "38-year-old Muhney allegedly bullied and harassed 20-year-old Hunter King, who plays Summer on the show. She went to higher-ups and complained recently Muhney had fondled her breasts on 2 occasions — and she said both were unsolicited and unwanted." [...] The rumor generated significant negative publicity for the soap opera; Margaret Eby of the New York Daily News wrote, [...] "The set of [...] "The Young and the Restless" [...] may have turned into a real life soap opera thanks to star Michael Muhney, who was allegedly fired for groping one of his co-workers." [...] Fox News {{reported that}} several viewers were upset by Muhney's firing and the sexual harassment allegations, writing: [...] "Many Y fans were <b>none</b> <b>too</b> pleased to find out Muhney was leaving, and several blasted the allegations." [...] TMZ later reported that angered viewers had paid US$785 to have an airplane fly over CBS Studios in Los Angeles with a banner to have Muhney rehired, and the plane flew three days later. Muhney made his final appearance on January 30, 2014. In August 2014, Muhney claimed on his Twitter page that the allegations were indeed false {{and it was only}} a salacious rumor.|$|E
500|$|Turan cited Ball's lack of {{constraint}} {{when writing}} {{the film as}} the reason for its uniqueness, in particular the script's subtle changes in tone. McCarthy said the script was [...] "as fresh and distinctive" [...] as any of its American film contemporaries, and praised how it analyzed the characters while not compromising narrative pace. He called Ball's dialogue [...] "tart" [...] and said the characters—Carolyn excepted—were [...] "deeply drawn". One other flaw, McCarthy said, was the revelation of Col. Fitts' homosexuality, which he said evoked [...] "hoary Freudianism". Jackson said the film transcended its clichéd setup to become a [...] "wonderfully resourceful and sombre comedy". He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs, it did so with [...] "unexpected nuance". Hentzi criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester's murder, believing it manipulative and simply a way of generating suspense. McCarthy cited the production and costume design as pluses, and said the soundtrack was good at creating [...] "ironic counterpoint" [...] to the story. Hentzi concluded that American Beauty was [...] "vital but uneven"; he felt the film's examination of [...] "the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other's lives" [...] was its best point, and that although Lester and Angela's dynamic was familiar, its romantic irony stood beside [...] "the most enduring literary treatments" [...] of the theme, such as Lolita. Nevertheless, Hentzi believed that the film's themes of materialism and conformity in American suburbia were [...] "hackneyed". McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar, but said it merely provided the film with a [...] "starting point" [...] from which to tell its [...] "subtle and acutely judged tale". Maslin agreed; she said that while it [...] "takes aim at targets that are <b>none</b> <b>too</b> fresh", and that the theme of nonconformity did not surprise, the film had its own [...] "corrosive novelty". Ebert awarded American Beauty four stars out of four, and Turan said it was layered, subversive, complex, and surprising, concluding it was [...] "a hell of a picture".|$|E
