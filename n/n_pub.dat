J. de Vega, I. Khalatnikov, <b>N.</b> Sanchez. (Kluwer <b>Pub)</b> String theory properly describes black-hole evaporation. The quantum string emission by Black Holes is computed. The black-hole temperature is the Hawking temperature in the semiclassical quantum field theory (QFT) regime and becomes the intrinsic string temperature, T_s, in the quantum (last stage) string regime. The QFT-Hawking temperature T_H is upper bounded by the string temperature T_S. The black hole emission spectrum is an incomplete gamma function of (T_H - T_S). For T_H << T_S, it yields the QFT-Hawking emission. For T_H → T_S, it shows highly massive string states dominate the emission and undergo a typical string phase transition to a microscopic `minimal' black hole of mass M_ or radius r_ (inversely proportional to T_S) and string temperature T_S. The string back reaction effect (selfconsistent black hole solution of the semiclassical Einstein equations) is computed. Both, the QFT and string black hole regimes are well defined and bounded. The string `minimal' black hole has a life time tau_min simeq (k_B c) /(G hbar [T_S]^ 3). The semiclassical QFT black hole (of mass M and temperature T_H) and the string black hole (of mass M_min and temperature T_S) are mapped one into another by a `Dual' transform which links classical/QFT and quantum string regimes...|$|R
40|$|Accurate and {{powerful}} analytic and computational methods developped {{by the author}} allow to obtain the highly non trivial total absorption spectrum of the Black Hole, as well as phase shifts and cross sections (elastic and inelastic), the angular distribution of absorbed and scattered waves, and the Hawking emission rates. The exact total absorption spectrum of waves by the Black Hole presents {{as a function of}} frequency a remarkable oscillatory behaviour characteristic of a diffraction pattern. It oscillates around its optical geometric limit (27 / 4) pi (r_s) ^ 2 with decreasing amplitude and almost constant period. This is an unique distinctive feature of the black hole absorption, and due to its r= 0 singularity. Ordinary absorptive bodies and optical models do not present these features. The Hamiltonian describing the wave-black hole interaction is non hermitian (despite being real) due to its singularity at the origin (r= 0). The unitarity optical theorem of scattering theory is generalized to the black hole case explicitely showing that absorption takes place only at the origin (r = 0). All these results allow to understand and reproduce the Black Hole absorption spectrum in terms of Fresnel-Kirchoff diffraction theory. These fundamental features will be present for generic higher dimensional Black Hole backgrounds, and whatever the low energy effective theory they arise from. In recent and increasing litterature on absorption cross sections (`grey body factors') of black holes (whatever ordinary, stringy, D-braned), the fundamental remarkable features of the Black Hole Absorption spectrum are overlooked.

40|$|We {{present a}} minimal {{model for the}} Universe {{evolution}} fully extracted from effective String Theory. This model is by its construction close to the standard cosmological evolution, and it is driven selfconsistently by {{the evolution of the}} string equation of state itself. The inflationary String Driven stage is able to reach enough inflation, describing a Big Bang like evolution for the metric. By linking this model to a minimal but well established observational information, (the transition times of the different cosmological epochs), we prove that it gives realistic predictions on early and current energy density and its results are compatible with General Relativity. Interestingly enough, the predicted current energy density is found Omega = 1 and a lower limit Omega ≥ 4 / 9 is also found. The energy density at the exit of the inflationary stage also gives | Omega |_inf= 1. This result shows an agreement with General Relativity (spatially flat metric gives critical energy density) within an inequivalent Non-Einstenian context (string low energy effective equations). The order of magnitude of the energy density-dilaton coupled term {{at the beginning of the}} radiation dominated stage agrees with the GUT scale. The predicted graviton spectrum is computed and analyzed without any free parameters. Peaks and asymptotic behaviours of the spectrum are a direct consequence of the dilaton involved and not only of the scale factor evolution. Drastic changes are found at high frequencies: the dilaton produces an increasing spectrum (in no string cosmologies the spectrum is decreasing). Without solving the known problems about higher order corrections and graceful exit of inflation, we find this model closer to the observational Universe than the current available string cosmology scenarii.

40|$|Abstract Background The UK {{government}} proposed introducing partial smokefree {{legislation for}} England with exemptions for pubs and bars {{that do not}} prepare and serve food. We set out {{to test the hypothesis}} that pubs from more deprived areas and non food-serving pubs have higher levels of particulate air pollution. Methods We conducted a cross sectional study in four mainly urban areas of the North West of England. We recruited a stratified random sample of 64 pubs divided into four groups based on whether their local population was affluent or deprived (using a UK area based deprivation measure), {{and whether or not they}} served food. The timing of air quality monitoring stratified to ensure similar distribution of monitoring by day of the week and time of evening between groups. We used a portable air quality monitor to collect fine particle (PM 2. 5) levels over a minimum of 30 minutes in areas where smoking was allowed,, and calculated mean time-time weighted average PM 2. 5 levels. Results Mean PM 2. 5 was 285. 5 μg/m 3 (95 % CI 212. 7 to 358. 3). Mean levels in the four groups were: affluent food-serving <b>pubs</b> (<b>n</b> = 16) 188. 1 μg/m 3 (95 %CI 128. 1 to 248. 1); affluent non food-serving (n = 16) 186. 8 μg/m 3 (95 %CI 118. 9 to 254. 3); deprived food-serving (n = 17) 399. 4 μg/m 3 (95 %CI 177. 7 to 621. 2); and deprived non food-serving (n = 15) 365. 7 μg/m 3 (195. 6 to 535. 7). Levels were higher in pubs in deprived communities: mean 383. 6 μg/m 3 (95 % CI 249. 2 to 518. 0) vs 187. 4 μg/m 3 (144. 8 to 229. 9); geometric mean 245. 2 μg/m 3 vs 151. 2 μg/m 3 (p = 0. 03). There was little difference in particulate levels between food and non food-serving pubs. Conclusion This study adds to the evidence that the UK government’s proposals for partial smokefree legislation in England would offer the least protection to the most heavily exposed group - bar workers and customers in non food-serving pubs in deprived areas. The results suggest these proposals would work against the UK government’s stated aim to reduce health inequalities. </p...|$|R
