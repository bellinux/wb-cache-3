25|$|During {{the history}} of slavery in the United States, most African Americans styled their hair {{in an attempt to}} mimic the styles of the {{predominantly}} white society in which they lived. Afro-textured hair, characterized by its tight kinks, has been described as being kinky, coarse, cottony, <b>nappy,</b> or woolly. These characteristics represented the antithesis of the European American standard of beauty, and led to a negative view of kinky hair. As a result, the practice of straightening gained popularity among African Americans.|$|E

25|$|A diaper (American English) or a <b>nappy</b> (British English) {{is a type}} of {{underwear}} that allows the wearer to defecate or urinate without the use of a toilet, by absorbing or containing waste products to prevent soiling of outer clothing or the external environment.

25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s <b>nappy?</b> For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

500|$|Sos most {{prominent}} political statement, [...] "Don't Give Up", was fuelled by Gabriel's discontent with rising unemployment during Margaret Thatcher's premiership and Dorothea Lange's photograph [...] "Migrant Mother". The track {{began as a}} rhythm pattern of slow, low-pitched tom-tom drums that Gabriel made, and Lanois believed could serve as the centrepiece of a song. Tony Levin added bass {{to create a more}} harmonious sound, and {{during the second half of}} the track, put a <b>nappy</b> behind his bass strings to dampen the sound. Gabriel ensured the song, which follows a narrative of an unemployed man and his lover, was written as a conversational piece. He initially sought out Dolly Parton to portray the woman, although Parton declined; his friend Kate Bush later agreed to feature. Bush serves as the song's respondent, she assumes a comforting role and with delicate vocals, sings lines such as [...] "Rest your head/ you worry too much". The album's first side culminates with [...] "That Voice Again", in which Gabriel explores the concept of conscience, examining the [...] "parental voice in our heads that either helps or defeats us". Co-written with David Rhodes, who plays guitar over Katché and Levin's input, the song was written after Gabriel's initial discussions with Martin Scorsese about scoring The Last Temptation of Christ (1988).|$|E

2500|$|A diaper or <b>nappy</b> is an {{absorbent}} garment for incontinent people. The dampless or waterproof diaper {{was invented}} in 1946 when Marion Donovan used a shower curtain from her bathroom to create the [...] "Boater", the first re-usable and leak-proof diaper that contained plastic-lined cloth. Donovan's other innovation was replacing safety pins with plastic snaps {{on the sides of}} diapers. First sold in 1949 at Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store in New York City, patents were later issued in 1951 to Donovan who later sold the rights to the waterproof diaper for $1 million.|$|E

Its opening was originally under a nearby house, which had been rebuilt farther away after a fire. The city had widened {{the street and the}} cesspit was lost. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the antebellum}} and postbellum periods in American slavery, the black body {{was made into}} a part of a mass {{marketing}} scheme. Stereotypes centered around the negative connotations of blacks having dark skin, <b>nappy</b> hair, and other physical attributes. The specific female and male stereotypes were generally known as: the Sambo, the Mammy, and the Uncle Tom. The Mammy is represented by the fat, nurturing, black female domestic worker. Uncle Tom, is the elderly, submissive, male servant. Blanche and Nate view their role as the Mammy and Uncle Tom separate from their true identities. [...] "They view the stereotypical roles as their performance in a larger satire about misperception. They slip {{into and out of the}} Mammy and Uncle Tome stereotype as they see fit."
