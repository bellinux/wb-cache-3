5|$|In rare individuals, {{paracetamol}} toxicity {{can result}} from <b>normal</b> <b>use.</b> This {{may be due to}} individual ("idiosyncratic") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the metabolic pathways that handle paracetamol (see paracetamol's metabolism).|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{method of}} prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition, alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following <b>normal</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{a member}} of the {{prominent}} American Roosevelt and Livingston families and a niece of President Theodore Roosevelt. She had an unhappy childhood, having suffered the deaths of both parents and one of her brothers at a young age. At 15, she attended Allenwood Academy in London and was deeply influenced by its feminist headmistress Marie Souvestre. Returning to the U.S., she married her fifth cousin once removed, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in 1905. The Roosevelts' marriage was complicated from the beginning by Franklin's controlling mother, Sara, and after Eleanor discovered her husband's affair with Lucy Mercer in 1918, she resolved to seek fulfillment in a public life of her own. She persuaded Franklin to stay in politics after he was stricken with debilitating polio in 1921, which cost him the <b>normal</b> <b>use</b> of his legs, and Roosevelt began giving speeches and appearing at campaign events in his place. Following Franklin's election as Governor of New York in 1928, and throughout the remainder of Franklin's public career in government, Roosevelt regularly made public appearances on his behalf, and as First Lady while her husband served as President, she significantly reshaped and redefined the role of that office during her own tenure and beyond, for future First Ladies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the test}} purpose {{will be to}} assess {{whether or not the}} {{accelerated}} model proposed by Eyring will be able to translate results for the shape and scale parameters of an underlying Weibull model, obtained under two accelerating using conditions, to expected <b>normal</b> <b>using</b> condition results for these parameters. The product being analyzed is a new type of insulate fluid, and the accelerating factor is the voltage stresses applied to the fluid at two different levels (30 KV and 40 KV). The normal operating voltage is 25 KV. In this case, it was possible to test the insulate fluid at <b>normal</b> voltage <b>using</b> condition. Both results for the two parameters of the Weibull model, obtained under <b>normal</b> <b>using</b> condition and translated from accelerated <b>using</b> conditions to <b>normal</b> conditions, will be compared to each other to assess the accuracy of the Eyring model when the accelerating factor is only the voltage stress...|$|R

25|$|During braking, the {{friction}} surfaces (brake pads and rims) will experience thermal heating. In <b>normal</b> <b>use</b> {{this is not}} a problem, as the brakes are applied with limited force and for a short time, so the heat quickly dissipates to the surrounding air. However, on a heavily laden bike on a long descent, heat energy may be added more quickly than it can dissipate causing heat build-up, which may damage components and cause brake failure.|$|E
25|$|Cathode {{depletion}} is {{the loss}} of emission after thousands of hours of <b>normal</b> <b>use.</b> Sometimes emission can be restored for a time by raising heater voltage, either for a short time or a permanent increase of a few percent. Cathode depletion was uncommon in signal tubes but was a frequent cause of failure of monochrome television cathode-ray tubes. Usable life of this expensive component was sometimes extended by fitting a boost transformer to increase heater voltage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of <b>normal</b> <b>use,</b> there are three {{predominant}} types of wear on a pointe shoe that will determine its useful lifetime. The {{most important of these}} is shank wear. As the body of the shoe is repetitively flexed, the shank gradually weakens and loses its ability to provide support. A pointe shoe is no longer serviceable when the shank breaks or becomes too soft to provide support. The second is the softening of the box and especially the platform on which the dancer balances.|$|E

25|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the first calculators {{appeared}} with field-effect, twisted nematic (TN) LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them {{to cut out}} damaging ultraviolet rays. The advantage of LCDs {{is that they are}} passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the Casio Mini Card LC-78 of 1978, which could run for months of <b>normal</b> <b>use</b> on button cells.|$|E
