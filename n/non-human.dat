40|$|Various {{arguments}} {{have been}} provided for drawing <b>non-humans</b> such as animals and artificial agents into the sphere of moral consideration. In this paper, I argue for a shift from an ontological to a social-philosophical approach: instead of asking what an entity is, {{we should try to}} conceptually grasp the quasi-social dimension of relations between <b>non-humans</b> and humans. This allows me to reconsider the problem of justice, in particular distributive justice. Engaging with the work of Rawls, I show that an expansion of the contractarian framework to <b>non-humans</b> causes an important problem for liberalism, but can be justified by a contractarian argument. Responding to Bell’s and Nussbaum’s comments on Rawls, I argue that we can justify drawing <b>non-humans</b> into the sphere of distributive justice by relying on the notion of a co-operative scheme. I discuss what co-operation between humans and <b>non-humans</b> can mean {{and the extent to which}} it depends on properties. I conclude that we need to imagine principles of ecological and technological distributive justic...|$|R

They are called rebels against the (four) great kings. Even {{as in the}} kingdom of Magadha, the thieves heed neither the king of Magadha, nor the ministers, nor their attendants, and are called rebels against the king of Magadha, so there are <b>non-humans</b> who are fierce... (as before). They are called rebels against the (four) great kings." ...|$|R
30|$|The {{urgency of}} {{protecting}} endangered species or {{the treatment of}} animals in industrial system of food production {{is not likely to}} be adequately addressed in the current paradigm. In line with Schlosberg’s thesis, in order to move forward we need to embrace the notions of justice based on recognition, capabilities, and participation in relations between human communities and <b>non-humans.</b> If the <b>non-humans</b> are to be entitled to a fair share of essential goods, and their right to ‘flourish’ is recognized, the inclusion of <b>non-humans</b> through eco-advocates within political systems would be the next step.|$|R

5|$|The {{designers}} {{have stated that}} <b>non-human</b> characters and races feature {{a prominent role in}} the game, which was influenced by an interest in history among the developers. Comparing the <b>non-human</b> races in Final Fantasy IX with those of XII, the developers have stated that the former were modeled after humans, while the latter were fundamentally different in terms of biological characteristics. These <b>non-human</b> races include Bangaa, Viera, Seeq, and Moogles. In the game humans are referred to as Humes. Some of the races in the game that first appeared in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, such as Bangaa, were originally designed for Final Fantasy XII.|$|E

5|$|Human {{language}} {{is unique in}} comparison {{to other forms of}} communication, such as those used by <b>non-human</b> animals.

During negotiations, however, Cross Ward, leader of the squadron of knights, disobeys his orders and has the knights attack the dwarves. The dwarves that are not killed in the battle are enslaved. This starts a war between the humans and the <b>non-humans.</b>|$|R

5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to <b>non-human</b> life, but without a {{universal}} consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E

50|$|The {{corresponding}} {{form when}} referring to <b>non-humans</b> is what (which has the emphatic form whatever, and no possessive form). Another similar interrogative is which - this can refer to either humans or <b>non-humans,</b> normally implying selection from a particular set, as either interrogative pronoun (Which do you prefer?) or interrogative determiner (adjective) (Which man should I choose?). What {{can also be used}} as a determiner (What book are you reading?), but who cannot.|$|R

5|$|As suicide {{requires}} a willful attempt to die, some feel it therefore cannot {{be said to}} occur in <b>non-human</b> animals. Suicidal behavior has been observed in salmonella seeking to overcome competing bacteria by triggering an immune system response against them. Suicidal defenses by workers are also noted in the Brazilian ant Forelius pusillus, where {{a small group of}} ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening.|$|E
5|$|Epizootics are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among <b>non-human</b> animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest of cattle, avian and swine influenza, swine fever and bluetongue of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock {{can be devastating}} both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the horse-human relationship. It strives for answering the question how horse and human enact within this relationship and mutual interaction as the actors, which means active subjects that can participate in the relationship. The text tries to analyse how this relationship is influenced by other <b>non-humans,</b> such as the objects in the stable or the literature about horses. The text explores this {{through the lens of}} chosen theoretical and methodological concepts (the multispecies ethnography, Eduardo Kohn's anthropology of life or anthropology beyond the human, Donna Haraway's research of the <b>non-humans</b> and especially Bruno Latour's symmetrical anthropology and actor-network theory) that reach beyond the human and contain animals, objects and other <b>non-humans.</b> The research is based on participant observation and semi-structured interviews with the stable member. The analysis shows that the conditions of the horse-human relationship are mostly defined by the human. The human sets up the barriers within witch the horse can interfere partly (and probably unintentionally) in the mutual relationship by its reactions. The lifeless <b>non-humans</b> can substitute the human role of restricting the horse in this relationship. They can also reflect or reproduce certain notions or [...] ...|$|R
