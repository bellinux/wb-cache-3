Some of these address-harvesting approaches rely on users <b>not</b> <b>reading</b> the fine print of agreements, resulting in their agreeing to send messages indiscriminately to their contacts.

25|$|While the {{enforcement}} in theory {{could lead to}} a Big Brother-style surveillance society, in practice social convention among the Minds prohibits them from watching, or interfering in, citizens' lives unless requested, or unless they perceive severe risk. The practice of reading a sentient's mind without permission (something the Culture is technologically easily capable of) is also strictly taboo. The whole plot of Look to Windward relies on a Hub Mind <b>not</b> <b>reading</b> an agent's mind (with certain precautions in case this rule gets violated). Minds that do so anyway are considered deviant and shunned by other Minds (see GCU Grey Area). At one point it is said that if the Culture actually had written laws, the sanctity of one's own thoughts against the intrusion of others would be the first on the books (Look To Windward).|$|E
25|$|At the hearing, Alagad party-list {{representative}} Rodante Marcoleta questioned if {{the committee}} should {{wait for the}} court's decision on Gutierrez's motion for reconsideration. After the minutes of the previous meeting was approved, Nacionalista Party member Marc Douglas Cagas IV from Davao del Sur's 1st district motioned to reconsider {{the approval of the}} minutes, which was denied by vice chairperson Rodolfo Fariñas (Nacionalista, Ilocos Norte–1st) since Cagas was absent at the previous meeting. After several minutes of arguing whether to wait for a Supreme Court decision, Rodolfo Albano (Lakas-Kampi, Isabela–1st) motioned to wait for the decision; the motion was defeated 8–37. Tupas read a letter submitted by Gutierrez, and the representatives debated anew on whether to wait for the court's decision; Fariñas later bared his plan on filing impeachment cases against the justices for <b>not</b> <b>reading</b> Gutierrez's petition before issuing the status quo ante order. The committee ultimately voted that both complaints were sufficient in grounds, with the first complaint passing on a 41–12 vote, and the second complaint approved on a 42–12 decision.|$|E

[...] Kierkegaard later used his book Prefaces to publicly respond to Heiberg and Hegelianism. Kierkegaard and William Godwin were very similar in their criticism of critics. He also published a short article, Who is the Author of Either/Or?, a week after the publication of Either/Or itself.|$|E
500|$|Simon {{assembled}} {{and led the}} initial team of writers, consisting of John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky.

In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'—that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters." [...] Simon saw The Simpsons {{as a chance to}} solve [...] "what [...] didn't like about the Saturday-morning cartoon shows [...] worked on... wanted all the actors in a room together, <b>not</b> <b>reading</b> their lines separated from each other.

500|$|Publishers Weekly {{assessed}} in its book review, [...] "Taibbi, {{a writer of}} striking intelligence and bold ideas, is as hilarious as he is scathing."> The review pointed out the book's author did not seek objectivity in his work, [...] "The book is strikingly partisan, and the left-of-center readers most likely to laugh out loud will find their mirth tinged with chagrin that’s hard to digest so soon after the recounted events." [...] The review criticized the contradictory nature of Taibbi, {{as a member of}} the press himself, taking time in the book to criticize the media. The review concluded, [...] "Readers new to Taibbi will regret <b>not</b> <b>reading</b> his reporting as events unfolded, as his analysis is equal parts entertaining and enlightening." [...] Kirkus Reviews wrote that throughout the chronology of Taibbi's recounting of the 2016 campaign, the book, [...] "unfolds as a comedy that slowly turns into a horror movie." [...] Kirkus Reviews criticized the author's tone in the beginning of the book, [...] "Taibbi is cleareyed about the populist forces and fractured media landscape Trump exploited, but given his admission of underestimating Trump’s chances, his first-chapter victory lap, which annotates a chapter from his 2008 book, The Great Derangement, to show how much he’s correctly predicted, feels defensive if not unseemly." [...] The piece from Kirkus Reviews concluded, [...] "A lively set of dispatches that shows how even the harshest skeptic in the pundit class can be blindsided." ...|$|E
500|$|Following that, {{he played}} Irish {{attorney}} Tom Lefroy and love-interest to Jane Austen in Becoming Jane, a 2007 historical movie {{inspired by the}} author's early life. Next up was Penelope, which premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival. Also starring co-producer Reese Witherspoon, it generated polarised reviews. The breakthrough role in McAvoy's career came in Atonement, Joe Wright's 2007 adaption of Ian McEwan's novel of the same title. A romantic war film, it focuses on lovers Cecilia and Robbie's (Keira Knightley and McAvoy) lives being torn apart after her jealous younger sister, Briony (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses him of rape. Upon reading the script, McAvoy said he thought [...] "If I don't get the part I'm <b>not</b> <b>reading</b> the book because it'll be devastating. It's an amazing role and I really wanted it." [...] McAvoy has called the film [...] "incredibly sad" [...] but considers it an uplifting experience. He also shared that he hoped viewers will be left [...] "absolutely devastated and harrowed." [...] Screenings of Atonement were held at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, where {{it was one of}} the most acclaimed films present, and Venice Film Festival. Atonement was a big awards contender; it was nominated for fourteen BAFTAs and seven Academy Awards. Both McAvoy and Knightley were nominated for their performances at the 65th Golden Globe Awards, respectively. Additionally, the film was lauded by critics, with Metacritic reporting it to have an approval rating of 85. The Hollywood Reporter writer Ray Bennett said the duo gave [...] "compelling and charismatic performances".|$|E
500|$|Simon {{has been}} {{credited}} with [...] "developing [...] sensibility". Former Simpsons director Brad Bird has described him as [...] "the unsung hero" [...] of the show, while Vitti has stated to [...] "leave out Sam Simon" [...] is to tell [...] "the managed version" [...] of The Simpsons history, because [...] "he was the guy we wrote for." [...] Writer Ken Levine called Simon [...] "the real creative force behind The Simpsons...The tone, the storytelling, the level of humor – that was all developed on Sam's watch." [...] Levine says that Simon [...] "brought a level of honesty to the characters" [...] and made them [...] "three-dimensional", adding that his [...] "comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In The Simpsons, the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?'—that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters." [...] Simon crafted {{much of the world}} of Springfield and designed the models for many of the show's recurring characters, including Mr. Burns, Dr. Hibbert, Chief Wiggum and Eddie and Lou, as well as many of the one-time and guest star roles, such as Bleeding Gums Murphy. One of his contributions to the show's character development was his proposal that Waylon Smithers should be gay, but that this should never have too much attention drawn to it; Smithers' sexuality became one of the show's longest-running gags. [...] Simon saw The Simpsons as a chance to solve [...] "what [...] didn't like about the Saturday-morning cartoon shows [...] worked on... wanted all the actors in a room together, <b>not</b> <b>reading</b> their lines separated from each other.

All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to slam into me for <b>not</b> <b>reading</b> enough, for being generally immature.
