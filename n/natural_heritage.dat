5|$|Conservation of {{the natural}} {{environment}} is well developed in the United Kingdom. There are various public sector organisations with {{an important role in}} the stewardship of the country's flora. Scottish <b>Natural</b> <b>Heritage</b> is the statutory body responsible for <b>natural</b> <b>heritage</b> management in Scotland. One of their duties is to establish National Nature Reserves. Until 2004 there were 73, but a review carried out in that year resulted in a significant number of sites losing their NNR status, and as of 2006 there are 55. The Forestry Commission in Scotland serves as the forestry department of the Scottish Government and is one of the country's largest landowners. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee is the statutory adviser to Government on UK and international nature conservation.|$|E
