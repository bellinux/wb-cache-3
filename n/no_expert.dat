5|$|The {{inscription}} {{created a}} sensation as it mentions four distant countries {{that were the}} targets of adventurous Scandinavian expeditions during the Viking Age, but it also stirred some doubts as to its authenticity. However, thorough geological and runological analyses dispelled any doubts as to its genuine nature. The stone had the same patina as other Viking Age stones on all its surfaces and carvings, and in addition it has the normal r-rune with an open side stroke, something which is usually overlooked by forgerers. Moreover, v Friesen commented {{that there could be}} <b>no</b> <b>expert</b> on Old Swedish that made a forgery while he correctly wrote krikiaʀ as all reference books of the time incorrectly told that the form was grikir.|$|E

25|$|On the efflux of specie, Petty {{thought it}} vain {{to try to}} control it, and dangerous, as it would leave the merchants to decide what goods a nation buys with the smaller amount of money. He noted in Quantulumcunque {{concerning}} money that countries plentiful in gold have no such laws restricting specie. On exports in general, he regarded prescriptions, such as recent Acts of Parliament forbidding the export of wool and yarn, as 'burthensome'. Further restrictions 'would do us twice as much harm as the losse of our said Trade' (p.59), albeit with a concession that he is <b>no</b> <b>expert</b> {{in the study of}} the wool trade.|$|E

500|$|In 1956, Levin {{found himself}} in irreconcilable {{disagreement}} with Truth's support of the Anglo-French military action in the Suez Crisis. The proprietor {{and editor of the}} long-established weekly The Spectator, Ian Gilmour, invited Levin to join his staff. Levin left Truth and became the political correspondent of The Spectator. He declared that he was <b>no</b> <b>expert</b> in politics, but Gilmour advised him, [...] "review it as you would review television". Levin wrote his column under the pseudonym [...] "Taper", from the name of a corrupt political insider in Disraeli's 1844 novel Coningsby.

500|$|From the start, the Mint {{found that}} {{excessive}} pressure {{had to be}} applied to fully bring out the design of the coin, and the dies broke rapidly. On January 10, 1922, O'Reilly, still serving as Acting Mint Director in Baker's absence, ordered production halted. Dies had been sent to the Denver and San Francisco mints in anticipation of beginning coinage there; they were ordered not to begin work until the difficulties had been resolved. The Commission of Fine Arts was asked to advise what changes might solve the problems. Both Fraser and de Francisci were called to Philadelphia, and after repeated attempts to solve the problem without reducing the relief failed, de Francisci agreed to modify his design to reduce the relief. The plaster models he prepared were reduced to coin size using the Mint's Janvier reducing lathe. However, even after 15 years of possessing the pantograph-like device, the Mint had <b>no</b> <b>expert</b> in its use on its staff, and, according to Burdette, [...] "ad a technician from Tiffany's or Medallic Art [...] been called in, the 1922 low relief coins might have turned out noticeably better than they did".|$|E
500|$|Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com {{said that}} despite the {{controversy}} the game was attracting due to alleged racism, <b>no</b> <b>expert</b> opinion had been sought. He asked Glenn Bowman, senior lecturer in social anthropology at the University of Kent, whether he thought the game was racist. Bowman considered the racism accusations [...] "silly", saying that the game had an anti-colonial theme and those complaining about the game's racism might be expressing an [...] "inverted racism which says that you can't have scary people who are black." [...] It was reported that one cutscene in the game scene showed [...] "black men" [...] dragging off a screaming white woman; according to Yin-Poole, the allegation was incorrect and the single man dragging the woman was [...] "not obviously black". The scene was submitted to the British Board of Film Classification for evaluation. BBFC head of communications Sue Clark said, [...] "There is only one man pulling the blonde woman in from the balcony [...] is not black either. As the whole game is set in Africa {{it is hardly surprising}} that some of the characters are black ... we do take racism very seriously, but in this case there is no issue around racism." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gove {{described}} {{his decision to}} campaign for Britain to leave the EU in the EU referendum as [...] "the most difficult decision of my political life". He and his family spent Christmas with the Camerons at Chequers where, according to Craig Oliver, Cameron {{got the impression that}} Gove would support remaining in the EU. He argued Britain would be [...] "freer, fairer and better off" [...] for leaving. When in an interview it was claimed that there was <b>no</b> <b>expert</b> opinion to support this, Gove remarked that [...] "the people of this country have had enough of experts from organizations with acronyms saying they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong." [...] However, interviewer Faisal Islam interrupted Gove after the word [...] "experts", causing some sources to report that he had made a general statement that [...] "the people... have had enough of experts".|$|E
2500|$|Livingstone's letters, books, and {{journals}} did stir up {{public support for}} the abolition of slavery; however, he became dependent for assistance on the very slave-traders whom he wished to put out of business. He was a poor leader of his peers, and he ended up on his last expedition as an individualist explorer with servants and porters but <b>no</b> <b>expert</b> support around him. At the same time, he did not use the brutal methods of maverick explorers such as Stanley to keep his retinue of porters in line and his supplies secure. For these reasons, he accepted help and hospitality from 1867 onwards from Mohamad Bogharib and Mohamad bin Saleh (also known as [...] "Mpamari"), traders who kept and traded in slaves, as he recounts in his journals. They, in turn, benefited from Livingstone's influence with local people, which facilitated Mpamari's release from bondage to Mwata Kazembe. Livingstone was furious to discover that some of the replacement porters sent at his request from Ujiji were slaves.|$|E
2500|$|The Navy Sharpshooter's Badge {{was made}} of antique bronze with a {{rectangular}} brooch that had the word [...] "SHARPSHOOTER" [...] embossed in its center with circling serpent bookends. [...] Below the brooch hung two types of clasps, an Expert Qualification Clasp and a Qualification Year Clasp. [...] From those clasps hung the badge's pendant. [...] The Expert Qualification Clasp is identical in design to the brooch but with the word(s) [...] "EXPERT," [...] for the service rifle, or [...] "EXPERT PISTOL SHOT," [...] for the service pistol. [...] Each time a shooter requalified as expert, another Expert Qualification Clasp was hung from the badge. [...] If <b>no</b> <b>Expert</b> Qualification Clasp was suspended from the badge, then the shooter qualified as a sharpshooter with the service rifle and/or service pistol. [...] The Qualification Year Clasp is different in design from the brooch which incorporated three ovals along its access for the placement of Year Disks. [...] The Year Disk {{was made of}} silver and embossed with the year the shooter qualified/requalified. [...] On the fourth requalification year, another Qualification Year Clasp was hung from the badge with a fourth Year Disk embossed with the year of requalification. [...] There was no limit {{to the number of}} clasps that could be hung from the badge. [...] Hanging from the clasp(s) was the badge's pendant, which was the design basis for today's U.S. Navy marksmanship medals. [...] The only difference between the pendant of the Navy Sharpshooter's Badge and the Navy Expert Rifleman Medal or Expert Pistol Shot Medal is the metal color (from antique bronze to gold), the deletion of the crossed rifles from behind a replica of a rifle target, and the addition of the words [...] "EXPERT RIFLEMAN" [...] or [...] "EXPERT PISTOL SHOT" [...] embossed above the rifle target.|$|E
