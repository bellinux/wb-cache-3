5|$|Burnham would <b>not</b> <b>smoke</b> {{and seldom}} drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of {{his sense of}} smell. He found ways to train himself in mental patience, took power naps instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when {{scouting}} or traveling {{where there was no}} water, he might still be able to exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who seldom spoke of his many adventures.|$|E

25|$|The Illusive Man is {{the leader}} of Cerberus, a pro-human group officially {{regarded}} as a terrorist organisation by the Citadel Council and the humans' Systems Alliance.

Some accounts have suggested that Lin became a drug addict, either to opium or morphine.|$|E
25|$|Research {{funded by}} the U.S. National Institutes of Health {{has shown that the}} average Adventist in California lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian. The research, as cited by the cover story of the November 2005 issue of National Geographic, asserts that Adventists live longer because they do <b>not</b> <b>smoke</b> or drink alcohol, have a day of rest every week, and {{maintain}} a healthy, low-fat vegetarian diet that is rich in nuts and beans. The cohesiveness of Adventists' social networks has also been put forward as an explanation for their extended lifespan.|$|E

25|$|Psychological {{factors in}} health had been studied {{since the early}} 20th century by {{disciplines}} such as psychosomatic medicine and later behavioral medicine, but these were primarily branches of medicine, not psychology. Health psychology began to emerge as a distinct discipline of psychology in the United States in the 1970s. In the mid-20th century there was a growing understanding in medicine {{of the effect of}} behavior on health. For example, the Alameda County Study, which began in the 1960s, showed that people who ate regular meals (e.g., breakfast), maintained a healthy weight, received adequate sleep, did <b>not</b> <b>smoke,</b> drank little alcohol, and exercised regularly were in better health and lived longer. In addition, psychologists and other scientists were discovering relationships between psychological processes and physiological ones. These discoveries include {{a better understanding of the}} impact of psychosocial stress on the cardiovascular and immune systems, and the early finding that the functioning of the immune system could be altered by learning.|$|E
25|$|In {{the title}} sequence, Arthur is shown meeting Terry {{at the prison}} gates {{following}} his release. He drives a white Ford Capri, although it is never made clear whether Terry had bought the vehicle from Arthur, hence their meeting, or if Arthur had given to Terry this car {{as part of their}} ensuing working deal, {{in the same manner as}} the flat that Arthur houses Terry in. (Terry drives a copper coloured Capri in some mid-run episodes, and a silver Capri in several others, and the exact model is seen to vary between different episodes). Terry enjoys a drink but usually responsibly, does <b>not</b> <b>smoke</b> and has an eye for the ladies. Despite his incarceration, he is honest, trustworthy and loyal, particularly to Arthur, although the scrapes that Arthur lands him in make him wonder why. He is intelligent and streetwise enough to disperse situations that his role as minder often lands himself - and Arthur or those around him - in, although at the same time is seen not to be strong willed enough to break free of Arthur's often devious ways of keeping their working relationship in place.|$|E
25|$|Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser): A young, ambitious account {{executive}} {{from an old}} New York family with connections and a privileged background. Often displaying recurring lapses in experience and judgement, Campbell's ruthless {{climb to the top}} causes him to attempt to blackmail Don Draper with the Dick Whitman information he has learned, but it does not work. He and Don are antagonistic some of the time, but later develop a grudging respect for each other, culminating in Don's approaching Pete over Ken Cosgrove when forming a new agency. Campbell and his wife, Trudy, were unable to conceive a child early in their marriage, and he only learned of his child with Olson at the Season 2 finale. He and Trudy do conceive a daughter, Tammy, late in Season 4. At the end of Season 3, dissatisfied with his treatment at Sterling Cooper regarding a promotion, he secretly plans to leave the firm. Unaware of this, Don Draper approaches Campbell with an offer to join his new firm as long as Pete brings accounts worth $8 million of cash flow. Campbell decides to join Draper, with the condition that he be made a partner, though his surname does not appear in the new firm's name (Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce). Campbell {{is one of the few}} characters in the show who does <b>not</b> <b>smoke</b> cigarettes, though he is seen smoking marijuana on one occasion. He looks up to Don in many ways. Campbell is often shown cheating on his wife, and is not above manipulating and blackmailing women to get them to sleep with him. While Pete and Trudy separate in Season 6 after another one of his affairs, the two reconcile at the end of the series as Pete takes a lucrative offer with Learjet in Wichita, Kansas.|$|E

500|$|Attacks on the {{theories}} surrounding {{the ability of}} tobacco to cure diseases had begun early in the 17th century.
