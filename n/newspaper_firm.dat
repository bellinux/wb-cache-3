Using data from 15 publicly traded companies before, during, and after the recession, correlation and regression analyses were conducted to study the effects of the size and diversification variables. The authors conclude that larger firms were more affected by the recession than smaller firms and that nonnewspaper diversification reduced the effects of the recession. Larger firms were more rapidly affected by the recession, placed greater controls on expenses during the recession, and emerged from the recession more slowly than smaller <b>newspaper</b> <b>firms.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The e-newspaper introduction- {{charting}} infrastructure {{influence on}} production, distribution and consumption Carina Ihlström, PhD * and Maria Åkesson** Keywords: E-paper technology, infrastructure, preferences The <b>newspaper</b> <b>firms</b> are facing an innovation, the e-newspaper published on e-paper technology. The e-paper is reflecting, giving the same reader experience as paper (such as high contrast {{and the possibility}} to read in sunlight) and is thin, flexible and non-sensitive. The e-newspaper combines the readability and overview from the printed newspaper with the possibilities of online media such as constant updates, interactivity and video, and is predicted to replace the printed edition in the long run. The introduction of the e-newspaper will most certainly affect the way the news is produced (Appelgren et al, 2004), distributed and consumed in the future. With the introduction of online newspapers a decade ago, the <b>newspaper</b> <b>firms</b> experienced both organizational and production challenges (Ihlström & Palmer, 2002) and the online newspapers indeed created new consumption habits (Aikat, 1998; Sundar, 1999). However, it {{has been difficult to}} find ways of profiting from the online ventures (Ihlström & Henfridsson, 2005), which partly depends on the infrastructure. Moreover, most <b>newspaper</b> <b>firms</b> nowadays offer several mobile services, such as SMS, MMS, and WAP, creating some revenue, but also in this context the infrastructure plays a role. After decades in the laboratory, e-paper technologies seem posed for commercialization starting as early as 2006 [1]. The e-paper technologies are developing rapidly, e. g. Hewlett-Packard is testing material to replace newsprint, and discusses a gadget that is very lightweight, very thin and potentially flexible. “The future newspaper could feature a plastic sheet display on which images and information can be uploaded, through either a wireless or USB connection. But creating a thinner, paperlike medium {{has proven to be a}} tougher challenge than making an e-book. ” [2].

40|$|Almost everywhere, the {{newspaper}} industry today is facing major transformations due mainly to increased competition, changes in consumer behaviour, and technological advancements. These factors {{are having an}} impact on the organisational structure and performance of <b>newspaper</b> <b>firms.</b> Managers likewise are face-to-face with new environmental conditions in terms of uncertainty and munificence. In the presence of these challenges, the literature on corporate entrepreneurship justifies a firm’s entrepreneurial behaviour {{in order to be able}} to detect and seize new opportunities. Although there seems to be sufficient proof of a positive relationship between being entrepreneurial and performance, there is no clear evidence in the literature regarding the extent these organisational and environmental factors may enhance or curb the effects that an entrepreneurial strategy-making mode might have on performance. This study examines the complexities of the relationship between an entrepreneurial strategy-making mode and the firm’s performance as it investigates the moderating effects of the organisational structure and environmental factors on {{the newspaper}} publishing industry. A mixed method research design is employed thus complementing the findings of quantitative analyses by means of exploring three newspaper case studies assessing the various dimensions of the entrepreneurial strategy-making mode. The results show that entrepreneurial newspapers attain better performance than non-entrepreneurial ones, particularly the ones that have developed proactiveness and an entrepreneurial culture as essential elements of their strategy-making mode. From a configurational perspective, performance is enhanced when entrepreneurial newspapers present a higher level of organisational integration and are prone to outsourcing various activities while facing low environmental munificence. Nevertheless, <b>newspaper</b> <b>firms</b> competing in munificent and less uncertain environments may perform well albeit lack of entrepreneurial behaviour. These findings and the novel research design employed contribute to strategic management, corporate entrepreneurship and media management fields of research...|$|R

40|$|Data {{obtained}} from a manufacturing firm and a <b>newspaper</b> <b>firm</b> in India were {{used to examine the}} relationship between organizational politics and procedural justice in three separate studies. Study 1 constructively replicated research on the distinctiveness of the two constructs. Confirmatory factor analyses in which data from the manufacturing firm served as the development sample and data from the <b>newspaper</b> <b>firm</b> served as the validation sample demonstrated the distinctiveness of organizational politics and procedural justice. Study 2 examined the antecedents of the two constructs using data from the manufacturing firm. Structural equation modeling (SEM) results revealed formalization and participation in decision making to be positively related to procedural justice but negatively related to organizational politics. Further, authority hierarchy and spatial distance were positively related to organizational politics but unrelated to procedural justice. Study 3 examined the consequences of the two constructs in terms of task and contextual performance using data from the <b>newspaper</b> <b>firm.</b> Results of SEM analysis revealed procedural justice but not organizational politics to be related to task performance and the contextual performance dimensions of interpersonal facilitation and job dedication. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we present the case study of a <b>newspaper</b> <b>firm</b> in order to analyse the impact of a recently introduced collaborative computer system, implemented to support the information search, storage, organisation and dissemination activities of organisational actors. We found that the implementation of the new groupware systems has revolutionised the process of creation of the newspapers and given more time and greater control to the Editorial team.

Measures of coopetition, freight consolidation, collaborative freight distribution, and sustainable distribution were embodied in a survey distributed to <b>newspaper</b> <b>firms,</b> transporters and newsagents in context of Thailand. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypothesized relationships.

40|$|The {{question}} of how ownership impacts {{on the performance of}} the press is a perennial one. Despite the extensive attention devoted to the perceived consequences of ownership, information about what newspaper owners actually do remains limited.

The article presents a study that focuses specifically on the decision-making in and around the boardrooms of three Swedish <b>newspaper</b> <b>firms</b> between 1955 and 2005. Building on analyses of board meeting minutes and interviews with board members, the study shows that the impact of ownership is established, and develops, in an intricate web of interacting forces, internal and external to the firm.

While circulation and readership of printed newspapers are dropping constantly and offer gloomy growth prospects, they remain the largest revenue source. Therefore, in order to explore growth in emerging businesses and still take advantage of the printed newspapers’ benefits, established <b>newspaper</b> <b>firms</b> need to focus on new business opportunities while simultaneously upholding the old business. This thesis is based on a case study at Göteborgs-Posten, a Gothenburg-based newspaper, where we investigated strategic and organizational issues related to the development of new business. The aim of the thesis is to explain how Göteborgs-Posten deals with the challenges of the coexistence of new and old business and the effects their response has on the organization’s ability to play multiple games at once. The empirical investigation shows a number of challenging aspects in this coexistence such as: short term perspectives in some new business development projects, difficulties to find a balance between the focus on old customers/markets and new customers/markets, inflexible overall organizational structure, historical duality management practices, and sub-cultures. Using theories from strategy and entrepreneurship we further discuss our findings, in order to highlight the specificities of this study as well as to propose relevant suggestions for this particular case.
