It has been argued, however, that in an environment with low <b>nominal</b> GDP growth, when <b>nominal</b> wage cuts become customary, workers' opposition to <b>nominal</b> cuts would erode and, hence, firms would no longer hesitate to reduce <b>nominal</b> pay. If this argument is valid <b>nominal</b> wage rigidities are largely irrelevant because in a high-growth environment there is little need to cut <b>nominal</b> pay while in a low-growth environment the necessary cuts would occur. To examine this argument we use data from Switzerland where <b>nominal</b> GDP growth has been very low {{for many years in}} the 1990 s. We find that the rigidity of <b>nominal</b> wages is a robust phenomenon that does not vanish in a low growth environment. In addition, it constitutes a considerable obstacle to real wage adjustment. In the absence of downward <b>nominal</b> rigidity, real wages would indeed be quite responsive to unemployment.

5|$|Like many Australian languages, Wagiman {{does not}} categorially {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives. These form one word class {{that is called}} <b>nominals.</b> Wagiman <b>nominals</b> take case suffixes (see below) that denote their grammatical or semantic role in the sentence. The grammatical cases are ergative and absolutive, and the semantic cases include instrumental (using), allative (towards), ablative (from), locative (at), comitative (with, having), privative (without, lacking), temporal (at the time of) and semblative (resembling). The dative case can be either grammatical or semantic, depending on the syntactic requirements of the verb.|$|E
5|$|When <b>nominals</b> {{are derived}} by {{reduplication}}, the added meaning is usually one of plurality. However, since both a dual and a plural nominal suffix exist, -giwu and -guju respectively, nominal reduplication is rare.|$|E
5|$|Demonstratives are {{similarly}} considered <b>nominals</b> in Wagiman, {{and take the}} same case suffixes depending on their semantic and syntactic roles; their function within the sentence. That is, the demonstrative mahan 'this', or 'here' (root: mayh-), may take case {{just like any other}} nominal.|$|E
50|$|A recent body of {{work has}} {{investigated}} the connections between <b>nominal</b> terms and higher-order patterns, and consequently between <b>nominal</b> unification and higher-order pattern unification. Cheney proposed an extension of <b>nominal</b> terms called <b>nominal</b> patterns. He then provided a translation between <b>nominal</b> patterns and higher-order patterns which preserved unifiers. Later, Levy and Villaret demonstrated a translation between <b>nominal</b> terms and higher-order patterns that preserves the notion of unifiability. That is, if two <b>nominal</b> terms are unifiable, then their translated pattern counterparts are also unifiable.|$|R

50|$|The <b>nominal</b> {{mass for}} an element is the mass {{number of its}} most {{abundant}} naturally occurring stable isotope, and for an ion or molecule, the <b>nominal</b> mass {{is the sum of}} the <b>nominal</b> masses of the constituent atoms. Isotope abundances are tabulated by IUPAC: for example carbon has two stable isotopes 12C at 98.9% natural abundance and 13C at 1.1% natural abundance, thus the <b>nominal</b> mass of carbon is 12. The <b>nominal</b> mass is not always the lowest mass number, for example iron has isotopes 54Fe, 56Fe, 57Fe, and 58Fe with abundances 6%, 92%, 10%, and 2%, respectively, and a <b>nominal</b> mass of 56. For a molecule, the <b>nominal</b> mass is obtained by summing the <b>nominal</b> masses of the constituent elements, for example water has two hydrogen atoms with <b>nominal</b> mass 1 and one oxygen atom with <b>nominal</b> mass 16, therefore the <b>nominal</b> mass of H2O is 18.|$|R
5|$|Further to derivational and inflectional morphemes, Wagiman coverbs and <b>nominals</b> often undergo reduplication, whereby a part, or {{often the}} {{entirety}} of the root, is repeated. Reduplication can convey a multitude of meanings. When coverbs are reduplicated, the resulting derived coverb may involve added meaning components such as iterativity, duration or habituality.|$|E
5|$|Wagiman is a prefixing language, which, in {{the context}} of {{typology}} of Australian languages, may refer to its genealogical classification as well as its syntactic properties. Wagiman, along with other Gunwinyguan languages, inflects verbs for person and number of the subject obligatorily, and optionally for the object. In this respect Wagiman displays characteristics of a head-marking language. However, Wagiman also behaves as a dependent-marking language, in that <b>nominals</b> are case marked as to their grammatical or semantic roles, such as ergative (the subject of a transitive clause) or absolutive (the object of a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause).|$|E
25|$|There are two nominal classes, Common <b>Nominals</b> (common nouns, demonstratives, locative/temporal/etc. adverbs) and Proper Nomals (Proper names , pronouns). The major {{difference}} between the two classes are 1) semantic — Proper <b>nominals</b> have pronominal characteristics, and, 2) declensional, for example Proper <b>Nominals</b> have one locative case rather than the three of Common <b>Nominals.</b>|$|E

25|$|Berkeley Construction Grammar (BCG: {{formerly}} also simply called Construction Grammar {{in upper}} case) {{focuses on the}} formal aspects of constructions and makes use of a unification-based framework for description of syntax, not unlike head-driven phrase structure grammar. Its proponents/developers include Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Laura Michaelis, and {{to a certain extent}} Ivan Sag. Immanent within BCG works like Fillmore and Kay 1995 and Michaelis and Ruppenhofer 2001 is the notion that phrasal representations—embedding relations—should not be used to represent combinatoric properties of lexemes or lexeme classes. For example, BCG abandons the traditional practice of using non-branching domination (NP over N' over N) to describe undetermined <b>nominals</b> that function as NPs, instead introducing a determination construction that requires ('asks for') a non-maximal nominal sister and a lexical 'maximality' feature for which plural and mass nouns are unmarked. BCG also offers a unification-based representation of 'argument structure' patterns as abstract verbal lexeme entries ('linking constructions'). These linking constructions include transitive, oblique goal and passive constructions. These constructions describe classes of verbs that combine with phrasal constructions like the VP construction but contain no phrasal information in themselves.|$|E
