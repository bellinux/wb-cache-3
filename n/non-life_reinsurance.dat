40|$|Notable in {{strategic}} management research is {{a paradigm shift}} from industry/market factors as determinants of competitive strategy to a resource-based view. This study focuses {{on the extent to}} which firms in the reinsurance industry use resources for strategic positioning and differentiation. A qualitative case study approach has been adopted for this study. On the basis of open-ended questions, interviews were conducted with 6 executives of the 6 chosen <b>non-life</b> <b>reinsurance</b> companies. In addition to interviews, company annual reports were used. Results obtained point to similarities in broader categorisation of resources, namely human capital, financial resources, information systems and organisational culture. Despite similarities in the broader grouping of resources, uniqueness in resources and competitive advantage derived therefrom is in the attributes of each of the resources that a reinsurance firm own. The main driver for basing positioning and differentiation strategies is that resources are controllable and manipulative compared to industry factors. Though the results support the underlying principles of the resource-based view, it is notable that its prescriptive nature with regard to resource characteristics, does not hold for some of the resources such as human resources, which are not perfectly immobile.

40|$|The {{changing}} {{business environment}} in <b>non-life</b> insurance and <b>reinsurance</b> {{has raised the}} need for new quantitative methods to analyze the impact of various types of strategic decisions on a company’s bottom line. Dynamic Financial Analysis («DFA») has become popular among practitioners as a means of addressing these new requirements. It is a systematic approach based on large-scale computer simulations for the integrated financial modeling of <b>non-life</b> insurance and <b>reinsurance</b> companies aimed at assessing the risks and the benefits associated with strategic decisions. DFA allows decision makers to understand and quantify the impact and interplay of the various risks that their company is exposed to, and – ultimately – to make better informed strategic decisions. In this brochure, we provide an overview and assessment {{of the state of the}} industry related to DFA. We investigate the DFA value proposition, we explain its elements and we explore its potential and limitations. reinsurance, dynamic financial analysis, insurance...|$|R
