40|$|Given his {{commitment}} to the project of <b>naturalizing</b> every normative aspect of philosophy; reducing its a priori content to some sort of empirical enterprise, Quine’s inroad into moral philosophy is expected to {{set the stage for the}} project of <b>naturalizing</b> ethics. However, Quine argues that ethics is methodologically infirmed. Hence, the hope of <b>naturalizing</b> ethics hits the rock. This paper aims at advancing the project of <b>naturalizing</b> ethics by an attempt to settle, in a way different from the postulations of Flanagan and White, foremost commentators on Quinean ethics, Quine’s charge of methodological infirmity...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the timing of}} naturalization for Chinese immigrants settling in New York City. Immigration helped sustain New York City population levels in the 1990 s. Chinese immigrants <b>naturalize</b> more quickly than other major groups, and they sponsor many family members under immediate relative provisions. Based on continuous-time hazard models over duration controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, immediate relatives of U. S. citizens and employment immigrants were <b>naturalizing</b> more quickly than immigrants under family preference categories since the mid 1980 s. For most cohorts, immigrants reporting professional, managerial, technical sales, or administrative occupations showed propensity to <b>naturalize</b> more quickly than others. The gender effect was inconsistent, although women of recent cohorts were <b>naturalizing</b> more quickly, perhaps due to changing gender roles. ...|$|R

5|$|Earlier, Cotillo {{had opposed}} the anti-immigration {{restrictions}} of the Immigration Act of 1924 that significantly limited immigration from Italy. In 1931, Cotillo protested against unnecessary stringent {{requirements of a}} proposed registration law, particularly the requirement of {{the equivalent of a}} public school education and the fingerprinting of applicants. A <b>naturalized</b> citizen had the same rights as native-born and fingerprinting would make the foreign applicant feel like a criminal, Cotillo pointed out. He referred to the findings of the Wickersham Commission that the foreign-born committed considerably less crime than native citizens. He also attacked the revocation of citizenship because of evil doing, while a native born was not affected. At the time, Cotillo claimed to have <b>naturalized</b> some 25,000 immigrants in the eight years he had been on the bench.|$|E
