30|$|Davidson et al. (2012) {{investigated}} a novel {{approach to}} inhibit the formation of wax on the solid surface through magnetically induced heating using superparamagnetic nanoparticles. The process of magnetically induced heating was described as “Neel Relaxation”. The process used was similar to what was used in biomedicine heating and burning cancerous tissues. Experiments were carried out using superparamagnetic nanoparticles (10  nm) dispersed in water and hydrocarbon fluid. For solids, the nanoparticles were embedded in a solid film called “nanopoint”. For a static fluid, the heat was generated in a linear proportion with the concentration of nanoparticles. It was also discovered that heat transfer from the <b>nanopoint</b> to the flowing fluid was three times greater compared to the static fluid. The suspension containing the superparamagnetic nanoparticles can be injected around the wellbore region and oil transportation pipelines. The application of the magnetically induced heating would reduce wax deposition or hydrate formation. Precipitation of asphaltene from crude oil can negatively affect crude oil production and transportation. This is can occur due to changes in pressure, temperature, and composition of the crude oil. Changes in composition often occur because of mixing of oil with injected solvent during EOR operations. It is therefore imperative to find an inhibitor, which can either prevent or delay the precipitation of asphaltene from crude oil. Mohammadi et al. (2011) investigated the effect of TiO 2, ZrO 2, and SiO 2 fine nanoparticles potentially stabilizing asphaltene particles in the oil. The authors’ titrated n-Heptane with dead oil samples obtained from Iranian oil reservoirs {{in the presence of}} the nanofluids. Polarized light microscopy was applied to determine the onset of asphaltene precipitation. It was discovered that TiO 2 nanoparticles could only effectively prevent asphaltene precipitation under acidic conditions compared to basic conditions. Using FTIR spectroscopy, TiO 2 nanoparticles prevented the precipitation of asphaltene through the formation of hydrogen bonds under acidic conditions. The other nanoparticles, ZrO 2, and SiO 2 were also observed to stabilize asphaltene nanoaggregates under acidic conditions through the formation of hydrogen bonds. Under basic conditions, the ZrO 2, and SiO 2 nanoparticles were unable to prevent the precipitation of asphaltene due to the inability to form hydrogen bonds. Nanoparticles prevent asphaltene precipitation through adsorption of the asphaltene molecules on its surface (Fig.  4). Asphaltene adsorption on nanoparticle surface has been reported to be affected by asphaltene content, temperature and contact time (Sun et al. 2017).|$|E
30|$|ZnO is an {{important}} semiconductor for optoelectronic applications due to its wide band gap (3.37  eV) and high exciton binding energy (60  meV) [1]. Various ZnO nanostructures, such as 1 D nanobelts [2], nanowires [3], <b>nanopoints</b> [4], nanorods [5], nanocables and nanotubes [6], 2 D nanowalls [7], and 3 D nanotowers [8], have been successfully synthesized. The morphologies and optoelectronic properties of ZnO nanostructures and ZnO films are controlled by adjusting their preparation conditions [8 – 27]. The crystallinities and morphologies of ZnO-based films have {{been the focus of}} many studies [9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, 21, 23 – 25], as these properties play important roles in device applications. Most ZnO films, including those grown by PLD [12], molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [24], MOCVD [25], and MS [13, 21, 22], have shown “particle-like” surface morphologies. Unconventional surface morphologies, such as networked nanostructures, nanosheets, columnar nanorods [28], and maize corn seed-like morphologies [29], have also been reported. In 2009, Sekine et al. reported that ZnO films with nanoridge surface morphologies showed a high power conversion efficiency improvement of approximately 25 % over similar solar cells consisting of planar ZnO nanoparticle films [19]. Banal et al. investigated the formation mechanism of this ridge structure in an AlN/sapphire system and found that the AlN ridge structure formed because of the enhanced migration of Al atoms by an alternating source supply [30]. In addition to the surface structures, the crystallinities and optoelectronic properties of ZnO films have been discussed in several studies [9, 11, 22, 29, 31 – 33], in which, doping, adding buffer layers, and post-annealing have been reported to be beneficial to improve the properties of ZnO films. In this work, we report the formation of ridge-structured ZnO films by designing an extra interfacial layer and tailoring the initial growth conditions in MBE on MgO(111) substrates. These characteristics have been seldom observed previously for ZnO films grown by MBE. MgO(111) was chosen as a substrate due to its similar hexagonal structure to the ZnO(0001) plane. Additionally, MgO(111) is often used as a buffer layer for high-quality ZnO growth [32, 33].|$|R
