After incubation of slCr-labelled rat islet cells with islet cell surface antibody, human AB·type serum with or without <b>nafamostat</b> mesylate was added before further incubation. Radioactivity in the supernatant was measured to determine complement-dependent antibody-mediated cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity in untreated sera [mean (± SD) 19. 4 ± 4. 0 %] was significantly (P < 0. 001) inhibited by ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid (EGTA) (7. 1 ± 4. 9 %), ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (2. 5 ± 0. 9 %) and <b>nafamostat</b> mesylate (2. 8 ± 1. 8 %). Cytotoxicity of <b>nafamostat</b> mesylate-treated serum was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than that ofEGTA-treated serum but {{not significantly different from}} that of EDTA-treated serum. There was no difference in cytotoxicity between <b>nafamostat</b> mesylate-treated and untreated, inactivated human serum.

40|$|Intravenous {{injection}} of ioxaglate (4 g iodine kg− 1), an iodinated radiographic contrast medium, caused a marked protein extravasation, pulmonary oedema and {{a decrease in}} the arterial partial oxygen pressure in rats. All of these reactions to ioxaglate were reversed by the pretreatment with gabexate mesilate (10 and 50 mg kg− 1, 5 min prior to injection) or <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate (3 and 10 mg kg− 1), in which the inhibition was complete after {{injection of}} <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate (10 mg kg− 1). Both gabexate mesilate and <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate inhibited the activity of purified human lung tryptase, although the latter compound was far more potent than the former. Ioxaglate enhanced the nafamostat-sensitive protease activity in the extracellular fluid of rat peritoneal mast cell suspensions. Tryptase enhanced the permeability of protein through the monolayer of cultured human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. Ioxaglate, when applied in combination with rat peritoneal mast cells, also produced the endothelial barrier dysfunction. These effects of tryptase and ioxaglate were reversed by <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate. Consistent with these findings, immunofluorescence morphological analysis revealed that tryptase or ioxaglate in combination with mast cells increased actin stress fibre formation while decreasing VE-cadherin immunoreactivity. Both of these actions of tryptase and ioxaglate were reversed by <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate.

The patients were divided into a control group (n = 10) and a <b>nafamostat</b> group (n = 10). <b>Nafamostat</b> (2 mg/kg per hour) was continuously given during cardiopulmonary bypass in the <b>nafamostat</b> group. The age, number of grafts, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and aortic crossclamp time were similar between groups. In the control group, neither tumor necrosis factor-α nor interleukin- 1 levels showed any significant change during cardiopulmonary bypass, whereas interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 8 levels, percent expression of adhesion molecule (CD 18) on neutrophils, and CH 50 assay results increased significantly during cardiopulmonary bypass. As compared with the control group, the <b>nafamostat</b> group showed significantly lower levels of interleukin- 6 (123 ± 57 versus 40 ± 22 pg/ml, respectively) and interleukin- 8 (96 ± 13 versus 66 ± 14 pg/ml, respectively). The <b>nafamostat</b> group showed a significantly lower difference of CH 50 assay results and malondialdehyde levels between coronary sinus blood and arterial blood and peak values of creatine kinase MB (43 ± 12 IU/L versus 19 ± 6 IU/L) during the postoperative course compared with findings in the control group. These results demonstrated that inflammatory reactions induced by cardiopulmonary bypass had adverse effects on myocardial recovery after aortic crossclamping and that <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate given during cardiopulmonary bypass appeared to reduce myocardial reperfusion injury by attenuating such inflammatory reactions.

However, the role of heparin anticoagulation, {{which is used to}} maintain circuit patency, is equivocal due to the risk of bleeding and morbidity. Among various alternative anticoagulants, <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate {{has been shown to be}} an effective anticoagulant in patients prone to bleeding. Hence, we conducted a prospective, randomized controlled study investigating the effect of <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate on mortality, CRRT filter life span and adverse events in patients with bleeding tendency. Seventy-three Patients were randomized into either the futhan or no-anticoagulation group. Thirty-six subjects in the futhan group received <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate, while thirty seven subjects in the no-anticoagulation group received no anticoagulants. Baseline characteristics and appropriate laboratory tests were taken from each group. The mortality between the two groups was not significantly different. Nevertheless, between the futhan group and the no-anticoagulation group, the overall number of filters used during CRRT (2. 71 ± 2. 12 vs. 4. 50 ± 3. 25; p = 0. 042) and the number of filters changed due to clots per 24 hours (1. 15 ± 0. 81 vs. 1. 74 ± 1. 62; p = 0. 040) were significantly different. When filter life span was subdivided into below and over 12 hours, the number of filters functioning over 12 hours was significantly higher in the futhan group than in the no-anticoagulation group (p = 0. 037, odds ratio 1. 84).

40|$|The {{origin of}} blood loss during liver surgery is multifactorial. Surgical skill, technique, anesthesiological care, but also hyperfibrinolysis {{have been shown}} {{to play a role in}} the origin of {{bleeding}} during partial hepatectomy and liver transplantation. The latter has provided the scientific basis for the prophylactic use of antifibrinolytic drugs, such as aprotinin and <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate in liver surgery. Recently however, concern has been voiced about potential risks associated with aprotinin, including renal failure and thromboembolic events. In this review we discuss the efficacy and safety issues of aprotinin and <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate in liver surgery. We identified a total of 19 studies on the use of either aprotinin or <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate in liver surgery reported in the time period between 1966 and July 2006. The use of aprotinin or <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate in partial hepatectomies was studied in three studies. In 16 studies the use of aprotinin in liver transplantation was investigated. With respect to partial hepatectomy, improvements in surgical technique and anesthesiological care seem to be more important in reducing blood loss than the use of the antifibrinolytic drugs. Aprotinin may be indicated in a selected group of patients with cirrhosis undergoing liver resection, but further studies in this specific group of patients will be needed. In liver transplantation, the use of aprotinin is associated with a significant reduction in blood loss and transfusion requirements of around 30 - 40 %. Results of prospective studies do not provide support for safety concerns as no increased risk for thromboembolic events or renal dysfunction has been observed in liver transplant patients treated with aprotinin. In conclusion, there is currently no scientific support for the routine use of aprotinin or <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate in patients undergoing partial hepatectomy, whereas the efficacy of aprotinin in liver transplantation is well established. More studies will be needed to address the safety aspects of aprotinin in patients undergoing liver surgery in more detail. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E

40|$|Background: Cardiac {{mast cell}} (MC) proteases, chymase and tryptase, {{increase}} proliferation and collagen synthesis in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. However, {{the question as}} to why preventing individually the actions of either protease prevents fibrosis when both are released upon MC activation remains unanswered. Since tryptase has the ability to activate MCs in noncardiac tissues via the protease-activated receptor- 2 (PAR- 2), there is the possibility that its, in vivo, fibrotic role is due to its ability to induce MC degranulation thereby amplifying the release of chymase. Methods: This study sought to delineate the interactions between tryptase and chymase in myocardial remodeling secondary to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 5  weeks in male Sprague–Dawley rats untreated or treated with either the tryptase inhibitor, <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate or MC membrane stabilizing drug, nedocromil (n =  6 /group). In addition, ventricular slices from 6 rat hearts were incubated with tryptase, tryptase plus <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate or the chymase inhibitor chymostatin for 24  h. Results and conclusion: The results indicate the presence of PAR- 2 on MCs and that tryptase inhibition and nedocromil prevented TAC-induced fibrosis and increases in MC density, activation, and chymase release. Tryptase also significantly increased chymase concentration in ventricular slice culture media, which was prevented by the tryptase inhibitor. Hydroxyproline concentration in culture media was significantly increased with tryptase incubation as compared to the control group and the tryptase group incubated with <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate or chymostatin. We conclude that tryptase contributes to TAC-induced cardiac fibrosis primarily via activation of MCs and the amplified release of chymase...|$|E

We sought to identify the factors that affect outcomes of ECLS for postoperative LCOS. MethodsFrom 2005 to 2011, of a total of 9267 adult patients underwent major cardiac surgery, 93 patients (aged, 60. 6  ±  13. 8 years; 47 women) underwent ECLS to treat postoperative LCOS. ResultsThirty-nine (41. 9 %) patients were weaned off ECLS successfully, and 1 patient underwent heart transplantation. A final total of 23 patients (24. 3 %), including 1 heart transplantation recipient, survived until the end of the follow-up period (median, 611 days; range, 125 - 2247 days). On logistic regression analysis, old age (P =. 001), a high blood lactate level before ECLS initiation (P < . 001), cardiopulmonary bypass weaning failure after surgery (P < . 001), and postoperative bleeding (P = . 012) were independent factors associated with mortality. In contrast, administration of anticoagulant <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate (P = . 040) was found to be associated with improved outcomes of ECLS. When the predictive value of pre-ECLS blood lactate level for mortality was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve, the greatest accuracy was obtained at the cutoff value of 7. 9 mmol/L, with 63 % sensitivity and 68 % specificity. ConclusionsHigh lactate level before ECLS is an independent predictor of mortality after ECLS, necessitating earlier ECLS implementations before profound lactic acidosis develops. Moreover, <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate should be considered as alternative to heparin {{to reduce the risk of}} bleeding in these high-risk patients...|$|E

When the in ovo antiviral activity of the compounds was tested by using chicken embryos, camostat mesilate at a dose of 10 micrograms/g markedly reduced the hemagglutinin titers of influenza viruses A and B...|$|E
3000|$|Descriptive {{statistics}} are presented for all patients and propensity score-weighted [inverse probability of treatment (IPT) weighting] groups. Based on the estimated propensity {{scores for each}} patient, we performed IPT-weighted analyses for the low-dose corticosteroid and control groups [31 – 33]. To estimate the propensity score, we fitted a logistic regression model for undergoing low-dose corticosteroid treatment {{as a function of}} patient demographics and medication or interventions performed on days 0 or 1. We included the following: age; sex; hospital type (academic or nonacademic) and volume; consciousness level; coexisting diseases; blood culture test performed; intermittent hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy after admission; postoperative polymyxin B hemoperfusion; type of catecholamine used; vasopressin used; initial use of two or more antibiotics and each type of initial antibiotic administered; drugs for disseminated intravascular coagulation (antithrombin, thrombomodulin, gabexate mesilate, <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate, or ulinastatin); use of intravenous immunoglobulin, albumin, or sivelestat sodium; and blood transfusion [24 – 27, 33]. We used IPT as the weights based on the propensity score; we did so to create a synthetic sample, in which the distribution of measured baseline covariates was independent of treatment assignment [31 – 33]. We defined the weights as follows: W [...]...|$|E
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of more challenging targets, a relatively new approach, fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), proved its efficacy and gained increasing importance in the pharmaceutical industry. FBDD identifies low molecular-weight (MW) ligands (fragments) that bind to biologically important macromolecules, then a structure-guided fragment growing or merging approach is performed, contributing {{to the quality of}} the lead. However, to select the appropriate fragment to be evolved, sensitive analytical screening methods must be used to measure the affinity in the muM or even mM range. In this particular context, we developed a robust and selective partial filling affinity CE (ACE) method for the direct binding screening of a small fragment library in order to identify new thrombin inhibitors. To demonstrate the accuracy of our assay, the complex dissociation constants of three known thrombin inhibitors, namely benzamidine, p-aminobenzamidine and <b>nafamostat</b> were determined and found to be in good concordance with the previously reported values. Finally, the screening of a small library was performed and demonstrated the high discriminatory power of our method towards weak binders compared to classical spectrophotometric activity assay, proving the interest of our method in the context of FBDD.

Preoperative examination for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) occasionally reveals an abnormal decrease in coagulation factors and thrombocytopenia, fulfilling the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Treatment of the underlying disorder is indispensable for alleviating DIC. We report an uncommon case of a patient with AAA and DIC who showed prolonged thrombocytopenia despite successful treatment of AAA and temporary recovery of coagulation factors. A 70 -year-old man presented with AAA and shaggy aorta accompanied by DIC and underwent aneurysmectomy. Combined preoperative use of <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate and recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin was effective in controlling DIC. Although recovery of coagulation factors was observed after surgery, the thrombocytopenia continued throughout the postoperative course and was refractory to platelet transfusion. Because HPA antibody and PA-IgG were present, a trial administration of γ-globulin was performed; this resulted in rapid improvement of thrombocytopenia. Although DIC recurred again 2 weeks thereafter, coagulation factors subsequently recovered without any medication. 1...|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic {{cancer is}} a highly lethal {{malignancy}} {{and one of the}} leading causes of cancer-related death. During the development and progression of cancer, tumor angiogenesis plays a crucial role. A great deal of evidence has revealed that human mast cells (MCs) contributed to tumor angiogenesis through releasing several pro-angiogenetic factors, among which tryptase {{is one of the most}} active. However, the role of mast cell tryptase (MCT) in human pancreatic cancer angiogenesis is still not well documented. In this study, we examined the MCT levels in serum from pancreatic cancer patients and evaluated the correlationship of the MCT level and tumor angiogenesis. In addition, the effect of MCT on endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation was investigated both in vitro and in nude mice bearing pancreatic tumor. It was found that MCT contributes to endothelial cell growth and tube formation via up-regulation of angiopoietin- 1 expression. Moreover, using the MCT inhibitor <b>nafamostat,</b> tryptase-induced angiogenesis was obviously suppressed both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that MCT plays an important role in pancreatic cancer angiogenesis and tumor growth via activating the angiopoietin- 1 pathway, and tryptase inhibitors may be evaluated as an effective anti-angiogenetic approach in pancreatic cancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background. Angiogenesis is {{a complex}} process {{involved}} in both growth and progression of several human and animal tumours. Tryptase is a serin protease stored in mast cells granules, which {{plays a role in}} tumour angiogenesis. Mast cells (MCs) can release tryptase following c-Kit receptor (c-KitR) activation. Method. In a series of 25 gastric cancer patients with stage T 3 N 2 - 3 M 0 (by AJCC for Gastric Cancer 7 th Edition), immunohistochemistry and image analysis methods were employed to evaluate in the tumour tissue the correlation between the number of mast cells positive to tryptase (MCPT), c-KitR expressing cells (c-KitR-EC), and microvascular density (MVD). Results. Data demonstrated a positive correlation between MCPT, c-KitR-EC, and MVD to each other. In tumour tissue the mean number of MCPT was 15, the mean number of c-KitR-EC was 20, and the mean number of MVD was 20. The Pearson test correlating MCPT and MVD, c-KitR-EC and MVD was significantly (r= 0. 64, P= 0. 001; r= 0. 66, P= 0. 041, resp.). Conclusion. In this pilot study, we suggest that MCPT and c-KitR-EC play a role in gastric cancer angiogenesis, so we think that several c-KitR or tryptase inhibitors such as gabexate mesilate and <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate might be evaluated in clinical trials as a new antiangiogenetic approach...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} {{is rare in}} pregnancy, with {{an estimated}} incidence of approximately 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10, 000 pregnancies. Acute pancreatitis in pregnancy usually occurs in the third trimester. Here, we report a case of acute pancreatitis in the first trimester. A 36 -year-old primigravida at 11 weeks of gestation complained of severe lower abdominal pain. The pain gradually worsened and migrated toward the epigastric region. She had no history of chronic alcoholism. Blood investigations showed elevated level of C-reactive protein (9. 58 [*]mg/dL), pancreatic amylase (170 [*]IU/L), and lipase (332 [*]IU/L). There was no gallstone and no abnormality in the pancreatic and biliary ducts on ultrasonography. Antinuclear antibody and IgG 4 were negative and no evidence of hyperlipidemia or diabetes was found. There was also no evidence of viral infection. On {{the third day of}} hospitalization, she was diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis on magnetic resonance imaging. Medical interventions were initiated with <b>nafamostat</b> mesilate and ulinastatin, and parenteral nutrition was administered through a central venous catheter. On the eighth day of hospitalization, her condition gradually improved with a decreased level of pancreatic amylase and the pain subsided. After conservative management, she did not have any recurrence during her pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|Angiogenesis is {{a complex}} process finely {{regulated}} by the balance between angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitors. As a result of proangiogenic factors overexpression, it {{plays a crucial role}} in cancer development. Although initially mast cells (MCs) role has been defined in hypersensitivity reactions and in immunity, it has been discovered that MCs have a crucial interplay on the regulatory function between inflammatory and tumor cells through the release of classical proangiogenic factors (e. g., vascular endothelial growth factor) and nonclassical proangiogenic mediators granule-associated (mainly tryptase). In fact, in several animal and human malignancies, MCs density is highly correlated with tumor angiogenesis. In particular, tryptase, an agonist of the proteinase-activated receptor- 2 (PAR- 2), represents {{one of the most powerful}} angiogenic mediators released by human MCs after c-Kit receptor activation. This protease, acting on PAR- 2 by its proteolytic activity, has angiogenic activity stimulating both human vascular endothelial and tumor cell proliferation in paracrine manner, helping tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Based on literature data it is shown that tryptase may represent a promising target in cancer treatment due to its proangiogenic activity. Here we focused on molecular mechanisms of three tryptase inhibitors (gabexate mesylate, <b>nafamostat</b> mesylate, and tranilast) in order to consider their prospective role in cancer therapy...|$|E
