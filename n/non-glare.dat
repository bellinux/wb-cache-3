25|$|The 1968 {{models were}} treated to a modest restyle of the trim, grille, and taillamps. New {{mandates}} by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for all 1968 model passenger cars were incorporated. Safety equipment including separate shoulder harness for the front seat belts, two rear lap belts, lighted side markers, padded seat backs, <b>non-glare</b> finish, safety design handles and armrests, energy absorbing steering column and optional headrests. American Motors did not wait for the requirements to cars delivered to dealers after 31 December 1967, but incorporated the safety features starting with the early 1968 model year cars produced in late 1967. Other requirements caused increases {{to the price of}} all cars manufactured after 1 January 1968, including exhaust control systems to help reduce unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions.|$|E
2500|$|Glock Ges.m.b.H., an Austrian {{firearms}} manufacturer, {{utilized the}} Tenifer process until 2010, {{to protect the}} barrels and slides of the pistols they manufacture. The finish on a Glock pistol is {{the third and final}} hardening process. [...] It is [...] thick and produces a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating via a [...] nitride bath. [...] The final matte, <b>non-glare</b> finish meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications, is 85% more corrosion resistant than a hard chrome finish, and is 99.9% salt-water corrosion resistant. After the Tenifer process, a black Parkerized finish is applied and the slide is protected even if the finish were to wear off. In 2010 Glock switched to a gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing process. Besides Glock several other pistol manufacturers, including Smith & Wesson and Springfield Armory, Inc., also use ferritic nitrocarburizing for finishing parts like barrels and slides but they call it Melonite finish. Heckler & Koch use a nitrocarburizing process they refer to as Hostile Environment. Pistol manufacturer Caracal International L.L.C. uses ferritic nitrocarburizing for finishing parts such as barrels and slides with the plasma-based Plasox process.|$|E

40|$|One {{approach}} {{in the design of}} sustainable products is the transfer of evolutional principles of nature into technical applications. This was applied in the development of an innovative technology based on the principle of material structuring through self-organization. It led to a manufacturing process that requires less energy through modified forming. The process is gentle to the surface and the material itself. Flat thin materials are transformed into a third dimension. These so called “vault-structured ” sheet metals open new chances for the process of designing sustainable products in the sense of fewer resources for more functionality. Improved stiffness of the sheets reduces the required sheet thickness and allows light-weight constructions. Furthermore beneficial properties of the buckled material include better stability in the case of stresses by thermal expansion, improved convective heat transfer during fluid flow over the vault-structured surface, reduced impact sound, better fluid dynamic characteristics and <b>non-glaring</b> light-reflection. The advantages of vault-structured sheet metals have already been exploited in various products. Examples for products using the lightweight material are automotive body parts and a thin-walled can partially made of structured material. In a drum for a washing machine the material’s high form rigidity is combined with advantageous flow behavior of the water along the vault-structured surface. At DESY, the “HERA ” electron synchrotron with an extremely thin-walled detector tube, profits from the thermal expansion properties. Vault-structured sheet metals have also been applied to improve the light-reflection characteristics of a fluorescent lamp.

50|$|The 400-watt {{metal halide}} fixture and fiber optic {{illuminating}} boxes require a bulb change every 1 to 2 years. The acrylic surfaces which face the window are cleaned with a non-abrasive cloth {{and a standard}} window cleaner. Clear fishing line is placed across the openings in the surfaces to deter birds from entering the space and clear <b>non-glare</b> acrylic panels can be {{placed in front of}} each kaleidoscope to protect the internal space even further.|$|E
5000|$|Special purpose models may be {{equipped}} {{with a variety of}} specialty parts which may include adjustable stock, [...] "Speedfeed" [...] stock that holds 4 additional rounds of ammunition, pistol grip, ghost ring and fiber optic sights, picatinny rail, forearm band, heatshield, ported barrel, muzzle brake, and even a bayonet lug. All special purpose models come only in black trim with either blued, <b>non-glare</b> matte blue, or parkerized finishes and come with drilled and tapped receivers for scope and optics mounting.|$|E
50|$|After heat {{treatment}} the metal parts are {{finished with a}} proprietary nitriding process called Tenifer Plus+. This finish is characterized by extreme wear and corrosion resistance; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth. The Tenifer Plus+ process produces a matte gray-colored, <b>non-glare</b> surface with a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 1,200-1,300 N/mm2 tensile strength. This finish makes the HS2000 particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed, as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.|$|E
50|$|The {{slide and}} other metal {{parts of the}} pistol are Tenifer treated (a {{nitriding}} process also used on Glock pistols). The Tenifer finish is between 0.04 mm and 0.05 mm in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth. The Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, <b>non-glare</b> surface with a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications), making the P99 particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.|$|E
50|$|Matrix LED {{digitally}} controlled adaptive <b>non-glare</b> highbeam multi-LED headlamps. The highbeam comprises 25 individual {{light-emitting diodes}} per unit {{that can be}} switched on and off or dimmed individually depending on the situation. This enables the headlight system to react accurately to other vehicles while still brightly illuminating {{the rest of the}} road. Additional features of the new headlights are the intelligent cornering light, new-look daytime running lights and dynamic turn signals. The lighting system uses predictive route data from the navigation system to adjust the distribution of light in response to the current driving situation. In combination with the optional Navigation plus with MMI touch, the system recognizes route data contained in the navigation system, such as curves and road classifications.|$|E
50|$|In {{its last}} years, Cinema Products was still innovative. A film to HD video {{transfer}} machine was introduced, novel {{in that the}} HD camera {{was not part of}} the transfer machine but mounted on it. An upgrade would be easy, just change the HD camera, the film transport deck stayed the same. A fiber optic-based 35 mm ground glass to video chip reducer was patented and sold to a competitor. A consumer-oriented Steadicam unit designed for small mini DV cameras was added to the Steadicam line. The Steadicam Jr. incorporated an 8-layer <b>non-glare</b> LCD video monitor comparable to the professional Steadicam rigs. The Steadicam line became the company's leading marketable product. Tiffen Filter bought the rights to make the Steadicam when Cinema Products Corporation went out of business in 2000.|$|E
50|$|In 1935, B.E. Jack and Bert Sloan {{proposed}} {{the construction of}} a large Star of Bethlehem on the side of Sundance Mountain in Palmer Lake. The five-pointed star, measuring 457 ft across and consisting of 91, 40-watt <b>non-glare</b> bulbs, is lit for the month of December and for other special occasions. Construction on the project was a community effort. The property on Sundance Mountain where the star was constructed was owned by Art and Reba Bradley, who donated the property to Palmer Lake in 1966. When Mrs. Bradley died in 1979, her estate provided funds to the Palmer Lake Fire Department for the maintenance of the star. In 1976, the star was completely rebuilt with new cable and steel pole in concrete as part of an American Revolutionary bicentennial project.|$|E
50|$|The pistol {{frame is}} made out of Zytel polymer {{reinforced}} with a stainless steel chassis. The pistol comes with three removable and interchangeable grips.The slide and barrel are made out of stainless steel that after hardening is treated with a proprietary nitriding process called Melonite. The Melonite process produces a matte gray <b>non-glare</b> surface with a 68 Rockwell C surface hardness rating.The pistol has a very low slide profile which holds the barrel axis close to the shooter's hand and makes the M&P more comfortable to shoot by reducing muzzle rise and allowing for faster aim recovery in rapid shooting sequence.The slide has four contact points with the frame. This was done to make the rail system self cleaning, by leaving room for any dirt or small foreign objects to fall out of the weapon.|$|E
50|$|The {{slide and}} other metal {{parts of the}} pistol are Tenifer treated (a {{ferritic}} nitrocarburizing process also used on Glock pistols). The Tenifer finish is between 0.04 mm and 0.05 mm in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth. The Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, <b>non-glare</b> surface with a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating (by comparison, an industrial diamond has a rating of 70 HRC) and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications), making the PPS particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.|$|E
50|$|The 1968 {{models were}} treated to a modest restyle of the trim, grille, and taillamps. New {{mandates}} by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for all 1968 model passenger cars were incorporated. Safety equipment including separate shoulder harness for the front seat belts, two rear lap belts, lighted side markers, padded seat backs, <b>non-glare</b> finish, safety design handles and armrests, energy absorbing steering column and optional headrests. American Motors did not wait for the requirements to cars delivered to dealers after 31 December 1967, but incorporated the safety features starting with the early 1968 model year cars produced in late 1967. Other requirements caused increases {{to the price of}} all cars manufactured after 1 January 1968, including exhaust control systems to help reduce unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions.|$|E
5000|$|Changes for 1968 were {{relatively}} subtle. The park and turn {{lights in the}} grille were moved slightly inboard and made round. Side marker lights {{were added to the}} front fenders and rear quarter panels, to comply with newly introduced Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108. Shoulder harnesses (separate, this year and until 1973, from the lap belts) and <b>non-glare</b> matte finish on the windshield wiper arms were also part of the 1968 federally mandated safety package. Chrysler's [...] "Clean Air Package" [...] emission control system became standard equipment on cars sold in all 50 states. The steering linkage was revised again, as were the windshield and rear window gaskets and trim-lock strips, leaving the 1967 pieces as one-year-only items. The standard rear axle ratio was dropped from 2.93 to 2.76 with all standard-performance engines and automatic transmission. Part-throttle downshift functionality was added as a refinement to the TorqueFlite automatic transmission in 6-cylinder cars, to retain acceptable city performance with the taller rear axle ratio.|$|E
5000|$|The action {{design is}} a self-loading, {{straight}} blowback operation, with right-side ejection. The receiver top has a serrated, <b>non-glare</b> finish. The receiver {{is held in}} the stock by front and rear machine screws through forearm and the trigger guard respectively (later models add a wood screw behind the trigger guard to reinforce the wrist of the stock). The receiver is grooved for a scope mount. For use without a scope, the barrel features an adjustable open rear sight and a ramp front sight. The charging handle is used to load the first round from the magazine and can be retracted and pushed in as a manual bolt hold-open feature. Current model has an automatic [...] "last-shot" [...] bolt hold-open device with an external lever {{in the front of}} the trigger guard to release the bolt. Earliest Model 60s did not have a bolt hold-open; first the manual, then in the mid-1980s the automatic [...] "last shot" [...] hold-open were added. The rifle has an easily accessible cross-bolt safety located above the trigger. When disassembled, the trigger guard with trigger and safety remains in the stock.|$|E

5000|$|The Calais was {{extensively}} restyled for 1967. Prominent styling {{features were}} given a powerful frontal appearance with [...] "forward-leaning" [...] front end, long sculptured body lines, and redefined rear fenders that had {{more than just a}} hint of tail fins in them. The full-width forward-thrust [...] "eggcrate" [...] grille was flanked by dual stacked headlights for the third consecutive year. The squarer cornered grille insert had blades that seemed to emphasize its vertical members and it appeared both above the bumper and through a horizontal slot cut into it. Rectangular parking lamps were built into the outer edges of the grille. Rear end styling revisions were highlighted by metal divided taillamps and a painted lower bumper section. For 1967, power windows became standard on the Calais line, although power seats were still optional even in the later-year models. Coupes got a new roofline, inspired by the Florentine show car created for the 1964 New York World's Fair, that gave rear seat passengers added privacy. As on that show car, the quarter window glass retracted rearward into a sail panel. New standard Calais features included <b>non-glare</b> rear-view mirror, electric clock, Automatic Climate Controls, padded dashboard, Hazard Warning system, outboard seatbelt retractors and rear cigarette lighters in all styles. A slide-out fuse box and safety front seat back lock for two-door models were additional Cadillac advances for the 1967 model year. Technical improvements included a revised engine valve train, different carburetor, Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts, and a new engine fan with clutch for quieter operation. An energy absorbing steering column became optional. 1967 was the last model year for pillared sedans.|$|E

40|$|A driving {{simulator}} {{was used to}} investigate the effects of simulated glare from the sun on the execution of left-turns at an intersection. The presence of glare resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} the safety margin used by drivers (by 0. 65 sec on average). The effect of glare was larger for low-contrast than for highcontrast oncoming vehicles. Older drivers (45 - 60 years) had a significantly greater reduction in safety margin compared to younger drivers (19 - 29 years), however, there was large inter-driver variability in both age groups. Older drivers adopted a larger safety margin in <b>non-glare</b> conditions with the result that the net effect of glare on driving safety was the same for both age groups. It is proposed that the reduction in retinal image contrast caused by glare caused drivers to overestimate the time to collision with oncoming cars...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} visual {{function}} after micro-incision ultrasonic emulsification combine with aspheric intraocular lens implantation for cataract patient. METHODS: A total of 50 cases(63 eyes) with age-related cataract were randomly divided into the experimental group(25 cases, 33 eyes) and a control group(25 cases, 30 eyes). Two groups {{of patients with}} operation method were same, the experimental group implantation of aspheric intraocular lens, control group with spherical intraocular lens implantation. Uncorrected visual acuity, best corrected visual acuity were compared, and two groups contrast sensitivity and wavefront aberration were checked. RESULTS:After 1 wk, 1 and 3 mo, two groups of patients with uncorrected visual acuity was no significant difference(P > 0. 05). Three months after surgery, {{there were no significant}} differences in best corrected visual acuity compared the two groups(P > 0. 05). In the <b>non-glare</b> and glare condition, the patients in the two groups at 3. 0, 6. 0, 12. 0, 18. 0 cd frequency contrast sensitivity difference was no significant(P > 0. 05); In the 1. 5 cd band, the experimental group contrast sensitivity was significantly higher than that of the control group(P P CONCLUSION: Aspheric intraocular lens in the low frequency contrast sensitivity is significantly better than the spherical intraocular lens, and can reduce the total aberration in cataract patients, so as to improve the postoperative visual function in cataract patients...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the positive effects}} of blue-violet light filtering lenses in delaying myopia and relieving asthenopia in juveniles. METHODS: Sixty ametropia juveniles (aged range, 11 - 15 y) were randomized into two groups: the test group (30 children, 60 eyes), wearing blue-violet light filtering lenses; and the control group (30 children, 60 eyes), wearing ordinary aspherical lenses. Baseline refractive power of the affected eyes and axial length of the two groups was recorded. After 1 -year, the patients underwent contrast sensitivity (glare and <b>non-glare</b> under bright and dark conditions), accommodation-related testing, asthenopia questionnaire assessment, and adverse reaction questionnaire assessment. RESULTS: After 1 y of wearing the filtering lenses, changes in refractive power and axial length were not significantly different between the two groups (P> 0. 05). Under bright conditions, the contrast sensitivities at low and medium-frequency grating (vision angles of 6. 3 °, 4. 0 °, and 2. 5 °) with glare in the test group were significantly higher than in the control group (P 0. 05). In the test group, the amplitude of accommodation, accommodative lag, and accommodative sensitivity of patients wearing glasses for 6 and 12 mo were significantly elevated (P 0. 05), and the asthenopia grating was not significantly decreased (P> 0. 05). In addition, after wearing glasses for 6 to 12 mo, the asthenopia grating of patients in the test group decreased significantly compared with the control group (P 0. 05). CONCLUSION: A 1 -year follow-up reveal that compare with ordinary glasses, short-wavelength filtering lenses (blue/violet-light filters) increase the low- and medium-frequency contrast sensitivity under bright conditions and improved accommodation. They effectively relieved asthenopia without severe adverse reactions, suggesting potential for clinical application. However, no significant advantages in terms of refractive power or axial length progression were found compared with ordinary aspheric lenses...|$|E
