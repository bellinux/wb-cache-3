40|$|Gaze {{tracking}} systems usually utilize near-infrared (<b>NIR)</b> <b>lights</b> and <b>NIR</b> cameras, {{and the performance}} of such systems is mainly affected by external light sources that include NIR components. This is ascribed to the production of additional (imposter) corneal specular reflection (SR) caused by the external light, which makes it difficult to discriminate between the correct SR as caused by the NIR illuminator of the gaze tracking system and the imposter SR. To overcome this problem, a new method is proposed for determining the correct SR in the presence of external light based on the relationship between the corneal SR and the pupil movable area with the relative position of the pupil and the corneal SR.

5000|$|... fNIR is a {{non-invasive}} {{imaging method}} involving the quantification of chromophore concentration resolved from {{the measurement of}} near infrared (<b>NIR)</b> <b>light</b> attenuation, temporal or phasic changes. NIR spectrum light {{takes advantage of the}} optical window in which skin, tissue, and bone are mostly transparent to <b>NIR</b> <b>light</b> in the spectrum of 700-900 nm, while hemoglobin (Hb) and deoxygenated-hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) are stronger absorbers of light. Differences in the absorption spectra of deoxy-Hb and oxy-Hb allow the measurement of relative changes in hemoglobin concentration through the use of light attenuation at multiple wavelengths. Two or more wavelengths are selected, with one wavelength above and one below the isosbestic point of 810 nm at which deoxy-Hb and oxy-Hb have identical absorption coefficients. Using the modified Beer-Lambert law (mBLL), relative concentration can be calculated as a function of total photon path length. Typically the light emitter and detector are placed ipsilaterally on the subjects skull so recorded measurements are due to back-scattered (reflected) light following elliptical pathways.|$|E

50|$|A {{thin coating}} of nanocrystals {{embedded}} in glass can provide selective control over both visible light and heat-producing near-infrared (<b>NIR)</b> <b>light</b> independently climates. The technology employs a small jolt of electricity to switch the material between NIR-transmitting and NIR-blocking states. Nanocrystals of {{indium tin oxide}} embedded in a glassy matrix of niobium oxide form a composite material. The voltage ranges over 2.5 volts. The same window can also be switched to a dark mode, blocking both light and heat, or to a bright, fully transparent mode. The effect relies on a synergistic interaction in the region where glassy matrix meets nanocrystal that increases the electrochromic effect. The atoms connect across the nanocrystal-glass interface, causing a structural rearrangement in the glass matrix. The interaction creates space inside the glass, allowing charge to move more readily.|$|E
50|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{can be used}} as multifunctional biological transporters and near-infrared {{agents for}} selective cancer cell destruction. Biological systems are known to be highly transparent to 700- to 1,100-nm near-infrared (<b>NIR)</b> <b>light.</b> Researchers showed that the strong optical absorbance of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in this special spectral window, an intrinsic property of SWNTs, can be used for optical stimulation of nanotubes inside living cells to afford multifunctional nanotube biological transporters. They used oligonucleotides transported inside living Hela cells by nanotubes. The oligonucleotides translocated into the cell nucleus upon endosomal rupture triggered by NIR laser pulses. Continuous NIR radiation caused cell death because of excessive local heating of SWNT in vitro. Selective cancer cell destruction was achieved by functionalization of SWNT with a folate moiety, selective internalization of SWNTs inside cells labeled with folate receptor tumor markers, and NIR-triggered cell death, without harming receptor-free normal cells. Thus, the transporting capabilities of carbon nanotubes combined with suitable functionalization chemistry and their intrinsic optical properties can lead to new classes of novel nanomaterials for drug delivery and cancer therapy.|$|E
50|$|Photoswitching is the {{conversion}} from one chemical isomer to another triggered by light. Photoswitching finds use in optical data processing and storage and in photorelease. Photorelease {{is the use}} of light to induce a moiety attached to the nanoparticle surface to detach. UCNPs of lanthanide-doped NaYF4 have been applied as remote control photoswitches. UCNPs are useful photoswitches because they can be irradiated with low-cost NIR radiation and convert it into UV radiation extremely locally. Photocatalytic systems can be enhanced with UCNPs by the same principle as solar cells. In titania coated with YF3:Yb/Tm UCNPs, degradation of pollutants was observed under NIR radiation. Normally low-energy NIR radiation cannot induce photocatalysis in titania, which has a band gap in the UV range. The excitation in titania results in a surface redox reaction which decomposes compounds near the surface. UCNPs enable cheap low-energy NIR photons to replace expensive UV photons. In biological contexts UV light is highly absorbed and causes tissue damage. However NIR is weakly absorbed and induces UCNP behavior in vivo. Recently, core-shell UCNPs were used to initiate the photocleavage of a Ruthenium complex using an intensity of <b>NIR</b> <b>light</b> that is completely safe in biomedical use.|$|E

This project is originally rooted in the rigorous theoretical and experimental solid-state physics of Prof. Friedemann Freund, whose theory is able to explain the whole spectrum of electromagnetic type phenomena that have been reported before large earthquakes for decades, if not centuries: when submitting rocks to significant stresses, electrons and positive holes are activated; the latter flow to less stressed domains of the material thus generating large-scale electric currents. Those in turn induce local geoelectric and geomagnetic anomalies, stimulated infrared emission, air ionization, increase levels of ozone and carbon monoxide. All those fluctuations are currently measured using ground stations or remote sensing technologies. There are innumerable reports of heterogeneous types of precursory phenomena ranging from emission of electromagnetic waves from ultralow frequency (ULF) to visible (VIS) and near-infrared (<b>NIR)</b> <b>light,</b> electric field and magnetic field anomalies of various kinds (see below), all the way to unusual animal behavior, which has been reported again and again.|$|E
50|$|One {{issue with}} {{utilizing}} SWCNTs for the photoactive layer of PV devices is the mixed purity when synthesized (about 1/3 metallic and 2/3 semiconducting). Metallic SWCNTs (m-SWCNTs) can cause exciton recombination between the electron and hole pairs, and the junction between metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs (s-SWCNTs) form Schottky barriers that reduce the hole transmission probability. The discrepancy in electronic structure of synthesized CNTs requires electronic sorting to separate {{and remove the}} m-SWCNTs to optimize the semiconducting performance. This may be accomplished through diameter and electronic sorting of CNTs through a density gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU) process, involving a gradient of surfactants that can separate the CNTs by diameter, chirality, and electronic type. This sorting method enables the separation of m-SWCNTs and the precise collection of multiple chiralities of s-SWCNTs, each chirality able to absorb a unique wavelength of light. The multiple chiralities of s-SWCNTs are used as the hole transport material along with the fullerene component PC71BM to fabricate heterojunctions for the PV active layer. The polychiral s-SWCNTs enable a wide range optical absorption from visible to near-infrared (<b>NIR)</b> <b>light,</b> increasing the photo current relative to using single chirality nanotubes. To maximize light absorption, the inverted device structure was used with a zinc oxide nanowire layer penetrating the active layer to minimize collection length. Molybdenum oxide (MoOx) was utilized as a high work function hole transport layer to maximize voltage.|$|E

This optical stimulation of semiconductors is then coupled with voltage-based stimulation in order to store information. Other advantages of utilizing UCNPs for flash drives include that all materials employed are photo- and thermally stable. Furthermore, imperfections in the UCNP film will not affect data storage. These advantages yielded an impressive achieved storage limit, making UCNP films a promising material in optical storage. UCNPs can be applied in niche applications for displays and printing. Anti-counterfeiting codes or prints can be fabricated using UCNPs in existing colloidal ink preparations. Flexible, transparent displays have also been fabricated using UCNPs.

Also, a cocaine-specific aptamer is developed to identify cocaine-laced fingerprints by the same method.35 Upconverting nanoparticles can also be used for barcoding. These micro-barcodes can be embedded onto various objects. The barcodes are seen under NIR illumination and can be imaged using an iPhone camera and a 20X microscope objective.|$|E

Of paramount importance for thermogenesis is vascular perfusion, which controls the flow of cool blood in, and warmed blood out, of BAT. We have developed an optical method for the quantitative imaging of BAT perfusion in the living, intact animal using the heptamethine indocyanine IR- 786 and near-infrared (<b>NIR)</b> fluorescent <b>light.</b> We present {{a detailed analysis of}} the physical, chemical, and cellular properties of IR- 786, its biodistribution and pharmacokinetics, and its uptake into BAT. Using transgenic animals with homozygous deletion of Type II iodothyronine deiodinase, or homozygous deletion of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) 1 and 2, we demonstrate that BAT perfusion can be measured noninvasively, accurately, and reproducibly. Using these techniques, we show that UCP 1 / 2 knockout animals, when compared to wild-type animals, have a higher baseline perfusion of BAT but a similar maximal response to β 3 -receptor agonist. These results suggest that compensation for UCP deletion is mediated, in part, by the control of BAT perfusion.

5000|$|When AuNP {{are exposed}} to <b>NIR</b> <b>light,</b> the {{oscillating}} electromagnetic field of the light causes the free electrons of the AuNP to collectively coherently oscillate. Changing {{the size and shape}} of AuNP, changes the wavelength that gets absorbed. A desired wavelength would be between 700-1000 nm because biological tissue is optically transparent at these wavelengths. While all AuNP properties are sensitive to change in their shape and size, Au nanorods properties are extremely sensitive to any change in any of their dimensions regarding their length and wide or their aspect ratio. When light is shown on a metal NP, the NP forms a dipole oscillation along the direction of the electric field. When the oscillation reaches its maximum, this frequency is called the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). AuNR have two SPR spectrum bands: one in the NIR region caused by its longitudinal oscillation which tends to be stronger with a longer wavelength and one in the visible region caused by the transverse electronic oscillation which tends to be weaker with a shorter wavelength. The SPR characteristics account for the increase in light absorption for the particle. As the AuNR aspect ratio increases, the absorption wavelength is redshifted and light scattering efficiency is increased. [...] The electrons excited by the NIR lose energy quickly after absorption via electron-electron collisions, and as these electrons relax back down, the energy is released as a phonon that then heats the environment of the AuNP which in cancer treatments would be the cancerous cells. This process is observed when a laser has a continuous wave onto the AuNP. Pulsed laser light beams generally results in the AuNP melting or ablation of the particle. Continues wave lasers take minutes rather than a single pulse time for a pulsed laser, continues wave lasers are able to heat larger areas at once.|$|E
