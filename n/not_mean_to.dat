5|$|In 2007, U.S. {{federal judge}} Tena Campbell {{rejected}} Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate {{because they were}} unable to prove that he did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> kill his victim. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected motions for appeal by his defense on March 8, 2010. Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time. State court Judge Robin Reese signed an execution warrant on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the death sentence.|$|E
5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E
5|$|Truce {{terms are}} {{recorded}} {{as having been}} used in the following circumstances; being out of breath, having a stitch, a shoelace being undone, fear of clothes being damaged, needing to go to the lavatory, checking the time, wanting to discuss or clarify rules during a fight or game, or one combatant wanting to remove their spectacles or jacket before continuing. It does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> surrender, although it may sometimes be used in preparation to surrendering. Truce terms are only used within a specific age group, have little currency outside that group and are by and large abandoned by the age of 10 or 11 years. However, research into early recorded use of these terms found examples of some of these terms being used as a sign of surrender in battle or adult fights or quarrels as late as the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Lewis {{enters a}} country pub and {{unexpectedly}} meets Audrey {{and her daughter}} Gail. Upon seeing them, he pretends he is his own identical twin brother. Neither Audrey or Gail are fooled and Lewis offers {{to pay for their}} drinks. He then leaves the pub and heads to Coronation Street. Lewis visits Peter Barlow, apologises for stealing from him and returns the money he took with an extra £1000 as compensation. Lewis then goes to Audrey's salon and he tells her he did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> hurt her. He asks Audrey to drive him to the police station to prove how sorry he is. After he is given bail, Lewis enters the Rovers Return and is punched by Deirdre. Lewis faces hostility from Audrey's grandson, David (Jack P. Shepherd) upon his return to the salon. He begs Audrey for forgiveness but she throws him out. Lewis sends her flowers and Audrey visits his address and finds he is living in a bedsit. David's wife, Kylie (Paula Lane), introduces herself to Lewis and he defends her against Brian Packham's (Peter Gunn) accusations that she is giving her son the wrong food.|$|E

25|$|At Rabaul, General Imamura {{was still}} {{convinced}} that the Allies did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> stay long at Torokina—he {{was sure it was}} just a stepping stone. He thus had no interest in mounting a decisive counterattack on the Allied beachhead using the substantial number of troops he already had {{in the southern part of}} Bougainville. Instead, he reinforced the Buka Island area, just off the north coast of the larger island, believing it to be the Allies' real target. Thus, the Army repeated the error of Guadalcanal, while the Navy could not convince Imamura of the Americans' real intentions.|$|E
25|$|Robertson told ministers (30 May) that “Haig {{had no idea}} of {{any attempt}} to break through the German lines. It would only be a move to (rescue) the French”, {{although}} he was probably not aware of Haig’s insistence, overruling Rawlinson’s earlier plan, on bombarding deeper into the German defences in the hope of breaking through and “fighting the enemy in the open”. Maurice later wrote (29 June) Haig “does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> knock his head against a brick wall, and if he finds he is only making a bulge and meeting with heavy opposition he means to stop and consolidate and try somewhere else”.|$|E
500|$|Crawford {{sees the}} {{events at the}} 1913 Derby as a lens [...] "through which... whole life has been interpreted", and the {{uncertainty}} of her motives and intentions that day has affected how she has been judged by history. Carolyn Collette, a literary critic who has studied Davison's writing, identifies the different motives ascribed to Davison, including [...] "uncontrolled impulses" [...] or a search for martyrdom for women's suffrage. Collette also sees a more current trend among historians [...] "to accept what some of her close contemporaries believed: that Davison's actions that day were deliberate" [...] and that she attempted to attach the suffragette colours to the King's horse. Cicely Hale, a suffragette {{who worked at the}} WSPU and who knew Davison, described her as [...] "a fanatic" [...] who was prepared to die but did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to.</b> Other observers, such as Purvis, and Ann Morley and Liz Stanley—Davison's biographers—agree that Davison did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> die.|$|E

500|$|Ferrari {{president}} Luca di Montezemolo described Michael Schumacher's title victory as the [...] "most {{beautiful day}} of my life". He further dedicated the championship to the Ferrari team, their worldwide fan base, Ferrari's majority owner FIAT, and the team's sponsors and suppliers for their continued support. Former World Champion Scheckter praised both Ferrari and Michael Schumacher, though he expressed disappointment at losing his status as the final World Champion for Ferrari. However, the former President of Italy Francesco Cossiga criticised Michael Schumacher's conduct during the Italian National Anthem where the German traditionally imitated a conductor when it was heard. Michael Schumacher responded by saying that he did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> cause offence and insisted that he was respectful to the national anthem.|$|E
500|$|At the Netroots Nation Conference in July 2015, {{dozens of}} Black Lives Matter activists {{took over the}} stage at an event {{featuring}} Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders. Activists, including Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors, asked both candidates for specific policy proposals to address deaths in police custody. The protesters chanted several slogans, including [...] "if I die in police custody, burn everything down". After conference organizers pleaded with the protesters for several minutes, O'Malley responded by pledging to release a wide-ranging plan for criminal justice reform. Protesters later booed O'Malley when he stated [...] "Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter." [...] O'Malley later apologized for his remarks, saying that he did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> disrespect the black community.|$|E

In a story about the Maharishi, Allan Kozinn had written: [...] "Alexis Mardas, a supposed inventor and charlatan who had become a Beatles’ insider". After an appeal, Mardas {{won the right}} to continue his case of defamation against The New York Times in 2009. After The New York Times produced a witness, Sir Harold Evans, who gave evidence supporting the journalistic responsibility of the paper, Mardas said he would not pursue the case further, on condition that the paper would publicly explain that by labelling him as a charlatan, it did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> imply that he was a con man.|$|E

He would go further, and say that the legislature and system of representation possessed the full and entire confidence of the country. [...] He would go still further, and say, that if at the present moment he had imposed upon him the duty of forming a legislature for any country [...] he did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> assert that he could form such a legislature as they possessed now, for the nature of man was incapable of reaching such excellence at once.

500|$|In 2006, Akhtar directed, {{produced}} {{and wrote the}} screenplay of Don starring Shah Rukh Khan in the title role, a remake of 1978 film Don, starring Amitabh Bachchan. It marked his first project holding {{the status of a}} remake. The character of Don became iconic and popular. Despite this, he noted that he did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> be a [...] "torchbearer of the remake brigade" [...] and did not feel comfortable with being credited for the trend of remakes in the film industry. The film released on 20 October 2006 and was declared a [...] "hit" [...] at the box office, grossing around 105 crore worldwide. It became widely known for its dialogues. However, critics predominantly condemned Akhtar's direction and screenplay. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama said Akhtar had [...] "climbed the ladder as far as craftsmanship is concerned [...] but despite a readymade classic at his disposal, the storyteller just doesn't get it right this time." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{its release}} in North America, 1UP blogger Alejandro Quan-Madrid equated the Moja {{characters}} in LocoRoco to blackface, and citing {{the game as}} an example of [...] "institutionalized racism that needs calling out". Quan-Madrid and 1UP reporter Jemery Parish noted that the Japanese culture does not have the same racial population as western countries like the United States, and as such, blackface or other similar representations of black persons are taken for granted in that country, and localization usually handles such issues. Quan-Madrid called on Sony to make a simple color change to the Moja, similar to what Capcom had done for the character of Oilman in Mega Man Powered Up. Developers for the game, including Kouno, noted that the Moja character design was based on the hairstyle of Keigo Tsuchiya, the game's artist, at the time of development, and did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> imply any racist tones. The accusation of racism came days before a similar charge against Sony for an advertisement for the white-colored PSP, portraying a white woman subjugating a black woman.|$|E

[...] The resulting row sees Joe insult Pauline's family—suggesting that her [...] "perfect marriage" [...] with Arthur was [...] "nothing but a fantasy" [...] and branding Mark [...] "diseased", Michelle a [...] "scrubber" [...] and Arthur a [...] "con"—to which Pauline responds by smashing a plate over his head. Wendy Richard commented, [...] "It was not just the memory of Arthur that stopped the marriage to Joe being a success. He was proven to be a weak and untruthful man.

According to future IOC vice president Dick Pound, the insertion of the Rhodesian issue into the speech [...] "was universally condemned, and Brundage left office under a cloud of criticism that effectively undermined a lifetime of well-intentioned work in the Olympic movement".
