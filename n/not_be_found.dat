5|$|The Annamalaiyar temple {{is one of}} the Pancha Bhoota Stalams, or five Shiva temples, {{with each}} a manifestation of a natural element: land, water, air, sky and fire. In Annamalaiyar temple, Shiva is said to have {{manifested}} himself as a massive column of fire, whose crown and feet could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> by the Hindu gods, Brahma and Vishnu. The main lingam in the shrine is referred as Agni Lingam, and represents duty, virtue, self-sacrifice and liberation through ascetic life {{at the end of the}} Agni kalpa.|$|E
5|$|The case {{came before}} Mr. Justice Owen and a jury at Leicester Crown Court in July 1990. The judge {{rejected}} a submission {{on behalf of}} the defendant that he could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> guilty of rape due to the marital rape exemption. He then pleaded not guilty to rape, but guilty to attempted rape and to the assault charge. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for attempted rape and 18 months' imprisonment for assault, with the sentences to run concurrently.|$|E

5|$|These factors {{combined}} with what RF politicians and supporters saw as British decadence, chicanery and betrayal {{to create the}} case they put forward that UDI, while dubious legally and likely to provoke international uproar, might nevertheless be in their eyes justifiable and necessary {{for the good of}} the country and region if an accommodation could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> with Whitehall.|$|E

5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. In fact, it was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found.</b> The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought {{it had something to}} do with naval guns.|$|E
5|$|From March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took {{advantage}} of the computing power of PlayStation 3s. At the time of its inception, its main streaming Cell processor delivered a 20x speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> on other systems such as the Xbox 360. The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to Amdahl's law, and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost. This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.|$|E
5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found.</b> In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E

5|$|In June 2007, Blair {{resigned}} {{as the leader}} of the Labour Party and Gordon Brown, previously the Chancellor of the Exchequer, succeeded him following the 2007 Labour Party conference. Three years earlier, Blair had announced that he would not be contesting a fourth successive general election as Labour Party leader if he won the 2005 general election. Brown initially had strong public support and plans for a quick general election were widely publicised, though never officially announced. On 18th February 2008, Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that the failing bank, Northern Rock, would be nationalised, supporting it with loans and guarantees of £50,000,000,000. The bank had been destabilised by the US subprime mortgage crisis the previous year, and a private buyer of the bank could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Huntington Development Corporation {{suggested}} that an off-track betting facility be constructed, however, the idea died after Governor Arch Moore vetoed an off-track betting bill that was critical to the project's success. In 1987, the Webb Companies presented {{a plan for a}} $110 million mixed-use complex called RiverCenter that would feature a 20-story office tower, an underground parking garage and a skyway to the Harris Riverfront Park. The project failed when two large tenants could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> to anchor the project. In 1988, the city's grant to help develop the project was revoked.|$|E
5|$|Of the fatalities, 26 of the German sailors {{were buried}} the same evening {{the battle was}} fought in a mass grave just east of Östergarn Church. One crew had fallen {{overboard}} and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found.</b> Two of the crew members who died during transportation to Roma were buried at Björke cemetery. The surviving German crew were interned, first in Roma, then at Blåhäll in Tofta. The Swedish salvage company Neptun refloated Albatross on 23 July and towed her to Fårösund before proceeding to Oskarshamn, where she was interned {{for the duration of}} the war. Sweden returned Albatross and her crew to Kiel in January 1919; there, she was formally decommissioned on 23 January. On 21 March, she was stricken from the naval register and thereafter sold for 900,000marks and broken up for scrap in Hamburg.|$|E

5|$|On 12 July 1936, in Madrid, {{a member}} of the Falange named Jorge Bardina murdered Lieutenant José Castillo of the Assault Guards police force. Castillo was {{a member of}} the Socialist party. The next day, members of the Assault Guards arrested José Calvo Sotelo, a leading Spanish monarchist and a {{prominent}} parliamentary conservative; the original target was Gil Robles but he could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found.</b> Calvo Sotelo had protested against agricultural reforms, expropriations, and restrictions on the authority of the Catholic Church, which he considered Bolshevist and anarchist. He instead advocated the creation of a corporative state. Calvo Sotelo was shot by the Guards without trial.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 20 June, two armed Protestant corps coming from Montbéliard and Neuchâtel were {{travelling}} to Besançon. However, some of the troops from the Neuchâtel group decided to abandon the battle, as their request for extra pay had been denied. The other soldiers continued upstream. The remaining soldiers from Neuchâtel {{got into a fight}} with the inhabitants of Morteau; after a fierce battle, they were forced to retreat. After waiting for the group from Neuchâtel, which could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found,</b> Capitaine Paul de Beaujeu decided to continue with the plan. By midnight, the soldiers had reached Palente, and they hid in the forests of Chalezeule while establishing a plan of attack. With the help of a dozen small boats laid end-to-end, the soldiers crossed the Doubs. To continue the attack, the soldiers would need the help of the townspeople.|$|E
5|$|Santa Santita, or Magdalena, The Unholy Saint, is a 2004 Filipino film {{starring}} Angelica Panganiban and Jericho Rosales, {{directed by}} Laurice Guillen. The film follows Malen, {{the daughter of}} an intercessor, her love affair with a hustler and gigolo, and her confrontation of the evil within her life. Based on a script by Jerry Gracio, the film was picked up by Guillen in 2000 but did not start production because an appropriate actress for Malen could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found.</b> After picking Panganiban, Guillen began work, and the eventual film was released on November 17, 2004, in the Philippines and March 11, 2005, internationally. Receiving good reviews from Variety and the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Santa Santita was one of only two films to be rated as Grade A by the Cinema Evaluation Board of the Philippines, and represented the Philippines at the Asiaticafilmediale festival in Italy and the Bangkok International Film Festival.|$|E

Aathara Stala are Shiva temples which are considered to be personifications of the Tantric chakras of human anatomy. The Annamalaiyar temple is called the Manipooraga stalam, and is associated with the Manipooraga chakra. The temple is revered in Tevaram, the Tamil Saiva canon and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 276 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon.|$|E
5|$|The {{carousel}} {{is one of}} {{the three}} oldest surviving Dentzel menagerie carousels. Thirty-one of its 42wood-carved animals are horses, 17 standing and 14 jumping. There are also three goats, three giraffes, three deer, one lion, and one tiger. The single lion and tiger are typical of Dentzel-created carousels, as are the three giraffes; Gustav Dentzel's love of that animal resulted in all of his carousels including at least one row of giraffes. The animals are arranged in three circles around the central mechanism, alternating leaping or jumping horses with stationary animals. Typical for a Mangels-Illions manufactured carousel, there are 18jumping animals, all but one of which is original; the horse that could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in 1975 was replaced with another Dentzel horse. Although the animals were not originally carved to display jewels, at some point they were so displayed at the amusement park, and thus the museum restored the animals on the outside circle with jewels.|$|E
5|$|There is no need, under Churchill v Walton, to {{show that}} the conspirators knew that their {{proposed}} course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; if two people conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not a conspiracy to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim. The defendants will similarly <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> guilty if they are unaware that a crime will result; if two people agree to grow plants, unaware that the plants are illegal, they have not engaged in a conspiracy. On the other hand, if the two people believe the plants to be illegal even though they are not, they could be found guilty.|$|E
