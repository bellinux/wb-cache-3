40|$|A {{conventional}} bond is a {{debt instrument}} {{consisting of a}} series of periodic coupon payments plus the repayment of the principal at maturity. As the name suggests, a zero-coupon bond has <b>no</b> <b>coupon</b> payments. It has only a single payment consisting of the repayment of the principal at maturity. The zero-coupon bond is sold at a discount and then redeemed for its face value at maturity. The return to the investor is the difference between the face value of the bond and its discounted purchase price. In this article, the author examines the investment characteristics of zero-coupon bonds. In particular, a type of zero-coupon bond known as a strip bond is discussed. A strip bond is created by stripping coupon payments from conventional bonds. The strip bond market in Canada has grown substantially since the late 1980 s and is now an integral part of Canadian fixed-income markets. As well, the opportunity to trade in the strip bond market improves the liquidity and efficiency of Canadian fixed-income markets, thus helping to reduce the overall cost of borrowing to the government. ...|$|R

Results from the model offer predictions on the relationships among coupon redemptions, shelf price, and coupon face value. The authors test these predictions on a large data set of hundreds of coupon events across six packaged goods categories. The data show that when a small coupon face value is offered, the shelf price is likely to be reduced. They also find that coupon efficiency increases when there is a lower retail price. The results are of interest to managers planning a promotion calendar and deciding whether to coordinate price promotions with coupon events, and they contribute to economic theory.

Furthermore, the thesis will analyze if the Fondskatteutredningens suggestions {{to changes in the}} current legislation is appropriate to the purpose it tries to obtain. Today there is a difference in the taxation of dividends paid to Swedish investment funds and foreign investment funds. Dividends paid to foreign investment funds is being taxed in accordance with the <b>Coupon</b> <b>Tax</b> Act (1970 : 624), in which no deduction of the tax is possible. Swedish investment funds on the other hand have the possibility to deduct as much of the received dividends that they have given in dividends to its shareholders. The difference in the taxation between investment funds because of origin has been reviewed by both Swedish court and by the European Court of Justice. It has in these cases been up to the courts to review if a difference in taxation of dividends could constitute a violation of the free movement. Even if a national legislation would be considered to be in violation of the free movement there are however developed justifying obstacles to the free movement. These obstacles are being analyzed in the thesis to see if the difference in the Swedish taxation can be justified. Within the EU the UCITS-directive regulates investment funds. Since the directive is being changed and will come in to force during 2011 the Fondskatteutredningen was presented in 2009 which presents suggestions to changes in the Swedish legislation concerning taxation of dividends to investment funds.

40|$|IntroductionFood pricing {{policies}} to promote healthy diets, such as taxes, price manipulations, and food subsidies, {{have been tested}} in different settings. However, little consensus exists {{about the effect of}} these policies on the availability of healthy and unhealthy foods, on what foods consumers buy, or on the impact of food purchases on consumer health outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of studies of the effect of food-pricing interventions on retail sales and on consumer purchasing and consumption of healthy foods and beverages. MethodsWe used MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials. gov, and the Cochrane Library to conduct a systematic search for peer-reviewed articles related to studies of food {{pricing policies}}. We selected articles that were published in English from January 2000 through December 2016 on the following types of studies: 1) real-world experimental studies (randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and natural experiments); 2) population studies of people or retail stores in middle-income and high-income countries; 3) pricing interventions alone or in combination with other strategies (price promotions, <b>coupons,</b> <b>taxes,</b> or cash-back rebates), excluding studies of vending-machine or online sales; and 4) outcomes studies at the retail (stocking, sales) and consumer (purchasing, consumption) levels. We selected 65 articles representing 30 studies for review. ResultsSixteen pricing intervention studies that sought to improve access to healthy food and beverage options reported increased stocking and sales of promoted food items. Most studies (n = 23) reported improvement in the purchasing and consumption of healthy foods or beverages or decreased purchasing and consumption of unhealthy foods or beverages. Most studies assessed promotions of fresh fruits and vegetables (n = 20); however, these foods may be hard to source, have high perishability, and raise concerns about safety and handling. Few of the pricing studies we reviewed discouraged purchasing and consumption of unhealthy foods (n = 6). Many studies we reviewed had limitations, including lack of formative research, process evaluation, or psychosocial and health assessments of the intervention 2 ̆ 019 s impact; short intervention duration; or no assessment of food substitutions or the effects of pricing interventions on food purchasing and diets. ConclusionPricing interventions generally increased stocking, sales, purchasing, and consumption of promoted foods and beverages.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays that employ predictive analytics, structural modeling techniques and field experiments to understand and nudge customers’ behaviors in two types of online engagement platforms. The first one is customers’ purchase behaviors in an online grocery store {{and the other is}} customer’ contribution behaviors in a reward-based crowdfunding platform. In both contexts, we study how to actively nudge their behaviors. In Chapter 2, we investigates how, when dealing with products that are available in limited quantities, customers may be nudged to purchase them. Specifically, our main problem is to identify targeted customers to receive the limited number of coupons. We develop a Support Vector Machines (SVM) based approach to rank order customers. We conduct a field experiment in an online grocery store to evaluate how well the identified customers are nudged through information and/or couponing. We find that, in terms of the successful nudges, our SVM-based approach performed better than other approaches. ^ We are not just focusing on nudging customers to purchase but also on nudging them to contribute. In Chapter 3, we examine how to leverage the project reward structure (PRS) to nudge backers to contribute on reward-based crowdfunding platforms. We develop a structural model of the backer’s dynamic pledging and learning behaviors. We use it to test a variety of behavioral theories of how PRS and intertemporal changes in the PRS influence backers’ pledging decisions {{over the course of a}} project’s funding period. We also use the model to run market simulations and shed lights on how to offer the PRS changes and what is the optimal timing to make such changes. ^ Coupons often act as price discrimination tools to nudge low willingness-to-pay customers to purchase. However, in our context where there is limited product availability, strategies other than just sending coupons may be desirable. For some customers, it is sufficient that we provide information alone but <b>no</b> <b>coupons.</b> Also coupons of different discount depths might play a different role as customers might update their expectations. Particularly, in Chapter 4, we investigate the impact of different nudging strategies on customers’ purchase behaviors. We evaluate the effectiveness of those different nudging strategies via a randomized field experiment. Consistent with the prior literature, we found coupons could serve as a form of “advertisement”. Furthermore, our findings show that coupons with a low discount rate could have a longer information carryover effect than those with a higher discount one. The experiment also generated insights about when couponing as opposed to information is more effective when nudging. ...|$|R

By using the fluctuation identities for the spectrally negative Lévy process, we obtain a candidate bankruptcy level {{as well as a}} sufficient condition for optimality. The optimality holds in particular when, monotonically in the asset value, the coupon rate is decreasing, the value of tax benefits is increasing, the loss amount at bankruptcy is increasing, and its proportion relative to the asset value is decreasing.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the impact of {{malnutrition}} {{on the distribution of}} abilities and income in a simple overlapping generations framework. Workers are distributed uniformly over a low-ability and a high-ability range. If workers earn below subsistence wages, the probability that their children will have low abilities is higher than with above subsistence wages due to the malnutrition resulting from low incomes. Using a nested Ethier production function we find that there is an optimal share of low-ability workers in the economy which maximizes output. Due to the intergenerational propagation of low abilities resulting from malnutrition, economies may however get trapped in sub-optimal equilibria with too large shares of low-ability workers. Distributing food <b>coupons</b> financed by <b>taxes</b> of the parent generation to the offspring of these low-ability workers will increase the likelihood that they will be in the high-ability range, permanently increasing output for future generations. Using a numerical example, we show that this type of redistributive policy is welfare improving if the parent generation alive during the initiation of the policy is reimbursed for their loss in utility due to taxes. ...|$|R

[...] He used the press to create himself a fictitious identity as [...] "Oskar Haupt", creating both an official (seeming) identity document and a certificate of military unfitness. The quality was excellent: even the usual watermarks were correctly incorporated. [...] According to the documents Oskar Haupt was employed as a scientific draftsman at the Botanical Institute in Königin-Luise-Straße ("Queen Luise Street"). Having perfected his technique he quickly branched out, specialising in official documents, notably military identity cards and food coupons for butter ("Reisebuttermarken [...] "). Most food ration coupons were marked with the identity of the retailer who would exchange them, but the butter coupons were not assigned to any particular retailer, which may have reflected the relative volatility of butter supplies.

40|$|We {{examine the}} basic premise that {{consumers}} may anticipate future promotions and adjust their purchase behavior accordingly. We develop a structural model of households who make purchase decisions to minimize their expenditure over a finite period. The model allows for future expectations of promotions {{to enter the}} purchase decision. Households with adequate inventory of the product may face a trade-off of buying {{in the current period}} with a coupon or defer the purchase until next period, given their expectations of future promotions. Thus, we provide a framework for examining the impact of consumer expectations on choice behavior. The target audiences for our paper are (a) empirical researchers who intend to make structural models part of their applied research agenda; and (b) managers who value and seek to understand the impact of consumers' coupon expectations on current purchase behavior. Our research objective is to provide an empirical framework to examine whether and to what extent consumers anticipate future coupon promotions and adjust purchase behavior. The central premise of our approach is that a rational consumer minimizes the present discounted value of the cost of a purchase where cost in a single period consists of purchase price, inventory holding cost, gains from coupons, and potential stockout cost. We aim to test whether our hypotheses regarding the various elements of the cost structure are supported and that whether consumers take into account future discounted cost when making current purchase decisions. The research methodology we adopt is relatively new in econometrics and known as the estimable stochastic structural dynamic programming method. The methodology amounts to incorporating a maximum likelihood routine embedded in a dynamic programming problem. The dynamic programming problem is solved several times within a maximum likelihood iteration for each value of the state space elements and for each value of the parameters in the parameter set. The state space in our model consists of purchase and nonpurchase alternatives in each time period, <b>coupon</b> availability and <b>no</b> <b>coupon</b> availability in each time period, level of inventory in each time period for each household, and consumption rate of each household. We use scanner panel data on purchases in the disposable diaper product category and promotions. We estimate the inventory holding and stockout costs, brand-specific value of coupons, and consumers' expectations of future coupons. The key insights and lessons learned can be summarized as follows: (1) Our results are consistent with the notion that consumers hold beliefs about future coupons, and that such beliefs affect the purchase decision. We find that the dynamic optimization model performs significantly better than a single-period optimization model and a naive benchmark model. (2) We find a high and significant stockout cost, consistent with the essential nature of the product category. Our estimate of the holding cost yields a reasonable annualized percentage value when converted to the cost of capital. We find that consumer valuation of coupons differ markedly across brands. (3) Our empirical evidence supports the notion that consumers hold beliefs about future coupon availability. We also find that the expectations about future coupons, estimated endogenously, differ depending upon whether or not a coupon was available in the current period. Thus, the proposed model structure yields rich managerial insights and facilitates several “what if” scenarios. A possible limitation of our model, and estimable structural models in general, is the computational cost. While it is possible to conceptually extend the state space to accommodate variations across households and add a richer parameter structure, each addition multiplies the size of the state space and the computation time. For this reason, we have kept the state space as tight as possible and refrained from additions that would otherwise enable us to incorporate heterogeneity in consumer decisions. For example, we assumed that consumers are similar other than reflected by their purchase behavior. We built a category purchase incidence model rather than a brand choice model. We refrained from including unobserved heterogeneity in the parameters. We chose to opt out of modeling autocorrelation and other time-dependent error term patterns in the likelihood function. Thus, we have made an effort to build a structural model that reasonably reflects consumer purchase behavior without requiring expensive computation. Currently, there are developments in econometrics to approximate the computation of the valuation functions without sacrificing much accuracy. When these methods are well developed we expect that structural models will become more commonplace in marketing. consumer expectations, econometrics, estimable stochastic dynamic programming models, promotions, structural models...|$|R

Equations to correct for apparent strain in a real-time fashion and data from apparent-strain tests for composite and metallic specimens over a temperature range from - 450 F to + 250 F are presented in this paper. Three approaches to extrapolate apparent-strain data from - 320 F to - 430 F are presented and compared to the measured apparent-strain data. The first two approaches use a subset of the apparent-strain curves between - 320 F and 100 F to extrapolate to - 430 F, while the third approach extrapolates the apparent-strain curve over the temperature range of - 320 F to + 250 F to - 430 F.

40|$|AbstractPrototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) {{is first}} of its kind 500 MWe pool type, sodium cooled nuclear reactor which is {{presently}} in advanced stage of construction at Kalpakkam, India. Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) is a shell and tube type, counter current, sodium to sodium heat exchanger. IHX is a very important, massive, over dimensional (∼ 42 tones in weight, ∼ 2 meters in diameter and ∼ 18 meters in length) and critical component of reactor, as it transfers heat from the radioactive primary circuit sodium to non-radioactive secondary circuit sodium forming the boundary between these two circuits. The principal material of construction of IHX is austenitic stainless steel grade 316 LN. Each IHX has 3600 nos. of straight seamless tubes which are rolled and then welded to the either ends of top and bottom tubesheets by autogenous pulsed Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) process. The shell welding around the tube bundle is extremely difficult and challenging task due to small gap between the tube bundle and shell inside diameter. Special arrangements were made to avoid arc strike or fusion on the tube during shell welding around the tube bundle. A mechanical hardfaced seal arrangement at the interface of the IHX outer shell and the inner vessel stand pipe is the chosen design concept to ensure leak tightness in the IHX penetrations. Based on radiation dose rate & shielding considerations during maintenance, handling and decommissioning, nickel based ENiCr-B hard facing alloy (Colmonoy- 5) was chosen to replace the traditionally used cobalt based stellite alloys to improve the resistance to high temperature wear, especially galling of mating surfaces in sodium environment. The more versatile Plasma Transferred Arc Welding (PTAW) and Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) were used for deposition of Colmonoy- 5. The hardfacing on the seal ring is really challenging task, as the diameter is too large and thickness & width is too small and which has hardfacing on all mating surfaces. Extensive varieties of trials were conducted on the mockup to optimize the hardfacing process along with heat treatment cycle to obtain minimum distortion deploying special tools and fixtures. Intermediate Heat Exchanger involves 10 mm and 28 mm thick borated stainless steel components around the tube bundle and bottom portion confirming to ASTM 887, Type 304 B 4, Grade B classification to reduce the radiation level in secondary sodium system while flowing through the IHX. Various types of welding trials were conducted on the test coupons for welding procedure qualification of borated stainless steel components using versatile grades of welding consumables. More than hundred <b>nos.</b> of trial <b>coupons</b> welded using 10 varieties of welding consumables have shown fissures and cracks in weld, as these welding consumables found not having good compatibility with SS 304 B 4, Grade B borated steel. Special development work was taken-up {{for the first time in}} the country by developing a special grade ∼ 1 % borated welding consumable (GRINOX- 308 BRN electrode) specifically for welding of borated steel components of IHX. This paper highlights on welding aspects and challenges during fabrication of Intermediate Heat Exchangers for 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor...|$|R
