500|$|In autumn 1953, McCarthy's {{committee}} {{began its}} ill-fated {{inquiry into the}} United States Army. This began with McCarthy opening {{an investigation into the}} Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy, newly married to Jean Kerr, cut short his honeymoon to open the investigation. He garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the Army researchers, but after weeks of hearings, nothing came of his investigations. Unable to expose any signs of subversion, McCarthy focused instead on the case of Irving Peress, a <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>dentist</b> who had been drafted into the Army in 1952 and promoted to major in November 1953. Shortly thereafter it {{came to the attention of}} the military bureaucracy that Peress, who was a member of the left-wing American Labor Party, had declined to answer questions about his political affiliations on a loyalty-review form. Peress' superiors were therefore ordered to discharge him from the Army within 90 days. McCarthy subpoenaed Peress to appear before his subcommittee on January 30, 1954. Peress refused to answer McCarthy's questions, citing his rights under the Fifth Amendment. McCarthy responded by sending a message to Secretary of the Army, Robert T. Stevens, demanding that Peress be court-martialed. On that same day, Peress asked for his pending discharge from the Army to be effected immediately, and the next day Brigadier General Ralph W. Zwicker, his commanding officer at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey, gave him an honorable separation from the Army. At McCarthy's encouragement, [...] "Who promoted Peress?" [...] became a rallying cry among many anti-communists and McCarthy supporters. In fact, and as McCarthy knew, Peress had been promoted automatically through the provisions of the Doctor Draft Law, for which McCarthy had voted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Preparing for catastrophic events, both human-made and natural, {{is in the}} {{national}} interest and has become a priority since catastrophic events in Oklahoma City, Washington, DC, and <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City. <b>Dentists</b> are a large source of non-physician health manpower that could contribute to the public welfare during catastrophic events that require additional public health human resources. Dentists, by virtue of their education, understand biomedical concepts and have patient care skills that can be directly applied during a catastrophic event. Dentists also can provide training for other types of health care workers and can supervise these individuals. In this article, we propose that dentistry can make a significant contribution as part of a national response before, during, and after a catastrophic event or at the time of a public health emergency. We describe the potential collaboration among a dental school, city and state health departments, law enforcement, the military, and others to develop a curriculum in catastrophe preparedness. Then we describe one dental school’s effort to build a catastrophe preparedness curricu-lum for our students.

Findings are based on replies from 376 of the 466 <b>dentists</b> in western <b>New</b> <b>York</b> State to whom the questionnaire was sent in 1981. The responses indicate that less than 18 percent of western <b>New</b> <b>York</b> State <b>dentists</b> smoke. The proportion is continuing its gradual decline, and dentists lead the general population in smoking abstention. Sixty-two percent of the dentists in the survey do not permit smoking in their waiting rooms, and 84 percent advise patients not to smoke. There is clear evidence of {{a relationship between the}} dentists' own smoking habits and their inclination to promote smoking cessation among patients. As fewer dentists smoke, more will be inclined to foster nonsmoking. Dentists can use a variety of smoking cessation techniques. To carry out a minimal program of antismoking measures, dentists in general practice can serve as nonsmoking role models for their patients, provide information about the health hazards of smoking, give advice, refer patients to cessation programs, recommend cessation measures, and monitor patients' efforts to quit smoking. While smoking cessation measures taken by dentists are not likely to convert more than 1 or 2 percent of patients who smoke per year, in time the dentists' efforts to promote smoking cessation can have an appreciable impact...|$|R

40|$|Maintaining {{knowledge}} of clinical practices, confirming {{to the latest}} scientific information, is a major challenge for health professionals. The study aims were (1) to measure clinicians' knowledge and (2) to determine what social factors could best explain and predict those dental clinicians who are most knowledgeable about current expert recommendations {{for the use of}} appropriate antibiotic regimens for patients at risk for bacterial endocarditis. Telephone interviews were conducted with 322 <b>New</b> <b>York</b> State <b>dentists,</b> assigned to the study by a computer-generated randomization procedure from lists of oral surgeons, urban general practitioners and rural general practitioners. Data demonstrated extraordinary differences in level of knowledge between oral surgeons and general practitioners, while the level of knowledge between urban and rural general practice groups was quite similar. General Linear Model (GLM) -based analyses indicated that practice size, rationalization of practice, and practice setting and affiliations contributed to the explanation of knowledge level among general practitioners, when adjusted for age. R 2 s for each of those variables and age, ranged from a low of 0. 132 to a high of 0. 334. Age made a significant contribution to the explanation of knowledge level in all of the models presented, while the explanatory power of the practice structure variables varied according to respondent's locale (urban vs rural) and age (younger vs older). In order {{to assess the impact of}} these structural variables, they were dichotomized (high-low) and entered into a GLM program which accounted for age and locale. Differences in excess of 20 points (on a 0 - 100 knowledge scale) were sometimes noted. The findings demonstrate the importance of specifying variable relationships in explaining level of knowledge and also suggest, albeit indirectly, differences in the processes by which urban and rural and young and old general practitioners come to know. ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "Amalgam War" [...] raged from 1840 to 1855, [...] "broke up friendships and, even {{threatened to}} disrupt the profession." [...] In 1841, the American Society of Dental Surgeons, which had been founded the year before as the first national dental society in the United States, appointed a committee to study the amalgam problem. The committee reported that all filling materials in which mercury was an ingredient were, [...] "hurtful both to the teeth and {{every part of the}} mouth, {{and that there was no}} tooth in which caries in it could be arrested, and the organ rendered serviceable by being filled, in which gold could not be employed." [...] Two years later, without any scientific testing of silver amalgam, their derogatory report resulted in the society's blanket statement that, [...] "the use of amalgam constitutes malpractice." [...] On the other hand, Dr. Christopher S. Brewster of Paris thought that to condemn the use of amalgam in all cases merely because its use was abused by some [...] "unprincipled quacks" [...] was unwise. He felt that, [...] "much good has been and may be done by a judicious use of this composition." [...] In 1844, Dr. Parmly, one of the founding members of the American Society of Dental Surgeons, stated that, [...] "gold is the only substance known that can be permanently relied upon," [...] and Dr. Townsend recommended, [...] "removal of teeth that could not be saved by gold." [...] In 1844, the society's members were warned that they were to sign a pledge never to use amalgam or they would risk being expelled from the membership. Many members resigned, and by 1847 only five of <b>New</b> <b>York's</b> 200 <b>dentists</b> remained in the society, which Dr. Charles C. Allen said had [...] "gold" [...] for its motto.

50|$|As arc {{lighting}} systems spread so did stories {{of how the}} high voltages involved were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead. One such story in 1881 of drunken dock worker dying after he grabbed a large electric dynamo led Buffalo, <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>dentist</b> Alfred P. Southwick to seek some application for the curious phenomenon. He worked with local physician George E. Fell and the Buffalo ASPCA electrocuting hundreds of dogs {{to come up with}} a method to euthanize animals via electricity. Southwick's 1882 and 1883 articles on how electrocution could be a replacement for hanging, using a restraint similar to a dental chair (an electric chair) caught the attention of New York State politicians who, following a series of botched hangings, were desperately seeking an alternative. An 1886 commission appointed by New York governor David B. Hill, which including Southwick, recommended in 1888 that executions be carried out by electricity using the electric chair.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the same}} time that Brown was campaigning against {{alternating}} current a New York state bill replacing hanging with electrocution was signed into law (June 4, 1888) and set to go into effect on January 1, 1889. A Buffalo, <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>dentist</b> named Alfred P. Southwick had been developing a method using a device similar to a dental chair, an execution device referred to as the electric chair. The law did not specify the type of current to use, or the means, so the New York Medico-Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of working out the details. Committee head Frederick Peterson, a neurologist who had assisted in the dog electrocutions at Columbia College, enlisted Brown's services as a consultant. Brown set up an experiment at Edison's West Orange laboratory on December 5, 1888 with members of the press, members of the Medico-Legal Society, the chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC. Based on these results the Medico-Legal Society recommended the use of 1000-1500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities.|$|E

He was tried and convicted of murder on May 10, 1889. On May 13 he was {{sentence}}d to death. As of January first of that year New York had instituted death by electrocution, the first such law ever. Kemmler's sentence was to be carried out at New York's Auburn Prison via the new electric chair, a device invented in 1881 by Buffalo, <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>dentist</b> Alfred Southwick which, after nine years of development and legislation, was ready for use. Kemmler's lawyers appealed, arguing that electrocution was cruel and unusual punishment. The attempt to carry out Kemmler's execution was pulled into the AC/DC war of currents between George Westinghouse, the largest supplier of alternating current equipment, and Thomas Edison, whose company ran their equipment on direct current. The alternating current that powered the electric chair (a current standard adopted by a committee after a demonstration performed at Edison's laboratory by anti-AC activist Harold P. Brown showing AC's lethality) was supplied by a Westinghouse generator surreptitiously acquired by Brown. This led to Westinghouse trying to stop what seemed to be Brown and Edison's attempt to try to portray the AC used in Westinghouse electrical system as the deadly [...] "executioners current", actively supporting Kemmler's appeal by hiring lawyer W. Bourke Cockran to represent him. However, the appeal failed on October 9, 1889 and the U.S. Supreme Court turned down the case on the grounds that there was no cruel and unusual punishment in death by electrocution.|$|E

5000|$|In autumn 1953, McCarthy's {{committee}} {{began its}} ill-fated {{inquiry into the}} United States Army. This began with McCarthy opening {{an investigation into the}} Army Signal Corps laboratory at Fort Monmouth. McCarthy, newly married to Jean Kerr, cut short his honeymoon to open the investigation. He garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the Army researchers, but after weeks of hearings, nothing came of his investigations. Unable to expose any signs of subversion, McCarthy focused instead on the case of Irving Peress, a <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>dentist</b> who had been drafted into the Army in 1952 and promoted to major in November 1953. Shortly thereafter it {{came to the attention of}} the military bureaucracy that Peress, who was a member of the left-wing American Labor Party, had declined to answer questions about his political affiliations on a loyalty-review form. Peress' superiors were therefore ordered to discharge him from the Army within 90 days. McCarthy subpoenaed Peress to appear before his subcommittee on January 30, 1954. Peress refused to answer McCarthy's questions, citing his rights under the Fifth Amendment. McCarthy responded by sending a message to Secretary of the Army, Robert T. Stevens, demanding that Peress be court-martialed. On that same day, Peress asked for his pending discharge from the Army to be effected immediately, and the next day Brigadier General Ralph W. Zwicker, his commanding officer at Camp Kilmer in New Jersey, gave him an honorable separation from the Army. At McCarthy's encouragement, [...] "Who promoted Peress?" [...] became a rallying cry among many anti-communists and McCarthy supporters. In fact, and as McCarthy knew, Peress had been promoted automatically through the provisions of the Doctor Draft Law, for which McCarthy had voted.|$|E
5000|$|The idea of {{execution}} by electricity, electrocution, {{grew out of}} the introduction of the electric chair in the late 1890s as an official method of capital punishment in the United States state of New York, thought to be a more humane alternative to hanging. People had been dying (accidentally) from electric shock in the decade before the introduction of the electric chair with the first recorded accidental death by electricity (besides lightning strikes) occurring in 1879 when a stage carpenter in Lyon, France touched a 250-volt wire. The spread of arc light based street lighting systems led to many people dying from coming in contact with the high-voltage lines being used, which seemed to kill instantaneously without leaving a mark on the victim. After an 1881 death, a Buffalo, <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>dentist</b> Alfred P. Southwick sought to develop this phenomenon into a way to execute condemned criminals with him basing his device on form he knew well, a dental chair. The next 9 years saw promotion by Southwick, the New York state Gerry commission (which included Southwick) recommending execution by electricity, a June 4, 1888 law making it the state form {{of execution}} on January 2, 1889, and a further state committee of doctors and lawyers to finalize the details of the method used. The adoption of the electric chair became mixed up in the [...] "war of currents" [...] between Thomas Edison's direct current system and industrialist George Westinghouse's alternating current system in 1889 when noted anti-AC activist Harold P. Brown became a consultant to the committee. Brown pushed, with the assistance and sometimes collusion of Edison Electric and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, for the successful adoption of alternating current to power the chair, an attempt to portray AC as a public menace and the [...] "executioners current".|$|E
