60|$|The {{darkness}} was intense.

He {{did not think}} that he could walk; but to prolong the {{experience}} of the previous <b>night</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> twenty-four hours or more seemed even worse. He ate his breakfast; and then with a tense effort he got upon his feet and slipped the straps of the pack over his shoulders. Moving unevenly, he set off, lest he should yield to his weariness and sink down again.|$|E

Schodowski {{replaced}} Wells with new co-host [...] "Lil' John" [...] Rinaldi and continued the Friday <b>night</b> show <b>for</b> <b>another</b> 28 years as The Big Chuck and Lil' John Show, finally ending in 2007 after a combined total run of 40 years.|$|R
25|$|This {{game was}} {{originally}} scheduled {{to kick off}} at 8:00 pm on Friday, October 5, and {{it was to have}} been the first night game played by Alabama in their history. After a mutual agreement was reached between both head coaches, the game was postponed to the following afternoon {{as a result of a}} major rain event that made the playing surface at the Cramton Bowl unplayable. The Crimson Tide would not compete in their first <b>night</b> game <b>for</b> <b>another</b> six seasons when they defeated Spring Hill to open the 1940 season.|$|R
60|$|Familiarity {{with danger}} begets at last a certain callous indifference. Muriel was {{surprised}} {{in her own}} mind to discover how easily they could chat with M. Peyron on such indifferent subjects, with that awful doom of an approaching death hanging over them so shortly. But the fact was, terrors of every kind had so encompassed them round since their arrival on the island that the mere additional certainty of a date and mode of execution was rather a relief to their minds than otherwise. It partook {{of the nature of}} a reprieve, not of a sentence. Besides, this meeting with another speaker of a European tongue seemed to them so full of promise and hope that they almost forgot the terrors of their threatened end in their discussion of possible schemes for escape to freedom. Even M. Peyron himself, who had spent nine long years of exile in the island, felt that the arrival of two new Europeans gave him some hope of effecting at last his own retreat from this unendurable position. His talk was all of passing steamers. If the Australasian had come near enough once to sight the island, he argued, then the homeward-bound vessel, en route for Honolulu, must have begun to take a new course considerably to the eastward of the old navigable channel. If this were so, their obvious plan was to keep a watch, day and <b>night,</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> passing Australian liner, and whenever one hove in sight, to steal away to the shore, seize a stray canoe, overpower, if possible, their Shadows, or give them the slip, and make one bold stroke for freedom on the open ocean.|$|E

She calls at <b>night,</b> begging <b>for</b> <b>another</b> chance, but is refused. Though he denies any intention to see her, Ed checks up on Lorie and punches out {{a man who was}} harassing her. Feeling trapped, Ed entertains and eventually sleeps with Lorie again. He resolves to break it off the next day, but she calls throughout the night, phoning everyone she knows when he doesn't answer. Andie, Ed's daughter, convinces him to be harsh, and he informs Lorie that she needs to leave him alone or he'll change his number.|$|R
50|$|The {{victims of}} the final murders were the family of Harvey Wilkerson, a {{longtime}} friend of the brothers. On the morning of October 19, despite having promised a judge earlier that day that he would stay out of trouble while out on parole, James led his brothers on the prowl that <b>night</b> <b>for</b> yet <b>another</b> victim. Upon seeing the brothers down the street, Wilkerson, who lived with his 23-year-old wife Judy Barton (who was five months pregnant at the time) and her 5-year-old son Harvey, instinctively closed and locked his door. This action was noticed by the brothers, who then walked over to Wilkerson's front door. Terrified by their response if he refused them entry, Wilkerson allowed them in.|$|R
25|$|Victor Fontan (born Pau, France, 18 June 1892, died Saint-Vincent 2 January 1982) was a French cyclist {{who led the}} 1929 Tour de France but {{dropped out}} after {{knocking}} at doors at <b>night</b> to ask <b>for</b> <b>another</b> bicycle.

5000|$|As a young {{teacher in}} the {{segregated}} Todd County School system, Dunnigan taught courses in Kentucky history. She quickly learned that her students were almost completely ignorant of the historic contributions of African Americans {{to the state of}} Kentucky. She started preparing [...] "Kentucky Fact Sheets" [...] and handing them out to her students as supplements to the required text. These papers were collected for publication in 1939, but no publisher was willing to take them to press. Associated Publishers Inc. finally published the articles in 1982 as The Fascinating Story of Black Kentuckians: Their Heritage and Tradition. The meager pay she earned teaching forced her to work numerous menial jobs during the summer months, when school was not in session. She washed the tombstones in the white cemetery while working four hours a day in a dairy, cleaning house for a family, and doing washing at <b>night</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> family, earning a total of about seven dollars a week.|$|E
40|$|While visiting {{our kids}} and {{grandson}} last year, I had a recurring thought: being a grandparent is not for 'sissies'. My wife and I thought about how grandparenting challenged our health; each day saw some insult to body homeostasis and we were grateful each <b>night</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> day survived. Don't get me wrong, we wouldn't trade days with our little man for all the gold in China or the USA, but I came to think that grandparents are special people, not for giving love or gifts, but for putting our bodies on the line.

Only enchantment, he was afterwards heard to declare (though none of his friends believed him), could have given him the appetite he possessed on that extraordinary <b>night.</b> He called <b>for</b> <b>another</b> pork-chop and potatoes, then for pickled salmon; then he thought he would try a devilled turkey-wing.

2500|$|In March 1950, {{producers}} of the new game show What's My Line? hired Block for its fourth episode to add humor to the show's format. With a panel previously consisting of journalists, a politician and a poet, reviewers had criticized the show as bland. After a rocky start, What's My Line? {{became one of the}} top-rated shows on television. Critics praised his work; the Chicago Sun-Times called Block the [...] "freshest new personality in TV." [...] However, Block sometimes seemed to lack a sense of propriety; his humor could be risqué, which antagonized some conservative 1950s viewers. He once risked the sponsor's wrath, referring to their deodorant with the line [...] "Make your armpit a charmpit." [...] In early 1953, Block was suspended and then fired. He left show business for the investment business a few years later, while What's My Line? continued on as a staple of Sunday <b>night</b> television <b>for</b> <b>another</b> 14 years.|$|R

25|$|While Bảo Đại's State of Vietnam (formerly Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina) had the Vietnamese National Army {{supporting}} the French forces, some minorities were trained and organized as regular battalions (mostly infantry tirailleurs) that fought with French forces against the Viet Minh. The Tai Battalion 2 (BT2, 2e Bataillon Thai) is infamous for its desertion {{during the siege}} of Dien Bien Phu. Propaganda leaflets written in Tai and French sent by the Viet Minh {{were found in the}} deserted positions and trenches. Such deserters were called the Nam Yum rats by Bigeard during the siege, as they hid close to the Nam Yum river during the day and searched at <b>night</b> <b>for</b> supply drops. <b>Another</b> allied minority was the Muong people (Mường).

40|$|Although females rarely {{experience}} strong mate limitation, delays or lifelong {{problems of}} mate acquisition are detrimental to female fitness. In systems where males search for females via pheromone plumes, {{it is often}} difficult to assess whether female signaling is costly. Direct costs include the energetics of pheromone production and attention from unwanted eavesdroppers, such as parasites, parasitoids, and predators. Suboptimal outcomes are also possible from too many or too few mating events or near-simultaneous arrival of males who make unwanted mating attempts (even if successfully thwarted). We show that, in theory, even small costs can lead to a scenario where young females signal less intensely (lower pheromone concentration and/or shorter time spent signaling) and increase signaling effort only as they age and gather evidence (while still virgin) on whether sperm limitation threatens their reproductive success. Our synthesis of the empirical data available on Lepidoptera supports this prediction for one frequently reported component of signaling—time spent calling (often reported as the time of onset of calling at <b>night)</b> —but not <b>for</b> <b>another,</b> pheromone titer. This difference is explicable under the plausible but currently untested assumption that signaling earlier than other females each night is a more reliable way of increasing the probability of acquiring at least one mate than producing a more concentrated pheromone plume. 16 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{story of}} the five Marlow {{brothers}} and their tribulations in late nineteenth-century Texas {{is the stuff of}} Old West legend (and served to inspire the John Wayne movie, The Sons of Katie Elder). Violent, full of intrigue, with characters of amazing heroism and deplorable cowardice, their story was first related by William Rathmell in Life of the Marlows, a little book published in 1892, shortly after the events it described in Young County, Texas. It told how Boone, the most reckless of the brothers, shot and killed a popular sheriff and escaped, only to be murdered later by bounty hunters. The other four brothers, arrested as accessories and jailed, made a daring break from confinement but were recaptured. Once back in their cells, they were forced to fight off a mob intent on lynching them. Later, shackled together, the Marlows were placed on wagons by officers late at <b>night,</b> bound <b>for</b> <b>another</b> town, but they were ambushed by angry citizens. In the resulting battle two of the brothers were shot and killed, the other two severely wounded, and three mob members died. The surviving brothers eventually were exonerated, but members of the mob that had attacked them were prosecuted in cases that {{went all the way to}} the U. S. Supreme Court. The original 1892 edition and expanded reprint of 1931 are both quite scarce. Later writers drew upon Rathmell’s account when telling the {{story of the}} Marlows, but all accounts were slanted sympathetically toward them, given the same bias by Rathmell. Now Robert K. DeArment, a noted historian of outlaws and lawmen of the West, has sifted through the evidence and presents herein an objective, annotated edition of Life of the Marlows, which contains extensive clarifying and corrective footnotes and an index. Now the complete story can be told and readers can judge for themselves: were the Marlows as law-abiding as Rathmell claims? Or was the mob reacting with justified anger...|$|R
