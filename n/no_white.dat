5|$|Several {{species of}} duck have brown-plumaged females {{that can be}} {{confused}} with the female mallard. The female gadwall (A.strepera) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white speculum that is seen as a white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to the female mallard in North America are the American black duck (A.rubripes), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (A.fulvigula), which is somewhat darker than the female mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and <b>no</b> <b>white</b> edge on the speculum.|$|E
5|$|The first Southern Rhodesian {{contingent}} despatched to North Africa and the Middle East was a {{draft of}} 700 from the Rhodesia Regiment who left in April 1940. <b>No</b> <b>white</b> Rhodesian force of this size had ever left the territory before. They were posted {{to a variety of}} British units across Egypt and Palestine. The largest concentration of Rhodesian soldiers in North Africa belonged to the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), whose connections with the colony dated back to World War I. Several Rhodesian platoons were formed in the KRRC's 1st Battalion in the Western Desert. A company of men from the Southern Rhodesian Signal Corps was also present, operating in tandem with the British Royal Corps of Signals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white {{markings}} and whorls were considered to be indicators of character and good or bad luck. Horses with white socks on their feet were considered to have good or bad luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with <b>no</b> <b>white</b> markings at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were considered to show good or bad luck, with the most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage and good luck.|$|E

25|$|The {{subspecies}} {{differ in}} their size, the amount of white on their plumage and the colour of the gloss on their black feathers. The northwest African race P. p. mauritanica differs from the nominate subspecies in having a patch of blue bare skin behind the eye, <b>no</b> <b>white</b> patch on the rump, and a longer tail. The southwest Arabian race P. p. asirensis differs in having more black in the plumage with a narrower white scapular patch, <b>no</b> <b>white</b> rump, and smaller white areas on the primaries. The Asian race P. p. bactriana has more extensive white on the primaries and a prominent white rump.|$|E

25|$|The Irish Terrier is {{coloured}} golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten. Dark red {{is often}} mistaken {{as the only}} correct colour, possibly because wheaten coats are often of worse quality.

As an Irish Terrier grows older, grey hair may appear here and there.|$|E
25|$|Collectively, {{these attacks}} served to spread fear {{throughout}} the region, especially in northeastern Illinois {{around the area}} of the Indian Creek massacre where a wave of terror gripped the region.

25|$|It {{is common}} for a Toller {{to have at least}} one of the {{following}} white markings: tip of tail, feet (not extending above the pasterns), and chest.

25|$|At first, only African Americans {{were buying}} R discs.

For example, 40% of 1952 sales at Dolphin's of Hollywood record shop, located in an African-American area of Los Angeles, were to whites. Eventually, white teens across the country turned their music taste towards rhythm and blues.|$|E
25|$|The most iconic {{aspect of}} the Papillon is its ears which are large and well fringed, giving them a {{butterfly}} wing-like appearance. Papillons are particolored or white with patches of any color. An all-white dog or a dog with <b>no</b> <b>white</b> is disqualified from the conformation show ring. A blaze (area of white extending down between the eyes) and noseband is preferred over a solid-colored head, but not required. Nose, eye rims, and lips should be black. Paw pads vary in color from black to pink, depending on the coloring of the dog.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} island {{groups of}} Miyako and Yaeyama {{are known for}} their peculiar archaeological development: a pottery culture was followed by a potteryless culture and then by another pottery culture. Kamuiyaki, together with white glazed wares, soapstone cauldrons and brown glazed wares, were found at the Ōdomaribama Site (circa 12th century) of Hateruma, the Yaeyama Islands, which Okinawan archaeologists consider represents the final stage of the potteryless culture. The Sumiya Site of Miyako Island has kamuiyaki and soapstone cauldrons but <b>no</b> <b>white</b> glazed ware. Kamuiyaki were excavated more often in Miyako than in Yaeyama.|$|E

25|$|The {{wilderness}} {{west of the}} Cuyahoga River {{was delayed}} being settled due to a treaty the federal government made with the Indians in 1785, whereby <b>no</b> <b>white</b> man was to settle on that land. Consequently, when Moses Cleaveland arrived in 1796, his activities were confined to {{the east side of}} the river. Subsequently, in Detroit, Michigan, on January 18, 1796, twenty-nine leaders of the Ottawa, Chippewa, and other tribes signed another treaty that provided for the lease of the lands west of the Cuyahoga River for 999 years for the sum of five shillings per acre.|$|E

25|$|Soothsayer was a large, golden {{chestnut}} horse with <b>no</b> <b>white</b> markings bred in Yorkshire by his owner Richard Oliver Gascoigne. His sire, Sorcerer, was bred by Sir Charles Bunbury {{and was a}} half-brother of the 1801 Derby winning mare Eleanor. Sorcerer was an unusually large black horse who won several important races and became a successful breeding stallion. His progeny included the Derby winner Smolensko, the 2000 Guineas winners Wizard and Trophonius, and the Oaks winners Morel, Maid of Orleans and Sorcery. Sorcerer was the Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1811, 1812 and 1813.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of white Siberian tigers {{has not been}} scientifically documented, despite occasional unsubstantiated reports of sightings of white tigers in the regions where wild Siberian tigers live. It {{may be that the}} white mutation does not exist in the wild Siberian tiger population: <b>no</b> <b>white</b> Siberian tigers have been born in captivity, {{despite the fact that the}} subspecies has been extensively bred during the last few decades (with much outbreeding between the different Siberian lineages for purposes of conservation genetics); a recessive allele should occasionally turn up in a homozygous state during such breeding, and in this particular case yield white tigers from normally-colored parents, but no such animals have been reported.|$|E
25|$|The wing bar {{is unique}} among living {{whistling}} ducks. When on the ground, {{it may be}} hard to discern the light flanks present in many of these waterfowl. The fulvous whistling duck (D. bicolor) is the only sympatric whistling duck that shows such a whitish flank stripe, and it differs from the black-bellied by having dark wings and a lighter belly {{rather than the other way}} around. Juvenile D. autumnalis are quite similar to young of the white-faced whistling duck (D. viduata), which have a darker bill and <b>no</b> <b>white</b> wing patch; even when sitting they never seem to show white along the sides, as their thin white vertical barring on the black flanks is very indistinct.|$|E
