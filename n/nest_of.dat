5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} is {{socially}} monogamous. Conspecific or intraspecific brood parasitism, where the female lays {{eggs in the}} <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> others of their own species is common with nearly 40% of nests being parasitized on average. In terms of territory, this grebe will only defend its nest site.|$|E
5|$|Choughs are monogamous, {{and show}} high partner and site fidelity. Both species build a bulky <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> roots, sticks and plant stems lined with grass, fine twiglets or hair. It is {{constructed}} on a ledge, {{in a cave}} or similar fissure in a cliff face, or in man-made locations like abandoned buildings, quarries or dams. Red-billed will also sometimes use occupied buildings such as Mongolian monasteries. The choughs are not colonial, although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity.|$|E
5|$|Helpers, {{offspring}} {{from the}} previous brood, have sometimes been noted to assist in feeding the fledglings at the <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> their parents. Cases of brood parasitism by the Asian koel have been noted. An average breeding success of 44% has been noted with {{the main cause of}} fledgling mortality being shortage of insect food which in turn was dependent on rainfall.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian tree sparrow's untidy nest {{is built}} in a natural cavity, a hole in a {{building}} or the large <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> a European magpie or white stork. The typical clutch is five or six eggs which hatch in under two weeks. This sparrow feeds mainly on seeds, but invertebrates are also consumed, particularly during the breeding season. As with other small birds, infection by parasites and diseases, and predation by birds of prey take their toll, and the typical life span is about two years.|$|E
5|$|The argasid tick Hyalomma marginatum {{was found}} in pale crag martin nests on a {{sarcophagus}} and an ancient tomb in Egypt. This tick has been implicated in the transmission of Bahig virus, a pathogenic arbovirus previously thought to be transmitted only by mosquitoes. Another argasid tick, Argas africolumbae, {{was found in}} a <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> the closely related rock martins in Kenya.

5|$|The curve-billed thrasher can {{generally}} be found running rapidly from {{cover to cover}} or flying near ground level from bush to bush. However, this bird is not shy about being in the open. It is generally a forager on ground level but can be very aggressive in routing out potential competitors for food at feeders, such as the Inca dove and round-tailed ground squirrel. It will usually destroy any <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> cactus wrens.|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} tissue {{maceration}} to quantitate interstitial cell nests in Hydra attenuata and thiolacetic acid-lead nitrate staining to quantitate differentiating nematocytes. Most I-cell nests have 2, 4, 8, or 16 cells. Differentiating nematocytes occur in <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> 4, 8, 16, and 32. All classes <b>of</b> I-cell <b>nests</b> and <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> dilferentiating nematocytes are {{abundant in the}} gastric region. In contrast, the hypostome, basal disk and the regions immediately adjacent to them have no <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> differentiating nematocytes, virtually no <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> 4, 8, or 16 I-cells and reduced numbers of 1 and 2 I-cell nesls. Since <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> 4 or more I-cells are found only where nematocyte differentiation takes place, these nest classes are probably nematocyte precursors. Since differentiation of nerves occurs in the hypostome and basal disk where only single or paired I-cells are found, these size classes include nerve precursors. The disproportionately large number <b>of</b> I-cell <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> 2 suggests that these include the autoreproductive stem cells responsible for maintaining the populations of I-cell derivatives in growing hydra. ...|$|R
40|$|Field {{observations}} and rearing observations <b>of</b> five <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> Macromerella honesta (Smith) and four <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> Auplopus sp. {{were carried out}} in Hong Kong, China, in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2012. <b>Nests</b> <b>of</b> Macromerella honesta were composed of two rows of exposed ovoid mud cells, affixed to broad leafs while <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> Auplopus sp. were constructed as variable masses of mortar affixed to a linear substrate (thorns, wire-mesh, etc.) Cells <b>of</b> the <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> Auplopus sp. {{were more or less}} cylindrical and covered with a layer of hardened mud finished with a plant gum coating. Both species used a single dismembered spider, transported ventrally to the nesting site, for cell provisioning. Active guarding was observed at all <b>nesting</b> sites. Overlap <b>of</b> generation was also recorded with active nest cooperation (construction and prey provisioning) between individuals of different generations on the same nesting site.

5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites live almost {{exclusively}} on mice, and have become a specialist predator of house mice, often following outbreaks of mouse plagues in rural areas. They take other suitably sized creatures when available, including grasshoppers, rats, small reptiles, birds, and even (very rarely) rabbits, but mice and other mouse-sized mammals account for over 90% of their diet. Their influence on mouse populations is probably significant: adults take two or three mice a day each if they can, around a thousand mice a year. On one occasion, a male was observed bringing no less than 14 mice to a <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> well-advanced fledglings within an hour. In another study, a female kite was seen to struggle back to fledglings in the nest with a three-quarters grown rabbit, a heavy load for such a small bird.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{typically}} {{breed in}} small groups: the Mascarene martin builds a shallow cup <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> twigs and coarse plant material {{with a soft}} inner lining, whereas Brazza's martin makes a small heap of soft material such as feathers or dry grass {{at the end of}} a typically 50-cm (20-in) tunnel in a riverbank. The normal clutch is three eggs for Brazza's martin, two for Mascarene martins on Madagascar and Mauritius, and two or three for those on Réunion. As with other swallows, both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species groups or with other swallows and swifts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nests</b> <b>of</b> the {{southern}} race {{have been found}} in Brazil in September and from November to early January. They are placed on a hillock between swamps, and 2-4 eggs are laid. No <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> the nominate subspecies have been found.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Forty-two <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> the Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) and 78 <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> the Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaieensis) were {{surveyed}} during a three-year ecological study (1982 – 84). In 11 instances <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> {{the two species}} overlapped the hunting areas of the other. Home ranges, in which most hunting takes place, have been defined by various authors (Miller, 1930; Baumgartner, 1939; Hagar, 1967). For this study Hawks and Owls nesting within one-half mile of each other were compared. The proximity <b>nesting</b> <b>of</b> these two species seemed likely to increase the possibility of predation upon the young of the other, as has been previously suggested (Craighead and Craighead, 1956; Fitch, 1940; Orians and Kuhlman, 1956; Seidensticker and Reynolds, 1971; Mclnvaille and Keith, 1974) ...|$|R
5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> the mated male. Unmated males {{are also more likely to}} use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic ant species {{enter the}} colonies of host ants and {{establish}} themselves as social parasites; {{species such as}} Strumigenys xenos are entirely parasitic {{and do not have}} workers, but instead, rely on the food gathered by their Strumigenys perplexa hosts. This form of parasitism is seen across many ant genera, but the parasitic ant is usually a species that is closely related to its host. A variety of methods are employed to enter the <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> the host ant. A parasitic queen may enter the host nest before the first brood has hatched, establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent. Other species use pheromones to confuse the host ants or to trick them into carrying the parasitic queen into the nest. Some simply fight their way into the nest.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield (from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe) {{contains}} {{a scene where}} the grandfather {{as a young man}} is reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's tail-piece woodcut for the partridge. The woodcut shows a reaper with a scythe, a dead bird and its <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe, which has just lifted. George Ewart Evans used the image on the title page of his 1956 book about Blaxhall (near Charsfield, on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).|$|E

50|$|B. impatiens have {{underground}} nests {{that are}} 1-3 {{feet below the}} ground surface. They enter their nests using tunnels that are 18 inches to 9 feet long. Unlike the <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> honeybees or paper wasps, the <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> B. impatiens {{do not have a}} predictable pattern.

5|$|Species of the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina are {{generally}} considered epizoic, or {{living on the}} outside of other animals, mainly mammals. In the Arixeniina, family Arixeniidae, species of the genus Arixenia are normally found deep in the skin folds and gular pouch of Malaysian hairless bulldog bats (Cheiromeles torquatus), apparently feeding on bats' body or glandular secretions. On the other hand, species in the genus Xeniaria (still of the suborder Arixeniina) are believed to feed on the guano and possibly the guanophilous arthropods in the bat's nest, where it has been found. Hemimerina includes Araeomerus found in the <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> Long-tailed pouch rats (Beamys), and Hemimerus which are found on Giant Cricetomys rats.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake's {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} grassland, particularly hayfields, and it uses similar environments on the wintering grounds. This secretive species builds a <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> grass leaves in a hollow {{in the ground}} and lays 6–14 cream-coloured eggs which are covered with rufous blotches. These hatch in 19–20 days, and the black precocial chicks fledge after about five weeks. This crake is in steep decline across much of its former breeding range because modern farming practices often destroy nests before breeding is completed. The corn crake is omnivorous but mainly feeds on invertebrates, the occasional small frog or mammal, and plant material including grass seed and cereal grain. Natural threats include introduced and feral mammals, large birds, various parasites and diseases.|$|E
5|$|The <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> the dusky woodswallow {{consists}} of twigs, roots {{and other similar}} foliage matted {{together to form a}} bowl shape, which is lined with grass. It is positioned safely, behind bark, and/or high in a tree branch, and sometimes in a hollowed out tree stump. The nest is made during the period from August to January, {{and with the help of}} several birds. The mated pair will then guard the nest, while others will help them take care of the babies. The female lays white eggs, of which there are usually no more than three or four. While the incubation period lasts for sixteen days, the amount of time taken for fledgling can be this long to around twenty days.|$|E
50|$|Black-billed cuckoos {{are known}} to lay their eggs in the <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> other birds. They can lay eggs in the <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> other black-billed cuckoos, called conspecific parasitism, or in the <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> other songbirds, known as {{interspecific}} parasitism. The females will usually parasitize nests in the afternoon because the nests are often unguarded at this time. This cuckoo species {{is thought to have}} a laying interval of about a day so if two eggs show up in a nest on the same day, you can rightfully assume that one is a parasitic egg.|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} host of Melittoboa australica was Pison spinolae, however, the primary hosts are leaf cutting bees Megachile spp, mason wasps and mud dauber wasps {{but it is}} catholic in its choice of hosts.

5|$|After rescuing the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it {{initially}} fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, also mistaking {{it for a}} real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik {{in retaliation}} and says that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper kidnaps Flik and flees. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering it is real, and is captured and fed to its chicks.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps {{are caught}} by Eurasian sparrowhawks in the {{breeding}} range, and by Eleonora's falcons on migration. Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take eggs and young, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. Domestic cats {{are the most}} important predator, possibly killing up to 10% of blackcaps. Blackcaps are occasionally hosts of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The level of parasitism is low because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected. Blackcaps have evolved adaptations which make it difficult for the parasitic species to succeed, despite the cuckoo's tendency to lay eggs which resemble those of their host. Blackcaps are good at spotting alien eggs, and their own eggs are very alike within a clutch, making it easier to spot the intruder. There is, however, considerable variation between different clutches, making it harder for the cuckoo to convincingly mimic a blackcap egg. The open habitat and cup <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> the warbler make it a potential target for the cuckoo; it may have experienced much higher levels of parasitism in the past, and countermeasures would have spread rapidly once they evolved.|$|E
5|$|Cape sparrows {{primarily}} eat seeds, {{and also}} eat soft plant parts and insects. They typically breed in colonies, and when not breeding they gather in large nomadic flocks {{to move around}} in search of food. The nest can be constructed in a tree, a bush, a cavity, or a disused <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> another species. A typical clutch contains three or four eggs, and both parents are involved in breeding, from nest building to feeding young. The Cape sparrow is common in most of its range and coexists successfully in urban habitats with two of its relatives, the native southern grey-headed sparrow and the house sparrow, an introduced species. The Cape sparrow's population has not been recorded decreasing significantly, {{and it is not}} seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
