Electrolyte layers (26, 28) positioned between each monoplate are included to provide a battery cell having four sides which is capable of being electrically charged and discharged. Two vertical positive bus bars (42, 43) are provided {{on opposite sides of}} the battery cell for connecting the monoplates (10) with positive active material together in parallel current conducting relation. In addition, two <b>negative</b> <b>bus</b> bars (38, 39) {{on opposite sides of the}} battery cell each being adjacent the positive bus bars are provided for connecting the monoplates (20) with negative active material together in parallel current conducting relation. The positive (42, 43) and negative (38, 39) bus bars not only provide a low resistance method for connecting the plurality of conductive monoplates of their respective battery terminals (36, 34) but also provides support and structural strength to the battery cell structure. In addition, horizontal orientation of monoplates (10, 20) is provided in a vertical stacking arrangement to reduce electrolyte stratification and short circuiting due to flaking of positive and negative active materials from the monoplates...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-phase}} two-level {{voltage source}} converter (VSC) is widely employed in power conversions between AC and DC for its four-quadrant operation and control flexibility. However, it {{suffers from the}} low output voltage range with a peak value of half DC-link per phase, which necessitates the use of either high DC-link voltage or bulky step-up transformer to enable the medium voltage operation. Additionally, the high common mode (CM) voltage between AC loads neutral points and ground may reduce the service life and reliability of electric machinery. In this paper, a three-phase AC side voltage-doubling VSC topology with intrinsic Buck-Boost cell is analyzed. By this configuration, the AC side voltage is doubled with the phase peak value equal to DC-link. That is, {{only half of the}} DC side capacitor bank is needed to generate the same output voltage. The proposed converter uses its buck-boost cell as a virtual voltage source to synthesize negative half of the output voltage by modulating its output AC phase voltage around the <b>negative</b> <b>bus</b> (which is the real zero when grounded). This permits the average CM voltage to be suppressed to zero, and loads connected to converter AC side not to withstand any DC voltage stress (reducing the insulation requirement). Modeling and control design for both rectifier and inverter modes of this converter in synchronous reference frame have been investigated to ensure a four-quadrant three-phase back-to-back system. Experimental results have verified the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed configuration and the designed control strategies...|$|E
50|$|A {{relatively}} new class called multilevel inverters has gained widespread interest.

For this reason multilevel inverters, although more complex and costly, offer higher performance. A three-level neutral-clamped inverter is shown in Figure 10.|$|R

In the proposed algorithm in each sector any one of the phases is clamped to either positive dc <b>bus</b> or <b>negative</b> dc <b>bus.</b> Hence, the proposed algorithm reduces the switching frequency and switching losses of the inverter.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{configuration}} for static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) {{based on the}} ac-side voltage doubling voltage source converter (ACVD-VSC), which has twice of the dc-link voltage utilization as two-level VSC, hence improved power density per unit dc-link voltage. This means its dc voltage limit for reactive power generation is higher than that using conventional two-level VSC. Therefore, extended reactive power control range is resulted for the proposed solution. Also the ACVD converter has zero dc common mode voltage between the ac neutral point and the dc-link negative terminal, reducing the insulation level for the interfacing transformer when the <b>negative</b> dc <b>bus</b> is grounded. The basic operation principles of ACVD-VSC are reviewed. Then, {{it is used to}} perform voltage or power flow control as shunt compensators...|$|R
40|$|The Shared/Common bus {{operation}} of AC drives is becoming popular in many industrial applications due to it's advantages such as cost reduction, reduced space requirements, and improved reliability. Depending {{on the application}} requirements, there are presently two methods to interconnect DC buses of AC drives; Shared-bus and common-bus. Very little or no {{work has been done}} in analyzing the use of such system configurations in industrial applications. In a shared-bus configuration, complete drive units are connected through dc bus fuses to form a common bus. These schemes require individual devices for protection and control, and still may cause bus fuse failures due to poor coordination among each drive's DC bus precharge circuits consisting of different converter front ends, such as diode and SCR. During the normal motoring {{operation of}} such systems, the proper load sharing of input converters must also be ensured, not to cause any device failures or nuisance tripping by exceeding the front end converter ratings. This may also require additional hardware between positive and <b>negative</b> <b>busses</b> depending upon the precharge configurations. The common bus drive systems used in a coordinated system can also be beneficial to user by using regenerative energy of larger drives to supply the other small drives which are motoring. The reliability of such operations must be ensured by analyzing the system and properly selecting the bus fuse sizes. The other version of common bus configuration is the concept of one large converter supplying many inverters {{to reduce the number of}} supporting components. However, as the number of parallel drives increases it is difficult to select the proper device ratings by testing. Therefore, an analytical method to determine the way of connecting t [...] ...|$|R

Traditional pulse width modulation inverter always requires an extra dc/dc converter to interface the battery in FCHEV’s. Z-source inverter has the capability to boost voltage and invert at single stage itself. By substituting one of the capacitors in the Z-source with a battery and controlling the shoot through duty ratio and modulation index independently, one is {{able to control the}} FC power, output power, and SOC of the battery at the same time. The advantage of <b>negative</b> dc <b>bus</b> type embedded type was reducing the requirement of battery size in vehicular applications. These facts make the proposed Z-source inverter highly desirable for use in FCHEVs, as the cost and complexity is greatly reduced when compared to traditional Z-source inverters.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} discontinuous space vector PWM (DPWM) {{techniques for}} a seven-phase {{voltage source inverter}} (VSI). Space vector model of a seven-phase VSI shows that there exist 128 space vectors with different lengths and maps into fourteen sided polygons. A number of possibilities could arise to implement modulation of inverter legs due to large number of available space voltage vectors. Two strategies are adopted here; one utilising large and two middle sets of space vectors to implement discontinuous space vector PWM. Clamping of legs of inverter to either positive or <b>negative</b> dc <b>bus</b> leads to discontinuity in the switching and consequently offers reduced switching loss modulation strategy. A significant reduction in switching losses can be achieved while employing DPWM in a seven-phase VSI. A generalised method is also proposed to realize the DPWM in a seven-phase VSI. Comparison of continuous and discontinuous PWM is presented in terms of switching current ripple. The experimental set-up is illustrated and the experimental results are presented. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a simplified advanced Pulse width Modulation algorithms for reduced {{common mode voltage}} variations. These algorithms have been developed by using the concept of imaginary switching times and hence did not use angle and sector information. Thus, the proposed algorithms reduce the complexity involved in the existing PWM algorithms. In the conventional SVPWM method, two adjacent states with two zero voltage vectors are utilized to program the output voltage. Every 600 degrees the active voltage vectors change, but the zero state locations are retained. In the AZSPWM methods, the choice and the sequence of active voltage vectors {{are the same as}} in conventional SVPWM. However, instead of the real zero voltage vectors (V 0 and V 7), two active opposite voltage vectors with equal duration are utilized. In the NSPWM algorithm, in each sector any one of the phases is clamped to either positive or <b>negative</b> DC <b>bus</b> for a total of 120 o over a fundamental cycle. Hence, it reduces the switching losses of the inverter and switching frequency of the inverter by 33. 33 %. Among the proposed algorithms, the NSPWM algorithm gives superior performance with reduced switching losses of the inverter. Index Terms—Common mode voltage, induction motor drive...|$|R
40|$|Few {{international}} studies {{have so far}} been conducted in terms of professional drivers' speed compliance in urban areas, and even fewer on professional drivers' compliance with rights of way at pedestrian crossings. The project began with a literature review to identify existing knowledge {{on the role of}} professional drivers in traffic. The municipalities of Luleå, Piteå, Kalix and Älvsbyn in Sweden were contacted for information about the project and for cooperation in the selection of study sites. Speed measurements with a handheld laser were conducted in the urban environment with the focus on commercial vehicles such as buses, trucks, freight services, taxis and service vehicles. In parallel with the speed measurements, video recording was conducted for observational studies of yielding behaviour at pedestrian crossings in the urban environment, with the focus on commercial vehicles. Professional drivers as a group are not clearly distinguished from other drivers regarding compliance with speed limits and, when they differed from other drivers, it was in a <b>negative</b> way. <b>Bus</b> drivers and taxi drivers drove faster than other drivers at sites with maximum speed limit of 30 km/h, and the tendency was that taxi drivers also drove faster on roads with maximum speed limit of 50 km/h. Professional drivers are much like other drivers. This averages that it is common that the relevant rules not are followed, two to three out of ten drivers do not give priority to pedestrians at marked pedestrian crossings.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{examined}} the impact of workplace violence against 109 bus drivers over a 1 -year span. Workplace violence is related to both psychological and work-related consequences.

Majority of them experienced at least moderate levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) problems over the 1 -year span. About 9. 3 % of participants showed a delayed onset of PTSD 6 months after. Furthermore, counter-supportive behaviours and reexposure to violence played important roles in the maintenance of PTSD symptoms over time. Even though PTSD symptoms per se did not relate to bus driver's confidence in coping with aggressive passengers, the immediate post-traumatic reaction—symptoms of acute stress disorder—showed a significant long-term <b>negative</b> effect on <b>bus</b> drivers' confidence in dealing with aggressive passengers 12 months after.

40|$|Data {{from public}} {{transport}} automated data collection (ADC) systems are now {{widely used in}} academic research and are beginning {{to be used for}} planning purposes. ADC systems provide ubiquitous and inexpensive, if limited, data streams for planning purposes. Since ADC data systems have been around for some time and are deployed by many large public transport agencies, the resulting data can be used for before and after impact analyses of changes in the transportation system. This research explores the use of automatically collected data to understand the impacts of a major public transport infrastructure investment on a complex existing network. The research presents the methods, using automatically collected data, to determine the impacts on multiple modes of transportation and the preliminary results {{of the impact of the}} introduction of the East London Line Extension. The East London Line is still in the early stages of growth and first and second order impacts continue to develop. The line is carrying an average of approximately 70, 000 passengers per day and ridership continues to increase monthly. The East London Line is an important public transport crossing of the Thames River and a crucial role as a distributer to and from intersecting rail lines. It was estimated that between 28 to 32 percent of the daily weekday passenger journeys are new journeys to the public transport system. There is a change in ridership on many bus routes that run through the area served by the East London line. A more detailed analysis on four bus routes that run parallel to the East London Line and two bus routes that act as feeder routes show mixed results by route, direction, and time period. The mixed results lead us to believe that based on this preliminary impact analysis, the East London line can have a positive and <b>negative</b> impact on <b>bus</b> ridership but the impacts are most likely route, route segment, time of day, and direction specific. Analysis of disaggregate data showed that journey frequency of East London Line patrons increased at a higher rate than for the control panel. It is clear that ADC system data provides a cost effective means to capture a breath and depth of data suitable for impact analyses. by Albert Ng. Thesis (S.

The intercity bus industry in the United States enjoyed its peak profitability and ridership during World War II. Since that time, the private automobile and air service have taken many of the bus industry's revenues and passengers away. The passage of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 was an effort to decrease operating costs and increase ridership by allowing bus companies to discontinue unprofitable routes, have freedom over the setting of fares, and enter into new, competitive markets. While the actual effects the Bus Regulatory Reform Act has had on the bus industry nationwide have been studied, there has been no analysis of the changes in the intercity bus industry of Texas specifically. The objective of this research was to study the effects the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982 has had on the Texas intercity bus industry. Data were collected on the number of places served by the intercity bus in Texas in the last twenty-three years, to see how the number of locations has changed. Financial operating statistics for bus companies serving Texas were compiled for several years {{both before and after the}} passage of the Act, to determine how regulatory reform has affected the financial status of bus operators. Surveys of both Texas households and Texas bus riders were distributed and compared against the results of similar surveys performed before the Act to determine the differences in attitudes of both the public and bus passengers toward intercity bus service. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Bus Regulatory Reform Act has had an impact on the intercity bus industry in Texas. First, the number of places served by the intercity bus has dropped dramatically, at a rate much greater than the rate at which places were losing service before the Act. Second, the operating ratios (ratio of operating expenses to operating revenues multiplied by 100) of bus companies serving Texas are significantly higher in years following regulatory reform, indicating that the companies have become less profitable. Finally, attitudes of the Texas public and Texas bus riders have become more <b>negative</b> toward intercity <b>bus</b> service. Further research recommended in this area includes an investigation of the effects that Greyhound Lines, Inc. 's recently announced changes (including the introduction of a computerized reservations system and the creation of a "frequent riders" program) have had on Greyhound's profitability and ridership. Because Greyhound is the nation's largest, and only national bus carrier, the results of its restructuring will likely be a harbinger of the fate of the industry as a whole...|$|R
