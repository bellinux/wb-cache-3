5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that. Best thing about it is we’re going to do it whenever we want to do it. There is no deadline right <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record ourselves. So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E
5|$|Right <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. We wondered, {{should we do}} a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E

5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E

25|$|Several of Milne's children's poems {{were set}} to music by the {{composer}} Harold Fraser-Simson. His poems have been parodied many times, including with the books When We Were Rather Older and <b>Now</b> <b>We</b> Are Sixty. The 1963 film The King's Breakfast was based on Milne's poem of the same name.|$|E
25|$|<b>Now</b> <b>we</b> {{only need}} to compute the {{intersection}} of the latter ray with our field of view, to get the pixel which our reflected light ray will hit. Lastly, this pixel is set to an appropriate color, taking into account how the color of the original light source and the one of the sphere are combined by the reflection.|$|E

25|$|The first {{collection}} of stories about the character was the book Winnie-the-Pooh (1926), and {{this was followed by}} The House at Pooh Corner (1928). Milne also included a poem about the bear in the children's verse book When We Were Very Young (1924) and many more in <b>Now</b> <b>We</b> Are Six (1927). All four volumes were illustrated by E. H. Shepard.|$|E
25|$|We {{have made}} {{extraordinary}} progress {{the last couple}} of weeks and have come too far to walk away <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> are fully committed and prepared to work around the clock if that's what it takes to reach a final agreement.

25|$|Wettstein knew 112 {{minuscule}} codices of the Gospels, 58 of the Acts, 60 of St. Paul, and 28 of the Apocalypse. Manuscripts of the Gospels with number 260–469 {{were added}} to the list by Scholz (1794–1852). Gregory in 1908 knew 2292 all minuscule manuscripts of the New Testament. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> have 2911 minuscule codices catalogued by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research (INTF) in Münster.|$|E

25|$|The {{total number}} of tetrads is 24*23*22*21/4! = 23*22*21. Dividing that by 6 gives the number of sextets, 23*11*7 = 1771. Furthermore, a sextet group is a {{subgroup}} of a wreath product of order 6!*(4!)6, whose only prime divisors are 2, 3, and 5. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> know the prime divisors of |M24|. Further analysis would determine {{the order of the}} sextet group and hence |M24|.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, K'inich Kan B'alam I began ambitious projects, {{including}} the Group of the Crosses. Thanks to numerous works begun during his government, <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have portraits of this king, found in various sculptures. His brother succeeded him continuing {{with the same}} enthusiasm of construction and art, reconstructing and enlarging {{the north side of}} the Palace. Thanks to the reign of these three kings, B'aakal had a century of growing and splendor.|$|E
