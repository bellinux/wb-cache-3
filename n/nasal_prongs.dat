40|$|OBJECTIVES—Primary: to {{determine}} whether nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) delivered through binasal prongs results in {{a greater proportion of}} extremely low birthweight infants being successfully extubated, after a period of intermittent positive pressure ventilation, than nasal CPAP delivered by a single <b>nasal</b> <b>prong.</b> Secondary: to evaluate the effect of mode of delivery of nasal CPAP after extubation on the need for endotracheal reintubation, weight gain, rates of feeding intolerance, sepsis, suspected sepsis, cranial ultrasound abnormalities, retinopathy of prematurity, chronic lung disease, and the duration of assisted ventilation and care in the tertiary neonatal unit.  DESIGN AND SETTING—Randomised, controlled, clinical trial conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit of the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.  PATIENTS—Infants of birth weight less than 1000 g, ventilated, requiring < 50 % oxygen and ventilator rate {{less than or equal to}} 20 /minute, and considered by the clinical management team to be ready for extubation.  INTERVENTION—Infants were randomly allocated to receive nasal CPAP delivered through binasal (Hudson) prongs or a single <b>nasal</b> <b>prong.</b>  PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE—Failure of extubation as defined by the following criteria: (a) apnoea (more than one episode/hour over a six hour period or one episode requiring bag and mask ventilation); (b) absolute increase in oxygen requirement greater than 15 % above that required before extubation; (c) respiratory acidosis (pH 6. 67 kPa).  RESULTS—Ten of the 41 (24 %) infants randomised to binasal prongs reached predetermined failure criteria compared with 26 of the 46 (57 %) infants randomised to a single <b>nasal</b> <b>prong</b> (p = 0. 005). Four of 17 (24 %) infants of birth weight less than 800 g extubated to binasal prongs reached failure criteria compared with 14 of 16 (88 %) extubated to a single <b>nasal</b> <b>prong</b> (p < 0. 001). There were no significant differences in any of the secondary outcomes.  CONCLUSIONS—For extremely low birthweight infants ventilated using an endotracheal tube, nasal CPAP delivered through binasal (Hudson) prongs is more effective in preventing failure of extubation than that delivered through a single <b>nasal</b> <b>prong.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} apneic oxygenation with a <b>nasal</b> <b>prong</b> during fiberoptic orotracheal intubation (FOI) in fully relaxed patients, 46 patients, who underwent tympanomastoidectomy under general anesthesia whose intubation lasted more than 3 but less than 4 minutes, were studied. Changes of arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2), arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2) and vital signs were measured every minute. Twenty-three patients who underwent FOI in apneic state without oxygen administration (Group I), showed similar increases in heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to the other 23 patients who received 5 L/min of apneic oxygenation (Group II) with <b>nasal</b> <b>prong.</b> PaCO 2 increased less and PaO 2 decreased less in Group II at 3 minutes. In summary, apneic oxygenation during fiberoptic orotracheal intubation in fully relaxed patients is useful because it could delay the onset of hypoxia and hypercarbia, thereby providing extra time for intubation. And attempts to intubate a fully relaxed patient could probably be kept at least under 3 minutes...|$|R

An occurrence was defined when the <b>nasal</b> <b>prongs</b> were displaced from the nostrils after 3 min in the desired position, requiring intervention of the examiner. ResultsAmong the 16 studied infants, the occurrence of nasal prong displacement was only observed in the prone position (9 infants – 56. 2 %) and in the left lateral position (2 infants – 12. 5 %). The number of times that the prongs were displaced was 11 in the prone position (7 within the first 10 min) and 2 in the left lateral position (1 within the first 10 min).

40|$|In 36 {{severely}} hypoxaemic patients (arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2) {{less than}} 7. 3 kPa or 55 mmHg), candidates for long-term oxygen therapy, {{we compared the}} effectiveness of three oxygen-delivery systems, the standard <b>nasal</b> <b>prongs,</b> a so-called oxygen-conserving reservoir device ("Oxymizer Pendant") and the reference pharyngeal catheter, at a preset flow rate of 2 l. min- 1. After 30 min, the conserving device (OX) was at least as efficient as the pharyngeal catheter (PC) and did significantly better than the <b>nasal</b> <b>prongs</b> (NP), the mean increments in PaO 2 and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) being, respectively, 1. 1 kPa (8. 1 mmHg) and 1. 3 % higher with OX than with NP. Twenty patients did not reach the target level of 8. 6 kPa (65 mmHg) PaO 2 with the <b>nasal</b> <b>prongs,</b> but the reservoir cannula allowed nine of these "refractory" patients to hit this therapeutic goal, a result indicating a clear trend towards improved immediate oxygen response. Although initially designed to spare gas, we suggest that a reservoir cannula could serve another purpose, namely to optimize oxygenation in patients treated by an oxygen concentrator.

40|$|Objectives: Annually, bronchiolitis is a {{major cause}} of {{children}} 2 ̆ 7 s hospital admissions. Children suffering from respiratory distress are provided supplemental oxygen therapy via a headbox. Whilst effective in treating the child physically, the headbox can be very restrictive and limits parental access to their child. This form of oxygen therapy can have a detrimental effect on parental bonding, their relationship with their child, and the parents 2 ̆ 7 ability to fulfil their parenting role. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the lived experiences of parents and nurses who have had or cared for a child admitted to hospital for severe bronchiolitis and received two types of oxygen therapy; headbox oxygen and high flow <b>nasal</b> <b>prong</b> oxygen therapy. This phenomenon has not been investigated previously. Methods: A descriptive phenomenological design was used to interview a purposive sample of 12 parents and 12 nurses. Results: Several themes emerged from data analysis: 1. It was horrific. We didn 2 ̆ 7 t know if she would live or die; 2. I didn 2 ̆ 7 t know what was happening; 3. I think some parents do get quite upset; 4. All that I wanted to do was hold her and keep her with me; 5. I felt inadequate, more than useless; 6. I needed her to feel my heart beat; 7. Look but don 2 ̆ 7 t touch; 8. I stayed with her day and night and; 9. Babies are hard work in the head box because you can 2 ̆ 7 t pick them up. These themes were then divided into three domains; Fear, Parent child interaction, and Technical caring. Conclusions: The mothers found the situation of having a child in a headbox frightening, stating that lack of knowledge and understanding, fear of their child dying, isolation from their child, unfamiliar environments, and the inability to attend to their child 2 ̆ 7 s day-to-day care were all contributing factors.;Some of these fears were present when their child received high flow <b>nasal</b> <b>prong</b> oxygen therapy but the increased interaction with their baby allowed the mothers to feel more useful and less frightened. The nurses in the study recognised to a degree these themes surrounding the parent child relationship yet were more concerned about clinical issues involved with caring for a child in a headbox such as safety and ergonomic restrictions.

Percutaneous transtracheal catheterization Is both oxygen efficient and cosmetically acceptable. As U requires an Invasive surgical procedure with some serious potential complications its use should probably be reserved for those patients In whom adequate oxygenation Is not achieved by standard <b>nasal</b> <b>prongs.</b> Its use Is rarely justified on merely cosmetic grounds.

The variability between the different assay techniques was less than the inherent variability of repeated breath hydrogen assays using the same technique.

40|$|The {{surfactant}} Continuous Powder Aerosolization (CPA) {{technology is}} intended for continuous administration of an aerosol for inhalation by preterm neonates on non-invasive ventilatory support. The CPA allows efficient aerosolization of dry surfactant powder, generating an aerosol of high concentration.

The wet surfactant aerosol is then conducted via a tube to the patient interface (e. g., <b>nasal</b> <b>prongs).</b> Performance testing of nebulizers currently follows DIN EN 13544 - 1. Since this norm applies to nebulizers designed for adults, a new test strategy for the special requirements of a device for neonates had to be implemented.

Importantly, however, these techniques are subject to measurement and performance error and we took great care to standardize the technical conditions for these measurements The lack of effect of diaphragmatic work might probably be explained by the relatively normalized (approximately 30 %) TFdi in these patients at baseline [31, 32] had been stabilized before protocol implementation. Despite having other clinical and biochemical indicators for ventilatory support, our subjects had improved and been stabilized prior to protocol initiation (all subjects weaned to <b>nasal</b> <b>prong</b> oxygen), making it difficult to demonstrate a difference in diaphragmatic work of breathing. This is in contrast to a report of 14 stable chronically hypercapnic COPD patients in which both HFNT and NIV significantly reduced PTPdi (diaphragmatic work) [8]. Furthermore, in a more recent study including 5 hypercapnic patients recovering from acute respiratory failure, esophageal pressure swings, PTP and work of breathing (markers of respiratory effort) were significantly reduced with HFNT at 60  L/min [33]. This difference, however, may also stem from inherent differences in the structure and function of the diaphragm between COPD and CF patients [34].|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nasal CPAP {{is widely}} used in {{neonatal}} ICUs. Aerosolized medications such as inhaled steroids and agonists are commonly administered in-line through nasal CPAP, especially to infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We hypothesized that aerosol delivery to the lungs via variable-flow nasal CPAP in an in vitro model would be unreliable, and that the delivery {{would depend on the}} position of the aerosol generator within the nasal CPAP circuit. METHODS: We used a system that employed a test lung placed in a plastic jar and subjected to negative pressure. Simulated inspiration effort was measured with a heated-wire anemometer. We used technetium- 99 m-labeled diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid as our aerosol. The nebulizer was placed either close to the humidifier or close to the <b>nasal</b> <b>prongs</b> in the circuit, and patient effort was simulated with a minute ventilation of 0. 4 L/min. RESULTS: Relative aerosol delivery to the infant test lung with the nebulizer close to the humidifier was extremely low (0. 3 0. 4 %), whereas placing the nebulizer close to the <b>nasal</b> <b>prongs</b> resulted in significantly (P<. 001) improved delivery (21 11 %). Major areas of aerosol deposition with the nebulizer close to the humidifier versus close to the <b>nasal</b> <b>prongs</b> were: nebulizer (10 4 % vs 33 13 %, P <. 001), exhalation limb (9 17 % vs 26 30 %, P. 23), and generator tubing (21 11 % vs 19 20 %, P. 86). Placing the nebulizer close to the humidifier resulted in 59 8 % of the aerosol being deposited in the inhalation tubing along the heater wire. CONCLUSIONS: Isotope delivery from an aerosol generator placed near the humid-ifier on variable-flow nasal CPAP was negligible in this in vitro setup; however, such delivery was significantly improved by locating the aerosol generator closer to the nasal CPAP interface.

30|$|Preoxygenation is {{intended}} to reduce desaturation and hypoxaemia in the drug-induced apnoeic phase of RSI. Application of 100  % oxygen via <b>nasal</b> <b>prongs</b> promotes movement of oxygen-enriched air into the alveoli during apnoea, which can help sustain SaO 2. The majority of studies, though of variable methodology suggest a benefit with apnoeic oxygenation with improvement in SaO 2 during the apnoeic phase or difficult laryngoscopy. One RCT comparing apnoeic oxygenation to standard facemask oxygen prior to laryngoscopy failed to show any benefit of apnoeic oxygenation.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Apnoeic {{oxygenation}} during laryngoscopy {{has been}} emphasised in recent recommendations for airway management. We aimed {{to compare the}} effect of nasal oxygen supplementation on time for pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO 2) to fall from 100 % to 92 % (desaturation safety time), to assess the arterial oxygen partial pressures (PaO 2) with and without nasal oxygen supplementation and the time for SpO 2 to recover from 92 % to 100 % after initiation of ventilation. Methods: This is a prospective randomised placebo-controlled trial involving sixty patients, where nasal oxygen supplementation given at 10 L/min during apnoea of laryngoscopy in one group of patients (Group O 2) was compared to no oxygen supplementation in other group (Group NoO 2). Desaturation safety period and the PaO 2 just after intubation were compared. Time for SpO 2 to increase to 100 % after initiation of ventilation was also assessed. Demographic details were compared using the Chi-square and t-tests. Student's t-test for independent variables {{was used to compare}} means of data obtained. Results: Desaturation safety period at 415. 46 ± 97. 23 seconds in group O 2 versus 378. 69 ± 89. 31 seconds in group NoO 2 (P = 0. 213) and PaO 2 (P = 0. 952) and time to recovery of SpO 2 (P = 0. 058) were similar in both groups. Rise in arterial carbon dioxide secondary to apnoea was slower in oxygen supplementation group (P = 0. 032). Conclusion: Apnoeic oxygen supplementation at 10 L/min flow by <b>nasal</b> <b>prong</b> did not significantly prolong the apnoea desaturation safety periods or the PaO 2 in our study...|$|R
40|$|Gastric {{emptying}} (GE) {{is difficult}} to evaluate properly in preterm infants {{because of the lack}} of safe and reliable noninvasive methods. The 13 C-octanoic acid breath test, a noninvasive method to assess GE, was validated in adults. The aim of this study was to adapt the methodology of the 13 C-octanoic acid breath test regarding test meal and sampling methods and to define normal values for healthy preterm infants. We tested 11 clinically stable preterm infants who demonstrated normal fetal growth. The infants mean gestational age at birth was 33 weeks, mean birth weight was 1754 g, mean postnatal age at the day of study was 26 days, and mean weight was 2296 g. After a fasting period of 3 h, the subject was fed a test meal with low and stable 13 C background activity mixed with 50 microliters of 13 C-labeled octanoic acid and 1 g polyethylene glycol 3350. Breath samples were collected using a <b>nasal</b> <b>prong</b> in basal conditions and after the test meal. CO 2 production according to weight and age was used in the calculations for 13 CO 2 enrichment of exhaled air. Results were expressed as percentage of 13 C dose excretion per hour and percentage of cumulative 13 C after 4 h. gastric emptying coefficient (GEC), and gastric half-emptying time (t 1 / 2 b). The values for percent of cumulative 13 C after 4 h ranged from 30. 7 to 52. 6 % (mean, 40. 2 %), GEC ranged from 2. 7 to 3. 4 (mean, 3. 0), and the values for t 1 / 2 b ranged from 17 to 100 min (mean, 57 min). We conclude that the 13 C-octanoic acid breath test can be adapted to preterm infants to allow the study of GE in various conditions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: A {{previous}} {{study showed that}} bee venom (BV) could cause anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions. Although hypersensitivity reactions due to sweet bee venom (SBV) have been reported, SBV {{has been reported to}} be associated with significantly reduced sensitization compared to BV. Although no systemic immediate hypersensitive response accompanied by abnormal vital signs has been reported with respect to SBV, we report a systemic immediate hypersensitive response that we experienced while trying to use SBV clinically. Methods: The patient had undergone BV treatment several times at other Oriental medicine clinics and had experienced no adverse reactions. She came to acupuncture & moxibustion department at Semyung university hospital of Oriental medicine (Je-cheon, Korea) complaining of facial hypoesthesia and was treated using SBV injections, her first SBV treatment. SBV, 0. 05 cc, was injected at each of 8 acupoints, for a total of 0. 40 cc: Jichang (ST 4), Daeyeong (ST 5), Hyeopgeo (ST 6), Hagwan (ST 7), Yepung (TE 17), Imun (TE 21), Cheonghoe (GB 2), and Gwallyeo (SI 18). Results: The patient showed systemic immediate hypersensitive reactions. The main symptoms were abdominal pain, nausea and perspiration, but common symptoms associated with hypersensitivity, such as edema, were mild. Abdominal pain was the most long-lasting symptom and was accompanied by nausea. Her body temperature decreased due to sweating. Her diastolic blood pressure could not be measured on three occasions. She remained alert, though the symptoms persisted. The following treatments were conducted in sequence; intramuscular epinephrine, 1 mg/mL, injection, intramuscular dexamethasone, 5 mg/mL, injection, intramuscular buscopan, 20 mg/mL, injection, oxygen (O 2) inhalation therapy, 1 L/minutes, via a <b>nasal</b> <b>prong,</b> and intravascular injection of normal saline, 1 L. After 12 hours of treatment, the symptoms had completely disappeared. Conclusion: This case shows that the use of SBV does not completely eliminate the possibility of hypersensitivity and that patients who received BV treatment before may also be sensitized to SBV. Thus, a skin test should be given prior to using SBV...|$|R
