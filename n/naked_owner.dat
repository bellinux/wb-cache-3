40|$|This comment {{focuses on}} the Louisiana Legislature’s recent {{deletion}} of a naked owner’s explicit right to alienate or encumber {{his or her own}} property. Part II of this comment provides the historical background of Louisiana Civil Code article 603, particularly the loss of the explicit right of the <b>naked</b> <b>owner</b> to alienate the property itself and the addition of the more tenuous right to alienate his naked ownership. Part III applies several different statutory interpretations to the article to determine how the revised article should be interpreted. Part IV explains the practical implications of the 2010 revision on Louisiana immovable property. Finally, Part V concludes by reiterating that despite the statutory comment that the 2010 revision did not change the law, the most recent alteration to the language affords the <b>naked</b> <b>owner</b> less rights...|$|E
5000|$|In Louisiana, Civil Code article 1493 {{dictates}} that [...] "Forced heirs are {{descendants of the}} first degree who, {{at the time of}} the death of the decedent, are twenty-three years of age or younger or descendants of the first degree of any age who, because of mental incapacity or physical infirmity, are permanently incapable of taking care of their persons or administering their estates {{at the time of the}} death of the decedent". If they are not disinherited (LCC art. 1494) they qualify as forced heirs. The disinherison must be made expressly and for one of eight just causes; otherwise, it is null (LCC art. 1621). The legitime is equal to 25% of the patrimony (if one forced heir); or 50% (if more than one); and each forced heir will receive the lesser of an equal proportion of the legitime or what they would have received through intestacy (LCC art. 1495, Succession of Greenlaw). If a person who would have otherwise qualified as a forced heir dies before the parent, rights to that share may pass to that person's children, although how that share is distributed among them if one or more is an interdict remains unsettled law. Forced heirs may demand collation, whereby certain gifts received by any successor in the three years before the death of the parent may be subtracted from their share. Louisiana does not have a forced heirship provision for spouses, however at death the spouse's interest in any community property is converted to his or her separate property; and a usufruct is granted over the remaining community (with the forced heirs as <b>naked</b> <b>owners</b> of their respective shares). That usufruct terminates at death or remarriage.|$|R
