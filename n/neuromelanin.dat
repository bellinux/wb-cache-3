5|$|Melanins are {{a family}} of dark-pigmented {{substances}} found {{in a wide range}} of organisms. Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as dopamine-melanin, that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme tyrosinase. The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses L-DOPA as a precursor but not dopamine. However, there is substantial evidence that the <b>neuromelanin</b> that gives a dark color to the brain's substantia nigra is at least in part dopamine-melanin.|$|E
25|$|The {{cell body}} of a neuron is {{supported}} by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments, which are assembled into larger neurofibrils. Some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as <b>neuromelanin</b> (a brownish-black pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines), and lipofuscin (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which accumulate with age. Other structural proteins that are important for neuronal function are actin and the tubulin of microtubules. Actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during neuronal development.|$|E
2500|$|Some nonerythroid cells (i.e., cells {{other than}} the red blood cell line) contain hemoglobin. In the brain, these include the A9 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, astrocytes in the {{cerebral}} cortex and hippocampus, and in all mature oligodendrocytes. It {{has been suggested that}} brain hemoglobin in these cells may enable the [...] "storage of oxygen to provide a homeostatic mechanism in anoxic conditions, which is especially important for A9 DA neurons that have an elevated metabolism with a high requirement for energy production". It has been noted further that [...] "A9 dopaminergic neurons may be at particular risk since in addition to their high mitochondrial activity they are under intense oxidative stress caused by the production of hydrogen peroxide via autoxidation and/or monoamine oxidase (MAO)-mediated deamination of dopamine and the subsequent reaction of accessible ferrous iron to generate highly toxic hydroxyl radicals". This may explain the risk of these cells for degeneration in Parkinson's disease. The hemoglobin-derived iron in these cells is not the cause of the post-mortem darkness of these cells (origin of the Latin name, substantia nigra), but rather is due to <b>neuromelanin.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Neuromelanins</b> (NMs) are {{neuronal}} pigments of melanic-lipidic type which accumulate during aging. They {{are involved}} in protective and degenerative mechanisms depending on the cellular context, however their structures are still poorly understood. NMs from nine human brain areas were analyzed in detail. Elemental analysis led to identification of three types of NM, while infrared spectroscopy showed that NMs from neurons of substantia nigra and locus coeruleus, which selectively degenerate in Parkinson’s disease, have similar structure but different from NMs from brain regions not targeted by the disease. Synthetic melanins containing Fe and bovine serum albumin were prepared to model the natural product and help clarifying the structure of NMs. Extensive nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies showed the presence of dolichols both in the soluble and insoluble parts of NM. Diffusion measurements demonstrated that the dimethyl sulfoxide soluble components consist of oligomeric precursors with MWs in the range 1. 4 – 52 kDa, while the insoluble part contains polymers of larger size but with a similar composition. These {{data suggest that the}} selective vulnerability of neurons of substantia nigra and locus coeruleus in Parkinson’s disease might depend on the structure of the pigment. Moreover, they allow to propose a pathway for NM biosynthesis in human brain...|$|R
30|$|<b>Neuromelanins</b> (NM) are {{a family}} of {{compounds}} occurring in all brain regions of human brain. These pigments are contained in special lysosomes together with lipid bodies, protein matrix, and accumulate in aging (Zucca et al. Neurotox Res 2014). The synthesis of NM is a protective process because the melanic component is generated through the removal of reactive/toxic quinones that would otherwise cause neurotoxicity (Sulzer et al. PNAS 2000). NM serves an additional protective role through its ability to chelate and accumulate metals, including environmentally toxic metals such as mercury and lead. Other metals like Fe, Zn, Al, Cr and Mo are also accumulated by NM (Zecca et al. PNAS 2008). However NM can play also a toxic role in Parkinson’s disease (PD), when it is released by dying neurons of substantia nigra. Extracellular NM particles induce microglial activation with production of superoxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, pro-inflammatory factors and causes neurodegeneration (Zhang et al. Neurotox Res 2011). A high content of major histocompatibility class I complex (MHC-I) was found in NM-containing organelles of the neurons in substantia nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC) which degenerate in PD, while other neurons not targeted by PD has low MHC-I. The latter can bind antigens derived from foreign proteins, presenting them on neuronal membrane. Then CD 8 + cytotoxic T-cells, which were observed in proximity of MHC-I presenting neurons of SN and LC in PD subjects, can target these neurons inducing neuronal death. Infiltration of T-cells occurs in SN and LC of PD subjects. The presence of MHC-I in catecholamine neurons containing NM could explain their selective vulnerability in PD, revealing a novel inflammatory T-cell mediated neurodegenerative process of PD (Cebrián et al. Nat Commun 2014). In conclusion NM can play a protective or toxic role depending on the molecular/cellular context.|$|R

50|$|<b>Neuromelanin</b> (NM) {{is a dark}} pigment {{found in}} the brain which is {{structurally}} related to melanin.

5000|$|In Parkinson's disease, a {{disorder}} that affects neuromotor functioning, there is decreased <b>neuromelanin</b> in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus as consequence of specific {{dropping out of}} dopaminergic and noradrenergic pigmented neurons.

While no correlation between race {{and the level of}} <b>neuromelanin</b> in the substantia nigra has been reported, the significantly lower incidence of Parkinson's in blacks than in whites has [...] "prompted some to suggest that cutaneous melanin might somehow serve to protect the <b>neuromelanin</b> in substantia nigra from external toxins."

50|$|<b>Neuromelanin</b> is {{directly}} biosynthesized from L-DOPA, precursor to dopamine, by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic acid decarboxylase (AADC). Alternatively, synaptic vesicles and endosomes accumulate cytosolic dopamine (via vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) and transport it to mitochondria {{where it is}} metabolized by monoamine oxidase. Excess dopamine and DOPA molecules are oxidized by iron catalysis into dopaquinones and semiquinones which are then phagocytosed and are stored as <b>neuromelanin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Neuromelanin</b> gives {{specific}} brain sections, {{such as the}} {{substantia nigra}} or the locus coeruleus, distinct color. It {{is a type of}} melanin and similar to other forms of peripheral melanin. It is insoluble in organic compounds, and can be labeled by silver stains. It is called <b>neuromelanin</b> because of its function and the color change that appears in tissues containing it. It contains black/brown pigmented granules. <b>Neuromelanin</b> is found to accumulate during ageing and is found during the first 2-3 years of life. It is believed to protect neurons in the substantia nigra from iron-induced oxidative stress. It is considered a true melanin due to its stable free radical structure and it avidly chelates metals.|$|E
50|$|Dark {{pigments}} in the {{substantia nigra}} were first described in 1838 by Purkyně, and the term <b>neuromelanin</b> was proposed in 1957 by Lillie, {{though it has}} been thought to serve no function until recently.

It has been linked to Parkinson's disease and because of this possible connection, <b>neuromelanin</b> has been heavily researched in the last decade.|$|E
5000|$|The locus caoeruleus (or [...] "LC") {{is located}} in the {{posterior}} area of the rostral pons in the lateral floor of the fourth ventricle. It is composed of mostly medium-size neurons. Melanin granules inside the neurons of the LC contribute to its blue colour. Thus, it is also known as the nucleus pigmentosus pontis, meaning [...] "heavily pigmented nucleus of the pons." [...] The <b>neuromelanin</b> is formed by the polymerization of noradrenaline and is analogous to the black dopamine-based <b>neuromelanin</b> in the substantia nigra.|$|E
50|$|The MIF {{homologue}} D-dopachrome tautomerase (EC 4.1.1.84) {{is involved}} in detoxification through the conversion of dopaminechrome (and possibly norepinephrinechrome), the toxic quinine product of the neurotransmitter dopamine (and norepinephrine), to an indole derivative that {{can serve as a}} precursor to <b>neuromelanin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Degeneration of {{pigmented}} neurons in {{this region}} is the principal pathology that underlies Parkinson's disease and this depigmentation can be visualized in vivo with <b>Neuromelanin</b> MRI. In a few people, the cause of Parkinson's disease is genetic, but in most cases, {{the reason for the}} death of these dopamine neurons is unknown (idiopathic). Parkinsonism can also be produced by viral infections such as encephalitis or a number of toxins, such as MPTP, an industrial toxin which can be mistakenly produced during synthesis of the meperidine analog MPPP. Many such toxins appear to work by producing reactive oxygen species. Binding to <b>neuromelanin</b> by means of charge transfer complexes may concentrate radical-generating toxins in the substantia nigra.|$|E
50|$|This method {{exploits}} the paramagnetic {{properties of}} <b>neuromelanin</b> {{and can be}} used to visualize the substantia nigra and the locus coeruleus.

However, the biological function remains unknown, although human NM {{has been shown to}} efficiently bind transition metals such as iron, as well as other potentially toxic molecules. Therefore, it may play crucial roles in apoptosis and the related Parkinson's disease.|$|E
50|$|RTT pathology, in some aspects, {{overlaps}} {{the motor}} phenotype observed in PD patients. Several neuropathological studies on postmortem brain samples argued for an SNpc alteration evidenced by <b>neuromelanin</b> hypopigmentation, {{reduction in the}} structure area, and even controversial, signs of apoptosis. In parallel, an hypometabolism was underlined by a reduction of several catecholamines (dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline) and their principal metabolic by-products. Mouse models of RTT are available and the most studied are constitutively deleted Mecp2 mice developed by Adrian Bird or Rudolf Jaenisch laboratories.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that melanin may serve a protective role other than photoprotection. Melanin is able to effectively ligate metal ions through its carboxylate and phenolic hydroxyl groups, in many cases much more efficiently than the powerful chelating ligand ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). Thus, it may serve to sequester potentially toxic metal ions, protecting {{the rest of the}} cell. This hypothesis is supported {{by the fact that the}} loss of <b>neuromelanin</b> observed in Parkinson's disease is accompanied by an increase in iron levels in the brain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{substantia nigra}} is a basal ganglia {{structure}} {{located in the}} midbrain that {{plays an important role}} in reward and movement. Substantia nigra is Latin for [...] "black substance", reflecting the fact that parts of the substantia nigra appear darker than neighboring areas due to high levels of <b>neuromelanin</b> in dopaminergic neurons. It was discovered in 1784 by Félix Vicq-d'Azyr, and Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring alluded to this structure in 1791. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta.|$|E

The ‘’black substance’’ that the term translates as, refers to the <b>neuromelanin</b> found in the dopaminergic neurons. These are found in a darker region of the structure the pars compacta. There is a lighter coloured region called the pars reticulata. There are similar cells in the substantia nigra and the globus pallidum. Both parts receive input from the striatopallidal fibers.|$|E
5000|$|The 'English' name {{locus coeruleus}} [...] is {{actually}} a Latin expression consisting of the noun, locus, place or spot and the adjective coeruleus, dark blue or sky-blue. This was aptly translated into English as blue place in 1907 in the English translation of the official Latin anatomic nomenclature of 1895, Nomina Anatomica. The name of the locus coeruleus is derived from its azure appearance in unstained brain tissue. The color is due to light scattering from <b>neuromelanin</b> in noradrenergic (producing or activated by norepinephrine) nerve cell bodies. The phenomenon is magnified by the Falck-Hillarp technique°, which combines freeze-dried tissue and formaldehyde to fluoresce the catecholamines and serotonin contained in the tissue.|$|E
50|$|Sulzer and his lab {{also studied}} nerve impulses in Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, schizophrenia, drug addiction, and autism. They helped to {{establish}} the role of autophagy by lysosomes in neuronal disease. They showed the role of <b>neuromelanin,</b> the pigment of the substantia nigra, in methamphetamine neurotoxicity, and Huntington's disease. With Ana Maria Cuervo of Albert Einstein College of Medicine they showed that a cause of Parkinson's disease {{could be due to}} an interference with a chaperone-mediated autophagy caused by the protein alpha-synuclein. His work indicates that a lack of normal pruning of synapses could underlie the development of autism, and that in turn may also my due to inhibited neuronal autophagy in patients, due to overactivation of the mTOR pathway during childhood and adolescence.|$|E

He also experimented with nutmeg that same year, when he [...] "washed down three ground nutmegs with a glass of wine and experienced headaches, nausea, euphoria, and hallucinations that lasted several days", which remain a good description of today's average nutmeg binge. Purkyně discovered sweat glands in 1833 and published a thesis that recognised 9 principal configuration groups of fingerprints in 1823. Purkyně was also the first to describe and illustrate in 1838 the intracytoplasmic pigment <b>neuromelanin</b> in the substantia nigra.|$|E
5000|$|The locus ceruleus is {{affected}} {{in many forms}} of neurodegenerative diseases: genetic and idiopathic Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick's disease or Alzheimer's disease. It is also affected in Down syndrome. For example, there is up to 80% loss of locus ceruleus neurons in Alzheimer's disease. Mouse models of Alzheimer's disease show accelerated progression after chemical destruction of the locus ceruleus [...] The norepinephrine from locus ceruleus cells {{in addition to its}} neurotransmitter role locally diffuses from [...] "varicosities". As such it provides an endogenous anti-inflammatory agent in the microenvironment around the neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels in the neocortex and hippocampus. It has been shown that norepinephrine stimulates mouse microglia to suppress Aβ-induced production of cytokines and their phagocytosis of Aβ. This suggests that degeneration of the locus ceruleus might be responsible for increased Aβ deposition in AD brains. Degeneration of pigmented neurons in this region in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease can be visualized in vivo with <b>Neuromelanin</b> MRI.|$|E
5000|$|In humans, {{the nerve}} cell {{bodies of the}} pars compacta are {{coloured}} black by the pigment <b>neuromelanin.</b> The degree of pigmentation increases with age. This pigmentation is visible as a distinctive black stripe in brain sections and is {{the origin of the}} name given to this volume of the brain. The neurons have particularly long and thick dendrites (François et al.). The ventral dendrites, particularly, go down deeply in the pars reticulata. Other similar neurons are more sparsely distributed in the midbrain and constitute [...] "groups" [...] with no well-defined borders, although continuous to the pars compacta, in a prerubral position. These have been given, in early works in rats (with not much respect for the anatomical subdivisions), the name of [...] "area A8" [...] and [...] "A10". The pars compacta itself ("A9") is usually subdivided into a ventral and a dorsal tier, the last being calbindin positive. The ventral tier is considered as A9v. The dorsal tier A9d is linked to an ensemble comprising also A8 and A10, A8, A9d and A10 representing 28% of dopaminergic neurons. The neurons of the pars compacta receive inhibiting signals from the collateral axons from the neurons of the pars reticulata.|$|E

40|$|The {{pigmented}} neurones of the {{substantia nigra}} are typically lost in Parkinson's disease; however, the possible relation between neuronal vulnerability {{and the presence}} of <b>neuromelanin</b> has not been elucidated. Early histological studies revealed the presence of increasing amounts of <b>neuromelanin</b> in the substantia nigra with aging in higher mammals, showed that the <b>neuromelanin</b> granules are surrounded by a membrane, and comparatively evaluated the pigmentation of the substantia nigra in different animal species.

40|$|AbstractNeuromelanin is an {{amorphous}} pigment of the catecholamine origin that accumulates {{in certain}} dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra of human brain. In Parkinson's disease, {{there appears to}} be selective degeneration of the most heavily pigmented neurons of the substantia nigra, and this process has been linked to the presence of <b>neuromelanin.</b> It has been postulated that <b>neuromelanin</b> could increase the risk of oxidative stress reactions. On the other hand, melanin is usually considered to be an efficient antioxidant. Here we analyze experimental conditions that stimulate, or inhibit, antioxidant properties of <b>neuromelanin.</b> Using electron spin resonance (ESR) - spin trapping technique and salicylate hydroxylation assay, we monitored the formation of free hydroxyl radicals generated by a Fenton system in the presence of varying concentration of dopamine-melanin, a synthetic model for <b>neuromelanin.</b> Our data clearly indicate that the antioxidant action of <b>neuromelanin</b> is predominantly due to its ability to sequester redox-active metal ions such as iron.

We have demonstrated that dopamine-melanin saturated with ferric ions, could enhance the formation of free hydroxyl radicals by redox activation of the ions. Thus, under the conditions that stimulate the release of accumulated metal ions, <b>neuromelanin</b> may actually become an efficient prooxidant.
