5|$|Peter {{suddenly}} {{wakes up}} to find himself in the machine in 2011, only one minute since he entered it, and Olivia waiting by his side; concurrently, in the parallel universe, Walternate attempts to convince Fauxlivia to help stop the machine. Peter recalls the memories from the future, and uses the machine to merge the machine rooms from both universes into one thus creating a bridge. While Olivia and Walter and their doppelgangers stare each other down, Peter convinces the two sides {{to work together to}} try to repair the damage to save both universes, then suddenly disappears. The Olivias and Walters cautiously agree that they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> aside their differences to save both worlds, apparently unaware of Peter's disappearance. Outside on Liberty Island in the prime universe, the Observers watch as September (Michael Cerveris) notes to December (Eugene Lipinski) that Peter has already been forgotten by his friends, his purpose having been served, and explains that Peter now never existed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> {{together}} relativity and {{quantum mechanics}} {{was one of}} the major motivations in the development of quantum field theory. Pascual Jordan and Wolfgang Pauli showed in 1928 that quantum fields could be made to be relativistic, and Paul Dirac produced the Dirac equation for electrons, and in so doing predicted the existence of antimatter.|$|E
25|$|In constant-flow {{regulators}} {{the first}} stage is a pressure regulator providing a constant reduced pressure, and the second stage is a plain on/off valve. These are the earliest type of breathing set flow control. The diver must open and close the supply valve to regulate flow. Constant flow valves in an open circuit breathing set consume gas less economically than demand valve regulators because gas flows {{even when it is}} not needed. Before 1939, diving and industrial open circuit breathing sets with constant-flow regulators were designed by Le Prieur, but did not get into general use due to very short dive duration. Design complications resulted from the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the second-stage flow control valve where it could be easily operated by the diver.|$|E

Saturday explores the feeling of fulfilment in Perowne: he is respected and respectable but not quite at ease, wondering about the luck that has him where he is and others homeless or in menial jobs. The family is materially well-off, with a plush home and a Mercedes, but justifiably so—Perowne and his wife work hard. McEwan tells of his success rate and keeping cool under pressure; there is a trade off, {{as he and his}} wife work long hours and <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> their diaries side by side to find time to spend together.|$|E
500|$|After the incident, a {{spokesperson}} for Russian president Vladimir Putin called it a [...] "terrible tragedy", blaming it on a failing of [...] "supervisory bodies": [...] "What happened in Irkutsk was a tremendous tragedy. Words fail me. Certainly this was an outrage because the inspectors and other agencies were supposed to prevent it, and didn't do so." [...] Dmitry Medvedev, the prime minister, called for a ban on non-traditional alcoholic liquids like the bath lotion, stating that [...] "it's an outrage, and we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an end to this". Days later, the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Putin planned to lower taxes on alcohol {{in an effort to}} curb the use of unsafe alcohol substitutes, requiring officials to present a plan by 31 March 2017.|$|E

500|$|Opus Dei {{was founded}} by a Catholic priest, Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, on 2 October 1928 in Madrid, Spain. According to Escrivá, on that day he {{experienced}} a vision in which he [...] "saw Opus Dei". He gave the organization the name [...] "Opus Dei", which in Latin means [...] "Work of God", in order to underscore {{the belief that the}} organization was not his (Escrivá's) work, but was rather God's work. Throughout his life, Escrivá held that the founding of Opus Dei had a supernatural character. Escrivá summarized Opus Dei's mission as a way of helping ordinary Christians [...] "to understand that their life... is a way of holiness and evangelization... And to those who grasp this ideal of holiness, the Work offers the spiritual assistance and training they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it into practice." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite these achievements, Jack grew {{weary of}} making films, and he sold a {{substantial}} amount of his studio stock to Seven Arts Productions on November 14, 1966. [...] Some observers believed that Ben Kalmenson, Warner Bros.'s executive vice president, persuaded Warner to sell his stock so that Kalmenson could assume leadership of the studio. [...] Warner, however, had personal reasons for seeking retirement. [...] His wife, Ann, continually pressured him to [...] "slow down", and the aging studio head felt a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his affairs in order. [...] Warner sold his 1.6million shares of studio stock shortly after producing the film adaptation of Lerner & Loewe's Camelot. [...] The sale yielded, after capital gains taxes, about $24million (equivalent to $ million today). [...] Eight months after the sale, Warner quipped, [...] "Who would ever have thought that a butcher boy from Youngstown, Ohio, would end up with twenty-four million smackers in his pocket?" [...] At the time of the sale, Warner had earned the distinction of being the second chief to also serve as company president, after Columbia Pictures' Harry Cohn.|$|E
500|$|Stanton noted many {{commentators}} placed {{emphasis on}} the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because [...] "that disconnection {{is going to be}} the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet". Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> effort into relationships. Christian journalist Rod Dreher saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the Axiom has separated them from nature, making them [...] "slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. [...] "WALL-E is not a Luddite film," [...] he said. [...] "It doesn't demonize technology. It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature—that it must be subordinate to human flourishing, and help move that along." ...|$|E

500|$|When the Model 1897 {{was first}} introduced, the price {{depended}} upon what grade was being purchased and what features were {{being added to}} that specific shotgun. To purchase a plain finished shotgun would cost the buyer $25, whereas an engraved receiver with checkered and finer wood included cost $100. The more expensive grades of the Model 1897 were the standard, trap, pigeon, and tournament grades. These were the grades that were normally equipped with an engraved receiver and with checkered, finer wood. [...] The less expensive and plainer grades were the Brush, Brush Takedown, Riot, and Trench. These grades were not given the higher valued wood or special designs. This is because these guns were designed and built for hard abuse. These grades stood a higher chance of being badly damaged {{so there was no}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> extra money into them for appearance purposes. As the functions that were performed with these grades required them to be lightweight, it was not beneficial to use heavy and expensive wood when designing them. Most often, when these grades were purchased, they were purchased in high numbers. By designing these grades with standard wood and finish, it kept the prices at a lower level.|$|E

Drew Grant of Salon.com said that despite the product placement, the video [...] "s visually stunning, with a 'Matrix' meets 'The Cell' vibe that will have Lady Gaga wishing she had thought of IV paint drips first." [...] Alex Catarinella of The Huffington Post deemed it as her greatest and most mature work, and said the video was ultimately simple in its concept, and added, [...] "The once picture-perfect pop star has returned and is offering fans the new, worn-and-torn and yes, stronger than yesterday Britney." [...] The use of product placement received criticism from the media. Megan Gibson of Time said that the video was [...] "borderline insulting" [...] and commented, [...] "we get that it's hard economic times all around, but couldn't they have been a tad more subtle with ?". Liz Kelly of The Washington Post called the clip [...] "an infomercial" [...] and said, [...] "I would write more, but suddenly feel the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on some Make Up Forever and dash out to buy a Sony flat screen TV."
