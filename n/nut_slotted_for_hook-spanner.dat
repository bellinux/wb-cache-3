In this design, made popular by the Fender company, the strings sit on roller {{bearings}} instead of <b>nut</b> <b>slots.</b> The rollers let the string freely slide or roll through the nut. The roller nut {{helps keep the}} guitar in tune by preventing the strings from getting stuck in the nut.|$|R

50|$|A {{conventional}} nut made {{of relatively}} soft plastic or bone will easily clamp the string and make fine tuning difficult. The clamping effect does not only result from too narrow <b>nut</b> <b>slots,</b> but notably {{more from the}} impression of the string windings into the nut material {{at the bottom of}} the slot. That effect is more prevalent with wire wound nylon strings than with steel strings. Using a zero fret relieves the pressure from the nut material and the nut serves only to center the strings sideways. Tuning is smooth and without sudden movement and intonation jumps. There are only a few manufacturers making metal (bronze)conventional nuts which avoid the string clamping effect.|$|R
