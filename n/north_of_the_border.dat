5|$|In 1603 James VI of Scotland {{inherited}} {{the crown of}} England, bringing a period of peace between the two countries. The royal court left for London, {{and as a result}} – with the exceptions of occasional visits – building work on royal castles <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> largely ceased. Some castles continued to have modest military utility into the eighteenth century. The royal castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton and Stirling, along with Dunstaffnage, Dunollie, Blackness and Ruthven Castle, continued in use as practical fortifications. Tower houses were being built up until the 1640s. After the Restoration the fortified tower house fell out of fashion, but the weak state of the Scottish economy was such that, while many larger properties were simply abandoned, the more modest castles continued to be used and adapted as houses, rather than rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|The 15th and 16th centuries saw a {{small number}} of British castles develop into still grander structures, often drawing on the Renaissance views on {{architecture}} that were increasing in popularity on the continent. Tower keeps, large solid keeps used for private accommodation, probably inspired by those in France had started to appear in the 14th century at Dudley and Warkworth. In the 15th century the fashion spread with the creation of very expensive, French-influenced palatial castles featuring complex tower keeps at Wardour, Tattershall and Raglan Castle. In central and eastern England castles began to be built in brick, with Caister, Kirby Muxloe and Tattershall forming examples of this new style. <b>North</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> the construction of Holyrood Great Tower between 1528 and 1532 picked up on this English tradition, but incorporated additional French influences to produce a highly secure but comfortable castle, guarded by a gun park.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{begins at}} the Calexico East Border Station, which is open from 6 am to 10 pm, seven days a week. Just <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> the highway splits into two roads {{to pass through the}} customs checkpoints before the two roads merge back together; the fork to the west is for cars, and the fork to the east is for {{commercial}} vehicles. SR 7 takes the western fork, which passes over the other fork at the northern end and merges into that highway. From here to I-8, SR 7 is an expressway known as Orchard Road. Before reaching I-8, SR 7 travels north and has an at-grade intersection with SR 98 and a few other roads. At its northern end, SR 7 turns into County Route S32 (still Orchard Road) as it intersects with I-8. The entire route runs through the Sonoran Desert and is built to expressway standards.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 12th and early 13th centuries {{the border and}} {{political}} relationship between England and Scotland was disputed, with the kings of Scotland claiming parts {{of what is now}} northern England. John's father, Henry II, had forced William the Lion to swear fealty to him at the Treaty of Falaise in 1174. This had been rescinded by Richard I in exchange for financial compensation in 1189, but the relationship remained uneasy. John began his reign by reasserting his sovereignty over the disputed northern counties. He refused William's request for the earldom of Northumbria, but did not intervene in Scotland itself and focused on his continental problems. The two kings maintained a friendly relationship, meeting in 1206 and 1207, until it was rumoured in 1209 that William was intending to ally himself with Philip II of France. John invaded Scotland and forced William to sign the Treaty of Norham, which gave John control of William's daughters and required a payment of £10,000. This effectively crippled William's power <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border,</b> and by 1212 John had to intervene militarily to support the Scottish king against his internal rivals. John made no efforts to reinvigorate the Treaty of Falaise, though, and both William and Alexander in turn remained independent kings, supported by, but not owing fealty to, John.|$|E
5|$|NY383 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY36 in the hamlet of Mumford, located just <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> between Monroe and Livingston Counties {{in the town}} of Wheatland. Taking on the name Scottsville–Mumford Road, NY383 follows Oatka Creek east through open fields and passes through the small hamlet of Garbutt {{on its way to the}} village of Scottsville, where it becomes Caledonia Avenue. At an intersection with the southern terminus of NY386, NY383 turns east onto Main Street and follows it through the residential southern portion of the village and past the Scottsville Free Library. Main Street comes to an end at a junction with River Road (NY251, which has its western terminus here) and Rochester Street near the northern bank of Oatka Creek. Here, NY383 curves north onto Rochester Street and proceeds through eastern Scottsville. The street name of NY383 becomes Scottsville Road upon intersecting the western terminus of NY253. Past this junction, the surroundings shift from village streets to housing tracts as the route exits Scottsville. North of the village, NY383 re-enters open fields once again upon crossing the Wheatland–Chili town line.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} commercial enterprise {{in the early}} part of the territorial era was the lucrative fur trade. At the beginning of the 19th century two British companies competed for dominance in the North American trade: Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. The North West company had used Grand Portage as its western headquarters along with other smaller companies that operated in the area. Grand Portage was one of the four principal British trading and shipping points furs in North America. Following the Treaty of Paris, in 1783, British operations at Grand Portage were technically illegal though the trade continued. However, beginning in 1801 the North West Company began re-establishing its headquarters <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> at the newly constructed Fort William in what is now Ontario. After 1804 Grand Portage had been reduced to a minor trading center and most traders eventually abandoned the area. In 1842, the Hudson Bay Company, which had by then absorbed the North West Company, shipped out a final band of Ojibwe who were employed by the company.|$|E
5|$|They {{defeated}} the Welsh team from Oswestry {{in the third}} round, 7–1. They were drawn at home against Aston Villa in the fourth round, but the match was called into doubt when it was scheduled to {{take place on the}} same date and location as Queen's Park's match against Hibernian F.C. in the Scottish Cup. But Queen's and their Scottish opponents agreed to postpone the match for two weeks. There {{was a great deal of}} interest by the spectators from Birmingham, and three special trains were laid on to transport them to Glasgow for the game with more than 1200 of them travelling <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border.</b> Around 10,000 fans filled the ground where they watched Queen's Park defeat Aston Villa 6–1. The fifth round was their lowest scoring game of the campaign, where they won away to Old Westminsters 1–0 at the Kennington Oval in London. In the semi-final they defeated Blackburn Olympic 4–1 to set up a final against the other Blackburn-based team; the match was played at a neutral venue in Nottingham. Olympic subsequently complained to The Football Association as the crowd invaded the pitch to cause disruption for their team; the complaint was not upheld.|$|E
5|$|Trevor is Canadian, born just <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>border</b> of the United States. He {{grew up with}} a {{physically}} abusive father and an emotionally abusive mother. Trevor had a brother, Ryan, who died prior to the game's events. Trevor's father abandoned him in a shopping mall, which he later burned down in retaliation. His father died when Trevor was 10. This upbringing combined with Trevor's violent temper led Trevor to be severely unhinged, leading to numerous fights at school, including an assault on a teacher. Trevor loved planes, and at some point entered the military as a pilot, but was quickly forced to leave after being reproved in a psychological evaluation. Later on, Trevor committed crimes, the first one being a small robbery that landed him in jail for six months (however, due to good behavior, he was out in four). He would continue his criminal ways, including using his piloting skills to become a smuggler. Trevor eventually met Michael Townley and both men realised that they wanted to earn money by performing large heists, and both men became successful in doing so. However, their partnership began to strain after Michael married a stripper named Amanda and started a family with her.|$|E
