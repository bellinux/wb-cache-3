2500|$|Tupperware is {{airtight}} {{plastic containers}} {{used for the}} preparation, storage, containment, and serving of perishable food {{in the kitchen and}} home. Tupperware was invented in 1946 by American chemist Earl Silas Tupper who devised a method of purifying black polyethylene slag, a waste product produced in oil refinement, into a molded substance that was flexible, tough, non-porous, <b>non-greasy</b> and translucent. Available in many colors, the plastic containers with [...] "burp seal" [...] did not become a commercial success until Brownie Wise, a Florida housewife, began throwing Tupperware parties in 1951 in order to demonstrate the product and explain the features.|$|E
2500|$|The loss of {{friction}} between wheels and rail results in loss of tractive force — the wheels begin to spin, {{and in some}} instances the train is unable to move. In braking, substantial loss {{of friction}} results in reduced braking force. Braking distances are considerably longer, and in extreme cases the wheels may even lock up, causing the train to slide. Modern locomotives and multiple units are equipped with Wheel slide protection to counter slippery rail conditions. [...] Locked wheels can self-grind flat spots on the steel tyres, especially if the wheels are still sliding when arriving at a <b>non-greasy</b> section of rail, e.g. one that has previously been sanded. [...] This causes the wheels to go out of profile (known colloquially as 'wheel flats'), which subsequently leads to severe vibration and the need for the wheels to be re-profiled or re-tyred at great expense.|$|E
50|$|Moisturizers {{can be used}} {{to prevent}} the skin from {{becoming}} too dry or oily, such as with light, <b>non-greasy</b> water-based moisturizers. Such moisturizers often contain lightweight oils, such as cetyl alcohol, or silicone-derived ingredients, such as cyclomethicone.|$|E
5000|$|Firstly, {{the site}} of damage must be identified. If the site is already not visible, a mixture of soap and water can be sprayed {{onto the surface of}} an {{inflated}} boat; bubbles will appear where there is a puncture. Mark {{the site of}} puncture with a <b>non-greasy</b> marker.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, modern hair gel {{was invented}} in the United States, by what would later be renamed the Dep Corporation. Marketed under the brand name Dep, modern hair gel was given this name by its inventor, Luis Montoya, in {{recognition}} of the substance that gave it its unique, <b>non-greasy</b> consistency: diethyl phthalate, commonly abbreviated as DEP.|$|E
5000|$|In 1947 after 26 {{months of}} {{development}} by Max Factor, Jr., the company released [...] "Pan-Stik", a cream make-up supplied in stick form {{and designed to}} take advantage of the latest changes in studio lighting and film stock. This product was quick to apply as well as <b>non-greasy.</b> It was released to the public in 1948 and was immediately commercially successful.|$|E
50|$|In pharmacy, a thermophobic foam {{consisting}} of 0.1% betamethasone valerate {{was found to}} be at least as effective as conventional remedies for treating dandruff. In addition, the foam is <b>non-greasy</b> and does not irritate the scalp. Another use of thermophobic material is in treating hyperhydrosis of the axilla and the palm: A thermophobic foam named Bettamousse developed by Mipharm, an Italian company, was found to treat hyperhydrosis effectively.|$|E
50|$|Kokum {{butter is}} <b>non-greasy</b> and gets {{absorbed into the}} skin once it is applied. It is often used as a {{substitute}} for cocoa butter due to its triglyceride composition. Kokum butter also contains antioxidants and vitamin E. Kokum butter exhibits excellent emollient properties and high oxidative stability, which can assist emulsion integrity. With its relatively higher melt point, it melts slightly at skin temperatures, making it ideal for lipsticks and balms. It is also added in the making of bar soaps and skin lotions. Kokum butter is also used to treat dry lips, chapped hands and soles of the feet.|$|E
5000|$|The {{application}} Protected Geographical Indicator of Origin (PGI) status {{describes the}} puddings as follows: [...] They are moist and firm in texture, with discernible, yet small, fat particulates. The Scottish oatmeal used in Stornoway Black Puddings {{is responsible for}} its good, rough texture. Stornoway Black Puddings may be cooked in, {{or out of the}} skin, they maintain their shape well throughout the cooking process. Once cooked, they appear almost black and break apart very easily when cut, yet do not significantly crumble. The meaty flavour is moist, rich, full, savoury, well seasoned—but not spicy—with a <b>non-greasy,</b> pleasant mouth and clean after taste feel.|$|E

50|$|Ensulizole (INN; {{also known}} as phenylbenzimidazole {{sulfonic}} acid) is a common sunscreen agent. In 1999, the United States Food and Drug Administration regulated that the name ensulizole be used on sunscreen labels in the United States. Ensulizole is primarily a UVB protecting agent providing only minimal UVA protection. The scope of UVB is 290 to 340 nanometers whereas the UVA range is 320 to 400 nanometers. For better UVA protection, it must be paired with avobenzone, titanium dioxide, or zinc oxide; outside of the United States {{it can also be}} paired with a UV absorber of the Tinosorb or Mexoryl types. Because ensulizole is water-soluble, it has the characteristic of feeling lighter on skin. As such, it is often used in sunscreen lotions or moisturizers whose aesthetic goal is a <b>non-greasy</b> finish. The free acid is poorly soluble in water, so it is only used as its soluble salts.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} changes in {{metabolites}} in the greasy tongue coating in patients with chronic gastritis. METHODS: Forty chronic gastritis patients presenting with greasy tongue coating, 30 chronic gastritis patients presenting with <b>non-greasy</b> tongue coating, and 20 healthy control persons presenting with light red tongues and thin white coating were enrolled, and the tongue coating was detected by combining artificial diagnosis and the Z-BOX Tongue Digital Analyzer’s diagnosis. Samples of all the tongue coatings were collected before treatment. The metabolic fingerprinting of the tongue coating samples was obtained using ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS), and the metabolic components in the tongue coating samples were detected. After this, principal component analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to identify potential metabolic markers. Finally, the components were identified using the Chemspider and HMDB searching. RESULTS: UPLC-MS results were analyzed by OPLS-DA and showed that the metabolites among the three groups were distributed in different regions. The different potential metabolic markers between the patients with or without greasy coating were 3 -ketolactose, 2 -deoxy-D-ribose, UDP-D-galactose metarhodopsin, ascorbate, picolinate and histidine. The different potential metabolic markers between the greasy coating group and the normal group were 3 -ketolactose, UDP-D-galactose, leukotriene A 4 and vitamin D 2. CONCLUSION: The metabolites of the greasy coating group, the <b>non-greasy</b> coating group and the normal group show significant differences in energy metabolism, mainly of glucose metabolism. This demonstrated that glucose metabolism {{may be one of}} the mechanisms leading to the formation of greasy coating...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In a {{double-blind}} study, {{betamethasone dipropionate}} (0. 05 percent) and betamethasone valerate (0. 12 percent) were randomly evaluated in eczemas and other steriod-responsive dermatoses. The former was dispensed in a propylene glycol vehicle, {{while the latter}} had the usual <b>non-greasy</b> ointment basic. The improvement was assessed by the reduction in erythema, induration and pruritus {{in the course of}} 3 weeks. It was apparent from the analysis of the data that the preceding parameters in patients on Cream-A showed a statistically significant improvement over those receiving Cream-B week by week. Further the overall assessment showed a remarkable response in patients in patients on Cream-A. The side effects of Cream-A included transient sensation of burning or stinging. The Cream-B in addition, caused local swelling, pain and pruritus in some of the patients...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Pharmaceutical semisolid {{preparations}} include ointments, pastes, cream, emulsions, gels {{and rigid}} foams. They serve as carriers for {{drugs that are}} topically delivered {{by way of the}} skin, cornea, rectal tissue, nasal mucosa, vagina, buccal tissue, urethral membrane, and external ear lining. Semisolids can adhere to the application surface for sufficiently long periods before they are washed off. This property helps prolong drug delivery at the application site. Novel semisolids are <b>non-greasy</b> since they are made up of water washable bases. Hence they cause less irritation to skin and are superior to conventional semisolid dosage form. Now a day, novel creams are available in the market provided with nano particles and microspheres. Similarly, novel gels are available including micro emulsion gel, bioadhesive gel, organogel, thermosensitive sol-gel, pH responsive complexation gel etc. Oleaginous ointments are preferred for dry, chapped skin in an environment of low humidity because of it...|$|E
40|$|Cosmetic Serum is {{a highly}} {{concentrated}} product based on water or oil. When using concentrates we get not only a quick cosmetic effect, but also psychological satisfaction after the treatment because {{the result will be}} seen practically immediately. Serum has a property of rapid absorption and ability to penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin, together with its <b>non-greasy</b> finish and intensive formula with a very high concentration of active substances. Based on these properties, the aim of this work was to formulate a fairness serum using poly herbal extracts. The objective was to carry out extraction, and to study the phyto-constituents responsible for the fairness action in the poly herbal extract and to evaluate various physicochemical and biological properties of the formulation. The fairness Serum has a super-special blend of active natural ingredients to penetrate skin‟s epidermis and color cells, resulting in fair complexion and skin tone in addition. It has skin smoothing ingredients to improve skin texture and leaves skin soft, fair and silky smooth. It is made of extracts of Glycyrrhiza glabra, Crocus sativus, Rice branand olive oil in addition. The variousphysical, chemical and biological evaluations were done. The formulationwas found to be of good spreadability and was free from heavy metals. Skin irritation studies proved that it was non-sensitizing and free to use. It is intended to provide fairness action within a week...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{scope of}} this study was to {{preserve}} whole detailed structure of dissected and decalcified bones, taken from used cadavers, by a new plastination technique. Materials and Methods: Specimens we used in this study were sheep femurs and human bones including pelvis, femur, tibia, and fibula. Bones, at first, fixed with 5 % formalin and were decalcified with 5 % nitric acid, and then were fixed again and washed under the tap water. The resulted flexible bones were dehydrated in - 25 ΀C acetone and degreased them in + 25 ΀C acetone. Then, the experimental and control specimen were placed in the vacuum chamber for forced impregnation with our new flexible unsaturated polyester resin (UP 89 method) and silicon resin (S 10 method), respectively. Finally, the strength and flexibility of plastinated decalcified specimens were investigated by tensometer, and the weight diversity was measured by digital balance. Results: Plastinated bones prepared by this technique were found to be dried, non-fragile, durable, odorless, <b>non-greasy,</b> and demonstrating all detailed structures of the bones. Tensile and weight tests results indicated that plastinated decalcified femurs have owned higher flexibility and strength but lesser weight than plastinated undecalcified femurs. The characteristics of both experimental and control groups of plastinated decalcified specimens were found to have no significant difference. Conclusions: Our synthesized resin found to be much more economical than conventional plastination method. In more details, properties of these new products were the same as, S 10 method, from points of strength, flexibility and weight, but, since the money cost for producing them was about one fifth that of S 10 method...|$|E
40|$|PhD (Pharmaceutics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Dosage forms {{have been}} {{developed}} over the years for various applications. The dosage form consists of the active drug in combination with pharmaceutical excipients. The pharmaceutical excipients solubilise, suspend, thicken, dilute, emulsify, stabilise, preserve, colour and flavour medicinal agents into efficacious and appealing dosage forms. The dosage form under investigation {{in this study is}} of the oral type. The Pheroid® is a unique drug delivery system which consists of an oil-in-water emulsion system. Emulsion based drug systems provide a suitable medium for the delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs which can be incorporated into its oil or water phase for delivery to the site of action. These advantages make them more efficient as dosage form. Emulgels are either emulsion of oil-in-water or water-in-oil type, which is gelled by mixing with gelling agents. Incorporation of emulsion into gel increases its stability and makes it a dual control release system. The presence of the gel phase makes it a <b>non-greasy</b> formulation which favours good patient compliance. A strategy followed to improve the stability of the emulgel system is the packaging of the formula into single dose sachets to protect the product against physical and chemical breakdown during patient usage. All factors such as selection of gelling agent, preservatives and formulation methods influencing the stability and efficacy of Pheroid® emulgel are discussed. In this study, three different emulsifiers were added to the formula and the analysis of visual appearance, pH measurements, rheological studies, light microscopy and confocol laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) will provide an insight to the potential usage of emulgel as drug delivery system. A range of para-hydroxybenzoate esters was tested in the Pheroid® emulgel and the most suitable candidate chosen for further accelerated stability testing. It was thus possible to prepare a single dose emulgel with Carbopol® 934 P (0. 2 % w/v) as an emulsifier, with Nipastat® (0. 175 % w/v) and PG (10 % v/v) as preservatives into a stable dosage form suitable for further product development.
