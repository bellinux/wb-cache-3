5|$|Although {{the city}} is the most {{populated}} of Extremadura, it has a relatively low population density (102.30 hab/km²), due to the extension of its municipality, {{one of the largest}} in Spain, with an area of 1,470km². It should be <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> addition to the metropolitan centre the population includes districts, neighborhoods and towns with small populations, the most populous of which is Guadiana del Caudillo, which had 2,524 people as of 2012, but gained independence on 17 February 2012.|$|E
5|$|Due to his {{resemblance}} to Ventus, video game publications initially thought that Roxas {{would be one}} of the protagonists from Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. However, when it was revealed that the two were different, publications still discussed how similar they were and if there was a connection between them. Bob Muir from Destructoid <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Birth by Sleep Ventus was the most important character by fans due to his similarities with Roxas.|$|E

5|$|Heathen groups {{assemble}} for rituals {{in order}} to mark rites of passage, seasonal observances, oath takings, rites devoted to a specific deity, and for rites of need. These rites also serve as identity practices which mark the adherents out as Heathens. Strmiska <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Iceland, Ásatrú rituals had been deliberately constructed {{in an attempt to}} recreate or pay tribute to the ritual practices of pre-Christian Icelanders, although there was also space in which these rituals could reflect innovation, changing {{in order to}} suit the tastes and needs of contemporary practitioners.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the {{original}} Akkadian, Ú-a-a-te {{is used to}} refer to the first names of both Yauta ibn Hazail (son of Hazael) and Uayte ben Birdadda (son of Birdadda). The latter is also sometimes referred to as Ia-u-ta- and in the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, the two spellings were confused, with both written Ú-a-a-te. The transliteration of the original Akkadian into English is highly unstable and only some of the alternate spellings appear in this article.|$|E

After Itachi's death, the two actors <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the end Itachi served as a good old brother to Sasuke.

The $2.4 billion extension was funded with New York City funds from municipal Tax Increment Financing (TIF) bond sales that are expected to be repaid with property tax revenues from future developments in areas served by the extension.|$|E
5|$|Pilots <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a crosswind, {{the nose}} of the plane would not point {{directly}} at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, to compensate for the wind. Since making the beams bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to fly on the curving approach path which keeps the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} portrayed Madonna dancing {{in front of}} a white background, {{accompanied}} by her dancers. After the video was released, Madonna's style and mannerisms became a fashion trend among the younger generation.

She referred to herself as the lucky star, unlike the lyrical meaning of the song. Madonna has performed the song in a number of live appearances, most recently at the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). It has also been covered by a number of artists.|$|E

5|$|Vladimir Ćorović <b>noted</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> {{comparison}} with Dušan, {{who had also}} left a considerably extended state, Tvrtko was not an overly ambitious conqueror so much as he was an able statesman. Tvrtko, he wrote, used force when necessary but otherwise took care to appear to Serbians as the legitimate heir {{rather than as a}} foreign subjugator and to the Croatians as the preferable ruler. Emphasizing his patience and diplomacy, Ćorović calls Tvrtko a man capable of making the most out of his opportunities.|$|E
5|$|According to Schafer, Brütal Legend {{had been}} in {{development}} since 2007, prior to the completion of Psychonauts. Schafer <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Psychonauts, they attempted to bring together a lot of assets, including characters and environments, but {{were not able to}} successfully integrate them on their first attempt and had to start over on the development of some. In several cases for Psychonauts, changes made in gameplay required them to return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the scrum development approach for Brütal Legend, which they found worked well with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone. For example, the team was able to bring about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, the ability for Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E

5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped spores with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two and four sessile spores that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment. The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the spores may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Lim mooted {{the idea}} that the {{proportion}} of each Primary 1 cohort that would be seeking a university education should be increased beyond the 30% by 2015 that the Government was planning. She <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in 2006 about 37% of each age cohort received a degree-level education, and that a sizeable number of Singaporean students who failed to gain entry into local universities had done well in reputable universities overseas. She also suggested giving concessionary fares to disabled individuals who make up 2% of the adult population under 60 years.|$|E
5|$|Lara {{appealed the}} denial of his motion to dismiss to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court {{obtained}} its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the jurisdictional system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said the money would be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{oral traditions}} about the castle survive. One of these {{involves}} a child prisoner within the castle, who escaped, throwing {{the key to}} her dungeon into a nearby field, sometimes argued to be an outcrop of land north-west of the castle, which from then onwards was infertile. Another centres on a man called Gallon who was left {{in charge of the}} castle by Margaret of Anjou and entrusted with a set of valuables; captured by the Yorkists, he escaped and later returned to reclaim six Venetian glasses. The historian Katrina Porteous has <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the 14th century there are records of receivers and bailiffs at the castle called Galoun, potentially linked to the origins of the Gallon of this story.|$|E
