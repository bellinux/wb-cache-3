5|$|A second {{full-size}} {{replica of}} Endeavour is berthed on the River Tees in Stockton-on-Tees. While this reflects the external dimensions of Cook's vessel, this replica was constructed with a steel {{rather than a}} timber frame, has one less internal deck than the original, and is <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be put to sea.|$|E
5|$|Culturally {{inappropriate}} decision making: The Organisation is <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> {{deal with}} cultural issues or complex social problems; the normal Indigenous decision-making processes and protocols such as consultation and input from family groupings are not structurally accommodated.|$|E

5|$|These animals exploit more {{man-made}} environments like docks for haul-out sites. Many docks are <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> {{withstand the}} weight of several resting sea lions which cause major tilting and other problems. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand them.|$|E
5|$|A {{complementary}} telescope, {{looking at}} even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory, launched on May 14, 2009. Like JWST, Herschel was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be serviced after launch, {{and had a}} mirror substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in the far infrared and submillimeter. It needed helium coolant, of which it ran out on April 29, 2013.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be a technology demonstrator, unlike its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Past the Garden State Parkway, Route 3 {{eventually}} {{turns into}} a six-lane freeway that is <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> Interstate Highway standards. It interchanges with County Route 622 (Bloomfield Avenue), then intersects County Route 603 (Passaic Avenue), which heads south into Nutley to become Route 7. The next interchange is for County Route 601 (Main Avenue). Past that interchange, Route 3 comes to an interchange with Route 21, then passes over the route.|$|E
5|$|The Don Valley Parkway, {{along with}} the Gardiner Expressway, is one of Toronto's busiest {{municipal}} routes. It is the sole north–south expressway into Toronto's downtown, a role it was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> support. The parkway was planned {{as one of a}} series of expressways to provide commuter routes to downtown from the expanding suburbs. Two other un-built expressways were planned: the Scarborough Expressway, expected to handle traffic between downtown and the eastern suburbs, and the Spadina Expressway, expected to serve traffic from the north-west.|$|E
5|$|The President of the Italian Republic has an {{official}} standard. The current version {{is based on}} the square flag of the Napoleonic Italian Republic, on a field of blue, charged with the coat of arms in gold. Prior to this the field was solid blue. The current coat of arms, more accurately called an emblem as it was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> conform to traditional heraldic rules, was adopted in place of the royal arms on 5 May 1948.|$|E

5|$|The game {{belongs to}} the Chrono series and is a gaiden, or side story, to the 1995 game Chrono Trigger. It was {{released}} to complement its predecessor's plot, and later served as inspiration for Chrono Cross. It features text-based gameplay with minimal graphics and sound effects, and was scored by composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Unlike many Satellaview titles, Radical Dreamers was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> lock after {{a certain number of}} playthroughs, so players owning an 8M Memory Pack onto which the game was downloaded can still play today.|$|E
5|$|The iPad syncs with iTunes on a Mac or Windows PC. Apple ported its iWork suite {{from the}} Mac to the iPad, and sells pared-down {{versions}} of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps in the App Store.

5|$|The keep was {{designed}} as a private tower for Hamelin Plantagenet, rather than a grander residence. As a result, it was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> accommodate several different households and its layout was simpler than that seen at the contemporary keep of Orford Castle, for example. The 2nd and the 3rd floor would have served as the main chamber and the lord's private chamber, forming a vertical sequence of rooms, with a vaulted, hexagonal chapel leading off the private chamber, cut into one of the buttresses.|$|E
5000|$|A sump buster is {{a device}} {{installed}} within a bus route to limit that thoroughfare to buses. It discourages traffic from entering a lane by promising {{to destroy the}} oil pan of any vehicle with insufficient ground clearance to get over it, making them similar in use (but <b>not</b> <b>design)</b> <b>to</b> rising bollards. A sump buster can also {{be known as a}} [...] "sump breaker" [...] or [...] "sump trap".|$|R

5|$|Also in 1928, she {{assisted}} in the search effort for the wrecked airship Italia, which had crashed on the polar ice northeast of Svalbard. In addition, Roald Amundsen, who had also joined the search effort, went missing himself. Strassbourg arrived in Tromsø, Norway, on 19 June, to search for both Italia and Amundsen's aircraft. The ship's bow was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> operate in an Arctic environment, and so the crew had to continually fix wood planks to the hull {{to protect it from}} the ice. While refueling from the tanker Durance, Strassbourg took on two FBA 17 seaplanes to assist in the search effort. On 30 August, Strassbourg located one of the floats from Amundsen's aircraft, confirming the loss of the plane. The search effort was called off on 17 September, and Strassbourg returned to Brest by way of Reykjavík, arriving back in France by mid October.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} spacecraft, the Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter, {{was designed}} to be sent to the Moon ahead of an Apollo mission. It would have landed close to the planned Apollo landing site, and if the Apollo Lunar Module's ascent stage failed to ignite, the crew would have performed an EVA to transfer to the LSSS. The shelter was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> take off again after landing, so an LSRS or another Apollo mission would then be sent to collect the crew, whilst the Command Module Pilot of the original Apollo mission would have returned to Earth alone aboard his spacecraft. It consisted of a Gemini Reentry Module, which would have housed the astronauts whilst they awaited rescue, and a descent stage containing life support systems, consumables, and the engine and propellant used to land the spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{claims that}} the battery for both generations of iPad can provide up to 10 hours of video, 140 hours of audio playback, or one month on standby. Like any {{rechargeable}} battery technology, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time, but is <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be user-replaceable. In a program similar to the battery-replacement program for the iPod and the original iPhone, Apple will replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished iPad for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping. As a different unit is supplied, user data is not preserved. The refurbished unit {{will have a new}} case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E

5|$|At Passo de Torres, many shipyards were destroyed, as {{they were}} <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> {{withstand}} the pressure differentials caused by Catarina's winds; widespread roof damage was reported at this municipality as well. Near the Mampituba River, a house was blown about 50meters (165ft) upstream, literally landing in another state: it originally {{was built in the}} Torres municipality of Rio Grande do Sul, yet it ended up in Passo de Torres, within Santa Catarina. In rural areas, the corn, banana, and rice fields received the most damage, although rice farmers were able to partially recoup their losses, as they had harvested before Catarina made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{counter-terrorism}} agency NCTb {{said that}} it had started a probe into where the suspect originated. Dutch officials also said that they will now use 3D full-body scanning X-ray technology on flights departing to the U.S., despite protests from privacy advocates. Dutch officials said that security must take priority over {{the privacy of the}} individuals being scanned, but the scanners are <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> compromise an individual's privacy, as the imagery resolution is only high enough to detect non-metallic objects under clothing, such as powdered explosives. Members of the Second Chamber (Lower House) of the Dutch parliament demanded an explanation from Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin, asking how the suspect managed to smuggle explosives on board, despite Schiphol's reportedly strict security measures.|$|E
5|$|Following post-storm surveys, it was {{determined}} that most of the severely damaged schools were built improperly and the upper-floors were <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> bear typhoon-force winds. According to building codes in Thailand, structures are mandated to be able to withstand up to 120kgf/m2 of pressure from winds. In the years following the typhoon, studies by engineers were conducted in the hardest hit regions to determine how to best rebuild structures in the country. With many of the destroyed structures being constructed from wood, reinforced concrete structures were the suggested replacement. The new buildings could last up to 50 years with proper construction; however, sub-standard building would result in a need for repairs within five years.|$|E
