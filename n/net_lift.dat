50|$|The {{fundamentals}} of bird flight {{are similar to}} those of aircraft, in which the aerodynamic forces sustaining flight are lift and drag.

5000|$|When ice {{builds up}} by either {{freezing}} upon impingement {{on the leading}} edge or freezing as runback on aerodynamic lift or thrust surfaces, such as the wing, tailplane, and propeller blades, the modification of airflow changes the aerodynamic performance of the surfaces by modifying either their shape and/or their surface characteristics.

Depending on whether the <b>net</b> <b>lift</b> of a tailplane airfoil was downward or upward, then the loss of tailplane lift (upward or downward) can cause a change in pitch (often to a more nose down pitch) or, if the critical angle of attack of the tailplane is exceeded, a tailplane aerodynamic [...] "stall".|$|E

40|$|Despite intense {{study by}} {{physicists}} and biologists, {{we do not}} fully understand the unsteady aerodynamics that relate insect wing morphology and kinematics to lift generation. Here, we formulate a force partitioning method (FPM) and implement it within a computational fluid dynamic model to provide an unambiguous and physically insightful division of aerodynamic force into components associated with wing kinematics, vorticity, and viscosity. Application of the FPM to hawkmoth and fruit fly flight shows that the leading-edge vortex is the dominant mechanism for lift generation for both these insects and contributes between 72 - 85 % of the <b>net</b> <b>lift.</b> However, there is another, previously unidentified mechanism, the centripetal acceleration reaction, which generates up to 17 % of the <b>net</b> <b>lift.</b> The centripetal acceleration reaction {{is similar to the}} classical inviscid added-mass in that it depends only on the kinematics (i. e. accelerations) of the body, but is different in that it requires the satisfaction of the no-slip condition, and a combination of tangential motion and rotation of the wing surface. Furthermore, the classical added-mass force is identically zero for cyclic motion but this is not true of the centripetal acceleration reaction. Furthermore, unlike the lift due to vorticity, centripetal acceleration reaction lift is insensitive to Reynolds number and to environmental flow perturbations, making it an important contributor to insect flight stability and miniaturization. This force mechanism also has broad implications for flow-induced deformation and vibration, underwater locomotion and flows involving bubbles and droplets...|$|E
