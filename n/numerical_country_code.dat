5000|$|The use of {{an initial}} letter [...] "X" [...] for these {{purposes}} is facilitated by the ISO 3166 rule that no official <b>country</b> <b>code</b> beginning with X will ever be assigned.

For instance, the ISO 3166-based NATO <b>country</b> <b>codes</b> (STANAG 1059, 9th edition) use [...] "X" [...] codes for imaginary exercise countries ranging from XXB for [...] "Brownland" [...] to XXR for [...] "Redland", {{as well as for}} major commands such as XXE for SHAPE or XXS for SACLANT. Consequently, ISO 4217 can use [...] "X" [...] codes for non-country-specific currencies without risk of clashing with future <b>country</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R
