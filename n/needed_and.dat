Additional artillery support was also made available, with 161st Field Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery airlifted into Fire Support Base Giraffe.

5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately <b>needed,</b> <b>and</b> recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this article}} is to {{contribute}} to the development of the modern theory of lexicographical functions by offering a critical examination of the following concepts associated with it: primary needs, primary data, secondary needs, secondary data, function-related <b>needs,</b> <b>and</b> function-related data. By way of introduction, a presentation of the basic tenets of the theory is offered, fol-lowed by a description of the general characteristics of secondary <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> data. Next, on the basis of both a critical analysis of the theory and an examination of selected data types in existing lexicographical products, it is argued that all user <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> all data that satisfy those needs are function-related. The distinction between the concepts function-related and usage-related is thus rejected. Since this has serious implications for the relation between secondary <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> data on the one hand <b>and</b> primary <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> data on the other, this relation is subsequently reconsidered. This leads to a redefinition of all the concepts examined. It is also explained why an ideal state of lexicography, where secondary <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> data do not exist, cannot be achieved in the real world...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Patients' {{oral health}} needs are {{estimated}} through dialogue and professional assessment. The concepts of <b>need</b> <b>and</b> demand {{are vital to}} studies of dental care <b>and</b> oral health. <b>Need</b> does not always lead to demand for treatment or to utilization, depending on the gatekeeping processes between <b>need</b> <b>and</b> demand and between demand and utilization. Demand must be accepted {{with the understanding that}} there is no objective <b>need</b> <b>and</b> that demand depends on the patient's opinion. In accordance with this, the need for prosthodontic treatment is highly individual and is not automatically related to oral health status, making <b>need</b> <b>and</b> demand difficult to measure in that respect. Therefore, sociodental factors should be included and evaluated in studies of <b>need</b> <b>and</b> demand for utilization of prosthodontic care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This theoretical and analytic paper focuses on the gatekeeping processes between <b>need</b> <b>and</b> demand and between demand and utilization of prosthodontic care. RESULTS: The concept of gatekeeping refers to the social and psychologic processes that transform <b>need</b> into demand <b>and</b> demand into utilization. It implies that they are complex processes that can render great differences between demand and actual utilization. CONCLUSION: It is not possible to estimate a patient's needs for prosthodontic care, since there is no objective <b>need.</b> Demand <b>and</b> utilization are factors that {{play an important role in}} the gatekeeping process. These factors are dependent on the patient's opinion, which is influenced by numerous factors...|$|R
