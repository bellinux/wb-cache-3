50|$|Requisitioned vehicles, {{before they}} {{received}} their full markings, displayed WD in 6 inch {{letters on the}} <b>nearside</b> <b>front</b> and back.|$|E
50|$|The {{front seats}} are easily moveable. There is a {{ventilator}} in the scuttle. The rear-most glasses {{of the six}} side windows are fixed while the middle ones can be wound down more than half-way and the forward ones fully. The one-piece windscreen opens out fully. The spare wheel and tyre are in a well in the <b>nearside</b> <b>front</b> wing, tools in a locked cupboard under the bonnet. The metal panelled saloon can be had in three colours.|$|E
5000|$|In his Classic Blunderbus {{column on}} the type in Classic Bus 63, the current Buses Magazine editor Alan Millar {{explained}} {{that it was a}} lightweight version of the Leyland-MCW Olympic, and as that used Leyland Royal Tiger or Royal Tiger Worldmaster components, so this used Leyland Tiger Cub units. The name Olympian was he says adopted because Olympic Cub would have sounded [...] "plain daft"; that said Leyland coded the type HRC (or, for the sole left hand drive version, ELC) where HR or EL was a mnemonic for [...] "Olympic" [...] and C meant [...] "Cub". Completed examples were only 3cwt lighter than Tiger Cub chassis with the same maker's body. In appearance there was little to tell them apart save that the Olympian was differently badged and had a water filler cap aperture mounted behind and slightly above the centre line of the <b>nearside</b> <b>front</b> wheel; The Tiger Cub's water filler cap was higher mounted and generally hidden by a sprung flap. With 60 built and six exported this was the least successful postwar Leyland single deck, none were built after the Chinese example even though Leyland Motors were still advertising its availability in a 1964 booklet. But Leyland kept hold of their registration of the name, and it came in handy for the Project B45 Leyland Olympian in 1980.|$|E
50|$|Originally only {{available}} on the Volvo B12B chassis, the Levante enabled both able-bodied and wheelchair passengers to enter the vehicle via the front door, {{using a combination of}} a front-mounted lift and two single pedestal-mounted seats in place of the traditional double at the <b>front</b> <b>nearside</b> of the passenger area.|$|R
50|$|The {{sign was}} {{affixed to the}} <b>front</b> <b>nearside</b> bumper, or close to it, such as a forward facing wing, and in a {{prominent}} position at the rear, also on the nearside. Similar size to the Arm of Service (AoS) 9 inch square sign. Not supposed to be carried on motorbikes, but sometimes painted on sides of their fuel tank.|$|R
50|$|The Enviro400 {{features}} an innovative seating layout that maximises use of seating {{space on the}} lower deck by placing two forward-facing moulded seats onto the <b>front</b> <b>nearside</b> wheelarch box with a small luggage shelf on the rear half, and also (on full-height models) a single forward-facing moulded seat on the front off-side wheelarch hub between the driver's partition and the staircase.|$|R
2500|$|The GP Version R {{model was}} {{produced}} in Scotia White, Passion Red or Pyrenées Black only. It featured HID headlamps; Black rear seats, with color-coded [...] "FTO" [...] monogrammed front seats - Blue/with Scotia White body color, Black/with Passion Red body color or Red/with Pyrenées Black body color; uprated suspension - 20mm front anti roll bar instead of 17mm and a 20mm rear anti roll bar rather than 18mm; limited slip differential and the redesigned rear aero spoiler. A [...] "Version R" [...] decal also features on the two spoiler side wings and on the <b>nearside</b> of the <b>front</b> lip. As this model was lightweight, items such as side skirts, front fog lights, climate control, electric folding mirrors and sound insulation were left out.

50|$|Hocking {{was deeply}} {{affected}} {{by the death of}} his friend, Tom Phillis at the 1962 Isle of Man TT. After winning the Senior TT, he announced his retirement from motorcycle racing and returned to Rhodesia. He felt motorcycle racing was too dangerous and decided a career in auto racing would be safer. Later that year, on the 22nd of December he was killed during practice for the 1962 Natal Grand Prix at the Westmead circuit. His car, a Rob Walker entered Lotus 24, ran {{off the edge of the}} track at the end of the long right hand corner & somersaulted end over end twice. Gary's head struck the roll hoop & he died some hours later in the Addington hospital in Durban. It is possible that the car suffered a <b>front</b> <b>nearside</b> suspension failure & this caused the car to veer sharply to the left & somersault. He was 25 years old. Hocking is buried at Christchurch Cemetery, Newport, Gwent in Wales.|$|R

5000|$|As {{they come}} to the elbow, Seabass is not done with, Katie Walsh is coming back and Neptune Collonges is joining in as well. It's Sunnyhillboy with 100 yards left to go, Neptune Collonges digging deep on the <b>nearside.</b> Sunnyhillboy in <b>front</b> - he's {{shortening}} his stride, he's a half-length in front! Neptune Collonges is diving in and - oh, it's tight! It's very tight between Sunnyhillboy and Neptune Collonges - a photo in the Grand National! BBC commentator Jim McGrathdescribes the climax of the race. As the Grand National is accorded the status of an event of national interest in the United Kingdom and is listed on the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events, it is always shown on free-to-air terrestrial television in the UK. The rights to broadcast the race were held by the BBC and the National, along with several other races during the day, was shown on BBC One and the BBC HD channel. This was the 53rd consecutive year the BBC has televised the Grand National and the last time before Channel 4 took over broadcasting rights for a four-year period from 2013.|$|R
5000|$|After the trams {{finished}} in December 1949, the Shirley Tram Depot was {{converted into a}} bus garage and was first used on 16 July 1950, therefore {{reducing the number of}} empty runs of trips from Shirley to Portswood, saving time and resources. In 1951 with housing developments rapidly being built in Millbrook and Harefield, new bus services were needed. Two years after the abandonment of the tram network the Transport Department found itself cutting services because of financial problems. The chief problem was that too many [...] "dead" [...] mileages were being run and some services were not carrying sufficient passengers. The summer of 1952 saw the long-awaited high capacity Standee buses being delivered. The Standees were used on services 5A, 8 and 16, and these routes’serviced the Woolston and Bitterne areas of the city. With the Shirley Depot becoming fully capable of dealing with most routine maintenance and some body work, Portswood nevertheless remained the most important depot of the two as it had a body shop, paint shop and also had equipment for all major mechanical repairs. Buses that were stored at Shirley carried [...] "S" [...] on the <b>nearside</b> upper deck <b>front</b> panel.|$|R
40|$|In traffic systems where {{driving is}} on the left, right-turning {{movements}} tend {{to be difficult to}} efficiently accommodate at signal controlled junctions. A hook turn is one potential solution for this. A hook turn is where a right turn is made from the nearside lane rather than an offside lane at a four-leg signalised junction. After entering the junction, the turning vehicle waits at a <b>nearside</b> position in <b>front</b> of the side road stop line, and then proceeds toward the exit arm when the side road signal turns green The research described in this paper uses microscopic simulation modelling in an innovative way to compare the traffic performance of a hypothetical hook-turn junction with an equivalent conventional junction with opposed right turns. The simulation model evaluated traffic performance under various combinations of demand flow, turning proportions, and signal timings. It was found that hook turns reduced delays to through traffic from the same approach in nearly all cases. Overall junction performance depended on the scale of any increased delays to left-turning traffic and side road traffic resulting from the hook-turn movement. It is concluded that hook turns could be used much more widely than at present—including where driving {{is on the}} right—offering significant operational benefits in the right circumstances...|$|R
40|$|This {{briefing}} summarises a {{study by}} a research team from the Design School at Loughborough University for Transport for London (TfL) and Transport & Environment (T&E) on how lorry direct vision could be improved. Previous {{research has shown that}} existing Category N 3 vehicle designs exhibit considerable direct vision blind spots in front of and to the near (passenger) side of the vehicle. This research explores the potential to reduce these blind spots through changes to vehicle geometry made possible by the proposed increase to vehicle length. Using a concept vehicle designed in a project performed by FKA this research evaluates the direct vision afforded to the driver against a baseline DAF XF 105 and a range of iterations of the FKA concept to explore improvements to vision. The analyses are performed using a 3 D projection technique in the SAMMIE digital human modelling system. This allows the vehicle concepts to be populated with representative drivers and visual targets including vulnerable road users in the form of pedestrians and cyclists and a typical Category M 1 vehicle (a passenger car). The analysis has shown that these blind spots can be improved for the specific tests that have been performed in this research by the FKA concept and the iterations of the concept that have been produced by the LDS team. When compared to the baseline vehicle the original FKA concept improves direct vision to vulnerable road users located at the centre of the vehicle front as the extended front effectively pushes the visual targets further away {{from the front of the}} vehicle allowing them to be seen. The visibility to the two front corners of the FKA concept and the lateral visibility through the driver and passenger doors remain problematic. The first iteration of the FKA concept reduces obscuration through the design of a compact instrument panel similar to those used in bus and coach designs. This iteration also improves direct vision to the near side and <b>front</b> <b>nearside</b> corner of the vehicle through the use of additional glazed areas. The visibility of the offside front corner is still problematic. The second iteration of the FKA concept is a modified version of the first iteration with a reduction in the cab height of the vehicle by 230 mm. This results in the most successful concept analysed, with good direct vision of all of the visual targets that have been defined in the research project. This reduction in height is possible with current vehicles but would result in a vehicle with reduced off road capabilities due to a reduction in ground clearance. The third iteration of the FKA concept explored the potential of a central driving position. This provides advantages to direct vision through improved lateral visibility at the original height of the concept vehicle. However, this iteration also introduces new direct vision issues. The project has shown that the potential to extend the front of category N 3 vehicles to include aerodynamic features has some benefit in terms of improved direct vision for the design that has been analysed, but that more radical design solutions, such as lowering the vehicle cab, and adding glazed areas to the doors and below the windscreen bottom edge provide more effective solutions to the direct vision problem...|$|R
