The optical path length of the reference beam course is so selected, that this is equal to the optical path length of the measuring beam course, for the object placed with its surface at the focal point.

PePSi is made by alternating strain gradients along the waveguide using periodic arrangement of stressed cladding layers. OCIS codes: (190. 4390) Nonlinear optics: Nonlinear optics, integrated optics; (190. 2620) Harmonic generation and mixing. In addition to its indirect bandgap, silicon’s most fundamental optical limitation is its centrosymmetric crystal structure that prevents second-order nonlinearity [1], a requisite property for making electrooptic switches, modulators and parametric wave conversion. Fortunately, perturbation of crystal symmetry gets around the limitation by applying inhomogeneous mechanical stress (strain gradient) to the crystal [2 - 11]. To create efficient nonlinear optical devices, in 2009 we announced a new concept: the Periodically Poled Silicon (PePSi) [6 - 8]. PePSi creates alternating stress gradients along a silicon waveguide using a periodic arrangement of stressed cladding films (see Figure 1). The structure creates appreciable χ(2) and simultaneously achieves quasi-phase matching (QPM).

The understanding of crystallization processes in glasses implied to investigate their structure. The environment around Ti, Zr (nucleating agents) and Nd was characterized for various Nd 2 O 3 loadings. Electron spin resonance study of {{the small amount of}} Ti 3 + occurring in glasses enabled to identify two types of sites for titanium. EXAFS showed that Zr occupied a quite well defined 6 - 7 -fold site coordinated by oxygen at 2. 20 Å, with second neighbors that could correspond to Ca/Ti and Zr around 3. 5 Å. This short range order presents some similarities with zirconolite, which could predispose glass to zirconolite nucleation. Nd environment was probed by optical spectroscopies, ESR and EXAFS.

40|$|Background: In {{all species}} studied, myopia {{develops}} if {{the eye is}} deprived of detailed vision during development (form deprivation myopia). However, different degrees of spatial image deprivation produce different effects and have not been described in the mammalian eye. Therefore, the effect of image degradation on guinea pig emmetropisation was investigated. Methods: Eighty-one guinea pigs wore a treatment on one eye from 6 to 13 [*]days of age. There were four treatments: a translucent diffuser (no lines or edges were visible through the diffuser); one of five Bangerter foils (BF: 0. 8, 0. 6, 0. 4, 0. 2, light perception only), which differed in their cut-off spatial frequencies; a ‘ring mount’ control with no filter; or one of two neutral density filters that reduced luminance only (<b>ND,</b> <b>optical</b> density grades 0. 1 and 0. 6). Refractive error and ocular elongation were measured after seven days of treatment. Results: The extent of induced myopia and ocular growth {{were related to the}} amount of image degradation (mean difference between the treated and untreated eyes changed in a graded manner − 7. 0 [*]D to − 0. 2 [*]D and from 85 [*]μm to seven μm respectively, for spatial frequency cut-offs between zero and 24 [*]cycles per degree). Corresponding reductions in luminance from ND filters did not increase eye growth and caused significantly less myopia than the BFs that caused a similar luminance decrement. The greatest myopia occurred when no or limited spatial information was available to the eye, but moderate myopia still occurred with spatial frequency cut-offs of six and 12 [*]cycles per degree, well beyond the visual acuity range of guinea pigs. Conclusion: Excessive ocular growth and myopia are most robust when induced by spatial frequency reductions within the visual acuity range but can also be induced beyond this. Either the mechanism of ocular growth can detect supra-threshold spatial frequencies, possibly due to aliasing, or it is sensitive to small amounts of contrast degradation...|$|E

However, the combination of nanoscale geometries with the high refractive index contrast creates high optical intensities where 3 rd order effects may become important, and in fact, may be exploited. In this context, we study the two main nonlinear processes that can occur in silicon waveguides, namely Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) from zone-center optical phonons and Two-Photon Absorption (TPA). Because of the single crystal structure, the Raman gain coefficient in silicon is several orders of magnitude larger than that in the (amorphous) glass fiber while its bandwidth is limited to approximately 100 GHz. To achieve Raman gain in the 1550 nm region requires the pump to be centered at around 1427 nm. We discuss the Raman selection rules in a silicon waveguide and present the design of an SOI Raman amplifier. We show that by causing pump depletion, TPA can limit the amount of achievable Raman gain. TPA also limits the maximum optical SNR of the silicon amplifier. 1...|$|R
40|$|Optical flow is an {{important}} research area in the Computer Vision field, with the estimation of optical flow at occlusion still an open problem. Traditional approaches to this problem have either used additional terms in a regularization calculation (the flow still tends to “bleed” across occlusion boundaries) or a local least squares calculation that attempted to minimize the influence of two adjacent differently moving regions on the optical flow at points close to both regions (the flow still tends to be “corrupted” by the two regions). Ideally, optical flow for two adjacent differently moving regions should be distinct {{right up to the}} occlusion boundary. A recent approach to calculate optical flow at occlusion is to combining boundary and region segmentation with the optical flow computation. Based on the work of Sundberg et al. Arbelaez et al. and Brox et al., we implement a motion gradient (mg) edge map algorithm which detects motion information in closed regions in the image sequences. Here we utilize the motion gradient as an additional local cue in the globalized probability of a boundary (gPb) as a new boundary detector to produce a gPb + mg contour map. The next step is to apply the Ultrametric Contour Map (UCM) mechanism, which is a framework to compute closed contours in a hierarchical region tree to produce a hierarchical edge map which indicates possible boundaries, including occlusion boundaries. We implemented Sundberg et al. ’s work to detect occlusion boundaries using optical flow, but, unlike Sundberg et al., we compute and display optical flow everywhere. The Sundberg et al. optical flow was generated by Brox et al’s method. They used a least squares calcula- tion on the brox flow at pixels around an occlusion boundary to determine whether a boundary computed by the gPb − UCM library developed by UC Berkeley is occluding or occluded. We extended their least squares idea to 1 st and 2 <b>nd</b> order <b>optical</b> flow models to generate dense opti- cal flow inside each closed region. Finally, we analyze our optical flow fields both qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, for quantitative analysis, we use warping error, as the correct flow is unknown. We show improved results over those of Sundberg et al., note a number of shortcomings in Sundberg et al. ’s approach and point to areas of future research...|$|R

Pictures that do not depict challenge the visual basis of the ego and its others, confronting what I call the `Phallic reader' (who sees according to the logic and rules of the Phallogocentric system he inhabits) and potentially disturbing his sense of the visible. The Phallic reader, the visible and the seeing ego's sense of how to see, meet in what I call the `psychic surface'. Deploying this notion of a `psychic surface' allows for readings which move on from the potentially confining logic of the Phallus. Paradoxically, the psychic structure of monochrome's liminal blankness is homologous to the indeterminate Mixed Race subject, whose body transgresses not only the foundational historical binarism of `Black/White', but also Lacanian psychoanalysis. This thesis aims to concentrate on exploring blank spaces, with particular reference to the monochrome within western Art History. Building on the considerable work since at least the 1960 s that critiques the binary logocentrism of Eurocentric, Hegelian-originated Art History, this thesis aims to explore the specific ways monochrome evades, undermines and tricks commonly accepted `groundrules' of Art History. The Phallic reader is severely restricted in understanding that which falls outside of the signifying logic of a particular system of Art History that follows a binary, teleological and Phallogocentric course. Both monochrome and the Mixed Race subject fall outside of this logic, as both contain the structure of the trick. In each case, the trick is activated in the tension between the prychica <b>nd</b> the <b>opticals</b> urfaces. I suggestt hat monochrome's psychic space is pre-Phallic, a space of eternal deferral of meaning, a space that playfully makes a nonsense of binary structures. Psychoanalysis is largely used here as an analytic tool, but also appears as an object of critique. Art History provides an anchor for the optical surfaces under discussion. Theories of `radical superficiality' both contradict and complement these ways of theorising the psychic surface. The trick/ster is a significant/signifiant means of deploying interdisciplinary methodologies to negotiate this difficult terrain between Black, White and monochrome. An interdisciplinary approach also enacts the psychic structure of indeterminacy of my objects of study. I hope that by proposing a potential transgressive power for those indeterminate things that continue to confound the binary systems that aim to contextualise and confine them, I will contribute to the areas of Visual Culture and `Race' Theory...|$|R
30|$|We have {{recently}} proposed a fabrication process of Si nanodisk (ND) arrays, where the Si NDs are formed by damage-free neutral beam (NB) etching for Si thin films covered with etching masks of Fe nanoparticles which are regularly aligned by bio-protein engineering[15 – 20]. This fabrication process using the bio-templates {{enables us to}} prepare closely packed high-density Si NDs with the intentionally designed precise size and spacing in a nanometric scale with flexible film stacking. We have also observed intense photoluminescence (PL) emissions in a visible light region with fast decay times ranging from 10 ps to 2 ns[20]. The fast decaying PL characteristics reflect the dynamics of photo-excited carriers in this high-density Si ND array system, in which wavefunctions of photo-excited carriers overlap among Si NDs to some extent, and the carriers can transfer among the NDs[20]. Photo-generated or electrically injected carriers need to be effectively transferred among Si <b>NDs</b> for the <b>optical</b> applications to solar cells or light-emitting diodes. The spatial transfer of the carriers in nanostructures can also be affected by thermal effects, such as thermal hopping or escape. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the detailed temperature dependence of time-resolved PL and the related carrier dynamics in these high-density Si ND arrays. Different types of PL quenching mechanism can be identified, and the activation energies for the PL thermal quenching are deduced from the temperature dependences of the PL intensity. The difference of the activation energy between different decaying PL components supports the existence of different wavefunctions of the carriers in this high-density ND system. The PL quenching phenomena elucidated in this study will give us useful information about the dynamics of photo-excited carriers, such as carrier separation and transport, when we apply these Si NDs to solar cells and high-speed photonic devices.|$|R
40|$|The {{tremendous}} {{development of}} the internet or other wide band access technologies such as DSL, FTTH has driven the {{development of the}} high-capacity optical networks from research laboratories into commercial deployment such as Synchronous optical networks or Synchronous digital hierarchy. In the first generation, optics is used only in transmission, and all switching and other intelligent functions are handled in electronics. Now people are seeing the deployment of the 2 <b>nd</b> generation <b>optical</b> networks, where some of the routing, switching and intelligence are handled optically. In this network, data is carried from its source to its destination in optical form, without undergoing any optical-to-electrical conversion so that the electronic devices will not limit the speed. In this network, both of the two current primary techniques for data multiplexing i. e. wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and time-division multiplexing (TDM) are used including all optical devices such as wavelength converters, all optical switches, optical add/drop multiplexer, 2 R, 3 R and etc [...] //　This thesis introduces two novel devices for all optical processing by using multiple quantum well (MQW) electroabsorption modulators (EAM) for high-speed telecommunication: wavelength converters and all optical switches. The reasons why the EAM is used to replace the traditional semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) are short recovery time under reverse bias (possible to be < 10 ps), high stability, no amplified-spontaneous emission (ASE), and easy integration with other devices, especially, lasers. Moreover, we chose InGaAlAs as the core layer material in our devices due to its merits of large refractive index ratio between waveguide and cladding layer, large conduction band offset suitable for uncooled operation, and large spectral range. //　The proposed wavelength conversion is based on the optical nonlinear polarization rotation in an EAM. Nowadays, most of the EAM-based wavelength conversion is using cross-absorption modulation (XAM) due to its simple configuration. However, XAM suffers from the large input power, typically larger than 15 dBm. In order to reduce the input power, we investigated the cross-phase modulation (XPM) for TE mode and TM mode, and the polarization rotation. In the static wavelength conversion experiment, we demonstrated that the input powers for π phase shift are only 5 dBm for upward conversion (from 1555 nm to 1560 nm) and 8 dBm for downward conversion (from 1555 nm to 1550 nm), and the extinction ratios are 34 dB and 31 dB respectively. 10 Gb/s dynamic wavelength conversion has also been demonstrated. Further simulation shows that the narrowing of the quantum well and compressive strain of MQW enhance the polarization rotation, thus reducing the required input power for saturation state. Higher speed operation is also possible by using higher reverse and optimizing the RF response. //　For all optical switches, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) configuration with EAM on the MZI arms is proposed. On account of the low relaxation time of EAM, no push-pull operation is needed. Moreover, compared to SOA, EAM has no current injection, so lower heating and low power consumption can be achieved. //　The main challenge of our MZI-EAM device is the monolithic integration of the EAM and other passive waveguide. Due to large insertion loss of EAM and no gain devices in the whole structure, etch and regrowth method is chosen to reduce the total insertion loss by optimizing the active and passive regions individually. Till now, etch and regrowth technology has been well developed for InGaAsP material, but for Al-containing material, it still remains a challenge, especially for ex-situ cleaning procedure. The difficulty arises from the formation of stable Al-Oxides due to the often inevitable air-exposure of the InGaAlAs core layer during device processing, which degrades the crystal quality grown at the interface and causes large scattering loss. We optimized the growth conditions by MOVPE and processing procedures for both one-step regrowth and two-step regrowth and obtained good connection at the interface of the passive waveguide and active EAM region, with high coupling efficiency and low coupling loss (0. 21 dB/facet). //　Another big issue of the EAM-based all optical switch is the large insertion loss. This is mainly due to the large absorption of EAM and scattering in the waveguide. High mesa structure is superior for small size, but suffering from the significant scattering loss at the sidewall. Ridge structure has much lower loss, but has longer S-bend and multimode interferometer (MMI). Moreover, the doping profile in the cladding layer has also influence on the total loss. 報告番号: 甲 22283; 学位授与年月日: 2007 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 博工第 6488 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電子工学専...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{conjugated}} {{systems are}} attractive because of {{wide range of}} applications, which includes stimulated emission from -conjugated polymers, optical switches, organic solar cells and organic light emitting diodes, to name a few. They {{have the advantage of}} low cost, ease of processing and tunability of their linear and nonlinear optical properties by functionalization with donor or acceptor groups. In chapter 1, we provide an introduction to the π-conjugated systems and various interesting phenomena observed in these systems, This is followed by {{a brief description of the}} application of the above mentioned -conjugated systems for organic light emitting diodes, and organic photovoltaic cells. In the last section of this chapter, we give an introduction to magnetism due to π-electron systems. In chapter 2, we begin with energy band theory in one-dimension and its drawbacks. We introduce various model Hamiltonians which incorporate electron-electron inter-actions like Hubbard model, and Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model. We present numerical techniques like valence-bond (VB) and constant MS techniques that are used to exactly solve the above model Hamiltonian. This is followed by an introduction to density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) employed for the above model Hamiltonian for larger system in one-dimension and quasi-one-dimension. We give description of linear and nonlinear optical properties followed by the oriented gas model for ensemble of molecules. Various methods for computing polarizabilities and hyperpolarizibilities of molecules includes such as Finite-Field method, Sum-Over-State Method, and Correction Vector (CV) Methods are described in detail. In chapter 3, we look into fused azulene systems as a possible organic multiferroics. Azulene molecule with fused five and seven membered π-conjugated rings has a dipole moment, and the π-framework has geometric frustration. Hence in fused azulenes we can expect both ferroelectric and magnetic ground state. To explore this, we study low-lying correlated electronic states of fused azulenes using the long-range interacting PPP model and the finite DMRG method. The ground state is a singlet for oligomers up to 5 azulene units. For oligomers with more than 5 azulene units and up to 11 azulene units the oligomers have a triplet ground state. From the excitation gaps between the lowest MS = 0 state and the lowest states in MS= 1, 2, and 3 sectors we predict that the ground-state spin of the fused azulene increases with the number of azulene units. In the thermodynamic limit, we expect the fused azulene to be a ferromagnet. Charge density calculations show that the ground state of the system has ferroelectric alignment of the dipoles of the monomeric units. Thus, a fused azulene system could be the first example of an organic molecule which is both ferromagnetic and ferroelectric, in the ground state. In chapter 4, we study the linear and nonlinear optical properties of diradical systems. We have studied linear and non-linear optical properties of π-conjugated diradicals because they are expected to exhibit large non-linear responses. The system studied are oligomers of dicyclopenta-fused acenes (DPA) and the s-indaceno[1, 2, 3 -cd; 5, 6, 7 -c'd']diphenalene (IDPL) molecule. Spin-spin correlation functions within a correlated PPP model Hamiltonian, using exact diagonalization method, are used to characterize the diradical nature of DPA- 2 and similar calculations on Anthracene have been performed to contrast this with a singlet character. The diradical character of DPA- 2 is also manifest as low optical gap, low spin gap and large THG coefficients compared to Anthracene molecule. Larger DPA-k, k > 2, oligomers as well as the IDPL molecule have been studied within the DMRG technique. In the DPA- 4, we nd a very small spin gap (0. 04 eV), while in the oligomers with k > 4, we nd that the ground state is degenerate with the lowest triplet state. The energy of the second excited triplet state decreases with increasing size k and seems to saturate at ~ 0. 36 eV in the thermodynamic limit. The lowest optical gap in DPA- 4 is at 1. 94 eV and has large transition dipoles, while for DPA-k, 4 8 it increases up to the largest system with k= 20 for which we have computed the coe cient. The variation of the charge gap of DPA oligomer with the increase in system size is small and in the polymer limit the charge gap is 4 : 24 eV. For IDPL molecule spin gap is 0. 20 eV and next excited triplet state is at 1. 48 eV. Two lowest singlet states in B space are nearly degenerate and have large transition dipole moments. Optical gaps to the above states are 2. 20 eV and 2. 22 eV. Two-photon gap in this system is 1. 29 eV, hence this system is also non- uorescent. We calculated the dispersion of the major component of the THG coefficient, γxxxx, over a wide frequency range for this molecule, and we observe resonances corresponding to the 21 Ag and 11 Bu states. Extrapolated value of γxxxx at zero frequency is 15 : 58 x 106 a. u which is very large and the system does not have any donor or acceptor substituent groups. In chapter 5, we study absorption spectra and two photon absorption coefficient of expanded porphyrins (EPs). We nd that in the 4 n+ 2 EPs there are two prominent low-lying one-photon excitations while in 4 n systems there is only one such excitation. The two-photon gaps in both these types of systems are at energies close to the one-photon excitations. The spin gap in 4 n+ 2 EPs are very small although the spin- 1 / 2 Heisenberg calculations show that a pure spin system in this geometry will not have vanishing spin-gap. The charge density rearrangement in the one-photon excited state is most at the aza nitrogen site and at the meso carbon sites. In the two-photon states also the charge density rearrangement occurs mostly at the aza-ring sites. The bond order changes in these states is much more striking. In the one-photon state, the C-C bond length in the aza rings show a tendency to become uniform. Similar qualitative trend is also observed for the two-photon state. In chapter 6, we study linear and nonlinear optical properties of two push-pull polyenes stacked in head to head (HtH) and head to tail con gurations (HtT), at different stacking angles, exactly within the PPP model. Varying the stacking angle between polyenes, we <b>nd</b> that the <b>optical</b> gap varies slightly, but transition dipoles show large variation. The dominant component of first-order hyperpolarizability, βxxx for HtH and βyyy for HtT arrangement strongly depend on the distance between molecules. The βxxx for HtH configuration shows a maximum at a nonzero stacking angle, which varies with inter polyene distance. ZINDO study on two monomers, (4 -hydroxy- 40 -nitro-azobenzene) connected by a conjugated bridge shows that βav is more than twice the monomer value and with a red-shift in the optical gap. In chapter 7, we have calculated the shifts in optical gaps and band edges as a function of the distance between two monomers within a correlated PPP model Hamiltonian for various stacking geometries. We have used as model monomers, both unsubstituted polyenes and push-pull substituted polyenes. We have carried out calculations with and without inter-chain hopping between sites on different molecules. We note that in the absence of inter-chain hopping, the energy level shifts are almost independent of the distances between the chains in all stacking geometries. It is also interesting to note that only electron-electron interactions yield a blue shift in the optical gaps for parallel stacking, but red shift in the gap for all other stacking geometries. We note that most of the shift in the gap is due to shifts in the excited state energy and the ground-state energy remains almost the same. With interchain transfer the shift in the optical gap increases with decrease in the interchain distance. We observe red-shifts in parallel stacking geometry when inter-chain electron hopping is turned on, at small interchain separations. In general interchain hopping increases significantly the red shift in the optical gaps for all geometries. Even for push-pull polyenes of | e| = 2. 0 eV, we observe the same trend in the shift in the optical gap for various stacking geometries. In this case the shift in optical gap is an order of magnitude higher when interchain hopping is turned on compared to that in the absence of interchain hopping. We find that the optical gap shifts are largest for the parallel stacking geometry, and it also shows stronger distance dependence. This is in close conformity with experimental observation of red-shift in absorption maxima when hydrostatic pressure is applied on the system. The shift in the HOMO (LUMO) level is small in the absence of t?, and the largest shift is in the case of parallel stacking compared to other stacking geometries. The distance dependence of the HOMO shifts is also rather weak. When t? is turned on, the level shifts become large by a factor of five or more. When we have push-pull groups electron-hole symmetry is broken and the shift is different for the HOMO and the LUMO level. Depending upon stacking geometry, the HOMO shifts vary from 0 : 1 ~ eV to 0. 3 eV, which is larger than the shifts observed in unsubstituted polyenes. This large shift in the LUMO reduces the efficiency of exciton dissociation...|$|R
