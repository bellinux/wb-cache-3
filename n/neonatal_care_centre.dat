40|$|Objective. Over {{the past}} decade, {{multiple}} factors {{have changed the}} pattern of neonatal surgical emergencies. An increase in prenatal screenings {{and the development of}} <b>neonatal</b> tertiary <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> have changed the clinical approach to these kids. Materials and methods. Between 1995 to 2011 were retrospectively reviewed 34 patients with diagnosis of uncommon rare neonatal surgical emergencies at our institute. We analyzed: sex, gestational age, weight at birth, primary pathology, prenatal diagnosis, associated anomalies, age and weight at surgery, clinical presentation, start of oral feeding and hospitalization. The follow-up was performed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Results. There were 21 male and 13 female. The gestational age ranged between 28 and 36 weeks. The weight at birth ranged between 700 and 1400 grams. Oral feeding was started between 4 th and 10 th postoperative day. The average hospitalization was about 70. 47 days. To date, all patients have finished the followup. They are healthy. Conclusion. The outcome of the patients with uncommon surgical emergencies is different based on the etiology. Overall survival is generally good but is influenced by the associated anomalies...|$|R

40|$|Sepsis is an {{important}} cause of mortality in neonates Umbilicus is a common site for sepsis and requires utmost care {{in order to prevent}} probable risks of infection. There lies a difference in the method of cord cutting and caring the remaining stump of cord which varies from region to region based on the socio-cultural background. 1 However, proper umbilicus care is very important to prevent chances of risk and infections. Different beliefs in different communities regarding cord care and handling of umbilicus exposes a newly born child to some potential dangerous consequences and risk for developing sepsis. A neonate presented to the Paediatric Ward of Kuwait Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, KPK with an umbilicus wrapped. The string was tied around his neck (refer to Figure 1) to apparently help in falling off the cord quickly as the baby moves his head. Handling umbilicus in such an unhygienic way is dangerous and can lead to bacterial infection and sepsis 2, {{as was the case in}} this baby. It was really interesting to find that a similar practice also exist in Africa where the cord is held with string and then tied around the baby’s neck exclusively of male gender as the perception is that if the cord touches the genitalia then it will later cause sterility. 3 It is therefore necessary to educate the parents of neonate to observe a proper protocol for the care of cord and umbilicus. This will not only help in minimizing risk of sepsis but also it will contribute in reducing unnecessary burden on <b>neonatal</b> health <b>care</b> <b>centres</b> and thus reducing yearly economic burden.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the resources for <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> in Taiwan, a questionnaire was sent out by the Premature Baby Foundation of the Republic of China to affiliated hospitals; 62 hospitals responded. The collected data included the equipment and personnel available for <b>neonatal</b> <b>care,</b> <b>neonatal</b> volume, and neonatal transfer rate, from January 1, 1997 to June 30, 1998. The results of our study revealed {{that the number of}} beds in <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> units (NI-CUs), the equipment for <b>neonatal</b> <b>care,</b> and the neonatologist-to-bed ratios in the NICUs achieved the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics. But the mortality rate is still higher in Taiwan than in other developed countries. This might be related to the uneven distribution and underutilization of <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> resources. The beds in NICUs were centered around urban centers such as Taipei, Taichung, and Tainan. Remote areas in western Taiwan, such as in Nantou, Hsinchu, Miaoli, and Yunlin Counties, and on the east coast lacked sufficient <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> resources. In addition, the regionalization of perinatal care has not been fully implemented at present in Taiwan. Maternal referral rates are low, and neonatal transport rates for very low birth weight and extremely low birth weight babies are still high in Taiwan. From the results of our study, it is strongly recommended that regionalization of <b>neonatal</b> <b>care,</b> and educa-tion on the benefits of prenatal referral for high-risk pregnancies be established in Taiwan. To improve <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> and decrease <b>neonatal</b> mortality, we should encourage young neonatologists to accept assignments in rural <b>neonatal</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R

40|$|Neonatal {{mortality}} in Sudan {{is estimated at}} (31 per 1 000). The high figure is attributed to poor <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> resources, and shortage of staff trained in <b>neonatal</b> <b>care.</b> Midwives are the first line staff to deal with neonates requiring urgent help. <b>Neonatal</b> <b>care</b> training is deficient in midwifery schools. Also there is lack of in-service training m neonatal cai'e for hospital midwives. We established a two days course in March 2007 in Khartoum named (<b>Neonatal</b> <b>care</b> and infection prevention). This has targeted Hospital midwives in its first phase. Ten courses were held between March 2007 and June 2009. Five of these were held in Khartoum, whereas five were organized in the districts in the White Nile (Kosti), The Blue Nile (Sinja), Algazeera (Almanagil), Gedarif and Kassala. The courses compnse lectures on common neonatal problems, as well as practicals on neonatal resuscitation, neonatal examination and infection prevention. 240 midwives have been trained so far. Of these, 50 candidates have been selected to become future trainers in their own hospitals. They attended a Training of the Trainers course in December 2008. We conclude that more <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> courses are required to cover all midwives involved in delivery and care of the newborn. We believe that improving <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> training for midwives, as well as applying scientific measures at infection prevention, will contribute to reduction of neonatal mortality and morbidity...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aims of {{this study}} were to assess clinicians’ views and {{experiences}} of providing immediate <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> at birth beside the mother, and of using a mobile trolley designed to facilitate this bedside care. Design: Qualitative interview study with semistructured interviews. Results: The results were analysed using thematic analysis. Setting: A large UK maternity unit. Participants: Clinicians (n= 20) from a range of disciplines who were present when the trolley was used to provide <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> at birth at the bedside. Five clinicians provided/observed advanced resuscitation by the bedside. Results: Five themes were identified: (1) Parents’ involvement, which included ‘Contact and involvement’, ‘Positive emotions for parents’ and ‘Staff communication’; (2) Reservations about <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> at birth beside the mother, which included ‘Impact on clinicians’ and ‘Impact on parents’; (3) Practical challenges in providing <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> at the bedside, which included ‘Cord length’ and ‘Caesarean section’; (4) Comparison of the trolley with usual resuscitation equipment and (5) Training and integration of bedside care into clinical routine, which included ‘Teething problems’ and ‘Training’. Conclusions: Overall, most clinicians were positive about providing immediate <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> at the maternal bedside, particularly in terms of the clinicians’ perceptions of the parents’ experience. Clinicians also perceived that their close proximity to parents improved communication. However, there was some concern about performing more intensive interventions in front of parents.

40|$|Objective To {{analyze the}} risk of {{admission}} to <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> for newborns of low-risk nullipara and its variation with level of care of the maternity unit. Study design The sample included infants born to low-risk nulliparas from the PREMODA study of 138 French maternity units (n = 3652). Medical records of children admitted to <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> were reviewed to determine the reasons for admission and the severity of morbidity. The risk factors associated with admission to <b>neonatal</b> <b>care,</b> including maternal, infant and delivery unit characteristics, were studied by univariable analysis, followed by a multivariable analysis using a multilevel logistic model. Results The newborns of 3. 5 % (n = 129) of the nulliparous mothers at low risk were admitted to <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> at birth. The two principal reasons were infections (57 %) and respiratory diseases (19 %). Babies born in level 2 maternity units were {{twice as likely to}} be admitted to <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> as those born in level 1 units (ORa = 2. 0 [1. 1 – 3. 7]) and those born in level 3 units, 1. 5 times more often, although this was not statistically significant (ORa = 1. 5 [0. 8 – 2. 8]). Babies admitted to <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> after delivery in level 1 had more severe morbidity (n = 4, 26. 7 %) than those admitted from level 2 (n = 4, 5. 7 %) or level 3 (n = 3, 6. 8 %) facilities (p = 0. 046). Conclusion In low-risk populations, the level of care could have an influence on the decision to admit babies to <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> at birth.
