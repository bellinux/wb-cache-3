40|$|The {{power of}} the media lies {{in its ability to}} construct, change <b>and</b> recycle the <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> the signs that are {{foundational}} to our culture. This paper examines the <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> signs that represent men and in that representing, also stereotype, enclose and misrepresent men. Because many <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> images of men are negative, then men and women, and the institutions of society and culture such as the law and the legislature, take for granted these negative images <b>and</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> build their cultural and legal frameworks based on negative images <b>and</b> <b>narratives.</b> Through arguing that these representations are generally inaccurate, this paper calls for a closer examination of the <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> images that represent men, an acknowledgment of the {{power of the}}se images <b>and</b> <b>narratives</b> in the cultural life of Western countries. It argues for a reassessment of the institutional structures that further misrepresent men and place men in disadvantaged positions when they come in contact with these institutional structures...|$|R

5|$|As Evolve is multiplayer-focused, {{the design}} team put less time and focus into {{developing}} Evolves <b>narrative</b> <b>and</b> campaign. Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the design team {{thought that it}} would negatively impact on the conversations between players. However, the story and narrative became more significant in the single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve. Playing as different characters would also lead to different conversations and dialogues between characters.|$|E

We propose the use of leaderboards, <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> deadlines as motivation strategies to persuade user participation in the conversational modeling for virtual humans. We evaluate the applicabil-ity of leaderboards, <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> deadlines through a user study conducted with medical students (n= 20) for modeling the conversational corpus of a vir-tual patient character. Leaderboards, <b>narratives</b> <b>and</b> deadlines were observed to be effective in improving user participation. Incorporating these strategies had the additional effect of making user responses less reflective of real world con-versations...|$|R
