40|$|Following the {{intravenous}} injection of concentrated, antipneumococcus horse serum, there frequently occurs a systemic reaction of varying intensity and widespread effects. This comes on usually in from 30 to 60 {{minutes after the}} injection and begins almost always with a chill which is accompanied and followed by an elevation of temperature. The temperature rise covers {{a period of several}} hours, This reaction is quite distinct from an immediate anaphylactic effect and from delayed serum sickness. It is not peculiar to antipneumococcus serum since a similar reaction may occur from {{intravenous injection}} of whole blood, vaccines, various proteins and split protein products, <b>nucleins,</b> and such substances as salt, sugar, colloidal metals and even distilled water (1). The nature of the substance producing the reaction is not known, nor is the mechanism through which the effects are brought about, understood.

50|$|Miescher {{isolated}} various phosphate-rich chemicals, {{which he}} called <b>nuclein</b> (now nucleic acids), from the nuclei of white blood cells in 1869 in Felix Hoppe-Seyler's laboratory at the University of Tübingen, Germany, {{paving the way for}} the identification of DNA as the carrier of inheritance. The significance of the discovery, first published in 1871, was not at first apparent, and it was Albrecht Kossel who made the initial inquiries into its chemical structure. Later, Friedrich Miescher raised the idea that the nucleic acids could be involved in heredity.|$|E
50|$|Miescher devised {{different}} salt solutions, eventually producing {{one with}} sodium sulfate. The cells were filtered. Since centrifuges {{were not available}} at the time, the cells were allowed to settle {{to the bottom of}} a beaker. He then tried to isolate the nuclei free of cytoplasm. He subjected the purified nuclei to an alkaline extraction followed by acidification, resulting in the formation of a precipitate that Miescher called <b>nuclein</b> (now known as DNA). He found that this contained phosphorus and nitrogen, but not sulfur. The discovery was so unlike anything else at the time that Hoppe-Seyler repeated all Miescher's research himself before publishing it in his journal. Miescher then went on to study physiology at Leipzig in the laboratory of Carl Ludwig for a year before being appointed professor of physiology.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, {{he worked}} with Martin Freund at Goethe University of Frankfurt and with Franz Hofmeister in Strasbourg. From 1897 to 1898, he served as an {{assistant}} to Carl von Noorden, clinician at the City Hospital in Frankfurt. Soon, however, after seeing the high mortality in countless cases of far-advanced tuberculosis and pneumonia, left without any treatment because of lack of therapy, he decided to drop his intention to become a clinician and instead to carry out research in basic medical science, in particular pharmacology. In 1898, he became an assistant of Professor Hans Horst Meyer, the renowned pharmacologist at the University of Marburg. During his first years in Marburg, Loewi's studies were in the field of metabolism. As a result of his work on the action of phlorhizin, a glucoside provoking glycosuria, and another one on <b>nuclein</b> metabolism in man, he was appointed «Privatdozent» (Lecturer) in 1900. Two years later he published his paper «Über Eiweisssynthese im Tierkörper» (On protein synthesis in the animal body), proving that animals are able to rebuild their proteins from their degradation products, the amino acids - an essential discovery with regard to nutrition.|$|E
40|$|Nucleic acids are {{the central}} {{molecules}} in transmission, expression and conservation of genetic information. Nucleic acids were first discovered by Friedrich Miescher in 1871. This Swiss physician and biologist isolated various phosphate-rich chemicals, {{which he called}} <b>nuclein</b> (now nucleic acids), from the nucleic acids of white blood cells in 1869. After Miescher’s initial description in 1871, other scientists also started investigations into <b>nuclein.</b> However, for long after Miescher’s death, <b>nuclein</b> still received comparatively little attention. The role of DNA as the carrier of genetic information has been amply demonstrated beginning with the classic experiments of Avery 1 and Hershey and Chase 2. Identifying DNA as the code of life was a remarkable discovery. However, uncovering the structure of DNA {{would prove to be}} the key to understand the role it plays in the formation of life. This structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest. The classic example of how biological functions follow from biomolecular structures comes from the elucidation of the structure of DNA as a double helix by Watson and Crick 3 using the X-ray fiber diffraction patterns generated by Franklin, Wilkins, and their associates. 4, 5 “We wish to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ” –this was the opening remark in the paper published in the Nature magazine by Watson and Crick announcing discovery of the structure of DNA in the year 1953.

Then they were analyzed for their P content. At the same time, their phosphorous compounds were fractionated and measured the radioactivity. The concentration of P. 2 ̆ 2 was {{highest in the}} boot leaf, which was the newest, and that coincided with Bidduiph 2 ̆ 7 s results. P 2 ̆ 2 in the leaf, then, gradually translocated into the ear and accumulated. Total P as phosphatide and <b>nuclein</b> decreased in the leaf and stem during this period, but P 2 ̆ 2 as these forms increased in every parts of plants.

40|$|Thus, our {{conclusions}} harmonize {{with those}} of Brugsch and Schittenhelm {{in so far as}} they are concerned with the <b>nuclein</b> metabolism. They add, however, the observation that the elimination of nitrogenous substances of protein origin has a protracted character, and that the oxidation of as simple a substance as asparagin proceeds at a subnormal rate. The most striking peculiarity observed in our patient was the very imperfect elimination of ingested urea when the patient was placed on a diet containing only six grams of nitrogen per day, and a much more complete elimination when the diet contained thirteen grams of nitrogen...|$|E

40|$|The most marked {{chemical}} {{changes in}} a disintegrating spleen are noticed during the period when karyorrhexis and karyolysis are the characteristic features. When pyknosis alone is prominent {{almost all of the}} several constituents are in the coagulable or precipitable fraction, just as they are in the original normal tissue. After karyolysis is practically complete the coagulable and precipitable elements of the tissue still gradually decrease in amount, but the rate is far below that occurring during karyorrhexis and karyolysis. Moreover, even when microscopical nuclear disintegration is practically at an end, the chemical process of disintegration is still going on, but very slowly. Finally, when nuclear structures can no longer be seen in the spleen, about 72 per cent. of the <b>nuclein</b> nitrogen, about 50 per cent. of the original insoluble phosphorus, and 70 per cent. of the original insoluble nitrogen, are still in the insoluble form (precipitable and coagulable by alcohol), while about two thirds of the phosphatid phosphorus remains in complex organic combinations...|$|E
40|$|Definite {{hyperplasia}} {{of cells}} {{occurs in the}} skin lesions of the infectious myxoma of rabbits, more visible in such stages in which the intercellular basophilic substance is rather scanty (fig. 2). The increase in number of cells {{is the result of}} simplified forms of mitosis (modified type of mitosis, pseudoamitosis) which might readily be mistaken for amitosis in their final stages. Budding (figs. 20, 28, 29, 30) as well as constriction of the nucleus (figs. 18, 31, 32), and the formation of giant-cells (figs. 33, 34) are not rare. During the entire process the nuclear membrane does not desintegrate as in typical mitosis. Division of the cytoplasm following division of the nucleus has been demonstrated (fig. 17). Typical mitosis is practically absent. The cells which undergo hyperplasia present remarkable changes in their dimension, shape, and structure. The nucleus and cell-body are considerably enlarged (figs. 6, 7, 8). The shape of the nucleus is modified (figs. 8, 10, 15). Hypertrophy of <b>nuclein,</b> either as an intranuclear network (spireme?, figs. 9, 23), or in the form conspicuous, deeply staining masses which appear not to be homogeneous but to be composed of small particles closely clumped ("mulberries"?, figs. 12, 13, 14, 25, 26) occurs in most cells. While some of these pictures are probably related to necrosis of the cells as started by most of the previous workers, it is lekely that some of them may represent developmental stages of the modified mitosis (pseudoamitosis) here reported. In fact, fine cytological details not ordinarily preserved in necrotic cells (figs. 35, 36, 37) may be demonstrated in the socalled myxoma-cells subtted to approved cytological methods of study (fixation in B- 15 and P. F. A. - 3, staining in iron-hematoxylin) ...|$|E
40|$|It {{was known}} for many years that living things inherit traits from their parents. These {{observations}} led to agriculture, breeding and cultivation of plants of desirable characteristics. Firming up the details took quite some time and researchers did not understand exactly how traits were passed {{to the next generation}} until the middle of the twentieth century. Now it is clear that genes carry our traits through generations and that genes are made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The history of DNA research began with Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss biologist, who in 1868 detected a phosphorus-containing substance from the nuclei of pus cells obtained from discarded surgical bandages. He named it ‘nuclein’ consisting of an acidic portion which we know today as DNA. Even though Miescher and many others following him suspected that <b>nuclein</b> might {{play a key role in}} cell inheritance, but their lack of chemical diversity compared to proteins ruled out such a possibility. But in 1943 Avery and his colleagues at the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research used bacteria to provide the first evidence that DNA is the bearer of genetic information. In 1952 Hershey and Chase showed that it is the DNA part of the T 2 viral particle furnishing the genetic information for the replication of the virus. By 1952, much was known about DNA as the sole substance capable of storing practically all the information needed to create a living being. What was not yet known was how the elusive DNA looked like, or the mechanism by which genetic information is passed on to the next generation remained the single greatest unanswered question in biology till 1953. It was in that year that James Watson, an American geneticist, and Francis Crick, an English physicist worked at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge and proposed a double helical structure for DNA. The sentence ‘This structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest’ may be one of science’s most famous understatements that paved the way for a scientific breakthrough in the name of DNA [1]. This was the culmination of a brilliant piece of work and a discovery that has proven to be the key to molecular biology and modern biotechnology. Using information derived from a number of other scientific works like X-ray fibre diffraction patterns generated by Rosalind Franklin, Maurice Wilkins, and their associates at the Wheatstone Physics Laboratory, King’s College [2, 3] and the chemical evidence on base complementarity of Chargaff (1950), Watson and Crick were able to intelligently assemble the information like pieces of a puzzle to produce their model of the structure of DNA...|$|E
40|$|Deoxyribonucleic acid, {{generally}} {{referred to}} as DNA by its acronym, {{is the basis of}} life, which contains the information for the development and functioning of all the living organisms. The DNA research began in 1868, when Swiss physiological chemist Friedrich Miescher first identified what he called “nuclein” inside the nuclei of human white blood cells. In 1889, R. Altmann separated <b>nuclein</b> from protein and because of its acidic character he named it nucleic acid. Phoebus Levene identified the components of DNA and showed that they were linked in the order phosphate- sugar-base to form units which he referred as nucleotide and suggested that the DNA molecule consisted of a string of nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups, which is the ‘backbone’ of the molecule. The role of DNA in heredity was recognized in 1944, when Avery and co-workers published their famous result that DNA and not proteins were the carriers of genetic information (Avery et al., 1944). The complementary base-pair rule was found by Chargaff in 1950 (Chargaff et al., 1950). A milestone in DNA research was the double helix structure which was proposed by Watson and Crick in 1953 based upon the X-ray fiber diffraction data from fibres of DNA obtained by Rosalind Franklin (Watson and Crick, 1953). From the double helical structure, it was immediately obvious how information could pass {{from one generation to the}} next by synthesis of DNA complementary strands from parent strands. In 1962 they received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery along with the crystallographer Maurice Wilkins. The first published account of the directed chemical synthesis of an oligonucleotide occurred in 1955 when Michelson and Todd reported the preparation of a dithymidinyl nucleotide (Michelson and Todd, 1955). In the late 1950 ’s Khorana and his group were able to synthesize oligoribonucleotides that were used to confirm the Genetic Code. In 1968, Khorana received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their interpretation of the genetic code and its function in protein synthesis. Khorana’s method was revolutionary at the time and produced a truly remarkable feat: the synthesis of an active 72 -mer tRNA molecule, which was published in Nature (Agarwal et al., 1970). However, it was not until the late 1970 ’s that the development of DNA research became explosive, when synthetic DNA fragments became commercially available. Pohl and Jovin first observed the salt-induced cooperative conformational changes of the synthetic DNA poly(dG-dC). poly(dG-dC) duplex, from a right-handed helix to left handed helix from the circular dichroism study (Pohl and Jovin, 1972) ...|$|E
