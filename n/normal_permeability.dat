30|$|Introduction: The {{bacterial}} lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin is a {{major component}} of the outer membrane of all Gram-negative bacteria. LPS {{plays an important role in}} the <b>normal</b> physiology, <b>permeability</b> and fluidity of the bacterial outer cell wall. Endotoxaemia is associated with infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, but can occurs in absence of it. In sepsis, some of the protective mechanisms of gut barrier are disrupted and subsequently, bacterial products, like endotoxin, may cross the gut mucosa and spread to the mesenteric lymph nodes or more distant organs. This phenomenon is known as bacterial translocation (BT).|$|R

40|$|Glomerular permselectivity is {{dependent}} on adequate serum concentrations of orosomucoid. Orosomucoid, or α 1 -acid glycoprotein, a serum protein known to be an “acute phase reactant” has recently {{been shown to be}} needed for the maintenance of <b>normal</b> capillary <b>permeability</b> in skeletal muscle and mesentery. Therefore, we were interested in studying whether the glomerular capillary wall is affected by orosomucoid as well. For this purpose, left and right kidneys from nine rats (group A) were isolated and perfused in situ and in parallel using separate solutions of human albumin (1. 8 % in Tyrode), differing in their content of orosomucoid, one containing 0. 21 g/liter, the other less than 0. 005 g/liter. The temperature was kept at 8 °C in order to minimize tubular reabsorption of fluid and albumin. The two kidneys showed identical and stable vascular resistances during the experiments. Also the glomerular filtration rates (GFR) were stable between 30 and 33 ml/min/ 100 g kidney. Initially, the two kidneys showed similar fractional albumin clearance (Θ) values of approximately 0. 003. However, in the “absence” of orosomucoid Θ increased to become four- to fivefold higher in the test kidney than in the control kidney {{at the end of the}} 1 ½ hour experiment. This difference was observed in all rats, suggesting that orosomucoid is needed also for the maintenance of the glomerular permselectivity. In a separate group of eight animals (group B), orosomucoid-containing albumin solutions were used in parallel with horse serum solutions to perfuse the two kidneys of each rat, at 8 °C. The same protocol as above was used, but no differences could be observed between the two perfusates, indicating that serum proteins other than albumin and orosomucoid are less important for the maintenance of <b>normal</b> capillary <b>permeability.</b> Orosomucoid probably exerts its action on the capillary wall by interacting with the capillary charge barrier. The results indicate that the glomerular barrier has major similarities with that of other capillary beds. Furthermore, the notion that the glomerular permselectivity can be modulated by a serum protein may have pathophysiological implications...|$|R

To date, tissue engineering efforts have not replicated normal STZ function in cartilage repairs.

Models were developed by incrementally adding improvements which culminated in contact loading of curved models by permeable and impermeable rigid surfaces and a normal cartilage layer. In the <b>normal</b> STZ, <b>permeability</b> was strain-dependent on volumetric strain; tension-compression nonlinearity modeled collagen behavior. Nonlinear geometry accounted for finite deformation. Results showed that STZ properties of sufficient quality maybe critical for the survival of transplanted constructs in vivo.

This observation is of a crucial importance because most of the studies reported in literature and devoted to penetration of fluorescent NPs into living cells are carried out on proliferating cells, suggesting that they have been trypsinized for a short time before the NP exposure. Our observation correlates well to the fact that trypsin is known to alter the cell plasma membrane. Indeed, cell transient increase during the rounding up, possibly due to the detachment of the ‘feet’ holding the cells onto the substrate, has been reported[13].

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{pathogenicity}} of late respiratory infections with {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) in the critically ill is unclear. METHODS: In four critically ill patients with persistent pulmonary infiltrates of unknown origin and isolation of HSV- 1 from tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, at 7 (1 - 11) days after start of mechanical ventilatory support, a pulmonary leak index (PLI) for 67 Gallium (67 Ga) -transferrin (upper limit of normal 14. 1 x 10 (- 3) /min) was measured.

The probe, 51 Cr-EDTA, was injected into ligated loops of jejunum in vivo and recovery of radioactivity was measured in urine, kidney, and intact loop at five hours. Urinary recovery was significantly increased during the early (day 7) and acute (day 10) stages of the infection compared with values in control rats but subsequently returned to normal. Urinary clearance of the probe after iv injection was unaltered during infection. Villus atrophy occurred only at the stage, whereas crypt hyperplasia was evident at both the early and acute stages.

40|$|Oblique dextral motion on {{the central}} Alpine Fault in the last circa 5 Ma has exhumed garnet-oligoclase facies mylonitic fault rocks from ∼ 35 km depth. During exhumation, deformation, {{accompanied}} by fluid infiltration, has generated complex lithological variations in fault-related rocks retrieved during Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP- 1) drilling at Gaunt Creek, South Island, New Zealand. Lithological, geochemical, and mineralogical results reveal that the fault comprises a core of highly comminuted cataclasites and fault gouges bounded by a damage zone containing cataclasites, protocataclasites, and fractured mylonites. The fault core-alteration zone extends ∼ 20 – 30 m from the principal slip zone (PSZ) and is characterized by alteration of primary phases to phyllosilicate minerals. Alteration associated with distinct mineral phases occurred proximal the brittle-to-plastic transition (T[*]≤[*] 300 – 400 °C, 6 – 10 km depth) and at shallow depths (T[*]=[*] 20 – 150 °C, 0 – 3 km depth).

Methods: We studied 12 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease who had been in remission for at least 3 months and had increased intestinal permeability on two separate occasions within the last 2 months. Patients received oral zinc sulfate supplements (110 mg three times a day) for 8 weeks and were followed-up for 12 months thereafter to monitor relapses. Results: We found that the lactulose/mannitol ratio was significantly higher before supplementation than after (0. 041 +/- 0. 003 versus 0. 026 +/- 0. 005). During follow-up, 10 patients had <b>normal</b> intestinal <b>permeability</b> and did not relapse; of the remaining two who had increased intestinal permeability, one relapsed.

Axonal conduction persisted following treatment with the glial toxin. A consistent feature of glial damage and repair was the prominent involvement of granule-containing cells. These cells (which were never seen in control cords) shared a number of cytological features with hemocytes that were seen adhering to and penetrating the neural lamella, {{in the early stages}} of glial damage. The granule-containing cells appear to serve dual functions: phagocytosis and structural repair. After 48 hr, granule-containing cells, or their processes, formed layers at the periphery of the connectives.

40|$|To {{assess the}} ion {{transport}} {{mechanism by which}} cholera causes the small bowel to secrete, ion transport rates and electrical potential difference (PD) were determined simultaneously in the normal and choleragen-treated dog ileum in vivo. The results indicate that, during cholera, HCO 3 is actively secreted (i. e., against both an electrical and a concentration gradient); Cl is also actively secreted, against a modest electrochemical gradient. Electrogenic pumping of {{one or both of}} these anions is probably responsible for an observed PD change of approximately 13 mv (lumen negative). Na secretion can be accounted for entirely by passive ion movement. K secretion can be partly explained by passive diffusion secondary to the negative intraluminal PD; however, its concentration in the secreted fluid is two to three times higher than expected on the basis of passive forces, suggesting a component of active K secretion. The PD response of the choleragen-treated ileum is normal in response to glucose, but there was no PD response to saline-free mannitol perfusion.

The effects of L. paracasei were reported superior {{to those of the}} other two [53]. A study, which compared the ability of 50 different LAB to control 23 different pathogenic Clostridium difficile found more than half (27 / 50) totally ineffective, (18 / 50) antagonistic to some, but only five strains effective against all: two strains of Lb paracasei s. paracasei and five strains of Lp plantarum[54].

40|$|AbstractThe biphasic {{characteristics}} of articular cartilage {{are known to}} play important roles in cartilage lubrication. However, it is still difficult to biotribologically explain the extremely low friction coefficient observed in articular cartilage. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} the surface layer of articular cartilage includes tangentailly-aligned dense collagen fibers while permeability of articular cartilage in tangential direction is dramatically reduced in response to compressive strain. Therefore, we hypothesized that the anisotropic structure and property in articular cartilage surface improve the lubrication and frictional properties. A fiber–reinforced poroelastic biphasic model was developed in Abaqus to determine the effect of low tangential permeability on the frictional property of articular cartilage. In the model, the tangential permeability in the superficial layer of 100 μm in thickness was reduced to 1 / 10 as compared with <b>normal</b> <b>permeability.</b> Results revealed that the permeability-reduced superficial layer {{plays an important role in}} decreasing friction coefficient in articular cartilage and the role is more significant in slower friction including the start-up friction.

We used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an animal model to evaluate the effect of a hydroxamate matrix metalloprotease inhibitor (GM 6001) on inflammatory demyelination. A single dose of the inhibitor, given intraperitoneally, provided sufficient levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of animals with EAE to induce at least a partial inhibition of the gelatinase activity in the cerebrospinal fluid. When administered daily either from the time of disease induction or from the onset of clinical signs, GM 6001 suppressed the development or reversed clinical EAE in a dose-dependent way, respectively. Animals returned to the same clinical course as the nontreated group after cessation of treatment. Animals treated from the onset of clinical signs had <b>normal</b> <b>permeability</b> of the blood-brain barrier, compared with the enhanced permeability in nontreated animals. These results indicate that matrix metalloprotease inhibition can reverse ongoing EAE. This effect appears to be mediated mainly through restoration of the damaged blood-brain barrier in the inflammatory phase of the disease, since, the degree of demyelination and inflammation did not differ between the treatment groups...|$|E

Platelet-type 12 -lipoxygenase in wild-type mice was localized to the stratum granulosum by immunohistochemical analysis. Platelet-type 12 -lipoxygenase-deficient mice lacked immunodetectable platelet-type 12 -lipoxygenase in platelets and epidermis, appeared grossly normal, and exhibited an increase in basal transepidermal water loss without alteration in basal mitotic activity. Water loss and mitotic activity in mice with an acetone-disrupted membrane barrier were normal. No defect in ultrastructural properties or content of major fatty acids in dorsal skin or ear inflammation response was apparent in platelet-type 12 -lipoxygenase-deficient mice.

Lacteals and submucosal lymphatic capillaries of the intestine were also dilated, while mesenteric collecting lymphatics failed to properly transport chyle after an acute Western Diet, culminating in chronic failure of Calcrl(fl/fl) /CAGGCre-ER™ mice to gain weight. Dermal lymphatic capillaries were also dilated and chronic edema challenge confirmed significant and prolonged dermal lymphatic insufficiency. In vivo and in vitro imaging of lymphatics with either genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of AM signaling revealed markedly disorganized lymphatic junctional proteins ZO- 1 and VE-cadherin. The maintenance of AM signaling during adulthood is required for preserving <b>normal</b> lymphatic <b>permeability</b> and function. Collectively, these studies reveal a spectrum of lymphatic defects in adult Calcrl(fl/fl) /CAGGCre-ER™ mice that closely recapitulate the clinical symptoms of patients with corneal, intestinal and peripheral lymphangiectasia...|$|R
40|$|Small {{intestinal}} morphology {{and function}} were assessed in 82 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, 51 {{of whom were}} taking a normal diet and 31 a gluten free diet. Methods used were histopathological evaluation of jejunal mucosal biopsy specimens, quantitation of intraepithelial lymphocytes, cellobiose/mannitol permeability test, tissue disaccharidase values, serum antigliadin antibodies, and formal assessment of dietary gluten content by a dietician. There was no correlation between dietary gluten intake {{and the degree of}} enteropathy in the 51 patients taking a normal diet, whereas biopsy specimens were normal in 24 of the 31 patients on a gluten free diet, all previously having been abnormal. Eighteen patients on gluten containing diets had normal jejunal histology and in seven of these all tests of small intestinal morphology and function were entirely <b>normal.</b> Intestinal <b>permeability</b> was abnormal and serum antigliadin antibodies were present in most patients with enteropathy. Studies of acid secretion in seven patients showed that hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria did not lead to abnormal permeability in the absence of enteropathy. This study shows that a combination of objective tests of small intestinal architecture and function will detect abnormalities in most dermatitis herpetiformis patients, including some with histologically normal jejunal biopsy specimens. Nevertheless there is a small group in whom all conventional intestinal investigations are entirely normal...|$|R
