50|$|One way {{to control}} neuroinflammation is to inhibit {{microglia}}l activation. Studies on microglia have shown that they are activated by diverse stimuli but they are dependent on activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Previous approaches to down-regulate activated microglia focused on immunosuppressants. Recently, minocycline (a tetracycline derivative) has shown down-regulation of microglial MAPK. Another promising treatment is CPI-1189, which induces cell death in a TNF α-inhibiting compound that also down-regulates MAPK. Recent study shows that <b>nicergoline</b> (Sermion) suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines and superoxide anion by activated microglia. Microglial activation can be inhibited by MIF (microglia/macrophage inhibitory factor, tuftsin fragment 1-3, Thr-Lys-Pro).

40|$|<b>Nicergoline,</b> a drug {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, was tested for its ability to protect neurons against beta-amyloid toxicity. Pure cultures of rat cortical neurons were challenged with a toxic fragment of beta-amyloid peptide (betaAP(25 - 35)) and toxicity was assessed after 24 h. Micromolar concentrations of <b>nicergoline</b> or its metabolite, MDL, attenuated betaAP(25 - 35) -induced neuronal death, whereas MMDL (another metabolite of <b>nicergoline),</b> the alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin, or the serotonin 5 HT- 2 receptor antagonist, methysergide, were inactive. <b>Nicergoline</b> increased the basal levels of Bcl- 2 and reduced the increase in Bax levels induced by beta-amyloid, indicating that the drug inhibits the execution of an apoptotic program in cortical neurons. In mixed cultures of rat cortical cells containing both neurons and astrocytes, <b>nicergoline</b> and MDL were more efficacious than in pure neuronal cultures in reducing beta-amyloid neurotoxicity.

40|$|The ergot {{alkaloid}} derivative <b>nicergoline</b> became clinically available about 35 {{years ago}} in the 1970 s. <b>Nicergoline</b> has a broad spectrum of action: (i) as an al-adrenoceptor antagonist, it induces vasodilation and increases arterial blood flow; (ii) it enhances cholinergic and catecholaminergic neurotransmitter function; (iii) it inhibits platelet aggregation; (iv) it promotes metabolic activity, resulting in increased utilization of oxygen and glucose; and (v) it has neurotrophic and antioxidant properties. Acting on several basic pathophysiological mechanisms, <b>nicergoline</b> has therapeutic potential in a number of disorders. This article provides an overview of the published clinical evidence relating to the efficacy and safety of <b>nicergoline</b> (30 mg twice daily) in the treatment of dementia (including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia) and vascular and balance disorders. For dementia of different aetiologies, the therapeutic benefit of <b>nicergoline</b> has been established, with up to 89 % of patients showing improvements in cognition and behaviour. After as little as 2 months of treatment, symptom improvement is apparent compared with placebo, and most patients are still improved or stable after 12 months. Concomitant neurophysiological changes in the brain indicate (after only 4 - 8 weeks' treatment) improved vigilance and information processing. In patients with balance disorders, mean improvements of 44 - 78 % in symptom severity and quality of life have been observed with <b>nicergoline.</b> Although clinical experience with <b>nicergoline</b> in vascular disorders is limited to relatively shortterm, small-scale studies, it has been successfully used in rehabilitation therapy of patients with chronic ischaemic stroke. Open-label evaluations suggest that <b>nicergoline</b> may also be valuable in glaucoma, depression and peripheral arteriopathy. Adverse events of <b>nicergoline,</b> if any, are related to the central nervous system, the metabolic system and the overall body. Most are considered typical symptoms of ergot derivatives. Because of their generally mild and transient nature, treatment discontinuations occur relatively infrequently. The efficacy of <b>nicergoline</b> combined with a favourable safety and tolerability profile at commonly applied doses (60 mg/day) make this agent a valuable therapy in patients with mild to moderate dementia, vascular diseases and balance disorders...|$|E

Significant increases in lactate levels, {{as well as}} in creatine/phosphocreatine ratios (Cr/PCr), and a decrease in N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and aspartate levels were observed in aged rat brains as compared to adult animals following glucose administration. The total amount of 13 C from [1 - 13 C]glucose incorporated in glutamate, glutamine, aspartate and GABA was significantly decreased in control aged rat brains as compared to adult brains. The results showed a decrease in oxidative glucose utilization of control aged rat brains. The long-term <b>nicergoline</b> treatment increased NAA and glutamate levels, and decreased the lactate levels as well as the Cr/PCr ratios in aged rat brains as compared to adult rats. The total amount of 13 C incorporated in glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, NAA and GABA was increased by <b>nicergoline</b> treatment, showing an improvement in oxidative glucose metabolism in aged brains. A significant increase in pyruvate carboxylase/pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (PC/PDH) in the synthesis of glutamate in nicergoline-treated aged rats is consistent with an increase in the transport of glutamine from glia to neurons for conversion into glutamate. In adult rat brains, no effect of <b>nicergoline</b> on glutamate PC/PDH activity was observed, although an increase in PC/PDH activity in glutamine was, suggesting that <b>nicergoline</b> affects the glutamate/glutamine cycle between neurons and glia in different ways depending on the age of animals.

40|$|In elderly patients, {{dizziness}} occurs {{very frequently}} with significant {{effects on the}} patient's life. Its frequency increases with age, and may arise {{from a variety of}} causes. Chronic dysequilibrium in elderly patients is most probably related to disturbances within the central nervous system, due either to altered neuronal functions or to an underlying vascular disease. <b>Nicergoline,</b> a drug used in the treatment of cognitive disturbances in geriatric patients, improves dizziness in elderly demented and non-demented patients. In a double blind,placebo controlled trial the drug improved (i) the severity of symptoms, measured by the dizziness assessment rating scale (DARS), (ii) the overall clinical conditions revealed by global impression scale, and (iii) the perceived quality of life estimated by the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI). These results indicate a possible positive effect also on posturographic measures. Moreover, the improvement occurred at no expense of the established strategy of postural control suggesting that the effect is mediated by a substitute compensatory mechanism allowing the patient to preserve consolidated postural strategies. The results of previous open clinical studies in about 3000 patients are in agreement with those findings. Overall, severity of symptoms decreased by 68 % (57 % in the control study). Globally, the results indicate a beneficial effect of <b>nicergoline</b> on symptoms related to balance disorders of central origin. Animal studies show that the drug displays a broad spectrum of actions on cellular and molecular mechanisms. Moreover, animal research specifically aimed at vestibular pathophysiology has revealed that <b>nicergoline</b> improves vestibular compensation in models of vestibular lesion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Nicergoline</b> is an ergot {{derivative}} {{currently in}} use in over fifty countries {{for more than three}} decades, for the treatment of cognitive, affective, and behavioral disorders of older people. It was initially considered as a vasoactive drug and mainly prescribed for cerebrovascular disorders. Recent findings suggest other actions which has provided a rationale for the use of <b>nicergoline</b> for the treatment of various forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's Disease. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there is evidence of efficacy of <b>nicergoline</b> in the treatment of dementia and other age-associated forms of cognitive decline,and to assess the safety and tolerability of the drug. SEARCH STRATEGY: 1. Electronic databases search. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (which contains citations from the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psych LIT, and hand searches of geriatric, dementia, psychogeriatric journals, and conference abstracts) was searched using the following terms: 'Nicergoline', 'Sermion'. 2. Reference search. The reference lists of all obtained studies was checked. 3. Pharmaceutical company Pharmacia & Upjohn, owners of the rights to produce and market <b>nicergoline</b> in various different countries, was asked to provide data and reports of clinical trials. In case of unavailability of numerical data in published studies, the authors of each paper, were asked for any published or unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: - All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, published and unpublished trials were sought. Non-randomized trials were excluded. Open trials were considered for inclusion if patients were randomized to the different treatment groups. - All patients diagnosed as having dementia or other cognitive disorder defined according to classification criteria accepted at the time of each study. - <b>Nicergoline</b> given at any dose for more than one day with placebo control. Type of outcome variables: 1. Cognitive function (as measured by psychometric tests). 2. Clinical impression (such as CIBIC or other clinical global measures of change). 3. Functional performance including dependency. 4. Behavioural disturbance. 5. Safety and acceptability as measured by the incidence of adverse effects (including side-effects) leading to withdrawal. 6. Death 7. Effect on carer 8. Use of services 9. Quality of life. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive search of the international literature and the producing company archives has been performed to identify all possible sources of data for this review. Only those trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria of belonging to either category A or B of allocation concealment, as defined by the Cochrane Organisation, were examined for data extraction by one reviewer. If there was doubt then the other reviewer was consulted. Data availability restricted analyses to 'completers' analyses for the outcome measures. Outcomes able to be assessed included: Behaviour, Cognition, Clinical Judgment, Tolerability, EEG. MAIN RESULTS: The Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric Scale (SCAG) was the outcome used in the largest number of patients (814 patients). The results from these studies were homogeneous in nature despite including patients observed for periods of time ranging from 2 months to 12 months. There was a difference in favour of the active treatment in reducing the behavioural symptoms described by this scale, - 5. 18 points [- 8. 03, - 2. 33]. This scale has a maximum of 133 points. The therapeutic effects of <b>nicergoline</b> seem to be evident by 2 months of treatment and maintained for 6 months. In general other behavioural outcome measures which include the GRS, the IADL, and the MACC and were episodically used in few studies, failed to demonstrate statistically significant results although there was a trend favouring treatment. Cognitive assessment has been performed in a moderate number of patients with the MMSE (261 patients) and the ADAS-Cog (342 patients). No significant heterogeneity was found for these trials, despite the trials extending over periods of treatment of 3 to 12 months. There was a difference between treatment and control groups on the MMSE favouring <b>nicergoline</b> treatment. At 12 months the effect size was 2. 86 [0. 98, 4. 74] The effect size for the ADAS-Cog, used exclusively with Alzheimer's disease patients, did not reveal a significant benefit. At 12 months the trend favoured treatment (- 1. 64 [- 4. 62, 1. 34]). The other results from various cognitive measures tended to favour <b>nicergoline</b> but this was based on a small number of cases. The clinical impression of change obtained from a total of 921 patients was homogeneous across the studies, despite reflecting changes over periods of time ranging from 2 to 12 months. The Peto odd ratio for improvement in the subjects treated with <b>nicergoline</b> over these varying time periods was 3. 33 [2. 50, 4. 43]. Tolerability assessed in 1427 patients was homogeneous across all studies and demonstrated a mildly increased risk of adverse events on treatment, OR 1. 51 [1. 10, 2. 07]. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The clinical studies on <b>nicergoline</b> were carried out with diverse criteria and modalities of evaluation. Despite this, the 14 studies included in this review, have presented generally consistent results. Results of this meta-analysis provide some evidence of positive effects of <b>nicergoline</b> on cognition and behaviour and these effects are supported by an effect on clinical global impression. There was some evidence that there were increased risk of adverse effects associated with <b>nicergoline.</b> These results were obtained on older patients with mild to moderate cognitive and behavioural impairment of various clinical origins, including chronic cerebrovascular disorders and Alzheimer's dementia. The few studies specifically performed on patients with Alzheimer's disease were performed with too few people to give a definitive answer to the questions concerning the use of <b>nicergoline</b> for this form of dementia. This drug has not been evaluated using current diagnostic categories such as MCI or in association with therapeutic agents of different nature such as cholinesterase or antioxidant drugs...|$|E

Testing of passive defensive skill was performed on days 12 and 20 after the induction of EAE. To assess the impact of drugs on the inputted information processes the investigated substances were administered intragastrically (CSNS - intraperitoneally) once daily in the definite dose from the second to the day 10 after the induction of EAE (latent phase of the disease), and assessing processes of conditional skill preserving, further administration of drugs by the day 20 of the experiment (average duration of EAE) was used. A positive effect of citicoline, ±-lipoic acid, <b>nicergoline</b> and donepezil on the input information processes and the ability to prevent accelerated extinction of acquired contingent skill in the conditions of experimental pathology was established.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>nicergoline,</b> a new agent that blocks alpha-adrenergic receptors and {{inhibits}} platelet phospholipase, were evaluated in a canine model of platelet-mediated coronary thrombosis. In 48 open chest dogs, the circumflex coronary artery was stenosed by plicating the artery {{wall with a}} suture. Thirty-four of the 48 dogs exhibited cyclic reductions in flow in the stenotic vessel, followed by a sudden return to control levels. The reductions in flow were unabated in all but two dogs after heparin administration (1, 000 U/kg per h), unaffected by large doses of nitroglycerin and nifedipine and associated with platelet aggregates in the stenotic segment (demonstrated by histologic and electron microscopic examination). These observations support {{the conclusion that the}} flow reductions were caused by platelet aggregation rather than by fibrin deposition or vasospasm. Twenty dogs were monitored for 1 hour after heparin administration and then assigned to a control (n = 7) or nicergoline-treated (n = 13; 1 mg/kg intravenously) group. In control dogs, cyclic reductions in flow continued unchanged for another hour, whereas in the treated group they were markedly decreased in 1 dog and completely abolished in the other 12 dogs. Aspirin (30 mg/ kg intravenously) suppressed flow reductions in all control dogs, confirming the primary role of platelet aggregation in the phenomenon. This study provides a modified model of platelet-mediated thrombosis in stenosed coronary arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate that <b>nicergoline</b> can effectively interfere with platelet function in vivo. The potent antithrombotic activity exhibited by <b>nicergoline</b> might enhance the therapeutic usefulness of this vasodilator...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA fast, {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method {{has been developed}} for determination of 10 α-methoxy- 6 -methyl ergoline- 8 β-methanol (MDL, a main metabolite of <b>nicergoline)</b> in human plasma. One-step liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) with diethyl ether was employed as the sample preparation method. Tizanidine hydrochloride {{was selected as the}} internal standard (IS). Analysis was carried out on a Diamonsil ODS column (150 mm× 4. 6 mm, 5 μm) using acetonitrile–ammonium acetate (0. 1 mol/L) (15 / 85, v/v) as mobile phase at detection wavelength of 224 nm. The calibration curves were linear over the range of 2. 288 – 73. 2 ng/mL with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 2. 288 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision values were below 13 % and the recoveries were from 74. 47 % to 83. 20 % at three quality control levels. The method herein described was successfully applied in a randomized crossover bioequivalence study of two different <b>nicergoline</b> preparations after administration of 30 mg in 20 healthy volunteers...|$|E

Treatment with verapamil, tamoxifen, <b>nicergoline</b> or cyclosporin A only partially restores the activity of FCE 24517 against LoVo/ 24517 cells.

40|$|Rat {{isolated}} hearts were perfused {{through the}} left atrium with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution or {{mounted on a}} Langendorff perfusion system. The hearts were prelabelled with [3 H]-noradrenaline [(3 H]-NA) and the left main coronary artery was ligated for 10 min after which reperfusion followed. The liberation of [3 H]-NA {{and the development of}} ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation were monitored throughout. During the occlusion period, ventricular arrhythmias did not occur and heart rate was not significantly altered in the control series. In contrast, reperfusion was followed by ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in all the hearts in the control series (Langendorff or 'working' models). The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists phentolamine (7. 1 X 10 (- 6) M and 7. 1 X 10 (- 5) M) and <b>nicergoline</b> (3. 1 X 10 (- 6) M) diminished or prevented reperfusion arrhythmias. However, prazosin (5. 2 X 10 (- 6) M) was not effective. The lower concentration of phentolamine did not alter the pattern of [3 H]-NA release, whereas, high doses of phentolamine and <b>nicergoline</b> increased the release of [3 H]-NA. Prazosin (5. 2 X 10 (- 6) M) caused a very marked increase in release of [3 H]-NA but was not antiarrhythmic. A 'membrane-stabilizing' effect seems the most appropriate explanation for these antiarrhythmic effects of alpha-antagonist agents...|$|E
