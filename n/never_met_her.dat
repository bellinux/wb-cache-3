Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five.

25|$|A {{philosophical}} Radical of {{a somewhat}} mid-19th century type, and highly {{suspicious of the}} later opportunistic reaction (in all its forms) against Cobdenite principles, he yet retained {{the respect of the}} majority whom it was his usual fate to find against him in British politics by the indomitable consistency of his principles and by sheer force of character and honesty of conviction and utterance. His legacy was a purely moral one; although in May 1870 he married Mrs. Rose Mary Ayling, the union produced no heirs. Mrs. Ayling was already married when she met John Morley and the couple waited to marry until her first husband died several years later (another similarity to John Stuart Mill). She was never received into polite society, and many of his colleagues, including Asquith, <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>her.</b> Morley had three siblings, Edward Sword Morley (1828–1901), William Wheelhouse Morley (1840-Abt. 1870), and Grace Hannah Morley (1842-1925).|$|E

2500|$|In Diana Wynne Jones' Charmed Life (1977), two {{orphaned}} children receive magical education {{while living}} in a castle.

Diana Wynne Jones has stated in {{answer to a question}} on her webpage: [...] "I think Ms Rowling did get quite a few of her ideas from my books – though I have <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>her,</b> so I {{have never been able to}} ask her. My books were written many years before the Harry Potter books (Charmed Life was first published in 1977), so any similarities probably come from what she herself read as a child. Once a book is published, out in the world, it is sort of common property, for people to take ideas from and use, and I think this is what happened to my books." ...|$|E

A week later they ran another story saying her people were denying it and that: 'Richard Archer, from Hard-Fi, is a fantasist.' and that I'd made {{the whole thing up}} for publicity. The wankers.

2500|$|Mui {{experienced}} much hardship in her childhood. She was {{the youngest}} daughter {{in a family of}} four children. Her elder sister, Ann Mui, was also a singer. The children were raised in a single parent family. In some of her interviews, Mui mentioned that she had <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>her</b> father. This meant that she had to help provide for her siblings at an early age, dropping out of school at the age of 13 or 14. More hardship followed the family when the bar that her mother ran was destroyed by a fire. To earn a living, Mui entered the show business at around the age of four with her sister Ann. She performed Chinese operas and pop songs in theatres and on the streets. Both Mui and her elder sister Ann performed in practically any nightclub that offered them a chance to make a living.|$|E
2500|$|River Song first {{appears in}} the Doctor Who 2008 series two-parter [...] "Silence in the Library"/"Forest of the Dead" [...] (written by Steven Moffat) during the Russell T Davies era of Doctor Who. Here, she {{encounters}} the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) in the 52nd century and, though he has <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>her,</b> claims to be someone he will come to trust completely. River, who {{is a professor of}} archaeology and carries a TARDIS-colour/pattern diary of her adventures, is able to convince the Doctor of his future trust in her by whispering his real name into his ear; which he explains he would only divulge under rare circumstances. In the second of the two episodes she sacrifices herself to save the people who were trapped in the Library's database, knocking out the Doctor before he can do the same. In turn, he is able to upload a copy of her consciousness into a computer, allowing her to live on in a virtual world with the archaeological team she was with in the Library. He achieves this via the use of a sonic screwdriver given to her by his future self.|$|E
2500|$|Tunstall {{was born}} to a half-Chinese, half-Scottish mother Carol Ann, who was from Hong Kong, and an Irish father. Her parents met while her mother {{was working as a}} dancer in Penthouse bar in Edinburgh, where her father was a bartender. She has <b>never</b> <b>met</b> <b>her</b> {{biological}} father. She was born at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital, but at 18 days old her mother gave her for adoption to a family in St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. Her adoptive father David Tunstall was employed as a physics lecturer at the University of St Andrews, and her adoptive mother Rosemary Tunstall was a primary school teacher. Tunstall's family also includes an older brother named Joe and a younger brother named Daniel. The family had no interest in music and owned no records—the only tape her father owned was a comedy recording by mathematician and musical satirist Tom Lehrer. This was largely because Daniel is deaf and they want to avoid anything that could interfere with his hearing aid. She has said: [...] "...My earliest memories are Californian...", attributed to a sabbatical that her father took at UCLA in 1979. In spite of living in an academic family, she was musically oriented. Her parents supported her, and she recollected that she asked for a piano when she was four.|$|E
