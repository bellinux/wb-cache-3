40|$|Fish {{otoliths}} {{have provided}} biologists with a treasure-house of valuable life history information across levels of biological organization from individuals to ecosystems. Otoliths {{have long been}} used to provide the age and growth estimates which are basic data that underpin scientific fisheries and fisheries ecology. The traditional use of calcified tissues (CS) has been augmented by new applications to address questions of population connectivity, migration, and trophic ecology. These tools have become increasingly important in meeting the demands for spatially explicit and ecosystem-level management tools. Analysis of CS is now extended to applications related to spatial use (essential habitats) and as a record {{of past and present}} environmental conditions. This special volume of the ICES Journal of Marine Science contains contributions from the 5 th International Otolith Symposium (IOS 2014), an ICES Science Symposium held in October 2014, in Mallorca, Spain. IOS 2014 is a continuation of a series of symposia that started in 1993 to encourage the exchange of information and expertise and to promote the development of new techniques and applications for otolith-based analysis in ecology, management, and conservation. IOS 2014 was the largest meeting to date, with 329 participants from 45 countries. The aim of IOS 2014 was to explore the use of CS as tools to support management and define indicators at environmental, community, population, and individual levels. This international forum is the centre for the exchange of information about developments in the field. New techniques of analysis, statistical treatment, and indeed new areas of application are all presented in this forum. Regular attendees are often the prominent users of otolith analyses in their home institution, and many are active in ICES work. This is also a premier venue for interaction between ICES scientists and those working {{in other parts of the}} world. <b>North</b> <b>America,</b> Japan, <b>Taiwan,</b> and Australia are particularly active in advancing otolith techniques, and exchange of ideas and information is crucial to improving the science in the ICES community. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2015.

40|$|Changes in {{symbiont}} assemblages {{can affect}} the success and impact of invasive species, and may provide knowledge regarding the invasion histories of their vectors. Bark beetle symbioses are ideal systems to study changes in symbiont assemblages resulting from invasions. The red turpentine beetle (Dendroctonus valens) is a bark beetle species that recently invaded China from its native range in <b>North</b> <b>America.</b> It is associated with ophiostomatalean fungi in both locations, although the fungi have previously been well-surveyed only in China. We surveyed the ophiostomatalean fungi associated with D. valens in eastern and western <b>North</b> <b>America,</b> and identified the fungal species using multi-gene phylogenies. From the 307 collected isolates (147 in eastern <b>North</b> <b>America</b> and 160 in western <b>North</b> <b>America),</b> we identified 20 species: 11 in eastern <b>North</b> <b>America</b> and 13 in western <b>North</b> <b>America.</b> Four species were shared between eastern <b>North</b> <b>America</b> and western <b>North</b> <b>America,</b> one species (Ophiostoma floccosum) was shared between western <b>North</b> <b>America</b> and China, and three species (Grosmannia koreana, Leptographium procerum, and Ophiostoma abietinum) were shared between eastern <b>North</b> <b>America</b> and China. Ophiostoma floccosum and O. abietinum have worldwide distributions, and were rarely isolated from D. valens. However, G. koreana and L. procerum are primarily limited to Asia and <b>North</b> <b>America</b> respectively. Leptographium procerum, which {{is thought to be}} native to <b>North</b> <b>America,</b> represented > 45 % of the symbionts of D. valens in eastern <b>North</b> <b>America</b> and China, suggesting D. valens may have been introduced to China from eastern <b>North</b> <b>America.</b> These results are surprising, as previous population genetics studies on D. valens based on the cytochrome oxidase I gene have suggested that the insect was introduced into China from western <b>North</b> <b>America.</b> Tree Protection Cooperative Programme [URL] and the USDA Forest Service, Western Wildland Environmental Threat Assessment Center, Prineville, Oregon, USA [URL]...|$|R
