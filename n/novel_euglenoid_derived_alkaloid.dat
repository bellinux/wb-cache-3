40|$|Selection {{exerted by}} herbivores {{is a major}} force driving the {{evolution}} of plant defensive characters such as leaf trichomes or secondary metabolites. However, plant defense expression is highly variable among populations and identifying the sources of this variation remains a major challenge. Plant populations are often distributed across broad geographic ranges and are exposed to different herbivore communities, ranging from generalists (that feed on diverse plant species) to specialists (that feed on a restricted group of plants). We studied eight populations of the plant Datura stramonium usually eaten by specialist or generalist herbivores, {{in order to examine}} whether the pattern of phenotypic selection on secondary compounds (atropine and scopolamine) and a physical defense (trichome density) can explain geographic variation in these traits. Following co-evolutionary theory, we evaluated whether a more <b>derived</b> <b>alkaloid</b> (scopolamine) confers higher fitness benefits than its precursor (atropine), and whether this effect differs between specialist and generalist herbivores. Our results showed consistent directional selection in almost all populations and herbivores to reduce the concentration of atropine. The most <b>derived</b> <b>alkaloid</b> (scopolamine) was favored in only one of the populations, which is dominated by a generalist herbivore. In general, the patterns of selection support the existence of a selection mosaic and accounts for the positive correlation observed between atropine concentration and plant damage by herbivores recorded in previou...|$|R

Species of the formicine genus Brachymyrmex contain pumiliotoxins which the frogs incorporate and accumulate poison from. There is a variability of alkaloid profiles among populations and individuals of O. pumilio, which {{is indicative of}} varying levels of available prey within their intraspecific habitats. Research and physical analysis reveal that maternally <b>derived</b> <b>alkaloids</b> exist in young tadpoles. During tadpole-rearing, mother frogs feed their young an unfertilized egg from their ovaries after dropping each individual tadpole into a repository of water usually found in a bromeliad. Tadpoles lacking the obligate nutritive egg diet do not contain the alkaloid. This step is crucial for the tadpoles to sequester the alkaloid from their mother; without such, young tadpoles become susceptible to predation by arthropods and other frogs.|$|R
40|$|The Amaryllidaceae {{alkaloids}} are {{a family}} of amino acid <b>derived</b> <b>alkaloids</b> with many biological activities; examples include haemanthamine, haemanthidine, galanthamine, lycorine, and maritidine. Central to the biosynthesis {{of the majority of}} these alkaloids is a C-C phenol-coupling reaction that can have para-para’, para-ortho’, or ortho-para’ regiospecificity. Through comparative transcriptomics of Narcissus sp. aff. pseudonarcissus, Galanthus sp., and Galanthus elwesii we have identified a para-para’ C-C phenol coupling cytochrome P 450, CYP 96 T 1, capable of forming the products (10 bR, 4 aS) -noroxomaritidine and (10 bS, 4 aR) -noroxomaritidine from 4 ’-O-methylnorbelladine. CYP 96 T 1 was also shown to catalyzed formation of the para-ortho’ phenol coupled product, N-demethylnarwedine, as less than 1 % of the total product. CYP 96 T 1 co-expresses with the previously characterized norbelladine 4 ’-O-methyltransferase. The discovery of CYP 96 T 1 is of special interest because it catalyzes the first major branch in Amaryllidaceae alkaloid biosynthesis.

Recently, other classes of natural compounds such as terpenoids, sesquiterpene glycosides and coumarins have been studied as new AChE inhibitors, with the aim to discover less toxic compounds compared to alkaloidal ones. The Ferulago campestris roots dichloromethane extract was used for a bioassay-guided fractionation for the search of AChE inhibitors. Three coumarin derivatives (umbelliprenin 1, coladonin 2 and coladin 3), three daucane ester derivatives (siol anisate 4, ferutinin 5 and 1 -acetyl- 5 -angeloyl lapiferol 6), two phenol derivatives (2 -epilaserine 7 and epielmanticine 8) and one polyacetylene (9 -epoxyfalcarindiol 9) were isolated by the bioassayguided approach.

Although alkaloids from other plant sources have been extensively researched, studies on the hepatotoxic effects of comfrey alkaloids are scant. The effects of high dose comfrey toxicity have been studied and the present investigation was undertaken to identify changes associated with relatively low dose toxicity. Eight young adult rats were dosed weekly for six weeks with 50 mg/kg of comfrey <b>derived</b> <b>alkaloids.</b> The animals were dissected {{one week after the}} last dose and the livers examined by light and electron microscopy. Changes at the light microscopic level showed vascular congestion, mild zone 3 necrosis and loss of definition of hepatocyte cellular membranes.

A striking finding was florid bleb formation on the sinusoidal borders of hepatocytes. Many blebs were shed into the space of Disse and extruded to fill, and sometimes occlude, sinusoidal lumina. Platelets were frequently found in areas of bleb formation. There was evidence of late damage in collagenization of Disse's space.

40|$|The trophic {{interactions}} of entomopathogenic fungi in different ecological niches viz., soil, plants, or insect themselves are effectively regulated by their maneuvered metabolomes and {{the plethora of}} metabotypes. In this article, we discuss a holistic framework of co-evolutionary metabolomes and metabotypes to model the {{interactions of}} biocontrol fungi especially with mycosed insects. Conventionally, the studies involving fungal biocontrol mechanisms are reported {{in the context of}} much aggrandized fungal entomotoxins while the adaptive response mechanisms of host insects are relatively overlooked. The present review asserts that the selective pressure exerted among the competing or interacting species drives alterations in their overall metabolomes which ultimately implicates in corresponding metabotypes. Quintessentially, metabolomics offers a most generic and tractable model to assess the fungal-insect antagonism in terms of interaction biomarkers, biosynthetic pathway plasticity, and their co-evolutionary defense. The fungi chiefly rely on a battery of entomotoxins viz., secondary metabolites falling in the categories of NRP's (non-ribosomal peptides), PK's (polyketides), lysine <b>derive</b> <b>alkaloids,</b> and terpenoids. On the contrary, insects overcome mycosis through employing different layers of immunity manifested as altered metabotypes (phenoloxidase activity) and overall metabolomes viz., carbohydrates, lipids, fatty acids, amino acids, and eicosanoids. Here, we discuss the recent findings within conventional premise of fungal entomotoxicity and the evolution of truculent immune response among host insect. The metabolomic frameworks for fungal-insect interaction can potentially transmogrify our current comprehensions of biocontrol mechanisms to develop the hypervirulent biocontrol strains with least environmental concerns. Moreover, the interaction metabolomics (interactome) in complementation with other -omics cascades could further be applied to address the fundamental bottlenecks of adaptive co-evolution among biological species...|$|R

Both C-C and C-heteroatom bonds can be formed in an enantioselective fashion using many types of catalyst and the field is always growing. Many kind of chiral catalysts have emerged as privileged, but among them Proline, cinchona alkaloids, BINOL, and their derivatives showed to be particularly useful chiral scaffolds. This thesis, after a short presentation of many organocatalysts and activation modes, focuses mainly on cinchona <b>alkaloid</b> <b>derived</b> primary amines and BINOL derived chiral Brønsted acids, describing their properties and applications. Then, in the experimental part, these compounds are used for the catalysis of new transformations. The enantioselective Friedel-Crafts alkylation of cyclic enones with naphthols using cinchona <b>alkaloid</b> <b>derived</b> primary amines as catalysts is presented and discussed. The results of this work were very good and this resulted also in a publication. The same catalysts are then used to accomplish the enantioselective addition of indoles to cyclic enones. Many catalysts in combination with many acids as co-catalysts were tried and the reaction was fully studied. Selective N-alkylation was obtained in many cases, in combination with quite good to good enantioselectivities. Also other kind of catalysis were tried for this reaction, with interesting results. Another aza-Michael reaction between OH-free hydroxylamines and nitrostyrene using cinchona <b>alkaloid</b> <b>derived</b> thioureas is briefly discussed.
