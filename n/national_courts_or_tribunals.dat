50|$|The English Court of Appeal {{found the}} Area Health Authority an ‘emanation of the State’, observing that the AHA {{respondent}} was constituted under s 8 (1) a (b) {{of the national}} health service act 1977. The court made reference of two questions for preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice. Firstly whether the respondents dismissal {{on the grounds that}} she was a woman who had passed the normal retiring age was an act of discrimination prohibited by the directive. Secondly, if the answer to the first is affirmative, whether or not the equal treatment directive can be relied upon by the appellant in the circumstances in <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> <b>or</b> <b>tribunals,</b> not withstanding the inconsistency, if any between the directive and the sexual discrimination act.|$|E

If that is the case, it is for that <b>court</b> <b>or</b> <b>tribunal</b> to establish all the consequences thereby arising under national law, in order to ensure that the consumer is not bound by that clause...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{decision}} on jurisdiction and admissibility in Abaclat and others v. Argentina {{has brought to}} the public’s attention the issue of sovereign defaults and restructuring. Whilst in the Abaclat case, claimants were mostly individual retirees who then assembled to file a class action, a more frightening protagonist {{is made up of}} “vulture” funds. These are hedge funds, or other financial vehicles, which purchase sovereign (or corporate) bonds on secondary markets when their prices are extremely low due to the debtor’s repudiation or inability to pay back. They then litigate before <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> <b>or</b> international arbitral <b>tribunals</b> in order to recover the entire sums accrued. The analysis in this article begins with an overview of the process of sovereign debt restructuring. We then explore the case of a vulture fund which does not participate in a debt restructuring, and proceeds to enforce an award condemning a State to pay on its bonds, outside of the ICSID framework. Art. V(2) of the New York Convention offers two potential grounds to the State: non-arbitrability and public policy. We examine the interpretations given to the two notions in several cases most relevant to our research. Arguably, the interests involved in debt restructuring proceedings do appear to be sufficient to preclude arbitrability of the subject matter, and thus the enforcement of the award may be prevented. Secondly, the permeability of the public policy exception to economic considerations of fundamental importance – such as those involved in sovereign debt restructuring – finds supporting evidence in a host of jurisdictions. The two grounds might thus be used by States to “break the bond” and prevent non-participating vulture funds from obtaining an unfair advantage over the rest of the creditors.

The most evident answer is a <b>court</b> <b>or</b> <b>tribunal</b> from a Member State, as it is established in the EU Treaties. The CJEU has developed a European concept of a <b>court</b> <b>or</b> <b>tribunal</b> through case law, but the EU Member States have diverse legal systems {{and there is no}} uniformity on the consideration of some bodies as a <b>court</b> <b>or</b> <b>tribunal.</b> Furthermore, the CJEU has had some problems with the interpretation of what a <b>court</b> <b>or</b> <b>tribunal</b> is, has added new criteria and has departed from some positions. On top of that, the EU has been growing and each enlargement has brought and will bring countries with more diverse legal systems.
