40|$|The {{reduction}} in deaths from diarrheal diseases {{is one of}} the significant public health successes of the twentieth century. That said, the disease still accounts for a significant burden of childhood morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Progress made in the past has, to a significant extent, been supported by a variety of both bilateral and multilateral donors aiming to make an impact in reducing this burden. We review the history of international aid in the context of disease control, and the variety of ways in which international aid has driven the international agenda, including a description of the activities of key players during this period, as well as the experiences of <b>national</b> <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> We conclude with a discussion of what is known to date about the effectiveness of international aid in supporting <b>national</b> <b>control</b> <b>programmes,</b> as well as some important areas of focus for future efforts.

40|$|Since 2004 the West African {{countries}} of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have implemented national schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis control programmes with financial and technical {{support from the}} Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI). In {{the first three years}} of the control programmes, nearly 13 · 5 million doses of praziquantel and albendazole have been administered against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis with coverage rates varying between 67 · 0 % and 93 · 9 %. These treatments have resulted in a reduction of the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma infection in the sentinel cohorts that were set up to monitor and evaluate the <b>national</b> <b>control</b> <b>programmes.</b> The challenges currently faced by these <b>national</b> <b>control</b> <b>programmes</b> are the ability to maintain the reduction in morbidity achieved thus far due to the mass treatment campaigns and ensuring sustainability. For reinforcement of surveillance, the establishment of a geographical information system is suggested in order to contribute towards enhanced sustainability of these programmes. Our new working hypothesis is that targeted control accompanied by periodic mass treatment campaigns (every two to three years) can contribute to maintaining the low levels of morbidity achieved thus far. The implementation of integrated neglected tropical disease control programmes in these countries will provide means to ensure the financial sustainability of control activities for the years to come...|$|E

40|$|Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) {{occurs in}} sub-Saharan Africa. It {{is caused by}} the {{protozoan}} parasite Trypanosoma brucei, transmitted by tsetse flies. Almost all cases are due to Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, which is indigenous to west and central Africa. Prevalence is strongly dependent on control measures, which are often neglected during periods of political instability, thus leading to resurgence. With fewer than 12 000 cases of this disabling and fatal disease reported per year, trypanosomiasis belongs to the most neglected tropical diseases. The clinical presentation is complex, and diagnosis and treatment difficult. The available drugs are old, complicated to administer, and can cause severe adverse reactions.

40|$|Background: There {{remains a}} lack of {{epidemiological}} data on the geographical distribution of trachoma to support global mapping and scale up of interventions {{for the elimination of}} trachoma. The Global Atlas of Trachoma (GAT) was launched in 2011 to address these needs and provide standardised, updated and accessible maps.

40|$|Considering the {{epidemic}} situation of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) {{at the end}} of the twentieth century, the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners strengthened disease control and surveillance. Over the last 15 years, the activities implemented through the <b>National</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Programmes</b> have brought gambiense HAT under control and now its elimination is deemed as an achievable goal.

Epidemiological survey teams in some areas have tentatively started to use serology and their experience indicates that antibody detection suffies in eradicated or controlled areas with low expected prevalence but that detection of circulating antigens is needed for assessment of the incidence of infection or reinfection in areas recently brought under control.
