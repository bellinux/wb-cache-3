40|$|Speculation {{continues}} {{as to the}} real significance and effectiveness of the “market reforms” introduced {{by the government of}} North Korea in July 2002. Some commentators regard these as rather minor, while others suggest that they represent the first stage of a significant move towards a much more open and decentralized system. In this paper, the details of the reforms are discussed, and it is argued that their significance can only be judged in terms of the underlying dynamics of the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> regime. Using constructs from regime theory and regime dynamics, the current system is defined, and the stability of its elements is evaluated.

25|$|According to {{a report}} by Reuters, the NSA also tried to {{sabotage}} North Korea's nuclear program using a version of Stuxnet. The operation was reportedly launched in tandem with the attack that targeted Iranian centrifuges in 2009–10. The <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>nuclear</b> program shares many similarities with the Iranian, both having been developed with technology transferred by Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan. The effort failed, however, because North Korea's extreme secrecy and isolation made it impossible to introduce Stuxnet into the nuclear facility.|$|E

With data acquired before, during and after the alleged <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> underground <b>nuclear</b> test on October 9, 2006, wide area change detection techniques using medium resolution optical/infrared satellite sensors are combined with localized high-resolution imagery to attempt to pinpoint the test location within the area identified by the seismic measurements. Problems associated with the timeliness, degree of coverage and ambiguity of the remote sensing data are pointed out, however it is generally concluded that their integration into the CTBT regime would valuably complement the existing seismic observation network...|$|R

25|$|In 2004, Ban {{replaced}} Yoon Young-kwan {{as foreign}} minister of South Korea under president Roh Moo-hyun.

Ban survived scrutiny from lawmakers and saw an upturn in his popularity when talks began with North Korea. Ban became actively involved in issues relating to North-South Korean relationships.

50|$|Syria is a {{signatory}} to the NPT and has {{a limited}} civil nuclear program. Before {{the advent of the}} Syrian Civil War it was known to operate only one small Chinese-built research reactor, SRR-1. Despite being a proponent of a Weapons of Mass Destruction Free Zone in the Middle East the country was accused of pursuing a military nuclear program with a reported nuclear facility in a desert Syrian region of Deir ez-Zor. The reactor's components had likely been designed and manufactured in North Korea, with the reactor's striking similarity in shape and size to the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> Yongbyon <b>Nuclear</b> Scientific Research Center. That information alarmed Israeli military and intelligence {{to such a degree that}} the idea of a targeted airstrike was conceived. It resulted in Operation Orchard, that took place on September 6, 2007 and saw as many as eight Israeli aircraft taking part. Israeli government is said to have bounced the idea of the operation off the US Bush administration, although the latter disagreed to participate. The nuclear reactor was destroyed in the attack, which also killed about ten <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> workers. The attack didn't cause an international outcry or any serious Syrian retaliatory moves as both parties tried to keep it secret: Israel didn't want publicity as regards its breach of international law while Syria wasn't willing to acknowledge its clandestine nuclear program.|$|R
2500|$|Although Koizumi's {{foreign policy}} {{was focused on}} closer {{relations}} with the United States and UN-centered diplomacy, which were adopted by all of his predecessors, he went further to pursue supporting the US policies in the War on Terrorism.

Many Japanese commentators indicated that the favorable US-Japan relation was based on the Koizumi's personal friendship with the US President George W. Bush. White House officials described the first meeting between Koizumi and Bush at Camp David as [...] "incredibly warm", with the two men playing catch with a baseball. In the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> abductions and <b>nuclear</b> development issues, Koizumi took more assertive attitudes than his predecessors.|$|R
40|$|In {{the winter}} of 2012 - 13, North Korea’s third nuclear test, yet another {{long-range}} missile test, and increasingly provocative rhetoric threatened stability in Northeast Asia. Once again, North Korea engaged in bluster designed to project strength and resolve {{in the face of}} international disapproval. In {{the first few months of}} 2013 alone, the North threatened a nuclear attack on the United States, unilaterally withdrew from the 1953 Armistice, declared a ‘state of war’ existed on the Korean Peninsula and cut the military hotline between the North and South. For their part, the US and South Korea signed a protocol for dealing with provocations from the North, flew B- 2 Stealth bombers across South Korea as a show of force to deter the North, and conducted military exercises together in March 2013. Combined with revelations in November 2010 of a <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> uranium <b>nuclear</b> program, nuclear tests of a plutonium-based weapon in 2006 and 2009, and continuing fears of missile and nuclear proliferation, the Peninsula is in a new Cold War. Deterrence, isolation, and symbolic shows of force and determination are the current strategies in place, and the “North Korea problem” remains as intractable as ever...|$|R
25|$|By comparison, {{the first}} {{plutonium}} core nuclear device {{tested by the}} United States (Trinity test) had a yield of 20 kilotons of TNT, and the first nuclear device detonated by India in 1974, though of primitive design, had a yield {{in the region of}} 8 kilotons of TNT. If the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>nuclear</b> test is less than even a kiloton in yield, it would be a historically small inaugural nuclear test. Even if it were as many as the reported intentional yield of 4 kt it would be the smallest nuclear test ever conducted by a state as a first test. Some advanced nuclear powers have produced very small tactical nuclear weapons in the low-kiloton range, but their development is far more technologically challenging than that of weapons in the 15–20 kiloton range, requiring advanced weapons materials and core geometries.|$|E
25|$|However, {{except for}} the policy toward the North Korea, Roh was {{supportive}} toward the United States. Roh endeavored to improve relations with North Korea, becoming the first president {{to cross the border}} by foot and meeting Kim Jong-il. He dispatched the Zaytun Division to support the US in the Iraq War by carrying out peacekeeping and other reconstruction-related tasks. Roh explained the deployment as only a peacekeeping mission and claimed that such commitment was required to bring favor from the United States in resolving the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>nuclear</b> crisis. He also pursued the KORUS FTA. In 2004, the Roh administration reached an agreement with the US to move out all US forces in the capital to Camp Humphreys, a rural area far away from the capital or major cities, as he deemed the USFK's presence in the capital unnecessary and harming its reputation and development.|$|E
25|$|The Daily Telegraph, citing {{anonymous}} sources, {{reported that}} in December 2006, a top Syrian official (according to one article this {{was the head of}} the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria, Ibrahim Othman) arrived in London under a false name. The Mossad had detected a booking for the official in a London hotel, and dispatched at least ten undercover agents to London. The agents were split into three teams. One group was sent to Heathrow Airport to identify the official as he arrived, a second to book into his hotel, and a third to monitor his movements and visitors. Some of the operatives were from the Kidon Division, which specializes in assassinations, and the Neviot Division, which specializes in breaking into homes, embassies, and hotel rooms to install bugging devices. On the first day of his visit, he visited the Syrian embassy and then went shopping. Kidon operatives closely followed him, while Neviot operatives broke into his hotel room and found his laptop. A computer expert then installed software that allowed the Mossad to monitor his activities on the computer. When the computer material was examined at Mossad headquarters, officials found blueprints and hundreds of pictures of the Kibar facility in various stages of construction, and correspondence. One photograph showed <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>nuclear</b> official Chon Chibu meeting with Ibrahim Othman, Syria's atomic energy agency director. Though the Mossad had originally planned to kill the official in London, it was decided to spare his life following the discovery. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was notified. The following month, Olmert formed a three-member panel to report on Syria's nuclear program. The CIA was also informed and the American intelligence network joined the quest for more information. Six months later, Brigadier-General Yaakov Amidror, one of the panel's members, informed Olmert that Syria was working with North Korea and Iran on a nuclear facility. Iran had funneled $1 billion to the project, and planned on using the Kibar facility to replace Iranian facilities if Iran was unable to complete its uranium enrichment program.|$|E
50|$|However, {{it can be}} also {{suggested}} that the Sunshine Policy had some positive effect on North Korea’s military and nuclear stance. Kim Suk-young mentions that <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> government is “both strong and weak” and it is affected by “external and internal pressures” and its decisions to militarize and nuclearize or not are made due to relationship with other countries. The author of Inside the Red Box: North Korea’s Post-Totalitarian Politics, Patrick McEachern also analyzes that the North Korea’s government has not decides its policies Moreover, he stated that North Korea has never changed its behaviors to become peaceful by others' pressures, and suggests it never will. The view that the Sunshine Policy de-escalated tensions is may be given weight by comparing the number of <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> missile and <b>nuclear</b> tests during Sunshine Policy period and the present unfriendly policy since Lee administration. North Korea engaged in nuclear tests five times and missile tests eight times in eight years since 2008; by comparison one nuclear test and three missile tests were carried out before 2008. However this may also be indicative of the North gaining the technological capabilities to conduct extensive nuclear and missile tests circa 2008. (Refer to List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea, List of <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> missile tests, Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3, Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the status and}} prospects of the global, nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament regime. It finds that although the immediate crises over the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> and Iranian <b>nuclear</b> programs are serious, they are also likely manageable. Far more problematic for the regime’s long-term survival is the possible deterioration of the international security environment resulting from shifts in the global balance of power, severe climate change, and nuclear weapons retentionism by the current nuclear-armed states. Additionally, the accelerating spread of nuclear technology and expertise threatens to put nuclear weapons within easier reach of more states. Overall, the prospects for the regime remain uncertain and the window for action on nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament may be beginning to close. States should act now, and with resolve, to mitigate risks and to strengthen the regime in preparation for more challenging times ahead...|$|R
