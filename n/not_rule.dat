5|$|Hammurabi {{entered into}} a {{protracted}} war with Ishme-Dagan I of Assyria for control of Mesopotamia, with both kings making alliances with minor states {{in order to gain}} the upper hand. Eventually Hammurabi prevailed, ousting Ishme-Dagan I just before his own death. Mut-Ashkur the new king of Assyria was forced to pay tribute to Hammurabi, however Babylon did <b>not</b> <b>rule</b> Assyria directly.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 Sikorski was exhumed and his {{remains were}} {{examined}} by Polish scientists, who in 2009 concluded that he died due to injuries consistent with an air crash, {{and that there was}} no evidence that Sikorski was murdered, ruling out theories that he was shot or strangled before the incident; however they did <b>not</b> <b>rule</b> out the possibility of sabotage, which is still being investigated by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance. , the investigation continues.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, the Anne Frank House {{published}} {{new research}} pointing to investigation over ration card fraud, rather than betrayal, as a plausible {{explanation for the}} raid {{that led to the}} arrest of the Franks. The report states that other activities in the building may have led authorities there, including activities of Frank's company. However, it does <b>not</b> <b>rule</b> out betrayal.|$|E

5|$|Russia, Armenia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan are {{all members}} of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), an {{alternative}} military alliance. In 2009, Russian envoy Dmitry Rogozin did <b>not</b> <b>rule</b> out joining NATO at some point, but stated that Russia was currently more interested in leading a coalition as a great power. Azerbaijan has committed to a policy of neutrality, but has not ruled out eventually joining NATO or the CSTO.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{rejected}} that argument, essentially ruling that under {{federal income tax}} law all the future income earned by Mr. Earl was taxable {{to him at the}} time he earned the income, even though he had already assigned part of the income to his wife, and regardless of the validity of the assignment agreement under state law. The Court in Lucas v. Earl did <b>not</b> <b>rule</b> that wages are not taxable.|$|E

5|$|After the discovery, Libby Sheldon of University College London {{conducted}} several {{tests to}} verify the painting's age, including spectroscopy and laser microscopy. The age of the inscription was taken into consideration, and found to be contemporaneous {{with the rest of}} the painting. Pigments, including a type of yellow pigment rarely found after 1600, were appropriate for the 16th century. Dendrochronological analysis later showed that the work was too late to be a life portrait of Jane, but did <b>not</b> <b>rule</b> out the possibility of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|During the January 2010 tournament, {{a tabloid}} {{magazine}} claimed Asashōryū punched his personal manager after getting drunk during {{a night out}} in downtown Nishiazabu. After the tournament Asashōryū was reprimanded by Japan Sumo Association (JSA) head Musashigawa, and he apologised once again for his behaviour. However, it subsequently emerged {{that it was not}} his manager but a restaurant employee who was attacked, reportedly sustaining a broken nose. The man did not file a report with the police, and on 31 January 2010, Asashōryū told the authorities that he had reached a settlement with him. Despite this, the police did <b>not</b> <b>rule</b> out the possibility of questioning Asashōryū about the assault.|$|E

5|$|Hassium is {{not known}} to occur {{naturally}} on Earth; the half-lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that no primordial hassium would have survived to the present day. This does <b>not</b> <b>rule</b> {{out the possibility of}} unknown longer-lived isotopes or nuclear isomers existing, some of which could still exist in trace quantities today if they are long-lived enough. In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities. This was theorized in order to explain the extreme radiation damage in some minerals that could not have been caused by any known natural radioisotopes, but could have been caused by superheavy elements.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Reyes was {{contacted}} by Doggett, now an FBI agent assigned to X-Files department, {{to assist in}} on a case involving the disappearances of several individuals {{who claimed to be}} alien abductees, as well as the disappearance of fellow agent Fox Mulder. Because of her background, Reyes considered that these believers may have simply formed a cult, but did <b>not</b> <b>rule</b> out the possibility of alien intervention. She stayed with the case until after Mulder was returned by his abductors, but returned to her field office soon after.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that {{four sets of}} European human remains found could possibly be women. He initially suspected that DNA testing would not offer up anything more, but to his surprise they registered {{that there was no}} 'Y' chromosomal element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that {{it could be that the}} DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could <b>not</b> <b>rule</b> it out completely.|$|E

5|$|In December 1983, Graysmith tracks Allen {{down to a}} Vallejo Ace Hardware store, {{where he}} is {{employed}} as a sales clerk. The men have a brief encounter before Graysmith leaves. Eight years later, victim Mike Mageau meets with authorities and identifies Allen from a police mugshot. As the authorities walk by an airport book store, copies of Graysmith's book Zodiac are shown. Final title cards inform the audience that Allen died in 1992 before he could be questioned further. A DNA test performed in 2002 on an archived autopsy sample did not match a partial DNA sample gathered from the postage stamp {{on one of the}} Zodiac letters, but this does <b>not</b> <b>rule</b> him out as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the {{corporation}} tax act of 1909 did not violate the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Court did <b>not</b> <b>rule</b> that excise taxes consisted only of taxes on corporations and corporate privileges, {{to the exclusion of}} taxes on individuals (natural persons). The issue of the validity of an income tax imposed on individuals was neither presented to the Court nor decided by the Court.|$|E

The True Finns and the Green League have both confirmed that the two parties are ideologically too far from each other to sit in the same coalition. The True Finns' main campaign issues—lowering refugee quotas and cutting foreign aid and Finland's financial contribution to the EU—were seen as a possible hindrance to coalition talks.|$|E
