2500|$|Some {{people are}} {{citizens}} of multiple nation-states.

5000|$|Multiple {{citizenship}}, {{also called}} dual citizenship <b>or</b> multiple <b>nationality</b> <b>or</b> dual <b>nationality,</b> is a person's citizenship status, {{in which a}} person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one state under the laws of those states. There is no international convention which determines the <b>nationality</b> <b>or</b> citizen status of a person, which is defined exclusively by national laws, which vary and can be inconsistent with each other. Multiple citizenship arises because different countries use different, and not necessarily mutually exclusive, criteria for citizenship. Colloquial speech refers to people [...] "holding" [...] multiple citizenship but technically each nation makes a claim that this person be considered its national.|$|R
30|$|Though the Spanish {{population}} registers are a preferred source for studying spatial distribution, we must nevertheless mention their limits. First, registers may sometimes overestimate {{the number of}} foreigners who leave Spain without being removed from the register (or when a community delays in removing individuals from the register). In recognition of this limit, the INE implemented two sets of measures in 2004 and 2006 to automatically remove foreign nationals from the register {{when they do not}} renew their registration every 2  years. Padrón’s second limitation is related to categorization; the acquisition of Spanish <b>nationality</b> (<b>or</b> dual <b>nationality)</b> by a number of foreign (especially Latin American) immigrants has led to the disappearance of individuals as foreign nationals, although they remain immigrants. Moreover, referring to places of birth instead of nationality would not be a solution. Using this criterion, Spaniards born outside the national territory would be considered as foreign nationals. 3 Such cases have been numerous since the emigration of the Franco period.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{transnational}} couples, in which spouses have different <b>nationalities</b> <b>or</b> double <b>nationality,</b> <b>or</b> reside in different States, {{has been increasing}} in the last years. The aim {{of this article is}} to analyse the issue of double nationality in European family law, limiting the scope of research on matrimonial matters. It will be first argued that double nationality is not a new topic in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) case law, starting from the well-known Micheletti judgment. The principle outlined twenty years ago has been recently confirmed in the Hadadi case, regarding the determination of the competent court in divorce proceedings, thus in the field of private international law. It will then be analysed whether situations of double nationality are also likely to occur in conflict-of-laws issues. Reference must be made today to EU Regulation no. 1259 / 2010 on implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of the law applicable to divorce and legal separation. Since situations of double nationality are probable, three solutions will be envisaged, among which a possible «renewal» of the «effective nationality» principle in EU law. This article will finally argue that nationality, a traditional connecting factor well rooted in civil law countries, still resists and may have an important role in the choice of the applicable law by the parties to a dispute regarding divorce or legal separation...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of February 1962, 22 teams submitted applications for the race, with the final list of 15 announced {{at the end of}} the month. The Spanish-based [...] was the first choice reserve team. Each of the 15 teams consisted of 10 cyclists (150 total), an increase from the 1961 Tour, which had 11 teams of 12 cyclists (132 total). Each team was required to have a dominant nationality; at least six cyclists should have the same <b>nationality,</b> <b>or</b> only two <b>nationalities</b> should be present. For the first time, the French cyclists were outnumbered; there were 52 Italian cyclists and 50 French cyclists, the largest numbers from a nation, including Belgium with 28. Riders represented a further six nations, all European.|$|R

5000|$|While {{one case}} of {{statelessness}} was {{identified in the}} Protocol relating to a Certain Case of Statelessness at the League of Nations Codification Conference, 1930 in The Hague: [...] "In a State whose nationality is not conferred by the mere fact of birth in its territory, a person born in its territory of a mother possessing the nationality of that State and of a father without <b>nationality</b> <b>or</b> of unknown <b>nationality</b> shall have the nationality of the said State." [...] Overtime, many signatories have adjusted their laws to ensure this rule remains true. (For example, in Australian nationality law, a child born in the country acquires citizenship if any parent is a citizen). However, despite this, many cases remained ambiguous or uncovered primarily {{due to the fact}} that a person did not always receive the <b>nationality</b> of its parents, <b>or</b> was born in a certain place and not always provided citizenship of that state.|$|R
