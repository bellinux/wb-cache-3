We performed a retrospective review of patient case records attending two specialist <b>neuro-otology</b> outpatient clinics to determine the prevalence and clinical phenotype of functional eye movement disorders. Our results have confirmed that functional eye movements are a common presentation to <b>neuro-otology</b> clinics, with a prevalence of upto 4 %. Convergence spasm and functional limitation of gaze are the commonest types seen in our clinics. Almost half the patients with a functional eye movement disorder had an associated functional non-ocular movement disorder, most commonly affecting gait.

40|$|Objectives: The primary {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the bedside head impulse test (bHIT) using the video HIT (vHIT) as the gold standard for quantifying the function of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Secondary aims were {{to determine}} the bHIT inter-rater reliability, and sensitivity in detecting unilateral and bilateral vestibulopathy. Methods: In this prospective study, 500 consecutive outpatients presenting to a tertiary <b>neuro-otology</b> clinic with vertigo or dizziness of various vestibular etiologies who did not have any of the pre-defined exclusion criteria were recruited. Bedside HITs were done by three experienced <b>neuro-otology</b> clinicians masked to the diagnosis, and the results were compared with the vHIT. The patients were likewise blinded to the bHIT and vHIT findings. Patients with VOR deficits were identified on the vHIT by referencing to the pre-selected pathological gain of 40 %, the bHIT sensitivity = 51. 7 % and 83 %, respectively. For bilateral vestibulopathy, overall bHIT sensitivity = 66. 3 %, reaching 86. 84 % for severely reduced bidirectional gains. Conclusions: For the primary outcome, the bHIT had moderate sensitivity and low PPV. While the study did not elucidate the best choice for vHIT reference, it demonstrated how the bHIT test properties varied with vHIT thresholds: selecting a lower threshold improved the sensitivity but diminished the PPV, while a higher threshold had the opposite effect. The VOR was most likely normal if the bHIT was negative due to its high NPV. The bHIT was moderately sensitive for detecting unilateral and bilateral vestibulopathy overall, but better for certain subgroups...|$|E

ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that learning in an online classroom would result in similar outcomes as learning in the traditional classroom when using a flipped classroom pedagogy. DesignRandomized controlled trial. A total of 274 subjects enrolled in a <b>Neuro-otology</b> training program for non-Neuro-otologists of 25 [*]h held over a 3 -day period. Subjects were randomized into a “control” group attending a traditional classroom and a “trial” group of equal numbers participating in an online synchronous Internet streaming classroom using the Adobe Connect e-learning platform. InterventionsSubjects were randomized into a “control” group attending a traditional classroom and a “treatment” group of equal numbers participating in an online synchronous Internet streaming classroom. Main outcome measuresPre- and post-multiple choice examinations of VOR, Movement, Head Turns, Head Tremor, Neurodegeneration, Inferior Olivary Complex, Collateral Projections, Eye Movement Training, Visual Saccades, Head Saccades, Visual Impairment, Walking Speed, Neuroprotection, Autophagy, Hyperkinetic Movement, Eye and Head Stability, Oscilllatory Head Movements, Gaze Stability, Leaky Neural Integrator, Cervical Dystonia, INC and Head Tilts, Visual Pursuits, Optokinetic Stimulation, and Vestibular Rehabilitation. MethodsAll candidates took a pretest examination of the subject material. The 2 – 9 [*]h and 1 – 8 [*]h sessions over three consecutive days were given live {{in the classroom and}} synchronously in the online classroom using the Adobe Connect e-learning platform. Subjects randomized to the online classroom attended the lectures in a location of their choice and viewed the sessions live on the Internet. A posttest examination was given to all candidates after completion of the course. Two sample unpaired t tests with equal variances were calculated for all pretests and posttests for all groups including gender differences. ResultsAll 274 subjects demonstrated statistically significant learning by comparison of their pre- and posttest scores. There were no statistically significant differences in the test scores between the two groups of 137 subjects each (0. 8 %, 95 % CI 85. 45917 – 86. 67952; P[*]=[*] 0. 9195). A total of 101 males in the traditional classroom arm had statistically significant lower scores than 72 females (0. 8 %, 95 % CI 84. 65716 – 86. 53096; P[*]=[*] 0. 0377) but not in the online arm (0. 8 %, 95 % CI 85. 46172 – 87. 23135; P[*]=[*] 0. 2176) with a moderate effect size (Cohen’s d[*]=[*]− 0. 407). ConclusionThe use of a synchronous online classroom in <b>neuro-otology</b> clinical training has demonstrated similar outcomes to the traditional classroom. The online classroom is a low cost and effective complement to medical specialty training in <b>Neuro-Otology.</b> The significant difference in outcomes between males and females who attended the traditional classroom suggests that women may do better than males in this learning environment, although the effect size is moderate.

40|$|SummaryMiddle ear cholesteatoma is an {{aggressive}} form of chronic otitis media requiring surgical therapy. The surgical strategy {{depends on the}} location of the lesion, its extensions to the middle ear and mastoid, the anatomical conformation of the tympanomastoid cavities and the health status of the patient (as well as his or her interest in aquatic leisure activities). For several years, imaging of the ear has been a routine test in the preoperative work-up of the disease. National guidelines for the topic “Imaging of non-operated middle ear cholesteatoma” were prepared in October 2010, for the annual congress of the French Society of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery (SFORL), by a panel of experts from the SFORL, represented by the French Association of Otology and <b>Neuro-otology</b> (AFON), and the French Radiological Society (SFR), represented by the French Society of Head and Neck Imaging (CIREOL).

40|$|Background: It is {{reported}} in some individual patients that vestibular stimuli can trigger migraine attacks. This study used a case-control design to examine systematically {{the hypothesis that}} vertigo induced by vestibular stimulation (rotation/caloric testing) {{can act as a}} specific migraine trigger. Methods: A total of 123 new patients attending <b>neuro-otology</b> or neurology clinics were studied with questionnaires and physician interview to ascertain migraine history according to Interna-tional Headache Society criteria. A total of 79 who underwent rotation/caloric vestibular testing (test group) were compared with 44 control patients in whom no such testing was carried out (control group). The principal outcomemeasure was the occurrence of a migraine attack within 24 hours of exposure to vestibular stimulation. Results: Of those participants with a past history of migraines, 19 / 39 (49 %) of the test group experienced a migraine in the study time window, compared with 1 / 21 (5 %) of the control group.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} preoperative hearing, dizziness, and tinnitus handicap {{in patients}} with unilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS). Design: Prospective administration of the Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), prior to surgical intervention. Setting: A tertiary referral <b>neuro-otology</b> clinic. Participants: A total of 145 consecutive patients who were admitted for excision of their vestibular schwannomas between May 1998 and July 2002. Main Outcome Measures: HHI, THI, and DHI scores. Results: HHI, THI, and DHI scores were all {{found to be significantly}} correlated. There was no significant association between tumor size and any of the questionnaire scores. When data were categorized to give a measure of handicap severity, 68 % had mild to significant hearing handicap, 30 % had mild to severe tinnitus handicap, and 75 % had mild to severe dizziness handicap. Eighty-eight percent of patients had some handicap in at least one domain, and 23 % had some handicap in all three domains. Seven percent of patients had severe or significant handicap in all three domains. Conclusions: A considerable proportion of patients with unilateral VS have hearing, tinnitus, and dizziness handicap.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionAlthough {{cerebral}} {{small vessel}} {{disease is a}} significant contributor {{to the development of}} imbalance and falls in the elderly, whether it causes dizziness is not known. MethodsA retrospective case analysis was conducted for 122 dizzy patients referred to two <b>neuro-otology</b> tertiary centres in London and Pisa. Patients were divided into ‘explained’ causes of dizziness (e. g. benign positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, orthostatic hypotension, cerebellar ataxias) and ‘unexplained’ dizziness. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) in MRI (T 2 weighted and FLAIR sequences) were blindly rated according to the Fazekas scale. Results 122 patients; 58 (mean age= 72, SD= 7. 95 years) in the ‘unexplained’ group and 64 (mean age= 72. 01, SD= 8. 28 years) in the ‘explained’ group were recruited. The overall frequency of lesions (Fazekas 1 – 3) significantly differed between groups (p= 0. 011). The frequency of severe lesions (Fazekas 3) was significantly higher in the ‘unexplained’ group (22 %) than in the ‘explained’ group (5 %; p= 0. 003). ConclusionIncreased severity of WMH in cases of unexplained dizziness suggests that such abnormalities are likely contributory to the development of dizziness. WM lesions may induce dizziness either because patients perceive a degree of objective unsteadiness or by a disconnection syndrome involving vestibular or locomotor areas of the brain...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMénière’s {{disease is}} a {{frequent}} vestibular disease that occurs predominantly in the fourth decade of life. Diagnosis is mostly medical {{and is based on}} findings of vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness. Aim: To study the clinical findings of Ménière’s disease: age, duration of vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss and aural fullness, and unilateral or bilateral involvement. Method: a retrospective study included 39 patients with a diagnosis of Ménière’s disease confirmed by electrocochleography, who were seen at a <b>neuro-otology</b> referral centre. Patients underwent a clinical examination, audiometry and bilateral transtympanic electrocochleography. Patients were separated into 2 groups: bilateral Ménière’s disease and unilateral Ménière’s disease. Results: The mean age was 42. 9 years; 72. 5 % were female. Fluctuation of hearing loss occurred in 54. 5 % of cases, and 65. 7 % had frequent attacks of vertigo. Bilateral disease was observed in 33. 3 %. The onset of the disease was earlier in the bilateral group (33. 7 years) compared to the unilateral group (p= 0. 0013). Duration of disease, tinnitus, hearing loss and aural fullness were similar between groups. Conclusion: Patients with bilateral Ménière’s disease had symptoms earlier than patients with unilateral disease.

40|$|Cerebellar stroke is {{a common}} cause of a {{vascular}} vestibular syndrome. Although vertigo ascribed to cerebellar stroke is usually associated with other neurological symptoms or signs, it may mimic acute peripheral vestibulopathy (APV), so called pseudo-APV. The most common pseudo-APV is a cerebellar infarction in {{the territory of the}} medial branch of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). Recent studies have shown that a normal head impulse result can differentiate acute medial PICA infarction from APV. Therefore, physicians who evaluate stroke patients should be trained to perform and interpret the results of the head impulse test. Cerebellar infarction in the territory of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) can produce a unique stroke syndrome in that it is typically accompanied by unilateral hearing loss, which could easily go unnoticed by patients. The low incidence of vertigo associated with infarction involving the superior cerebellar artery distribution may be a useful way of distinguishing it clinically from PICA or AICA cerebellar infarction in patients with acute vertigo and limb ataxia. For the purpose of prompt diagnosis and adequate treatment, it is imperative to recognize the characteristic patterns of the clinical presentation of each cerebellar stroke syndrome. This paper provides a concise review of the key features of cerebellar stroke syndromes from the <b>neuro-otology</b> viewpoint.

40|$|CONCLUSION: Chronic {{subjective}} dizziness (CSD) is {{frequent and}} affects {{twice as many}} women as men. Anxiety is a strong predisposing factor. The pathophysiologic concept of this disorder assumes that balance function and emotion share common neurologic pathways, which might explain that the balance disorder can provoke fear and vice versa, giving rise to a problem in perception of space and motion. In anxious patients this can turn into a space and motion phobia, with avoidance behaviour. OBJECTIVE: CSD is a diagnosis based on the hypothesis of an interaction between the vestibular system and the psychiatric sphere. Patients complain of chronic imbalance, worsened by visual motion stimulation, and frequently suffer from anxiety. Vestibular examination reveals no anomalies. We evaluated the incidence and characteristics of CSD in patients referred to our <b>neuro-otology</b> centre (tertiary hospital outpatient clinic). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 1552 consecutive patients presenting with vertigo. CSD was diagnosed in 164 patients (female:male= 111 : 53). RESULTS: CSD represents 10. 6 % of the dizzy patients in our clinic. Psychiatric disorder, mainly anxiety, was found in 79. 3 % of the cases. Other frequently associated factors were fear of heights and former vestibular lesion (healed). In all, 79. 0 % of the patients with CSD had poor balance performance on dynamic posturography testing...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} under-diagnosed neuro-otological {{disorders and}} {{to evaluate whether}} under-diagnosing depends on {{the age of the}} patient. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical charts from 951 consecutive patients (685 under and 266 above the age of 65 years) who entered diagnostic procedures at the Interdisciplinary Center for Vertigo and Balance Disorders, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. Final diagnoses were compared to referral diagnoses. RESULTS: Relative to referral diagnoses, the proportion of patients finally diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) almost doubled both in younger (< 65 year from 12. 7 % to 25. 1 %) and older patients (from 20. 7 % to 37. 6 %). Striking relative increases were found for the diagnoses multisensory dizziness in older patients (from 20. 7 % to 37. 6 %) and vestibular migraine in younger patients (1. 8 % to 20. 2 %). In both age groups, the proportion of patients with undetermined diagnoses was reduced by about 60 % (younger: 69. 8 % to 9. 8 %; older: 69. 2 % to 12. 4 %) by the diagnostic procedures in the vertigo center. These changes were all significant (p < 0. 05) in McNemar tests with continuity correction (2 x 2 tables: focused diagnosis vs. other diagnoses, referral vs. final). CONCLUSION: Significant changes of diagnoses can be expected by a specialized neuro-otological work-up. In particular, BPPV, multisensory dizziness, and vestibular migraine are under-diagnosed by referring physicians. This finding calls for better education of primary care takers in the field of <b>neuro-otology...</b>|$|E
40|$|The mouse is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used animal model in biomedical research because of recent advances in molecular genetic techniques. Studies related to eye movement in mice are common in fields such as ophthalmology relating to vision, <b>neuro-otology</b> relating to the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), neurology relating to the cerebellum's role in movement, and psychology relating to attention. Recording eye movements in mice, however, is technically difficult. We developed a new algorithm for analyzing the three-dimensional (3 D) rotation vector of eye movement in mice using high-speed video-oculography (VOG). The algorithm made it possible to analyze the gain and phase of VOR using the eye's angular velocity around the axis of eye rotation. When mice were rotated at 0. 5 Hz and 2. 5 Hz around the earth's vertical axis with their heads in a 30 ° nose-down position, the vertical components of their left eye movements were in phase with the horizontal components. The VOR gain was 0. 42 at 0. 5 Hz and 0. 74 at 2. 5 Hz, and the phase lead of the eye movement against the turntable was 16. 1 ° at 0. 5 Hz and 4. 88 ° at 2. 5 Hz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of this algorithm being used to calculate a 3 D rotation vector of eye movement in mice using high-speed VOG. We developed a technique for analyzing the 3 D rotation vector of eye movements in mice with a high-speed infrared CCD camera. We concluded that the technique is suitable for analyzing eye movements in mice. We also include a C++ source code that can calculate the 3 D rotation vectors of the eye position from two-dimensional coordinates of the pupil and the iris freckle in the image to this article...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{review the}} symptoms, signs, and {{clinical}} findings {{in a large}} series of patients diagnosed with unilateral sporadic vestibular schwannoma (VS) to describe the clinical characteristics of tinnitus in this population. Further, to ascertain which of the proposed mechanisms of tinnitus generation in VS was supported. Design: Retrospective case note and database review. Setting: Tertiary university teaching hospital departments of audiology and <b>neuro-otology.</b> Participants: Nine hundred forty-one patients with unilateral sporadic VS, diagnosed during the period 1986 to 2002. Twenty-three additional patients were excluded due to missing clinical data. Main outcome measures: The {{presence or absence of}} tinnitus, and its rated subjective severity were analyzed in conjunction with data regarding patient demographics, symptoms, signs, and diagnostic audiovestibular test findings. Results: No statistical association at the 5 % level was found between tinnitus presence/absence and patient age, gender, 2 - to 4 -kHz audiometric thresholds, ipsilateral auditory brainstem response abnormality, length of history, tumor side, nor caloric test abnormality. Statistically significant associations were found between tinnitus presence/absence and tumor size (p[*]=[*] 0. 012) and type of hearing loss (progressive, sudden, fluctuant, nil) with a tendency for patients without hearing loss to be less likely to experience tinnitus. Statistically significant associations were identified between classification of tinnitus severity and age at diagnosis (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) (greater age being associated with greater tinnitus severity), abnormal findings on caloric testing (p[*]=[*] 0. 01) (abnormal calorics being associated with greater tinnitus severity), and tinnitus as a principal presenting symptom (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) (this being associated with greater tinnitus severity). Conclusions: The analysis does not identify any single one of the proposed mechanisms for tinnitus as being the obvious culprit. In fact, even in a homogeneous group of patients such as this, there is evidence of multiple mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive. The association between increased tinnitus severity in older patients, patients with canal pareses on caloric testing, and with tinnitus as a principal presenting symptom should be borne in mind by the clinician...|$|E
40|$|Background: Balance {{problems}} {{are caused by}} multiple factors and often lead to falls and related fractures, bringing large socio-economic costs. The complexity of balance control mechanisms, the lack of medical expertise, {{and the absence of}} specialised equipment contribute to the delayed or incorrect diagnosis and management ofthese patients. Advances in computer science have allowed the development of computer systems that support clinical diagnosis and treatment decisions based on individualised patient data. The aim of the EMBalance decision support system (DSS) is to support doctors facing this clinical challenge, to make a definitive diagnosis and implement an effective management plan. The EMBalance study will determine the accuracy of this supportive tool when used by non-specialist doctors. This study is funded by the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme. Methods/design: EMBalance is a proof-of-concept study designed as a non-commercial, international, multi-centre, single-blind, parallel-group randomised controlled trial to be carried out at four clinical sites in the United Kingdom, Germany, Greece and Belgium. The study is comprised of three stages: internal pilot, phase I (diagnosis) and stage II (management). For this purpose, 200 patients presenting with persistent dizziness (> 3 months’ duration) to primary care services will be randomised to either the intervention group (diagnostic assessment with the DSS) or a control group (diagnostic assessment without the DSS). Patients allocated to the intervention group will be assessed by a doctor {{with the support of the}} EMBalance DSS, while patients allocated to the control group will receive a visit as per standard practice. Ultimately, all patients’ diagnoses and management plans will be certified by a consultant in <b>neuro-otology.</b> Discussion: EMBalance is the first trial to test the accuracy of a DSS in both the diagnosis of and the management plan for vestibular disorders across the healthcare systems of four different countries. The EMBalance study is the result of a combined effort of engineers and physicians to develop an accurate tool to support non-specialist doctors, with no risk for the patient.
