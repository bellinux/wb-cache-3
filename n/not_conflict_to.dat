40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{software support}} for non-blocking transactions in shared-memory multiprocessors. We present mechanisms that convert sequential transactions into lock-free or wait-free ones. In contrast to some previous mechanisms, ours support transactions {{for which the}} set of memory locations accessed cannot be determined in advance. Our implementations automatically detect and resolve conflicts between concurrent transactions, and allow transactions that do <b>not</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>to</b> execute in parallel. The key to the efficiency of our wait-free implementation lies in using a lock-free (but not wait-free) multi-word compareand -swap (MWCAS) operation. By introducing communication between a high-level helping mechanism and the lock-free MWCAS, we show that an expensive wait-free MWCAS {{is not necessary to}} ensure wait-freedom. 1 Introduction The use of locking to coordinate accesses to shared data in multiprocessor applications has a number of associated pitfalls including a lack of concur [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The punctuated {{equilibrium}} model of group {{activity and the}} positive task conflict‐performance relationship are prominent in the team literature; however, their respective underlying concepts, team approach and ideas‐task complexity fit have been neglected. The first aim of the paper is to introduce these concepts, show how these underlie the two theories, and how they might be linked together in a novel way. The second aim is to illustrate {{the value of these}} ideas {{through the use of a}} case study of three teams working separately on an identical software engineering project. Design/methodology/approach – The performance, conflict levels, approaches and ideas of three teams working on an identical software project are compared. The data were largely collected by observation of all the teams' meetings. Findings – The findings show that the team approach and ideas‐task complexity fit are significant in determining performance. It is also found that ideas emerge as frequently outside of conflict as in it and that the team's approach shapes conflict, not vice versa. Though the team with the most conflict performed best, it was differences in approach and the matching of the variety of ideas (<b>not</b> <b>conflict)</b> <b>to</b> task complexity that was important. Conflict in the teams reflected the approach, influencing its execution more than its development. Practical implications – The research highlights the importance of initial meetings and the need to consider the team approach concept in teamwork training. Originality/value – The paper re‐emphasises the significance of Gersick's conception of team approach and the importance of the level of ideas fitting the complexity of the task, which is itself shaped by the approach; the case study makes a valuable contribution as it focuses on teams conducting an identical project for a single client...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} Daniel Mookhey argues that Australia is {{splitting}} into three economies, which are increasingly inequitable, and unnecessarily adversarial. Government needs to encourage consensus, <b>not</b> <b>conflict,</b> <b>to</b> ensure Australia’s ongoing prosperity. The {{notion of a}} multitrack economy in Australia has become clichéd: ‘two-speed’, ‘patchwork’ – there’s {{no end to the}} labels bandied around. But what do any of these economies actually look like? Let’s borrow a taxonomy from Melbourne University’s Max Corden. Corden describes three economies in Australia: the Booming Tradable Sector, the Lagging Tradable Sector and the Non-Tradable Sector. The Tradable Sector produces goods and services that can be produced or consumed anywhere. Think of Apple’s iPad: it is designed in Cupertino, California; manufactured in Guangdong, China; but used everywhere. In contrast, the Non-Tradable Sector produces goods or services that must be both produced and consumed domestically. Think of your local hospital: its services can only be produced and consumed on site. Using this taxonomy, we’ve set out to analyse who works in which sector, and how fast each is growing – in aggregate, employment numbers, and wages. We have found that over the ten years to 2011, output and wages grew faster {{in most parts of the}} Tradable Sector, but employment grew faster in the Non-Tradable Sector. This means that an already unbalanced economy became even more unbalanced: the Booming Tradable Sector created more wealth but split it amongst fewer people, while the Non-Tradable Sector produced comparatively less new wealth but shared it amongst many more people. This partially explains why Australians read about record profits in some sectors, but job losses in others; record investments in production, but parsimonious spending on consumption; fast economic growth in the mining states, but slower economic growth in the other states. They are reading about three different economies...|$|E
