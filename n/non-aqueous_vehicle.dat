40|$|Changes in the {{structural}} properties of ethyl cellulose/propylene glycol dicaprylate systems (EC/PGD), intended for topical drug delivery, upon addition of water were investigated. Although {{designed to be}} a <b>non-aqueous</b> <b>vehicle</b> for moisture sensitive drugs, these systems are expected to experience an aqueous environment during production, storage and application on the skin. Hence, the interaction of water molecules with the non aqueous gel system and their distribution within the gel network is of interest and critical to its application. Experimental techniques of this study were small-deformation dynamic oscillation in shear, modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC), 2 H NMR spectroscopy, ATR-infrared spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns and light microscopy...|$|E

40|$|Hydrophilic ionic {{drugs can}} be {{rendered}} lipophilic by ion-pair formation with hydrophobic counter-ions. This study examines {{the value of}} forming ion pairs between anionic salicylate {{and a series of}} amines as model cationic counter-ions to facilitate topical delivery and skin penetration. The in-vitro translocation of salicylate ions from a <b>non-aqueous</b> <b>vehicle</b> through human epidermis was estimated in {{the presence or absence of}} amines, The distribution into, and accumulation of the salicylate ion in various tissues following topical application to anaesthetised rats were also investigated. Although the epidermal permeation constants of the salicylate-amine ion pairs were lower than that of salicylate itself (enhancement ratios: 0. 74 - 0. 87), salicylate retention and localisation in the underlying rat tissues increased in the presence of some of the counterions studied. Salicylate concentrations (mu g (g tissue) (- 1)) in the dermis were 877. 2 +/- 78. 6 for salicylate alone and 1098 +/- 121. 9 +/- 2586 +/- 332. 5 for salicylate-amine ion pairs. The levels of salicylate in tissues up to the top muscle layer were 1. 2 - 3. 7 -fold higher in the presence of the counter-ions. It is concluded that, although amine counter-ions have the ability to influence the penetration of salicylate, in-vitro permeability studies do not reflect the in-vivo increases in tissue concentrations resulting from probable changes in systemic clearance...|$|E

Objective: In the present investigation self microemulsifying drugdelivery system (SMEDDS) of Fexofenadine hydrochloride was developed forimproving solubility and dissolution rate of drug. Material Method: Solubility of Fexofenadine hydrochloride wasdetermined in various <b>non-aqueous</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as oils, surfactants, andco-surfactants. Psuedoternary phase diagrams were constructed to identify theself-micro emulsification region. Four formulations of SMEDDS were selected fromthe optimum concentration of oils, surfactant, and co-surfactants from psuedoternary diagrams. Resultsand Discussion: Selected formulations were evaluated for droplet size,in-vitro drug dissolution, drug content and solubility of drug. The optimumformulation was 20 % oleic acid, 26. 3 % ACONON MC 8 and 53. 3 % PEG 400. Self-microemulsification with the combination of oleic acid and ACONON MC 8 was foundhigher.

Rabbits were allowed to awaken and were examined for CFUs as a function of exposure time. In vitro, GML Gel was bactericidal for all broth culture and biofilm organisms in < 1 hour and < 4 hour, respectively; no CFUs were detected after the entire 24 h test period. In vivo, GML Gel inhibited bacterial growth in the surgical incision sites, compared to no growth inhibition in controls. GML Gel significantly reduced inflammation, as viewed by lack of redness in and below the incision sites. Our findings suggest that 5 % GML Gel is useful as a potent topical antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agent for prevention of infections...|$|E
40|$|For {{drugs with}} {{intrinsically}} low water solubility, effective intestinal absorption after oral administration remains a challenge. Molecular dispersion {{of a drug}} is, in almost all cases, an essential determinant of absorption across biological membranes and drugs must be dissolved in the gastrointestinal (GI) fluids in order {{to pass through the}} absorptive cells lining the small intestine (enterocytes). The solubility of a drug in aqueous medium is thus crucial for absorption and bioavailability. In spite of this requirement, recent estimates suggest that up to 70 % of drug candidates are classified as poorly water soluble. Poor oral bioavailability resulting from insufficient aqueous solubility and low dissolution rate is therefore a significant issue in the pharmaceutical industry. Lipid-based formulations (LBF) are one means by which the absorption of poorly water soluble drugs (PWSD) may be enhanced. LBF commonly comprise an isotropic combination of oils, surfactants and co-solvents that are designed to emulsify spontaneously in the GI environment. These Self-Emulsifying Drug Delivery Systems (SEDDS) improve the oral bioavailability of PWSD by pre-dissolving drugs in the <b>non-aqueous</b> <b>vehicle</b> (thereby avoiding traditional dissolution) and seek to maintain drug solubilisation whilst the formulation is dispersed and digested in the GI tract. Whilst this approach has proven successful, one significant limitation to utility is the requirement for the prospective drug dose to dissolve completely in the formulation. Many PWSD are relatively poorly soluble in lipids and this inherently limits the application of LBF technology. The current project explores two approaches to promote PWSD absorption using LBF by applying ionic liquids (ILs) to enhance LBF utility. Firstly, novel ILs were synthesized to generate excipients with very high solvent capacities for drug molecules that are poorly water soluble and also insufficiently soluble to be administered in LBF. To this end, water-immiscible ILs were synthesised and employed as a lipid substitute in SEDDS formulation and evaluated for their ability as drug carriers. Lipid-like ILs exhibited very high solvent properties (20 - 500 fold) for the poorly water-soluble drugs danazol and itraconazole when compared with soybean oil, a common lipid excipient. Subsequent in vivo evaluation in rats, revealed that a danazol-containing self-emulsifying IL formulation gave rise to higher (4. 3 -fold) exposure than a suspension of crystalline drug and more prolonged exposure when compared with a standard LBF. Secondly, PWSD were directly transformed into lipophilic ILs using a range of lipophilic counterions. The drug-IL so formed displayed remarkably higher solubility in LBF and allowed for excellent drug absorption from LBF at very high drug doses. The weakly basic, PWSDs itraconazole, cinnarizine and halofantrine were initially converted into lipophilic ILs to facilitate incorporation into LBF. The resultant active pharmaceutical ingredient – ionic liquids (API-ILs) were liquids or low melting point solids at room temperature and either completely miscible or highly soluble in lipid-based SEDDS. They also readily incorporated into the colloids formed in intestinal fluids during lipid digestion. In vivo, itraconazole docusate or cinnarizine decylsulfate ILs in SEDDS provided for significantly higher plasma exposure (2 -fold for cinnarizine and 20 -fold for itraconazole), when compared to lipid suspension formulations of the free base at the same dose. The data suggest that the formation of lipophilic ionic liquids provides a means of increasing dissolved-drug loading in lipid based formulations thereby promoting the exposure of poorly water soluble drugs after oral administration. The second approach was also applied to the weakly acidic, PWSDs tolfenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, diclofenac and ibuprofen. In a similar fashion, pairing of the crystalline acidic drugs with lipophilic counterions resulted in the formation of low melting point solid or liquid API-ILs, which were highly soluble or completely miscible in LBF. In vivo, oral administration of IL forms of tolfenamic acid resulted in similar total exposure to LBF containing suspensions of the free acid form of tolfenamic acid, but interestingly, reduced the peak plasma concentration and significantly extended the period of exposure for up to 48 h. In summary, the current studies suggest that customized ILs offer great promise as novel delivery vehicles for PWSD. Water-immiscible ILs provide potential as novel excipients significantly enhancing drug solubility in lipid formulations and enhancing and sustaining drug exposure after oral administration. Second, lipophilic IL forms of PWSD offer a novel strategy to increase oral exposure via increasing drug incorporation into LBF. The liquid SEDDS formulations, made possible by the use of the API-ILs, promote drug absorption for PWSD and also deliver advantages in dose uniformity, capsule filling and stability compared to similar suspension formulations...|$|E
