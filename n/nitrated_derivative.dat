40|$|The {{signaling}} pathway of nitric oxide (NO) depends mainly on guanosine 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP, 1). Here we report {{the formation and}} chemical biology of a <b>nitrated</b> <b>derivative</b> of cGMP, 8 -nitroguanosine 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (8 -nitro-cGMP, 2), in NO-mediated signal transduction. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated marked 8 -nitro-cGMP production in various cultured cells in an NO-dependent manner. This finding was confirmed by HPLC plus electrochemical detection and tandem mass spectrometry. 8 -Nitro-cGMP activated cGMP-dependent protein kinase and showed unique redox-active properties independent of cGMP activity. Formation of protein Cys-cGMP adducts by 8 -nitro-cGMP {{was identified as a}} new post-translational modification, which we call protein S-guanylation. 8 -Nitro-cGMP seems to regulate the redox-sensor signaling protein Keap 1, via S-guanylation of the highly nucleophilic cysteine sulfhydryls of Keap 1.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is a {{ubiquitous}} signaling molecule {{involved in}} diverse physiological processes, including plant senescence and stomatal closure. The NO and cyclic GMP (cGMP) cascade {{is the main}} NO signaling pathway in animals, but whether this pathway operates in plant cells, and the mechanisms of its action, remain unclear. Here, we assessed {{the possibility that the}} nitrated cGMP derivative 8 -nitro-cGMP functions in guard cell signaling. Mass spectrometry and immunocytochemical analyses showed that abscisic acid and NO induced the synthesis of 8 -nitro-cGMP in guard cells in the presence of reactive oxygen species. 8 -Nitro-cGMP triggered stomatal closure, but 8 -bromoguanosine 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (8 -bromo-cGMP), a membrane-permeating analog of cGMP, did not. However, in the dark, 8 -bromo-cGMP induced stomatal opening but 8 -nitro-cGMP did not. Thus, cGMP and its <b>nitrated</b> <b>derivative</b> play different roles in the signaling pathways that lead to stomatal opening and closure. Moreover, inhibitor and genetic studies showed that calcium, cyclic adenosine- 5 ′-diphosphate-ribose, and SLOW ANION CHANNEL 1 act downstream of 8 -nitro-cGMP. This study therefore demonstrates that 8 -nitro-cGMP acts as a guard cell signaling molecule and that a NO/ 8 -nitro-cGMP signaling cascade operates in guard cells. ...|$|E

HOCl and the myeloperoxidase-H 2 O 2 -halide system can modify both protein and lipid moieties of LDL and react with unsaturated phospholipids to form chlorohydrins. We investigated the proinflammatory effects of 1 -stearoyl- 2 -oleoyl- sn - 3 -glycerophosphocholine (SOPC) chlorohydrin on artery segments and spleen-derived leukocytes from ApoE -/- and C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. Treatment of ApoE -/- artery segments with SOPC chlorohydrin, but not unmodified SOPC, caused increased leukocyte-arterial adhesion in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. This could be prevented by pretreatment of the artery with P-selectin or ICAM- 1 -blocking antibodies, but not anti-VCAM- 1 antibody, and immunohistochemistry showed that P-selectin expression was upregulated. However, chlorohydrin treatment of leukocytes did not increase expression of adhesion molecules LFA- 1 or PSGL- 1, but caused increased release of ROS from PMA-stimulated leukocytes by a CD 36 -dependent mechanism. The SOPC chlorohydrin-induced adhesion and ROS generation could be abrogated by pretreatment of the ApoE -/- mice with pravastatin or a <b>nitrated</b> <b>derivative,</b> NCX 6550. These findings suggest that phospholipid chlorohydrins formed in HOCl-treated LDL could contribute to the proinflammatory effects observed for this modified lipoprotein in vitro...|$|E

40|$|Neutrophils play a {{major role}} in acute {{inflammation}} by generating reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. Opioid peptides, including enkephalins, are present at inflammation sites. Neutrophils contribute to protect against inflammatory pain by releasing opioid peptides. In this investigation, the ability of human polymorphonuclear cells to induce oxidative and nitrative modifications of Leu-enkephalin has been investigated in vitro. Activated human neutrophils mediate the oxidation of Leu-enkephalin resulting in the production of dienkephalin. In the presence of nitrite at concentrations observed during inflammatory and infectious process (10 - 50 mu M), nitroenkephalin, a <b>nitrated</b> <b>derivative</b> of Leu-enkephalin, is additionally formed. The yield of nitroenkephalin increases with nitrite concentration and is significantly inhibited by the addition of catalase or 4 -aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH), a specific inhibitor of peroxidases. These results suggest that neutrophils induce nitration of Leu-enkephalin by a mechanism that is dependent on myeloperoxidase activity and hydrogen peroxide. Oxidative/nitrative modifications of Leu-enkephalin have been also evidenced when cells were treated with the NO-donor molecule, DEANO. The nitrated enkephalin has been examined for its effect on leukocyte functional responses. The data reveal that nitroenkephalin at micromolar concentrations inhibits superoxide anion generation and degranulation of azurophilic granules of human polymorphonuclear cells. Moreover, nitroenkephalin inhibits spontaneous apoptosis of neutrophils, as evaluated by measuring caspase- 3 activity. Collectively, our data indicate that the nitrated enkephalin attenuates neutrophil activation and promotes the short-term survival of these cells, suggesting a possible role of the nitrocompound in the efficiency and resolution of inflammatory processes...|$|E

The nitrated protein {{did not differ}} significantly in secondary structure from its native unmodified counterpart, as revealed by far-u. v. c. d. measurements. The effect of Ca 2 + on the modified protein was different from that on the native protein, e. g. addition of Ca 2 + resulted in a loss of helical content from 55 to 47 % with the native protein whereas Ca 2 + had no significant effect on the gross conformation of the <b>nitrated</b> <b>derivative.</b> Near-u. v. c. d. studies also indicated a very minimal effect on the tyrosine residue and this was also reflected in the u. v. -absorption difference spectrum. Polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis in the absence of SDS showed the nitrated S- 100 b to move faster in the presence of EDTA compared with the calcium-bound state, suggesting that the modified protein does bind Ca 2 + although it does not undergo a major conformational change in response to Ca 2 + addition. In contradistinction, Zn 2 + binding was not influenced by nitration, as demonstrated by aromatic c. d. and u. v. -difference spectroscopy.

Nevertheless, and although reduction of a nitro group into an amino group is a thermodynamically favorable reaction, the main 4 -nitrobenzoate degradation pathway used by these bacteria did not involve 4 -aminobenzoate as an intermediate. Rather strains PB 4 and SB 4 used the previously described partial reduction into 4 -hydroxylaminobenzoate, subsequently converted into protocatechuate. Remarkably, both microorganisms also harbored a mutase, through which two dead-end metabolites, 3 -hydroxy- 4 -aminobenzoate and 3 -hydroxy- 4 -acetamidobenzoate, were produced. Regulation of the pathways appeared to differ in both strains. In strain PB 4. both 4 -nitro-and 4 -aminobenzoate were able to induce their own degradation {{as well as the}} degradation of the corresponding aminated or <b>nitrated</b> <b>derivative.</b> On the other hand, when strain SB 4 was incubated with mixtures of 4 -nitro- and 4 -aminobenzoate, 4 -aminobenzoate strongly interfered with the degradation of 4 -nitrobenzoate, even when the nitro compound was the inducer. Since aminoaromatic compounds are common co-contaminants of nitroaromatic-polluted sites, bacteria such as strains PB 4 and SB 4, which can mineralize both a nitroaromatic compound and its corresponding amino derivative, are relevant subjects of investigation in the interest of a complete site remediation.

40|$|International audienceReactivity of {{polycyclic}} aromatic compounds (PACs) adsorbed {{on natural}} aerosol particles exposed to different atmospheric oxidants (O 3, OH and NO 2 /O 3 mixture) was studied. Decay of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and formation/decay of oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs) and nitrated PAHs (NPAHs) were monitored. Overall, benzo[a]pyrene {{appeared to be the}} most reactive PAH (degradation of 50 %). Only its <b>nitrated</b> <b>derivative,</b> 6 -nitrobenzo[a]pyrene, was significantly formed explaining just 0. 4 % of reacted benzo [a]pyrene. No other nitrated or oxygenated benzo[a]pyrene derivatives were detected. Interestingly, B[e]P and In[1, 2, 3,c,d]P, which are usually considered as quite stable PAHs, also underwent decay in all experiments. In presence of O 3, ketones were significantly formed but their amount was not totally explained by decay of parent PAH. These results suggest that PAH derivatives could be formed from the reaction of other compounds than their direct parent PAHs and raise the question to know if the oxidation of methyl-PAHs, identified in vehicle-exhausts, could constitute this missing source of OPAHs. NPAHs were significantly formed in presence of O 3 /NO 2 and OH. Surprisingly, NPAH formation was clearly observed during O 3 experiments. Nitrated species, already associated with aerosol particles (NO 3 -, NO 2 -) or formed by ozonation of particulate nitrogen organic matter, could react with PAHs to form NPAHs. Heterogeneous formation of 2 -nitropyrene from pyrene oxidation was for the first time observed, questioning its use as an indicator of NPAH formation in gaseous phase. Equally, formation of 2 -nitrofluoranthene by heterogeneous reaction of fluoranthene with O 3 /NO 2 was clearly shown, while only its formation by homogeneous processes (gaseous phase) is reported in the literature.

40|$|Accelerated osteoclastic bone {{resorption}} {{plays an}} important role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and other common bone diseases such as Paget’s disease of bone, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer-associated bone disease.   The prevention and treatment of these diseases is based on agents that inhibit osteoclast (OC) formation and resorption. Nitrated non-steroidal anti-flammatory drugs (NO-NSAID) are a recently developed group of compounds that contain a conventional NSAID linked to a nitric oxide (NO) -donor group.   As prostaglandins and NO can both stimulate and inhibit OC formation and bone resorption, I investigated whether NO-NSAD may affect the bone loss observed in bone diseases. Both Flurbiprofen and its <b>nitrated</b> <b>derivative</b> NO-Flurbiprofen (HCT 1026) inhibit IL- 1 -stimulated OC formation and resorption in mouse co-cultures. However, HCT 1026 was much more potent than the parent compound Flurbiprofen. As resorption was completely blocked by HCT 1026 even though there were still OC present, I studied the effect of this drug on actin ring formation as an indicator of OC activity HCT 1026 significantly decreased the percentage of active OC within 4 hours and all actin rings had disappeared after 24 hours, whereas Flurbiprofen had no effects. HCT 1027, a HCT 1026 derivative that lacks the NO-donor properties, was a potent inhibitor of OC formation and resorption in both murine and human cultures. The fact that HCT 1027 and HCT 1026 were equipotent clearly demonstrates that the anti-resorptive effects of these compounds are not dependent on NO-donor properties.   Both HCT 1026 and HCT 1027 were potent inducers of apoptosis in OC and J 774 cells as evidenced by numbers of apoptotic nuclei and caspase- 3 activation.   Treatment of primary osteoblasts (OB) with HCT 1026 for up to 72 hours failed to induce OB apoptosis, suggesting that this compound acts only on cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage such as macrophages and OC. Intraperitoneal injection with ABD 56 (10 mg/kg/day) completely prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice and maintained BMD at level comparable to those of non-ovariectomised Sham controls. Histomorphometrical analysis of the proximal tibial metaphysis indicated that ABD 56 totally recovered ovariectomy-induced trabecular bone loss and significantly decreased OC number in both Sham- and ovariectomy-operated mice, whereas it had not significant effects on OB numbers. In conclusion, we successfully developed a novel class of anti-resorptive drugs using structure-based drug design.   The non-nitrated biphenyl carboxylic acid derivatives ABD 56 and ABD 68 are presented here as anti-resorptive agents that inhibit osteoclast formation, survival and resorption by a mechanism that is independent of NO production, COX inhibition and formation of metabolites.   ABD 56 prevents ovariectomy-induced bone loss and induces apoptosis in mature OC in vitro by inhibiting NF kB and p 42 / 44 activity.   Although its exact mechanism of action is yet unclear, ABD 56 is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of bone diseases associated with accelerated bone loss due to osteoclast activation such as osteoporosis, RA and cancer associated bone disease.

We discuss the role of implantable defibrillators in secondary prevention in light of three recent cases managed in our departments and a review of the literature. An implantable defibrillator was implanted in two of the three cases of vasospastic angina with ventricular arrhythmias that we managed.

Because a crosstalk exists between nitric oxide (NO) and HO- 1 in promotion of cell survival under oxidative stress, we designed novel NO-releasing molecules also capable to induce HO- 1. Starting from curcumin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), two known HO- 1 inducers, the molecules were chemically modified by acylation with 4 -bromo-butanoyl chloride and 2 -chloro-propanoyl chloride, respectively, and then treated in the dark with AgNO 3 to obtain the <b>nitrate</b> <b>derivatives</b> VP 10 / 12 and VP 10 / 39.

Analysis of a range of polyNIMMO / HNF propellants has allowed development of a hypothesis for this family of propellant compositions over a range of temperatures. The data has indicated that the degradation of polyNIMMO / HNF propellants is a complex process involving a number of interrelated and interdependent reactions. It appears that a significantly different reaction scheme dominates at 80 °C compared to either 60 °C or 40 °C. The incorporation of a 1 % anhydrous sodium sulphite + 1 % pNMA mixed stabiliser system has shown promise for use in propellant formulations up to temperature of 80 °C. Some level of success in stabilisation has also been achieved using very high levels of pNMA within the propellant formulation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [125]- 128) The {{study of}} the chemistry of macrocycles and their complexes is a field encompassing goals as diverse as extraction, catalysis, and modeling of biological systems. The development of new macrocycles brings the possibility of achieving these goals that much closer. In this spirit, several new macrocycles and their complexes have been synthesized and characterized using X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, and spectroscopic techniques. The compounds studied include the <b>nitrated</b> <b>derivatives</b> of benzo- 15 -crown- 5 and dibenzo- 18 -crown- 6, methylene- 16 -crown- 5 and its complexes, and hexadentate Schiff base complexes of the lanthanides. Nitrobenzo- 15 -crown- 5, dinitrobenzo- 15 -crown- 5, dinitrodibenzo- 18 -crown- 6, and methylene- 16 -crown- 5 were investigated as possible synthetic precursors to more complex crowns. The three nitro-crowns and a sodium thiocyanate complex with nitrobenzo- 15 -crown- 5 were structurally investigated. The three nitro-crowns {{were found to be}} structurally similar to their parent compounds. The sodium thiocyanate complex was shown to be similar to sodium complexes of benzo- 15 -crown- 5. Methylene- 16 -crown- 5 complexes of sodium iodide and sodium nitrite were prepared and structurally characterized. A complex of dimethylene- 26 -crown- 8 with sodium iodide was structurally characterized {{in the course of this}} study as was a complex of cerium chloride heptahydrate with tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether. Schiff base complexes of the lanthanides were investigated as examples of compounds with interactions between hard metal cations and soft donors. Sulfur was used as the soft donor. The interactions between the lanthanides and imine donors found in Schiff base macrocycles have been shown to be surprisingly stable. This stability was used to increase the overall stability of the complex, to some degree compensating for the instability of the lanthanide sulfur interaction. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. The {{ability to}} {{construct}} C-N bonds {{is of great}} importance to organic chemists as exemplified by the vast number of natural products, pharmaceutical agents and fine chemicals that contain such linkages. An atom efficient C-N bond forming reaction namely hydroamination has attracted much interest to date due to its ability in forming amine, imine and enamine functionality. The scope of this project involved the attempted synthesis of a biologically active and nitrogen containing pyrrolizidine alkaloid isolated from cryptic thief ants and poison dart frogs namely 223 H (xenovenine). The method of hydroamination was utilized as the pivotal ring forming step and was established as being a valuable synthetic tool towards the construction of 223 H (xenovenine). The stereoselective synthesis resulted in the successful formation of ethyl (3 R) - 5 -heptyl- 3 -methyl- 2, 3 -dihydro-lH-pyrrolizine- 7 -carboxylate 74, a novel, and structurally analogous precursor to 223 H (xenovenine) over 10 synthetic steps from (S) -pyroglutamic acid. The following research also resulted in the synthesis of two other novel compounds namely ethyl 3 -[(2 R) - 2 -methyl- 5 -thioxotetrahydro-lH-pyrrol-l-yl]propanoate 86 and ethyl 3 -{(5 R) - 2 -[(E) - 2 -ethoxy- 2 -oxoethylidene]- 5 -methyltetrahydro-lH-pyrrol-l-yl}propanoate 87. A catalytic hydroamination study on the conversion of C-propargyl vinylogous amides into pyrroles demonstrated that transition metal salts of groups 11 and 12 serve as effective hydroamination catalysts. The oxide, acetate, chloride and <b>nitrate</b> <b>derivatives</b> of group 11 and 12 metals namely Cu(II), Ag(I), Zn(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II) were employed as potential hydroamination catalysts in the oxidation states provided. The Zn(II) catalyst series with the exception ZnO provided the greatest hydroamination yields under mild reaction conditions owing to their high Lewis acidities however the Ag(I) and Hg(II) catalyst series also provided excellent yields of product under more forcing reaction conditions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Despite the {{frequent}} use of antiplatelet medication (AM) in the elderly patients, very few studies have investigated its prescription. We describe AM prescription through retrospective study in ambulatory elderly patients. METHOD: All subjects aged over 80 years with a medical prescription delivered in March 2015 and affiliated to the Mutualite Sociale Agricole de Bourgogne. Subjects with prescriptions for AM were compared with those without. RESULTS: A total of 15141 ambulatory elderly patients (83 - 89 years, 61. 3 % of women) were included and 4412 (29. 14 %) had a prescription for AM. The latter were more frequently men than those without AM (43 % vs 36. 93 %, P<. 0001) and more frequently had chronic comorbidities (77. 24 % vs 64. 65 %, P<. 0001). Compared with ambulatory subjects without AM, those with AM more frequently had coronary heart disease (35. 15 % vs 14. 49 %), severe hypertension (30 % vs 25. 65 %), diabetes (27. 42 % vs 20. 64 %), peripheral arterial diseases (16. 28 % vs 5. 96 %) and disabling stroke (9 % vs 5. 56 % (all P<. 0001). In addition, they had more prescriptions of beta-blockers (45. 24 % vs 36. 90 %), angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitor (31. 35 % vs 25. 44 %), calcium channel blockers (33. 34 % vs 27. 90 %), <b>nitrate</b> <b>derivatives</b> (10. 6 % vs 6. 03 %) or hypolipidemic agents (HA; 49. 81 % vs 29. 72 %) (all P<. 0001) than those without AM. CONCLUSION: In this study, which is very interested for its size and the advanced age of the subjects, long-course AM was prescribed in one third of ambulatory elderly patients. Coronary heart disease, severe hypertension and diabetes were more frequent in AM subjects. However, the low percentage of declared strokes was surprising.

40|$|<b>Nitrated</b> <b>derivatives</b> of {{fatty acids}} (NO 2 -FA) are {{pluripotent}} cell-signaling mediators that display anti-inflammatory properties. Current understanding of NO 2 -FA signal transduction lacks {{insight into how}} or if NO 2 -FA are modified or metabolized upon formation or administration in vivo. Here the disposition and metabolism of nitro- 9 -cis-octadecenoic (18 : 1 -NO 2) acid was investigated in plasma and liver after intravenous injection in mice. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that no 18 : 1 -NO 2 or metabolites were detected under basal conditions, whereas administered 18 : 1 -NO 2 is rapidly adducted to plasma thiol-containing proteins and glutathione. NO 2 -FA are also metabolized via β-oxidation, with high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of liver lipid extracts of treated mice revealing nitro- 7 -cis-hexadecenoic acid, nitro- 5 -cis-tetradecenoic acid, and nitro- 3 -cis-dodecenoic acid and corresponding coenzyme A derivatives of 18 : 1 -NO 2 as metabolites. Additionally, {{a significant proportion of}} 18 : 1 -NO 2 and its metabolites are converted to nitroalkane derivatives by saturation of the double bond, {{and to a lesser extent}} are desaturated to diene derivatives. There was no evidence of the formation of nitrohydroxyl or conjugated ketone derivatives in organs of interest, metabolites expected upon 18 : 1 -NO 2 hydration or nitric oxide (•NO) release. Plasma samples from treated mice had significant extents of protein-adducted 18 : 1 -NO 2 detected by exchange to added β-mercaptoethanol. This, coupled with the observation of 18 : 1 -NO 2 release from glutathione- 18 : 1 -NO 2 adducts, supports that reversible and exchangeable NO 2 -FA-thiol adducts occur under biological conditions. After administration of [3 H] 18 : 1 -NO 2, 64 % of net radiolabel was recovered 90 min later in plasma (0. 2 %), liver (18 %), kidney (2 %), adipose tissue (2 %), muscle (31 %), urine (6 %), and other tissue compartments, and may include metabolites not yet identified. In aggregate, these findings show that electrophilic FA nitroalkene derivatives (a) acquire an extended half-life by undergoing reversible and exchangeable electrophilic reactions with nucleophilic targets and (b) are metabolized predominantly via saturation of the double bond and β-oxidation reactions that terminate at the site of acyl-chain nitration...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{methods of}} {{extraction}} were optimized to extract polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), their <b>nitrated</b> <b>derivatives</b> and heavy n-alkanes from a highly adsorptive particulate matter resulting from the combustion of diesel fuel in a diesel engine. This particular carbonaceous particulate matter, collected at high temperatures in cordierite diesel particulate filters (DPF), which are optimized for removing diesel particles from diesel engine exhaust emissions, appeared extremely refractory to extractions using the classical extracting conditions for these pollutants. In particular, the method of accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) is described in detail here. Optimization was performed through experimental design to understand the impact of each factor studied and the factors’ possible interactions on the recovery yields. The conventional extraction technique, i. e., Soxhlet extraction, was also carried out, {{but the lack of}} quantitative extractions led us to use a more effective approach: hot Soxhlet. It appeared that the extraction of the heaviest PAHs and nitroPAHs by either the optimized ASE or hot Soxhlet processes was far from complete. To enhance recovery yields, we tested original solvent mixtures of aromatic and heteroaromatic solvents. Thereafter, these two extraction techniques were compared to microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). In every case, the only solvent mixture that permitted quantitative extraction of the heaviest PAHs from the diesel soot was composed of pyridine and diethylamine, which has a strong electron-donor character. Conversely, the extraction of the nitrated PAHs was significantly improved by the use of an electron-acceptor solvent or by introducing a small amount of acetic acid into the pyridine. It was demonstrated that, for many desirable features, no single extraction technique stound out as the best: ASE, MAE or SFE could all challenge hot Soxhlet for favourable extractions. Consequently, the four optimized extraction techniques were performed to extract the naturally polluted diesel soot collected inside the DPF. Comparisons with the NIST standard reference material SRM 1650 b showed that the soot collected from the DPF contained 50 % fewer n-alkanes, and also markedly lower levels of PAHs (44 less concentrated) than SRM 1650 b, and that the ratio of nitroPAHs to PAHs was increased. These results were attributed to the high temperatures reached inside the particulate filter during sampling runs and to the contribution of the catalytic DPF to aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons abatement...|$|R

40|$|A {{non-destructive}} UV–Vis spectroscopic {{method to}} study the aging of nitrocellulose (NC) has been described. The method involves determining the change of absorbance with time of a dye mixed with NC in a thin film. During {{the aging of the}} NC two secondary and one primary CO–NO 2 groups at the anhydroglucopyranose (AHP) ring positions C 2, C 3 and C 6 undergo decomposition and this leads to NOx formation. The NOx nitrates the dye and the decrease in the concentration of the original un-nitrated dye is followed by UV–Vis spectroscopy. Thin films with uniform thickness were prepared on glass slides by casting solutions of NC in butanone containing an anthraquinone dye (SB 59) and dioctyl phthalate as a plasticiser. The colour of the films changed gradually from blue to red during accelerated thermal aging, in line with changes in the UV–Vis spectra of the dye and its <b>nitrated</b> <b>derivatives.</b> The reaction of the dye with NOx was monitored by periodically recording the absorption spectra of the films. The graphs of the logarithmic absorbance as function of aging time produced non-linear plots. However, splitting the data into three time intervals was found to give rise to three linear regions with three distinct rate constants. In an initial attempt at modelling, first order-rate constants were obtained from the gradients of the ‘ln(AS(0) /AS(t)) vs aging time’ plots. The Arrhenius expressions derived from the data for the three time intervals at 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C gave three activation energy values, which are seen to correspond to the homolytic breakdown of CO–NO 2 groups at the C 2, C 3 and C 6 ring positions on NC. In a further step, the data were evaluated with extended modelling using (i) a first order description, (ii) a second order description and (iii) an nth order description. This modelling considered the data as a whole; no splitting of data in time intervals and no single temperature evaluation has been made. Some differences can be recognized between the first order and second order models. However, the results from these evaluations agree satisfactorily {{with each other and with}} quantum chemical calculations of the bond dissociation enthalpies of the CO–NO 2 bonds at the three ring positions. In this way, the data could be assigned to the anhydroglucopyranose ring positions of the CO–NO 2 groups. Based on all data and literature results the order of stability of the CO–NO 2 groups was concluded to be C 6 > C 2 > C 3...|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{play an important}} role in urban air quality due to the toxic and carcinogenic hazard they present. A class of pollutants receiving increasing interest from researchers are oxygenated (OPAH) and <b>nitrated</b> (NPAH) <b>derivative</b> compounds. There is a need for an improved understanding of the sources, concentrations, behaviour and fate of these pollutants as they can pose a similar public health risk as PAHs and can enter the environment both from primary combustion emissions and secondary formation from atmospheric reactions. This study investigates the airborne concentrations of PAH, OPAH and NPAH compounds in U. K. atmosphere at heavily trafficked and urban background sites. Sampling campaigns were conducted to assess the spatial and temporal trends, primary and/or secondary sources, gas-particle phase partitioning and atmospheric degradation of PAHs, NPAHs and OPAHs. Differences in atmospheric concentrations between trafficked sites and the urban background site indicate a variable influence of road traffic emissions between different PAH, OPAH and NPAH compounds. Seasonal, diurnal and temporal patterns as well as positive matrix factorisation (PMF) source apportionment provide evidence of the key influencing factors governing the concentrations of PAHs, OPAHs and NPAHs in the urban atmosphere, in addition to the strength of road traffic emissions...|$|R
