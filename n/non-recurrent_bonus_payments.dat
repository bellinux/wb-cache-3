40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to compare through simulation Holstein and Jersey breed herds, considering the farm size, zootechnical and economic indexes and profitability of the activity, by using different systems of <b>bonus</b> <b>payment</b> for milk price based in percentage of fat and protein in the milk. The comparisons were made, initially, disregarding the <b>bonus</b> <b>payment</b> for milk price based on the increase in the fat and protein percentage in milk. After that, the profitability of the activity was compared considering <b>bonus</b> <b>payment</b> for milk price of the Jersey breed herd, for each unit increment in fat and protein percentage in milk above those obtained with the Holstein breed herd. Finally, the profitability of the activity was compared by using the <b>bonus</b> <b>payment</b> for milk price based on quality of that used by company A systems. When there was no <b>bonus</b> <b>payment</b> for milk price based in the percentage of fat and protein in the milk, the profit obtained with the Holstein breed was higher because of the lower production costs. In order to make the activity more profitable with the Jersey breed, a <b>bonus</b> <b>payment</b> of 5 % for milk price would be needed for each percentage unit of fat above the percentage of that obtained with the Holstein breed, or a <b>bonus</b> <b>payment</b> of 10 % in the milk price for each percentage unit of protein above the percentage obtained with the Holstein breed. By using the <b>bonus</b> <b>payment</b> system proposed by Gimenes and Ponchio, the annual profit with the Jersey breed was higher than the profit obtained with the Holstein breed. However, with the application of the <b>bonus</b> <b>payment</b> system used by company A, the Holstein breed became more profitable than the Jersey breed...|$|R

40|$|Promoting {{the use of}} {{renewable}} energy sources is a central goal of most industrialized countries. Up to today, fixed feed in tariffs are a commonly used support scheme. However, these have major disadvantages concerning market integration. Thus, more market-conforming solutions come into focus. One of these are <b>bonus</b> <b>payments.</b> Their fundamental characteristic is an augmented market price {{for the production of}} electricity from renewable energy sources. This paper takes {{a closer look at the}} mechanics of <b>bonus</b> <b>payments</b> in an environment of market power and negative externalities connected to conventional electricity supply. We analyze the market participants' behavior in a long-term context: Suppliers react to an augmented price by adapting their level of capacity. It is an important question whether a social optimum can be reached by means of <b>bonus</b> <b>payments</b> or whether welfare losses occur. We use a two-stage model. In the first stage the public sector implements the <b>bonus</b> <b>payment.</b> In the second stage, the suppliers engage in Cournot competition, choosing their profit maximizing level of capacity. We find that in this setting, <b>bonus</b> <b>payments</b> can strongly increase overall welfare. However, they do not prove to be superior instruments for the promotion {{of renewable}} energy as they, like fixed feed in tariffs have major disadvantages compared to more market conforming instruments.

In the extended model, wage competition between employers serves as a source of positive correlation between wages and <b>bonus</b> <b>payments</b> reported in a number of empirical studies.

We show that competition for high ability workers nevertheless leads firms to offer high <b>bonus</b> <b>payments,</b> thereby deliberately accepting pressure-induced performance reductions. <b>Bonus</b> <b>payments</b> allow for a separating equilibrium in which only high ability workers choose high-powered incentive contracts. Low ability workers receive fixed payments and produce their maximum output which, however, is still below the reduced output of high ability workers. <b>Bonus</b> <b>payments</b> lead to a social loss which is increasing {{in the degree of}} competition.
