500|$|The lyric [...] "Boy, you actinâ€™ so corny like Fritos" [...] {{generated}} {{a positive response}} from both critics and fans alike, with MTV News reporting that fans were [...] "freaking" [...] over it. Wass described the inclusion of Fritos as [...] "hilarious", while Camp likened it {{to a form of}} product placement. Billboard highlighted the juxtaposition between the chorus, [...] "Close the door/Lose the key/Leave my heart on the mat for me/I was yours eternally/There's an end to infinity" [...] and one of the verses, [...] "Name hold weight like kilos/Boy you actin' so corny like Fritos/Wouldn't have none of that without me, though/Ain't <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>business,</b> it's tea though/Outta ammo, gotta reload/If life was a game you're a free throw/It's nothing that you don't already know," [...] noting that the former is [...] "almost sweet" [...] compared to the latter.|$|E
500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>business</b> if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E

60|$|Such is the {{precipitant}} {{disposition of}} our people (whether it is so or not all over the world, that is <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> particular <b>business</b> to inquire; but I saw it apparently here), that, as upon the first sight of the infection they shunned one another, and fled from one another's houses and from the city with an unaccountable, and, as I thought, unnecessary fright, so now, upon this notion spreading, viz., that the distemper was not so catching as formerly, and {{that if it was}} catched it was not so mortal, and seeing abundance of people who really fell sick recover again daily, they took to such a precipitant courage, and grew so entirely regardless of themselves and of the infection, that they made no more of the plague than of an ordinary fever, nor indeed so much. They not only went boldly into company with those who had tumors and carbuncles upon them that were running, and consequently contagious, but eat and drank with them, nay, into their houses to visit them, and even, as I was told, into their very chambers where they lay sick.|$|R
