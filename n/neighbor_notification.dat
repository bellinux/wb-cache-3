40|$|Eleven {{issues of}} Volume 10 of Branching Out - An Integrated Pest Management Newsletter for Trees and Shrubs were {{published}} in 2003. The newsletter was sent to 650 subscribers and an additional 90 cooperators. Readers received timely information for identifying and managing {{a wide array of}} insect and disease problems on trees and shrubs. With more counties throughout the state adopting the New York State <b>Neighbor</b> <b>Notification</b> Law, timely information about pests and pest management options has become essential for the industry, and Branching Out {{is one of the few}} sources of such information...|$|E

The newsletter was sent to 712 subscribers and an additional 80 cooperators. Readers received timely information for identifying and managing {{a wide array of}} insect and disease problems on trees and shrubs. With this the first year of implementation of the New York State <b>Neighbor</b> <b>Notification</b> Law for pesticide applicators on Long Island and in several upstate counties, timely information about pests and pest management options was especially valuable...|$|E
40|$|Application-layer overlay {{networks}} have recently {{emerged as a}} promising solution for live media multicast on the Internet. A tree {{is probably the most}} natural structure for a multicast overlay, but is vulnerable in the presence of dynamic end-hosts. Data-driven approaches form a mesh out of overlay nodes to exchange data, which greatly enhances the resilience. It however suffers from an efficiency-latency tradeoff, given that the data have to be pulled from mesh <b>neighbors</b> with periodical <b>notifications.</b> In this paper, we suggest a novel hybrid tree/mesh design that leverages both overlays. The key idea is to identify a set of stable nodes to construct a tree-based backbone, called treebone, with most of the data being pushed over this backbone. These stable nodes, together with others, are further organized through an auxiliary mesh overlay, which facilitates the treebone to accommodate node dynamics and fully exploit the available bandwidth between overlay nodes. This hybrid design, referred to as mTreebone, is braced by our real trace studies, which show strong evidence that the performance of an overlay closely depends on a small set of backbone nodes. It however poses a series of unique and critical design challenges, in particular, the identification of stable nodes and seamless data delivery using both push and pull methods. In this paper, we present optimized solutions to these problems, which reconcile the two overlays under a coherent framework with controlled overhead. We evaluate mTreebone through both simulations and PlanetLab experiments. The results demonstrate the superior ef-∗ This work was mainly performed when Feng Wang was a visiting studen...|$|R
40|$|Good quality {{child care}} is {{extremely}} important for working families and NY has over a ½ million children enrolled in a child care program. Two laws have been put into place in NY {{with the intent of}} safeguarding for young children enrolled in child care centers, the Child Safe Playing Fields Act and the <b>Neighbor</b> <b>Notification</b> Law, yet the status of pests and pest management is unclear. In addition, pests and pest management are a minute part of what child care personnel think about each day in a child care business; however, when pest activity occurs (such as ants in food, mouse droppings in toy bins, head lice on children, or a wasp sting), pests can become the # 1 top priority of the day. Efforts to evaluate the pest management needs will help the NYS IPM Program develop tools to help child care staff prevent or handle pest issues while also protecting {{the health and safety of}} children and staff, assuring parents, and avoiding legal and financial liability for the business...|$|E
40|$|Good quality {{child care}} is {{extremely}} important for working families and NY State has over a half million children enrolled in child care programs. Two laws have been enacted in NY {{with the intent of}} safeguarding young children enrolled in child care centers, the Child Safe Playing Fields Act and the <b>Neighbor</b> <b>Notification</b> Law, yet the status of pests and pest management is unclear. In addition, pests and pest management are a small part of what child care personnel think about each day in a child care business; however, when pest activity occurs (such as ants in food, mouse droppings in toy bins, head lice on children, or a wasp sting), pests can become the top priority of the day. Good decision-making is possible through awareness. The objective of this project is to assess the awareness of child care business operators and managers of sound pest management practices and the pest issues they face. Through an online survey of center-based child care businesses and follow-up with site assessments, we aim to engage the child care industry to learn about the pest management challenges faced and to work toward awareness and solutions that protect children from pests and pesticides...|$|E
