5|$|Admiral Nimitz {{recommended}} to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that development {{and control of}} the base facilities be placed under SOPAC by extending its border westward to include the Admiralties. MacArthur was furious; the borders of SWPA could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> without the consent of the Australian government. Nimitz's proposal was eventually turned down by the Joint Chiefs but not before MacArthur restricted access to the facilities to ships of the United States Seventh Fleet and British Pacific Fleet. Halsey was summoned to MacArthur's headquarters in Brisbane on 3March 1944, and the two agreed to a compromise. Responsibility {{for the development of the}} base passed from Krueger's Alamo Force to Kinkaid's Allied Naval Forces on 18May 1944. It was proposed control would ultimately pass to SOPAC but it never did.|$|E
5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E
5|$|Several {{plantation}} {{owners in}} Hawaii favored {{the importation of}} coolie labor from the East India region. Henry A. P. Carter and British consul James Hay Wodehouse had already visited England in 1879 to open a door for the process. They were discouraged by stipulations that Hawaii {{would be forced to}} pass legislation that would in essence be a detailed labor contract. There was a further requirement that such a Hawaiian law could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> without the approval of the governments of both Great Britain and East India. The prospect was explored through the end of 1880, when Hawaii's immigration board decided the islands could not import Indian labor within the parameters required.|$|E

5|$|The {{advance to}} the Blackett design {{was the way the}} {{sighting}} head was aimed. Instead of dialling the parameters into the sight directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. The console was equipped with repeaters for each of the aircraft instruments needed to operate the sight, like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the dials on the console so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as laying needle on needle. This eliminated the possibility that the numbers would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual working that a new crew member was introduced to operate the console, the bomb-aimer's mate.|$|E
5|$|In 1065 Northumbria revolted against Tostig, and {{the rebels}} chose Morcar, {{the younger brother}} of Edwin, Earl of Mercia, as earl in place of Tostig. Harold, perhaps to secure the support of Edwin and Morcar in his bid for the throne, {{supported}} the rebels and persuaded King Edward to replace Tostig with Morcar. Tostig went into exile in Flanders, {{along with his wife}} Judith, who was the daughter of Count Baldwin IV of Flanders. Edward was ailing, and he died on 5 January 1066. It is unclear what exactly happened at Edward's deathbed. One story, deriving from the Vita Edwardi, a biography of Edward, claims that Edward was attended by his wife Edith, Harold, Archbishop Stigand, and Robert FitzWimarc, and that the king named Harold as his successor. The Norman sources do not dispute the fact that Harold was named as the next king, but they declare that Harold's oath and Edward's earlier promise of the throne could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> on Edward's deathbed. Later English sources stated that Harold had been elected as king by the clergy and magnates of England.|$|E
5|$|The {{service would}} {{ultimately}} have 21 landings, of which ten would be brand-new, five would be upgraded, and six would be preexisting landings that would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> {{with the addition}} of NYC Ferry routes. The existing East River Ferry landings at Brooklyn Bridge Park Pier 1; Schaefer Landing; North Williamsburg; Greenpoint; and Long Island City remained unchanged. There would be upgrades to the landings at Wall Street; East 34th Street; East 92nd Street; Brooklyn Army Terminal; and Brooklyn Bridge Park Pier 6. The remaining landings were built as part of the project. A stop on Governor's Island was implemented along one of the routes to South Brooklyn. At the time, Governor's Island Ferry, the only public access to the island, runs seasonally between May and September, but the proposed Governor's Island stop would feature ferry service year-round. It was decided to build the Rockaway dock at Beach 108th Street, but a second dock could not be built further east than Beach 84th Street due to height restrictions caused by the Rockaway Line subway bridge. Construction on the first dock, the Rockaway landing, began in January 2017.|$|E

25|$|Cassette {{playback}} {{suffered from}} some flaws frustrating to both professionals and home recording enthusiasts. Tape speed could vary between devices, resulting in pitch {{that was too}} low or too high. Speed often was calibrated at the factory, and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by users. The slow tape speed increased tape hiss and noise, and in practice delivered higher values of wow and flutter. Different tape formulation and noise reduction schemes artificially boosted or cut high frequencies and inadvertently elevated noise levels. Noise reduction also adds some artifacts to the sound, which a trained ear can hear sometimes quite easily.|$|E

Escherichia coli is a badly classified species as some strains share only 20% of their genome. Being so diverse it should be given a higher taxonomic ranking. However, due to the medical conditions associated with the species, it will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> to avoid confusion in medical context.|$|E
