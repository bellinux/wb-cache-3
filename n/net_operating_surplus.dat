40|$|Overview The Commonwealth government’s perilous {{financial}} position is well known, but the finances {{of state government}} also warrant our attention. In aggregate, since plunging heavily into deficit after 2007, the states’ fiscal position has improved markedly in recent years, marked by a return to <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surpluses,</b> much reduced fiscal deficits, and stabilization of net debt. Growth of operating expenses has been held below revenue growth. However, the aggregates mask major differences among the states. New South Wales was clearly in the strongest fiscal position in 2016, while Western Australia exhibited a sharp deterioration in several {{years leading up to}} 2016 and now suffers one of the weakest fiscal positions of all the states. The trend in other states was generally one of improvement in the three years to 2016, but South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania continue to exhibit weaknesses that set them apart from the stronger positions of New South Wales and Victoria. No state {{is in a position to}} be complacent and all of them need to keep a tight rein on operating expenses. Even New South Wales, as the strongest state, is vulnerable to an unexpected decline in property-related tax revenue and to risks associated with implementation of the state’s large infrastructure program...|$|R

40|$|Executive summary: While Commonwealth {{government}} debt {{has been the}} focus of attention recently, this report takes a broader view by bringing state debt into the picture. Much has been made of the fact that Commonwealth {{government debt}} is projected (under current expenditure and tax policies) to grow from $ 300 billion at June 2013 to more than $ 400 billion in 2016 – 17 — and keep growing. Over the same four years, net debt (after deducting certain financial assets) is expected to grow from $ 153 billion to $ 280 billion and then to $ 325 billion in 2018 – 19, at which point it will peak as a percentage of GDP. State debt has also risen dramatically since 2007, when net debt was negative. In the six years to 2013, states added $ 70 billion to their general government net debt to reach a positive level of $ 43 billion. Aggregate state debt is manageable at that level, but the upward trend is of concern—and more so in some states than others. By 2016 – 17, combined Commonwealth and state general government (GG) net debt will exceed $ 350 billion—almost 20 % of GDP, or more meaningfully, more than 50 % of general government revenue. The general government debt figures do not tell the full story. For the broader non-financial public sector (which includes non-financial public corporations), state net debt was much higher at $ 127 billion in 2013. Combined with the Commonwealth, total non-financial public sector net debt was $ 283 billion, already 50 % of the sector’s revenue. Public corporations’ debt is guaranteed by their government owners, but these corporations are better able to carry debt as their investments are supposed to be commercially viable. The above figures exclude non-debt financial liabilities such as unfunded superannuation and long-service leave liabilities. These loom large in state finances. When added to net debt, non-debt financial liabilities bring the 2013 total of net financial liabilities to $ 190 billion for state general government and $ 319 billion for the state non-financial public sector. In most states, general government net financial liabilities in 2013 exceeded 100 % of revenue, having increased steeply since 2007. The states’ financial position has deteriorated because their <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surpluses</b> have shrunk while capital (‘infrastructure’) spending soared, resulting in large cash deficits. All states have experienced this deterioration: Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania have lost the coveted triple-A credit rating, and NSW and Victoria are at risk of being downgraded should current trends continue. All states have curbed the growth of operating expenditure, but they will need to persevere in the face of sluggish revenue if they are to rebuild <b>operating</b> <b>surpluses</b> and avoid sharp cuts in capital expenditure...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper {{is to examine the}} relationship between employment protection regulations and profits in the European economies. Using regression analysis on the panel of 18 European countries over the period 1998 - 2008, we study the effect of EPL index on <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> of mixed income (a measure of profits). Our findings confirm a statistically significant negative relation between EPL index and profits at the level of economies, implying that more rigid employment legislation, and by that higher hiring and firing costs, hinder an efficient allocation of resources, resulting in lower efficiency of companies and in decline of profits. Although the effect is small, we believe that further flexibilization of employment protection regulation presents an important determinant not only for labor market performance and productivity, but also for companiesʼ profits and therefore for the competitiveness of the European countries...|$|E
40|$|Information {{technology}} has already transformed {{some areas of}} our lives, and has the prospect for transforming other sectors. This paper is about economic behaviors that anticipate technical progress, and how they may describe the housing price and construction boom of 2000 - 2006 and the bust thereafter. Specifically, I note that {{only a minority of}} housing output remains as an operating surplus for the structures’ owners. It follows the prospect of productivity shocks to the mortgage and real estate industries have the potential to both move housing prices and non-residential consumption in the same direction, and that demand impulses are magnified in their effects on housing prices. A bust occurs when those impulses are realized later, or in a lesser magnitude, than originally anticipated.

40|$|I {{investigate}} consumption smoothing (sensitivity) under {{a balanced}} budget rule in Swedish municipalities. In general, I find Swedish municipalities to be highly consumption sensitive during the time period 2001 - 2011 when the BBR was in place. A one percentage increase in predicted current revenues leads to a 0. 74 - 0. 76 percentage increase in current consumption. I use fiscal indicators - the level of own funds and <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> - as proxies for budget balance boundness. Municipalities that perform well in both these fiscal areas are more smoothing than municipalities that do not perform well in either, implying that budget balance plays a role for consumption smoothing behavior. However, consumption sensitivity has decreased in the aggregate since {{the implementation of the}} BBR. A possible story is that municipalities were primarily upward sensitive before the BBR, and primarily downward sensitive after the BBR. This explanation also fits the descriptive picture that the aggregate surplus in the sector has turned to positive from negative since the BBR implementation...|$|E

40|$|An {{overview}} {{is provided}} of the history, logic, merits {{and limitations of}} the national accounts. Past In {{the second half of}} the seventeenth century the first estimates of national income were made. These estimates served clear purposes, like demonstrating that a revision of the English tax system could raise sufficient resources for waging a war with Holland or France. The number of estimates and their frequency gradually increased, in particular since the First World War. Major innovations, like the development of the sector accounts, input-output tables and the arrival of the first guidelines took place in the thirties and forties. These innovations were stimulated by the Keynesian revolution and the development of macro-econometric model building. Since the Second World War national accounts statistics have become institutionalised and standardised, i. e. they are regularly compiled by national statistical institutes, Central Banks or Ministries and are based on one universal set of multi-purpose concepts and classifications. About a decade ago, the third generation of international guidelines on national accounting was introduced. In comparison to the first guidelines, the scope was drastically extended, e. g. by the inclusion of prices and volumes, balance sheets and input-output tables. However, the basic concepts, like the production boundary have hardly been changed in fifty years. Since the collapse of communism, no separate guidelines and concepts exist for the (formerly) communist countries. The European Unification has stimulated a revolution in national accounting, in particular with respect to the development of jurisprudence and the improvement and harmonization of the estimates. The European Union was not only aware of the possibilities of the national accounts as a tool for European policy, but acted also as a critical consumer. The latter was vital for generating this revolution in European national accounts practice. Present National accounts statistics are a miracle come true: all over the world, very incomplete, imperfect, heterogeneous and partly outdated data are transformed into a complete, consistent, internationally standardised and up-to-date overview of the national economy and its major components. What is the magic behind this miracle? The universal model National accounts statistics are estimates of a universal accounting model for describing, analysing and managing national economies. This universal model is not a neutral description of economic reality: it is focused on what can be readily observed in monetary terms, it contains substantial transformations of what can be observed and is based on a specific way of labelling economic reality. Different choices would have resulted in a different picture of economic reality. The major biases of the universal model merely reflect the natural focus of a regular economic statistic, i. e. a focus on what can be readily observed in monetary terms. This explains why the economic importance of unpaid household services, leisure time, pollution and tax expenditures is ignored. Including such major analytic elements in the basic concepts would seriously endanger the statistical purpose of the universal model. Furthermore, it would also drastically decrease the relevance of the universal model and its major aggregates for important other data needs, e. g. those of budgetary and monetary policy. The substantial transformations of what can be readily observed are required in order to look –on behalf of analysis and policy- through the complex, chaotic and many different economic and institutional realities. The specific concepts used are the result of many implicit and explicit considerations with respect to relevance, reliability and comparability. They are also influenced by the need to agree on one set of concepts, even if arguments are not sufficient to settle the score. The universal model incorporates two types of perspectives on the national economy. Firstly, it describes the national economy in terms of its major components (sectors/industries, various types of flows and stocks and several economic processes). This is the general perspective of the universal model. However, the universal model describes also each major component in a macro-economic context and in relation to the other major components. These are the specific perspectives incorporated in the universal model. Seven major specific perspectives can be distinguished: 1. 	Non-financial corporations (business accounts); 2. 	Financial corporations (monetary policy, financial markets); 3. 	Government (budgetary policy, government finance); 4. 	Households (personal income, wealth and consumption); 5. 	Rest of the world (balance of payments); 6. 	Industries (production, employment and input-output analysis); 7. 	Other (e. g. the environment, human capital and the welfare state). The old and most recent history of the national accounts demonstrates that these specific perspectives, and in particular that of the government and its relations to the national economy, are a major motivation for compiling national accounts statistics. The universal model is an ingenious and very practical product. The various perspectives demonstrate that it is a synthesis of various types of applied economic analysis, e. g. business accounts, Keynesian type of analysis, input-output analysis and index number theory. The universal model also reflects three hundred years of experience in compiling national accounts statistics. Nevertheless, the universal model can still be improved in various ways. The universal model stresses the importance of flexibility, but does not make an explicit link to the seven perspectives. For each of these perspectives, standard supplementary concepts, like government expenditure and revenue, entrepreneurial income after tax and net worth to the owner, are very relevant and can be easily derived from the basic concepts of the universal model. For each of these perspectives also the importance of prices, volumes, real values and key-ratios should be stressed. Also some changes in the basic concepts are proposed e. g. : -	Other non-market output, e. g. of the government, should be valued including a <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> by amount of an opportunity interest on the capital invested. -	The purchase of consumer durables by households should be recorded as capital formation instead of as final consumption expenditure. Imputed services of owner-used consumer durables should be recorded by amount of its consumption of fixed capital plus an opportunity interest on the capital invested. These imputed services are consumed as part of the final consumption expenditure of households. These changes increase the relevance of the national accounts from an economic theoretic point of view. Furthermore, also various changes in the presentation of national accounts statistics are proposed, e. g. a more systematic distinction between actual and imputed flows and the limitation of the number of accounts. The national measurement process The universal model can not be estimated directly. It should first be translated into an operational model for a specific country during a specific period of time. This involves interpretation of the universal model in view of the national economy and further specification of the concepts, detail and scope. For example, which units belong to the sector government en to what extent can price- and volume measures take account of changes in quality? The operational model decides to a substantial extent what is actually measured. Differences in national operational models are therefore a serious threat to international comparability. The operational model is estimated by combining very heterogeneous and incomplete sets of data; the latter include national accounts estimates for previous periods and frames of reference for grossing up and combining data, e. g. a business register or a population census. The major estimation tools are accounting identities, plausibility checks and assumptions. The estimation process is influenced by environmental factors like skills (e. g. skills in combining data and making plausible assumptions), resources (e. g. resources for compiling good price-statistics, for maintaining a reliable business register or for compiling national accounts statistics) and policy (e. g. a mixed strategy of continuity or a preference for prudence and stability). Uses of the national accounts National accounts statistics are important for economic policy and analysis. Four different roles are played by national accounts statistics: 1. 	description and object of analysis; 2. 	tool for analysis and forecasting; 3. 	tool for communication and decision-making; 4. 	input for alternative accounts, budgetary rules and estimates. As a description and object of analysis, national accounts statistics are unique. They define and measure the national economy and its major components. They make the sizes and developments in national economies all over the world visible and put them into quantitative terms. As a consequence, the world economy, the national economies and their major components can be monitored and analysed. Not all descriptions are suited as an object of analysis. National accounts statistics are partly built on assumptions. Assumptions are essential in combining and completing the basic set of data. Plausible assumptions are even to be preferred above unreliable data. The more encompassing, up-to-date, detailed and reliable the basic data set, the smaller the role played by assumptions can be. By changing the definitions of the universal model, the role of assumptions can be increased or decreased. This also changes the usefulness of national accounts statistics as an object of analysis. For a proper analysis of national accounts statistics, sufficient information should be available about the operational concepts underlying the national accounts statistics, their reliability and the role of major specific events and institutional circumstances. Furthermore, users should have sufficient knowledge of the logic, merits and limitations of national accounts statistics in general. As a tool for analysis and forecasting, national accounts statistics are built on three very useful stocks of knowledge: the universal model, the operational model and the national compilation skills. Ignoring the national accounts as tool for analysis and forecasting can result in serious conceptual and statistical pitfalls. However, as a tool for analysis and forecasting, the national accounts have also clear limitations. For a proper use, national accounts statistics should often be rearranged or be supplemented with alternative concepts, alternative data and equations describing economic behaviour. As a tool for communication and decision-making, national accounts statistics are unique. They serve as the universal facts and language for thinking and communicating about national economies and their major components. They provide new opportunities for decision-making by providing information about major macro-economic developments, by providing explicit targets for many types of policy and by providing price-indexes for inflating contracts and agreements in real terms. However, for a proper and optimal use, knowledge of the merits and limitations of national accounts statistics is essential. National accounts statistics serve also as an input for alternative estimates, accounts for non-national accounting purposes and policy targets. As an input for alternative estimates, official national accounts statistics serve as a very cheap, well-designed, universal semi-manufactured product. These alternative estimates may reflect fundamentally different perspectives on the national economy, e. g. welfare-measures. However, some of the major alternative estimates are best labelled as non-official national accounts statistics, e. g. by providing much longer time series. National accounts can also serve as a benchmark or source of inspiration for accounts for non-national accounting purposes (e. g. for the bookkeeping systems of municipalities) and policy targets (e. g. in defining the budgetary ceilings for state expenditure in the Netherlands). In this way, the national accounts actually extends its scope as a tool for communication and decision-making. The future On the brink of the twenty-first century the world is undergoing dramatic changes. Four trends (globalisation, regionalisation, automation and more-market oriented government) are changing the data needs and possibilities of the national accounts. Globalisation and regionalisation will increase the political use of national accounts figures. This reinforces requirements on international comparability and standardisation as evidenced by the European experience. Globalisation and more-market oriented government will pose serious difficulties for the quality and completeness of the statistics and administrative data sources used for compiling national accounts figures. A pro-active response is essential for statisticians. The possibilities for national accountants may be increased due to automation, putting minimum standards on the inputs for the national accounts statistics to increase their international comparability and advances in national accounts compilation techniques. More-market oriented government can stimulate the development of more efficient, effective and attractive national accounts statistics that appeal to a wide range of data users. However, it can also result in cutting down the resources for national accounts statistics and its major inputs below a minimum-level. National accounts statistics will then be trapped: resources are not enough to meet a minimum standard of reliability, to make national accounts statistics more attractive and to find new users; the potentials of the national accounts statistics are then trapped. In order to meet these challenges and dangers of the future, the efficiency and the national accounts as a product should be improved. This can be done in various ways, e. g. by: -	Developing an international long term strategy for improving national accounts compilation techniques; -	A better balance between the compilation process and the outputs; -	More modules for specific purposes. Some of these could contain internationally standardized supplementary concepts, like entrepreneurial income after tax, government expenditure and revenue or household income in cash. They may also contain modelling results, as modelling is often essential for a balanced view on the national economy. -	An international, EU-like, program for increasing the reliability and comparability of major national accounts variables, e. g. Domestic Product and the volume growth of Domestic Product. -	Investigation of user practice and the lessons that can be learned from that. -	Supplementing national accounts statistics with information about their meaning and reliability, e. g. about the operational concepts, the data sources, compilation methods, the size of the differences between successive estimates and the results of various types of sensitivity analyses. In order to clarify the value-added of national accounting and to fight wide-spread illiteracy in national accounting, marketing and education should be taken up seriously, preferably by an international long term strategy and by making use of all the possibilities of internet. ...|$|E
