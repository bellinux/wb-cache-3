40|$|Purpose of the Work This 12 -month {{prospective}} study describes {{the characteristics of}} a group of elite cross-country skiers using subject demographics; intake physical measurements (Movement Competency Screen—MCS, hamstring length, and trunk muscle endurance); and monthly injury, training, and racing reports. The primary hypothesis is that <b>new</b> <b>injury</b> is associated with poor movement competency. Secondary hypotheses are that <b>new</b> <b>injury</b> is associated with (a) a history of injury, (b) a long career in cross-country skiing, (c) high training hours, (d) high running training hours, (e) high roller ski training hours, (f) poor trunk muscle endurance, and (g) reduced active straight leg raise (ASLR). Mean injury incidence will be used to examine differences between the injury incidence rates of (a) the ski season and off-season, (b) traumatic and nontraumatic injuries, and (c) injuries by anatomic location. Introduction Cross-country ski injury incidence studies have employed variable methodologies, using retrospective injury and training surveillance. Standardised injury incidence measures will improve the understanding of cross-country ski injury incidence. Studying the relationship between movement patterns and <b>new</b> <b>injury</b> may identify risk factors for future injury, and eventually reduce injury rates with appropriate intervention strategies. Methods At enrolment, 71 professional or collegiate cross-country skiers (35 men, 36 women) provided demographics and injury history, then performed the Movement Competency Screen (MCS), hamstring length, and trunk muscle endurance tests. Self-report electronic injury and training surveillance occurred monthly for 12 months. Spearman’s correlation determined the relationship between <b>new</b> <b>injury</b> and MCS score, past injury, total training time, and run training time. A t-test compared injury incidence (the mean number of injuries per subject per 1, 000 training/exposure hours) between anatomic regions, type of injuries, and seasons. Results/Main Points The study was completed by 58 % of subjects (18 men, 23 women). There were 3. 18 injuries per subject per 1, 000 training/exposure hours. <b>New</b> <b>injury</b> was not correlated with MCS score, but was correlated with previous injury (p <. 05). <b>New</b> <b>injury</b> did increase as the time spent running increased, although not significantly (p =. 08). <b>New</b> <b>injury</b> was not correlated with any other variable. Risk factor analysis found previous injury {{was a significant predictor of}} <b>new</b> <b>injury</b> when accounting for overall training time, run time, and MCS score. Lower-extremity injury incidence (2. 13) was significantly higher than upper extremity (0. 46) or trunk injury incidence (0. 22). Nontraumatic/overuse injury incidence (2. 76) was significantly higher than acute injury incidence (1. 05) (p <. 05). Off-season injury incidence (5. 25) was higher than ski season (2. 27), although not significantly (p =. 07). Conclusion This is the first examination of the relationship between MCS score and <b>new</b> <b>injury</b> in cross-country skiers. <b>New</b> <b>injury</b> positively correlated with previous injury, but not with MCS score, hamstring length, trunk endurance ratio, or training/exposure hours. Lower-extremity and nontraumatic/overuse injuries had the highest incidence rates. Previously injured skiers are at greater risk for further injury. The results lay the foundation for further movement and injury studies and future injury prevention strategies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Description of the {{anatomical}} severity of injuries in trauma patients is important. While the Injury Severity Score has {{been regarded as}} the “gold standard” since its creation, several {{studies have indicated that}} the <b>New</b> <b>Injury</b> Severity Score is better. Therefore, we aimed to systematically evaluate and compare the accuracy of the Injury Severity Score and the <b>New</b> <b>Injury</b> Severity Score in predicting mortality. Methods: Two researchers independently searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases and included studies from which the exact number of true-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative results could be extracted. Quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist criteria. The meta-analysis was performed using Meta-DiSc. Meta-regression, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the source(s) of heterogeneity and factor(s) affecting the accuracy of the <b>New</b> <b>Injury</b> Severity Score and the Injury Severity Score in predicting mortality. Results: The heterogeneity of the 11 relevant studies (total n = 11, 866) was high (I 2 > 80 %). The meta-analysis using a random-effects model resulted in sensitivity of 0. 64, specificity of 0. 93, positive likelihood ratio of 5. 11, negative likelihood ratio of 0. 27, diagnostic odds ratio of 27. 75, and area under the summary receiver operator characteristic curve of 0. 9009 for the Injury Severity Score; and sensitivity of 0. 71, specificity of 0. 87, positive likelihood ratio of 5. 22, negative likelihood ratio of 0. 20, diagnostic odds ratio of 24. 74, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 9095 for the <b>New</b> <b>Injury</b> Severity Score. Conclusion: The <b>New</b> <b>Injury</b> Severity Score and the Injury Severity Score have similar abilities in predicting mortality. Further research is required to determine the appropriate use of the Injury Severity Score or the <b>New</b> <b>Injury</b> Severity Score based on specific patient condition and trauma type...|$|R

40|$|Background Prospective, {{cross-country}} ski injury incidence data is scarce. Objective To describe injury {{type and}} incidence sustained by elite cross-country skiers in north-eastern America. We hypothesized that lower extremity injury incidence would {{be higher than}} other body regions. A secondary aim was to determine any factors that correlate with <b>new</b> <b>injury.</b> Design A prospective, longitudinal study that included: demographics (ski and injury history); Movement Competency Screening (MCS); hamstring length measurement; core muscle endurance testing (trunk flexor to extensor ratio). Athletes then completed 12 consecutive, monthly electronic surveys about training, racing, and injury status. Setting Collegiate and professional ski team practices. Patients (or Participants) A convenience sample of 71 cross-country skiers (age 18 – 27 years, 35 men); 41 participants (18 men) completed the study. Independent variables MCS score; hamstring length; ratio of trunk flexor to extensor endurance; injury history; training activities and hours; training lost to injury. Main Outcome Measurements <b>New</b> <b>injury</b> reports. Results Mean injury incidence was 3. 81 <b>new</b> <b>injuries</b> per participant, per 1, 000 hours of training. Injury incidences for lower extremity (2. 13), and overuse/non-traumatic (2. 76) injuries were significantly greater than trunk (0. 22), upper extremity (0. 46), or acute/traumatic (1. 05) injuries (p 0. 05). Past injuries were {{a significant predictor of}} <b>new</b> <b>injuries,</b> when accounting for training time, running time and MCS score (p< 0. 05).

30|$|This history {{suggested}} a hypothesis. The year 2005 {{might not be}} the only year in which one could say that a new consciousness of the long-term consequences of injuries in football “began,” but it was close. Further, Binney (2015) had just published figures showing how <b>new</b> <b>injuries</b> and injury prevalence vary from 1  week to the next in the regular season. The incidence of <b>new</b> <b>injuries</b> remains flat from Week 2 to 17; but injury prevalence increases in a roughly linear way as the season wears on. The suggested hypothesis was that the original observation was somehow due to the general recognition that injuries in the NFL were serious and long-lasting. In addition, if injuries somehow brought about the drop in home advantage, then the increasing course of injury prevalence from week to week in the regular season should be accompanied by decreasing home advantage. The present paper is an exploration of this hypothesis.|$|R
