5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is <b>now</b> <b>her</b> uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This {{passivity}} is given comic treatment when Troilus passes out in Criseyde's bedroom and is lifted into her bed by Pandarus. Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis is {{comparable to that of}} Hamlet who may have been based on him. It can be seen as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less kindly.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 Harris's {{short stories}} were {{collected}} {{under the title}} Away from the Here and <b>Now.</b> <b>Her</b> stories have also been reprinted in anthologies such as Daughters of Earth: Feminist Science Fiction in the 20th Century (with a critical essay), Sci-Fi Womanthology, Amazing Science Fiction Anthology: The Wonder Years 1926-1935, and Gosh Wow! Sense of Wonder Science Fiction. She wrote one novel, Persephone of Eleusis: A Romance of Ancient Greece (1923).|$|E
5|$|Scott {{returned}} to Hollywood and Graham; Zelda {{returned to}} the hospital. She nonetheless made progress in Asheville, and in March 1940, four years after admittance, she was released. She was nearing forty <b>now,</b> <b>her</b> friends were long gone, and the Fitzgeralds no longer had much money. Scott was increasingly embittered by his own failures and his old friend Hemingway's continued success. They wrote each other frequently until Scott's death in December 1940. Zelda was unable to attend his funeral in Rockville, Maryland.|$|E

5|$|She reports {{her brother}} Jake after she {{witnessed}} {{him trying to}} rape Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox). Steph told Max that he and Tom were <b>now</b> <b>her</b> family, a family further bonded when he proposed marriage. Steph becomes friends with Niall, who fell for her, although she saw him more as someone to confide her problems in. Max began to see Steph as selfish and only interested in her career and money, which led to several arguments between the pair. One day, he caught her alone with Niall, wearing only a shirt. She'd spilled something on her dress, but he assumed the worst and they broke up. A few days later {{she went back to}} Niall's place and they kissed, but were interrupted by his room-mate.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a closeup shot of Katy's face, {{surrounded}} by alternating red and blue lights, as she mouths the song's lyrics. It then changes to a mechanics' shop, where two young men are seen sitting, looking to the ground. Shots of sparks then appear in the screen, which emerge from a car. Katy {{is sitting on the}} automobile's passenger seat, while looking to her love interest, who is repairing the car, seemingly worried. She is later seen being driven by her boyfriend's group in that car. Her boyfriend is seen lying on a bed, and looking at the mirror, looking distantly. The car seen before finally arrives in a car parking lot where other cars are driving in circles. They exit their cars while others start driving again. The video's final scenes take place at the car parking lot, while the cars keep driving, with shots of women and other men sitting on the cars. The visual finally closes with a similar shot to that seen in the beginning, of Katy's face surrounded by lights, though <b>now,</b> <b>her</b> face is mixed with her love interest's.|$|E
5|$|These films {{took many}} liberties {{from the book}} series casting-wise. Red-haired Granville's {{portrayal}} of the then-blonde Nancy was portrayed to be ditzy, absent-minded, and more meddling that that of the ongoing book series. While the Carson Drew of the books was portrayed as older, feeble, {{and more of a}} hands-off parent, John Litel's Carson was young and handsome, much more athletically fit, and tried his best to restrain Nancy from getting into danger. Ned/Ted was even more drastically altered: instead of being Nancy's boyfriend in college who lives in a different town, he was <b>now</b> <b>her</b> next-door neighbor, who was a year older than her and their romance was very ambiguous and tumultuous. The recurring character of the older Hannah Gruen was replaced with Effie Schneider, a minor character in the books who was Hannah's teenage niece. Effie and Hannah's characteristics were merged, although Effie's fidgety, frightful nature retained prominence for comedic effect. In addition to these four, a new character Captain Tweedy was added, to portray the stereotypical bumbling, clueless cop that mirrored Steve McBride in the Torchy Blane series. Nancy's friends Bess and George did not appear in the film series, and never mentioned or referred to.|$|E

25|$|The Queen's Theatre at the Haymarket (<b>now</b> <b>Her</b> Majesty's Theatre), {{established}} in 1705 by architect and playwright John Vanbrugh, quickly became an opera house.

25|$|Frequently {{the stories}} test {{the limits of}} taboo. In one case, the wife {{introduces}} her lover as a cousin to enable his entry into the house.

In another story, the wife has both father and son as lovers, and she has {{to deal with the problem}} of what to do when her husband stumbles upon the scene.|$|E

25|$|Nuer girls usually marry at 17 or 18. If a {{young girl}} gets engaged at an early age, the wedding and consummation ceremonies are {{essentially}} delayed. Women generally give birth to their first children when they are mature enough to bear them. As long as a girl marries a man with cattle, she pretty much has the free will to choose her mate. <b>Now,</b> <b>her</b> parents can choose a mate for her, but they ask for her consent. It is quite tough for parents to force their daughter to marry a man she isn't attracted to or simply dislikes. Nuer girls do stand up against being pressured by family {{when it comes to}} marriage issues.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} sound in films had created new {{opportunities}} for musicians, and Montaner launched on a new career as a film performer. After a musical number in a 1934 film, she made two films in 1938. Radio, too, was developing as a mass medium which was wide open to musical talent. La Montaner was to {{make good use of}} both these opportunities. But by <b>now</b> <b>her</b> temperament was getting out of control. Gonzalo Roig detailed the story of her sacking from the Lecuona show, María la O, at the Teatro Martí. During a duet with the tenor about the rekindling of betrayed love, she began to tear his clothes off on stage! That was a step too far for the management.|$|E
25|$|Business {{rates are}} the latest {{incarnation}} {{of a series of}} taxes for funding local services known as rates, based on property values. The first rate was part of the Elizabethan Poor Law Act 1572, which established relief for the poor at the local parish level, paid for by inhabitants of the parish. A system of rates to fund local government and services evolved over the next three centuries, including a separate system for London from 1869 to 1963. Changes included a stricter definition of how to value for a rate; the introduction of a valuation list containing the assessed values; the ability to object to the assessed value; and the introduction of the valuation officer, appointed by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue (<b>now</b> <b>Her</b> Majesty's Revenue and Customs), as the assessor.|$|E

25|$|LaBelle later {{accounted}} in her memoirs {{that she}} was sexually assaulted by Jackie Wilson while at the Brooklyn Fox Theatre in the 1960s. Around 1964, LaBelle was engaged to Otis Williams, founding member of The Temptations, but broke it off due to scheduling conflicts. In 1969, LaBelle married a longtime friend, Armstead Edwards. After LaBelle started a solo career, Edwards became her manager until the couple separated in the late 1990s. In 2000, the couple announced they had legally separated. Three years later, their divorce was finalized. They have a son, Zuri Kye Edwards (born 1973), who is <b>now</b> <b>her</b> current manager. In addition to Zuri, LaBelle has two people in her life who are like sons to her, Dodd and Stanley. LaBelle came to know them {{after the death of}} their mother, Veaunita, a neighborhood acquaintance.|$|E
25|$|In 1243 Brno {{was granted}} {{the large and}} small city {{privileges}} by the King, and thus it was recognized as a royal city. In 1324 Queen Elisabeth Richeza of Poland founded the current Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady which is <b>now</b> <b>her</b> final resting place. In the 14th century, Brno {{became one of the}} centres for the Moravian regional assemblies, whose meetings alternated between Brno and Olomouc. These assemblies made political, legal, and financial decisions. Brno and Olomouc were also the seats of the Land Court and the Land Tables, thus they were the two most important cities in Moravia. From the mid 14th century to the early 15th century the Špilberk Castle had served as the permanent seat of the Margraves of Moravia (Moravian rulers); one of them was elected the King of the Romans. In the 15th century Brno was besieged in 1428 and again in 1430 by the Hussites during the Hussite Wars. Both attempts to conquer the city failed.|$|E
