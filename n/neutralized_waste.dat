To neutralize the waste, there were two tests. In the test I have been evaluated concentrations of 0. 0, 0. 7, 1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0 and 8. 0 % of virgin lime residue by delinting period of 18 hours. From these results the test took place II, which consisted of adopting intermediate concentrations between the two predetermined in the test I, in two days of exposure (18 and 48 hours) for more precise definition of dose and time of the neutralization be used. The results indicated that the use of virgin lime in doses of 2. 5 %, for 48 hours, was effective for the neutralization of chemical delinting residue of cotton seed raising its pH to the range considered acceptable for the launch of effluents by CONAMA Resolution 357 / 2005.

40|$|Methods {{are being}} {{developed}} for the selective removal of the two principal radioactive contaminants, {sup 90 }Sr and {sup 137 }Cs, from liquid low-level waste generated and/or stored at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. These methods are {{to be used in}} a future centralized treatment facility at ORNL. Removal of {sup 90 }Sr in the proposed treatment flashed is based on coprecipitation from strongly alkaline waste by adding stable strontium to the waste solution. Ferric sulfate, added with the stable strontium, improves the {sup 90 }Sr removal and aids in the flocculation of the strontium carbonate (SrCO{sub 3 }) precipitate. After separation of the solids, the resultant supernate is adjusted to pH 8 for the cesium removal treatment. Upon pH adjustment, aluminum originally present in the untreated alkaline waste precipitates and sorbs an additional amount of {sup 90 }Sr. Cesium is removed from the <b>neutralized</b> <b>waste</b> by two sequential treatments with potassium cobalt hexacyanoferrate (KCCF) slurry formed by the addition of potassium ferrocyanide (K{sub 4 }Fe(CN) {sub 6 }) and cobalt nitrate (Co(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 }) solutions.

To confirm that the solution generated during the current HB-Line dissolving campaign can be poisoned with Gd, neutralized and discarded to the Savannah River Site (SRS) high level waste (HLW) system without undue nuclear safety concerns the caustic precipitation of surrogate solutions was examined. Experiments were performed with a U/Pu/Gd solution representative of the HB-Line estimated concentration ratio and also a U/Gd solution. Depleted U {{was used in the}} experiments as the enrichment of the U will not affect the chemical behavior during neutralization, but will affect the amount of Gd added to the solution. Settling behavior of the neutralized solutions was found to be comparable to previous studies. The neutralized solutions mixed easily and had expected densities of typical <b>neutralized</b> <b>waste.</b> The neutralized solids were found to be homogeneous and less than 20 microns in size. Partially neutralized solids were more amorphous than the fully neutralized solids. Based on the results of these experiments, Gd was found to be a viable poison for neutralizing a U/Pu/Gd solution with a U:Pu mass ratio of 4. 3 : 1 thus extending the U:Pu mass ratio from the previously investigated 0 - 3 : 1 to 4. 3 : 1.

40|$|Depleted uranium (DU) {{chips and}} {{turnings}} are generated during machining of uranium metal. Because high surface area uranium is pyrophoric, the turnings {{are subject to}} spontaneous ignition in air. The oxidation of uranium to U 0 {sub 2 } and U{sub 3 } 0 {sub 8 } is highly exothermic and therefore the reaction may be self-sustaining. A uranium fire or even rapid oxidation and thermal convection currents will cause emission of radioactive uranium oxides. In the presence of water as liquid or vapor, uranium may also oxidize into U 0 {sub 2 } and U{sub 3 } 0 {sub 8 }-with generation of hydrogen, a flammable and explosive gas. The heat generated the water reaction may ignite the uranium or hydrogen producing a fire, explosion, or convection current resulting in some uranium oxide becoming airborne. Because the high surface area uranium has the hazardous characteristic of reactivity, it is stored immersed in diesel oil preventing contact with water or air. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has developed and constructed a process to remove the reactivity characteristic by oxidizing uranium metal to an inert product. This inert form can then be landfilled as a low-level waste. The treatment process consists of draining the packing oils, treating with sodium hypochlorite to wet-oxidize the DU to uranyl hydroxide (UO{sub 2 }(OH) {sub 2 }), using sodium thiosulfate to reduce the (UO{sub 2 }(OH) 2) to U 0 {sub 2 }, neutralizing with sodium hydroxide, and stabilizing the settled slurry in a cement matrix.

40|$|The Zirflex Process {{employs a}} boiling aqueous {{solution}} of ammonium fluoride and ammonium nitrate to dissolve zirconium or Zircaloy. Average unoxidized Zircaloy dissolution rates are from 10 to 15 mils/hr for the optimum charge solution of 5. 5 M NH/sub 4 /F- 0. 5 M NH/sub 4 /NO/sub 3 / at a F/Zr mole ratio of 7. Zircaloy, which is oxidized {{by exposure to}} high-temperature air or water, dissolves at rates of threeto five-fold less. Cores of uranium, uranium- aluminum, and uranium dioxide are not severely attacked by the Zirflex decladding solutions. Only the soluble uranium enters the waste, with losses varying from 0. 3 to 3. 0 g/l. The Zirflex waste solution is neutralized to a pH of 10 before storage. This requires approximately 0. 07 gallon of 50 % caustic per gallon of decladding solution. The <b>neutralized</b> <b>waste</b> consists of nearly 20 vol. % of rapidly settling solids, which are easily slurried under turbulent flow conditions. These solids tend to settle out in streamline flow and therefore agitation is required during temporary storage. Conventional nitric acid core dissolution is generally applicable to Zircaloy-clad uranium and UO/sub 2 / elements since the core material is essentially free from zirconium. The addition of aluminum nitrate to the nitric acid dissolvent at an aluminum/ residual F/sup -/ mole ratio of approximately three is necessary, however, to ixhibit the corrosive action of residual fluoride.

This can be achieved either by improving water quality parameters, providing oxygen and removing or <b>neutralizing</b> <b>wastes,</b> or by slowing down the fish metabolism, thereby reducing stress and reducing oxygen intake rate, wastes excretion and water acidification. Some possible methods to improve water quality parameters of the transport tank include the addition of ammonia quenchers, coupled with buffering agents to keep a stable pH and thus maintain low ammonia build-up (Correia et al. 2011). Others have suggested the use of immersion anaesthetics sedatives or cooling of the tank water by 5 – 10  °C as measures to slow down metabolic rates of the transported fish (Berka 1986; Rimmer and Franklin 1997; Harmon 2009). These practices however, are more applicable to closed and semi-enclosed transport tanks, which recirculates and reuse the treated water.

40|$|H-Canyon {{will begin}} {{dissolving}} High Aluminum - Low Uranium (High Al/Low U) Used Nuclear Fuel (UNF) following approval by DOE which is anticipated in CY 2011. High Al/Low U is an aluminum/enriched uranium UNF with small quantities of uranium relative to aluminum. The maximum enrichment level expected is 93 % {sup 235 }U. The High Al/Low U UNF will be dissolved in H-Canyon in a nitric acid/mercury/gadolinium solution. The resulting solution will be neutralized {{and transferred to}} Tank 39 H in the Tank Farm. To confirm that the solution generated could be poisoned with Gd, neutralized, and discarded to the Savannah River Site (SRS) high level waste (HLW) system without undue nuclear safety concerns the caustic precipitation of simulant solutions was examined. Experiments were performed with three simulant solutions representative of the H-Canyon estimated concentrations in the final solutions after dissolution. The maximum U, Gd, and Al concentration were selected for testing from the range of solution compositions provided. Simulants were prepared in three different nitric acid concentrations, ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 M. The simulant solutions were neutralized to four different endpoints: (1) just before a solid phase was formed (pH 3. 5 - 4), (2) the point where a solid phase was obtained, (3) 0. 8 M free hydroxide, and (4) 1. 2 M free hydroxide, using 50 wt % sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The settling behavior of the neutralized solutions {{was found to be}} slower compared to previous studies, with settling continuing over a one week period. Due to the high concentration of Al in these solutions, precipitation of solids was observed immediately upon addition of NaOH. Precipitation continued as additional NaOH was added, reaching a point where the mixture becomes almost completely solid due to the large amount of precipitate. As additional NaOH was added, some of the precipitate began to redissolve, and the solutions neutralized to the final two endpoints mixed easily and had expected densities of typical <b>neutralized</b> <b>waste.</b> Based on particle size and scanning electron microscopy analyses, the neutralized solids were found to be homogeneous and less than 20 microns in size. The majority of solids were less than 4 microns in size. Compared to previous studies, a larger percentage of the Gd was found to precipitate in the partially neutralized solutions (at pH 3. 5 - 4). In addition the Gd:U mass ratio was found to be at least 1. 0 in all of the solids obtained after partial or full neutralization. The hydrogen to U (H:U) molar ratios for two accident scenarios were also determined. The first was for transient neutralization and agitator failure. Experimentally this scenario was determined by measuring the H:U ratio of the settled solids. The minimum H:U molar ratio for solids from fully neutralized solutions was 388 : 1. The second accident scenario is for the solids drying out in an unagitiated pump box. Experimentally, this scenario was determined by measuring the H:U molar ratio in centrifuged solids. The minimum H:U atom ratios for centrifuged precipitated solids was 250 : 1. It was determined previously that a 30 : 1 H:Pu atom ratio was sufficient for a 1 : 1 Gd:Pu mass ratio. Assuming a 1 : 1 equivalence with {sup 239 }Pu, the results of these experiments show Gd is a viable poison for neutralizing U/Gd solutions with the tested compositions...|$|E

The temperature rise of a DSSF grout prepared with <b>waste</b> partially <b>neutralized</b> with HCl was 28 C after 300 hr hydration. Temperature rise for a grout made with DSSF partially neutralized with H 3 PO 4 was 43 C. These values compare with a temperature rise of > 52 C for a grout made with untreated DSSF. Decreasing the mix ratio from 9 lb/gal to 7. 5 lb/gal did not significantly reduce the adiabatic temperature rise of grouts prepared with partially <b>neutralized</b> DSSF <b>waste...</b>|$|R
40|$|High-level {{radioactive}} waste stored in tanks at the U. S. Department of Energy`s (DOE`s) Hanford Site will be pretreated to concentrate radioactive constituents and fed to the vitrification plant A flowsheet for feed preparation within the vitrification plant (based on the Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant (HWVP) design) called for HCOOH addition during the feed preparation step to adjust rheology and glass redox conditions. However, {{the potential for}} generating H{sub 2 } and NH{sub 3 } during treatment of high-level waste (HLW) with HCOOH was identified at Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL). Studies at the University of Georgia, under contract with Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) and PNL, have verified the catalytic role of noble metals (Pd, Rh, Ru), present in the waste, in the generation of H{sub 2 } and NH{sub 3 }. Both laboratory-scale and pilot-scale studies at SRTC have documented the H{sub 2 } and NH{sub 3 } generation phenomenal Because H{sub 2 } and NH{sub 3 } may create hazardous conditions in the vessel vapor space and offgas system of a vitrification plant, reducing the H{sub 2 } generation rate and the NH{sub 3 } generation to the lowest possible levels consistent with desired melter feed characteristics is important. The Fiscal Year 1993 and 1994 studies were conducted with simulated (non-radioactive), pre-treated <b>neutralized</b> current acid <b>waste</b> (NCAW). <b>Neutralized</b> current acid <b>waste</b> is a high-level waste originating from the plutonium/uranium extraction (PUREX) plant that has been partially denitrated with sugar, neutralized with NaOH, and is presently stored in double-shell tanks. The non-radioactive simulant used {{for the present study}} includes all of the trace components found in the waste, or substitutes a chemically similar element for radioactive or very toxic species. The composition and simulant preparation steps were chosen to best simulate the chemical processing characteristics of the actual waste...|$|R
