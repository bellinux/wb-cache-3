However, {{almost all of the}} civic groups along the Jamaica branch's route opposed that branch due to concerns about <b>nuisance,</b> <b>noise,</b> and traffic. There were multiple protests against the AirTrain project; during one such protest in 2000, a crane caught fire in a suspected arson. Homeowners in the vicinity believed that the concrete supports would lower the prices of their houses. Residents were also concerned about the noise that an elevated structure would create, which was a main factor in the cancellation of the LaGuardia Airport connection. According to a 2012 study, the vast majority of residents' complaints were due to [...] "nuisance violations." [...] The Port Authority responded to residents' concerns by imposing strict rules regarding disruptive or loud construction activity and implementing a streamlined damage claim process which quickly compensated homeowners who suffered damage to their homes {{as a result of the}} construction. Through 2002, there were 550 nuisance complaints about the AirTrain's construction, of which 98% had been resolved by April of that year. On the other hand, at least one community board—Queens Community Board 12, which includes South Jamaica along the AirTrain's route—recorded few complaints regarding AirTrain construction.|$|E

40|$|The {{domestication}} of {{the urban}} territory and the regulation of the public space have long been processes of architectural formation. The sensory deprivation of the spatial experience by the twentieth-century society encompassed a series of interventions {{that resulted in the}} silencing of the cityscape.

In architectural practice, in particular, sound is largely studied from a scientific point of view in acoustical considerations, aimed at the control of the dissipation of waves in interior spaces. The paper presents recent theoretical and experimental doctoral research aimed at the characterisation of sound as a building material in spatial practice revealing a correlation between active/passive listening and the creation of space.

Traditional sleeper materials are timber, steel, and concrete. Cost-efficiency, superior durability, and improved track stability are the main factors toward significant adoption of concrete materials for railway sleepers. The sleepers in a track system, as shown in Figure 1, are subjected to harsh and aggressive external forces and natural environments across a distance. Many systemic problems and technical issues associated with concrete sleepers have been tackled over decades. These include pre-mature failures of sleepers, concrete cancer or ettringite, abrasion of railseats and soffits, impact damages by rail machinery, bond-slip damage, longitudinal and lateral instability of track system, dimensional instability of sleepers, <b>nuisance</b> <b>noise</b> and vibration, and so on (Pfeil, 1997; Gustavson, 2002; Kaewunruen and Remennikov, 2008 a,b, 2013).

40|$|Functional data {{analyses}} typically proceed by smoothing, followed by functional PCA. This paradigm implicitly assumes that rough variation {{is due to}} <b>nuisance</b> <b>noise.</b> Nevertheless, relevant functional features such as time-localised or short scale fluctuations may indeed be rough relative to the global scale, but still smooth at shorter scales. These may be confounded with the global smooth components of variation by the smoothing and PCA, potentially distorting the parsimony and interpretability of the analysis. The goal {{of this paper is}} to investigate how both smooth and rough variations can be recovered on the basis of discretely observed functional data. Assuming that a functional datum arises as the sum of two uncorrelated components, one smooth and one rough, we develop identifiability conditions for the recovery of the two corresponding covariance operators. The key insight is that they should possess complementary forms of parsimony: one smooth and low rank (large scale), and the other banded and potentially high rank (small scale). Our conditions elucidate the precise interplay between rank, bandwidth, and grid resolution. Under these conditions, we show that the recovery problem is equivalent to a low rank matrix completion, and exploit this to construct estimators of the two covariances, without assuming knowledge of the true bandwidth or rank; we establish their consistency and rates of convergence, and use them to recover the smooth and rough components of each functional datum by best linear prediction. As a result, we effectively produce separate functional PCAs for smooth and rough variation. Our work bears similarities with low rank plus sparse matrix recovery, but is essentially different in that it is genuinely functional and rests on deterministic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{high-bypass}} turbofan engines produce {{high levels}} of <b>nuisance</b> <b>noise</b> that has {{a significant impact on}} the environment near airports as well as the crew and passengers inside the aircraft. Significant research is being undertaken to understand the aeroacoustic noise source mechanisms and to accurately predict engine noise levels. High-performance computers and advanced numerical techniques are now taking an active role in this research area. In this work, a numerical solver is developed to accurately and efficiently predict noise radiation from ducts. The solver is based upon a hybrid methodology whereby only the acoustic near-field is solved using the developed numerical solver, with the resultant far-field directivity determined from an integral solution of the Ffowcs Williams - Hawking equation. Particular emphasis has been placed on the radiation of duct modes from a realistic bypass engine intake geometry. The performance of the numerical schemes employed in the solver is analysed, with particular attention to the dispersion and dissipation qualities. A study into the determination of a suitable non-reflecting boundary condition for duct acoustics is also undertaken. Using a novel formulation of the linearised Euler equations, the solver is applied to noise radiation from a realistic engine intake geometry with background mean flow. The accuracy of the scheme is validated by comparison with analytic solutions for the unflanged duct case. For the unflanged duct case the effect of an acoustic liner is modelled using a time-domain impedance boundary condition. The effect of a locally supersonic inflow on radiation from the engine intake is examined. Finally, the solver is extended to determine multimode radiation from generic engine intakes, with the possibility to incorporate swirling mean flows and asymmetric duct geometries.

Where nesting could not be prevented, reproduction was stopped by collecting eggs repeatedly, or by spraying oil on eggs.

40|$|Noise {{pollution}} {{associated with}} urbanisation is an emerging environmental problem {{in many developing}} countries including Ghana. In comparison with other pollutants, the control of environmental noise has been hampered by insufficient knowledge of its effects on humans and of dose–response relationships, as well as by a lack of sufficient data. The study set to quantify noise and obtain the perceptions of residents in selected neighbourhoods in the main commercial area of Cape Coast, Ghana. The focus was on five selected areas: commercial centres, road junctions/busy roads, passengers loading stations, high-density residential areas, and low-density residential areas. The range of noise pollution levels, LNP, at high-density residential areas is 58 - 68 dB (A), while that of low-density residential areas is 53 - 72 dB (A). The range of traffic noise index TNI at high-density residential areas is 34 - 107 dB (A), and that of low density residential areas is 27 - 65 dB (A). There is a wide disparity in the noise level exposure by the residents in high-density residential areas and that of low-density residential areas. At 90 % confidence level, the Mean Square Ratio (MSR) calculated for LNP is 65. 02, while the tabulated value is 2. 36. Similarly, at the same confidence level, the MSR calculated for TNI is 6. 23 and the tabulated value remains as 2. 36. Since, in the two cases, the calculated MSR is greater than the tabulated value, there is a significant difference (p< 0. 05) in the noise pollution level and TNI in the locations surveyed based on the data analyzed at 90 % confidence level.

40|$|The {{brain is}} not silent. Even {{in the absence}} of stimuli are the neurons {{activated}} every now and then in what is called "spontaneous" or "background activity" which provides a noisy background to the operation of the brain. This work shows how this noise can be utilized in the cognitive process. That is, rather than being treated as a <b>nuisance,</b> <b>noise</b> is given a functional role in the brain´s activity. More than this, the role noise is given is a very essential one. In fact, the models presented in this work would not function without it. The utilization of spontaneous activity is demonstrated in two ways. First, it is shown how this activity can enable new knowledge to be assimilated by the system. This ability is described using a framework of generalised evolution that permits cognition to be considered as an evolutionary process occurring within the life-time of the individual. In this evolutionary view of cognition, the spontaneous activity provides the mechanism of variation. This mechanism of variation is very simple in its nature. Yet, its effects are able to follow the growth of an ever more complex cognitive apparatus as it evolves in the individual mind. The second demonstration of the utilization of noise is a novel model of how the brain is able to detect visual motion. The utilization of spontaneous activity significantly reduces the complexity of the model compared to traditional approaches. The model presented here makes the basic assumption that motion that are present in the current scene was already detected in the previous scene. That is, all that the model needs to do is to update the previous detection to fit the current scene. To account for the initial detection of a movement, spontaneous activity is utilized. Any motion in the visual scene is assimilated by the process if it harmonises with this background activity. Thus, the operation of the system is dependent on the presence of noise. Just like the case of knowledge acquisition mentioned above, noise is used to assimilate new structures into the system...|$|E

40|$|Cytochrome oxidase stainings {{revealed}} {{three types}} of stripes in macaque and human area V 2. The widths of these stripes are roughly 1 - 1. 5 mm in macaque and 2. 5 - 3. 5 mm in human. Stripes {{of the same kind}} are seperated from each other by ~ 4 mm in macaque (Roe and Ts'o 1997) and ~ 7 mm in human (Nasr et al. 2016). Different functional properties are attributed to thin and thick dark stripes, for example based on separated color, direction, and disparity-selective cells (Chen et al. 2008, Tootell et al. 2004). Nevertheless, the stripes remain difficult to segregate using conventional fMRI due to their size. Recently, an fMRI study (Nasr et al. 2016) using high field (7 T) and 1 mm isotropic voxels exquisitely revealed this stripe-like functional organization in human area V 2. Here, we visualized the stripes in awake macaques using sub-mm resolution and conventional field fMRI (3 T). We used the same isoluminant color and achromatic radial grating stimuli as in our previous double-label deoxyglucose study (Tootell et al. 2004) to detect the color-biased thin stripes. A size-matched binocular disparity defined radial sine-wave grating and its monocular counterpart was used to activate the disparity-biased stripes. Furthermore, myelination density mapping using T 1 - and T 2 -weighted MRI with 0. 4 mm isotropic voxel size was acquired in an attempt to visualize the pale stripes which are more myelinated compared to thin and thick stripes (Horton and Hocking 1997). During the functional scans, monkeys fixated {{at the center of the}} stimulus. Contrastenhanced fMRI data with 0. 6 mm isotropic voxels (EPI, TR 3 s) was acquired using implanted phased-array receive coils developed in our lab (Janssens et al. 2012). To minimize image artifacts caused by monkey motion, several image processing algorithms were implemented, including an optimized GRAPPA algorithm for image reconstruction (Hoge et al. 2009), a B-spline grid based nonlinear registration algorithm for EPI to EPI distortion correction and a fieldmap-based distortion correction algorithm for EPI to structue registration. Finally, a GLM denoising algorithm (Kay et al. 2013) was used to reduce physiological and other <b>nuisance</b> <b>noise</b> in the temporal domain. We found stripe-like color activations interdigitated with disparity activations in retinotopically-defined area V 2, which are reproducible across monkeys and across scan sessions of the same monkeys. Furthermore, we observed higher myelinated stripes largely separated from color- and disparity-selective stripes. These results show that high-resolution 3 T fMRI can be reliably used to study in-vivo submillimeter-scale functional organizations of the primate brain. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} {{focus will be}} on the Bijlmer, a post-war urban neighbourhood in the Southeastern part of Amsterdam. The demographics of the district are unique within the Netherlands. Only a quarter of its population is native Dutch. Contrary to problematic districts {{in other parts of the}} country where a lot of Morrocans and Turks live, the Bijlmer is the domain of other Africans and people from Surinam and the Antilles. The neighbourhood has undergone a big restructuring process between 1995 and 2011. The question is whether this physical change has lead to changes in the social climate. As goes from that urban restructuring and social climate will be key terms in the theoretical framework. To answer the research question, first of all the history of the neighbourhood has been reviewed. Due to various reasons the socio-economic situation of the district had become so bad, that policy makers saw massive physical changes as the only solution in 1992. Unsafety, vacancies, crime, (drugs) nuisance and illegality where the biggest problems pre-restructuring. The urban redevelopment process has been a physical metamorphosis for the area. Initially 95 % of the dwellings where part of gigantic high-rise residential units, now only 45 % of the dwellings are in those units. A lot of low-rise houses have been built, the level of facilities has been upgraded and the structure of the public space as a whole has been improved. In order to research the social changes, a mix of research methods has been used. Firstly an analysis has been made of existing quantitative data ('the Bijlmermonitor' and 'Living in Amsterdam') on the Bijlmer. Secondly residents have been interviewed on the street, to get to know how they experienced the restructuring process and whether they see certain social developments in the district. Thirdly a micro-etnography has been done to report on observations by the researcher. The social climate of the Bijlmer has undergone a moderately positive change between 1995 and 2011, due to the physical changes in the district. Inhabitants are happy with the demolishments of a lot of high-rise residential units, the renovation of still existing high-rise housing and new low-rise dwellings. The still existing high-rise units are managed better and the police is more committed. This makes drug <b>nuisance,</b> <b>noise</b> nuisance and dirty porches a lot less common problem. More low-rise has made the district more open, it allows residents to live less anonimously and interact better with their neighbours. The respondents are positive about the upscaling of the level of facilities in the area. Shopping centre 'Amsterdamse Poort' is the best example for that. The Bijlmer has become safer and overall a nicer place to live. The interviewees told that they felt very at home in the area and that it had everything they wanted. The mentality of the inhabitants is mainly that of "minding my own business" and of "looking the other way when something happens". People in this neighbourhood almost exclusively live within their own ethnic community, there's little contact between people with differing backgrounds. All in all, the Bijlmer is a special Dutch urban neighbourhood with a short but versatile history...|$|E

Specifically, we present a new approach that allows evaluating the annoyances caused by some nuisances of the building sites. This approach {{will be used in}} a decision support system to help managers of public spaces to reduce annoyances and improve the life quality of the townsmen.

40|$|In {{this study}} we use hedonic models to measure the {{influence}} of <b>noise</b> <b>nuisance</b> on rents, costs and values of investment properties in Switzerland. Countrywide data is provided by institutional real estate investors. The effects are measured for aircraft noise, road traffic noise and railroad noise. We show that negative effects appear between lower and upper tresholds which vary between different noise types and across residential and non-residential properties. Rents, costs and values are affected below the administrative tresholds given by the LSV and the negative impact ceases at an upper threshold. However high <b>noise</b> <b>nuisance</b> might influence investment decisions, i. e. offices are built instead of housing etc. These important effects are not given account in the data. In addition, directly measured reductions on market values are lower than the expected reductions based on empirical effects on rents and costs. The reasons for the different market value reductions {{may be found in}} the Swiss tenancy law. Rents for dwellings within existing rental agreements can only be adjusted in accordance with the change of the "reference interest rate" (Referenzzinssatz) and the CPI. The analysis shows that the average contract duration is dependent on the <b>noise</b> <b>nuisance,</b> which leads to a significant reduction of noise-induced losses within periods of increasing market rents...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a model to}} link national to local traffic forecasts. The model {{takes into account the}} empirical relationship between national and local transport developments, as well as mobility effects of the implementation of traffic and transport policy at the local level. Output of the model is the local intensity per road type and per vehicle type. The effects of local implementation of national traffic and transport policy on the local traffic intensities, <b>noise</b> <b>nuisance</b> and air pollution in towns are calculated in this study. The study shows that municipalities do not fully implement the national environment policy. This has led to higher local traffic intensities and slightly higher <b>noise</b> <b>nuisance</b> and air pollution levels. The model has been developed to improve the forecast of local traffic intensities in the so-called National Environmental Outlooks (NEO), which are periodically compiled by the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection (RIVM). An NEO presents the current status of environmental policy, specifically in the Netherlands. It indicates the future environmental quality that is expected to be achieved on the basis of measures announced by the government. Transport and traffic {{is one of the main}} sectors in the NEO causing local environmental problems such as <b>noise</b> <b>nuisance</b> and air pollution in towns...|$|R
