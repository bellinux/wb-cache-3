2500|$|Meloidogyne spp. {{were first}} {{reported}} in cassava by Neal in 1889. Damage on cassava is variable depending on cultivar planted, and {{can range from}} negligible to serious. Early-season infection leads to worse damage. [...] In most crops, nematode damage reduces plant health and growth; in cassava, though, nematode damage sometimes leads to increased aerial growth as the plants try to compensate. This possibly enables the plant to maintain a reasonable level of production. Therefore, aerial correlations to nematode density can be positive, negative or not at all. Vegetable crops grown in warm climates can experience severe losses from root-knot nematodes, and are often routinely treated with a chemical <b>nematicide.</b> Root-knot nematode damage results in poor growth, a decline in quality and yield of the crop and reduced resistance to other stresses (e.g. drought, other diseases). A high level of damage can lead to total crop loss. Nematode-damaged roots do not use water and fertilisers as effectively, leading to additional losses for the grower. In cassava, {{it has been suggested}} that levels of Meloidogyne spp. that are sufficient to cause injury rarely occur naturally. However, with changing farming systems, in a disease complex or weakened by other factors, nematode damage is likely to be associated with other problems.|$|E

A long life cycle and wide host range make it seem impractical to utilize fallowing or crop rotation methods. The use of nematicides such as D-D and methyl bromide at 2lb./100sq.ft. {{have been shown to be}} successful at limiting the numbers of nematodes and therefore limiting the spread of arabis mosaic virus. A lesser amount of <b>nematicide</b> was shown to be successful if it was applied in the winter months but was less successful if applied in the summer. <b>Nematicide</b> application is economically appropriate on land that will be used to generate high value crops.

An average worldwide crop loss of 12.6 % (equaled $ 215.77 billion) annually has been estimated due to these nematodes for only the top 20 life-sustaining crops. Due to the growing dissatisfaction with hazards of chemical <b>nematicides,</b> interest in microbial control of PPNs is increasing and biological <b>nematicides</b> are becoming an important component of environmentally friendly management systems. Fungal and bacterial <b>nematicides</b> rank high among other biocontrol agents. In order to maximize their benefits, such bio-nematicides can be included in integrated nematode management (INM) programs, and ways that make them complimentary or superior to chemical nematode management methods were highlighted. This is especially important where bio-nematicides can act synergistically or additively with other agricultural inputs in integrated pest management programs. Consolidated use of bio-nematicides and other pesticides should be practiced on a wider basis. This is especially important, since there are many bio-nematicides which are or are likely to become widely available soon. Identification of research priorities for harnessing fungal and bacterial <b>nematicides</b> in sustainable agriculture as well as understanding of their ecology, biology, mode of action, and interaction with other agricultural inputs is still needed. Therefore, accessible fungal and bacterial <b>nematicides</b> with their comprehensive references and relevant information, i.e., the active ingredient, product name, type of formulation, producer, targeted nematode species and crop, and country of origin, are summarized herein.|$|R
