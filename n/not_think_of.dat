5|$|In January 1941, Hichens {{was given}} a new command, Motor Gun Boat 64, {{becoming}} the first RNVR officer to command a MGB, and the only RNVR crewed boat in the 6th MGB Flotilla. It was when in command of MGB 64 that Hichens got his nickname Hitch. As each boat needed to select a radio call sign, Hichens could <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> anything suitable and Lieutenant Arty Shaw suggested Hitch, which stuck and remained {{with him for the}} rest of his time with the coastal forces.|$|E
5|$|With Goya we do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{the studio}} {{or even of}} the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{episode is}} a satire of unoriginal, poor {{television}} writing and references and parodies many television series. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots {{for the next}} season, the three series are Melrose Place, The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (spun off from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (spun off from Happy Days), Rhoda, a show that Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (spun off from The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Fish (spun off from Barney Miller), to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons (a spin-off of All in the Family) twice, because the writers could <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> any more spin-offs.|$|E

5|$|The game's sound team {{consisted}} of ten people: five handling general sound design, and five handling music composition. Hajime Wakai acted as the game's sound director and lead composer, {{with the other}} composers being Shiho Fujii, Mahito Yokota, and Takeshi Hama. Longtime series composer Koji Kondo had a supervisory role, only composing a single piece by himself: the music accompanying the prologue video describing the mythical origins of Demise and Hylia. He also helped in arranging the other composer's pieces, using an electric piano and a Mac computer. Fujii {{was responsible for the}} music focused on environments, dungeons, boss battles: among her work was the music for Skyloft. She used art and environmental assets so that her compositions would fit in with their environments. A first for the Zelda series, the music was performed using a live orchestra rather than synthesized instruments. It was the first time Nintendo EAD had used a live orchestra. Any previous orchestral elements in Twilight Princess, which amounted only to one track, were handled by their Tokyo division. Due to his experience, the department's musical lead Yokota was brought on to help orchestrate the score. Aonuma initially did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> using an orchestra, and was still sure the score would remain synthesized even after Wakai asked him about it. An orchestra was finally chosen after Miyamoto insisted upon it, a decision which surprised the entire team.|$|E

25|$|Relying on {{classical}} {{rules of}} warfare aiming at capturing the enemy's capital (even though Saint Petersburg was the political capital at that time, Moscow was the spiritual capital of Russia), Napoleon had expected Tsar Alexander I {{to offer his}} capitulation at the Poklonnaya Hill but the Russian command did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> surrendering.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{language of}} the Inuit is a system of closely interrelated dialects that are not readily comprehensible {{from one end of}} the Inuit world to the other, and some people do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as a single language but rather as a group of languages. However, there are no clear criteria for breaking the Inuit language into specific member languages since it forms a dialect continuum. Each band of Inuit understands its neighbours, and most likely its neighbours' neighbours; but at some remove, comprehensibility drops to a very low level.|$|E
25|$|In September 2010, {{the team}} {{revealed}} {{the first piece}} of concept art for the protagonists, created by artist Ryan Jones and based on actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, who allowed their likenesses to be used for the in-game characters. Season designer and writer Michael Stemmle emphasized that the game's graphics would take a less realistic and more stylized approach while trying to stay true to the feel of the trilogy. The puzzles were designed to rely on applying items in the inventory to characters and objects as the developers did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Marty as a protagonist that would build a gadget from various parts.|$|E
25|$|It {{was a real}} {{shock for}} Bohr...who, at first, could <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a solution. For the entire evening he was {{extremely}} agitated, and he continued passing from one scientist to another, seeking to persuade them {{that it could not}} be the case, {{that it would have been}} the end of physics if Einstein were right; but he couldn't come up with any way to resolve the paradox. I will never forget the image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement...The morning after saw the triumph of Bohr.|$|E

25|$|However, if no {{possible}} arrangement of ground conditions {{leads to the}} port conditions, the circuit might not behave the same way. The improvement factors (1 + βFB AOL) for determining input and output impedance might not work. This situation is awkward, because a failure to make a two-port may reflect a real problem (it just is not possible), or reflect a lack of imagination (for example, just did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> splitting the emitter node in two). As a consequence, when the port conditions are in doubt, at least two approaches are possible to establish whether improvement factors are accurate: either simulate an example using Spice and compare results with use of an improvement factor, or calculate the impedance using a test source and compare results.|$|E
25|$|When Dowler {{failed to}} return home, she was {{reported}} missing to the police at 7:00pm. A nationwide search for her followed, with 100 police officers and helicopters searching fields, streets and rivers around Hersham. Detectives who had investigated the abduction of Sarah Payne were called in to help. Police and the Dowler family made many appeals for information, including a reconstruction on Crimewatch UK. The Crimewatch UK appeal included a direct appeal to Dowler {{in the hope that}} she had run away from home of her own accord. A plea was also made by Pop Idol winner Will Young, whose concert Dowler had attended shortly before her disappearance. Dowler's mother expressed hope that her daughter had run away, but said that she could <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a reason why she would want to do so. The Independent reported in 2011 that Dowler had, some time previously, written a mock leaving-home letter and notes showing she had been unhappy.|$|E
500|$|In 1937 Walpole {{was offered}} a knighthood. He accepted, though confiding to his diary that he could <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a good novelist since Walter Scott who had done so.

500|$|After the Pagan studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly {{published}} {{a summary of}} Voigt's research, Anderson released an open letter dated to August 21, 1991, refuting many of Kelly's claims and referring to it as [...] "the stupid drivel {{of those who have}} only a shallow grasp of their alleged research." [...] He stated that contrary to Kelly's assertions, the Harpy Coven had worshiped a goddess, who was known as Lilith, and that [...] "we did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her as merely the Goddess, but as God Herself".|$|E
500|$|But unlike {{previous}} allegorical literature {{with these}} themes, such as John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1678), Sherwood domesticated her story—all {{of the actions}} in the children's day-to-day lives are of supreme importance because they relate directly to their salvation. Emily, for example, succumbs to the temptation to eat some forbidden plums: “no eye was looking at her, but the eye of God, who sees every thing we do, and knows even the secret thoughts of the heart; but Emily, just at that moment, did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> God." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{starting}} {{out in the}} field of music, he was influenced by brass bands he was involved with and electronic organ music; however, he could <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a specific musician who influenced him. Nakano cites Hamauzu as the colleague he admires most at Square Enix, and is particularly interested in the sounds he creates. When asked about his thoughts of Uematsu and how he had influenced his work, Nakano replied: [...] "He is a very youthful and active person, but he hasn't influenced my work." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{the series}} began, Chris Carter did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{creating}} a [...] "mythology" [...] for the episodes focusing on extraterrestrial life, {{because he felt}} that [...] "they were just stories we wanted to tell". Eventually, however, the writers saw that the most [...] "personal" [...] episodes were those based on the government conspiracy. Another reason {{for the development of}} an ongoing mythology was that the producers were afraid of not creating a thread between the episodes centering on the conspiracy, feeling that it would be pretentious not to do so.|$|E

500|$|Digital Trends's Anthony John Agnello {{wrote that}} [...] "no video game fans have {{suffered}} {{as much as}} EarthBound fans, and cited Nintendo's reluctance to release Mother series games in North America.

Aaron Linde of Shacknews felt that Nintendo's [...] "historic passive-aggression towards EarthBound fans [...] somehow anachronistic" [...] {{in response to the}} outcries from the game's fan community.
