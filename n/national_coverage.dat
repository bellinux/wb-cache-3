25|$|By 1977, CBS' NBA {{schedule}} {{was composed of}} six regionalized telecasts on Sundays. Not only that, the network would air one national game if they felt that match-up itself warranted <b>national</b> <b>coverage.</b> CBS also could stage doubleheaders and switch from a one-sided game to a close one. During this period, the network stopped airing any games during prime time prior to the NBA Finals. Instead, CBS started airing several West Coast games at 11:30p.m. Eastern Time.|$|E

25|$|In late 1972, Cronkite prodded the show's {{producers}} to feature two nights of lengthy explanation on the Watergate scandal, {{which had been}} extensively covered by The Washington Post, but had not received major <b>national</b> <b>coverage.</b> After {{the first half of}} the report, shown on a Friday, ran for 14 minutes – roughly half of the air time of the broadcast – White House officials complained to CBS founder William S. Paley. The second half of the report was aired the following Monday, but only for eight minutes.|$|E

25|$|Bunche {{lived in}} the Kew Gardens {{neighborhood}} of Queens, New York, in a home purchased with his Nobel Prize money, from 1953 until his death. Like many other people of color, Bunche continued to struggle against racism across the United States and sometimes in his own neighborhood. In 1959, he and his son, Ralph, Jr., were denied membership in the West Side Tennis Club in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens. After the issue was given <b>national</b> <b>coverage</b> by the press, the club offered the Bunches an apology and invitation of membership. The official who had rebuffed them resigned. Bunche refused the offer, saying it was not based on racial equality and was an exception based only on his personal prestige.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{it is best}} to use the TDWR in {{conjunction}} with a traditional NEXRAD nearby to ensure that nothing is missed. In contrast to NEXRAD, which has <b>national</b> <b>coverage</b> of the contiguous United States (although with some holes due to terrain), TDWR has sporadic coverage meant for major airports. While certain areas of the country (the Northeast megalopolis, the states of Ohio and Florida, and the southwestern quarter of Tornado Alley in Oklahoma and Texas) have a high density of TDWR units, others (the entire West Coast, the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, portions of the Deep South, and a stretch running from northern Pennsylvania through upstate New York and into northern New England) have no TDWR coverage at all.|$|E

25|$|Dirkhising's death {{received}} only regional media coverage until a Washington Times article {{ran a story}} nearly a month after his death, noting the lack of <b>national</b> <b>coverage</b> in contrast to that given to the 1998 death of Matthew Shepard. The Shepard murder was approaching its first anniversary and was getting another round of national attention, coupled with updates on pending hate crime legislation. Prompted by coverage in The Washington Times, the Dirkhising case gained notoriety as conservative commentators compared {{media coverage of the}} two cases and explored the issues of what was considered a hate crime. The added attention resulted in mainstream media also reporting the Dirkhising case in relation to the coverage of the Shepard case, with many attempting to explain why the two were handled differently by the media, and perhaps received differently by readers.|$|E
25|$|NASCAR had few {{televised}} {{races in}} 1972. Those races that did {{air in the}} 1970s were mixed into shows like ABC Wide World of Sports. France signed a deal with CBS Sports' president Neal Pilson to televise the 1979 Daytona 500 from flag to flag. The race was the first live flag to flag <b>national</b> <b>coverage</b> of a NASCAR race. The race got high television ratings, partly due to a snowstorm in the Midwest and Northeast. Richard Petty won the race after race leaders Donnie Allison and Cale Yarborough crashed together on the final lap. Allison's brother Bobby Allison stopped, and Bobby Allison and Yarborough then exchanged punches. The ratings and ensuing press coverage helped France to sign television contracts with ESPN in 1980, TNN in 1990, and TBS. France's career culminated in a record-setting $2.4 billion television broadcasting contract in 1999 for the 2001 season.|$|E
25|$|Cranston Public Library has {{received}} regional and <b>national</b> <b>coverage</b> and recognition. In 2014, {{in response to}} Rhode Island’s having the highest statewide unemployment rate in the nation, the Cranston Public Library, Providence Public Library, and other organizations developed Rhode Island Adult Lifelong Learning (ALL) Access, a computer training and workforce development program offered through the libraries’ learning lounges, dedicated drop-in computer spaces staffed by an adult educator and volunteers. In the Spring of 2015, Cranston Public Library was named Library of the Year by the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Library and Information Studies for its contributions to public library service. In June 2015, Cranston Public Library was acknowledged by the Holocaust Education and Resource Center of Rhode Island (HERCRI) with a Mitzvah (or “Good Deeds”) Award in recognition of an ongoing collaboration between the two organizations. Cranston Public Library was also named a recipient of the 2016 LibraryAware Community Award for its efforts to bring library services to new immigrants moving into Cranston.|$|E
