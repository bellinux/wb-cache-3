40|$|The Natural Resources Conservation Service Curve Number (NRCS-CN) {{method is}} highly {{recommended}} for runoff prediction in many climate conditions. The key parameters to obtain CN values are hydrologic soil groups {{and land use}} information with respect to soil moisture conditions. This method {{has been well documented}} and available in many popular rainfall-runoff models such as HEC-HMS, Mike, SWAT and many more. It is also easy to implement due to availability of required data in many countries. However, it is criticized in a way that NRCS-CN do {{not take into account the}} effect of terrain slope and drainage area. This study aimed to investigate the effect of slope on CN and the way that slope could change the domain of CN values in Kuantan River Basin (KRB), Malaysia. The Huang and Sharply-Williams methods were used to investigate the changes on CN values provided in <b>National</b> <b>Handbook</b> of Engineering. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) version 2 was used to derive slope map with spatial resolution of 30 m for the study area. The study significantly enhanced the application of GIS tools and recent advances in earth observation technology in order to analyze hydrological process with respect to spatial dimension...|$|E

40|$|Discussed are {{a variety}} of {{remotely}} sensed data sources that may have utility in the identification of conservation practices and related linear features. Test sites were evaluated in Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma using one or more of a variety of remotely sensed data sources, including color infrared photography (CIR), LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) data, and aircraft-acquired Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner (TIMS) data. Both visual examination and computer-implemented enhancement procedures were used to identify conservation practices and other linear features. For the Kansas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma test sites, photo interpretations of CIR identified up to 24 of the 109 conservation practices from a matrix derived from the SCS <b>National</b> <b>Handbook</b> of Conservation Practices. The conservation practice matrix was modified to predict the possibility of identifying the 109 practices at various photographic scales based on the observed results as well as photo interpreter experience. Some practices were successfully identified in TM data through visual identification, but a number of existing practices were of such size and shape that the resolution of the TM could not detect them accurately. A series of computer-automated decorrelation and filtering procedures served to enhance the conservation practices in TM data with only fair success. However, features such as field boundaries, roads, water bodies, and the Urban/Ag interface were easily differentiated. Similar enhancement techniques applied to 5 and 10 meter TIMS data proved much more useful in delineating terraces, grass waterways, and drainage ditches as well as the features mentioned above, due partly to improved resolution and partly to thermally influenced moisture conditions. Spatially oriented data such as those derived from remotely sensed data offer some promise in the inventory and monitoring of conservation practices as well as in supplying parameter data for a variety of computer-implemented agricultural models...|$|E

It also compares the actually calculated CN with its values provided in the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) <b>National</b> Engineering <b>Handbook</b> Section 4 : Hydrology (NEH- 4) and Technical Release 20 (TR- 20). The analysis showed that empirical CN values presented in the <b>National</b> Engineering <b>Handbook</b> tables differed from the actually observed values. Calculations revealed a strong correlation between the observed CN and precipitation (P). In three of the analyzed watersheds, a typical pattern of the observed CN stabilization during abundant precipitation was perceived. It was found that Model 2, based on a kinetics equation, most effectively described the P-CN relationship. In most cases, the observed CN in the investigated watersheds was similar to the empirical CN, corresponding to average moisture conditions set out by NEH- 4. Model 2 also provided the greatest stability of CN at 90 % sampled event rainfall...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the status, gaps and challenges of continuous assessment (CA) practices of primary and junior secondary school teachers in Nigeria. A large- scale survey was conducted on {{a random sample of}} 3, 325 teachers (2, 185 primary school teachers and 1, 140 junior secondary schools teachers) across the six (6) geo-political zones of the country. The survey sought information from the school teachers on their understanding of the CA as well as the appropriate application of the CA instruments, whether there are uniform CA guidelines across the country and how school teachers engage in CA practices. Results showed that in general school teachers demonstrated poor knowledge of the elementary concept of CA. Many teachers misapplied the CA instruments leading to more of continuous testing of learners instead of continuous assessment. CA guidelines not only varied across states and schools but were also different from the guidelines stipulated in the extant <b>national</b> CA <b>handbook.</b> School teachers are to be mandatorily and formally trained in CA principles and practice both at pre-service and in-service levels...|$|R
