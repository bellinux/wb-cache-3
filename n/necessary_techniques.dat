5|$|Japan has a {{comprehensive}} network of legislation for protecting, preserving, and classifying its cultural patrimony. The regard for physical and intangible properties and their protection {{is typical of}} Japanese preservation and restoration practices. Methods of protecting designated National Treasures include restrictions on alterations, transfer, and export, as well as financial support {{in the form of}} grants and tax reduction. The Agency for Cultural Affairs provides owners with advice on restoration, administration, and public display of the properties. These efforts are supplemented by laws that protect the built environment of designated structures and the <b>necessary</b> <b>techniques</b> for restoration of works.|$|E
25|$|Experiments in knapping have {{demonstrated}} the relative ease with which a hand axe can be made, which could help explain their success. In addition, they demand relatively little maintenance and allow a choice of raw materials–any rock will suffice that supports a conchoidal fracture. It is easy to improvise their manufacture and correct mistakes without requiring detailed planning. No long or demanding apprenticeship is necessary to learn the <b>necessary</b> <b>techniques.</b> These factors combine to allow these objects to remain in use throughout pre-history. Their adaptability makes them effective {{in a variety of}} tasks, from heavy duty such as digging in soil, felling trees or breaking bones to delicate such as cutting ligaments, slicing meat or perforating a variety of materials.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} century, {{molybdenum}} had no industrial use. [...] It was relatively scarce, the pure metal {{was difficult to}} extract, and the <b>necessary</b> <b>techniques</b> of metallurgy were immature. Early molybdenum steel alloys showed great promise of increased hardness, but efforts to manufacture the alloys {{on a large scale}} were hampered with inconsistent results, a tendency toward brittleness, and recrystallization. In 1906, William D. Coolidge filed a patent for rendering molybdenum ductile, leading to applications as a heating element for high-temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten-filament light bulbs; oxide formation and degradation require that molybdenum be physically sealed or held in an inert gas. In 1913, Frank E. Elmore developed a froth flotation process to recover molybdenite from ores; flotation remains the primary isolation process.|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, the {{objective}} assessment cannot exhaust the nuances and {{variability in the}} results of techniques that aim at visual appeal to human observers, inherently ambiguous and subjective. This aspect does not invalidate {{the objective}} evaluation held earlier, but raises the need for finding a method or tool {{in order to better}} evaluate those nuances. Subjective evaluation appears as a second <b>necessary</b> <b>technique</b> for evaluation.|$|R
40|$|Modifications to fast {{correlation}} {{attacks on}} stream ciphers are investigated. Improvements are achieved with both deterministic and random choices for updates of the corresponding posterior probabilities and with fast and partial resetting methods. The use of simulated annealing and appropriate optimisation heuristics is also proposed and successful experimental results are obtained.

There are three types of recognition: individual recognition, collective recognition, and group recognition. Special grants of two million yen a year are given to individual holders (the so-called National Living Treasures) to help protect these properties. The government also contributes part of the expenses incurred either by the holder of the Intangible Cultural Property during training of his successor, or by a recognized group for public performances.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, {{air superiority}} and an [...] "offensive" [...] {{strategy}} facilitated the greatly increased {{involvement of the}} RFC in the battle itself, in what was known {{at the time as}} [...] "trench strafing" [...] – in modern terms, close support. For the rest of the war, this became a regular routine, with both attacking and defending infantry in a land battle being constantly liable to attack by machine guns and light bombs from the air. At this time, counter fire from the ground was far less effective than it became later, when the <b>necessary</b> <b>techniques</b> of deflection shooting had been mastered.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, a study {{conducted}} on the relations between members of UNIFIL and local population in Lebanon, carried out by Heiberg and Holst, all but confirmed the findings. In their example, {{they found that the}} countries that were able to integrate more fully with the population and show a depth of knowledge about the local culture were more successful, while those that were ambitious, but less integrated into the local scene found themselves far removed from the individuals with which {{they were supposed to be}} engaged with, and their success, or lack thereof, illustrated this.Only the Italian contingent of some 2,200 people operated as part of the local environment and became an active element in restoring normal living conditions. Its soldiers were provided with the training required to acquaint them with the cultural, political and social situation of the people among whom they worked. Operating in a sector that contained approximately 600,000 inhabitants, mostly Shi'ites, the Italians carefully nurtured contact with the ordinary citizens and the political leaders in their area... While the Americans thought they were becoming involved in Lebanese politics, they entered into Lebanese culture and history with little or no understanding of the way things worked-- or didn't work... Most Americans did not understand the subtleties of short-term alliances, the length of memories and blood feuds, the strength of aln [...] in Arab culture nor the nuances of religious differences.This illustrates the importance of understanding the significance that culture plays in the conduct of successful peacekeeping operations. However, despite the existence of a UN training manual that attempts to advise peacekeepers on <b>necessary</b> <b>techniques,</b> there is no unifying doctrine, or standardised procedure among peacekeeping contingents, which will ultimately hinder the potential for success.|$|E

Contrast administration is not <b>necessary.</b> <b>Technique</b> should be standard for chest CT (typically 120  kV and automatic exposure control for mA). If significant air trapping is suspected, limited expiratory images can be obtained at 20 -mm intervals from the apex to the diaphragm.|$|R

50|$|As {{the first}} {{aircraft}} carriers became operational {{in the early}} 1920s, they learned the <b>necessary</b> <b>techniques</b> for storing, launching, recovering, and servicing aircraft at sea. Early fleet exercises demonstrated the ability of aircraft to extend effective gunnery range from 20000 yd to 24000 yd. Theorists suggested the possibility of denying that advantage to the enemy by using fighters to shoot down enemy aircraft, and predicted tactical advantages for the fleet able to launch the larger number of aircraft. Aircraft carriers embarked as many aircraft as possible to maximize mission effectiveness and sustained mission capability through anticipated operational losses of aircraft.|$|E
