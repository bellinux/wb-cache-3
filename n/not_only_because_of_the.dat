5|$|The {{city walls}} have been {{preserved}} {{to the present}} day, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knowledge of the skilled construction workers and the constant care provided by city dwellers that maintained and rebuilt the structures as needed, {{but also because of}} the brilliantly reputed diplomacy in Ragusa, which managed on many occasions to avoid dangerous measures taken by enemies against the Republic of Ragusa.|$|E
5|$|Betances' {{last days}} were chaotic, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{events in the}} Caribbean, {{but also because of}} what {{happening}} in his own household. Jiménez' mental state is reported as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a morphine addict (unlikely) by then, and she even wished for her husband to die in tantrums reported by his doctors. Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances' intelligence dossiers, as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, which they did until he died.|$|E
5|$|Several nearby office blocks {{were hit}} {{so badly that}} almost every window, front and back, was blown in as the {{explosion}} ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof {{of at least one}} house was blown off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.|$|E
2500|$|... "Jean Metzinger" [...] writes Daniel Robbins [...] "was at {{the center}} <b>of</b> Cubism, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his role as {{intermediary}} among the orthodox Montmartre group and right bank or Passy Cubists, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his great identification with the movement when it was recognized, but above all <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his artistic personality. His concerns were balanced; he was deliberately {{at the intersection of}} high intellectuality and the passing spectacle." ...|$|R

5|$|The fiddle, and {{traditional}} music in general, remained popular in Donegal <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international coverage of certain artists {{but because of}} local pride in the music. Traditional music Seisiúns are still common place both in pubs and in houses. The Donegal fiddle music has been influenced by recorded music, but this is claimed {{to have had a}} positive impact on the tradition. Modern Donegal fiddle music is often played in concerts and recorded on albums.|$|E
5|$|Two {{sites were}} chosen to {{study the effects of}} cane toads on the {{northern}} quoll, one of which was at Mary River ranger station, which is located in the southern region of Kakadu National Park. The other site was located {{at the north end of}} the park. In addition to these two sites, there was a third site located at the East Alligator ranger station, and this site was used as a control site, where the cane toads would not interact with the northern quoll population. Monitoring of the quoll population began at the Mary River ranger station using radio tracking in 2002, months before the first cane toads arrived at the site. After the arrival of the cane toads, the population of northern quolls in the Mary River site plummeted between October and December 2002, and by March 2003, the northern quoll appeared to be extinct in this section of the park, as there were no northern quolls caught in the trapping trips in the following two months. In contrast, the population of northern quolls in the control site at the East Alligator ranger station remained relatively constant, not showing any symptoms of declining. The evidence from the Kakadu National Park is compelling <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> timing of the population of northern quolls plummeting just months after the arrival of the cane toad, but also because in the Mary River region 31% of mortalities within the quoll population were attributed to lethal toxic ingestion, as there were no signs of disease, parasite infestation, or any other obvious changes at the site that could have caused such a rapid decline. The most obvious piece of evidence which supports the hypothesis that the invasion of the cane toads caused the local extinction of the northern quoll is that the closely monitored population of the control group, in the absence of cane toads, showed no signs of decline.|$|E

25|$|The Italians had {{numerical}} superiority {{but this}} advantage was lost, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difficult terrain {{in which the}} fighting took place, {{but also because of}} the strategies and tactics employed.

25|$|Formulas (16) are {{approximate}} <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approximate definitions (2) and (3) {{for coupling}} coefficients were used. Exact expressions for the coupling coefficients in prototype filter were obtained in. However both former and refined formulae remain approximate in designing practical filters. The accuracy depends on both filter structure and resonator structure. The accuracy improves when the fractional bandwidth narrows.|$|E

25|$|The Carnot {{cycle is}} the most {{efficient}} possible engine, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> (trivial) absence of friction and other incidental wasteful processes; the main reason is that it assumes no conduction of heat between parts of the engine at different temperatures. Carnot knew that the conduction of heat between bodies at different temperatures is a wasteful and irreversible process, which must be eliminated if the heat engine is to achieve maximum efficiency.|$|E

For this reason, the wreck site and the event itself is very important to the community of the lower Yorke Peninsula, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disastrous loss of life, but also because they played a major role in aiding the survivors. Even to this day, if you visit the graves, there are fresh flowers near the headstones.|$|E
