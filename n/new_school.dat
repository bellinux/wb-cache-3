5|$|A {{majority}} of Old School {{leaders in the}} North were convinced of the orthodoxy of the <b>New</b> <b>School.</b> Some within the Old School, chiefly Princeton theologian Charles Hodge, claimed that there were still ministers within the <b>New</b> <b>School</b> who adhered to New Haven theology. Nevertheless, the Old and <b>New</b> <b>School</b> General Assemblies in the North and a {{majority of}} their presbyteries approved the reunion in 1869 of the PCUSA.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, <b>New</b> <b>School</b> Presbyterians in the North {{had moved}} to more {{moderate}} positions and reasserted a stronger Presbyterian identity. This was helped in 1852 when the Plan of Union between the <b>New</b> <b>School</b> Church and the Congregationalists was discontinued. Northern Presbyterian's of both the Old and <b>New</b> <b>School</b> participated in the Christian Commission that provided religious and social services to Union soldiers during the Civil War. Furthermore, both schools boldly proclaimed the righteousness of the Union cause and engaged in speculation {{about the role of}} a newly restored America in ushering in the millennium. This was, in effect, the Old School's repudiation of its teaching against involving the church in political affairs.|$|E
5|$|Developments in the New York <b>new</b> <b>school</b> {{continuum}} in {{this climate}} were represented by the Native Tongues groups—The Jungle Brothers, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Queen Latifah and Monie Love—along with fellow travellers like Leaders of the <b>New</b> <b>School,</b> KMD and Brand Nubian. They moved away from aggressive, macho posturing, towards ambiguity, fun and Afrocentricity. Their music was sample-crowded, more open and accessible than their <b>new</b> <b>school</b> predecessors. De La Soul's debut sampled everyone from The Turtles to Steely Dan, while A Tribe Called Quest matched tough beats to mellow jazz samples and playful, thoughtful raps.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the role of parents in the {{planning}} and setting up of <b>new</b> secondary <b>schools</b> in the context of proposals to extend the right of parents in relation to <b>new</b> <b>schools.</b> The research focused on 15 parent campaigns that had recently taken place or were ongoing: seven aimed to obtain <b>new</b> <b>schools</b> and eight to prevent <b>new</b> <b>schools</b> being set up. Interviews were carried out with members of the campaigns, local authority officials, academy sponsors and a DfES official. Issues and barriers associated with the campaigns are explored. Amongst the most significant were access to information; lack of expertise; government policies and priorities; local authority priorities and attitudes; and lack of sites for <b>new</b> <b>schools.</b> The paper argues that whilst these barriers need to be addressed if parents are to have a greater role in relation to setting up <b>new</b> <b>schools,</b> tensions exist between government policies, creating difficulties for policies in this area to be effectively implemented...|$|R
5|$|Heresy {{trials of}} {{prominent}} <b>New</b> <b>School</b> leaders further deepened the division within the denomination. Both the Presbytery and Synod of Philadelphia found Albert Barnes, pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, guilty of heresy. Old School Presbyterians, however, were outraged when the <b>New</b> <b>School</b> dominated General Assembly of 1831 dismissed the charges. Lyman Beecher, famous revivalist, moral reformer {{and president of}} the newly established Lane Theological Seminary, was charged with heresy in 1835 but was also acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding the General Assembly's {{attempt to}} promote peace and unity, two {{distinct}} factions, the Old School and the <b>New</b> <b>School,</b> developed through the 1820s over {{the issues of}} confessional subscription, revivalism, {{and the spread of}} New England theology. The <b>New</b> <b>School</b> faction advocated revivalism and New England theology, while the Old School was opposed to the extremes of revivalism and desired strict conformity to the Westminster Confession. The ideological center of Old School Presbyterianism was Princeton Theological Seminary, which under the leadership of Archibald Alexander and Charles Hodge became associated with a brand of Reformed scholasticism known as Princeton Theology.|$|E

5|$|The <b>new</b> <b>school</b> of hip hop was a {{movement}} in hip hop music starting 1983–84 with the early records of Run–D.M.C. and LL Cool J. Like the hip hop preceding it, it came predominantly from New York City. The <b>new</b> <b>school</b> was initially characterized in form by drum machine led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock. It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song its artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with the funk and disco influenced outfits, novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of artists prevalent in 1984, and rendered them old school. <b>New</b> <b>school</b> artists made shorter songs that could more easily gain radio play, and more cohesive LPs than their old school counterparts. By 1986 their releases began to establish the hip hop album as a fixture of the mainstream.|$|E

However, <b>new</b> <b>schools</b> at all three levels tend to become quickly overcrowded (Robinson High School, built for 1,500 students, opened in the fall of 2005 with nearly 1,800 students enrolled). Therefore, <b>new</b> <b>schools</b> are being constantly planned and added, with eight <b>new</b> <b>schools</b> having been constructed since 1996 (plus four new buildings for outdated existing schools). The 2016-17 school year will see the opening of another <b>new</b> elementary <b>school,</b> the Odell 3-5 building, which will be contructed on the old Odell site.
