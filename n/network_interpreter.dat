40|$|This study {{evaluated}} and optimized {{the performance of}} an automated artificial neural <b>network</b> image <b>interpreter</b> in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism on ventilation– perfusion lung scans. The computer interpretations were compared with the interpretations of three experienced observers. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Digital data were obtained from 100 patients with normal findings on chest radiographs who were undergoing both radionuclide ventilation–perfusion scanning and pulmonary angiography. Interpretations of differently trained neural networks were {{compared with those of}} three experienced nuclear medicine practitioners unaware of the clinical diagnosis. RESULTS. Machines running neural networks performed similarly to experienced scan interpreters in the detection of pulmonary embolism. Both the human observers and the networks performed best in cases with large emboli. Neural network performance was best in the right lung, when the networks were trained using only cases with large emboli and when network...|$|R
40|$|WAVE is {{a system}} based {{on the concept of}} mobile objects {{propagating}} asynchronously through a <b>network</b> of <b>interpreters.</b> We demonstrate how this computational paradigm can be used to simulate the movement of physical objects through a 2 -dimensional space. Our approach maps the simulated space, consisting of a line segment database that is stored using a PM 1 quadtree, onto a collection of interpreters of the WAVE language. The simulated objects are programs carried on messages that physically migrate through the underlying space and carry along their entire behavior. We describe the implementation of several basic behaviors of such autonomous mobile objects e. g., following a given line segment, moving in a certain direction, or searching for information in the object's vicinity. INTRODUCTION Recent simulation efforts have recognized the need to permit the human operator to interact with a simulation while it is in progress, thus controlling the process dynamically as it unfolds. A typic [...] ...|$|R

To {{still be able}} to collect specimen of Japanese plants and animals as well as to gather information on the population, Thunberg soon began to systematically construct <b>networks</b> with the <b>interpreters</b> by sending them small notes containing medical knowledge and receiving botanical knowledge or rare Japanese coins in return. Quickly, the news spread that a well-educated Dutch physician was in town who seemed {{to be able to help}} the local doctors cure the Dutch disease, another word for syphilis. As a result, the appropriate authorities granted him more and more visits to the city and finally even allowed him one-day trips into the vicinity of Nagasaki where Thunberg had the chance to collect specimen by himself.|$|R
40|$|Interpreters {{who work}} in {{community}} settings were surveyed in a worldwide study conducted in 1998 - 99. The aim of the survey was to gain insight from the interpreters’ perspective {{into the nature of}} community-based interpreting (CBI). Subjects were approached through interpreter associations (Critical Link and other <b>network)</b> worldwide. Practising <b>interpreters</b> were asked to give factual details of their work, languages, experience, and training, and to express their views on their role, working conditions, and status. They were also asked to identify qualities and skills needed for CBI and the guiding principles underlying their work. Most survey questions were open-ended to give respondents the opportunity to express their thoughts more fully. The final sample of 92 interpreters, mainly working in government settings, came from seven different countries. Survey findings answered some of the questions initially raised, and the results are presented in this report. 20 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{high-level}} organizational {{approach is}} offered based on grasping top mission semantics and overall system functionality {{in a special}} high-level language, which allows most of traditional management routines, command and control including, to be effectively shifted to automated up to fully automatic levels. This “spatial grasp ” language is collectively interpreted by a dynamic <b>network</b> of communicating <b>interpreters</b> embedded into key system points, in open or stealth mode. This allows us to concentrate on global mission goals and overall system efficiency and timely react on unpredictable and asymmetric situations and events. The technology offered having a ubiquitous super-virus feature with extended capability of self-recovery can create runtime intelligent spatial infrastructures governing distributed systems or penetrate into existing infrastructures investigating their origin, weak and strong points, and providing the impact needed. The approach also allows us to naturally engage robotic components in the force mix under automatic command and control resulting from parallel and distributed language interpretation, with unified transition to fully unmanned systems...|$|R
40|$|There {{is such a}} {{large amount}} of varied {{information}} available on the Internet that it is hard for a human to query this information without efficient tools. Using structured relational data can greatly improve our ability to search for data and data compute new information across networks. The McMaster University Software Engineering Research Group (McSERG) proposes to use binary relations to organise data on networks and use binary relation operations to do information query. A new language, Data Network Language (DNL) [16], has been developed by McSERG to apply this idea. This thesis presents the design and development of the Data <b>Network</b> Language <b>Interpreter</b> System, which is the implementation of DNL. By means of examples, this thesis shows how the use of DNL can improve the consistency and completeness in information retrieve. i Acknowledgements I would like to express my sincere thanks to Dr. David L. Parnas for his guidance, advice, and enthusiasm throughout this thesis. He brought the new idea to use binary relations on the Internet technology to us which has {{played a major role in}} this work. Without his constant support and encouragement, it would have been impossible for me to finish this work. A great deal of help, and many valuable suggestions and comments for this work from Dr. Ridha Khedri are highly appreciated. I would also like to thank Dr. Stavros Kolliopoulos reading this thesis and making very helpful suggestions.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this master's thesis is new {{technologies}} and social networking sites {{in the field of}} interpreting. The theoretical part discusses how, over the course of time, technological advances have altered not only the face of interpreting itself but also the way interpreters work, and presented them with new possibilities. This part also briefly deals with the history and functioning of social networks, namely Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn and examines the possibilities social networking sites offer in terms of marketing. The empirical part presents conclusions drawn from the study. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine general tendencies in the use of {{new technologies and}} social <b>networks</b> by Czech <b>interpreters.</b> The questionnaire distributed online focused mainly on the following points: ownership of smartphones and tablets, awareness of technical novelties in interpreting, use of social networks for professional and marketing purposes. A total of 150 people took part in the study. The analysis of collected answers revealed that the number of tablet or smartphone owners amongst the participants is quite high, that participants are skeptical towards nontraditional ways of interpreting and that interpreters use social networking sites rather for communicating within the interpreting community [...] ...|$|R
40|$|There is wide {{consensus}} that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is able to exert cognitive control on behavior by biasing processing toward task-relevant information and by modulating response selection. This idea is typically framed in terms of top-down influences within a cortical control hierarchy, where prefrontal-basal ganglia loops gate multiple input-output channels, which in turn can activate or sequence motor primitives expressed in (pre-) motor cortices. Here we advance a new hypothesis, based {{on the notion of}} programmability and an interpreter-programmer computational scheme, on how the PFC can flexibly bias the selection of sensorimotor patterns depending on internal goal and task contexts. In this approach, multiple elementary behaviors representing motor primitives are expressed by a single multi-purpose neural network, which is seen as a reusable area of "recycled" neurons (interpreter). The PFC thus acts as a "programmer" that, without modifying the network connectivity, feeds the <b>interpreter</b> <b>networks</b> with specific input parameters encoding the programs (corresponding to network structures) to be interpreted by the (pre-) motor areas. Our architecture is validated in a standard test for executive function: the 1 - 2 -AX task. Our results show that this computational framework provides a robust, scalable and flexible scheme that can be iterated at different hierarchical layers, supporting the realization of multiple goals. We discuss the plausibility of the "programmer-interpreter" scheme to explain the functioning of prefrontal-(pre) motor cortical hierarchie...|$|R
40|$|Context: South Asians are {{the largest}} {{immigrant}} group in Ontario, Canada. They may express perceptions of pregnancy that differ from the dominant cultures influencing mainstream health care. Prenatal services are underutilized by immigrant women {{in part due to}} language barriers and issues of racism. Purpose: To explore and understand South Asian Canadian women's pregnancy needs and experiences in utilizing prenatal health services in Ottawa, Canada. Method: Ten women were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed using content and thematic analysis following a descriptive exploratory qualitative approach. An anti-racist approach was used to gain insights about these women's perspectives on the use of prenatal health services. Results: All women expressed that their husbands provided support and nurturance. Female elders including mothers, South Asian neighbours, and friends {{played an important role in}} providing pregnancy information and support. Almost all participants were not aware of available community-based resources, including prenatal programs. Almost all women expressed that they were given different treatment, ignored by administrative staff and/or perceived that health care providers spent less time with them compared to other Canadians. Some health care providers did not understand and respect cultural and religious rituals. Conclusions: Providing information about the availability of community resources is a vital step. Exploring South Asian husband's perspectives, the potential use of internet resources and creating <b>interpreter</b> <b>networks</b> through Indo-Canadian organizations are recommended. The Canadian health care system needs to address barriers and racism encountered by South Asian women to provide culturally sensitive health care...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the various}} drivers of {{innovation}} have been discussed extensively by innovation scholars, design has only recently been acknowledged as a possible driver of innovation. This study builds on the study by Roberto Verganti (Verganti, 2008) on the Design Driven Innovation process and elaborates on the existing framework for this process. The framework on the Design Driven Innovation process suggests that upcoming innovations or changes in sociocultural context and technology are first picked up by interpreters who create visions. These visions are used by companies to create innovative products which are used by users in the sociocultural context. Therefore {{there should be a}} delay between the moment interpreters start discussing a topic and the moment it is picked up by the sociocultural context. This delay is equal to the time it takes a company to develop the vision from the interpreters into a product for the users. This consequence of the framework is tested in this study. The output from a group interpreters in the International Journal of Vehicle Design is analyzed and compared to the output of the sociocultural context, which is represented by newspaper articles in the New York Times. Word co-occurrence networks are used to identify the topic of the discussion at a certain point in time. Of the 12 identified topics, 8 topics show the expected delays. The total of 18 observed delays average at 5 years which is consistent with the expected time a company needs to develop a product. The main conclusion in this study is that an analysis of interpreters in an <b>interpreter</b> <b>network</b> may indeed provide useful information on changes in the sociocultural context and could thus be used to anticipate change. However, the limited amount of observed topics make future research in this field necessary...|$|R
