The present paper reviews a French approach of <b>nutrient</b> <b>profiling</b> by describing the SAIN,LIM system and its evolution from its early draft to the simplified nutrition labelling system (SENS) algorithm. Considered in 2010 by WHO as the 'French model' of <b>nutrient</b> <b>profiling,</b> SAIN,LIM classifies foods into four classes based on two scores: a nutrient density score (NDS) called SAIN and a score of nutrients to limit called LIM, and one threshold on each score. The system was first developed by the French Food Standard Agency in 2008 in response to the European regulation on nutrition and health claims (European Commission (EC) 1924 / 2006) to determine foods that may be eligible for bearing claims. Recently, the European regulation (EC 1169 / 2011) on the provision of food information to consumers allowed simplified nutrition labelling to facilitate consumer information and help them make fully informed choices. In that context, the SAIN,LIM was adapted to obtain the SENS algorithm, a system able to rank foods for simplified nutrition labelling. The implementation of the algorithm followed a step-by-step, systematic, transparent and logical process where shortcomings of the SAIN,LIM were addressed by integrating specificities of food categories in the SENS, reducing the number of nutrients, ordering the four classes and introducing European reference intakes. Through the French example, this review shows how an existing <b>nutrient</b> <b>profiling</b> system can be specifically adapted to support public health nutrition policies...|$|R
40|$|Mid 2006, the French Nutrition Institute (IFN) {{established}} {{a task force}} to work on the emerging concept of “nutrient profiles”, introduced in the european regulation under negotiation at that time. A first symposium allowed to explore further development of the concept, beyond science (FUFOSE and PASSCLAIM programs) and moral standards. Meanwhile, <b>nutrient</b> <b>profiles</b> have been included in the adopted Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of the EU on nutrition and health claims made on foods, though their technical basis still remains to be established. First searching for criteria that would satisfy the definition of the food categories, the IFN task force sought to collect objective data on the specific features of the various food categories, with regard to intrinsic nutritional characteristics, the benefit and role in the diet, the potential for optimisation and the possible consequences on nutritional allowances, and regulatory considerations. The task force also compared the outcomes of several <b>nutrient</b> <b>profiling</b> systems on the eligibility to claims of several hundreds of “real” food products, which confirmed that the choice of one system might make a lot of difference, according to the type of products. Last November, IFN organized a second symposium on <b>nutrient</b> <b>profiles</b> to take stock of the breakthroughs and expectations of the various actors involved in Europe. The original studies in progress at IFN have been presented on this occasion. Given as an introduction of this second symposium by the President of IFN, the paper below recalls the main objectives of this new Regulation. It also insists on the conditions of credibility of <b>nutrient</b> <b>profiles</b> that need to be easily understood by consumers, and should not be suspected to serve other intentions. Additional reserves are expressed, due to the difficulty of <b>nutrient</b> <b>profiling,</b> to the danger of a possible manipulation of the consumer behaviour, and to the risk of an excessive medicalization of human nutrition...|$|R
40|$|On the 14 June 2013 the Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation {{endorsed}} {{the use of}} the Health Star Rating; a voluntary front-of-pack label (FoPL) to be used on all packaged foods sold in Australia. The FoPL uses stars to rate the food, where more stars indicate a better nutritional choice. The purpose of the FoPL is to assist consumers in making healthier food choices and contribute to reducing the burden of chronic disease in Australia. It is therefore essential that the FoPL correctly classifies foods. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the accuracy of the new FoPL by reviewing the literature on the <b>nutrient</b> <b>profiling</b> model that underpins the Health Star Rating.

40|$|Background: This thesis {{investigates the}} <b>nutrient</b> <b>profiling</b> models of ten {{different}} transnational companies, presented through the EU Pledge. The profiling models may be developed internally by the companies, {{and are used}} to categorise foods according to their nutritional composition – drawing lines between what is healthy and what is not. On {{the basis of this}} demarcation, the profiling models determine which products are eligible to be advertised to children. Considering the profitability of marketing, the companies have a clear vested interest in setting lenient criteria. How does that affect the research? Objective: Through looking at how information is transmitted and interpreted, thus framed, I aim to investigate whether the ten studied <b>nutrient</b> <b>profiling</b> models are valid, efficient and transparent, or if they are strategically and pragmatically construed on an ad hoc basis. Methods: This is a comparative multiple case study, a qualitative document analysis with an open-ended and exploratory design. Findings: The analysis suggests that the models undoubtedly contain elements of clear strategic framing, and found indications that the science on which they are based is chosen pragmatically to suit specific portfolio brands. Conclusion: If the EU Pledge is to support parents in making the right diet and lifestyle choices for their children, it needs a more standardised, transparent, and uniform approach, ensuring conformity and quality assurance.
