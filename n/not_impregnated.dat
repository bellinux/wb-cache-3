Always easy, always lucid, always correct, we may find them; but who is the writer, easy, lucid, and correct, who has <b>not</b> <b>impregnated</b> his writing with {{something}} of that personal flavour which we call mannerism? To speak of authors well known to all readers--Does not The Rambler taste of Johnson; The Decline and Fall, of Gibbon; The Middle Ages, of Hallam; The History of England, of Macaulay; and The Invasion of the Crimea, of Kinglake?

I have sometimes thought that Swift has been nearest to the mark of any,--writing English and not writing Swift. But I doubt whether an accurate observer would not trace even here the [...] "mark of the beast." [...] Thackeray, too, has a strong flavour of Thackeray. I am inclined to think that his most besetting sin in style,--the little earmark by which he is most conspicuous,--is a certain affected familiarity. He indulges too frequently in little confidences with individual readers, in which pretended allusions to himself are frequent. [...] "What would you do? what would you say now, if you were in such a position?" [...] he asks. He describes this practice of his in the preface to Pendennis. [...] "It is a sort of confidential talk between writer and reader.... In the course of his volubility the perpetual speaker must of necessity lay bare his own weaknesses, vanities, peculiarities." [...] In the short contributions to periodicals on which he tried his 'prentice hand, such addresses and conversations were natural and efficacious; but in a larger work of fiction they cause an absence of that dignity to which even a novel may aspire. You feel that each morsel as you read it is a detached bit, and that it has all been written in detachments. The book is robbed of its integrity by a certain good-humoured geniality of language, which causes the reader to be almost too much at home with his author. There is a saying that familiarity breeds contempt, and I have been sometimes inclined to think that our author has sometimes failed to stand up for himself with sufficiency of [...] "personal deportment." ...|$|E

Transmission electron microscopy revealed that in vessels and fi bres wound reaction compounds are deposited in the lumen as balloon-like structures and/or as wall attachments. Parenchyma cells frequently show atypical innermost wall layers, either similar to regular wall layers or as a nearly electron transparent structure resembling suberinised cell wall layers. UV-microspectrophotometry allowed for a closer chemical characterisation of the wound reaction compounds.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{rigorous}} {{investigation into the}} detailed structure of nanoparticles already shown to be successful drug delivery nanocarriers. The basic structure of the drug conjugates consists of an N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer bearing the anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) bound via a pH-sensitive hydrazone bond and a defined amount of cholesterol moieties that vary in hydrophobicity. The results show that size, anisotropy, and aggregation number N(aggr) of the nanoparticles grows with increasing cholesterol content. From ab initio calculations, we conclude that the most probable structure of HPMA copolymer-cholesterol nanoparticles is a pearl necklace structure, where ellipsoidal pearls mainly composed of cholesterol are covered by a HPMA shell; pearls are connected by bridges composed of hydrophilic HPMA copolymer chains. Using a combination of techniques, we unambiguously show that the Dox moieties are <b>not</b> <b>impregnated</b> inside a cholesterol core but are instead uniformly distributed across the whole nanoparticle, including the hydrophilic HPMA shell surface...|$|E

We observe different limit regimes: at low impact velocity, we recover the classical results for impregnation. The liquid does <b>not</b> <b>impregnate</b> the hydrophobic pore while it is totally sucked into the hydrophilic one. At high impact velocities, the drop is broken in two parts: one part spreads {{at the top of the}} surface while an isolated slug is trapped within the pore.

40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid method is {{described}} for the staining of neural end {{feet in the}} central nervous system.

Staining {{takes place in a}} silver gelatin reducer; the sections may be gold toned if necessary. By adding 2 % chromium fluoride to the chroming solution, it is possible to stain the mitochondria. By completely omitting the mordanting step, a general impregnation of neurofibrils is obtained.

Our main analy-sis compared the occurrence of CRBSI with rifampicin/minocycline-impregnated CVCs with that of non-rifampicin-impregnated CVCs. The PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched (until October 2006). Results: Eight RCTs were included in the analysis.

This paper compares the effects of two different processing methods of casting vs. pultrusion on the mechanical properties, fabric-matrix bond, and microstructural characteristics of fabric-cement composites. Bonded glass mesh fabrics, woven polyvinylalcohol (PVA), as well as warp knitted weft insertion polypropylene (PP) fabrics were used in this study. Tensile tests were conducted to study the mechanical performance of the composites. Pullout tests were carried out to examine the bond between the fabric and the cement matrix. A microstructural analysis was conducted and correlated with the mechanical performance of the composite and bonding. The advantages of using the pultrusion process for the production of fabric-cement composites were clearly indicated in this study. Improved mechanical performance was obtained for fabric-cement composites produced with the pultrusion process, especially with fabrics made from multifilament yarns (<b>not</b> <b>impregnated</b> in epoxy) having open junction points (not glued). This improved mechanical performance was explained due to improve bonding, obtained by the impregnation process of the fabric in the cement chamber during the pultrusion process, which helped fill the spaces between the filaments of the bundled yarns. 1...|$|E

Tensile, flexural and fabric-matrix bond tests were conducted to study the mechanical performance of the composites.

Improved mechanical performance was obtained for fabric-cement composites produced with the pultrusion process, especially with fabrics made from multifilament yarns (<b>not</b> <b>impregnated</b> in epoxy) having open junction points. This improved mechanical performance could be accounted for by the improved bonding, which was induced by the impregnation of the spaces between the filaments in the pultrusion process, and the lack of such effective impregnation is the casting process. However, in the epoxy impregnated fabric and the mono-filament fabric sufficient interfacial bonding could be obtained in the casting process and pultrusion did not yield a significant advantage...|$|E

2500|$|Freezing semen is a {{commonly}} used technique {{in the modern}} animal agriculture industry, which is well researched with established methods Semen is often collected using an artificial vagina, electroejaculation, gloved-hand technique, abdominal stroking, or epididymal sperm collection. Preferred collection techniques vary based on species and available tools. [...] Patience and technique are keys to successful collection of semen. There are several styles and types of artificial vaginas {{that can be used}} depending on the breed and species of the male. During this process the penis enters a tube that is the approximate pressure and temperature of the female's vagina. There is a disposable bag inside the tube that collects the semen. During this process it may be beneficial to have a teaser animal—an animal used to sexually tease but <b>not</b> <b>impregnate</b> the animal—to increase the arousal of the male. Electroejaculation is a method of semen collection in the cattle industry because it yields high quality semen. However, this process requires the animal to be trained and securely held, thus it is not ideal when working with wild or feral animals. When performing this process the electroejaculator is inserted into the rectum of the male. The electroejaculator stimulates the male causing an ejaculation, after which the semen is collected. The glove hand collection technique is used mainly in the swine industry. During this process, the boar mounts a dummy, while the handler grasps the penis of the boar between the ridges of his fingers and collects the semen. Abdominal stroking is exclusively used in the poultry industry. During the technique, one technician will hold the bird, while a second technician massages the bird's cloaca. However, feces and semen both exit the male bird's body through the cloaca, so the semen quality is often low.|$|R
