5|$|The main {{objection}} to this plan {{came from the}} independent traders who {{did not wish to}} relocate because they felt that the proposed new shopping area was 'off the beaten track'. This objection was <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable,</b> as in its pre-war topography Bristol had a long shopping axis that started at Stapleton Road to the east, passed through Old Market into Castle Street, Wine Street, and the City Markets, and then via The Centre and Park Street to Queens Road and Whiteladies Road. Moving the central shopping area would break this axis. There was also concern about the serious negative social and economic impacts of 'sterilising' such a large area in the centre of the city. However, when the Bristol Retail Traders Federation, representing the small traders, produced a poll showing that 13,000 people wished to retain the shopping centre on its current site whereas only 400 preferred to see it moved, the local Labour party dismissed the poll describing it as 'undemocratic' and comparing the Federation's methods to those of Hitler.|$|E

25|$|Laws {{regulating}} the discharge {{and treatment of}} sewage have led to dramatic nutrient reductions to surrounding ecosystems, but it is generally agreed that a policy regulating agricultural use of fertilizer and animal waste must be imposed. In Japan the amount of nitrogen produced by livestock is adequate to serve the fertilizer needs for the agriculture industry. Thus, it is <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> to command livestock owners to clean up animal waste—which when left stagnant will leach into ground water.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> {{but also}} not {{necessary}} to conclude that Marcellus was a practicing physician. In his dissertation, the intellectual historian of magic and medicine Lynn Thorndike pronounced him the “court physician” of Theodosius I, but the evidence is thin: Libanius, if referring to this Marcellus, praises his ability to cure a headache. The prevailing view is that Marcellus should be categorized as a medical writer and not a physician. A translator of the medical writings of Isidore of Seville characterizes Marcellus as a “medical amateur” and dismisses the De medicamentis as “nothing {{more than the usual}} ancient home remedies,” and the historian of botany Ernst Meyer seems to have considered him a dilettante.|$|E
25|$|In 1682 he was, at {{more than}} sixty years of age, {{recognized}} as one of the foremost men of letters of France. Madame de Sévigné, one of the soundest literary critics of the time, and by no means given to praise mere novelties, had spoken of his second collection of Fables published in the winter of 1678 as divine; and it is pretty certain that this was the general opinion. It was <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable,</b> therefore, that he should present himself to the Académie française, and, though the subjects of his Contes were scarcely calculated to propitiate that decorous assembly, while his attachment to Fouquet and to more than one representative of the old Frondeur party made him suspect to Colbert and the king, most of the members were his personal friends.|$|E
25|$|When {{the whole}} record is analyzed, gun-armed European troops met defeat on several {{occasion}} by charging spearmen or African infantry using poisoned arrows. In 1684 for example, the spearmen and bowmen of Changamire Dombo met the Portuguese in open combat at Mahungwe. Firearms inflicted heavy casualties on the African force, but the prolonged battle stretched {{into the darkness}} and night attacks forced a Portuguese withdrawal. In the 1690s Dombo's forces returned to achieve victory in a fast-moving campaign that expelled the Portuguese from all their settlements on the Zimbabwe plateau. This triumph effectively terminated the future presence of the Portuguese in the area, cutting them off from the gold mines. Overall, Portugal's foothold in the region was to remain tenuous {{for at least two}} centuries. These and other incidents illustrate both the power and limitations of firearms in African military systems. The later observations of Zulu King Chaka on the efficacy of firearms versus African alternatives were thus <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable.</b> It should be noted however that several of the Angolan kingdoms integrated a mix of gunmen with their indigenous fighting forces, adding to the diversity of arrangements for combat. This integration of new technology with existing systems is similar to the pike-musket-crossbow combinations seen when firearms were introduced to European battlefields.|$|E

25|$|Some paleontologists have {{doubted the}} biplane hypothesis, and have {{proposed}} other configurations. A 2010 study by Alexander et al. described {{the construction of}} a lightweight three-dimensional physical model used to perform glide tests. Using several hindleg configurations for the model, they found that the biplane model, while <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable,</b> was structurally deficient and needed a heavy-headed weight distribution for stable gliding, which they deemed unlikely. The study indicated that a laterally abducted hindwing structure represented the most biologically and aerodynamically consistent configuration for Microraptor. A further analysis by Brougham and Brusatte, however, concluded that Alexander's model reconstruction was not consistent with all of the available data on Microraptor and argued that the study was insufficient for determining a likely flight pattern for Microraptor. Brougham and Brusatte criticized the anatomy of the model used by Alexander and his team, noting that the hip anatomy was not consistent with other dromaeosaurs. In most dromaeosaurids, features of the hip bone prevent the legs from splaying horizontally; instead, they are locked in a vertical position below the body. Alexander's team used a specimen of Microraptor which was crushed flat to make their model, which Brougham and Brusatte argued did not reflect its actual anatomy. Later in 2010, Alexander's team responded to these criticisms, noting that the related dromaeosaur Hesperonychus, which is known from complete hip bones preserved in three dimensions, also shows hip sockets directed partially upward, possibly allowing the legs to splay more than in other dromaeosaurs.|$|E

500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy held officers need not personally advise passengers of their right to refuse consent to a search on a bus. Furthermore, Justice Kennedy ruled that the search was <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> because passengers were free to leave the bus and the individuals who were searched provided voluntary consent. Although some commentators have praised the Court's ruling for encouraging citizens [...] "to stand up for their rights", others have criticized it for failing to reflect the realities of [...] "real-life confrontations occurring on the street" [...] between citizens and law enforcement.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, Justice Kennedy {{held the}} {{searches}} were <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> because both Drayton and Brown voluntarily consented to the suspicionless search. He noted that police officers need not inform citizens {{of their right}} to refuse when conducting a search and that the Court has traditionally applied a [...] "totality of the circumstances" [...] test when determining whether a search is [...] "unreasonable". Because officers requested consent to search Drayton and Brown, Justice Kennedy concluded the search was consensual and voluntary. Justice Kennedy also mentioned in dicta that, absent consent, officers likely had reasonable suspicion to conduct a Terry stop. Consequently, Justice Kennedy ordered the case to be remanded to Eleventh Circuit for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision.|$|E
500|$|Robertson {{was finally}} breveted as a {{lieutenant}} colonel in June 1936. The rank became substantive in July 1937. Like other regular officers, Robertson {{was opposed to}} the [...] "Singapore strategy", and therefore to the defence policy {{of the government of}} the day, and said so publicly in the British Army Quarterly. Robertson argued for a local defence of Australia by land and air units. The naval theorist, Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond, responding to Robertson's arguments in an editorial, pointed out that local defence would fragment the British Empire's defence effort and could not secure the sea lanes. However, in view of the weakness of the Royal Navy, Richmond was forced to concede that Robertson's approach was <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable.</b>|$|E
500|$|Although the Fourth Amendment {{generally}} prohibits unreasonable {{searches and}} seizures, the Supreme Court of the United States has clarified that searches and seizures are <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> when citizens consent to them. Scholars have traced {{the origins of}} the Consent to Search Doctrine {{as far back as the}} 1920s, but it was not until the 1970s that the Court clarified that searches are reasonable if, under a [...] "totality of the circumstances", the search is [...] "voluntary". Courts generally look to whether officers believed, at the time of the search, the individual being searched provided voluntary consent. Officers may also rely on the consent of someone who reasonably appears to have authority to consent to a police search, even if that person actually has no such authority. However, if officers obtain consent after engaging in an unconstitutional seizure, the consent is considered [...] "tainted" [...] and evidence obtained from such a search cannot be admitted during a subsequent criminal prosecution.|$|E

500|$|While {{there is}} no set {{definition}} of what is or is <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable,</b> factors that {{are taken into account}} include any [...] "abnormal sensitivity" [...] of the claimant, the nature of the locality where the nuisance took place, the time and duration of the interference and the conduct of the defendant. [...] "Abnormal sensitivity" [...] is where the claimant's damaged property is particularly sensitive to damage by the defendant's actions. In Robinson v Kilvert, it was established that if the action of the defendant would not have caused damage were it not for this abnormal sensitivity, the defendant is not liable. However, if the damage was caused to abnormally sensitive property but would also have damaged non-sensitive property, the defendant is liable, as in McKinnon Industries v Walker. This was because it infringed on the [...] "right to ordinary enjoyment"; as a result, the claimant could claim for his more sensitive activities as well.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{regard the}} Zoo TV Tour {{as one of}} rock's most memorable tours.

In 1997, Robert Hilburn wrote that [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> {{to think of it}} as the Sgt. Pepper's of rock tours." [...] In 2002, Tom Doyle of Q called it [...] "still the most {{spectacular}} rock tour staged by any band", and in 2013, the magazine listed it as one of the [...] "ten greatest gigs of all time". In 2009, critic Greg Kot said, [...] "Zoo TV remains the finest supersized tour mounted by any band in the last two decades." [...] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork wrote in a review of Achtung Babys 20th anniversary reissue, [...] "Even 20 years on, the tour looks like something to behold, a singularly inventive experience that no band—including U2 itself—has been able to really expound upon in a meaningful way." [...] Rolling Stone included the tour on its 2017 list of [...] "The 50 Greatest Concerts of the Last 50 Years".|$|E
