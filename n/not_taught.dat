5|$|Although Braille was {{admired and}} {{respected}} by his pupils, his writing system was <b>not</b> <b>taught</b> at the Institute during his lifetime. The successors of Valentin Haüy, {{who had died}} in 1822, showed no interest in altering the established methods of the school, and indeed, they were actively hostile to its use. Dr. Alexandre François-René Pignier, headmaster at the school, was dismissed from his post after he had a history book translated into braille.|$|E
5|$|The {{complete}} {{history of}} Skåneland was <b>not</b> <b>taught</b> {{for a long}} time in schools in Skåneland, especially during periods with the immediate threat of revolt. Instead a Swedish-centric history was taught, and the Scanian history before 1658, for instance concerning the list of monarchs, was disregarded as a component of Danish history. In reaction, a movement began in the late 19th century to revive awareness of the history and culture of Skåneland. The renewed focus resulted in the publication of several books about Scanian history.|$|E
5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were <b>not</b> <b>taught</b> in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E

25|$|The ATA trained its pilots only {{to ferry}} planes, {{rather than to}} achieve {{perfection}} on every type.

25|$|Obviously, {{especially}} the typical use of ‘y’ and ‘gg’ leads to confusion, even among native speakers, since the dialect is <b>not</b> <b>taught</b> in schools. Aspirates are normally spelled as in Standard German, namely with ‘p’, ‘t’, ‘k’. However, words where the aspirates derive from a lenis consonant plus /h/ are usually written as lenis plus , e.g. bhalte 'to keep', gheie 'to fall'.|$|E
25|$|Most Protestants {{reject the}} {{doctrine}} {{because they do}} not consider the development of dogmatic theology to be authoritative apart from biblical exegesis, and because the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is <b>not</b> <b>taught</b> in the Bible. The formal pronouncement of Mary's Immaculate Conception by the Catholic Church in 1854 further alienated some Protestant churches largely due to its implication that not all have sinned.|$|E

25|$|Officers {{were trained}} at the School of Infantry. Freshly {{graduated}} Second Lieutenants had to first prove themselves in action before being given the responsibility of becoming a stick leader.

25|$|While {{anthroposophy}} underpins {{the curriculum}} design, pedagogical approach, and organizational structure, it is explicitly <b>not</b> <b>taught</b> {{within the school}} curriculum and {{studies have shown that}} Waldorf pupils have little awareness of it. Tensions may arise within the Waldorf community between the commitment to Steiner's original intentions, which has sometimes acted as a valuable anchor against following educational fads, and openness to new directions in education, such as the incorporation of new technologies or modern methods of accountability and assessment.|$|E
25|$|Debussy was {{experimental}} {{from the}} outset, favouring dissonances and intervals that were <b>not</b> <b>taught</b> at the Academy.

25|$|Based on very meager information, Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker {{suggests}} in The First Americans that Copernican astronomy, although <b>not</b> <b>taught</b> formally until later, {{started to}} emerge at Harvard College in 1670.

However, as early as 1659, one Harvard graduate, Zachariah Brigden, began to promote the new astronomy in the New England almanacs. Most astrological information came to the people by way of these almanacs.|$|E
25|$|From the Edo {{period to}} the Meiji period, several other arts were assimilated (fuzoku) into the various {{branches}} of Shintō Musō-ryū and {{were meant to}} be practiced alongside the main jō forms.
