40|$|Abstract — <b>Networked</b> <b>appliances</b> are {{consumer}} or household devices with {{a network}} interface which {{allows them to}} be connected to a (home) <b>network.</b> <b>Networked</b> <b>appliances</b> offer major benefits compared to their conventional equivalent. Software services can operate upon an array of these appliances to offer value added functionality. In this case the user interface to control the appliances will be inadequate. Commonly <b>networked</b> <b>appliances</b> may either be controlled using the traditional user interface, such as switches and buttons on the device, or alternatively using a PC based interface. Traditional user interfaces often cannot support the full functionality offered by the appliance. The PC based interfaces tend to be too complicated for the average user, nor will a PC based interface be suitable in many situations or indeed be available. Therefore a user interface which supports the new functionalities and is easy to use is required. In this paper, Anoto functionality enabled pen and paper are suggested as a suitable interface. Pen and paper are well known to all users and suitable paper forms make it straightforward to fully control and program <b>networked</b> <b>appliances</b> without a PC interface. Thus an important barrier to the acceptance of <b>networked</b> <b>appliances</b> is broken. Furthermore, the presented approach can be used to integrate the control of multiple appliances and services. A major challenge to this work has been the integration of different network protocols used in the home. The use of an OSGi gateway has proven a great help to integrate them. This paper discusses an approach to the integration of pen and paper with <b>networked</b> <b>appliances</b> using an OSGi gateway. Because of the use of an OSGi gateway, the approach is not restricted to controlling devices which use a specific single network protocol. Rather, the approach can be used with appliances which communicate using a wide variety of protocols. A. <b>Networked</b> <b>Appliances</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Feature {{interaction}} (FI) {{problems have}} long been a popular topic of investigation in Internet telephony environment. Due to recent proliferation of ubiquitous <b>networked</b> <b>appliances,</b> FI problems in <b>networked</b> <b>appliances</b> environment are becoming more apparent. FI problems create various conflicts which hinder system performance in term of efficiency. While most of the F! related research works are concentrating on <b>networked</b> <b>appliances</b> or Internet telephony environment, we propose a cache approach to detect FI problems and conflicts in both environments. This approach caches context information from context storage hence, offers more efficient and faster conflict detection in dynamic context environment.

In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and eval-uation of SONA system. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: User {{demands and}} {{technological}} advances are moving {{us closer to}} the pervasive computing vision. The home {{of the future will}} include <b>networked</b> <b>appliances</b> that publish the functions they offer as intelligent middleware services providing flexible, intuitive and zero-maintenance mechanisms for dynamic service composition, deployment, extensibility, management and usage. Whilst much work exists relating to service-oriented frameworks, this typically relies on attribute-based service matching and discovery, which is inherently restrictive since no universally agreed service description or taxonomy is available to describe services homogeneously. Device manufacturers inadvertently use different vocabularies to describe services and therefore ambiguities between terms are likely. In this paper we address these issues and describe our <b>Networked</b> <b>Appliance</b> Service Utilisation Framework (NASUF), which illustrates how services offered by <b>networked</b> <b>appliances</b> can be semantically composed to extend device capabilities and perform a plethora of data adaptation functions to automatically resolve any composition conflicts that may occur. We have developed a prototype to test NASUF and our findings show that the framework can dynamically compose services provided by <b>networked</b> <b>appliances</b> in Peer-to-Peer <b>networks...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Network</b> <b>appliances</b> {{are getting}} more popular and common both in the {{household}} and in industry. As more items become network aware, the variety of items also increases drastically. This leads to more heterogeneous systems with different vendors providing different implementations. As network appliances' functionality is expanded, people develop a greater dependence on them and hence their status and the ease of controlling them become of paramount importance. It is also beneficial for the <b>network</b> <b>appliances</b> {{to be able to}} integrate with a large existing network for easier access. TCP/IP is a protocol with a large user base and is also the protocol of choice for the Internet.

This makes TCP/IP a suitable protocol to link <b>network</b> <b>appliances</b> or at least to link them to the outside.

It is vital that the management protocol has sufficient security, as it might be disastrous for many <b>networked</b> <b>appliances</b> if exposed to unauthorized access such as alarms and temperature control. APSSNMP (Application Secure SNMP) as proposed, is a simpler implementation that is easier and less costly to implement.

40|$|Abstract. This paper formalizes {{three kinds}} of safety to be {{satisfied}} by <b>networked</b> <b>appliances</b> and services in the emerging home network system (HNS). The local safety is defined by safety instructions of individual <b>networked</b> <b>appliances.</b> The global safety is specified as required prop-erties of HNS services, which use multiple appliances simultaneously. The environment safety is derived from residential rules in home and surrounding environments. Based on the safety defined, we propose a modeling/validation framework for the safety. Specifically, we first intro-duce an object-oriented modeling technique to clarify the relationships among the appliances, the services and the home (environment) objects. We then employ the technique of Design by Contract with JML (Java Modeling Language), which achieves systematic safety validation through testing. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Networked</b> <b>appliances</b> {{are easy}} to use devices that are {{designed}} and built for a single function. This paper presents the design and implementation of a <b>networked</b> <b>appliance</b> for packet telephony. We examine the practical issues involved {{in the design and}} implementation of the appliance at all layers, including hardware architecture, system services, and the application. At each layer, we identify important challenges and describe the solutions that we implemented. Our packet telephony appliance is built around the Euphony network processor that integrates networking and DSP functions with a CPU. It uses a real-time operating system to provide predictable processing and networking support. In addition to describing the appliance, this paper presents two mechanisms which are of general use in the design of <b>networked</b> <b>appliances.</b> One mechanism is IObufs, which provides a unified buffering scheme that allows zero-copy data movement. Another is the Event Exchange (EVX), which provides a flexible mechanism for event distribution, allowing software modules to be composed together in an extensible manner. EVX and IObufs are used together to provide highly efficient intra-appliance communication. The combination of EVX and a general-purpose CPU provide a platform that can evolve gracefully to support new protocols, advanced telephony services, and enhanced user interfaces...|$|R
