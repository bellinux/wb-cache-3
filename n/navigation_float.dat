2500|$|After the {{explosion}} the boiler and engines were stripped from the wreck and transported to Dawson City; the boiler was {{installed on the}} sternwheeler Casca in 1907. The hull, deemed a menace to <b>navigation,</b> was <b>floated</b> downstream and abandoned in [...] "Columbia" [...] slough.|$|R
5000|$|A {{floating}} {{building is}} a building unit with a flotation system at its base, {{to allow it to}} float on water. It is common to define such a building as being [...] "permanently moored" [...] and not usable in <b>navigation.</b> [...] <b>Floating</b> buildings are usually towed into location by another ship and are unable to move under their own power.|$|R
5000|$|ColourMark is a <b>floating</b> <b>navigation</b> marker {{designed}} by Don Lang Design {{to fit on}} a steel or timber pile. The intent is to clearly mark the piles to prevent impact. [...] The first 12 ColourMarks were installed in Portsmouth Naval Harbour by the Ministry of Defence in 1997.|$|R
50|$|On February 2, 1950, the RSFSR Council of Ministers {{issued an}} order for the {{overhaul}} and reconstruction of the White Sea Canal's structures. Work began on the gradual electrification of the canal's structures and machinery. In 1953, the locks' staff started including electricians; by 1957, the electrification of the locks of the northern slope of the canal was completed, and by 1959 all coastal and <b>floating</b> <b>navigation</b> lights were switched to electric power.|$|R
40|$|Current <b>navigation</b> systems include <b>floating</b> car {{data and}} {{observed}} historic traffic flow patterns in their route optimization algorithms. Adding information on predicted severe weather events to the optimization process has benefits but {{raises the question}} how to communicate resulting route changes to the driver, given the inherent inaccuracy of weather predictions. In this contribution, we summarize the observed impact of different weather conditions on driving speed, propose alternative ways to communicate route changes due to predicted changes in weather conditions, and outline future research to assess how these communication alternatives are perceived by motorists...|$|R
500|$|The Rother Levels Acts {{were two}} Acts of Parliament which were {{obtained}} in 1826 and 1830. The Commissioners of the Rother Levels were obliged by the acts {{to ensure that}} <b>navigation</b> between Scots <b>Float</b> and Bodiam Bridge was possible, and that all bridges provided at least [...] of headroom. They also enshrined the principle {{that it was a}} free river, and no tolls were to be collected for its use. The Rennie brothers, John and George, who had taken over from their father on his death in 1821, produced two reports on the river in 1830, as it was difficult to navigate and prone to flooding. They were critical {{of the way in which}} tidal water was allowed to enter the river through Scots Float Sluice, and thought that the river channel was too circuitous, which resulted in shoals forming. The Rennie brothers also criticised the angles at which bridges crossed the channel. William Cubitt and James Elliott rebuilt Scots Float Sluice in 1844.|$|R
50|$|The Bangweulu swamps are fed {{mainly from}} the {{north-east}} by the Chambeshi River, and drain to the south into the Luapula River. The lake is connected to these rivers, and they to each other, by a complex mass of channels through the swamps that may become choked by vegetation and change their course; {{there is no easy}} <b>navigation</b> between them. <b>Floating</b> beds of papyrus may close up the channels to a width allowing only dugout canoes to pass. Motorised vessels are hampered by their width as well as by vegetation clogging propellers. Since colonial times {{attempts have been made to}} improve navigation and alter drainage patterns by cutting channels through the swamp. In 1942, attempts were made, with limited success, to cut an outlet from Lake Walilupe to the Luapula's exit from the swamps, to allow motor boats to transport cassava and other produce from the northern area of the lake to Kapalala Ferry on the Luapula and from there to the Copperbelt.|$|R
50|$|The salties Prins Willem V and Monrovia also sank in the Great Lakes {{during the}} 1950s; both in {{collisions}} with other ships. The saltie Francisco Morazan {{was a total}} loss after running aground off South Manitou Island on November 29, 1960. Another saltie Nordmeer grounded on Thunder Bay Island Shoal in November 1966 but {{before it could be}} refloated was further damaged in the same storm that sank the Morrell and it was declared a total loss.Ships on the Lakes have been involved in many lesser incidents. Lakers have been subject to frequent groundings in port and channels due to varying lake levels and silting, collisions with objects (such as the 1993 collision of the Indiana Harbor with the Lansing Shoals Light Station), icing in during winter trips and shipboard fires (including the unusual case in 2001 where a drawbridge ran into the Canadian grain carrier Windoc causing a fire). To prevent collisions and groundings, the Great Lakes are well-served with lighthouses and lights, and <b>floating</b> <b>navigation</b> aids. The U.S. Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard maintain stations around the Great Lakes including icebreakers and rescue helicopters. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies maintain the harbors and seaways to limit groundings by dredging and seawalling.|$|R
