40|$|ABSTRACT: Cure-dependent {{mechanical}} properties {{are used in}} finite element-based models to determine process-induced residual stresses and deformations in composite parts.

The solution for the displacements is expressed as an amplitude distribution and is presented in polar diagrams. This analysis has potential usefulness in the acoustic emission (AE) and ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation of composite materials.

40|$|The {{values of}} phase {{velocities}} of ultrasonic waves in transversely isotropic media {{are presented in}} terms of the fiber volume fraction of a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fiberglass</b> epoxy composite with constant matrix properties and the ratio between extensional moduli in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the composite when the properties of the fibers are changed, at a constant fiber volume fraction. The model of a homogeneous transversely isotropic medium is adopted to describe the relations between elastic properties and velocities. The displacements due to an oscillatory point source in an infinite medium are used as one measure of comparison of the behavior of the unidirectional composite according to the variations of the parameters, as described above. Values of phase velocities, elastic moduli, Poisson's ratios and displacements due to a point source can be read from the parameterized plots for a known fiber volume fraction or a known ratio between extensional moduli of the composite. Alternatively fiber volume fraction and the ratio between extensional moduli can be inferred from the plots when the values of the phase velocities are known; for example from experimental measurements.

Acousto-ultrasonic noncontact input-output characterization is studied theoretically with a transmitting and a receiving transducer {{located on the}} same face of the plate. The single reflection problem for an incident SV wave at a plane boundary in transversely isotropic medium is analyzed. An obliquely incident SV wave results in a reflected SV wave and a reflected P wave for an angle of incidence of the incident SV wave less than the critical angle. Otherwise, there exists only an SV wave in the medium as the reflected P wave degenerates into a surface wave travelling parallel to the plane boundary. The amplitude ratio of the reflected SV wave is - 1 when the angle of incidence is greater than or = the critical angle. The directional dependence of the phase velocity of the SV wave propagating in the transversely isotropic medium has {{a significant effect on}} the delay time, as opposed to the directional independence of the phase velocity of a shear wave propagating in an isotropic medium.

40|$|It is {{desirable}} to obtain materials that have high vibration damping while maintaining other structural properties. Aerospace quality composite materials typically have greater strength and stiffness to weight ratios than most metals, while providing increased damping. However, their passive damping capacities {{are not enough}} for some applications.

For a given type of fiberglass, the lower durometer elastomer produced the highest loss factor. For a given elastomer stiffness, the stiffest reinforcement produced the highest damping.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate microwave and electron beam technologies as alternate energy sources to consolidate fiber coated with a thermoplastic binding agent into preforms for composite molding applications. Bench experiments showed that both microwave and electron beam energy can produce heat sufficient to melt and consolidate a thermoplastic binding agent applied to <b>fiberglass</b> <b>mat,</b> and several two- and three-dimensional fiberglass preforms were produced with each method. In both cases, it is postulated that the heating was accomplished by the effective interaction of the microwave or electron beam energy with the combination of the mat preform and the tooling used to shape the preform. Both methods contrast with conventional thermal energy applied via infrared heaters or from a heated tool in which the heat to melt the thermoplastic binding agent must diffuse over time from the outer surface of the preform toward its center under a thermal gradient. For these reasons, the microwave and electron beam energy techniques have the potential to rapidly consolidate thick fiber preforms more efficiently than the thermal process. With further development, both technologies have the potential to make preform production more cost effective by decreasing cycle time in the preform tool, reducing energy costs, and by enabling the use of less expensive tooling materials. Descriptions of the microwave and electron beam consolidation experiments and a summary of the results are presented in this report...|$|R

Limited thermal conductivity and variability data is available for composites made from carbon fibres that are widely used in mould and aircraft construction. A summary of experimental measurements and directional thermal conductivity models for carbon/epoxy composite materials is presented. Experimental data were collected for AS 4 fibre unidirectional tape prepreg and T 300 fibre <b>unidirectional</b> <b>non-woven</b> and plain weave textile reinforced composites.

40|$|Because of {{the stress}} {{response}} of pigs during restraint, time spend on blood sampling should be as short as possible. A realistic swine model which allowed students to practice methods such as blood sampling {{during the course of}} their clinical training, before collecting blood from live pigs, was therefore developed. The idea for this model originated from the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna and was realized as a co-operational project with the Skills Laboratory of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover. The first step was the production of a pig torso using a frozen pig as a basis, which was molded by plaster binds. In a second step this gypsum model was lined with <b>fiberglass</b> <b>mats.</b> This prototype was used to form a further model without the aperture of the thorax. To close this thoracic gap a life-size silicone insert was constructed. This resembled the anatomy of the pig, and consisted of a trachea, veins and arteries made of caoutchouc (natural rubber that has not been vulcanized) tubes. These tubes were filled with colored fluid to simulate successful blood sampling. In addition, the pig model could also be used to further teach procedures in the skills laboratory, such as intramuscular injection in a silicone pad in the neck behind the ear and nose swab sampling of the nasal passages. This newly developed pig model could improve student´s clinical training in swine in the skills lab of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna.

40|$|As {{part of the}} U. S. Department of Energy's Low Wind Speed Turbine program, Global Energy Concepts LLC (GEC) 1 {{has studied}} {{alternative}} composite materials for wind turbine blades in the multi-megawatt size range. This work {{in one of the}} Blade System Design Studies (BSDS) funded through Sandia National Laboratories. The BSDS program was conducted in two phases. In the Part I BSDS, GEC assessed candidate innovations in composite materials, manufacturing processes, and structural configurations. GEC also made recommendations for testing composite coupons, details, assemblies, and blade substructures to be carried out in the Part II study (BSDS-II). The BSDS-II contract period began in May 2003, and testing was initiated in June 2004. The current report summarizes the results from the BSDS-II test program. Composite materials evaluated include carbon fiber in both pre-impregnated and vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) forms. Initial thin-coupon static testing included a wide range of parameters, including variation in manufacturer, fiber tow size, fabric architecture, and resin type. A smaller set of these materials and process types was also evaluated in thin-coupon fatigue testing, and in ply-drop and ply-transition panels. The majority of materials used epoxy resin, with vinyl ester (VE) resin also used for selected cases. Late in the project, testing of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fiberglass</b> was added to provide an updated baseline against which to evaluate the carbon material performance. Numerous unidirectional carbon fabrics were considered for evaluation with VARTM infusion. All but one fabric style considered suffered either from poor infusibility or waviness of fibers combined with poor compaction. The exception was a triaxial carbon-fiberglass fabric produced by SAERTEX. This fabric became the primary choice for infused articles throughout the test program. The generally positive results obtained in this program for the SAERTEX material have led to its being used in innovative prototype blades of 9 -m and 30 -m length, as well as other non-wind related structures...|$|R

40|$|The {{vibration}} of {{a helicopter}} has several different sources, such as the rotor, engine and transmission system. This creates {{a number of problems}} with performance, for example poor manoeuvrability, discomfort of the pilot, low fatigue life of the structural components, and, consequently, high operating costs. At the present time there are in existence various methodologies for vibration reduction, such as Higher Harmonic Control (HHC), Individual Blade Control (IBC), Active Control of Structural Response (ACSR), Active Twist Blade (ATB), and Active Trailing-edge Flap (ATF). The goal of the presented work is the development of an active twist actuation concept based on the application of Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) actuators. These actuators consist of polyamide films with IDE-electrodes. They are glued on the top and the bottom of piezoceramic ribbons and oriented at ± 450 to the spar axis of the rotor blade. The interdigitated electrodes deliver the electric field required to activate the piezoelectric effect in the fibers and this, in turn, creates a stronger longitudinal piezoelectric effect {{along the length of the}} fibers. The properties and orientation of piezoelectric actuators cause the MFC actuators to induce shear stresses and thus distribute a twisting movement along the blade. The design methodology, based on the planning of experiments and response surface technique, has been developed for an optimum placement of Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) actuators in helicopter rotor blades. The optimisation problem for the optimum placement of actuators in helicopter rotor blades has been formulated on the results of parametric study. The investigated helicopter has a rotor blade which is equipped with NACA 23012 airfoil and has a rectangular shape with an active part radius of 1. 56 m and a chord length of 0. 121 m. The blade also consists of D-spar. This is made of <b>unidirectional</b> <b>fiberglass,</b> reinforced plastic (UD GFRP), a skin made of ± 450 GFRP, a foam core, balancing weight and MFC actuators placed on the top and bottom of the skin.

The rotor blade skins are modelled with linear layered structural shell elements (SHELL 99), balancing weights and foam with 3 D 20 -node structural solid elements (SOLID 186).
