25|$|Although {{patients}} {{at high risk}} of bleeding were excluded from the phase III clinical study (PROWESS), 25% of patients treated with drotrecogin and 18% of those receiving placebo experienced at least one bleeding event (principally ecchymoses or GI bleeding) during the 28-day study period. During treatment serious bleeding events (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, any life-threatening bleeding event, any bleeding event requiring administration of at least 3 units of packed red blood cells daily for 2 consecutive days) occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with drotrecogin and in 1% of those receiving placebo. <b>No</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> geriatric patients and younger patients regarding bleeding events in the drotrecogin group have been found.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{academic}} achievement and social adjustment of mentally retarded students who have had five years of special education with mentally retarded students who have had no special education. This comparison was made to determine if there is a <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two groups. The present study was not undertaken to defend or attack special education classes. The study was designed to determine to what extent academic and social <b>differences</b> existed <b>between</b> the two groups. It is hoped the results of this study can be used in planning programs for the educable mentally retarded children in the Weber County Schools. The writer proposes the following hypotheses: 1. There will be <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two groups in reading. 2. There will be <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two groups in arithmetic. 3.

25|$|Although Linus Pauling {{is known}} for highly respectable {{research}} in chemistry and biochemistry, he is also known for promoting the consumption of vitamin C in large doses. Pauling wrote multiple books endorsing vitamin C megadosing. Although he claimed and stood firm in his claim that consuming over 1,000mg is helpful for one’s immune system when fighting a head cold, the results of empirical research do not align with this view. Researchers Vitetta, Sali, Paspaliaris, and Reavley (2002) completed a double blind randomized control study with 400 healthy participants. Throughout the 18 month experiment, there were 189 reported cases of head colds. Researchers {{found that there were}} <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> the medication groups, and taking 1,000mg of vitamin C at the first signs of a head cold did not help (Vitetta et al., 2002). There are also some minor yet unwanted ailments associated with vitamin C megadosing. These ailments were first noted in 1981 by Dr. Fong, who said that large doses of vitamin C can cause diarrhea and urethritis for limited amounts of time (Fong, 1981).|$|E

2500|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{that was}} performed indicates research {{studies conducted in}} PGD underscore future research. This is due to positive attitudinal survey results, postpartum follow-up studies demonstrating <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> those who had used PGD and those who conceived naturally, and ethnographic studies which confirmed that those with a previous history of negative experiences found PGD as a relief. Firstly, in the attitudinal survey, women {{with a history of}} infertility, pregnancy termination, and repeated miscarriages reported having a more positive attitude towards preimplantation genetic diagnosis. They were more accepting towards pursuing PGD. Secondly, likewise to the first attitudinal study, an ethnographic study conducted in 2004 found similar results. Couples with a history of multiple miscarriages, infertility, and an ill child, felt that preimplantation genetic diagnosis was a viable option. They also felt more relief; [...] "those using the technology were actually motivated to not repeat pregnancy loss". In summary, although some of these studies are limited due to their retrospective nature and limited samples, the study's results indicate an overall satisfaction of participants for the use of PGD. However, the authors of the studies do indicate that these studies emphasize the need for future research such as creating a prospective design with a valid psychological scale necessary to assess the levels of stress and mood during embryonic transfer and implantation.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{research}} {{does not}} support significant links between meat consumption and various cancers. Key et al. found that [...] "There were <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> vegetarians and nonvegetarians in mortality from cerebrovascular disease, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer or all other causes combined." [...] Truswell reviewed numerous studies, concluding that the relationship of colorectal cancer with meat consumption appeared weaker than the [...] "probable" [...] status it had been given by the World Cancer Research Foundation in 1997. A study by Chao et al. (2005) found an apparent association of colorectal cancer with red meat consumption after adjustment for age and energy intake. However, after further adjustment for body mass index, cigarette smoking and other covariates, no association with red meat consumption was found. Alex' ander conducted a meta-analysis which found no association of colorectal cancer with consumption of animal fat or protein. Based on European data (EPIC-Oxford study), Key et al. found that incidence of colorectal cancer was somewhat lower among meat eaters than among vegetarians. However, they concluded that 'the study is not large enough to exclude small or moderate differences for specific causes of death, and more research on this topic is required'. A study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) found that association between esophageal cancer risk and total and processed meat intake was not statistically significant. Another recent study of [...] EPIC [...] found a significant correlation between eating ' processed meat and cardiovascular diseases...also to cancer. In this population, reduction of processed meat consumption to less than 20g/day would prevent more than 3% of all deaths.' ...|$|E
