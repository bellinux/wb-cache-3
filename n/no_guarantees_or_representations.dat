Weighted prediction error (WPE) method performs {{well on the}} dereverberation but with limitations. First, WPE doesn't consider {{the influence of the}} additive noise which degrades the performance of dereverberation. Second, it relies on a time-consuming iterative process, and there is <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>or</b> a widely accepted criterion on its convergence. In this paper, we integrate deep neural network (DNN) into WPE for dereverberation and denoising. DNN is used to suppress the background noise to meet the noise-free assumption of WPE. Meanwhile, DNN is applied to directly predict spectral variance of the target speech to make the WPE work without iteration. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a significant improvement in speech quality and runs fast...|$|R

5000|$|The {{final cost}} of the project is {{uncertain}} when construction begins because design is not complete. [...] With the traditional design-bid-build process, {{a complete set of}} construction documents and specifications describes what the builder agrees to build and serves as the heart of the contract. On Fast-Track projects, the design, construction documents and specifications are incomplete, so setting the final cost presents problems. To deal with this difficultly, owners typically use a cost-reimbursable contract with the builder (a construction manager or a general contractor). The contract may include a cost estimate with <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>or</b> there may be a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). However, even with a GMP, there can be argument over the scope of work covered by the GMP since the design was incomplete when the contract was executed.|$|R
