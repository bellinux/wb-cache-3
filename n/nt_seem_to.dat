40|$|The aim of {{this trial}} {{was to assess the}} {{clinical}} efficacy of neural therapy (NT) when treating canine atopic dermatitis. Eighteen dogs (no control group), with at least a 12 -month history of having nonseasonal atopic dermatitis, were included. No medication with either glucocorticoids or cyclosporin was allowed during the trial. One set of NT was given by injecting an intravenous dose of 0. 1 mg/kg of a 0. 7 % procaine solution, followed by 10 to 25 intradermal injections of the same solution in a volume of 0. 1 – 0. 3 mL per site. Dogs were given 6 – 13 sets of NT during the therapy. The dermatological condition of each patient was evaluated before and after the treatment using two scales: the pruritus visual analogue scale (PVAS) and the canine atopic dermatitis extent and severity index (CADESI). The reduction of pruritus was statistically significant using a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test (P < 0. 001). No adverse side effects were observed. <b>NT</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be an effective alternative to control signs related to canine atopic dermatitis...|$|R

In singleton and dichorionic twin pregnancies, increased NT thickness is associated with trisomy 21 and other aneuploidies, major fetal anomalies (especially congenital heart disease), and genetic syndromes. The pathophysiology and significance of increased or discordant NT in monochorionic twin pregnancies is more complex and is associated with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and other pregnancy complications due to monochorionicity. The long-term neurological outcome of euploid children without structural anomalies after increased fetal <b>NT</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be favorable. Proper counseling is essential in the screening process. Special attention should be paid to the assessment of NT screening quality control. Even in the era of arising possibilities for non-invasive fetal karyotype determination from maternal blood, the role of NT screening is far from over. The association of this phenomenon with aneuploidies is only one of its utilities in modern obstetrics.

40|$|Microbes play crucial {{roles in}} geochemical cy-cling and {{ecosystem}} functioning. Microbial bio-mass, metabolism, and enzymes are often measured to provide immediate information about {{small changes in}} soils (Hu et al. 2011). It is commonly known that carbon (C) is a key factor governing soil microorganism growth (Grayston et al. 1998). Testing invertase activity could monitor soil’s long-term productivity (Bogdevitch and Mikhailouskaya 2009), while soil respiration is valuable for under-standing total microbial activities (Fernandes et al. 2005), and microbial metabolic quotient is an indicator of ecosystem disturbance and develop-ment (Wardle and Ghani 1995). No tillage (<b>NT)</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be superior to conven-tional tillage (CT) for conserving soil and water, and for increasing C deposits into soil (Alvear et al. 2005). Reduction in physical disturbance may slow organic matter decomposition and thereby contribute to longevity of microbes (Yang et al. 2012 b). Nevertheless, long-term NT may also result in surface soil hardening and a more limited O 2 supply for microbes (Álvaro-Fuentes et al. 2008). In that case, long-term field experiments are urgent to improve our knowledge of changes in microbial parameters with various tillage practices, and investigating their seasonal dynamics may help to ensure an opportunity for popularizing NT.

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{relationships}} between nephrostomy tube (NT) size and outcome of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). The Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society (CROES) prospectively collected data from consecutive patients treated with PCNL over a 1 -year period at 96 participating centers worldwide. This report focuses on the 3, 968 patients who received a NT of known size. Preoperative, surgical procedure and outcome data were analyzed according to NT size, dividing patients into two groups, namely small-bore (SB; nephrostomy size ≤ 18 Fr) and large-bore (LB; nephrostomy size > 18 Fr) NT. Patients who received a LB NT had a significantly lower rate of hemoglobin reduction (3. 0 vs. 4. 3 g/dL; P < 0. 001), overall complications (15. 8 vs. 21. 4 %; P < 0. 001) and a trend toward a lower rate of fever (9. 1 vs. 10. 7 %). Patients receiving a LB NT conversely had a statistically, though not clinically significant, longer postoperative hospital stay (4. 4 vs. 4. 2 days; P = 0. 027). There were no differences in urinary leakage (0. 9 vs. 1. 3 %, P = 0. 215) or stone-free rates (79. 5 vs. 78. 1 %, P = 0. 281) between the two groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lack of {{electroencephalography}} (EEG) background reactivity during therapeutic hypothermia (TH) {{has been}} associated with poor outcome in post-anoxic comatose patients. However, decision on intensive care withdrawal is based on normothermic (NT) evaluations. This study aims at exploring whether patients showing recovery of EEG reactivity in NT after a non-reactive EEG in TH differ from those remaining non-reactive. METHODS: Patients with non-reactive EEG during TH were identified from our prospective registry of consecutive comatose adults admitted after successful resuscitation from CA between April 2009 and June 2014. Variables including neurological examination, serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE), procalcitonin, and EEG features were compared regarding impact on functional outcome at 3 months. RESULTS: Seventy-two of 197 patients (37 %) had a non-reactive EEG background during TH with thirteen (18 %) evolving towards reactivity in NT. Compared to those remaining non-reactive (n = 59), they showed significantly better recovery of brainstem reflexes (p < 0. 001), better motor responses (p < 0. 001), transitory consciousness improvement (p = 0. 008), and a tendency toward lower NSE (p = 0. 067). One patient recovering EEG reactivity survived with good functional outcome at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery of EEG reactivity from TH <b>to</b> <b>NT</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> distinguish two patients' subgroups regarding early neurological assessment and transitory consciousness improvement, corroborating the role of EEG in providing information about cerebral functions. Understanding these dynamic changes encourages maintenance of intensive support in selected patients even after a non-reactive EEG background in TH, as a small subgroup may indeed recover with good functional outcome...|$|R
40|$|Glucose oxidase (GOx) {{has been}} immobilized on multiwall and {{herringbone}} carbon nanotubes (NTs) for glucose biosensing. Emphasis has been {{pointed in the}} effect of the structure and surface chemistry in the biosensor performance. Functionalization with carboxylic moieties renders a better performance than amino groups, and it also improves the performance with respect to that of bare NTs. No relationship was found between sensitivity to glucose and the amount of charge coming from the direct electron transfer between NTs and the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) group of GOx. Based on these results, oxidized herringbones and multiwall NTs were used to prepare electrochemical sensors with different GOx loadings that were tested at positive and negative potentials. At positive potentials, the sensing mechanism is based on the oxidation of H 2 O 2, and differences in sensitivity are related to the amount of active enzyme loaded on the carbon nanotubes surface. This amount <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be enhanced by the presence of carboxylic moieties on oxidized NTs, {{as well as by the}} homogeneous surface structure and higher surface area of multiwall NTs. In this sense, the homogeneous structure of multiwall <b>NTs</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be more important than their larger surface area. At negative potentials, the detection mechanism is driven by oxygen consumption during the glucose oxidation. Thanks to the aforementioned reasons, multiwall NTs provide a similar sensibility and working range as herringbone NTs while using half the amount of GOx. These results point out the huge impact of NTs structure and surface chemistry upon the activity of GOx for electrochemical sensors.

40|$|Metalloproteases are a {{class of}} {{proteins}} very important for bacterial physiology, {{they are involved in}} many different aspects of microbial life and in the recent years they are target of many relevant studies. Through a genomic approach, we identified three hypothetical metalloprotease in Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) : NT 013, NT 017 and NT 022. These proteins belong to LytM family, which is composed by factors mainly involved in cell division and in pathogenesis. The analysis of knockout mutant strains phenotypes confirms the role of protein NT 013 and NT 022 in cell splitting process; in particular we observed defective phenotypes in terms of cell morphology, formation of chains and bacterial aggregates. Moreover, we demonstrated a direct activity of protein NT 013 in peptidoglycan cleavage, meanwhile <b>NT</b> 022 <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have a regulatory function. Furthermore, the alteration in the cell division in the KO strains resulted in an increase in the release of Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs), probably due to a decrease in membrane stability. NT 017 does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be involved in cell division process, but has a possible role in host colonization, since NT 017 deletion reduces the capacity of NTHi to adhere to epithelial cells, to form biofilm and shows a susceptibility to human serum mediated killing.

40|$|Total lack {{of visual}} {{experience}} [dark rearing (DR) ] {{is known to}} prolong the critical period and delay development of sensory functions in mammalian visual cortex. Recent results show that neurotrophins (NTs) counteract the effects of DR on functional properties of visual cortical cells and exert a strong control on critical period duration. NTs are known to modulate the development and synaptic efficacy of neurotransmitter systems that are affected by DR. However, it is still unknown whether the actions of NTs in dark-reared animals involve interaction with neurotransmitter systems. We have studied the effects of DR on the expression of key molecules in the glutamatergic and GABAergic systems in control and NT-treated animals. We have found that DR reduced {{the expression of the}} NMDA receptor 2 A subunit and its associated protein PSD- 95 (postsynaptic density- 95), of GRIP (AMPA glutamate receptor interacting protein), and of the biosynthetic enzyme GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase). Returning dark-reared animals to light for 2 hr restored normal expression of the above-mentioned proteins almost completely. NT treatment specifically counteracts DR effects; NGF acts primarily on the NMDA system, whereas BDNF acts primarily on the GABAergic system. Finally, the action of <b>NT</b> 4 <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> involve both excitatory and inhibitory systems.

40|$|The {{expression}} of ENTPD 1 (ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase) along the glomerular microvasculature of the kidney is downregulated in ischemic conditions, {{in contrast to}} E 5 NT (ecto- 5 '-nucleotidase), which may explain the increased tendency for intraglomerular microthrombus formation in vivo. It {{has been suggested that}} in ischemia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) affect glomerular ENTPD 1, whereas E 5 <b>NT</b> <b>seems</b> less sensitive <b>to</b> oxidant stress. To test this hypothesis, a soluble ATP and ADP hydrolyzing enzyme solution (apyrase) [0. 4 U/ml] or 5 '-nucleotidase solution [0. 33 U/ml] as well renal tissue were exposed to ROS, generated by gamma-irradiation in vitro. The enzymes diluted in distilled water or cryostat rat kidney sections were exposed to gamma-irradiation (0. 037 Gy/s) for 0, 2, 5, 10, or 15 min, with or without supplementation of the ROS scavenger dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The enzyme activity of the samples was biochemically tested using standard methods, before and after irradiation. The reaction product of irradiated versus nonirradiated kidney sections was semiquantitatively evaluated after histochemical staining for either glomerular ENTPD 1 or glomerular E 5 NT expression. The results show that the enzyme activity in samples of soluble apyrase was significantly decreased after irradiation. This effect was inhibited by DMSO. In contrast, 5 '-nucleotidase activity showed only a limited decline of the activity curve after irradiation, which could also be restored following supplementation of DMSO. Glomerular ENTPD 1 expression showed significant decrease after irradiation of kidney sections; again, this was inhibitable by DMSO. Glomerular E 5 NT activity was not altered by irradiation and DMSO supplementation did not affect its activity. It is concluded that soluble apyrase as well as the glomerular ENTPD 1 are sensitive to oxidant stress, which may explain their down-regulation in the ischemic condition in vivo. However, soluble 5 '-nucleotidase and E 5 <b>NT</b> <b>seem</b> much less sensitive to ROS. This relative insensitivity of E 5 NT to oxidant injury may counteract ischemic injury by promoting local generation of adenosine in the ischemic micro-environment. Copyright (C) 2008 S.

Hence, eleven table tennis players (19 ± 1 years) performed graded exercise tests on cycle ergometer, arm cranking ergometer, treadmill and specific table tennis test. Te respiratory response and lactatemia were measured during the tests. We did not find significant differences among RCP, AnTLAC and OBLA 3, 5 in arm cranking ergometer (63. 4 ± 4. 8 W, 66. 9 ± 4. 5 W and 64. 5 ± 6. 1 W, respectively), treadmill (11. 4 ± 0. 4 km. h- 1, 11. 3 ± 0. 3 km. h- 1 and 11. 1 ± 0. 3 km. h- 1, respectively), and specific table tennis test (40. 5 ± 1. 8 bolas. min- 1, 42. 6 ± 3. 6 bolas. min- 1 and 42. 8 ± 5. 6 bolas. min- 1, respectively). However, the OBLA 3, 5 (131. 9 ± 6. 6 W) was significantly lower than RCP (149. 3 ± 4. 9 W) and AnTLAC (149. 3 ± 4. 7 W) in the cycle ergometer. Strong and significant correlation coefficients were found in the specific test for all methods (r range 0. 83 to 0. 95), in arm cranking ergometer between RCP and OBLA 3, 5 (r= 0. 78), and on treadmill running between OBLA 3, 5 a n d A n T LAC (r= 0. 76).

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the infrared behavior of electric and magnetic gluon propagators in Landau gauge {{is affected by}} temperature. More precisely, we perform large-lattice simulations in pure SU(2) gauge theory around the transition temperature Tc and study the longitudinal (electric) and transverse (magnetic) gluon propagators in momentum space, proposing the calculation of screening masses through an Ansatz from the zero-temperature case. Going from zero to nonzero temperature, {{we see that the}} longitudinal gluon propagator DL(p) is enhanced, with an apparent plateau value in the infrared, while the transverse propagator DT(p) gets progressively more infrared-suppressed, with a clear turnover in momentum at all nonzero temperatures considered. Our data allow us to associate what was previously seen as a peak in the infrared value of DL(p) at Tc to severe finite-size effects along the temperature direction. In particular, a temporal lattice extent <b>Nt</b> >= 8 <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be needed to study the electric sector around the transition. Once these systematic errors are eliminated, the infrared behavior of the longitudinal propagator appears to be rather independent of the temperature below the transition. Above Tc, the infrared value of DL(p) starts to decrease monotonically with the temperature.

40|$|Detection {{of changes}} in the flow rate of {{expelled}} fluids in accretionary prisms by monitoring of electric and magnetic fields is discussed. A numerical model of the electric and magnetic fields associated with fluid flow variations at the Nankai Trough is presented which gives a numerical solution of the coupled system of electric convection currents and conduction currents that directly determines the magnetic anomaly itself. Measurements in a borehole located between two vents are shown to be well adapted to detection of fluid flow variations using the vertical gradient of the electric potential and the horizontal magnetic field. The vertical electric field is about 10 mV/km up to 500 m depth where there is a lithologic reflector and about 50 mV/km below this reflector. The horizontal gradient of the magnetic field is 2 nT/km at the seafloor. Modelization with a lower fault conductivity and a larger décollement thickness has also been modeled. The vertical gradient of the horizontal magnetic field is ~ 5 to 15 nT/km. A variation of 3 mV and 1. 5 to 3 nT at 600 m depth in a borehole could reveal a fluid flow rate variation of 20 %, which is a reasonable fluid flow change based on some observations at short-scale time. Since a 1. 5 <b>to</b> 3 <b>nT</b> anomaly <b>seems</b> easier <b>to</b> detect than a 3 mV anomaly, {{it is likely that the}} variation of the magnetic field would more sensitively reveal fluid flow variations.

40|$|We perform lattice {{simulations}} in pure-SU(2) Yang-Mills {{theory to}} investigate how the infrared behavior of electric and magnetic gluon propagators in Landau gauge {{is affected by}} temperature. We consider the largest lattices to date, {{in an attempt to}} keep systematic errors under control. Electric and magnetic screening masses are calculated through an Ansatz from the zero-temperature case, based on complex-conjugate poles for the momentum-space propagators. As recently reported in [1], we find good fits to the proposed form at all temperatures considered, with different ratios of real to imaginary part of the pole masses for the longitudinal (electric) and transverse (magnetic) propagators. The behavior of the magnetic propagator D_T(p) is in agreement with the dimensional-reduction picture, showing infrared suppression (with a turnover in momentum) and violation of spectral positivity at all nonzero temperatures considered. The longitudinal propagator D_L(p) appears to reach a plateau at small momenta and is subject to severe finite-Nt effects around the critical temperature Tc. As a consequence, only lattices with temporal extent <b>Nt</b> > 8 <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be free from systematic errors. After these errors are removed, the infrared-plateau value is considerably reduced around the transition and the sharp peak observed previously for this quantity at Tc is no longer present. The resulting infrared behavior for D_L(p) at Tc is essentially the same as for 0. 5 Tc. An investigation of the temperature range between 0. 5 Tc and Tc reveals that a less pronounced (finite) peak may occur at smaller temperatures, e. g. T ~ 0. 9 Tc.
