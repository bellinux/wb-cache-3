And the gain factor k affects the bandwidth of the closed-loop system which will be analyzed in detail in the following. Commonly, the resonance frequency ω is set on the system <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> ω [...] <b>n</b> [...]. From {{the perspective}} of time-domain, the proposed instantaneous power calculation actually utilize the information of 1 / 4 fundamental cycles of voltage and current, and can give out a refreshed result every 1 AD interruption cycle. However, as the proposed SOGI structure is frequency dependent, problems can occur when system frequency fluctuating under different conditions. Thanks to the VSG module can generate the continuously and slowly-varied intrinsic frequency, it can be employed easily without the fear of frequency skipping or phase jumping event. Here, the resonance frequency ω can be replaced with the intrinsic frequency of VSG, and this embedded value assures the accuracy of center frequency without need of any PLL, thus improves the performance of instantaneous power calculation with SOGI method.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{tolerance}} synthesis, which involves {{the allocation of}} the specified assembly tolerances among the component dimensions of an assembly to ensure a specified yield. Even though the issue of tolerance synthesis has been discussed widely, most research often assumes that component alternatives have equal <b>nominal</b> <b>values.</b> Therefore, the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> are negligible. However, there may be situations where the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> are different. In such cases, the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> should be considered.

50|$|In 1924, coins {{were put}} into {{circulation}} in {{the territory of the}} Soviet Union. These were in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 2, 3 and 5 kopecks in copper; 10, 15, 20 kopecks in base-alloy silver; and 50 kopecks and 1 ruble in silver. Copper coins of the smallest <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> of half kopeck were minted in 1925 - 1928.In 1923, the first Soviet gold coin (1 chervonets in <b>nominal</b> <b>value)</b> was minted. This conformed in all its features to the gold coin worth of 10 rubles of Russian Empire. It almost never appeared in circulation and was only used in foreign trade transactions.Starting from 1926, coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 2, 3 and 5 were made of bronze; starting from 1931, coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 10, 15 and 20 kopecks were made of cuprum-nickel alloy.There has been a great variety of the first Soviet banknotes. In circulation were the Soviet chervonets (10 rubles) and the rubles designed to portray the symbols of the Soviet ideology. The types of banknotes of this period were often replacing each other.A monetary reform was passed in 1947 with a key objective to promote to a quick recovery of the war-suffered economy, withdrawal of counterfeit money from circulation and replacement of the old samples with new ones.The monetary reform of 1961 was aimed to change the price scale (10:1), improve the money cycle and issue banknotes of new design. New series of coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50 kopecks and 1 ruble {{were put into}} circulation. The series of banknotes consisted of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 rubles in nominal value.In 1991, to regulate the money cycle, banknotes in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50 and 100 rubles were withdrawn from circulation and substituted by new ones - banknotes of the 1991 series in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50 and 100 rubles (two different types). Later on, banknotes of the 1991 series in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 3, 5, 10, 200, 500 and 1000 rubles were put into circulation. Since February 1992, prices were liberalized, which led to the rise in prices and devaluation of the ruble. Banknotes of the 1992 series in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50, 200, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10000 rubles were put into circulation.|$|R

Banknotes of the former Soviet Union, in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1-500 rubles of the 1961-1992 issue were allowed to co-circulate with the Dram up until March 17, 1994.Coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 10, 20, 50 luma and 1, 3, 5, 10 drams of aluminum alloy were put into circulation since February 21, 1994.Banknotes in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1000 and 5000 drams were put into circulation since October 24, 1994 and September 6, 1995, respectively.Starting 1998, banknotes of the second series in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 20000 drams were put into circulation. The banknotes of this series meet modern requirements in terms of security, endurance, quality and design.On June 4, 2001, the commemorative banknote in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50000 drams dedicated to 1700th anniversary of adoption of Christianity in Armenia was put into circulation.In the period 2004 - 2005, the banknotes in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 50 and 100 drams of the 1993-1995 series and the 1998 series were withdrawn from circulation.

The banknote depicts the king Abgar the Fifth of Edessa. According to accounts of Armenian historians, Abgar was the first king of Armenian origin to have adopted Christianity.
