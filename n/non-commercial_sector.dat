Localisation is important because having software, a website or other content in several languages, and meeting several sets of cultural expectations is an important international marketing advantage. In the <b>non-commercial</b> <b>sector,</b> where information equality is deemed important, localisation also enables information access for less supported languages such as Galician. These requirements have led to increased localisation activities and act as a prompt to study how the localisation process can be optimised. A necessary pre-requisite for this, is a standardised localisation process. Such a process not only provides a basis for continuous quality improvement (CQI), but also {{has the potential to}} direct further research in the area. In terms of representing and enabling this standard localisation process, workflow technology provides an interesting solution. Workflows are concerned with formalising task structure: the order of subtask invocation, synchronisation and flow of information through the tasks, the roles of people that perform the tasks and the tracking and reporting of tasks.

40|$|The use of {{wireless}} mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) has gained rapid momentum, {{both in the}} commercial and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>sectors.</b> In the commercial sector, sensor networks are being considered for deployment {{for a wide variety}} of purposes including to sense robustness of elevators, bridges, and other structures and to explore the earth (e. g., oil, soil type, etc.). Examples in the noncommercial (military) sector include the use of MANETs in the battlefield. Regardless of the particular sector in which MANETs are being employed, one thing is common: MANETs are being used to collect, process, and relay vital information. As a result, it is critical that nodes in these networks be equipped to make decisions to ensure the integrity of information in an inherently unreliable environment. In this paper, we propose a Cross-layer Approach To Self-healing (CATS), in which nodes use information from each layer of the protocol stack to help the routing protocol maintain network reliability in the presence of failures. These actions serve both to provide uninterrupted communications amidst unforeseen failures and also to reduce packet latency and energy consumption. 1...|$|R

The objective of the present work is to inspect the structural analysis and clustering of complex knowledge granules in an IoT big-data environment. In this work, we propose a knowledge granule analytic and clustering (KGAC) framework that explores and assembles knowledge granules from IoT big-data arrays for a business intelligence (BI) application. Our work implements neuro-fuzzy analytic architecture rather than a standard fuzzified approach to discover the complex knowledge granules. Furthermore, we implement an enhanced knowledge granule clustering (e-KGC) mechanism that is more elastic than previous techniques when assembling the tactical and explicit complex knowledge granules from IoT big-data arrays. The analysis and discussion presented here show that the proposed framework and mechanism can be implemented to extract knowledge granules from an IoT big-data array {{in such a way as}} to present knowledge of strategic value to executives and enable knowledge users to perform further BI actions...|$|R

40|$|The {{state of}} {{diseases}} in South African domestic pigs drastically changed when Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) {{was introduced in}} the Western Cape Province during 2004 and was followed by an outbreak of Classical swine fever (CSF), primarily in the Eastern Cape, in 2005. These outbreaks occurred mostly in rural and backyard pig populations. Subsequent to an intensive culling operation, it became necessary to implement country-wide surveillance to substantiate that freedom from these two diseases had been achieved. Samples for a country-wide cross-sectional study were collected from commercial and non-commercial pig establishments in a combined effort between the South African Pig Producers Organisation (SAPPO) and the National and Provincial Departments of Agriculture, Veterinary Services. The survey targeted the high-risk sector of the pig population and included rural pig populations, pigs from “grey” herds (commercial farms with inadequate bio-security) and commercial establishments. Samples were also tested for Swine influenza (SI), Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), Aujeszky’s Disease (Aujeszky’s), Foot-and-mouth Disease (FMD) and African swine fever (ASF). The first objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the validity of the survey design. The second objective was to evaluate the results and, thereafter, make valid inferences regarding the disease status of the domestic pig population. This also included the confidence level of the overall survey. The third objective was to qualify and quantify sample losses to enable improved future survey design and execution. The outcome of the survey indicated that the results were sufficient to conclude that the non-commercial pig population is free from CSF, PRRS and SI at the expected minimum prevalence of 1 %. The calculations also indicated that the results were adequate to conclude that the commercial pig population is free from CSF, PRRS and SI at the expected minimum prevalence of 5 %. The outcome of the calculations done on the second phase test results allows South Africa to conclude that the non-commercial pig sector is free from FMD, ASF, Aujeszky’s and TGE, at the expected minimum prevalence of 2 %. The sample sizes for Aujeszky’s, TGE, ASF and FMD tests in the commercial sector were too small to allow for a decision to be made and, as a result, it was not possible to declare this sector free of disease. However, the <b>non-commercial</b> <b>sector</b> is much larger and the risk of disease introduction higher, therefore, if the <b>non-commercial</b> <b>sector</b> tested negative for the disease, it is highly likely that the commercial sector will be free of the disease as well. It is recommended that passive surveillance be augmented and that a national pig survey be conducted every 3 years to provide proof of disease freedom. It is important to conduct a risk analysis to qualify and quantify the risk of CSF and PRRS introduction. This could improve future surveys by providing a scientific basis for targeted surveillance.

40|$|The thesis {{sets out}} to {{evaluate}} the use of Causal Networks as a methodology and as a means of highlighting the problems associated with tourism in peripheral areas. Once these problems were identified through this process, the research findings are related to established literature and Lesson Drawing is evaluated as a means of comparative analysis. In attempting to utilise both Causal Networks and Lesson Drawing, three regions within Scotland were chosen as case studies. It was hoped that the selection of three regions within the same geographical propinquity would allow for Lessons to be both, imported and exported, from within the regions. The three regions chosen were Grampian; Inverness and Nairn; and Ross and Cromarty. An extensive literature search was conducted in an attempt to establish facts salient to the regions and primary research was carried out in all three regions. The primary research involved the use of an interview questionnaire. The respondents were all involved in tourism provision in one of the three case study regions. The interview data was collated and input onto conceptually clustered matrices. Causal Networks were constructed and analysed for each individual interview and for cognate groups and regions. Some tentative conclusions were drawn as a result of constructing the Causal Networks. These Causal Networks segmented the respondents into representative groups based on their functions or locations, for example commercial and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>sector</b> respondents or Grampian and Aberdeen City regional sector respondents. Using the Causal Networks opportunities for drawing lessons between the regions were highlighted. Finally, the effectiveness of both Casual Networks and Lesson Drawing methodologies were assessed in terms of their applicability for tourism provision in peripheral areas...|$|E

40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the role of}} serious games applications within healthcare and education to address the interests of both research and industry around the status of current and future developments. Disruptive technologies that have a high impact on business and society especially affect health-care and education. In addition, the pace of development in these areas is increasing exponentially, driven largely by gamification and social media. It is for these reasons that, {{in the areas of}} patient engagement and public expectations, healthcare providers are looking to these applications for so-lutions to health-related problems. The new publication “Subconscious Learning via Games and Social Media ” published by Springer aims to give an insight into these developments through the words of ac-knowledged international experts from both commercial and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>sectors.</b> The book shares the opinions of experts covering various aspects of healthcare, and its broad scope covers both general population and specific medical domains [1, 2]. For the education sector, consumer technologies, such as mobile phones and tablets, have had a major impact on learning for both adults and children. The potential of immersive technologies and serious games to engage and motivate within learning environments is increasingly widely accepted. This book seeks to explain the importance of understanding how to design serious games that can create long-term and lasting effects in both learning progress and the development of behavioral change [3]. This book also explains the best practice guidelines for the appli-cation of serious games to both adults and children.

40|$|In {{developing}} countries, official statistics, national accounts, {{and economic}} development initiatives generally focus on commercial, often export-oriented fisheries, which are often {{perceived to be the}} major economic contribution of fisheries. While small-scale, non-commercial fisheries, especially near-shore subsistence fisheries, have been recognized as fundamental for social, cultural, and food security reasons, their catches are seldom accounted for in official statistics. Thus, their contributions to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are often not taken into consideration. Previously undertaken catch time-series reconstructions for small-scale coastal fisheries of two US flag island areas in the tropical Pacific (American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands [CNMI]) provided estimates of total catches for 1982 â€“ 2002 (commercial and non-commercial) and suggested considerable discrepancies between reported (commercial) statistics and reconstructed (commercial plus noncommercial) estimates. We applied a valuation approach used by the Manila-based Asian Development Bank to the reconstructed catch data for non-pelagic species to estimate total near-shore fisheries contributions to national GDP using value-added estimators for each fisheries sector in combination with available price data for the period 1982 â€“ 2002. This suggested that the contributions of small-scale fisheries to GDP for these two island areas may have been underestimated by a factor of over five, and indicated that the <b>non-commercial</b> <b>sector</b> plays a more significant role in national accounts as contributors to GDP than currently assumed. This analysis should challenge existing perspectives of marginality of non-commercial fisheries sectors to developing countries in general and should give international development agencies, as well as local governments, pause to rethink their prioritization of fisheries development support.

40|$|Research PaperResponsibility for {{management}} of fisheries resources in waters off Queensland, Australia is vested {{largely in the}} Queensland Government, under the Offshore Constitutional Settlement agreed between {{the federal and state}} governments. These Queensland-managed fisheries include lucrative prawn fisheries and reef and coastal finfish fisheries off the east coast of Queensland and in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The key legislation is the Queensland Fisheries Act 1994 plus subordinate legislation including the Fisheries Regulation 1995 and fisheries management plans administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries. A review of the licensing and fees regime for commercial fishing operations has resulted in significant reforms which come into effect on 1 July 2006. Queensland’s licensing regime has been streamlined, fishery access rights have been made more secure, and various impediments to trading of fishing authorities and quota are being removed. Under the new system, fishery access fees are more equitable and better reflect the relative value of different fishing entitlements. Another policy initiative is a proposal for a limited compensation scheme. Under the proposed scheme, fishers would be eligible for compensation where amendments to management arrangements have been made to allocate resource access previously held by the commercial sector to a <b>non-commercial</b> <b>sector,</b> or to restrict commercial fishing entitlements in an area to protect marine life not covered under the Fisheries Act. Compensation would not be payable for amendments made for other reasons, such as the sustainability of the fishery. As part of a comprehensive review of the Fisheries Regulation 1995, the policy objectives of the existing provisions are also being reappraised to determine whether they are still relevant, and whether ‘black letter’ regulation or alternative non-legislative instruments would be the most appropriate approach to achieving the policy intent...|$|E
40|$|Despite their {{importance}} for human well-being, nearshore fisheries are often data poor, undervalued, and underappreciated in policy and development programs. We assess the value chain for nearshore Hawaiian coral reef fisheries, mapping post-catch distribution and disposition, and quantifying associated monetary, food security, and cultural values. We {{estimate that the}} total annual value of the nearshore fishery in Hawai'i is $ 10. 3 -$ 16. 4 million, composed of non-commercial ($ 7. 2 -$ 12. 9 million) and commercial ($ 2. 97 million licensed + $ 148, 500 -$ 445, 500 unlicensed) catch. Hawaii's nearshore fisheries provide > 7 million meals annually, with most (> 5 million) from the <b>non-commercial</b> <b>sector.</b> Over a third (36 %) of meals were planktivores, 26 % piscivores, 21 % primary consumers, and 18 % secondary consumers. Only 62 % of licensed commercial catch is accounted for in purchase reports, leaving 38 % of landings unreported in sales. Value chains are complex, with major buyers for the commercial fishery including grocery stores (66 %), retailers (19 %), wholesalers (14 %), and restaurants (< 1 %), who also trade and sell amongst themselves. The bulk of total nearshore catch (72 - 74 %) follows a short value chain, with non-commercial fishers keeping catch for household consumption or community sharing. A small amount (~ 37, 000 kg) of reef fish-the equivalent of 1. 8 % of local catch-is imported annually into Hawai'i, 23, 000 kg of which arrives as passenger luggage on commercial flights from Micronesia. Evidence of exports to the US mainland exists, but is unquantifiable given existing data. Hawaiian nearshore fisheries support fundamental cultural values including subsistence, activity, traditional knowledge, and social cohesion. These small-scale coral reef fisheries provide large-scale benefits to the economy, food security, and cultural practices of Hawai'i, underscoring the need for sustainable management. This research highlights the value {{of information on the}} value chain for small-scale production systems, making the hidden economy of these fisheries visible and illuminating a range of conservation interventions applicable to Hawai'i and beyond...|$|E

40|$|The cost of {{education}} and of public assistance in France (1815 - 1939) : a re-evaluation of the republican break. The aim {{of the present study}} is to re-evaluate the financial "break" in the realm {{of education}} and public assistance in France, a break which the rise of the Troisième République in generally though to have consummated. Such a re-evaluation essentially involves an examination of the complexity of the administrative system informing the <b>non-commercial</b> public <b>sector,</b> with all that this implies by way of internal financial movements, budgetary, transfers and private "assistance funds". The auter's calculations - which provide, along the way, estimates regarding the total sum of public expenses incurred by French territorial administrations from 1815 to 1939 - lead to reduction of the paradox between, on the one hand, what some historians have described as continuity in the process of elimination of illiteracy and in the system of public assistance throughout the period in question and, on the other hand, the more customary notion according to which the Troisième République invented education and social assistance, a notion based only on thejudical and financial orms assumed by the central State upon the Troisième Republiqueis establishment.

Part 1 Using a mixed methods research design, consisting of a countrywide cross-sectional survey among 3, 978 poultry keepers and interviews with experts from the poultry industry, revealed that: (i) risks perceived by the poultry keepers well reflected the officially communicated ones; (ii) having a non-commercial poultry farm was associated with low knowledge scores; (iii) both commercial and non-commercial farms were involved with remote between-farm contacts, which was in contrast to commonly presumed small poultry movement ranges in the <b>non-commercial</b> <b>sector.</b> Organizing demographic and epidemiological information in a relational poultry farm database would allow for considering more than one farm site per poultry keeper and facilitate multi-criteria queries. Part 2 Computer simulations comparing two types of individual-based models for the total outbreak size showed that: (i) models assuming a randomly mixed population provided acceptable estimates of the total outbreak size if the number of contacts per day was high or if the per-contact transmission probability was high; as well as for diseases with very short infectious periods; yet (ii) models considering the structure and stability of potentially contagious contacts were superior if the number of daily contacts or the transmission probability were low. Extrapolating the measured contact profiles on all poultry farms in Switzerland resulted in a synthetic poultry farm population characterized by heterogeneously distributed contacts with most farms having no or one contact and 4...|$|E

Schwartz, & G. W. Stevenson (Eds.), Diseases of swine (pp. 141 - 164). Chichester, England: Wiley-Blackwell. The New Zealand commercial pig industry is modern and highly productive. The industry is free {{from many of}} the important infectious diseases present in {{much of the rest of}} the world. However, alongside the commercial industry are a large number of non-commercial pig holdings operated with minimal attention to biosecurity. The extent to which the activities in the <b>non-commercial</b> <b>sector</b> might negatively impact the commercial sector was unknown therefore a series of projects was undertaken to explore the likelihood of an exotic disease occurring. A risk assessment was undertaken to determine the likelihood porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus would be introduced into New Zealand through imported fresh pork. The study estimated that at least 4. 3 pig herds per year were likely to become infected with PRRS and that 36 % of these incursions would spread to additional herds. It was recognized that the data describing the interactions between commercial and non-commercial pigs could be improved so a prospective study was undertaken to collect information about the movements of pigs and genetic material between farms. To assist in development of a national surveillance programme, two additional studies were then initiated. First, a study was conducted to determine the effect of blood sample mishandling on the performance of ELISA assays and second, a retrospective analysis of data from a national abattoir-based lesion recording system (PigCheck) was conducted. These studies were done with the realization that future surveillance activities would need to incorporate creative means of generating high-quality surveillance data, from various surveillance components, using both laboratory- and field-based staff. Investment Logic Mapping was then used to assist the industry in establishing a biosecurity and surveillance strategy. A single strategy ‘improve surveillance’ was identified as the key area for biosecurity investment. In response to this finding, modelling of potential surveillance activities was completed and a surveillance programme was proposed costing approximately $ 0. 50 per pig annually. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates the New Zealand pig industry is susceptible to introduction of an exotic disease and that the population of non-commercial pigs must be considered when developing biosecurity, and disease readiness or response plans for the commercial industry. The described studies show that a cost effective national disease surveillance programme can be implemented through use of a combination of existing and newly developed sources of surveillance information...|$|E

Indeed, commercial interests intent on maximizing the consumption of the immense collection of commodities have colonized {{more and more of}} the spaces of our culture. For instance, almost the entire media system (television and print) has been developed as a delivery system for marketers, and its prime function is to produce audiences for sale to advertisers. Both the advertisements it carries and the editorial matter that acts as a support for it celebrate the consumer society. The movie system, at one time outside the direct influence of the broader marketing system, is now fully integrated into it through the strategies of licensing, tie-ins and product placements.The prime function of many Hollywood films today is to aid in the selling of the immense collection of commodities. As public funds are drained from the <b>non-commercial</b> cultural <b>sector,</b> art galleries, museums and symphonies bid for corporate sponsorship."

40|$|Prior to the 1980 ’s, the {{government}} provided its citizens with public housing. As a consequence, {{there was a}} lack of investment in this sector. State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) were responsible for providing its workers with an apartment or other housing unit. SOEs allocated apartments under a series of rigid administrative regulations that resulted in a rental market with artificially low rents, no home ownership and average living space per capita that was less then 4 m 2. These conditions led the Chinese government to consider housing reforms by the end of the decade. During the 1980 's, along with other aspects of their economic system, China started to reform its urban housing sector. The housing reforms increased investment in the private (also know as commercial) and public (also known as <b>non-commercial)</b> housing <b>sectors.</b> As a result of these reforms, there are roughly 1 million annual housing starts today. The average living space is 8 - 10 m 2, with a goal of 12 m 2 by the year 2010. So far, the housing reforms are focused mainly in the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and those in Guangdong Province. The introduction of reforms has produced a dual-housing system in China. One segment of this dual system is the SOEs, which continue to provide the majority of housing to its employees. The other segment is the private housing sector, which operates in a more conventional, open housing market. Eventually China hopes to eliminate this dual-housing system. To do so additional market mechanisms must be undertaken to further develop an open, competitive housing market. These mechanisms involve reforms to price setting mechanisms that set current home sale prices and government-set rents. An important consideration will be a households’ income in establishing market price setting mechanisms. The recent reforms have led to two problems. One is that the price on the ‘open housing market’ is too high to be affordable by average urban residents. As a result there is currently an overstock of newly built housing that was constructed for affluent households. The other problem is that government-set rents can’t be raised to market levels without a significant wage adjustment. Thus wage reform will be just as important for housing reform to be successful. Housing reforms will need to be monitored along with other economic reforms in China. SOEs still control much of the urban housing stock—i. e. the majority of housing is in the public, <b>non-commercial</b> housing <b>sector.</b> The reliance of employees on their work units for their housing needs has not fundamentally changed under the reforms undertaken to date. Successful housing reforms will depend on the reform of SOEs. Wage and housing reforms, and controlling unemployment are a part of much larger and more complicated SOEs reforms. In large part, SOEs reforms will be key for housing reforms to be successful. It is estimated that housing reforms generated $ 80 billion in new household-related spending in 1998 (9 % of GDP) and $ 150 billion in 1999. However, housing reforms are major undertakings, which will gradually, rather than immediately, bring opportunities for foreign firms. Continued success in generating economic activity will promote further reforms. China’s prediction of 10 % annual growth in domestic demand over the next ten years may be overoptimistic, but disposable income has increased by an average of 6 % in urban areas over the last five years, and 5. 4 % in rural areas. A continued growth in income is likely to have a substantial effect on the domestic demand for wood products, hence the outlook for a growing market in China for wood products is optimistic. Rising incomes among China’s emerging middle class, many of whom still live in accommodations provided by their employer, has also raised spending levels on furniture and interior wood products. Demand will initially depend on affluent families that can afford a home purchase and separation from SOEs housing subsidies. As more middle class families become affluent, they also will likely renovate existing units or move into new apartments. Those dependent on heavily subsidized state housing are not likely to contribute much to any potential increase in wood products demand, however. Hence the transition to a western-style housing market is likely to be slow and intimately coupled with wage reforms and the transformation of SOEs to competitive industries. As this happens, over the next several years, demand will grow for higher quality products such as flooring, molding, windows, doors, cabinets, paneling, wall units and furniture. It is expected that consumption of these products will develop into a significant market following these transitions. Over the last decade and more, China’s furniture industry has attained unprecedented development; its output during the period 1986 - 1997 had developed from 120 million pieces to 476 million pieces, with an average annual increase of 39. 8 %. Total output value of the industry as of 1998 reached 78 billion RMB and then in 1999 with growth rate to an estimation of 12 %. Timber is an important raw material for the furniture industry. A large furniture sector will depend more heavily on imports of timber...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{challenge}} facing science {{is how to}} renew and improve its relationship with society. One potential solution {{is to ensure that}} the public are more involved in the scientific process from the inception of research plans to scientific dissemination strategies. However, to date, little is known about how research funding bodies view public participation in research funding decisions, and how they involve the public into their strategies and practices. This paper provides insights into how key representatives working in the UK <b>non-commercial</b> research funding <b>sector</b> perceive public participation in health-related research funding decisions and the possible implications of these. Methods: We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with 30 key stakeholders from 10 UK non-commercial research funding bodies that either partially or exclusively fund health-related research. The findings were written up in thematic narrative form. Results: The different disciplines that encompass health research, and their differing frames of ‘science and society’, were found to influence how research funding bodies viewed and implemented public participation in research funding decisions. Relevant subsets of the public {{were more likely to be}} involved in research funding decisions than lay public, which could be linked to underlying technocratic rationales. Concerns about public participation stemmed from the highly professionalised scientific environment that the public were exposed to. Additionally, from a more positivist frame, concerns arose regarding subjective views and values held by the public that may damage the integrity of science. Conclusion: Underlying assumptions of technocracy largely appear to be driving PP/PE within the research grant review process, even in funding bodies that have overtly democratic ideals. Some conceptions of technocracy were more inclusive than others, welcoming different types of expertise such as patient or research-user experiences and knowledge, while others suggested taking a narrower and more positivist view of expertise as techno-scientific expertise. For research to have its maximum impact when translated into healthcare, health policies and health technologies, there needs to be sensitivity towards multiple frames of knowledge, expertise and underlying values that exist across science and society...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} access and benefit-sharing (ABS) {{grew out of}} the {{emergence}} of the global governance of genetic resources {{during the second half of}} the twentieth century. The evolution of environmental ethics, of international environmental law, of North–South relations, and of international cooperation for scientific research all nourished an international regime, which eventually led to the Nagoya Protocol. The Protocol thus is the product of a series of international legal doctrines, as exposed in the introduction of this book. Likewise, the implementation of the Protocol will need to build on a series of existing legal principles and rules, which are currently governing issues related to access and benefit-sharing. As illustrated throughout the chapters in the first part of the book, these issues are numerous and differ from country to country, including inter alia property regimes, market regulation and access, industrial policy, health, international development, legislation related to environmental matters and nature conservation, agriculture, research & development traditional knowledge, administrative laws, and private international law. In addition, the imple mentation will have to complement and/or further a plethora of quasi-legal instruments, best practices and private standards, all of which may or may not have been designed with ABS or the Nagoya Protocol in mind. Finally, European ABS instruments will also converge at the European level, where an EU-harmonised approach on compliance measures for users from the Nagoya Protocol was adopted in April 2014. 1 The story of the Nagoya Protocol thus can be said to be one of legal confluence: born out of a union of legal doctrines, it gathers a large range of legal fields extending far beyond environmental law only, and combines (or will need to combine) existing legal regimes, numerous actors, both public and private, and a multitude of policy and private initiatives. The confluence of these different streams into a functional ABS regime is of paramount importance for the EU, in particular for its biotechnology <b>sector</b> and its <b>non-commercial</b> biodiversity research <b>sectors...</b>|$|R
