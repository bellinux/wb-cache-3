We screened {{the expression of}} miRNA in goat mammary glands during peak-lactation and <b>non-lactating</b> (“dry”) <b>periods,</b> and performed an in vitro study with goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC) prior to sequencing analysis. Results illustrated that miR- 30 e- 5 p and miR- 15 a were highly expressed. Utilizing a luciferase reporter assay and Western blot, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP 6) and Yes associated protein 1 (YAP 1) genes were demonstrated to be a target of miR- 30 e- 5 p and miR- 15 a in GMEC.

40|$|Most {{dairy cows}} {{generally}} have a <b>non-lactating,</b> “dry <b>period</b> ” prior to parturition. As the milk production of dairy cows {{has increased dramatically}} during the last decades, cows managed conventionally with a 12 to 13 month-calving interval are dried off (DO) while still producing significant quantities of milk. The DO period {{is probably one of}} the most physiologically demanding periods for the high-yielding dairy cow, and may negatively affect animal welfare, but few studies have been performed in this area. Therefore, the general aim of the present work was to investigate how different DO procedures and milk yield at DO affect metabolism and udder health of the dairy cow. Furthermore, the effects of different calving intervals and breed were also evaluated. Three studies are included in this thesis. In the first study cows were randomly assigned to two different feeding treatments. One group was fed straw ad libitum, while the other group was fed silage [4 kg dry matter (DM) ] daily and straw ad libitum to evaluate metabolic changes and health during DO. In the second study, the effects of daily milk yield at DO, different calving intervals (12 and 15 months) and breed on metabolism and udder health were studied when feeding additional silage at DO.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effect of oral drenching with molasses, calcium propionate and MgO on plasma glucose and calcium concentrations of dairy cows. Four trials were undertaken, each using three lactating and three non-lactating Jersey cows. In Trial 1, the effect of drenching with 200 ml molasses was measured. Trial 2 measured the effect of a single treatment with 349 g calcium propionate in 200 ml molasses. In Trial 3, the effect of 60 g MgO in molasses alone and in combination with calcium propionate was measured. Trial 4 tested the effect of repeating treatments with 349 g calcium propionate in 200 ml molasses 24 h apart. Dosing with 349 g calcium propionate in molasses increased plasma total calcium (Catot) concentration by 10 % in lactating and <b>non-lactating</b> cows for <b>periods</b> less than 7 h, and this was not augmented by simultaneous administration of MgO or treatment 24 h earlier with 349 g calcium propionate in molasses. Treatment with 200 ml molasses alone resulted in increased plasma Catot of 7 %. Plasma glucose concentrations were elevated by 11 % for less than 3 h after treatment with calcium propionate. For the prevention of subclinical hypocalcaemia and ketosis in early lactation, drenching with calcium propionate solutions is unlikely to be of value due to the short duration of its effects, but the inclusion of calcium propionate in the postpartum ration deserves further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{to what extent the}} {{sensitivity}} of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may be state dependent and vary in the same species between environments. Here we tested whether the faecal corticosteroid concentrations of matrilineal adult female spotted hyenas are influenced by social and reproductive status in adjacent ecosystems and whether they vary between periods with and without social stress. Females in the Serengeti National Park frequently become socially subordinate intruders in other hyena territories by undertaking long-distance foraging trips to migratory herds, whereas in the Ngorongoro Crater they usually forage inside their own small territories on resident prey. The faecal corticosteroid concentrations in Serengeti females were significantly higher than in Ngorongoro females. Energy expenditure by lactation is exceptionally high in spotted hyenas and this may be reflected in their corticosteroid levels. The faecal corticosteroid levels in both populations were higher in lactating than in <b>non-lactating</b> females. During <b>periods</b> of social stability, faecal corticosteroid concentrations increased in non-lactating females but not in lactating females as social status declined. Lactating Serengeti females had significantly higher faecal corticosteroid concentrations during periods with acute severe social stress than during periods without, indicating that the HPA axis is sensitive to social stimuli even in lactating females. So far few studies have used non-invasive monitoring methods for assessing social stress in freeranging animals. This study demonstrates for the first time, to the authors' knowledge, that corticosteroid concentrations may differ between periods with and without social stress for a free-ranging female mammal and that the modulating effect of social status may depend on reproductive status...|$|R

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to blanket dry cow therapy (BDCT), selective dry cow therapy (SDCT) is considered a more judicious approach to antimicrobial use {{for the purpose of}} mastitis control during the <b>non-lactating</b> <b>period.</b> The purpose of this research was to evaluate the utility of a 3 M Petrifilm-based on-farm milk culture system (OFCS) for use in a SDCT program. A randomized clinical trial was conducted using 16 low bulk tank somatic cell count (< 250, 000 cells/mL) dairy herds from Prince Edward Island (n = 10) and Quebec (n = 6), Canada. When used to detect intramammary infection (IMI) in cows at drying off, the OFCS performed well with a sensitivity of 85 % and specificity of 73 %. By comparing producer-derived Petrifilm results to those obtained using an accurate automated reader, it was determined that producers were able to correctly interpret Petrifilm results with an observed agreement of 91 % and kappa value of 0. 82. The study groups comprising the clinical trial were a positive control group consisting of cows receiving blanket application of dry cow therapy (DCT) with the addition of an internal teat sealant (ITS), and the OFCS group consisting of cows selectively treated at drying off based on OFCS results with ITS alone (Petrifilm negative) or DCT + ITS (Petrifilm positive). No significant differences in postcalving IMI risk and risk of clinical mastitis in the first 120 days of the subsequent lactation were detected between the study groups. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between study groups regarding test day milk yield and somatic cell count in the first 180 days of the subsequent lactation. Petrifilm-OFCS-based SDCT enabled a reduction in DCT of 21 % as compared to BDCT. The effect of ITS on the interdependence of quarters towards the acquisition of new IMI (NIMI) with coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) over the dry period was also investigated. It was demonstrated that in cows that were infused with ITS, the presence of CNS in another quarter at drying off was a risk factor for CNS NIMI, but this association was absent in cows without ITS infusion. This unexpected finding may have resulted from inadvertent introduction of CNS during ITS infusion. In quarters of cows without a CNS IMI at drying off (i. e. without a source of contagious CNS), ITS was protective against CNS NIMI suggesting that CNS infection over the <b>non-lactating</b> <b>period</b> can be partly attributed to CNS species located within the environment. According to economic analyses, OFCS-based SDCT resulted in a marginally higher total cost per cow than BDCT. However, OFCS-based SDCT provided the combined benefits of lowering DCT treatment risk without increasing the risk of postcalving IMI, and was superior economically to a SDCT program based on somatic cell count and clinical mastitis history. Overall, the Petrifilm OFCS was an accurate diagnostic tool that was effective in reducing DCT use without compromising the health, welfare, and future milk production of the cow...|$|E

Some other important observations to consider is that drying times were significant less when dip was applied to teats compared to test tubes with Blue being ~ 2 - 4 min. Also, when animals bumped or kicked while dipping, significantly more dip is wasted than what drips off teats. These 2 points, in conjunction with the above points on persistency, should be highly considered when deciding to alter or put new dips into the marketplace...|$|E
40|$|Cows are {{susceptible}} to new Escherichia coli intramammary infections (IMI) in the <b>non-lactating</b> <b>period</b> of late gestation (known as the ‘dry period’). These IMI often persist up until parturition without inducing highly inflammatory responses and {{increase the risk of}} postpartum mastitis in the subsequent lactation. The bovine maternal immune system is hypothesized to be regulated during late gestation to prevent highly inflammatory, cell-mediated responses however the mechanisms in generating such tolerance have not been fully elucidated. In other mammalian species mononuclear phagocytes play a primary role in generating maternal immune tolerance, and although beneficial for the fetus, often negatively impacts immune responses to invading pathogens. The work presented here investigated changes in maternal immunity and its relationship to dry period E. coli IMI dynamics through the use of experimental and mathematical approaches. The objectives were to 1) characterize changes in blood monocyte composition and monocyte-derived dendritic cell (moDC) function over pregnancy to identify unique changes in late gestation, 2) investigate pregnancy-associated factors that regulate these cells, 3) investigate the relationship between maternal immune regulation and dry period E. coli IMI dynamics and risk of postpartum mastitis through mathematical models, and 4) investigate the effect of intramammary immunization with UV-killed E. coli on IMI dynamics and host response. Pregnancy was accompanied with a decrease in inflammatory monocytes and impaired moDC maturation following E. coli stimulation. Aspects of hindered moDC maturation could be induced by in vitro treatment of late gestation levels of progesterone and estradiol. Deviations in prepartum monocyte composition related to risk of postpartum disease. Mathematical model results indicated these shifts in cytokine production alone were not able to recapitulate IMI dynamics in the dry period, but rather it involved an interaction between maternal immune regulation and physiological and immunological changes to the mammary gland that accompany the dry period. Intramammary immunization at dry-off generated protective responses against E. coli challenge later in the dry period. Overall, shifts in maternal immunity both in the periphery and in the mammary gland during the dry period relate to persistent E. coli IMI and postpartum mastitis, and local immunity can be manipulated to generate protection against IMI in the dry period...|$|E

Fifty-two Holstein and cross-bred cows were utilized at the University of Minnesota (U of MN) St. Paul dairy (STP) and 62 Holstein cows at the U of MN Northwest Research and Outreach Center (NWROC, Crookston, MN) dairy. Treatments were: 1) 100 % inorganic trace mineral supplementation (CON); 2) organic trace mineral supplemented at the following rate: 40 % of supplemented zinc (Zn), 24 % of supplemented manganese (Mn), 69 % of supplemented copper (Cu) and 100 % of supplemented cobalt (Co) supplied by 4 -Plex (Zinpro Corp., Eden Prairie, MN; OTM) and 3) OTM with additional Zn from Zn-methionine (OTMZ). Dietary trace mineral supplements were formulated to provide similar amounts of Co, Cu and Mn. Dietary Zn supplemental amounts were similar for CON and OTM (75 mg/d), but approximately two times higher for OTMZ. Heifer calves born from the cows at STP and all calves born at NWROC were evaluated for feed intake and growth performance through 56 d of age. Bull calves born at STP were used in a study to evaluate the affect of additional Zn on intestinal development. Under conditions of the current study, treatment during the dry period did not have an effect on milk yield. Number of pregnant multiparous cows at NWROC fed OTMZ tended (P = 0. 09) to be greater at 150 days in milk compared to CON and OTM. There were no effects of treatment on colostrum protein or immunoglobulin concentration at either location. For STP and primiparous cows at NWROC, treatments did not significantly affect the fat content of colostrum. Treatment did affect colostrum fat concentration from multiparous cows at NWROC with cows fed OTMZ having a higher concentration of fat in colostrum than cows fed CON.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{proportion}} of Calluna vulgaris cover on diet composition, intake and performance of sheep grazing hill vegetation communities in northern Spain is examined. A total of 591 non-lactating Gallega ewes grazed for five consecutive grazing seasons (June to September) on replicated plots of hill pastures (1700 m. a. s. l.) composed principally of Festuca, Agrostis, Nardus and Calluna spp. but with different proportions of Calluna vulgaris cover, either 0 · 3 (C 0 · 3) or 0 · 7 (C 0 · 7) of the total area. In 1 year, twenty-eight ewes suckling single lambs also grazed the plots. The mean stocking density over the 5 years was 8 · 7 ewes ha– 1. On treatment C 0 · 3, daily liveweight gains (33 g d– 1) of non-lactating ewes were significantly (P < 0 · 001) greater than on treatment C 0 · 7 (12 g d– 1). Likewise in lactating ewes the difference in mean daily liveweight change was 40 g d– 1 (– 5 vs. – 45 g d– 1 for C 0 · 3 and C 0 · 7 treatments respectively; P < 0 · 001). Liveweight gains of lambs were only 80 – 100 g d– 1 from June to August and lambs only maintained live weight during August and September. The effect of lactational status on liveweight changes was not significant. Liveweight gains of non-lactating ewes increased significantly (P < 0 · 001) from the first to {{the last year of}} the experiment on both treatments. The composition of the diet was significantly affected by treatment (P < 0 · 001), with a higher proportion of grass species on the C 0 · 3 treatment and a higher digestibility of the diet {{in the first half of}} the grazing season (P < 0 · 001). The proportion of C. vulgaris in the diet was significantly (P < 0 · 001) higher on the C 0 · 7 treatment and increased significantly (P < 0 · 001) from July to September on both treatments. There were no significant differences in the composition of the diet selected by lactating and non-lactating ewes. The results demonstrate that on hill vegetation communities, in which the grass components (Festuca rubra, Agrostis capillaris, and Nardus stricta) cover at least 0 · 3 of the area and on which the preferred grass component (Festuca and Agrostis spp.) is maintained at a sward height of at least 2 · 5 cm, non-lactating ewes can increase their live weight and body condition, but this increase is influenced by the proportion and quantity of species of grass in the diet, which is affected in turn by the species of grass available and their nutritive quality. However, ewes suckling lambs were not able to maintain their live weight and body condition except when Calluna cover was 0 · 3 and grass height was more than 3 · 5 cm. It is concluded that these indigenous vegetation communities can be used in sheep production systems to complement the use of improved pastures at other times of year. In particular, they can be utilized during the <b>non-lactating</b> <b>period</b> (summer) to increase body condition before the beginning of the mating period in autumn...|$|E
