40|$|Research and {{development}} of a safety system for the SPIRAL 2 facility has been conceived to protect the UCx target from a possible interaction with the 200 kW deuteron beam. The system called "delay window" (DW) is designed {{as an integral part}} of the <b>neutron</b> <b>converter</b> module and is located in between the <b>neutron</b> <b>converter</b> and the fission target. The device has been designed as a barrier, located directly behind the <b>neutron</b> <b>converter</b> on the axis of the deuteron beam, with the purpose of "delaying" the eventual interaction of the deuteron beam with the UCx target in case of a failure of the <b>neutron</b> <b>converter.</b> The "delay" must be long enough to allow the interlock to react and safely stop the beam operation, before the beam will reach the UCx target. The working concept of the DW is based on the principle of the electrical fuse. Electrically insulated wires placed on the surface of a Tantalum disk assure a so called "free contact", normally closed to an electronic circuit located on the HV platform, far from the radioactive environment. The melting temperature of the wires is much less than Tantalum. Once the beam is impinging on the disk, one or more wires are melted and the "free contact" is open. A solid state relay is changing its state and a signal is sent to the interlock device. A prototype of the DW has been constructed and tested with an electron beam of power density equivalent to the SPIRAL 2 beam. The measured "delay" is 682. 5 ms (σ= 116 ms), that is rather long in comparison to the intrinsic delays introduced by the detectors itself (2 ms) and by the associated electronic devices (120 ns). The experimental results confirm that, in the case of a failure of the <b>neutron</b> <b>converter,</b> the DW as conceived is enable to withstand the beam power for a period of time sufficiently long to safely shut down the SPIRAL 2 accelerator...|$|E

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is focused on {{characterisation}} and evaluation of two classes of science grade imaging radiation detectors. The first class is Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). The advances in CMOS fabrication technologies {{over the last four}} decades allowed MAPS to compete with Charge-Coupled Devices (CCD) in many applications. The technology also provides relatively inexpensive ways to tailor design to suit specific application needs. It is important to understand performance capabilities of new sensor designs through characterisation and optimisation of readout parameters. In this work three MAPSs were characterised. The first one - HEPAPS 4 - designed for charged particle detection, with the potential technology application in the vertex detector for the International Linear Collider. The noise of the sensor was measured to be 35 ± 5 e, which agrees well with simulated data. The dark current was found to be 175 pA/cm 2. The SNR performance for minimum ionising particles detection was demonstrated to be 40. The sensor was also evaluated for indirect detection of thermal and fast neutrons using lithium and polyethylene converters. The technology performed well in such an application with an estimated fast neutron detection efficiency of ~ 0. 01 %. The second sensor characterised – Vanilla MAPS – was designed to evaluate new techniques for fast readout, small noise and reduced image lag. The system was capable to readout 150 full frames (520 x 520 pixels) per second; the sensor showed 14 ± 4 e noise and decreased image lag. The dark current was found to be ~ 50 pA/cm 2. The back-thinned version of the sensor demonstrated dramatic improvement in quantum efficiency from 0 % to 20 % at 220 nm. The third device is parametric sensor eLeNA. It features 14 test structure designed to evaluated noise reduction architectures. The most promising structures showed temporal noise values as low as 6 e and 20 e fixed pattern noise. Medipix {{as an example of the}} second class of imaging detectors - hybrid pixel detectors - was evaluated in two applications. It was used as the core element of the ATLAS radiation background monitoring system. The sensors were covered with <b>neutron</b> <b>converters,</b> which extended the number of radiation types that can be detected. X-ray calibration was performed, showing excellent tolerance of all 18 devices characterised. Detection efficiencies were estimated to be ~ 1 % for thermal and ~ 0. 1 % for fast neutrons. The second application of Medipix was mass spectrometry. The detector was place in the focal plane of a prototype mass spectrometer. 2 D representation of data allowed focusing correction of the ion beam. The system was capable to detect ions in the range of 5 - 25 keV. The detector characterisation with broad range of ions (from Cu to Pb) showed very good abundance agreement with table data.
