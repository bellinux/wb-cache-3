5|$|The Trait du Nord is an {{endangered}} breed; the Haras de Compiègne (Compiegne Stud), a national stud in France, {{had a major}} influence in saving the breed, until it was closed in October 2009. The national breed registry for the Trait du Nord is supported by other local initiatives. However, breed numbers were already low when these initiatives began to be implemented, and media attention on the Trait du Nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest. The breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms, but even the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> has been decreasing as many young farmers prefer more to breed cattle, which are more lucrative.|$|E
5|$|After departing New Richmond, {{the tornado}} moved {{on toward the}} northeast, {{continuing}} along a course almost parallel to the Omaha Railroad line, with most of its destruction after that point confined to rural areas, with only two fatalities occurring north of town. The tornado struck several farms in the Stanton area, passing barely a mile north of the village of Deer Park before crossing into Polk County. The storm came within two miles of the village of Clear Lake, {{proving to be a}} great scare for its residents as it reminded many of a similar tornado which struck Clear Lake in September 1884. A large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> in the area suffered considerable damage, and many families were left homeless. One farmer, Sam Olson was killed instantly when the tornado flattened his farmstead, leaving his wife and son gravely injured. Northeast of Clear Lake, the tornado tore through the logging community of Pineville, where another farmer, Michael Kennetz, was killed when his home was swept away. Several homes and farms {{in the vicinity of the}} hamlet of Richardson and the village of Clayton were blown away, leaving several families destitute. The storm continued east into Barron County, where the farming community of Arland sustained a direct hit, with virtually the entire settlement being demolished, but no fatalities or serious injuries being reported. The tornado dissipated a few miles southwest of the city of Barron, although the storm was still strong enough to cause a considerable amount of damage to the town.|$|E

25|$|Although Willow Bunch was {{consistently}} populated by {{farms in the}} early 1900s, the economic landscape began changing in the 1920s and continues to change today. Entering the 1930s, Willow Bunch’s district saw as many as 8,939 active farms. The Great Depression factored into the disappearance of numerous smaller farms, while large farms grew. During this time the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> decreased, while the average farm size increased by 73 acres. Entering 1941 the average size of farms became larger, {{and the amount of}} farms decreased from 8,939 to 8,002. This trend continued into the 1950s, with a government survey recording 421 farms in 1951 and 354 farms in 1956. Again, the average size of farms increased while the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> decreased. The trend continues, with a 2011 Statistics Canada report noting only 102 farms remain in the Willow Bunch area (with under 2,000 in the greater District). Furthermore, the majority of farms in the province span 1,600-2,239 acres, while smaller farms (under 200 acres) are becoming a minority. In response to larger farms, small organic farms have sprung up in Willow Bunch. Although these farms are small, the prices commanded by organic goods allows these farms to operate comfortably.|$|E
25|$|Funds {{earmarked}} {{for the purchase}} of white farms were frequently diverted into defence expenditure throughout the mid 1980s, for which Zimbabwean officials received some criticism. Reduction of funding posed another dilemma: property prices were now beyond what the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement, and Redevelopment could afford to meet its goals. It was also unable to build sufficient roads, clinics, and schools for the large number of people it was resettling in new areas. After 1983, the domestic budget could no longer sustain resettlement measures, and despite British aid the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> being purchased gradually declined {{for the remainder of the}} decade.|$|E

25|$|With {{this growth}} and {{evolving}} economy, the port and town also experienced expansion.

25|$|The {{population}} of Norway increased from 150,000 in 1500 to 900,000 in 1800. By 1500 most deserted farms were repossessed. The period under absolutism increased {{the ratio of}} self-owning farmers from twenty to fifty percent, largely through sales of crown land to finance the lost wars. Crofts became common in the absolutism period, especially in Eastern Norway and Trøndelag, with the smallholder living {{at the mercy of}} the farmer. There were 48,000 smallholders in 1800. Compared to Denmark, taxes were very low in Norway, typically at four to ten percent of the harvest, although the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> per legd decreased from four to two in the 1670s. Confirmation was introduced in 1736; as it required people to read, elementary education was introduced. The Norwegian economy improved with the introduction of the water-driven saw in the early 16th century. Norway had huge resources of timber but did not have the means to exploit much of it in the Middle Ages as only hand-tools were available. The new saw mills which sprang up in the fjords changed this. In 1544 a deal was struck with the Netherlands (then part of the Holy Roman Empire) and the Dutch controlled the export of Norwegian timber for the next 150 years. Amsterdam was built on piles from Norway. Tree-felling was done in the winter when farm-work was impossible and it was easy to get the felled trees across the snow to the rivers. In the spring, the logs floated down the rivers to the saw mills by the sea. By the mid-16th century the power of the Hanseatic League in Bergen was broken; though German craftsmen remained, they had to accept Danish rule. Many Norwegians earned a living as sailors in foreign ships, especially Dutch ones. The crews in both sides of the Anglo-Dutch Wars contained Norwegians. Norway benefitted from the many European wars of the 18th century. As a neutral power it was able to expand its share of the shipping market. It also supplied timber to foreign navies.|$|E
