5|$|In 1929, Hammond married Dorothy Lister, the {{daughter}} of a Yorkshire textile merchant, in a highly publicised ceremony at a parish church in Bingley. They met at a cricket match in 1927 but spent little time together before the wedding, having little in common. When married, they rarely communicated or got on well. Acquaintances believed Hammond treated her badly, particularly once her father lost <b>nearly</b> <b>everything</b> in the Depression, causing them financial worry. She remained loyal, but their relations gradually broke down, even after she sailed to South Africa, joining Hammond on tour in 1939 in an attempt to save the marriage. By that time, he was already seeing his future second wife, Sybil Ness-Harvey, a former beauty queen whom he had met while on tour.|$|E
5|$|On Bora-Bora, {{an island}} {{which had a}} {{population}} of 4,500 at the time, roughly 30% of the infrastructure was destroyed, including 309houses. Hotels were also impacted during the storm. On {{the north side of}} Bora Bora, <b>nearly</b> <b>everything</b> was destroyed, including the village of Vaitape and a local yacht club. Across Vaitape, roads were blocked by fallen trees and telecommunication lines were severed due to high winds. Sevenpeople on the island were reportedly slightly injured. In addition, the islands of Tahaa, Raiatea, and Moorea all sustained damage, though yachts in Raiatea managed to survive unscathed. In another archipelago, 700homes and various public infrastructures were at least somewhat destroyed by Osea. In addition to the impact on infrastructure, banana trees were knocked down due to the winds, especially in mountain gardens. Throughout the impacted region, no deaths were reported.|$|E

5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging parents and the business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time and attention to the exclusion of <b>nearly</b> <b>everything</b> else, and are accounted as some {{of the reasons for the}} author's declining artistry and her {{lack of interest in}} producing children's books.|$|E
5|$|The arid {{conditions}} of the spiny forest, which receives less than 600 millimeters of rainfall each year, largely shape Mikea economic activities. <b>Nearly</b> <b>everything</b> they consume is scavenged from the forest, and the average Mikea needs two hours or less to collect adequate food for the day. Their main source of food is tubers, particularly {{during the dry season}} when few other foods may be reliably available. Adults and children of both genders work to dig up using a metal-tipped digging stick (antsoro) and a digging bowl (kipao). The starchy ovy tuber is roasted or boiled before eating, while the Mikea eat the watery babo (or baboho) raw for hydration or use its water for boiling other foods; the tavolo tuber is dried and ground to make a flour that is sold at village markets. They also gather forest fruits, melons and honey, with the latter a particularly important source of income for the Mikea during the rainy season. To obtain water during the rainy season the Mikea capture rain run-off from the rooftops of their houses using hollowed-out logs or transport water on foot or zebu-drawn wagon from the villages, while during the cool dry season the Mikea consume their store of water-engorged babo tubers and drink water from natural or man-made wells when possible.|$|E

McKenzie attended Lehigh University from 1891 to 1895, where he earned a B.S. and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Upon graduating from Lehigh University in 1895, McKenzie spent the summer studying at the University of Pennsylvania under Franklin Henry Giddings, a prominent sociologist and economist from Bryn Mawr College, and Simon Nelson Patten, Professor of Economics at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. For the next two years, McKenzie tutored families of railroad officials of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1897, Martin Grove Brumbaugh, a long-time McKenzie family friend and President of Juniata College, in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, offered McKenzie a position at the college teaching French, German, English, history, and economics. In 1900, Brumbaugh, who was to become Governor of Pennsylvania from 1915 to 1919, helped McKenzie secure a scholarship to pursue doctoral work in sociology and economics at the University of Pennsylvania. To help pay his living expenses while in school, McKenzie taught modern languages at the Blight School for Boys in Philadelphia, often teaching five hours prior to going to the university for classes and study in the evening.|$|E
