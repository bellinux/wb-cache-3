5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{is one of}} the ten most visited {{national}} parks in the U.S., with an annual average of 2.75million visitors in the period from 2007 to 2016, with 3.27 million visiting in 2016. The National Park Service is a federal agency of the United States Department of the Interior and manages both Grand Teton National Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Grand Teton National Park has an average of 100 permanent and 180 seasonal employees. The park also manages 27 concession contracts that provide services such as lodging, restaurants, mountaineering guides, dude ranching, fishing and a boat shuttle on Jenny Lake. The National Park Service works closely with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and also, in consequence of Jackson Hole Airport's presence in the park, the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial construction of the airstrip north of the town of Jackson was completed in the 1930s. When Jackson Hole National Monument was designated, the airport was inside it. After the monument and park were combined, the Jackson Hole Airport became the only commercial airport within a U.S. National Park. Jackson Hole Airport has some of the strictest <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> regulations of any airport in the U.S. The airport has night flight curfews and overflight restrictions, with pilots being expected to approach and depart the airport along the east, south or southwest flight corridors. As of 2010, 110 privately owned property inholdings, many belonging to the state of Wyoming, are located within Grand Teton National Park. Efforts to purchase or trade these inholdings for other federal lands are ongoing and through partnerships with other entities, 10million dollars is hoped to be raised to acquire private inholdings by 2016. Some monies are allocated from congress via the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but Grand Teton National Park may not get all the money needed from the fund as it is divided up between four different federal agencies. Efforts to exchange federal land from other areas for inholdings were still in the negotiation phase in 2012.|$|E

40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s {{competitive}} aerospace industry, {{the quest}} for quiet has drawn significant attention to both the interior and exterior design of an airplane. Understanding the noise generation mechanisms of a jet aircraft is a crucial first step toward developing the most cost-effective <b>noise</b> and vibrations <b>abatement</b> methods. In this investigation, the Helmholtz Equation Least Squares (HELS) based nearfield acoustic holography {{will be used to}} understand noise transmission caused by jet engine and turbulence into the fuselage of a jet aircraft cruising at 30, 000 ft. Modern propulsive jet engines produce exterior noise sources with a high amplitude noise field and complicated characteristics, which makes them very difficult to characterize. In particular, there are turbulent eddies that are moving through the jet at high speeds along the jet boundary. These turbulent eddies in the shear layer produce a directional and frequency dependent noise. The original HELS approach assumes a spherical source at the origin and computes the acoustic field based on spherical emission from this source. This assumption of one source at the origin is not sufficient to characterize a complex source like a jet. As such, a modified HELS approach is introduced that will help improve the source characterization as it is not dependent on a single source at the origin but a number of virtual sources throughout the space. Custom microphones are created to take acoustic pressure measurements around the jet engine. These measured acoustic pressures are then taken as input to the modified HELS algorithm to visualize the noise pattern of a subsonic jet engine...|$|R
40|$|The current {{research}} focuses on predictability, variability and operational feasibility aspect of Continuous Descent Approach (CDA), which is among the key concepts of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). The idle-thrust CDA is a fuel economical, <b>noise</b> and emission <b>abatement</b> procedure, but requires increased separation to accommodate for variability and uncertainties in vertical and speed profiles of arriving aircraft. Although {{a considerable amount of}} researches have been devoted to the estimation of potential benefits of the CDA, only few have attempted to explain the predictability, variability and operational feasibility aspect of CDA. The analytical equations derived using flight dynamics and Base of Aircraft and Data (BADA) Total Energy Model (TEM) in this research gives insight into dependency of vertical profile of CDA on various factors like wind speed and gradient, weight, aircraft type and configuration, thrust settings, atmospheric factors (deviation from ISA (DISA), pressure and density of the air) and descent speed profile. Application of the derived equations to idle-thrust CDA gives an insight into sensitivity of its vertical profile to multiple factors. This suggests fixed geometric flight path angle (FPA) CDA has higher degree of predictability and lesser variability at the cost of non-idle and low thrust engine settings. However, with optimized design this impact can be overall minimized. The CDA simulations were performed using Future ATM Concept Evaluation Tool (FACET) based on radar-track and aircraft type data (BADA) of the real air-traffic to some of the busiest airports in the USA (ATL, SFO and New York Metroplex (JFK, EWR and LGA)). The statistical analysis of the vertical profiles of CDA shows 1) mean geometric FPAs derived from various simulated vertical profiles are consistently shallower than 3 ° glideslope angle and 2) high level of variability in vertical profiles of idle-thrust CDA even in absence of uncertainties in external factors. Analysis from operational feasibility perspective suggests that two key features of the performance based Flight Management System (FMS) i. e. required time of arrival (RTA) and geometric descent path would help in reduction of unpredictability associated with arrival time and vertical profile of aircraft guided by the FMS coupled with auto-pilot (AP) and auto-throttle (AT). The statistical analysis of the vertical profiles of CDA also suggests that for procedure design window type, `AT or above 2 ̆ 7 and `AT or below 2 ̆ 7 altitude and FPA constraints are more realistic and useful compared to obsolete `AT 2 ̆ 7 type altitude constraint...|$|R
40|$|The thesis at hand {{originates}} from German and Australian {{research projects}} {{supported by the}} German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the Erich-Becker-Foundation. It deals with {{the design of the}} socio-organisational interface between airport residents and airport managements. The “point of contact” that defines this interface is the issue of noise. <b>Noise</b> and its <b>abatement</b> are assessed differently {{in the view of the}} residents and the airport management. The thesis points out why it is important and beneficial for both to improve the interface, especially the issue of noise by diminishing residents’ noise annoyance. At the same time as annoyance is meant to be decreased, the residents’ contentment with noise management is meant to be increased. As noise annoyance is not only generated by acoustical factors such as noise level, an approach is chosen that also takes non-acoustic factors into account. Two of the most important non-acoustic factors are the accessibility and transparency of information and the possibility of participation. The intervention tool, the NoiseCall, facilitates and promotes these aspects. In a quasi-experimental field study at the airports Augsburg and Kassel-Calden, the NoiseCall has been installed as a complaint and information service to facilitate a moderated information flow between airport management and residents. The perceived control and the coping strategies of residents were meant to be enhanced, and consequently, annoyance to be reduced and contentment with the management increased. As a main result, the annoyance of Kassel residents, who used the NoiseCall, declined significantly. The contentment of this group increased, however below statistical significance. In Augsburg, no significant changes after the installation of the NoiseCall were detected. Annoyance correlated to a high degree with the fear of a loss in the value of the homes. Likewise, the contentment with the airport management is closely related to annoyance. In a second step, data from Dortmund and Sydney Airport were analysed to investigate possible personality differences that might explain why some annoyed residents call a noise line, whereas others do not. However, the results on anger expression of users and non-users are not totally consistent. Still, German users can be characterised by less suppression of anger. The NoiseCall as a tool to design the socio-organisational interface of residents and airport management is effective, if it is put into practice at an early point in time. According to the data at hand, it is effective at small-sized airports. The described correlations of annoyance with the different non-acoustic aspects once again stress the importance of their consideration. The results of the regression analyis support their influence on annoyance as well. Moreover, trust building measures to design and improve the interface of e. g. the system “airport” and “residents” have to match and meet the specific demands of the relationship between these. Concluding from the study results the NoiseCall seems to be just one possibility (e. g. for small airports with a good relation to its residents) of a design measure. Apparently, partly due to the different personalities of residents, a manifold approach should be followed: an internet platform, for example, to lodge a complaint might be more attractive for residents who prefer more anonymity, while public meetings might attracts those who prefer face-to-face communication...|$|R
