50|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} used for network connections. Patch cables {{are used for}} short distances in offices and wiring closets. Electrical connections using twisted pair or coaxial cable are used within a building. Optical fiber cable is used for long distances or for applications requiring high bandwidth or electrical isolation. Many installations use structured cabling practices to improve reliability and maintainability. In some home and industrial applications power lines are used as <b>network</b> <b>cabling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Threaded {{mounting}} holes in racks where {{the equipment is}} frequently changed are problematic because the threads can be damaged or the mounting screws can break off; both problems render the mounting hole unusable. Tapping large numbers of holes that may never be used is expensive; nonetheless tapped-hole racks are still in use, generally for hardware that rarely changes. Examples include telephone exchanges, <b>network</b> <b>cabling</b> panels, broadcast studios and some government and military applications.|$|E

50|$|Rollover cable (also {{known as}} a Yost cable) {{is a type of}} null-modem cable that is often used to connect a {{computer}} terminal to a router's console port. This cable is typically flat (and has a light blue color) to help distinguish it from other types of <b>network</b> <b>cabling.</b> It gets the name rollover because the pinouts on one end are reversed from the other, as if the wire had been rolled over and you were viewing it from the other side.|$|E
5000|$|More {{powerful}} cable testers {{can measure}} {{the properties of}} the cable relevant to signal transmission. These include the DC resistance of the cable, the losss of signal strength (attenuation) of a signal at one or more frequencies, and a measure of the isolation between multiple pairs of a multi-pair cable or crosstalk. While these instruments are several times the cost and complexity of basic continuity testers, these measurements may be required to [...] certify that a cable installation meets the technical standards required for its use, for example, in local area <b>network</b> <b>cabling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{relatively}} {{slow speed}} of AppleTalk allowed further reductions in cost. Instead of using RS-422's balanced transmit and receive circuits, the AppleTalk Personal <b>Network</b> <b>cabling</b> used a single common electrical ground, which limited speeds to about 500 kbit/s, but allowed one conductor to be removed. This meant that common three-conductor cables {{could be used}} for wiring. Additionally, the adaptors were designed to be [...] "self-terminating", meaning that nodes {{at the end of the}} network could simply leave their last connector unconnected. There was no need for the wires to be connected back together into a loop, nor the need for hubs or other devices.|$|E
