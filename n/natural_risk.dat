40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} {{a conceptual framework}} for addressing temporal variation in <b>natural</b> <b>risk.</b> Numerous former <b>natural</b> <b>risk</b> analyses and investigations have demonstrated that time and related changes have a crucial influence on risk. For natural hazards, time becomes a factor {{for a number of}} reasons. Using the example of landslides to illustrate this point, it is shown that: 1. landslide history is important in determining probability of occurrence, 2. the significance of catchment variables in explaining landslide susceptibility is dependent on the time scale chosen, 3. the observer's perception of the geosystem's state changes with different time spans, and 4. the system's sensitivity varies with time. Natural hazards are not isolated events but complex features that are connected with the social system. Similarly, elements at risk and their vulnerability are highly dynamic through time, an aspect that is not sufficiently acknowledged in research. Since <b>natural</b> <b>risk</b> is an amalgam of hazard and vulnerability, its temporal behaviour has to be considered as well. Identifying these changes and their underlying processes contributes {{to a better understanding of}} <b>natural</b> <b>risk</b> today and in the future. However, no dynamic models for natural risks are currently available. Dynamic behaviour of factors affecting risk is likely to create increasing connectivity and complexity. This demands a broad approach to <b>natural</b> <b>risk,</b> since the concept of risk encapsulates aspects of many disciplines and has suffered from single-discipline approaches in the past. In New Zealand, dramatic environmental and social change has occurred in a relatively short period of time, graphically demonstrating the temporal variability of the geosystem and the social system. To understand these changes and subsequent interactions between both systems, a holistic perspective is needed. This contribution reviews available frameworks, demonstrates the need for further concepts, and gives research perspectives on a New Zealand example...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the results of {{experiments}} where participants choose between entrepreneurship and an outside option. Entrepreneurs enter a market and then make investment decisions to capture value. Payoffs depend on both strategic risk (i. e. the investments of other entrepreneurs) and <b>natural</b> <b>risk</b> (i. e. luck). Absent <b>natural</b> <b>risk,</b> participants endogenously sort themselves into entrepreneurial and safe types, and returns from the two paths converge. Adding <b>natural</b> <b>risk</b> fundamentally changes these conclusions: Here we observe excessive entry and excessive investment so that entrepreneurs earn systematically less than the outside option. These payoff differences persist even after many repetitions of the task. With a risky outside option, entry further increases and about one-third of entrepreneurs adopt a passive strategy, investing little or nothing. Finally, we examine an environment where an individual must become an entrepreneur but chooses the stakes over which she will compete. Due to under-entry and under-investment in the high stakes setting, the returns gap grows to over 15 percentage points.

40|$|Choosing {{a proper}} risk measure {{is of great}} {{regulatory}} importance, as ex-emplified in Basel Accord that uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) in combination with scenario analysis as a preferred risk measure. The main motivation of this pa-per is to investigate whether VaR, in combination with scenario analysis, is a good risk measure for external regulation. While many risk measures may be suitable for internal management, we argue that risk measures used for external regulation should have robustness with respect to modeling assumptions and data. We propose new data-based risk measures called <b>natural</b> <b>risk</b> statistics that are characterized by {{a new set of}} axioms based on the comonotonicity from decision theory. <b>Natural</b> <b>risk</b> statistics include VaR as a special case and there-fore provide a theoretical basis for using VaR along with scenario analysis as a robust risk measure for the purpose of external, regulatory risk measurement...|$|E

These payoff differences persist even after many repetitions of the task. When the outside option becomes risky, we observe a “democratization” of entrepreneurship—the average individual enters and exits several times {{over the course of the}} experiment. Exit is hastened by unlucky outcomes: When realized payoffs fall below expected payoffs, subjects are more likely to exit the market. On the other hand, skill at the investment task plays little role in determining the likelihood of entrepreneurship. Finally, we examine an environment where an individual must become an entrepreneur but chooses the stakes over which she will compete. Here, we observe under-entry and under-investment in the high-stakes market, while the opposite is true in the low stakes setting. As a result, returns to entrepreneurship are positive under high stakes and negative under low stakes, even after subjects have considerable experience at the task...|$|E
