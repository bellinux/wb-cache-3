House has made a comment about the relationship ("I'm gay!...Oh that's <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> meant.

[...] Barbara Barnett said that [...] "House is the needy one in the relationship, and Wilson the doormat" [...] Verne Gay of Newsday described House's love for Wilson as [...] "touching and genuine". However, Robert Sean Leonard compared the relationship between the two to that of Cesar Millan and his Pit Bull, while Hugh Laurie said that it's [...] "not just buddydom". The two characters appeared on the October 13, 2008, cover of TV Guide.|$|E

The player seeks to recover four lost artifacts: the Rod of Osiris, the Holy Grail, the Philosopher's Stone, and the Ark of the Covenant. According to Horse, [...] "The relics you're searching for are <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think they are". The first world, Binah, includes aspects of Arthurian legend, including Morgan Le Fey and the Knights Templar, as well as Stonehenge. The second, Chesed, features Aztec ruins and a submarine interior. The third, Din, centers around an underground transit system, a steampunk carnival, and a mechanical maze. The final world, Chokmah, takes place outside Area 51.|$|E

500|$|Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole was keen to win {{his first}} trophy in the final: [...] "We don't feel under any great pressure, but we do feel excited about the {{possibility}} of winning our first trophy, we've just been imagining {{what it would be like}} to lift the trophy, who's going where in the line if we win it, and how we'll run round Cardiff with it." [...] Teammate Frank Lampard was also keen {{to win his}} first trophy: [...] "If you haven't won anything, a runners-up medal is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want at all." [...] He also stated that Chelsea manager José Mourinho's desire to win had been rubbing off on the players: [...] "He actually gets angrier with each one, so every time we lose it's the worst I've seen him, he's a winner, though, that's what you expect, and that's the attitude that's needed at Chelsea these days." ...|$|E
500|$|Time Out {{gave the}} film a mostly {{positive}} review, writing, [...] "While Django remains the erratic Corbucci's best picture, this slightly later spaghetti Western does well by an inventive set-up [...] between the bullets there's engaging {{stuff from the}} two stars and an unmistakable chill in the air". Film critic Leonard Maltin praised the film, awarding it 3 1/2 {{out of a possible}} 4 stars. In his review he wrote that The Great Silence is a [...] "brutal, bleakly beautiful spaghetti Western filmed on stark locations in the Dolomites, {{with one of the most}} uncompromising and unforgettable finales ever filmed". Kyle Anderson of Nerdist News described the film as Corbucci's [...] "most artful and daring" [...] Western, one that [...] "pushes the genre to new levels and creates a story unlike anything people were used to, even though it's likely more historically accurate". He concluded his review by stating that [...] "If you're looking for a good time on a Saturday night, I'd say this movie is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want, but if you're looking for a dark, violent, thoughtful, and well-made film, look no further".|$|E

She added, [...] "It's the one I made in-between taking time out and having a baby and starting mine". When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it was kind of an interesting situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really thought I {{was going to be able}} to go in there and get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might think that's great because it's <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do, but to me I'm really bored of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time when everyone else did.|$|E

2500|$|Still {{remembered in}} Poland as the renowned punk rocker Walek Dzedzej, Cyril Danicki {{traveled}} to the country of his birth for one final visit.

2500|$|Due to cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel's use of de-focussing {{and soft}} wipes {{in the digital}} grade, Warner Bros. asked {{director}} David Yates to add more colours to the film.

[...] After five minutes of watching the film, the studio were pleased with the changes.

The palette and lighting was heavily inspired by the Dutch painter Rembrandt.

2500|$|... "Beware of Darkness" [...] is a ballad {{containing}} dense imagery. The song marks {{a return}} to the spiritual concerns of Harrison's songs with the Beatles such as [...] "Within You Without You". The lyrics of [...] "Beware of Darkness" [...] reflect the philosophy of the Radha Krishna Temple, with which Harrison was involved, in which spiritual concerns must always override material things. In the verses, the listener is warned against various influences that may corrupt him or her. Among the potential corrupting influences are con men ("soft shoe shufflers"), politicians ("greedy leaders") and pop idols of little substance ("falling swingers"). In addition, the lyrics warn against negative thoughts ("thoughts that linger"), since these corrupting influences and negative thoughts can lead to maya, or illusion, which distracts people from the true purpose of life. The middle eight delivers the message that this [...] "can hurt you", and that [...] "that is <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are here for." ...|$|E
