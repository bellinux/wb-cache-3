5|$|In {{an effort}} to cut Grant's supply line, Confederates in Louisiana under Major General John G. Walker {{attacked}} Milliken's Bend up the Mississippi on June 7. This was mainly defended by recently enlisted United States Colored Troops. Despite having inferior weaponry, they fought bravely and finally repulsed the Confederates with help from gunboats, although at horrible cost; the defenders lost 652 to the Confederate 185. The loss at Milliken's Bend left the Confederates with <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> relief but from the cautious Johnston.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{falls into}} the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; {{the souls of the}} Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by the spirit of Athena, who had {{previously}} sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not see before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades, which releases the souls of the Underworld. When he considers searching for the soul of Calliope, Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia. There he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.|$|E

25|$|To Leo the Great, Mariology is {{determined}} by Christology. If Christ were divine only, everything about him would be divine. Only his divinity would have been crucified, buried and resurrected. Mary would only be the mother of God, and Christians would have <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> their own resurrection.

The Pandavas accumulated seven Akshauhinis army {{with the help of}} their allies. Each of these divisions were led by Drupada, Virata, Dhrishtadyumna, Shikhandi, Satyaki, Chekitana and Bhima. After consulting his commanders, the Pandavas appointed Dhrishtadyumna as the supreme commander of the Pandava army. Mahabharata says that kingdoms from all over ancient India supplied troops or provided logistic support on the Pandava side. Some of these were: Kekaya, Pandya, Cholas, Magadha, and many more.|$|E

In five minutes the thing was settled. If I would undertake the management of it, it was to be started and five hundred pound was put down on the spot; it was soon found there was a little press and some types to be bought. I promised I would write and would exercise a general superintendence over the matter... The first number appeared three weeks after the conversation referred to.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} Vital Signs helped others {{to follow their}} suit, and the rock music in the country skyrocketed {{for the first time}} in the history of the country. In a time when there was <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> the {{industry}} to survive, rock/pop music bands notably and much quickly filled the gap that pop music industry had left. According to the Western observers and cultural critics, the rock music bands in the country brought the significant shift of country's transformation into modernism during the 1990s. With the rise of Vital Signs and later, Junoon and others, the rock music, exploded in the 1980s and 1990s, became a vehicle for expressing patriotic nationalist spirit in Pakistan.|$|E

At the council of Lords held by James, Rochester defended the petition and declared that he saw <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> king and country except through a Parliament.

In the darkness, the remaining team members are ambushed by shooters from above, and almost completely wiped out. Prior to the gunfight, Lt.

25|$|Liu Xiu {{carried out}} his action, {{and when he}} {{returned}} to Kunyang, he began harassing the sieging Xin forces from the outside. Wang Yi and Wang Xun, annoyed, led 10,000 men to attack Liu Xiu and ordered the rest of their troops not to move from their siege locations. Once they engaged in battle, however, after minor losses, the other units were hesitant to assist them, and Liu Xiu killed Wang Xun in battle. Once that happened, the Han forces inside Kunyang burst out of the city and attacked the other Xin units, and the much larger Xin forces suffered a total collapse. The soldiers largely deserted and went home, unable to be gathered again. Wang Yi had to withdraw with only several thousand men back to Luoyang. This was a major blow to Xin, psychologically; after this point on, there would be <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> it.|$|E

Friedhelm Mennekes {{writes that}} in the victim's scream, [...] "there {{is not even a}} lament of being forsaken by God. A god does not emerge for the figure jerking in mortal anguish in the painting". Sharpe identifies the tiny oblivious stick-figure passersby as the element that mostly removes the work from [...] "a straightforward recapitulation of ancient religious iconography and into postwar modernity".|$|E
