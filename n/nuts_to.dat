5|$|Purvis {{was born}} on July 4, 1857, into a family of Scottish descent. His parents were Robert Raaf Purvis and Annie Silburn Marshall. His {{paternal}} grandfather, William Purvis, {{who worked as a}} trader and ship captain, had settled in the Dutch East Indies in the 1810s while it was still part of the British Empire. The family lived in many places including Dutch East Indies, Brussels, and London. Educated at Cheltenham College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Edward William Purvis served as a sub-lieutenant of the 70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot in Bengal, where he learned Hindi, and later as a sub-lieutenant for the 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot in Chatham, Kent. Around 1879 he resigned his British Army post and traveled to the Hawaiian Islands, where his father and older brother Robert William Theodore Purvis had already settled, having arrived on December13, 1877; his brother Theodore had started a sugar plantation business on the island of Kauai. A distant cousin of theirs was William Herbert Purvis, known for introducing macadamia <b>nuts</b> <b>to</b> Hawaii.|$|E

However, Brendan is cornered by a hungry pack of wolves. He is saved by Aisling, the forest spirit {{from the beginning of}} the film. Although at first suspicious of Brendan's presence, Aisling slowly comes to accept him after he reveals his intentions of helping to create the book.|$|E
25|$|Eastern gray {{squirrels}} have a {{high enough}} tolerance for humans to inhabit residential neighborhoods and raid bird feeders for millet, corn, and sunflower seeds. Some people who feed and watch birds for entertainment also intentionally feed seeds and <b>nuts</b> <b>to</b> the squirrels for the same reason. The squirrels also raid gardens for tomatoes, corn, strawberries, and other garden crops. Sometimes they eat the tomato seeds and discard the rest. On very rare occasions, when their usual food sources are scarce, eastern gray squirrels also prey upon insects, frogs, small rodents including other squirrels, and small birds, their eggs, and young. They also gnaw on bones, antlers, and turtle shells – likely {{as a source of}} minerals scarce in their normal diet.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese macaque is {{omnivorous}} {{and eats}} {{a variety of}} foods. Over 213 species of plants are included on the macaque's diet. It also eats insects, bark, and soil. On Yakushima Island, fruit, mature leaves, and fallen seeds are primarily eaten. The macaque also eats fungi, ferns, invertebrates, {{and other parts of}} plants. In addition, on Yakushima, their diets vary seasonally with fruits being eaten in the summer and herbs being eaten in the winter. Further north, macaques mostly eat foods such as fruit and <b>nuts</b> <b>to</b> store fat for the winter, when food is scarce. On the northern island of Kinkazan, macaques mostly eat fallen seeds, herbs, young leaves, and fruits. When preferred food items are not available, macaques dig up underground plant parts (roots or rhizomes) or eat soil and fish.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, when Jean {{announced}} {{the title of}} the episode at the Television Critics Association summer tour, several news outlets suspected that Krusty the Clown would be killed off. Jean later told of his surprise at this theory, saying [...] "I was like, 'What? [...] "In the dumps" [...] doesn't mean you're dead. It means you're sad.' I thought it was so obvious. I would be <b>nuts</b> <b>to</b> kill Krusty. Everybody loves that character". [...] He said of the episode, [...] "It turned out bigger than we {{thought it was going to}} be.

500|$|... "Pour Me", {{the last}} soft {{song on the}} album, is a dark ballad that has been often {{compared}} to Eminem's [...] "Stan". Johnny3Tears stated that, [...] "We were messing around with chord progressions and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it. It's melodic and poppy sounding. We're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes drink too much. It's one of those basic every day things that people go through but they don't know how to voice it or others around them don't know to voice it. It's almost like you're looked down upon, but no one actually talks about it." [...] "Tendencies", which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album, is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder. Johnny3Tears said, [...] "When we wrote Tendencies, I {{wanted to make a}} song that kids would just go <b>nuts</b> <b>to</b> when we played it. Kids start moshpits at our shows. Not every song we have is the best mosh song, so I wanted to make a song kids could go crazy for." ...|$|E

2500|$|The corselet, {{also known}} as a breastplate, is an oval or {{rectangular}} collar-piece resting on the shoulders, chest and back, to support the helmet and seal it to the suit, usually made from copper and brass, but occasionally steel. The helmet is usually connected to the suit by placing the holes around the rubberised collar of the suit over bolts along the rim of the corselet, and then clamping the brass straps known as brailes against the collar with wing <b>nuts</b> <b>to</b> press the rubber against the metal of the corselet rim to make a [...] water-tight seal.

2500|$|Milt Schornack joined Royal Pontiac {{and helped}} improve the {{performance}} enhancement package. The {{components of the}} kit varied, but generally included parts to modify the spark advance of the distributor, limiting spark advance to 34–36° at no more than 3,000rpm (advancing the timing at high rpm for increased power), a thinner copper head gasket to raise compression to about 11.23:1, special intake manifold gaskets to block the heat riser to the carburetor (keeping it cooler), larger carburetor jets, and locking rocker <b>nuts</b> <b>to</b> hold the hydraulic valve lifters at their maximum point of adjustment, allowing the engine to rev higher without [...] "floating" [...] the valves. Properly installed, the kit could add between 30 and 50 horsepower (20–40kW), although it required high-octane superpremium gasoline of over 100 octane to avoid spark knock with the higher compression and advanced timing. Adhesive [...] "Royal Bobcats" [...] stickers were also included.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2011, Bring Me the Horizon {{embarked}} on a European tour, starting in the United Kingdom.

The tour, however, was not without its hindrances. On 28 April, Matt Nicholls broke his arm whilst playing football with members of Bring Me the Horizon, Parkway Drive and Architects. Instead of cancelling the tour, Architects' drummer Dan Searle filled in as the drummer, but this meant that Bring Me the Horizon's setlist was halved in length. The tour was extended with a North American leg from 13 August to 4 October, retaining Parkway Drive and Architects and adding Deez <b>Nuts</b> <b>to</b> the line up.
