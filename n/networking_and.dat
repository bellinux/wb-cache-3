5|$|Titan uses Jaguar's 200 cabinets, {{covering}} 404 square meters (4,352 ft2), with replaced internals and upgraded networking. Reusing Jaguar's {{power and}} cooling systems saved approximately $20 million. Power is provided to each cabinet at three-phase 480 V. This requires thinner cables than the US standard 208 V, saving $1 million in copper. At its peak, Titan draws 8.2 MW, 1.2 MW more than Jaguar, but runs almost {{ten times as}} fast in terms of floating point calculations. In {{the event of a}} power failure, carbon fiber flywheel power storage can keep the <b>networking</b> <b>and</b> storage infrastructure running for up to 16 seconds. After 2 seconds without power, diesel generators fire up, taking approximately 7 seconds to reach full power. They can provide power indefinitely. The generators are designed only to keep the <b>networking</b> <b>and</b> storage components powered so that a reboot is much quicker; the generators are not capable of powering the processing infrastructure.|$|E
