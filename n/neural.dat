5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third week of development, the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the <b>neural</b> plate. By the fourth week of development the <b>neural</b> plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end. These swellings represent {{the beginning}}s of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. <b>Neural</b> crest cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the lateral edges of the plate at the <b>neural</b> folds. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the <b>neural</b> plate folds and closes to form the <b>neural</b> tube, bringing together the <b>neural</b> crest cells at the <b>neural</b> crest. The <b>neural</b> crest runs the length of the tube with cranial <b>neural</b> crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal <b>neural</b> crest cells at the tail. Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (head to tail) wave inside the tube. Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|The {{developing}} forebrain {{surrounds the}} <b>neural</b> cord. As the forebrain develops, the <b>neural</b> cord within {{it becomes a}} ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a choroid plexus develops, producing and releasing CSF. The CSF quickly fills the <b>neural</b> canal. Arachnoid villi are formed around the 35th week of development, with aracnhoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} the Acrocanthosaurus atokensis holotype shows light exostotic {{material}} on the squamosal. The <b>neural</b> spine of the eleventh vertebra was fractured and healed while the <b>neural</b> spine of its third tail vertebra had an unusual hook-like structure.|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of <b>neural</b> {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the <b>neural</b> plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The <b>neural</b> plate folds inward to form the <b>neural</b> groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the <b>neural</b> tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
5|$|The methodological {{breakthroughs}} of the neurosciences, {{in particular}} the introduction of high-tech neuroimaging procedures, has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly ambitious research programs: {{one of the main}} goals is to describe and comprehend the <b>neural</b> processes which correspond to mental functions (see: <b>neural</b> correlate). Several groups are inspired by these advances.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neural</b> mapping {{between two}} <b>neural</b> maps are compact or dense: Each neuron of one <b>neural</b> map is {{interconnected}} with (nearly) each neuron {{of the other}} <b>neural</b> map (many-to-many-connection, see artificial <b>neural</b> networks). Because of this density criterion for <b>neural</b> mappings, <b>neural</b> maps which are interconnected by a <b>neural</b> mapping are not far apart from each other.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>neural</b> mappings <b>neural</b> pathways can connect <b>neural</b> maps which are far apart (e.g. in different cortical lobes, see cerebral cortex). From the functional or modeling viewpoint, <b>neural</b> pathways mainly forward information without processing this information. A <b>neural</b> pathway {{in comparison to}} a <b>neural</b> mapping need much less <b>neural</b> connections. A <b>neural</b> pathway can be modelled by using a one-to-one connection of the neurons of both <b>neural</b> maps (see topographic mapping and see somatotopic arrangement).|$|E
25|$|A <b>neural</b> {{representation}} {{within an}} artificial <b>neural</b> network is a temporarily activated (<b>neural)</b> state {{within a specific}} <b>neural</b> map. Each <b>neural</b> state is represented by a specific <b>neural</b> activation pattern. This activation pattern changes during speech processing (e.g. from syllable to syllable).|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the <b>neural</b> plate starts when dorsal mesoderm signals ectodermal cells above it to lengthen into columnar <b>neural</b> plate cells. This different shape distinguishes {{the cells of the}} presumptive <b>neural</b> plate from other pre-epidermal cells. If the <b>neural</b> plate is separated by itself, it will still develop to make a thinner plate but will not form a <b>neural</b> tube. If the region containing presumptive epidermis and <b>neural</b> plate tissue is isolated, small <b>neural</b> folds will form. Elongation that occurs throughout the {{formation of}} the <b>neural</b> plate and closure of the <b>neural</b> tube is vital; the closing areas of the <b>neural</b> tube are seen to have very increased elongation activity in the midline compared to already closed areas when the plate was beginning to shape itself into a tube.|$|E
25|$|Example: In {{the case}} of two <b>neural</b> maps, each {{comprising}} 1,000 model neurons, a <b>neural</b> mapping needs up to 1,000,000 <b>neural</b> connections (many-to-many-connection), while only 1,000 connections are needed in {{the case of}} a <b>neural</b> pathway connection.|$|E
25|$|A <b>neural</b> mapping connects two {{cortical}} <b>neural</b> maps. <b>Neural</b> mappings (in {{contrast to}} <b>neural</b> pathways) store training information by adjusting their <b>neural</b> link weights (see artificial neuron, artificial <b>neural</b> networks). <b>Neural</b> mappings {{are capable of}} generating or activating a distributed representation (see above) of a sensory or motor state within a sensory or motor map from a punctual or local activation within the other map (see for example the synaptic projection from speech sound map to motor map, to auditory target region map, or to somatosensory target region map in the DIVA model, explained below; or see for example the <b>neural</b> mapping from phonetic map to auditory state map and motor plan state map in the ACT model, explained below and Fig. 3).|$|E
25|$|<b>Neural</b> {{engineering}} (also {{known as}} neuroengineering) is a discipline that uses engineering techniques to understand, repair, replace, or enhance <b>neural</b> systems. <b>Neural</b> engineers are uniquely qualified to solve design {{problems at the}} interface of living <b>neural</b> tissue and non-living constructs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neural</b> plate border specifiers are induced {{as a set}} of {{transcription}} factors. Distalless-5, PAX3 and PAX7 {{prevent the}} border region from becoming either <b>neural</b> plate or epidermis. These induce a second set of transcription factors called <b>neural</b> crest specifiers, which cause cells to become <b>neural</b> crest cells.|$|E
25|$|Signaling {{proteins}} {{are also}} important in <b>neural</b> plate development, and aid in differentiating the tissue destined to become the <b>neural</b> plate. Examples of such proteins include bone morphogenetic proteins and cadherins. Expression of these proteins is essential to <b>neural</b> plate folding and subsequent <b>neural</b> tube formation.|$|E

25|$|After {{fusion of}} the <b>neural</b> fold {{to create the}} <b>neural</b> tube, cells {{originally}} located in the <b>neural</b> plate border become <b>neural</b> crest cells. For migration to begin, <b>neural</b> crest cells must undergo a process called delamination that involves a full or partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Delamination {{is defined as the}} separation of tissue into different populations, in this case <b>neural</b> crest cells separating from the surrounding tissue. Conversely, EMT is a series of events coordinating a change from an epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype. For example, delamination in chick embryos is triggered by a BMP/Wnt cascade that induces the expression of EMT promoting transcription factors such as SNAI2 and FoxD3. Although all <b>neural</b> crest cells undergo EMT, the timing of delamination occurs at different stages in different organisms: in Xenopus laevis embryos there is a massive delamination that occurs when the <b>neural</b> plate is not entirely fused, whereas delamination in the chick embryo occurs during fusion of the <b>neural</b> fold.|$|E
25|$|As an {{application}} of the free-choice paradigm, the study How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome (2009) indicates that after making a choice, <b>neural</b> activity in the striatum changes to reflect the person's new evaluation of the choice-object; <b>neural</b> activity increased if the object was chosen, <b>neural</b> activity decreased if the object was rejected. Moreover, studies such as The <b>Neural</b> Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2010) and How Choice Modifies Preference: <b>Neural</b> Correlates of Choice Justification (2011) confirm the <b>neural</b> bases of the psychology of cognitive dissonance.|$|E
25|$|Neurocomputational speech {{processing}} is {{speech processing}} by artificial <b>neural</b> networks. <b>Neural</b> maps, mappings and pathways as described below, are model structures, i.e. important structures within artificial <b>neural</b> networks.|$|E
25|$|Low pSMAD 1, 5, 8 levels allow {{a greater}} {{mobility}} at the median hinge point than in lateral <b>neural</b> plate cells. This flexibility {{allows for the}} pivoting and hinging that allows the buckling and lifting of the <b>neural</b> plate when formatting the <b>neural</b> tube. The <b>neural</b> plate has to be rigid enough for morphogenic movements to occur while being flexible enough to undergo shape and position changes for the transformation to the <b>neural</b> tube.|$|E
25|$|The bending of the <b>neural</b> plate {{involves}} {{the formation of}} hinges, where the <b>neural</b> plate is connected to surrounding tissues. The midline of the <b>neural</b> plate is referred to the median hinge point (MHP). Cells in this area, known as medial hinge point cells because of their involvement with this structure, are stabilized and connected to the notochord. They are derived from {{the area of the}} <b>neural</b> plate anterior to primitive knot. The notochord will begin the shape changes in MHP cells. These cells will decrease in height and become wedge-shaped. Another type of hinge point occurs dorsal-laterally, referred to as dorsal-lateral hinge point (DLHP). These regions furrow and change shape {{in the same way as}} MHP cells do before connecting together to form the <b>neural</b> tube. It was seen in an experiment that without the notochord, the MHP characteristics did not develop correctly, so the <b>neural</b> plate and <b>neural</b> tube formation did not happen properly. The communication between the <b>neural</b> plate and the notochord is important for the future induction and formation of the <b>neural</b> tube.|$|E
25|$|During {{the stage}} of <b>neural</b> plate {{formation}} the embryo consists of three cell layers: the ectoderm that eventually forms the skin and <b>neural</b> tissues, the mesoderm that forms muscle and bone, and the endoderm that will form the cells lining the digestive and respiratory tracts. The progenitor cells {{that make up the}} precursors to <b>neural</b> tissues in the <b>neural</b> plate are called neuroepithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{merging of}} the <b>neural</b> folds {{gives rise to}} many {{structures}} including: the <b>neural</b> tube (the precursor to the central nervous system), <b>neural</b> crest cells(which {{give rise to a}} variety of diverse mesenchymal cells), and to the true epidermal layer. The <b>neural</b> fold is an extremely important structure in that this mechanism is needed to produce these diverse kinds of cells in the right places.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} stages of <b>neural</b> plate and <b>neural</b> tube formation: formation, bending, convergence, and closure.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore {{the link}} weights of the {{connections}} within a <b>neural</b> mapping are adjusted during training, while the <b>neural</b> {{connections in the}} case of a <b>neural</b> pathway need not to be trained (each connection is maximal exhibitory).|$|E
25|$|<b>Neural</b> {{oscillations}} {{are observed}} throughout {{the central nervous}} system at all levels, and include spike trains, local field potentials and large-scale oscillations which can be measured by electroencephalography (EEG). In general, oscillations can be characterized by their frequency, amplitude and phase. These signal properties can be extracted from <b>neural</b> recordings using time-frequency analysis. In large-scale oscillations, amplitude changes are considered to result from changes in synchronization within a <b>neural</b> ensemble, also referred to as local synchronization. In addition to local synchronization, oscillatory activity of distant <b>neural</b> structures (single neurons or <b>neural</b> ensembles) can synchronize. <b>Neural</b> oscillations and synchronization have been linked to many cognitive functions such as information transfer, perception, motor control and memory.|$|E
25|$|SHH {{emanates from}} the {{notochord}} and ventral floor plate {{of the developing}} <b>neural</b> tube to create a concentration gradient that spans the dorso-ventral axis. Higher concentrations of the SHH ligand {{are found in the}} most ventral aspects of the <b>neural</b> tube and notochord, while lower concentrations are found in the more dorsal regions of the <b>neural</b> tube. The SHH concentration gradient has been visualized in the <b>neural</b> tube of mice engineered to express a SHH::GFP fusion protein to show this graded distribution of SHH during the time of ventral <b>neural</b> tube patterning.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 Sony {{patented}} a <b>neural</b> interface system allowing {{radio waves}} to affect signals in the <b>neural</b> cortex.|$|E
25|$|In primary neurulation, {{the layer}} of {{ectoderm}} divides into three sets of cells: the <b>neural</b> tube (future brain and spinal cord), epidermis (skin), and <b>neural</b> crest cells (connects epidermis and <b>neural</b> tube and will migrate to make neurons, glia, and skin cell pigmentation).|$|E
25|$|The <b>neural</b> tube {{itself is}} the initial groundwork of the {{vertebrate}} CNS, and the floor plate is a specialized structure and {{is located at the}} ventral midpoint of the <b>neural</b> tube. Evidence supporting the notochord as the signaling center comes from studies in which a second notochord is implanted near a <b>neural</b> tube in vivo, leading to the formation of an ectopic floor plate within the <b>neural</b> tube.|$|E
25|$|The {{structures}} of the ventricular system are embryologically derived from the <b>neural</b> canal, {{the centre of the}} <b>neural</b> tube.|$|E
25|$|There are quantum analogues or generalisations of {{classical}} <b>neural</b> nets which {{are known as}} quantum <b>neural</b> networks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neural</b> network {{research}} stagnated after {{machine learning}} research by Minsky and Papert (1969), who discovered two key {{issues with the}} computational machines that processed <b>neural</b> networks. The first was that basic perceptrons were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. The second was that computers didn't have enough processing power to effectively handle the work required by large <b>neural</b> networks. <b>Neural</b> network research slowed until computers achieved far greater processing power.|$|E
25|$|Differentiable <b>neural</b> {{computers}} (DNC) are an NTM extension. They out-performed <b>neural</b> Turing machines, long {{short-term memory}} systems and memory networks on sequence-processing tasks.|$|E
25|$|The {{migration}} of <b>neural</b> crest cells involves a highly coordinated cascade {{of events that}} begins with closure of the dorsal <b>neural</b> tube.|$|E
25|$|Neocognitron, a {{hierarchical}} multilayered <b>neural</b> network proposed by Professor Kunihiko Fukushima in 1987, {{is one of}} the first Deep Learning <b>Neural</b> Networks models.|$|E
25|$|In chicken embryos, {{while the}} <b>neural</b> plate {{increases}} {{in length and}} decreases in apical width, {{the thickness of the}} plate does not change drastically. As the <b>neural</b> plate progresses through the Hamburger-Hamilton stages, the plate thickens until about HH6-7, when the <b>neural</b> plate begins to fold into tube form. The apical surface area increases during neurulation, unlike amphibian embryos. In mouse embryos, there is a large convex-shaped curve to each side of the middle of the plate. This curve has to be reversed as the plate rolls together to form the <b>neural</b> tube.|$|E
