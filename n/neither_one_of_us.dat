He won the August 15, 2006, Republican primary handily, defeating state senator Bob Beers and Lieutenant Governor Lorraine Hunt. In the general election (described as [...] "most contentious, ugly and negative in history") he faced Democratic nominee Dina Titus, who was the Minority Leader in the Nevada State Senate. Gibbons received 278,984 votes to Titus's 255,675. Titus won Clark County, Nevada's most populous, but Gibbons won every other county. Gibbons called Titus [...] "an admirable opponent", although Titus declined to echo his sentiments, saying [...] "We disagree on basic policies, and <b>neither</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> is going to change our minds for the other".|$|E

At this, fearing evil news for the Hajji, I would have restrained him, but he said: 'We be both Great <b>Ones.</b> <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will fail.' Our Sahib looked up to invite the Hajji to approach before he opened the letter, but the Hajji stood off till our Sahib had well opened and well read the letter. Then the Hajji said: 'Is it permitted to say farewell?' Our Sahib stabbed the letter on the file with a deep and joyful breath and cried a welcome. The Hajji said: 'I go to my own place,' and he loosed from his neck a chained heart of ambergris set in soft gold and held it forth. Our Sahib snatched it swiftly in the closed fist, down turned, and said 'If thy name be written hereon, it is needless, for a name is already engraved on my heart.' The Hajji said: 'And on mine also is a name engraved; {{but there is no}} name on the amulet.' The Hajji stooped to our Sahib's feet, but our Sahib raised and embraced him, and the Hajji covered his mouth with his shoulder-cloth, because it worked, and so he went away." ...|$|R

60|$|At {{the first}} {{we had a}} great deal to say, and thought {{ourselves}} pretty witty; and I was at a little pains to be the beau, and she (I believe) to play the young lady of experience. But soon we grew plainer with each other. I laid aside my high, clipped English (what little there was of it) and forgot to make my Edinburgh bows and scrapes; she, upon her side, fell into a sort of kind familiarity; and we dwelt together like those of the same household, only (upon my side) with a more deep emotion. About the same time, the bottom seemed to fall out of our conversation, and <b>neither</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> the less pleased. Whiles she would tell me old wives' tales, of which she had a wonderful variety, many of them from my friend red-headed Neil. She told them very pretty, and they were pretty enough childish tales; but the pleasure to myself was in the sound of her voice, and the thought that she was telling and I was listening. Whiles, again, we would sit entirely silent, not communicating even with a look, and tasting pleasure enough in the sweetness of that neighbourhood. I speak here only for myself. Of what was in the maid's mind I am not very sure that ever I asked myself; and what was in my own I was afraid to consider. I need make no secret of it now, either to myself or to the reader: I was fallen totally in love. She came between me and the sun. She had grown suddenly taller, as I say, but with a wholesome growth; she seemed all health, and lightness, and brave spirits; and I thought she walked like a young deer, and stood like a birch upon the mountains. It was enough for me to sit near by her on the deck; and I declare I scarce spent two thoughts upon the future, and was so well content with what I then enjoyed that I was never at the pains to imagine any further step; unless perhaps that I would be sometimes tempted to take her hand in mine and hold it there. But I was too like a miser of what joys I had, and would venture nothing on a hazard.|$|E
60|$|Every man, however brief or inglorious {{may have}} been his academical career, must {{remember}} with kindness and tenderness the old university comrades and days. The young man's life is just beginning: the boy's leading-strings are cut, and {{he has all the}} novel delights and dignities of freedom. He has no idea of cares yet, or of bad health, or of roguery, or poverty, or to-morrow's disappointment. The play has not been acted so often as to make him tired. Though the after drink, as we mechanically go on repeating it, is stale and bitter, how pure and brilliant was that first sparkling draught of pleasure!--How the boy rushes at the cup, and with what a wild eagerness he drains it! But old epicures who are cut off from the delights of the table, and are restricted to a poached egg and a glass of water, like to see people with good appetites; and, as {{the next best thing to}} being amused at a pantomime one's-self is to see one's children enjoy it, I hope there may be no degree of age or experience to which mortal may attain, when he shall become such a glum philosopher as not to be pleased by the sight of happy youth. Coming back a few weeks since from a brief visit to the old University of Oxbridge, where my friend Mr. Arthur Pendennis passed some period of his life, I made the journey in the railroad by the side of a young fellow at present a student of Saint Boniface. He had got an exeat somehow, and was bent on a day's lark in London: he never stopped rattling and talking from the commencement of the journey until its close (which was a great deal too soon for me, for I never was tired of listening to the honest young fellow's jokes and cheery laughter); and when we arrived at the terminus nothing would satisfy him but a hansom cab, so that he might get into town the quicker, and plunge into the pleasures awaiting him there. Away the young lad went whirling, with joy lighting up his honest face; and as for the reader's humble servant, having but a small carpet-bag, I got up on the outside of the omnibus, and sate there very contentedly between a Jew-pedlar smoking bad cigars, and a gentleman's servant taking care of a poodle-dog, until we got our fated complement of passengers and boxes, when the coachman drove leisurely away. We weren't in a hurry to get to town. <b>Neither</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> was particularly eager about rushing into that near smoking Babylon, or thought of dining at the Club that night, or dancing at the Casino. Yet a few years more, and my young friend of the railroad will be not a whit more eager.|$|E

[...] Where had I got about Captain Dunlevy? Oh yes, I remember. [...] Well, when the railroads began {{to run away from}} the steamboats, [...] Taking the {{carrying}} trade in {{the very edge of the}} water, [...] It was all up with the old flush times, and Captain Dunlevy [...] Had to climb down with the rest of us pilots till he was only [...] Captain the same as any and every pilot is captain, [...] Glad enough, too, to be getting his hundred and twenty-five dollars [...] Through the months of the spring and fall while navigation was open. [...] Never lowered himself, though, a bit from captain and owner, [...] Knew his rights and yours, and never would thought of allowing [...] Any such thing as a liberty from you or taking one with you.

[...] Then he whirled back again, and looked up and down on the river, [...] Like he was hunting out the shape of the shore and the landmarks. [...] Well, I suppose the thing has happened to every one sometime, [...] When you find the points of the compass have swapped with each other, [...] And at the instant you're looking, the North and the South have changed [...] places.

[...] Let the spokes fly, and while I made a jump forwards to catch them, [...] Staggered into that chair--well, the very one you are in, ma'am. [...] Set there breathing quick, and, when he could speak, all he said was, [...] 'This is the end of it for me on the river, Jim Davis,' [...] Reached up over his head for his coat where it hung by that window, [...] Trembled onto his feet, and stopped in the door there a second, [...] Stared in hard like as if for good-by to the things he was used to, [...] Shut the door behind him, and never come back again through it." [...] While we were silent, not liking to prompt the pilot with questions, [...] "Well," [...] he said, at last, [...] "it was no use to argue. We tried it, [...] In the half-hearted way that people do that don't mean it. [...] Every one was his friend here on the Kanawha, and we knew [...] It was the first time he ever had lost his bearings, but he knew, [...] In such a thing as that, that the first and the last are the same time. [...] When we had got through trying our worst to persuade him, he only [...] Shook his head and says, 'I am done for, boys, and you know it,' [...] Left the boat at Wheeling, and left his life on the river-- [...] Left his life on the earth, you may say, for I don't call it living, [...] Setting there homesick at home for the wheel he can never go back to. [...] Reads the river-news regular; knows just the stage of the water [...] Up and down the whole way from Cincinnati to Pittsburg; [...] Follows every boat from the time she starts out in the spring-time [...] Till she lays up in the summer, and then again in the winter; [...] Wants to talk all about her and who is her captain and pilot; [...] Then wants to slide away to that everlastingly puzzling [...] Thing that happened to him that morning on the Kanawha [...] When he lost his bearings and North and South had changed places-- [...] No, I don't call that living, whatever the rest of you call it." [...] We were silent again till that woman spoke up, [...] "And what was it, [...] Captain, that kept him from going back and being a pilot?"
