The present study evaluated the effects of orally administered GAA on serum and urinary GAA, creatine and creatinine concentration, and on the occurrence of adverse events in healthy humans. Methods and Results; Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomized in a double-blind design to receive either GAA (2. 4 grams daily) or placebo (PLA) by oral administration for 6 weeks. Clinical trial registration: www. clinicaltrials. gov, identification number NCT 01133899. Serum creatine and creatinine increased significantly from before to after administration in GAA-supplemented participants (P &# 60; 0. 05). The proportion of participants who reported minor side effects was 58. 3 % in the GAA group and 45. 5 % {{in the placebo group}} (P = 0. 68). A few participants experienced serum creatine levels above 70 &# 181;mol/L.

It is a very popular {{indigenous}} wild vegetable and is usually utilized by many communities as a <b>nutritional</b> <b>additive.</b> Pigweed is becoming very popular nowadays because of its high nutritive value and simple growth habits. However there is very little information about growth of this plant, using effective microorganisms, thus this study is designed to evaluate the effect of inoculation of effective microorganism on growth and yield of pigweed. The experiment was performed in five liter pots representing various conditions in the field. It comprised of four treatments, replicated, five times and arranged in a complete randomized design. One set of the treatments consisted of soil collected from the field, while the other treatments consisted of soil and organic manure prepared using effective microorganisms, sterilized soil treated with effective microorganisms, and sterilized soil plus organic manure without application of effective microorganisms respectively. Shoot height, stem diameter, leaf number per plant, leaf area, leaf fresh weight, leaf dry weight, root fresh weight, root dry weight and chlorophyll a and b contents were determined. Inoculated pigweeds with effective microorganisms recorded highest values in all the parameters measured except the root dry matter accumulation.

We hypothesized that using this product as a <b>nutritional</b> <b>additive</b> in poultry diet may confer better immunity to the chickens in the paradigm of mammalian milk that enhances immunity. Therefore, we investigated the effect of hatchery eggshell membranes (HESM) as a short term feed supplement on growth performance and immunity of chickens under bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenged condition. Three studies were conducted to find the effect of HESM supplement on post hatch chickens. In the first study, the chickens were fed either a control diet or diets containing 0. 5 % whey protein or HESM as supplement and evaluated at 5 weeks of age using growth, hematology, clinical chemistry, plasma immunoglobulins, and corticosterone as variables. The second and third studies were done to compare the effects of LPS on control and HESM fed birds at 5 weeks of age following at 4 and 24 h of treatment where the HESM was also sterilized with ethanol to deplete bacterial factors. HESM supplement caused weight gain in 2 experiments and decreased blood corticosterone concentrations. While LPS caused a significant loss in body weight at 24 h following its administration, the HESM supplemented birds showed significantly less body weight loss compared with the control fed birds. The WBC, heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, and the levels of IgG were low in chickens fed diets with HESM supplement compared with control diet group. LPS challenge increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene IL- 6 but the HESM fed birds showed its effect curtailed, also, which also, favored the up-regulation of anti-inflammatory genes compared with control diet fed chickens. Post hatch supplementation of HESM appears to improve performance, modulate immunity, and increase resistance of chickens to endotoxin...|$|R
40|$|Coca (Erythroxylum sp.) is a genus {{of plants}} in the family Erythroxylaceae, whose most {{important}} species come from the Andean region of South America. Coca leaves are traditionally used as a medicament, a stimulant or {{for the production of}} food products. In some areas, coca {{is an important part of}} the culture. On the other hand, coca is notoriously known as a raw material for the production of cocaine which is then illegally distributed throughout the world. The aim of this thesis was to objectively summarize and evaluate information about coca shrub, its expansion, growing, and especially about the use and importance of the coca leafs. This information was obtained from specialist literature, scientific articles and works of national and international organizations. Coca leaves contain high levels of lipids, protein, carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins A, E, B 2, B 5, B 6 and B 12, calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, potassium and zinc in comparison with selected food (corn, beans, bananas, cow milk, chicken meat), they also have a high calorific value. Therefore, coca is an important <b>nutritional</b> <b>additive.</b> The leaves are chewed or used to manufacture traditional medicines, alcoholic drinks, mate de coca tea, Coca-Cola, cosmetic products, cigarettes, and concentrated cocaine, which occurs in coca leaves as an alkaloid to a concentration of 1, 5 %. Coca is part of traditional festivals and celebrations (e. g. baptisms, engagements, weddings and funerals), serves as a sacrifice and an idol, is offered at social gatherings and appears in folk tales. Coca is chewed mainly for its stimulant effects, it also suppresses hunger and fatigue and generally improves mood. In terms of pharmaceutical effects, risks and other factors, coca cannot be regarded as comparable to cocaine. Thanks to its positive effects and profound cultural importance, coca should remain part of the Andean tradition. In addition, it could also find use in modern medicine.

Frequencies of auxotrophs and high alkaloid producers were on the order of 1 to 2 %. Some of the auxotrophic mutants derived from strain ATCC 20102 were constantly segregating prototrophs. High-alkaloid-producing derivatives showed sclerotia-like morphology and violet-brown pigmentation, in contrast to the parent strain; some of them also showed segregation sectors when grown as giant colonies. Mutagenesis of strain 1029, isolated during this study and having an increased level of alkaloid synthesis and sclerotia-like cell morphology, was done in the same fashion as with the original parent strain, ATCC 20102. Mutants obtained from this strain were all stable with respect to their genotypes. However, a large proportion of colonies derived from regenerated protoplasts, even in the mutagen-free controls, showed a lowered level of alkaloid production and were morphologically more similar to the original wild type, ATCC 20102.

40|$|This work {{reviews the}} use of porous silicon (PS) as a {{nanomaterial}} which is extensively investigated and utilized for various applications, e. g., {{in the fields of}} optics, sensor technology and biomedicine. Furthermore the combination of PS with one or more materials which are also nanostructured due to their deposition within the porous matrix is discussed. Such nanocompounds offer a broad avenue of new and interesting properties depending on the kind of involved materials as well as on their morphology. The filling of the pores performed by electroless or electrochemical deposition is described, whereas different morphologies, reaching from micro- to macro pores are utilized as host material which can be self-organized or fabricated by prestructuring. For metal-deposition within the porous structures, both ferromagnetic and non-magnetic metals are used. Emphasis will be put on self-arranged mesoporous silicon, offering a quasi-regular pore arrangement, employed as template for filling with ferromagnetic metals. By varying the deposition parameters the precipitation of the metal structures within the pores can be tuned in geometry and spatial distribution leading to samples with desired magnetic properties. The correlation between morphology and magnetic behaviour of such semiconducting/magnetic systems will be determined. Porous silicon and its combination with a variety of filling materials leads to nanocomposites with specific physical properties caused by the nanometric size and give rise to a multiplicity of potential applications in spintronics, magnetic and magneto-optic devices, <b>nutritional</b> food <b>additives</b> as well as drug delivery...|$|R

Twenty-two freshly frozen human milk samples were measured for lysozyme activity, total IgA, and specific IgA to Escherichia coli serotypes 01, 04, and 06. One mL aliquots were mixed with the following: 1 mL of Similac, Similac Special Care, Enfamil, Enfamil Premature Formula, and sterile water; 33 mL of Poly-Vi-Sol, 33 mg of Moducal, and 38 mg of breast-milk fortifier, and then reanalyzed. Significant decreases (41 % to 74 %) in lysozyme activity were seen with the addition of all formulas; breast-milk fortifier reduced activity by 19 %, while no differences were seen with Moducal, sterile water, or Poly-Vi-Sol. No differences were seen in total IgA content, but some decreases were seen in specific IgA to E. coli serotypes 04 and 06.

However, gluten is a structure-building protein essential for formulating leavened baked goods. Therefore, obtaining high-quality gluten-free bread (GFB) is a technological challenge. This review focuses on contemporary approaches in gluten-free baking that allow improvements at the structure, texture, acceptability, nutritive value, and shelf life of GFB. Gluten-free breadmaking is a relatively new, emerging research topic that is attracting worldwide attention in order to develop different kinds of GFB, including regional varieties. Several approaches have been used to understand and improve GFB systems by evaluating different flours and starch sources, ingredients added for <b>nutritional</b> purposes, <b>additives,</b> and technologies or a combination of these elements. Some studies aimed to assess or improve GFB's technological or nutritional properties, while others had multiple objectives. Several studies used food science tools in order to improve technological and sensory quality of GFB, together with nutritional value. Some GFBs are vehicles of nutrients and bioactive compounds. Furthermore, extensive research on interfacing food science, nutrition, and health is needed so that a GFB with both good technological and nutritional properties can be prepared and made more available to those with celiac disease, which will help them adhere to a strict gluten-free diet, increase social inclusion, and improve their quality of life.

Agreement exits regarding the need for dietary phosphate control, but it is quite challenging in the real-life setting. Effective strategies to control dietary phosphorus intake include restricting phosphorus-rich foods, preferring phosphorus sourced from plant origin, boiling as the preferred cooking procedure and avoiding foods with phosphorus-containing <b>additives.</b> <b>Nutritional</b> education is crucial in this regard. Based on the existing literature, we developed the "phosphorus pyramid", namely a novel, visual, user-friendly tool for the nutritional education of patients and health-care professionals. The pyramid consists of six levels in which foods are arranged {{on the basis of their}} phosphorus content, phosphorus to protein ratio and phosphorus bioavailability. Each has a colored edge (from green to red) that corresponds to recommended intake frequency, ranging from "unrestricted" to "avoid as much as possible". The aim of the phosphorus pyramid is to support dietary counseling in order to reduce the phosphorus load, a crucial aspect of integrated CKD-MBD management. Phosphorus retention plays {{a pivotal role}} in the onset of mineral and bone disorders (MBD) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Phosphorus retention commonly occurs as a result of net intestinal absorption exceeding renal excretion or dialysis removal.
