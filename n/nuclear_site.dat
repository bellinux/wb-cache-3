5|$|Franklin Thompson Matthias (13 March 1908 – 3 December 1993) was an American civil {{engineer}} who directed {{construction of the}} Hanford <b>nuclear</b> <b>site,</b> a key facility of the Manhattan Project during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Hatfield co-sponsored nuclear freeze {{legislation}} with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, {{as well as}} co-authoring {{a book on the}} topic. He also {{advocated for}} the closure of the N-Reactor at the Hanford <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Site</b> in the 1980s, though he was a supporter of nuclear fusion programs. The N-Reactor was used for producing weapons grade plutonium while producing electricity.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, a safe was {{discovered}} during excavations of a burial trench at the Hanford <b>nuclear</b> <b>site.</b> Inside the safe were various items, including a large glass bottle containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently {{identified as the}} oldest sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist. Isotope analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory indicated that the plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge during 1944.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the Hanford site {{represented}} {{two-thirds of}} the nation's high-level radioactive waste by volume. Hanford is currently the most contaminated <b>nuclear</b> <b>site</b> in the United States and {{is the focus of}} the nation's largest environmental cleanup. Besides the cleanup project, Hanford also hosts a commercial nuclear power plant, the Columbia Generating Station, and various centers for scientific research and development, such as the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the LIGO Hanford Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 19th century, {{public and private}} sectors have heavily {{developed}} the river. To aid ship and barge navigation, locks have been built along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and dredging has opened, maintained, and enlarged shipping channels. Since the early 20th century, dams have been built across the river for power generation, navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The 14 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia's main stem and many more on its tributaries produce more than 44percent of total U.S. hydroelectric generation. Production of nuclear power has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced for decades at the Hanford Site, which is now the most contaminated <b>nuclear</b> <b>site</b> in the US. These developments have greatly altered river environments in the watershed, mainly through industrial pollution and barriers to fish migration.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{has since}} undertaken numerous missions during the Second Intifada and Operation Cast Lead. During the Second Lebanon War the Hammers flew 1,400 sorties, totalling 2,300 flying hours, {{more than any}} other IAF combat unit. During this conflict, the Ra'am's long range and endurance served it well in the close support role, as the aircraft could carry more munitions and remain on station longer than any other strike aircraft. It is these capabilities that place 69 Squadron at the forefront of Israel's strategic arm, and it is thus this unit that is reputed to have undertaken Operation Orchard, the destruction of a Syrian <b>nuclear</b> <b>site</b> on September 6, 2007. The squadron has also been linked to a possible Israeli strike against the Iranian nuclear program.|$|E

5|$|Fluor {{has been}} working on the cleanup and {{shutdown}} of atomic energy plants in Ohio and Washington since the 1990s. In 1992, Fluor won a contract with the United States Energy Department to clean up nuclear waste. By 1996 Hanford was the most contaminated <b>nuclear</b> <b>site</b> in the US and the US Department of Energy was conducting a $50 billion to $60 billion cleanup of the site. Fluor Hanford Inc. replaced Westinghouse Hanford Co. on the project. After a chemical explosion in 1997, 11 workers filed a lawsuit alleging they were denied appropriate medical attention and protective gear. Fluor and the workers disagreed on whether the explosion resulted in any injuries. In 2005 the US Department of Energy fined Fluor for safety violations and that same year a jury awarded $4.7 million in damages to 11 pipe fitters that claimed they were fired after complaining that a valve rated for 1,975 pounds-per-inch was being used where 2,235 were needed.|$|E
25|$|Richland, Washington was {{the first}} city {{established}} to support plutonium production at the nearby Hanford <b>nuclear</b> <b>site,</b> to power the American nuclear weapons arsenals. It produced plutonium for use in cold war atomic bombs.|$|E

25|$|In France, {{there were}} mass protests {{in the early}} 1970s, {{organized}} at nearly every planned <b>nuclear</b> <b>site</b> in France. Between 1975 and 1977, some 175,000 people protested against nuclear power in ten demonstrations. In 1977 there was a massive demonstration at the Superphénix breeder reactor in Creys-Malvillein which culminated in violence.|$|E

25|$|Reprocessing of {{commercial}} nuclear fuel to make MOX {{was done in}} the Sellafield MOX Plant (England). As of 2015, MOX fuel is made in France (see Marcoule <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Site),</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} in Russia (see Mining and Chemical Combine), India and Japan. China plans to develop fast breeder reactors (see CEFR) and reprocessing.|$|E
50|$|It was {{confirmed}} that Pakistan has built Soviet-style road-mobile missiles, state-of-the-art air defences around strategic sites, and other concealment measures. In 1998, Pakistan had 'at least six secret locations' {{and since then}} it is believed Pakistan may have many more such secret sites. In 2008, the United States admitted {{that it did not}} know where all of Pakistan's <b>nuclear</b> <b>sites</b> are located. Pakistani defence officials have continued to rebuff and deflect American requests for more details about the location and security of the country's <b>nuclear</b> <b>sites.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Access {{to nuclear}} sites:According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran {{has not yet}} {{declared}} the full scope of its programme and has not allowed a full-unrestricted access to all its <b>nuclear</b> <b>sites.</b> The programme is 18 years old, {{and part of it}} was outside of the IAEA preview. This situation has worried the IAEA and the international community. Iran says that it has allowed the IAEA to access all its <b>nuclear</b> <b>sites,</b> voluntarily and more than any other country by signing additional NPT protocols.|$|R

25|$|In 2008, twenty Greenpeace activists delayed {{construction}} of a new nuclear reactor being built in Flamanville for 50 hours. In July 2008 there were a series of accidents at the French <b>nuclear</b> <b>site</b> Tricastin-Pierrelatte, and Greenpeace France launched two court cases in an effort to find out more details about these. In August 2008, Sortir du nucléaire called Areva's radioactive emissions 'very dangerous' and sought an official safety inspection of its factories.|$|E

500|$|In 1953, {{they made}} their first {{attempts}} {{using one of the}} large reactors at the Hanford <b>nuclear</b> <b>site</b> in what is now known as the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment. Their detector now included [...] of scintillating fluid and 90 photomultiplier tubes, but the effort was frustrated by background noise from cosmic rays. With [...] encouragement from John A. Wheeler, they tried again in 1955, this time using one of the newer, larger 700 MW reactors at the Savannah River Site that emitted a high neutrino flux of 1.2 x 1012 / cm2 sec. They also had a convenient, well-shielded location [...] from the reactor and [...] underground. On June 14, 1956, they were able to send Pauli a telegram announcing that the neutrino had been found. When Bethe was informed that he had been proven wrong, he said, [...] "Well, you shouldn’t believe everything you read in the papers." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive Sidney Sheinberg {{made some}} {{suggestions}} to the script, changing Marty's mother's name from Meg to Lorraine (the {{name of his}} wife, actress Lorraine Gary), to change Brown's name from Professor Brown to Doc Brown and replace his pet chimpanzee with a dog. Sheinberg also wanted the title changed to Spaceman from Pluto, convinced no successful film ever had [...] "future" [...] in the title. He suggested Marty introduce himself as [...] "Darth Vader from the planet Pluto" [...] while dressed as an alien forcing his dad to ask out his mom (rather than [...] "the planet Vulcan"), and that the farmer's son's comic book be titled Spaceman from Pluto rather than Space Zombies from Pluto. Appalled by the new title that Sheinberg wanted to impose, Zemeckis asked Spielberg for help. Spielberg subsequently dictated a memo back to Sheinberg, wherein Spielberg convinced him they thought his title was just a joke, thus embarrassing him into dropping the idea. In addition, the original climax was deemed too expensive by Universal executives and was simplified by keeping the plot within Hill Valley and incorporating the clocktower sequence. Spielberg later used the omitted refrigerator and Nevada <b>nuclear</b> <b>site</b> elements in his film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E
