40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} MicroFinance Institutions (MFIs) {{are seeking to}} diversify the <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> they offer to their clients. There is a growing {{understanding}} and acceptance of the diverse nature of the credit needs of the poor, and an awareness {{that not all of}} these are addressed by pushing “productive loans”. Thus there is a pressing need to examine the best ways of designing and introducing <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> products into MFIs. This paper is written {{on the basis of the}} experience of BURO, Tangail a Bangladeshi MFI committed to providing flexible and responsive <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> to its clients and operating in what is perhaps the most competitive market in the world of MicroFinance. Having long been a market leader in open access voluntary savings accounts, BURO, Tangail is currently testing a wide variety of savings and loan products. The methods used to develop these broadly followed four key phases of <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> product development: 1. Research to identify needs and opportunities, 2.

5000|$|Savings {{were soon}} {{swallowed}} up by the insatiable inflation. The way to profit was to obtain non-indexed loans at negative real interest rates from commercial and savings banks. Such loans soon shrank to a pittance as double-digit inflation raged, while leaving deposit owners with mere remnants of their savings. [...] The unacceptable situation was eventually brought to an end by legislation providing for indexation in 1979. The banks did their best to attract savings from Icelanders who had long since given up on depositing their money only to see it wither away. No less urgent was the need to combat excessive and often unprofitable investment which had become endemic in times of negative real interest rates. [...] Although inflation was far from contained, the defence of indexation used by the banks to protect their operations managed to mitigate its damaging impact. A new króna was introduced, various technological changes transformed the banking system and <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> appeared.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Since the 1980 s, {{banks and}} {{financial}} service institutions {{have been running}} in an endless race of innovation {{to cope with the}} advancing technology, the fierce competition, and the more sophisticated and demanding customers. In order to guide their innovation efforts, several researches were conducted to identify the success and failure factors of <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> These mainly included organizational factors, marketplace factors and new service development process factors. They almost all emphasized the importance of customer and market orientation {{as a response to the}} highly perceptual and intangible characteristics of financial services. However, they deemphasized the critical characteristics of high involvement of risk and close correlation with the economic conditions, a factor that heavily contributed to the Global financial Crisis of 2008. This paper reviews the success and failure factors of <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> It then adds new perspectives emerging from the analysis of the role of innovation in the global financial crisis...|$|E

40|$|Innovation and {{customer}} relationships have been increasingly regarded as two critical elements to achieve long-term success for companies. These two elements are relatively important in service industry, {{as a result}} that both service innovation {{and customer}} relationships {{are closely related to}} the interaction between customers and suppliers in service sectors. However, few articles discussed the issues by integrated these two notions. This research is aimed {{to understand the nature of}} changes in the relationship between customers and suppliers caused by the introduction of new services, and explore the impacts due to different types of new services. A case study research on a Taiwanese bank was selected to study the changes in customer relationships after the launch of <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> According to the results, the effects of <b>new</b> <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> on customer relationships are presented in three dimensions, which are relationship drivers, relationships constructs and role of employees. Further, trust is related to the supplier itself instead of new services. This research also found that the effects on customer relationships are varied in terms of radical innovations and incremental innovations.
