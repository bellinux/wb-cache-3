40|$|Despite the {{optimism}} of some molecular biologists, natural selection among the wild ancestors of crops {{is unlikely to}} have missed simple genetic improvements that would consistently have enhanced individual fitness. Tradeoff-free opportunities for further improvement of crop traits like photosynthetic efficiency or drought tolerance may therefore be elusive. Opportunities linked to acceptable tradeoffs may be abundant, however. Tradeoffs between individual competitiveness and the collective productivity of plant communities (e. g. those linked to height) have been key to past increases in yield potential. Solar tracking by leaves could involve such tradeoffs, if photosynthetic benefits to tracking leaves are outweighed by increased shading of leaves lower in the canopy. This hypothesis was tested using rotation in the horizontal plane to disrupt solar tracking in alfalfa. In sparse canopies, solar tracking increased <b>net</b> canopy <b>photosynthesis,</b> but rarely by more than 3 %. As leaf area increased, solar tracking tended to decrease <b>net</b> canopy <b>photosynthesis,</b> despite edge effects in our 1 -m 2 artificial communities, which probably exaggerated net photosynthetic benefits of tracking. Computer modeling suggested that the season-long effects of solar tracking on community productivity can be negative. Solar tracking may have persisted, nonetheless, because individuals whose leaves track the sun increase shading of competitors...|$|R

For several species of scleractinian corals, fluorescence techniques have revealed {{a significant reduction in}} photochemical efficiency of symbiotic dinoflagellates within coral tissue in response to excess light absorption. To date, it has been unclear whether or not photoinhibition has a negative impact on energy budgets in corals. We simultaneously quantified the effect of exposure to excessive light on <b>net</b> rates of <b>photosynthesis</b> and on fluorescence-derived photochemistry. We acclimated colonies of the reef-building coral Turbinaria mesenterina to 3 different irradiance regimes in the laboratory. The corals were then exposed to light levels up to 10 times higher than their acclimation irradiance and assayed for rates of photosynthesis and photochemical yields. Results indicated that daily costs of photoinhibition are negligible. Reduced <b>net</b> rates of <b>photosynthesis</b> in the afternoon, compared to the morning, were predominantly due to enhanced afternoon rates of dark respiration. However, photoacclimation to high light levels reduces daily energy acquisition in the long term, primarily due to decreased chlorophyll concentrations. Therefore, although changes in the photosynthetic activity of symbiotic dinoflagellates over a diurnal irradiance cycle do not cause a measurable decline in net oxygen evolution for coral colonies, repeated exposure to excessive irradiance can reduce energy acquisition per unit surface area, and hence influence the upper limit of the depth distribution of scleractinian corals...|$|R

Recent research revealed that high availability of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) negatively affects scleractinian corals.

This experimental study investigated the individual and combined effects of ambient and high DIC (pCO 2 403 µatm/ pHTotal 8. 2 and 996 µatm/pHTotal 7. 8) and DOC (added as Glucose 0 and 294 µmol/L, background DOC concentration of 83 µmol/L) availability on the physiology (<b>net</b> and gross <b>photosynthesis,</b> respiration, dark and light calcification, and growth) of the scleractinian coral Acropora millepora (Ehrenberg, 1834) from the Great Barrier Reef over a 16 day interval.

High DOC availability reduced <b>net</b> and gross <b>photosynthesis</b> by 51 % and 39 %, respectively, but did not affect respiration.

Combination of high DIC and high DOC availability did not affect photosynthesis, light calcification, respiration or growth, but significantly decreased dark calcification when compared to both controls and DIC treatments. On the ecosystem level, high DIC concentrations may lead to reduced accretion and growth of reefs dominated by Acropora that under elevated DOC concentrations will likely exhibit reduced primary production rates, ultimately leading to loss of hard substrate and reef erosion. It is therefore important to consider the potential impacts of elevated DOC and DIC simultaneously to assess real world scenarios, as multiple rather than single factors influence key physiological processes in coral reefs...|$|R

To test the effects of climate and agricultural practices on the ecophysiology of pigeonpea, we conducted a two-year field experiment in Nashville, Tennessee.

The high values observed in 2011 were mainly due to high precipitation rates during and after the flowering time. Pigeonpea varieties G 1 and W 3 had higher photosynthetic rates and LAI while variety W 3 had the highest WUE.

Despite their great contribution to the world economy, anthropogenic influence via carbon dioxide emissions is leading to unprecedented changes with concerns about subsequent negative impacts on reefs. Surface ocean pH has dropped 0. 1 units in the past century; in spite of this rapid shift in oceanic chemistry, it is unclear if individual species or life stages of Caribbean stony corals will be more sensitive to ocean acidification (OA). Examined is the relationship between CO 2 -induced seawater acidification, <b>net</b> calcification, <b>photosynthesis,</b> and respiration in three model Caribbean coral species: Orbicella faveolata, Montastraea cavernosa, and Dichocoenia stokesi, under near ambient (465 ± 5. 52 ppm), and high (1451 ± 6. 51 ppm) CO 2 conditions. A species specific response was observed for net calcification; D. stokesi and M. cavernosa displayed a significant reduction in CaCO 3 secreted under OA conditions, while O. faveolata fragments showed no significant difference. At the cellular level, transmission electron micrographs verified that all species and treatments were actively calcifying. Skeletal crystals nucleated by O. faveolata in the high CO 2 treatments were statistically longer relative to controls. These results suggest that the addition of CO 2 may shift the overall energy budget, causing a modification of skeletal aragonite crystal structures, rather than inhibiting skeletal crystal formation. Consequential to this energy shift, Orbicella faveolata belongs in the category of Scleractinian corals that exhibit a lower sensitivity to ocean acidification...|$|R

It has been criticized as an indicator, especially when the water deficit is not severe and/or when the weightings are not performed carefully [20]. In the first experiment, a very {{significant difference in the}} RWC was observed in co-inoculated ‘Grafite’ beans between the water-stress and recovery periods (Table  4).

Thus, we used the <b>net</b> relative <b>photosynthesis</b> rate and the stomatal conductance to evaluate the water status and performance of co-inoculated plants (Figs.  2, 3). Similar trends were observed using the biochemical indicator to monitor the stress effects.

When shaded, all species shifted partitioning of biomass from stem thickening to leaf area expansion and occupied a larger crown volume for a given shoot biomass. Leaf numbers per stem length of divaricates and non-divaricates were greater in the lower and upper canopies, respectively, consistent with the view that in divaricates outer branches protect inner leaves. However, leaf numbers per stem length showed no response to variation in high light receipt. Divaricates showed some traits typical of plants adapted to sunny habitats: smaller effective leaf size, lesser fractional partitioning of biomass to leaves, and greater foliage densities. Other traits of divaricates were typical of plants adapted to shaded habitats: lesser stem diameters, stem biomass per unit stem length, leader dominance, leaf area index, and heights relative to crown diameters; and more horizontal twig orientations.

Sediment Pg, Pn and RL decreased {{as the number of}} Ulva layers increased; however, 1. 6 times higher macroalgal density was necessary to fully inhibit cyanobacteria Pg compared with diatoms, indicating that cyanobacteria were better adapted to this light environment. Long-term (3 weeks) incubations of diatom-dominated sediments below increasing layers of Ulva resulted in a shift in the taxonomic composition of the MPB towards cyanobacteria. Hence, changes in the light climate below macroalgal accumulations can negatively affect the photosynthetic activity of sediments. However, spectral niche differentiation of MPB taxonomic groups and concurrent changes in the MPB community may provide sediments with increased resilience to the detrimental effects of eutrophication.

40|$|Mini UV lamps were {{installed}} over antarctic plants at Leonie Island, Antarctic peninsula, and shoot length measurements of Deschampsia antarctica were performed during the austral summer January-February 1999. We studied {{the response of}} the antarctic hairgrass, Deschampsia antarctica to enhanced UV-B. In a climate room experiment we exposed tillers of Deschampsia antarctica, collected at Leonie Island, Antarctic peninsula, to ambient and enhanced levels of UV-B radiation. In this climate room experiment with 0, 2. 5 and 5 kJ m(- 2) day(- 1) UV-B-BE treatments we observed that length growth of shoots at 2. 5 and 5 kJ m(- 2) day(- 1) UV-B-BE was markedly reduced compared to 0 kJ m(- 2) day(- 1) UV-B-BE. In addition, there was an increased number of shoots and increased leaf thickness with enhanced UV- B. The Relative Growth Rate (RGR) was not affected by UV-B, possibly because reduced shoot length growth by enhanced UV-B was compensated by increased tillering. Light response curves of <b>net</b> leaf <b>photosynthesis</b> of plants exposed to 5 kJ m(- 2) day(-) 1 UV-BBE did not differ from those exposed to 0 kJ m(-) 2 day(- 1) UV-B-BE. The content of UV-B absorbing compounds of plants exposed to increasing UV-B did not significantly change. Mini UV-B lamp systems {{were installed}} in the field, to expose the terrestrial antarctic vegetation at Leonie Island to enhanced solar UV-B. In that study, the increment of shoot length of tagged plants of Deschampsia antarctica during the January-February 1999 at Leonie Island, was recorded and compared to shoot length growth under controlled conditions. The consequences of enhanced UV-B radiation as a result of ozone depletion for the terrestrial antarctic ecosytems are discussed.
