5|$|Charlton {{lost the}} 1925 election, {{largely due to}} his stance on {{industrial}} relations and continual militant union action which plagued his campaign. Charlton always aided in maintaining amicable relations in the party and many times lent his expertise to conflicts within the NSW branch of the Labor Party. He resigned from his positions on 29 March 1928. His successor James Scullin {{went on to become}} the Prime Minister of Australia, something Charlton <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> to do.|$|E
5|$|However, Peckham {{worked hard}} to reorganise the estates of the diocese, and held an inquiry in 1283 through 1285 into the {{revenues}} of the see. He set up administrative structures in the manors that divided them into seven administrative groups. Peckham, though, was almost continually in debt, {{and because he was}} a Franciscan, he had no personal property to help with his living expenses. He had inherited the diocesan debts that his predecessor had allowed to accumulate, and <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> to clear them.|$|E

5|$|Life in a workhouse was {{intended}} to be harsh, to deter the able-bodied poor and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply. But in areas such as the provision of free medical care and education for children, neither of which was available to the poor in England living outside workhouses until the early 20th century, workhouse inmates were advantaged over the general population, a dilemma that the Poor Law authorities <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> to reconcile.|$|E
5|$|Marie's {{popularity}} {{was severely}} affected during Michael's reign and, after {{refusing to be}} part of the regency council in 1929, she was accused by the press, and even by Princess Helen, of plotting a coup. During this time, there were numerous rumours as to Princess Ileana's marriage. After talk of Ileana marrying the Tsar of Bulgaria or the Prince of Asturias, she was eventually betrothed to Alexander, Count of Hochberg, a minor German prince, in early 1930. This betrothal was, however, short-lived and Marie <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> to conclude a political marriage for her youngest daughter, instead marrying her to Archduke Anton of Austria–Tuscany in 1931.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese would {{subsequently}} {{attempt to}} occupy the city, but <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> to take it. In his journal of an expedition to the region in 1497-1499, the explorer João de Sá, who accompanied Vasco da Gama on the voyage, wrote that Magadoxo (Mogadishu) was controlled by Moors. A big town surrounded by four towers, it had houses several storeys high and large palaces in its center. De Sá and his men bombarded the city before continuing southwards along the seaboard. The Hawiye Somali, however, were later successful in defeating the Ajuran State and bringing {{about the end of}} Muzaffar rule.|$|E

5|$|Increased support also materialised {{when the}} Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp, the Norwegian Farmers' Aid Association, sought {{financial}} aid from Nasjonal Samling, {{who in turn}} gained political influence and a useful existing network of well-trained party officers. Quisling's party <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> a grand anti-socialist coalition, however, {{in part because of}} competition from the Conservative Party for right-wing votes. Though Quisling remained unable to demonstrate any skill as an orator, his reputation for scandal nonetheless ensured that the electorate were aware of Nasjonal Samling's existence. As a result, the party showed only moderate success in the October elections, with 27,850 votes—approximately two per cent of the national vote, and about three and a half per cent of the vote in constituencies where it fielded candidates. This made it the fifth largest party in Norway, out-polling the Communists but not the Conservative, Labour, Liberal or Agrarian parties, and failing to secure a single seat in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{she also}} played {{the lead role}} in The Magnificent Cuckold, based on the Belgian play Le Cocu magnifique. She was {{at the height of}} her sensuality at the time, but later the film only brought back {{unpleasant}} memories for her as she experienced little empathy with the producer Antonio Pietrangeli, while the male star Ugo Tognazzi tried to seduce her. In 1965, Cardinale appeared in Visconti's Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa, known as Sandra (Of a Thousand Delights) in the USA and Of These Thousand Pleasures in the UK, playing a Holocaust survivor who may have had an incestuous relationship with her brother. Later that year, she starred opposite Rock Hudson in Universal Pictures's Blindfold, the last film to be directed by Philip Dunne. Filming began on 22 February 1965 on location in Ocala, Florida. Diane Bond doubled for Cardinale in the film. Cardinale became good friends with Hudson, who proved to be very protective of her, knowing her discomfort outside of Italy. While in Hollywood, Cardinale also became friends with Barbra Streisand, Elliott Gould, and Steve McQueen, but she <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> to feel at home there.|$|E
5|$|Pelotas was besieged and conquered by the Ragamuffins on 7 April 1836. Marques de Sousa {{was taken}} {{prisoner}} and removed to Porto Alegre, capital of Rio Grande do Sul, {{which had been}} under rebel control {{since the beginning of}} the conflict. He was held in a presiganga (prison ship). During his imprisonment, with the aid of the people of Porto Alegre, he managed to convince some of the rebel soldiers to switch sides, taking control of the entire town during the early hours of 15 June and arresting the remaining Ragamuffins. He repulsed rebel land and sea assaults against Porto Alegre on 18 June, 30 June, 15 July and 20 July; after that, the town remained in the hands of the legitimate government until the end of the conflict. The central government in Rio de Janeiro promoted Marques de Sousa to permanent major on 18 February 1837 in recognition of his vital role. The balance of power tipped against the Ragamuffins only a few months after the declaration of Rio Grande do Sul's independence on 11 September 1836. The Ragamuffins, although emboldened by their initial successes, <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> to gain control of the entire province.|$|E

5|$|The {{second and}} eldest {{surviving}} child of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI and Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Archduchess Maria Theresa was born {{early in the}} morning of 13May 1717, at the Hofburg Palace, Vienna, shortly after the death of her elder brother, Archduke Leopold, and was baptised on that same evening. The dowager empresses, her aunt Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg and grandmother Eleonor Magdalene of the Palatinate-Neuburg, were her godmothers. Most descriptions of her baptism stress that the infant was carried ahead of her cousins, Maria Josepha and Maria Amalia, the daughters of Charles VI's elder brother and predecessor, Joseph I, before the eyes of their mother, Wilhelmine Amalia. It was clear that Maria Theresa would outrank them, even though their grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, had his sons sign the Mutual Pact of Succession, which gave precedence to the daughters of the elder brother. Her father was the only surviving male member of the House of Habsburg and hoped for a son who would prevent the extinction of his dynasty and succeed him. Thus, the birth of Maria Theresa was a great disappointment to him and the people of Vienna; Charles <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> to overcome this feeling.|$|E

25|$|Although he <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> {{international}} recognition, Nicholson {{was highly}} rated by the Yorkshire public.

Mirabel alone <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> to exceed 3 million passengers per year in its existence as a passenger airport. It soon became apparent that Montreal did not need a second airport.|$|E
25|$|After the 2002 World Cup, Song left Korea to {{play for}} Dutch giants Feyenoord. He was a defender for Feyenoord most of the time, but played a couple of matches on the midfield. Song spent about three years in Rotterdam, playing in 53 matches, and scoring two goals and seven assists. When Feyenood hired a new manager, Song <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> to impress him.|$|E
25|$|By 1991 the {{technology}} used was obsolete, {{in part because}} of the use of proprietary systems instead of open Unix-bases systems. Norsk Data <b>never</b> <b>managed</b> the transition to open standards and also ceased operations.

By 1991 Skår had become director of NTNF and was responsible for evaluating the project.|$|E
