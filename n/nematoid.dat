40|$|Silk flower [Calotropis procera (Aiton) R. Br. ] is a {{very common}} plant in the {{north-eastern}} Brazil, used in the animal ration {{in the period of}} food scarcity, beyond presenting phytotherapic properties and effect presented against <b>nematoid</b> when incorporated to the ground. The work was considered to evaluate the influence of the substrate and the temperature on the germination of seeds and the development of the seedlings. The knowledge on the germination and the more adjusted substrate can propitiate an increment in the production of seedling of silk flower. The temperature can cause changes in the germination percentage, in the speed and relative frequency of germination. In laboratory experiment using the entirely randomized delineation in array factorial 3 x 3, with 4 repetitions, whose plots had been constituted by 25 seeds. The treatments had been to the combinations of three substrate (paper towel, sand and vermiculite) with three temperatures, 25 ºC (bookshelf coated with plastic canvas), 27 ºC (laboratory environment), 30 º C (chamber of controlled temperature). The analyzed variable had been the percentage of germination, VIG, SDM and height dry of the seedlings. Paper towel, under temperatures 27 and 30 °C, showed it more appropriate for the germination five days after the sowing. Sand and vermiculite under temperatures 25 and 27 ºC, showed it more appropriate for the germination and the index of speed of germination twelve days after the sowing. The dry matter of the seedlings, on sand and vermiculite was superior under temperature 30 ºC...|$|E
40|$|The {{parasitism}} {{of swine}} by <b>nematoid</b> Ascaris suum mainly {{occurs in the}} early stages of creating the animals, when the parasite makes migration hepato tracheal in those animals and can even cause death of young animals. This nematode is considered the main cause of production loss in swine farms. Given the importance of parasitism by A. suum, it is recommended as ideal conditions identify the agent in the animals the most previously possible. One of the most practical ways to make the diagnosis of this nematode would be the verification of the presence of milky white spots (spot milk) on the surface of swine livers inspected at slaughter resulting from larval migration in that organ. Also, this nematode is the leading cause of condemnation of livers at slaughter inspection. This study aims to assess the level of A. suum infection in pigs at the age of slaughter created in technified farms located in three municipalities in the Zona da Mata region. This study was conducted in three slaughterhouses located in municipality of Piranga and consisting of assess the level of observed alterations in the livers of slaughtered animals. These lesions that were observed showed it as suspicions of parasitism by A. suum in those animals, at least, at some stage of life of these. It should be remembered that some situations as low parasite load, constant cleaning of the stalls and periodic deworming of animals are responsible for many of the animals parasitized by A. suum not reached adulthood or has delayed its development, being present in animals in the larval stage L 3 (liver) and L 4 and L 5 (the lungs). By fact of this agent to be responsible for significant losses in pig farming, it is recommended that these swine farms conduct a strategic protocol of deworming in piglets and matrixes...|$|E

Walp), a clonagem e expressÃo desse gene em cÃlulas de Escherichia coli BL 21 (&# 955;) DE 3 e a determinaÃÃo via modelagem por homologia da estrutura {{tridimensional}} dessa proteÃna. A expressÃo do gene da quitinase de classe I de feijÃo-de-corda foi obtida a partir de RT-PCR com oligonucleotÃdeos iniciadores especÃficos. Nessas reaÃÃes, foram usadas amostras de RNA total de sementes e vagens em diferentes estÃgios de crescimento (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 e 18 dias), pertencentes a dois genÃtipos contrastantes quanto a infecÃÃo pelo Callosobruchus maculatus, IT 81 D- 1053 (resistente) e TE 97 - 419 - 07 F (suscetÃvel). A expressÃo foi avaliada tambÃm em folhas, raÃzes, epicÃtilo e hipocÃtilo de dois genÃtipos contrastantes quanto a infecÃÃo pelo nematÃide das galhas Meloidogyne incongnita, CE- 31 (resistente) e TE 97 - 411 - 1 F (suscetÃvel). A clonagem do gene VuChiI foi realizada a partir do produto amplificado da RT-PCR de sementes de IT 81 D- 1053, e do produto amplificado a partir do DNA genÃmico de MONTEIRO. Foram obtidos 11 clones confirmados, dos quais 9 foram seqÃenciados. A subclonagem do clone R 7 foi realizada em pET 15 b e a expressÃo da proteÃna recombinante foi induzida na presenÃa de IPTG 1 mM. A proteÃna recombinante, com aproximadamente 30 kDa, foi visualizada atravÃs de um SDS-PAGE. A proteÃna purificada atravÃs de uma cromatografia de afinidade em coluna de Sepharose com NÃquel imobilizado nÃo apresentou atividade quitinÃsica significativa. Os modelos gerados para os clones obtidos e para a quitinase nativa, indicam que as mutaÃÃes ocorridas nÃo alteram os sÃtios ativos das molÃculas. Dessa forma, a quitinase de classe I do feijÃo-de-corda parece apresentar expressÃo constitutiva em todas as partes da planta. A quitinase recombinante obtida foi pouco ativa. As mutaÃÃes pontuais nos clones obtidos sugerem a ocorrÃncia de isoformas dessa proteÃna, o que ainda deve ser elucidado no futuroIn {{this work}} {{we have made}} a preliminary study on the expression of a class I chitinase gene from cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp), cloning and expression of this gene in Escherichia coli BL 21 (&# 955;) DE 3 cells and, through homology modeling, we determined the threeÂ dimensional structure of this protein. The expression of the class I quitinase gene from cowpea was performed by RTÂPCR from the total RNA, with specific primers, from seeds and pods in distinct stages of development (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 days), belonging to two contrasting genotypes regarding to infection by Callosobruchus maculatus, IT 81 DÂ 1053 (resistant) e TE 97 Â 419 Â 07 F (susceptible). The gene expression in leaves, roots, epicotyls and hipocotyls from two contrasting genotypes considering the infection by the <b>nematoid</b> Meloidogyne incongnita, CEÂ 31 (resistant) e TE 97 Â 411 Â 1 F (susceptible). The VuChiI gene cloning was accomplished from the amplified product on RTÂPCR with IT 81 DÂ 1053 seeds, and the amplified product from the genomic DNA of MONTEIRO. Eleven clones were obtained, from which nine were sequenced. The cloning of R 7 clone was accomplished in pET 15 b vector and the expression of the recombinant protein was induced in the presence of IPTG 1 mM. The protein, with 30 kDa, was visualized through a SDSÂPAGE. The protein purified through an affinity chromatography in Sepharose column with immobilized Nickel did not had a significative hydrolytic activity. The models generated for the clones and for the native chitinase, have indicated that mutations that occurred did not changed the molecule's active sites. Thus, the class I chitinase gene from feijÃoÂ deÂ corda seems to present constitutive expression {{in all parts of the}} plant. The recombinant chitinase obtained was inactive. The specific mutations in the resulting clones suggests the occurrence of isoforms of this protein, what should be elucidated in the future...|$|E
40|$|This {{communication}} {{describes a}} new species of Mononchus which was found at the Experimental Station of Monte Alegre (Ibiti), State of São Paulo. Species of Mononchus are of interest because they {{are believed to be}} predators of other <b>nematoids.</b> The predatory habit of the new species was observed in the laboratory. Assuming that its behaviour is the same in the field, we may consider the species as an ally of man in controlling populations of <b>nematoids</b> in the soil. M. ibitiensis differs from its nearest related species M. muscorum by its smaller pharynx; by smaller dortooth, opposited by four ribs, each of which has six denticles and by the presence of three caudal glands connected with a pore without valve...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} contamination by geohelminths represents a world {{public health problem}} and {{has been well documented}} by several authors. However, few papers describe the presence of such contamination in saline soils of coastal beaches. A study was performed on the beaches of the municipality of Santos in the period between May 2004 to April 2005 with the aim of determining the degree of contamination, and the correlation between contamination level and seasonal conditions and characteristics of the environment. Of the 2, 520 samples analyzed, 18. 2 % (458) were contaminated, 32. 3 % (148) of which were localized in children's recreational areas (playgrounds). The parasite profile found in the analyzed samples indicated the presence of several zoonotic parasites: Ancylostoma larvae (82. 5 %), Toxocara sp. eggs (59. 4 %), Ancylostomidae-like eggs (37. 1 %), coccid oocysts (13. 5 %), Trichostrongylus sp. eggs and larvae, Ascaris lumbricoides eggs, (11. 6 %), Entamoeba sp. cysts (10. 0 %), Strongyloides sp. (4. 8 %), several free <b>nematoids</b> and some non-identified parasitic structures (3. 3 %). It was established that the highest frequency of parasitic structures occurred in the months between May and October 2004, and from February to March 2005. An increase in the diversity of parasitic forms was documented in the months between February to December 2004 and from January to April 2005, these periods having the highest rainfall...|$|R
40|$|Devido às condições ambientais verificadas no estado do Acre, caracterizado pela ocorrência de temperaturas elevadas e alta precipitação, as cultivares tradicionalmente utilizadas pelos produtores apresentam baixo rendimento e qualidade. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar o comportamento das novas cultivares de alface disponíveis no mercado, em termos de características agronômicas e rendimento, nas condições edafoclimáticas de Rio Branco, Acre. Para isso foram realizados dois ensaios no campo {{experimental}} da Embrapa Acre, em um solo do tipo Argissolo Vermelho-Escuro, textura argilosa. O primeiro de maio a julho de 1996 (período seco) e o segundo de dezembro de 1996 a fevereiro de 1997 (período chuvoso). Foram avaliadas as cultivares Babá de Verão, Brisa, Carolina AG- 576, Elisa, Lucy Brown, Marisa AG- 216, Piracicaba 65, Regina 71, Tainá, Simpson, Vanessa e Verônica, sendo que 'Regina 71 ' e 'Elisa' foram incluídas apenas no ensaio do período seco. O delineamento experimental foi o de blocos casualizados, com três repetições. No período seco, as cultivares Simpson, Lucy Brown e Regina 71 apresentaram os maiores pesos médios (373; 362 e 341 g, respectivamente) e produções comerciais de 49, 8; 48, 3 e 45, 5 t/ha, respectivamente. Em geral, as cultivares dos tipos lisa sem cabeça e lisa com cabeça apresentaram maior índice de ataque de nematóide (Meloidogyne javanica) quando comparadas às do tipo crespa. No ensaio realizado no período chuvoso, as cultivares Marisa AG- 216, Verônica, Lucy Brown, Brisa, Tainá e Piracicaba- 65 apresentaram os maiores pesos médios e produções comerciais. Entretanto, as médias obtidas foram bem inferiores às verificadas no ensaio do período seco, variando de 164 a 198 g para o peso médio, e 21, 9 a 25, 9 t/ha para produção comercial. Dentre as cultivares avaliadas no período seco, Regina 71 (lisa, sem cabeça) e Carolina AG- 576 (lisa, com cabeça) destacaram-se entre as do tipo lisa, apresentando folhas de tamanho uniforme e bem arranjadas. Entre as de folha crespa solta destacaram-se as cultivares. Verônica e Marisa. A cultivar Lucy Brown do tipo americana (crisp head) também foi bastante produtiva. Due to {{the environmental}} conditions verified {{in the state of}} Acre, characterized by the occurrence of high temperatures and precipitation, cultivars traditionally used by the producers present low yield and poor quality. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the behavior of the new lettuce cultivars available in the market, in terms of agronomic characteristics and yield, in the climatic and soil conditions of Rio Branco. Two trials were accomplished in the Embrapa Acre experimental farm, in a dark red claysoil, of loamy texture. The first from May to July 1996 (dry season) and the second from December 1996 to February 1997 (rainy season). The cultivars Babá de Verão, Brisa, Carolina AG- 576, Elisa, Lucy Brown, Marisa AG- 216, Piracicaba 65, Regina 71, Tainá, Simpson, Vanessa and Verônica were evaluated. 'Regina 71 ' and 'Elisa' were only included on the dry season trial. The experimental design was a randomized block, with three replications. During the dry season, the cultivars Simpson, Lucy Brown and Regina 71 presented the largest average weights (373; 362 and 341 g, respectively) and commercial yields (49. 8; 48. 3 and 45. 5 t/ha, respectively). In general, the cultivars with smooth leaves with or without head presented larger <b>nematoid</b> (Meloidogyne javanica) attack index, when compared to the curly type ones. In the rainy season trials, the cultivars Marisa AG- 216, Verônica, Lucy Brown, Brisa, Tainá and Piracicaba- 65 presented the greatest average weights and commercial yields. However, the obtained averages were very inferior to that verified in the trials of the dry period, varying from 164 to 198 g for average weight, and from 21. 9 to 25. 9 t/ha for commercial yield. Of those cultivars tested on the dry season, Regina 71 (butter head/less firm head) and Carolina (butter head) AG- 576 stood out among the butterhead types, while Verônica, Marisa AG- 216 (loose leaf/wavy and frilled leaves) were the best among the loose leaf types, obtaining good yield. 'Lucy Brown' stood out among the crisphead types...|$|E
40|$|Examining the {{intestinal}} tract {{of a female}} of Struthio molybdophanes Rchw., died in the Zoological garden at Rotterdam, I found in both the coeca {{a large number of}} <b>Nematoids,</b> which I believe to represent a new species, belonging to the genus Sclerostoma Rud. The parasite is characterized as follows: Body cylindrical, transversely striated, slightly narrowed in front, attenuated gradually towards the posterior extremity, with two narrow lateral-membranes. Anterior part of the head surrounded by an annular wall. Buccal capsule with a single row of stiff cilia, surrounding the mouth and a longitudinal furrow along the middle of the dorsal side. The sub-median oral papillae are conical, the lateral ones spade-shaped. Two small, pointed neck-papillae about the middle of the oesophagus. The caudal extremity of the male bent backwards and furnished with a trilobed bursa, consisting of two broad, rather polygonal, lateral lobes and a narrower, pear-shaped dorsal one. Each posterior ray bears at its base two short secondary branches, of which the external is somewhat longer than the internal. The posterior lateral ray (costa posterior externa Schneid. ¹)) is rather slender and originates beneath the base of the common stam of the posterior rays; the middle rays are separated, the anterior being larger than the posterior. The anterior lateral ray (costa anterior externa Schneid.) is short and narrow, not much longer than the half of the middle ray; two anterior rays, of which the external is somewhat longer than the internal. Before the cloacal opening of the male there are two large and several small papillae. Two long, slightly S-like bent spicules, measuring 0, 87 m. m., with their distal extremity curved kneelike. The caudal extremity of the female terminating in a conical, pointed tail; a large, papillose elevation before the vulva, situated 0, 25 m. m. above the point of the tail. A bifurcated vagina, passing into two parallel uterine ducts, directed forwards and terminating each in a long ovarian coecum, with numerous coils...|$|R
