This paper uses the Concentration Ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index {{to measure the}} degree of market concentration.

40|$|This paper uses {{disaggregated}} data on real <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums,</b> including life and <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums,</b> {{to examine the}} interrelationship between insurance markets’ activities and economic growth for 10 selected OECD countries during the up-to-date 1979 - 2006 period. We take recently developed panel unit-root tests, heterogeneous panel cointegration tests, and panel causality techniques and conclude that there is fairly strong evidence favoring the hypothesis of a long-run equilibrium relationship between real GDP and insurance markets’ activities after allowing for the heterogeneous country effect. The results of the long-run panel regression parameter indicate a significantly positive relationship between real GDP and the activities within the insurance market, while a development from the <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> market has {{a greater impact on}} real GDP than the activities in the life insurance market do. By implementing the dynamic panel-based error correction model, we determine that insurance markets’ development and economic growth present both the long-run and short-run bidirectional causalities. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to study the {{adjustment}} dynamics of the <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> (NLIP) and test its dependence to the financial markets in five countries (Canada, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). First, we justify the linkage between the insurance and the financial markets by the underwriting cycle theory and financial models of insurance pricing. Second, we examine the relationship between the NLIP, the interest rate, and the stock price using the recent developments of nonlinear econometrics. We use threshold cointegration models: the switching transition error correction models (STECM). We show that STECM perform better than a linear error correction model (LECM) to reproduce the NLIP dynamics. Our empirical results show that the adjustment of the NLIP in France, Japan, and the United States is rather discontinuous, asymmetrical, and nonlinear. Moreover, we suggest a strong evidence of significant linkages between insurance and financial markets, show two regimes for the NLIP, and find that the NLIP adjustment toward equilibrium is time varying with a convergence speed that varies according to the insurance disequilibrium size.

40|$|In {{recent years}} several {{commentators}} have noted {{evidence for a}} “reserving cycle ” linked to the underwriting cycle. It seems that in many classes of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance,</b> when <b>premium</b> rates are relatively low, claim development patterns tend to be longer-tailed than when premium rates are high. If this is the case, then traditional reserving methods based on an assumption that the development pattern {{is the same for}} all origin years will tend to overstate reserves for periods where premium rates were high, and understate reserves for periods where premium rates were low. The present paper reviews the evidence for a reserving cycle and discusses possible causes. A mathematical model is then proposed that accommodates the main possible causes. The purpose of this model is three-fold: (a) to test for the existence of reserving cycle effects, (b) to help identify the causes, and (c) to produce improved reserve estimates. An example analysis is presented using the proposed model. The evidence for the existence of reserving cycles is now sufficiently strong that, in the author’s opinion, it is important for reserving actuaries {{to be aware of the}} possibility of cyclical effects, to investigate evidence for such effects in any reserving exercise, and (where there is strong evidence) to adjust reserve estimates accordingly. The model proposed in the present paper can be implemented in Excel and will often be a useful tool for these purposes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss whether {{insurers}} could have a strong motivation for M&A in the future because they need to survive within the industry under oversaturated market conditions. Recently, Japanese <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> markets, mainly the automobile insurance market, have reached the point of saturation due to the oversaturated domestic automobile market. At that time, the industry has also experienced successive large-scale M&A transactions. Design/methodology/approach – Using a theoretical model developed by Salent et al., the authors discuss whether an insurer's motivation for M&A could be affected by a saturation of the market. The authors also clarify whether <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> deregulation is a necessary condition for merger incentives. Findings – The authors conclude that, first, necessary requirement for insurers' motivation of consolidations is to loosen the rate regulation; and second, the sufficient condition is saturation of market.
