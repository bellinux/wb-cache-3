2500|$|Unlike {{the magical}} realist writers, the McOndos wrote [...] "here-and-now!" [...] fiction, about the 21st-century world they inhabit, and which {{surrounds}} them, and the homogenizing cultural-identity messages of pervasive mass communications media; to be Latin in an Anglo culture. Because contemporary Latin America {{is a cultural}} conflation of the 19th and 21st centuries, the McOndos substantive and technical divergence from Magical Realism (style, narrative mode, etc.) voided their predecessor traditions. Alberto Fuguet explains, [...] "I feel [...] the great literary theme of ‘Latin American identity’ (who are we?) must <b>now</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> back seat {{to the theme of}} ‘personal identity’ (who am I?)." [...] Whilst rejecting the resultant stereotype [...] "Latin American Literature" [...] derived from Magical Realism, the McOndos nonetheless respect the man; [...] "I’m a really big fan of Márquez, but, what I really hate is the software he created, that other people use [...] [...] [...] they turn [...] into more of an aesthetic [...] instead of an ideology.
