In the present work the preparation of nanocrystalline hexagonal WO 3 (hex-WO 3) from sodium tungstate solution by acidic precipitation as a <b>nanocrystalline</b> <b>processing</b> route is presented. Metal decorated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were added to hex-WO 3 nanopowder with the aim to further lower the operating temperature of sensors. Hex-WO 3 /Au-decorated MWCNTs composites were able to detect as low as 100 ppb of NO 2, with no need to heat the sensors substrates during operation, which demonstrates the high potential of our new gas sensors. The developed porous tungsten oxide nanofibers might be find application on a special chip designed for gas sensorics. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} mullite composite nanocrystaline from high-silica kaolin sampled from Tianyang County of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region {{is presented in}} this paper. Rough kaolin is firstly grounded and processed to remove impurities, iron and carbon before burned to produce composite oxides with mullite as major components. The composite oxides are further synthesized into composite mullite nanocrystaline by using hydrothermal crystallization process under low temperature and normal pressure. Tests on the composite nanocrystalline by TEM, TG-TDA, and X-ray diffraction methods show that the nanocrystalline {{range in size from}} 40 to 100 nm and are well textured. They also show significantly enhanced thermal stability at temperature as high as 1000 oC. Synthesis of Mullite Composite <b>Nanocrystalline</b> Sample <b>processing</b> and preparation. Oxidation-reduction bleaching method is used to purify the samples. Tianyang rough kaolin contains iron-bearing minerals such as pyrite. Firstly with oxidation the iron ions within pyrite become ferric irons, and secondly the reduction changes ferric irons into ferrous ions. Ferrous ions are finally removed. The bleaching also helps removing organic matter[1]. The protocol is described as follows: The rough sample is weighted 20 gm. Solution of KMnO 4 or H 2 O 2 is added to the sample so the sample is oxidized. The sample should be stirred from time to tim...|$|R

The characteristics of nanocrystalline powders after heat {{treatment in the}} temperature range from 500 to 1200 °C were investigated by XRD phase analysis, scanning electron microscopy, petrography and BET measurements. It was found that hydrothermally treated powders contained metastable low-temperature cubic solid solution based on ZrO 2 and addition of Al 2 O 3 increased temperature of phase transformation of the metastable cubic- ZrO 2 to tetragonal-ZrO 2. It was evidenced that both powders remained <b>nanocrystalline</b> after all <b>processing</b> steps with the average particle sizes from 8 to 20 nm.

40|$|By {{the method}} of IR-heating the {{precursor}} on base of polyacrylonitrile, compounds of iron, cobalt and nickel metal-carbon nanocomposites were obtained, representing an ensemble of nanoparticles of intermetallic FeCo (NiCo), dispersed in nanocrystalline carbon matrix. XRD analysis revealed that the carbon structure of the PAN-based matrix changed from amorphous to <b>nanocrystalline</b> at the <b>processing</b> temperatures in the range 200 - 700 °C. Thus there is a reduction of metals from compounds released by degradation of the polymer with hydro-gen. FeCo alloy nanoparticles formed at synthesis temperatures T≥ 500 °C, {{in the case of}} nanocomposites Ni-Co / C alloy nanoparticle formation is possible at T ≥ 270 °C, which is associated with a lower temperature com-pared to the recovery of nickel from iron. According to the results of TGA and DSC found that metals are capable of initiating the chemical transformation in the PAN, resulting in reduction start temperature degradation. Ac-cording to the results of DSC revealed that the formation of nanoparticles is accompanied by release of heat due to exothermic processes occurring in the nanocomposites.

40|$|Nanocrystalline {{cellulose}} (NCC) {{has great}} {{potential as a}} reinforcing agent in thermoplastics (such as polyesters, polyamides and polycarbonates) due to its high mechanical strength and aspect ratio – being compared with reinforcements like steel and carbon nanotubes. In order to maintain its strength when compounded with thermoplastics, the high-temperature processing must not damage the structural integrity of the <b>nanocrystalline</b> cellulose. The <b>processing</b> temperature for polyesters, polyamides and polycarbonates is relatively high and near to the onset of thermal degradation of cellulose bio products, therefore {{care must be taken}} to ensure the preservation of the structural integrity of nanocrystalline cellulose. The thermal stability and the kinetics of thermal degradation of five different cellulose samples were studied using an Ozawa-Flynn-Wall method and thermogravimetric analysis data. To complete the characterization of the NCC for polymer processing applications, the crystallinity index was determined using X-ray diffraction; surface morphology was studied with scanning electron microscope, chemical composition was studied using FT-IR, and moisture content was measured using a moisture analyser. Each of these properties observed is essential to the end mechanical properties of the polymer nanocomposite as these properties will affect the dispersion and interfacial adhesion of the fibres to the polymer matrix. After a complete investigation of the cellulose reinforcements, a procedure was developed for dispersion of the NCC fibres into a polycarbonate matrix followed by the moulding of specimen bars. The mechanical properties of the five cellulose-polycarbonate nanocomposites – for example, tensile modulus, flexural modulus and impact strength – were tested and compared to the homo-polycarbonate. The motivation for this project was to design a new material for use as strong, lightweight window substitute; an alternative to conventional residential/commercial windows and a lightweight alternative to conventional automotive glass, offering increased fuel efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents studies {{directed towards}} the design, characterization and analysis, of bulk nanostructured (BN) and bimodal aluminum alloy 5083 (AA 5083) fabricated by cold spray processing (CSP). The {{results of the}} CSP samples were compared to the microstructures and properties of BN materials obtained using conventional powder consolidation techniques. Additionally, a proprietary non-cryogenic ball milling (NCM) technique was evaluated as a more cost effective alternative to cryogenic ball milling (CM) for <b>processing</b> <b>nanocrystalline</b> powder. Motivating factors for this research include the degradation of mechanical strength {{as a result of}} long term exposure of the nanocrystalline powder to elevated temperatures during conventional hot-processing techniques, removal of residual surface oxide that can prevent full density of the final product, and a more time and cost effective means of producing BN materials. CSP is an advantageous alternative to conventional bulk powder processing techniques as it is a low-temperature, high-velocity spray deposition technique that has been found to retain, if not further refine, the microstructure of the deposited powder, is capable of breaking up surface oxide resulting in clean metal bonding, and is capable of producing near-net-shape parts that require little post processing to achieve a final product. Furthermore, the NCM process does not use liquid nitrogen during milling operations, which results in significant cost savings compared to CM. It was found that the nanocrystalline powders produced using the NCM process were comparable in size, morphology, and grain size to the nanocrystalline powders developed using CM. It was further determined that NCM AA 5083 exhibited a higher average hardness and potentially higher thermal stability compared to CM AA 5083. These results indicate that NCM is as effective as CM in developing nanocrystalline microstructures. Analysis of the bulk CSP samples revealed that the average grain size was smaller compared to BN materials fabricated using conventional techniques, and also exhibited a higher hardness. The tensile strength of the CSP samples was found to be low compared to the conventionally processed counterparts and is attributed to the presence of microstructural defects arising from incomplete particle bonding. Analysis of bimodal bulk CSP AA 5083 revealed that the intended bimodal microstructure was not retained as the conventional grain sized powder undergoes significant grain refinement during deposition. Though areas of ductile failure were observed in the fracture surfaces, an overall lack of ductility and strength was found and attributed again to microstructural defects. These findings suggest that CSP is a viable alternative for processing BN materials...|$|R
