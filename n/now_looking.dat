5|$|Black {{tracks the}} history of the second kidnapper, finding that he was {{involved}} in a military medical group; Swan's name is also associated with this group. As Black is investigating, Watts approaches him, showing him a second photograph of Taylor, <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> sickly, beside the canister. Watts believes she has less than two days to live. Meanwhile, Hollis has discovered that Swan frequently called Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM radio show under a pseudonym to discuss conspiracy theories about Gulf War syndrome. Bell invites Black onto the show to speak to a listening Swan; the two realise that Black's wife was killed by a pathogen Swan was ordered to test on his troops during the Gulf War—an order which came from a group outside of the Army.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the New Jersey Department of Transportation {{introduced}} {{a case study}} for Route31 for its New Jersey: Future in Transportation project. Over time, the residents and business owners of Raritan Township and Flemington had growing concerns over the congestion along the highway and US202. After trying to use vacant land {{to the east of}} the current alignment, the Department of Transportation put forth the Flemington Bypass, trying to relieve congestion on Route31 along the commercial district and to provide access to the industrial land between the two highways and the South Branch River. The project was never completed and the proposed site remains undeveloped. The Department of Transportation is <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> at a scaled-down bypass, proposed as the South Branch Parkway, to connect Route31 to US202 in Flemington.|$|E

25|$|The Palestinian Interior Ministry raised {{doubts about}} the claims, {{and said that they}} {{believed}} that Johnston was still being held by someone else, and this declaration was an attempt to pressure the Palestinian government.

The P2s share around 70% of components used on Tornado. It will be made after the A1 Trust has enough money for Tornado future overhaul and debts repaid. Once work on the P2 is complete, the trust will start construction on a new V4 followed by a new V3.|$|E
25|$|By this time, the Navy {{had decided}} the F-111 would not meet their requirements, and began {{development}} of a new dedicated fighter design, the VFAX program. In May 1966, McNamara again asked the forces to study the designs and see whether the VFAX would meet the Air Force's F-X needs. The resulting studies took 18 months and concluded that the desired features were too different; the Navy stressed loiter time and mission flexibility, while the Air Force was <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> primarily for maneuverability.|$|E

25|$|The club {{finished}} {{the season in}} eighth position, which would remain their highest placing for the next fourteen years, and had managed to attract relatively large attendances to Raikes Hall. One year later, however, that all changed when they announced a loss of £1,183. The club had started with capital of around £2,000, but the players' wages amounted to almost exactly three-quarters of that total. With attendance numbers declining {{to an average of}} two thousand, the club's financial position, which had once been healthy, was <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> bleak.|$|E

25|$|Walking {{for normal}} able bodied {{children}} is {{a lot different than}} walking for below-knee-amputees. Walking is less fluid and symmetrical for the children who are amputees. Research was conducted in order to find {{the best way to get}} the amputee children to develop a more symmetrical and fluid walking form like normal able bodied children. Because of the results of the study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers are <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up a new idea or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E
25|$|Raleigh-Durham has {{finished}} {{most of its}} construction with {{the completion of the}} Terminal 1 renovation, leading the airport to have the proper infrastructure until 2040. Nevertheless, the airport still owns nearly 2000 acres of unused land around the airport that it wants to develop. Some ideas for developing that land include an airport hotel or warehouse facilities. For air service, the airport is looking at several domestic destinations including Portland and San Diego for new non-stop air service. With the addition of the Paris flight, Raleigh is <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> into a transpacific flight, possibly to somewhere in India, the Middle East or China where companies such as Lenovo have frequent business flights.|$|E
25|$|With Phase one {{funding and}} {{construction}} underway, Metro pushed to accelerate phase 2. On January 4, 2017, {{the second phase}} of the Purple Line subway, which will connect Beverly Hills and Century City to Downtown Los Angeles by rail, received more than $1.6 billion in federal grants and loans. The federal money, in combination with $747 million in local sales tax revenue, gives the Metropolitan Transportation Authority enough funding to begin construction on the next phase of the long-awaited rail project along the route. Both phases are under construction and Metro is <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> for funding on phase three (UCLA and VA Stations) and for the Federal government (Trump Administration) from keeping funding away that was previously granted by the Obama Administration.|$|E

25|$|The {{bargaining}} atmosphere deteriorated {{throughout the}} remainder of 1992. The state's chief negotiator said he would wait for the legislative fact-finding panel's recommendation, Shafer implied he might oppose a proposed bond measure which would help fund state jobs, and Shafer accused the governor of releasing private confidential negotiating information to PEF members without the union's consent. At PEF's convention in October 1992, Members United for a Responsible Union leafletted against Shafer, accused him of neglecting members' needs and trying {{to curry favor with}} the AFT. Although the legislature passed a mandatory binding arbitration bill, the governor vetoed the legislation. <b>Now</b> <b>looking</b> at two years without a new contract, Shafer hired Theodore W. Kheel, a well-known labor negotiator, to help the union win a new pact.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have looked}} at, {{and some have}} even optimized, {{protocols}} for testing for various issues, including non-compatible RhD factors, sex determination for X-linked genetic disorders and testing for single gene disorders. Current studies are <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> at determining aneuploidies in the developing fetus. These protocols can be done earlier than the current prenatal testing methods, and have no risk of spontaneous abortion, unlike current prenatal testing methods. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) and Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) have been implemented in the UK {{and parts of the}} US; it has clear benefits above the standard tests of chorionic villi sample (CVS), amniocentesis, and other techniques which have procedure-related miscarriage risks of about 1 in 100 pregnancies and 1 in 200 pregnancies, respectively.|$|E

Bryant told Larner he had been surfing and had bought a property called Fogg Lodge and was <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> to buy some cattle from Larner. Bryant also made several comments about buying the Martins' place next door. He asked if Marian Larner was home, {{and asked if he}} could continue down the driveway of the farm to see her.
