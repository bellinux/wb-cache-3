5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is that its gravity is <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to oppose it.|$|E
5|$|Despite the modifications, it was {{realized}} that the walls of Valletta were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to withstand a long siege. In 1635, construction of the Floriana Lines commenced, enclosing Valletta's land front. The Floriana Lines were also modified until the 18th century. Later on, the suburb of Floriana developed in the area between the Floriana Lines and the Valletta Land Front, {{and it is now}} a town in its own right.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people believe}} the urban myth that the daddy longlegs Opiliones {{have the most}} {{poisonous}} bite in the spider world, but that the fangs {{are too small to}} penetrate human skin. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and definitely <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to break human skin.|$|E
5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the beast are rare, {{as it is}} not {{generally considered to be}} a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough.</b> Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E

5|$|The British {{had been}} alerted to Arnold's {{approach}} and had destroyed {{all of the}} boats on the river's southern banks. Although two warships, the frigate Lizard (26 guns) and the sloop-of-war Hunter (16 guns), kept up a constant patrol to prevent a river crossing, Arnold was able to procure sufficient watercraft for his men, and crossed to the Quebec City side on November 11. He then realized his force was <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to capture the city, so he retreated several miles and waited for Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|The city of Valletta {{was founded}} on 28 March 1566 by Jean de Valette, the Grand Master of the Order of St. John. The city {{occupied}} about half the Sciberras Peninsula, a large promontory separating the Grand Harbour from Marsamxett Harbour, and was protected by tracce italiane fortifications, including a land front with four bastions, two cavaliers and a deep ditch. Although these fortifications were well designed, by the early 17th century they were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to resist a large attack due to new technological developments which increased the range of artillery.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} the Italian Navy's modern battleships, the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class were smaller than their contemporaries due to {{limitations}} imposed by the Italian government and indecision in the naval design staff over what kind of battleship should be built. They were designed {{under the supervision of}} Admiral Simone di Pacoret Saint Bon, the namesake of the lead ship, and Benedetto Brin. Ultimately, the ships' small size, weak main battery, and slow speed made them ineffective capital ships, since they were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to engage foreign battleships, and too slow to catch cruisers.|$|E

The second prototype crashed on 25 March 1945 when the pilot failed to recover from a dive from , probably also due to compressibility effects. The third prototype crashed on 5 April when the canopy blew off during a high-speed pass over Lindbergh Field.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture {{feeds on}} carrion and locates {{carcasses}} by sight and by smell, an ability which {{is rare in}} birds. It is dependent on larger vultures, such as the king vulture, to open the hides of larger animal carcasses, as its bill is <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to do this. Like other New World vultures, the greater yellow-headed vulture utilizes thermals to stay aloft with minimal effort. It lays its eggs on flat surfaces, such as the floors of caves, or in the hollows of stumps. It feeds its young by regurgitation.|$|E

5|$|Under Venetian rule, a small harbour {{was built}} in Rethymno, which became the third most {{important}} city on Crete after Heraklion and Chania. On 8 April 1540, a line of fortifications began to be built around the city. The walls were designed by the architect Michele Sanmicheli, and were completed in around 1570. These fortifications were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to withstand a large assault, and when Uluç Ali Reis attacked in 1571, the Ottomans captured and sacked the city.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of new technologies, by the 17th century it was realised that while Valletta's fortifications were well designed, they were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to withstand a heavy attack. Because of this, the Floriana Lines, encircling Valletta's original land front, were built from 1635 to the 1640s. In the 18th century, a suburb developed between the Floriana Lines and Valletta's land front, and it became known as Floriana, today a town in its own right.|$|E

He had violated his written orders by sailing to Nassau instead of Virginia and the Carolinas, {{and he had}} distributed the goods taken during the cruise to Connecticut and Rhode Island without consulting Congress. He was censured for these transgressions, and dismissed from the Navy in January 1778 after further controversies, including the fleet's failure to sail agayn (a number of its ships suffered from crew shortages, and also became trapped at Providence by the British occupation of Newport late in 1776). American forces were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to dislodge the British garrison there, which was also supported by British ships using Newport as a base.|$|E

5|$|In the Battle of Neresheim (11 August 1796), Hotze {{commanded}} 13 battalions and 28 cavalry squadrons, a {{total of}} 13,300 men, and formed the center of Archduke Charles' line. Although Hotze's force managed to push the French out of several villages, his force was <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> {{to follow up on}} his advantage. Following the action at Neresheim, his force participated in the joint battles of Neumarkt and Lauf, followed by the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September 1796. During these consecutive actions, Hotze's organization and initiative led to the overwhelming of the French lines. For his actions in this campaign, he was awarded a promotion on 29 April 1797, and received the Commander's Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that {{when the universe was}} young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to explain the present baryon asymmetry.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{fortress}} had been captured, Murad placed his own garrison of Janissaries and ordered {{his men to}} repair the walls. Perlati and his soldiers came to Skanderbeg, begging for mercy.

Skanderbeg continued to shadow the Ottoman army as it headed back home in the hopes of dealing some serious damage, but his forces were <b>not</b> <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to risk provoking them. In October of the same year, Murad managed to inflict a serious a defeat on John Hunyadi's forces in Kosovo. Skanderbeg had planned to join Hunyadi's offensive with 20,000 men, but he was not able to get there in time due to Đurađ Branković blocking the roads to Kosovo.|$|E
