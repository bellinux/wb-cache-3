The traditional beliefs held by economists that perfectly competitive markets are the most efficient may not be true in all the layers of this emerging <b>network</b> <b>economy.</b> We discuss the market structures and competition in different layers of the <b>network</b> <b>economy</b> and the roles of the government in coordinating economic interests of these segments...|$|R

This resemblance presents a unique perspective on global economic development. Innovation {{can and should be}} combined with high ethical, social and environmental standards. This is illustrated by empirical data on Hidden Champions in Europe: middlesized companies that are dominant in their specific market niches.

40|$|This {{research}} examines investment behavior within industries {{characterized by}} <b>network</b> <b>economies.</b> That is, industries {{in which the}} value of a product to consumers increases with the number of other consumers that purchase compatible products. I analyze indirect <b>network</b> <b>economies</b> by investigating the ability of firms, producing complementary products, to coordinate investment decisions over time. I also investigate the influence of direct <b>network</b> <b>economies</b> on the quantity-setting strategies of a durable good monopolist. When networks are present an incumbent technology has an advantage over an entrant, due to the value consumers place on an installed network of compatibility. This network can hinder the adoption of an innovation. Within industries characterized by indirect networks, strategic interdependencies exist as firms, who produce complementary products, invest in innovative technologies. Diffusion of innovations requires coordination, so that a new product might appear on the market accompanied by a minimal network of compatible complementary products. Game theoretic techniques are used to model this coordination process as it evolves over time. To determine if observed behavior is consistent with Nash refinements of selection among Pareto-rankable Nash equilibrium paths, economic experiments were conducted. The experimental data reveals that in a time-dependent multi-stage coordination game, subjects are unable to focus on the Pareto-dominant Nash equilibrium (PDNE) strategy path. However, given repetition subjects converge toward it. The data show that a higher cost of exiting the existing technology or a higher level of strategic uncertainty decreases the level of coordination on the PDNE strategy path. I also investigate the impact of a network parameter on a durable good monopolist's quantity-setting strategies. This two-period model reveals that the presence of <b>network</b> <b>economies</b> increases prices in both periods. Thus, the monopolist's profits increase relative to a model without <b>network</b> <b>economies.</b> Finally, I discuss how the combination of durability and <b>network</b> <b>economies</b> affect investment in incompatible product upgrades. When <b>network</b> <b>economies</b> exist, a firm must anticipate the interdependencies and uncertainties that exist among consumers. Thus, if sufficient demand for product quality exists relative to demand for network benefits, diffusion of the innovation should occur...|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>networked</b> <b>economy</b> is {{a result}} of the {{increasing}} specialization and productivity. The blurring of company boundaries enables potential for new competitive advantages. However, along with the growing <b>networked</b> <b>economy,</b> the complexity also increases. 	Methods: With their current study the German logistics association sheds a light on the most important trends of the networked and complex economy and the strategies of logistics and supply chain management (SCM) coping with them. 	Results and conclusions: This paper focuses on the collaboration of actors in logistics and supply chain management and the communication required for being successful. Furthermore, going beyond the study, the role of collaboration for innovation in logistics and SCM is considered, that has been neglected in literature so far. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion reflecting the current state of collaboration in the context of its potential...|$|E
