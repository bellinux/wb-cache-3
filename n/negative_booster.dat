25|$|In the USSR, {{the power}} supply system of an {{electric}} railroad is {{closely tied to the}} overall power system. Electricity arrives from substations in high-voltage power transmission lines, is converted, and then transmitted over feed and <b>negative</b> <b>booster</b> lines to the contact system and then to the rolling stock. Depending on the equipment in the rolling stock, the power may be supplied over DC systems using single-phase systems at the commercial frequency (50 hertz) or lower (16 2/3 or 25Hz). The DC systems in the USSR had a nominal voltage of 3 kilovolts. In 1956, the Central Committee of the Soviet Union adopted the General Plan for the Electrification of Railroads - after which major rail routes were upgraded.|$|E
40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{start-up}} {{time of a}} crystal oscillator (XO), a chirp injection (CI) and a <b>negative</b> resistance <b>booster</b> (NRB) are proposed. By combining CI and NRB, the measured start-up time of a 39 -MHz XO in 180 -nm CMOS is reduced by 92 % from 2. 1 ms to 158 μs, which is the shortest time in the published XO’s. The measured start-up time variations due to the ± 20 % supply voltage change or the temperature change are less than 13 %...|$|R
40|$|Persistence of {{hepatitis}} B vaccine immune protection {{and response to}} hepatitis B booster immunization * LI Hui 1, LI Rong-Cheng 2, LIAO Su-Su 1, YANG Jin-Ye 2, ZENG Xian-Jia 1, WANG Shu-Sheng 2 Subject headings hepatitis B vaccines; immune protection persistence; booster; immunization AIM To identify the persistence of immune protection of China-made, plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine after infancy immunization and the time table of booster immunization. METHODS A cross-sectional follow-up study and an experimental study on booster {{were used for the}} evaluation of the serological effect 7 years after vaccination and the antibody anamnestic response. Radioimmunoassay was used for the detection {{of hepatitis}} B virus markers. RESULTS The protective anti-HBs positive rates of 1018 children, who were vaccinated according to the regimen of three doses of 10 µg hepatitis B vaccine in their infancy, declined from 75. 0 % during the first two years to 48. 2 % in the 7 th year after the first dosage, however, the positive rates for HBsAg and anti-HBc always fluctuated at a low frequency. A total of 144 subjects aged 6 or 7 years, who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBc before booster, were selected from 1018 children of the follow-up study, and boosted with 1 µg intradermally or 2 µg hypodermically hepatitis B vaccines. Their anti-HBs GMT and anti-HBs positive rates were 190. 6 mIU/ml and 89. 6 % in the first month after booster, significantly higher than 14. 7 mIU/ml and 54. 9 % before booster (P < 0. 01), and declined back to 25. 3 mIU/ml and 75. 5 % in the 12 th month; among 65 children with the anti-HBs <b>negative</b> before <b>booster,</b> 40 had a level of anti-HBS 100 mIU/ml one month after booster, suggesting retention of immune memory in most of them. CONCLUSION No need for revaccination against hepatitis B in the 7 th year after the initial immunization due to better persistence of immune protection of the vaccine and retention of immune memory to hepatitis B virus {{in the vast majority of}} the vaccinees...|$|R
40|$|Precious few and {{practically}} all: the modification of absolute and relative quantifiers There {{is a long}} tradition of research into the modification of adjectives, as in very pretty and almost full (e. g. Paradis 2001). By contrast, little focused attention has gone to the modification of quantifiers, as in very few and almost all. As part of a larger project aimed at filling this gap, we present a corpus-based study of the modification of (a) few and all. Quantification can be described in terms of two basic types: absolute and relative quantification (Milsark 1977, Langacker 1991). Absolute quantifiers measure the size of some set or mass with reference to an implied scale with(schematic) measure units, e. g. (a) few, many/much, etc. Relative quantifiers compare the size of the actually designated mass or set to a reference mass/set, indicating whether or not the two coincide, and if not, to what extent they don’t, e. g. NO, SOME, most, all. We hypothesize that the semantic distinction between absolute and relative quantifiers determines the different types of modification found with them. With absolute quantifiers, modifiers operate on the ‘range’ indicated on the scale, which they ‘upscale’ (boost), e. g. very many, or ‘downscale’ (compromise or minimize), e. g. rather a lot. This upscaling or downscaling effect interacts with the positive or negative scalar direction inherent in the quantifier. Thus, with positive a few, we predict that boosters will enlarge the quantity (1 a) and downscaling modifiers reduce it (1 b). Conversely, with <b>negative</b> few, <b>boosters</b> will further reduce the quantity (2 a) while minimizers will soften the paucity meaning of the quantifier (2 b). (1) 	a. 	I got offered quite a few bad guys in American movies (WB) 	b. 	Whenever swaths of women are congregated in just a few types of job (WB) (2) 	a. 	Then look at the precious few victories (WB) 	b. 	When they look at senior women in their organisations they cannot help but notice that rather few of them have rich family lives. (WB) With relative quantifiers, modifiers operate on the (non-) coincidence with the reference mass indicated. With all they indicate that the quantity designated does indeed coincide with the reference mass/set (maximizer), e. g. absolutely all (3 a), or differs somewhat from it (approximator), e. g. practically all (3 b), thus mitigating the universal quantification that all designates on its own. (3) 	a. 	if absolutely all other options fail. (WB) 	b. 	disabled secretaries can do practically all office jobs. (WB) We also investigate the hitherto largely neglected possibility of a marked relative reading being imposed on absolute quantifiers so that the quantity they indicate is construed in relation to a reference mass (Milsark 1977), as in (4), where (stressed) a FEW is equivalent to relative SOME, indicating that the actual set differs considerably from the reference set of all ten candidate countries. We will investigate the restrictions on these marked uses of (a) few, hypothesizing that they exclude certain purely scalar modifiers such as very. (4) 	If only a few, but not all ten candidate countries, are ready by December (WB) We will verify the above hypotheses by qualitative and quantitative analysis of large datasets extracted from the Times subcorpus of WordbanksOnline. For (a) few an exhaustive extraction of 19, 965 was made, of which 1968, i. e. roughly 10 %, had quantity modification. For all a random sample of 20, 000 was taken, of which only 208, about 1 %, was modified. We will also relate our findings to the analogy proposed by Author 3 and 2 (2011) between the degree modification of unbounded and bounded adjectives and the quantity modification of absolute and relative quantifiers. In this context, we will investigate to what extent Quirk et al. ’s (1985) subclasses of ‘amplifiers’ and ‘downtoners’ correspond to our ‘upscalers’ and ‘downscalers’ of quantity modification.
