Hence low-cost parts will not be achievable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} and {{apparatus}} for the fabrication of high-quality, near <b>net</b> <b>shaped</b> aluminum alloy billets is {{developed by the}} combination of continuous casting and electromagnetic casting/stirring technique. Traditional machine for continuous casting process involves round, square and rectangular billets; therefore it requires additional multistep forging process to fabricate final products of complicated shape. A new process for the fabrication of near <b>net</b> <b>shaped</b> aluminum billets offers some advantages: the process of extrusion and forging is simplified {{and the cost of}} plastic working can be greatly reduced. In order to reduce the peculiar problems such as surface crack and internal defect due to inhomogeneous heat transfer of solidified billets, electromagnetic casting and stirring technique were adopted. The effect of electromagnetic field was compared by observing the microstructure of billets. Grain refinement of aluminum billet was clearly observed by applying electromagnetic field to continuous casting process...|$|R

Compared to other casting processes such as die casting or sand casting, it can be an expensive process. However, the components that can be produced using investment casting can incorporate intricate contours, and in most cases the components are cast near <b>net</b> <b>shape,</b> so require little or no rework once cast.|$|E
