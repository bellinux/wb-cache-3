In 1995, {{she worked with}} her brother on the comedy Augustin. Two years later, she wrote and {{directed}} the successful Dry Cleaning (<b>Nettoyage</b> à Sec).

As of 2010, the hospital had 210 employees, the high school (200 employees), the commune (130 employees) and the middle school (80 employees). The private sector is primarily represented by the Leclerc Center (120 employees) and the industrial zone enterprises; Celec (40 salaried employees), Mecanolav Ridel (40 salaried employees), Grosse Équipement and Peltier <b>Nettoyage</b> (more than 30 employees each), followed by Maison Régionale de l'Eau (MRE), Poxblanc Charpentes, Bastéa Constructeur, Guerard (20 jobs each), and many other artisanal, commercial, and small enterprises.|$|E
5000|$|In French, nouns {{ending in}} -e {{tend to be}} feminine, whereas others tend to be masculine, {{but there are many}} {{exceptions}} to this (e.g. cadre, arbre, signe, meuble, nuage are masculine as façon, chanson, voix, main, eau are feminine). Certain suffixes are quite reliable indicators, such as -age, which when added to a verb (e.g. garer [...] "to park" [...] -> garage; nettoyer [...] "to clean" [...] -> <b>nettoyage</b> [...] "cleaning") indicates a masculine noun; however, when -age is part of the root of the word, it can be feminine, as in plage ("beach") or image. On the other hand, nouns ending in -tion, -sion and -aison are all feminine.|$|E
50|$|Modern dry cleaning's use of non-water-based {{solvents}} {{to remove}} soil and stains from clothes was reported {{as early as}} 1855. The potential for petroleum-based solvents was recognized by French dye-works operator Jean Baptiste Jolly, who offered a new service that became known as <b>nettoyage</b> à sec—i.e., dry cleaning. Flammability concerns led William Joseph Stoddard, a dry cleaner from Atlanta, to develop Stoddard solvent (white spirit) as a slightly less flammable alternative to gasoline-based solvents. The use of highly flammable petroleum solvents caused many fires and explosions, resulting in government regulation of dry cleaners. After World War I, dry cleaners began using chlorinated solvents. These solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power.|$|E

Various cleaning materials and methods are available, but in making a selection consideration must be given {{not only to the}} effectiveness of the method but also to the hazards involved and to possible adverse effects.

Arthroscopyof the right knee revealed a medial meniscus lesion and patellary chondropathy. <b>Nettoyage</b> and partial meniscectomy was performed. Because of per-sistent pain, he was referred to the nuclearmedicine department for a technetium- 99 m bone scintigraphy. Ten to 15 minutes post injection, bloodpool images (Fig 1 A) showed increased focal perfusion of the radionuclide in the bone marrow of both humeral heads, in the trochanter region of both hips, distally in both femora, and proximally in both tibiae. These results suggested active inflammation or malignancy in the bone marrow at these sites. Anterior and posterior whole-body delayed images of th...|$|E

40|$|Consider a set {{of mobile}} robots with minimal {{capabilities}} placed over distinct nodes of a discrete anonymous ring. They operate {{on the basis of}} the so called Look-Compute-Move cycle. Asynchronously, each robot takes a snapshot of the ring, determining which nodes are either occupied by robots or empty. Based on the observed configuration, it decides whether to move to one of its adjacent nodes or to stay idle. In the first case, it performs the computed move, eventually. The computation also depends on the required task. In this paper, we solve both the well-known Searching and Gathering tasks. In the literature, most contributions are restricted to a subset of initial configurations. Here, we design two different algorithms and provide a full characterization of the initial configurations that permit the resolution of the problems under minimal assumptions. Nous considérons un ensemble de robots mobiles qui sont placés sur distincts sommets d'un réseau en anneau. Le réseau est anonyme et les robots ont des aptitudes minimales. Ils opérent par des cycles Observer-Calculer-Bouger. Nous résolvons les problémes de la réunion et du <b>nettoyage</b> de graphe dans ce modéle...|$|E
