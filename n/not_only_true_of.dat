6000|$|Let me cite another more {{grotesque}} {{piece of}} irrelevancy {{with a similar}} drift. Some months ago the present writer chanced to express an opinion upon Welsh Disestablishment. Wales, at any rate, {{would seem to be}} far enough away from Emile, Candide, the Law of Prairial, and the Committee of Public Safety. The Times, however, instantly said[1] that it would be affectation to express any surprise, because my unfortunate [...] "theories and principles, drawn from French sources and framed on French models, all tend to the disintegration of comprehensive political organisations and the encouragement of arrangements based on the minor peculiarities of race or dialect." [...] Was there ever in the world such prodigious nonsense? What French sources, what French models? If French models point in any one direction rather than another, it is away from disintegration and straight towards centralisation. Everybody knows {{that this is one of}} the most notorious facts of French history from the days of Lewis XI. or Cardinal Richelieu down to Napoleon Bonaparte. So far from French models encouraging [...] "arrangements based on the minor peculiarities of race and dialect," [...] France is the first great example in modern history, for good or for evil, of a persevering process of national unification, and the firm suppression of all provincial particularismus. This is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> French political leaders in general: it is particularly true of the Jacobin leaders. Rousseau himself, I admit, did in one place point in the direction of confederation; but only in the sense that for freedom on the one hand, and just administration on the other, the unit should not be too large to admit of the participation of the persons concerned in the management of their own public affairs. If the Jacobins had not been overwhelmed by the necessity of keeping out the invaders, they might have developed the germ of truth in Rousseau's loose way of stating the expediency of decentralisation. As it was, above all other French schools, the Jacobins dealt most sternly with particularist pretensions. Of all men, these supposed masters, teachers, and models of mine are least to be called Separatists. To them more than to any other of the revolutionary parties the great heresy of Federalism was most odious; and if I were a faithful follower of the Jacobin model, I should have least patience with nationalist sentiment whether in Ireland, Scotland, or Wales, and should most rigorously insist on that cast-iron incorporation which, as it happens, in the case of Ireland I believe to be equally hopeless and undesirable. This explanation, therefore, of my favour for Welsh Disestablishment is as absurdly ignorant as it is far-fetched and irrelevant.|$|E

60|$|It {{remains to}} speak of what I wrote during these years, which, {{independently}} of my contributions to newspapers, was considerable. In 1830 and 1831 I wrote the five Essays since published under the title of Essays on some Unsettled Questions of political Economy, almost as they now stand, except that in 1833 I partially rewrote the fifth Essay. They were written with no immediate purpose of publication; and when, some years later, I offered them to a publisher, he declined them. They were only printed in 1844, after {{the success of the}} System of Logic. I also resumed my speculations on this last subject, and puzzled myself, like others before me, with the great paradox of the discovery of new truths by general reasoning. As to the fact, there could be no doubt. As little could it be doubted, that all reasoning is resolvable into syllogisms, and that in every syllogism the conclusion is actually contained and implied in the premises. How, being so contained and implied, it could be new truth, and how the theorems of geometry, so different in appearance from the definitions and axioms, could be all contained in these, was a difficulty which no, one, I thought, had sufficiently felt, and which, at all events, no one had succeeded in clearing up. The explanations offered by Whately and others, though they might give a temporary satisfaction, always, in my mind, left a mist still hanging over the subject. At last, when reading a second or third time the chapters on Reasoning in the second volume of Dugald Stewart, interrogating myself on every point, and following out, as far as I knew how, every topic of thought which the book suggested, I came upon an idea of his respecting the use of axioms in ratiocination, which I did not remember to have before noticed, but which now, in meditating on it, seemed to me <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> axioms, but of all general propositions whatever, and to be the key of the whole perplexity. From this germ grew the theory of the Syllogism propounded in the Second Book of the Logic; which I immediately fixed by writing it out. And now, with greatly increased hope of being able to produce a work on Logic, of some originality and value, I proceeded to write the First Book, from the rough and imperfect draft I had already made. What I now wrote became the basis of that part of the subsequent Treatise; except that it did not contain the Theory of Kinds, which was a later addition, suggested by otherwise inextricable difficulties which met me in my first attempt to work out the subject of some of the concluding chapters of the Third Book. At the point which I had now reached I made a halt, which lasted five years. I had {{come to the end of}} my tether; I could make nothing satisfactory of Induction, at this time. I continued to read any book which seemed to promise light on the subject, and appropriated, as well as I could, the results; but for a long time I found nothing which seemed to open to me any very important vein of meditation.|$|E

This work, submitting the original with infinite tenderness and feeling, was painted in 1896 in the Dulwich Gallery and was consecrated by Bishop de Goesbriand for the service of Saint Augustine's Church on July 26, 1897. The essential force of this sacred painting is its actual power to impress the beholder with {{a profound sense of}} the sacredness of motherhood and the worth and lasting values of purity and religious faith.

5000|$|The spiritual is the essence, {{the martial}} is the application. Spiritual {{development}} {{in the realm of}} martial arts is applied through the ching (metabolic energy), ch'i (breath energy) and shen (spiritual energy) - the practise of physical culture. When the martial is matched with the spiritual and it is experienced in the body and mind, this then is the practise of martial arts. With the spiritual and martial we must speak of [...] "firing time," [...] for their development unfolds according to the proper sequence. This is the root of physical culture. Therefore, the practise of the martial arts in a spiritual way is soft-style exercise, the sinew power of ching, ch'i and shen. When the martial arts are practical in an exclusively martial way, this is hard style, or simply brute force. The spiritual without martial training is essence without application; the martial without spiritual accompaniment is application without essence. A lone pole cannot stand, a single palm cannot clap. This is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> physical culture and martial arts, but all things are subject to this principle. The spiritual is internal principle; the martial is external skill. External skill without internal principle is simply physical ferocity. This {{is a far cry from}} the original nature of the art, and by bullying an opponent one eventually invites disaster. To understand the internal principles without the external skill is simply an armchair art. Without knowing the applications, one will be lost in an actual confrontation. When it comes to applying this art, one cannot afford to ignore the significance of the two words: spiritual and martial.|$|E

As a consequence the company was not as widely known as some other insurers of comparable size who undertook more mass marketing.

His point is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the classical Greek output, but of a contemporary adolescent fantasy saga, Riordan’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians (2006 – 2011), which retells many of the classical Greek mythological narratives in a contemporary setting. Given that many adolescent audiences may be unfamiliar with the root narratives, the Percy Jackson and the Olympians saga serves the function of re-introducing an audience to classical mythology, thereby helping them to rediscover their value. This article argues that by skilfully adapting and appropriating the monomythic hero-journeys of Greek mythology, and by retelling them within a contemporary narrative, Riordan is creating a space where readers, possibly unfamiliar with the root classical narratives, can re-discover classical mythology.

I will first suggest that the type of relational gestures inculcated through literature over the past centuries should be analyzed in close connection with the development of political economy.

40|$|Labour {{market policy}} always had and {{continues}} to have an indisputable role in the transformation process in eastern Germany - complementary to the diverse efforts of economic and structural policy {{in dealing with the}} structural breakdown and creating new jobs. It has not only eased the pressure on the labour market rapidly and to a considerable extent, and provided individuals with new employment prospects; it has also been confronted with structural polity expectations more than ever before in western Germany and in the process has also been overtaxed - sometimes having to fend for itself - in view of the dimensions of the radical transformation. Major job creating measures of relevance from a structural policy aspect occurred. The development was deliberately reinforced institutionally by the introduction of employment and structural development companies and instrumentally above all by the flat-rate employment subsidy in accordance with § 249 h 1 of the Employment Promotion Act. Uncertain prospects for the future impeded the realistic training striven for, but also led in many places to new approaches using training to support or even to initiate small business set-ups or redevelopment work. Without labour market policy assistance, the economic restart in many parts of eastern Germany {{would not have been able}} to take place so rapidly, although labour market policy can only contribute to the structural change and the creation of permanent jobs, but can not bring these about of its own accord. Many restrictions which stand in the way of a more extensive linking of the political fields still remain. The structural policy potentials of labour market policy in eastern Germany have not been and certainly will not be drained, but they have been developed further and sight must be not lost of them. In view of many remaining uncertainties, especially with regard to the structural policy effect of measures, evaluations based on causal analysis seem to be necessary on a larger scale than previously to supplement the descriptive analyses on which this elaboration largely had to be based.

40|$|The Children’s Book Council of Australia (CBCA) {{administers the}} oldest {{national}} prize for children’s literature in Australia. Each year, the CBCA confers “Book of the Year” awards to literature {{for young people}} in five categories. In 2001, {{the establishment of an}} “Early Childhood” category opened up the venerable “Picture Book” category (first awarded in 1955) to books with an implied readership up to 18 years of age. As a result, this category has emerged in recent years as a highly visible space within which the CBCA can contest discourses of cultural marginalisation insofar as Australian (“colonial”) literature is constructed as inferior or adjunct to the major Anglophone literary traditions, and the consistent identification of children’s literature (and, indeed, of children) as lesser than its ‘adult’ counterparts. The CBCA is engaged in defining, evaluating, and legitimising a tradition of Australian children’s literature which is underpinned by a canonical impulse, and is a reflexive practice of self-definition, self-evaluation and self-legitimisation for the CBCA itself. While it is obviously problematic to identify award winners as a canon, it is equally obvious that literary prizing is a cultural practice derived from the logic of canonicity. In his discussion of the United States’s Newbery Medal, Kenneth Kidd notes that “Medal books are instant classics, the selection process an ostensible simulation of the test of time” (169) and that “the Medal is part of the canonical architecture of children's literature” (169). Thus, it is instructive to consider the visions and values of the national, of the social, and of the literary-aesthetic, in the picture books chosen by the Children’s Book Council of Australia (CBCA) as the “best” of the early twenty-first century. These books not only constitute a kind of canon for contemporary Australian children’s literature, but may well come to define what contemporary Australian children’s literature means in the wider literary field. The Book of the Year: Picture Book awards given by the CBCA since 2001 demonstrate that it is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> the Booker Prize that, “The choices of winning books reflect not only on the books themselves, then, but also back on the Prize, affecting its reputation and creating journalistic capital which is vital for the Prize to achieve its prominence and impact. ” (81). Many of the twenty-first century CBCA award-winning picture books complicate traditional or comfortable understanding of Australianness, children’s literature, or “appropriate” modes of form and content, reminding us that “moments when texts resist or complicate recuperation into national discourses offer fruitful points for exploring the relationships between text and celebratory context” (Roberts 6). The CBCA has taken the opportunities offered by the liberation of the Picture Book category from an implied readership to challenge dominant constructions of children’s literature in Australia, and in so doing, are engaged in overt practices of canonicity with potentially long-lasting effects.

We show that a temporal electromagnetic field on cosmological scales generates an effective cosmological constant and that primordial electromagnetic quantum fluctuations produced during electroweak scale inflation coidd naturally explain, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the presence of this field, but also the measured value of the dark energy density. The theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests, and is free from classical or quantum instabilities. Thus, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the <b>true</b> nature <b>of</b> dark energy coidd be estabUshed without resorting to new physics, but also the value of the cosmological constant would find a natural explanation in the context of standard inflationary cosmology...|$|R
60|$|The {{compassion}} excited in all {{the witnesses}} was not without its danger to Tito; for conjecture is constantly guided by feeling, {{and more than one}} person suddenly conceived that this man might have been a scholar and have lost his faculties. On the other hand, they had not present to their minds the motives which could have led Tito to the denial of his benefactor, and having no ill-will towards him, it would have been difficult to them to believe that he had been uttering the basest of lies. And the originally common type of Baldassarre's person, coarsened by years of hardship, told as a confirmation of Tito's lie. If Baldassarre, to begin with, could have uttered precisely the words he had premeditated, there might have been something in the form of his accusation which would have given it the stamp <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>of</b> <b>true</b> experience but <b>of</b> mental refinement. But there had been no such testimony in his impulsive agitated words: and there seemed the very opposite testimony in the rugged face and the coarse hands that trembled beside it, standing out in strong contrast in the midst of that velvet-clad, fair-handed company.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{presence}} of a temporal electromagnetic field on cosmological scales generates an effective cosmological constant which can account for the accelerated expansion of the universe. Primordial electromagnetic quantum fluctuations produced during electroweak scale inflation could naturally explain the presence of this field and also the measured value of the dark energy density. The behavior of the electromagnetic field on cosmological scales is found to differ from the well studied short-distance behavior and, in fact, the presence of a non-vanishing cosmological constant could be signalling the breakdown of gauge invariance on cosmological scales. The theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests, and is free from classical or quantum instabilities. Thus we see that, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the <b>true</b> nature <b>of</b> dark energy can be established without resorting to new physics, but also the value of the cosmological constant finds a natural explanation in the context of standard inflationary cosmology. This mechanism could be discriminated from a true cosmological constant by upcoming observations of CMB anisotropies and large scale structure. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures.

2500|$|His {{character}} as a munificent patron of literature - {{which has made}} his name a household word - is gratefully acknowledged by the recipients of it and attested by the regrets of the men of letters of a later age, expressed by Martial and Juvenal. His patronage was exercised, not from vanity or a mere dilettante love of letters, but {{with a view to}} the higher interest of the state. He recognized in the genius of the poets of that time <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the <b>truest</b> ornament <b>of</b> the court, but the power of reconciling men's minds to the new order of things, and of investing the actual state of affairs with an ideal glory and majesty. The change in seriousness of purpose between the Eclogues and the Georgics of Virgil was in a great measure the result of the direction given by the statesman to the poet's genius. A similar change between the earlier odes of Horace, in which he declares his epicurean indifference to affairs of state, and the great national odes of the third book has been ascribed by some to the same guidance. [...] However, since the organization of the Odes is not entirely chronological, and their composition followed both books of Satires and the Epodes, this argument is plainly specious; but doubtless the milieu of Maecenas' circle influenced the writing of the Roman Odes (III.1-6) and others such as the ode to Pollio, Motum ex Metello (II.1).|$|R
40|$|Out of {{the four}} {{components}} of the electromagnetic field, Maxwell's theory only contains two physical degrees of freedom. However, in an expanding universe, consistently eliminating one of the "unphysical" states in the covariant (Gupta-Bleuler) formalism {{turns out to be}} difficult to realize. In this work we explore the possibility of quantization without subsidiary conditions. This implies that the theory would contain a third physical state. The presence of such a new (temporal) electromagnetic mode on cosmological scales is shown to generate an effective cosmological constant which can account for the accelerated expansion of the universe. This new polarization state is completely decoupled from charged matter, but can be excited gravitationally. In fact, primordial electromagnetic quantum fluctuations produced during electroweak scale inflation could naturally explain the presence of this mode and also the measured value of the cosmological constant. The theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests, it is free from classical or quantum instabilities and reduces to standard QED in the flat space-time limit. Thus we see that, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the <b>true</b> nature <b>of</b> dark energy can be established without resorting to new physics, but also the value of the cosmological constant finds a natural explanation in the context of standard inflationary cosmology. Possible signals, discriminating this model from LCDM, are also discussed. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures.

40|$|The entire aim of {{this work}} have been to {{initiate}} a new discursive space for feminist theory from an Islamic perspective. I looked at present feminist theoretical frameworks examining and questioning their underlying borrowed concepts and categories. This has often necessitated an inquiry into the very mode of thinking used for articulate feminist demands. Above all I hope to have demonstrated {{the need to do}} away with rigid and inflexible Cartesian dualism that perceives masculinity and femininity as two mutually exclusive and opposite categories. I argued the need to initiate a new scientific method of inquiry, a different mode of thinking, along Qur'anic epistemology, that allows for both, masculinity and femininity' to be seen as different but not antithetical. Indeed they do simultaneously co-exist in the same individual, albeit in different proportions. Such conceptualization of the genders and sexes is <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a <b>true</b> reflection <b>of</b> modem medical knowledge it has immense implication for social sciences. Such flexible categories are crucial for a new type of science, especially a new type of feminist theory, that is not anti-man, but pro-justice and equality, a unitary feminism (Hafner, 1994). A feminism that accept men and women as different but also very similar, a new theoretical framework that reflects better human realities i. e that differentiate between biological body and the socialized or social individual, thus allows male to express his feminine qualities and females to display masculine attributes without it causing major schism and thus conflict within the fundamental theory. In this work 1 explored one alternative mode of thinking the Islamic paradigm, and I hope more work will follow to further develop such an alternative...|$|R
60|$|The modern {{notion of}} impressing {{the public by}} a mere {{demonstration}} of unpopularity, by being thrown out of meetings or thrown into jail is largely a mistake. It rests on a fallacy touching the <b>true</b> popular value <b>of</b> martyrdom. People look at human history and see that it has often happened that persecutions have <b>not</b> <b>only</b> advertised but even advanced a persecuted creed, and given to its validity the public and dreadful witness of dying men. The paradox was pictorially expressed in Christian art, in which saints were shown brandishing as weapons the very tools that had slain them. And because his martyrdom is thus a power to the martyr, modern people think that any one who makes himself slightly uncomfortable in public will immediately be uproariously popular. This element of inadequate martyrdom is <b>not</b> <b>true</b> <b>only</b> <b>of</b> the Suffragettes; it is <b>true</b> <b>of</b> many movements I respect and some that I agree with. It was <b>true,</b> for instance, <b>of</b> the Passive Resisters, who had pieces of their furniture sold up. The assumption {{is that if you}} show your ordinary sincerity (or even your political ambition) by being a nuisance to yourself as well as to other people, you will have the strength of the great saints who passed through the fire. Any one who can be hustled in a hall for five minutes, or put in a cell for five days, has achieved what was meant by martyrdom, and has a halo in the Christian art of the future. Miss Pankhurst will be represented holding a policeman in each hand--the instruments of her martyrdom. The Passive Resister will be shown symbolically carrying the teapot that was torn from him by tyrannical auctioneers.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{consider}} quantum electromagnetic fields in an expanding universe. We start by reviewing the difficulties found {{when trying to}} impose the Lorenz condition in a time dependent geometry. Motivated by this fact, we explore the possibility of extending the electromagnetic theory by allowing the scalar state which is usually eliminated {{by means of the}} Lorenz condition to propagate, preserving {{at the same time the}} dynamics of ordinary transverse photons. We show that the new state cannot be generated by charged currents, but it breaks conformal invariance and can be excited gravitationally. In fact, primordial quantum fluctuations produced during inflation can give rise to super-Hubble temporal electromagnetic modes whose energy density behaves as a cosmological constant. The value of the effective cosmological constant is shown to agree with observations provided inflation took place at the electroweak scale. The theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests and is free from classical or quantum instabilities. Thus we see that, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the <b>true</b> nature <b>of</b> dark energy can be established without resorting to new physics, but also the value of the cosmological constant finds a natural explanation in the context of standard inflationary cosmology. On sub-Hubble scales, the new state generates an effective charge density which, due to the high electric conductivity of the cosmic plasma after inflation, gives rise to both vorticity and magnetic fields. Present upper limits on vorticity coming from CMB anisotropies are translated into lower limits on the present value of cosmic magnetic fields. We find that magnetic fields B(lambda) > 1 (- 12) G can be typically generated with coherence lengths ranging from sub-galactic scales up to the present Hubble radius. Those fields could act as seeds for a galactic dynamo or even account for observations just by collapse and differential rotation of the protogalactic cloud...|$|R
