5|$|While {{he still}} felt a disdain for public life, Tchaikovsky now {{participated in it}} for two reasons—his {{increasing}} celebrity, and what he felt was his duty to promote Russian music. To this end, he helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev, <b>now</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive relations among {{various members of the}} staff. Tchaikovsky also served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–90 season. In this post, he invited a number of international celebrities to conduct, including Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák and Jules Massenet. Tchaikovsky promoted Russian music both in his own compositions and in his role as a guest conductor. In January 1887 he substituted at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow on short notice for the first three performances of his opera Cherevichki. Conducting was something the composer had wanted to master for at least a decade, as he saw that success outside Russia depended to some extent on conducting his own works. Within a year of the Cherevichki performances, Tchaikovsky was in considerable demand throughout Europe and Russia, which helped him overcome a life-long stage fright and boosted his self-assurance.|$|E

500|$|Hansell was {{promoted}} to first lieutenant on October 1, 1934 and entered the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field as {{a student in the}} comprehensive 845-hour, 36-week course, studying not only air tactics and airpower theory, which comprised {{more than half of the}} curriculum, but also tactics of other services, combined (joint) warfare, armament and gunnery, logistics, navigation and meteorology, staff duties, photography, combat orders, and antiaircraft defenses. [...] Among his instructors was Captain George, <b>now</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department of Air Tactics and Strategy. George's classes were half lecture, half free discussion and conceptualizing, with George or his assistant Capt. Odas Moon expounding theories and having the students critically examine them for flaws and alternative ideas, debates that continued beyond the classroom as well.|$|E

2500|$|McKenzie was {{recommended}} for the Fisk presidency {{by his friend}} and colleague Thomas Jesse Jones, <b>now</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Phelps-Stokes Fund and a Fisk trustee. McKenzie's background impressed the Fisk trustees and the General Education Board. He was the most prominent sociologist in the nation specializing in Native American affairs, {{a founder of the}} Society of American Indians, and had experience in community development and forging relationships with White constituencies to promote minority advancement. McKenzie's strong Christian character and commitment to student discipline fit nicely with Fisk's history and mission, as well as the strongly Christian orientation of Nashville and the South. In mid-February 1915, McKenzie and several Fisk trustees traveled to Tuskegee to visit with Booker T. Washington and obtain his approval for McKenzie's candidacy. After receiving Washington's blessing, McKenzie accepted the position the fourth President of Fisk University, and immediately began his work. [...] McKenzie knew that past Fisk Presidents were constantly [...] "in the line of fire" [...] and worked under a microscope in Nashville. Only two months prior, John Cutler Shedd withdrew his name from consideration for the Presidency after assessing the demands of the position. McKenzie also knew that would expose himself and his administration to severe criticism, especially from Blacks. Black Nashvillians demanded a Black President at Fisk, students chaffed with the strict code of conduct, and Fisk alumnus W.E.B. Du Bois was an outspoken critic of the administration. McKenzie was challenged [...] "to breast the criticism of the critical Negro, the critical Southern white, and the critical Northern white, looking to the day when the wisdom as well as success will justify this course." ...|$|E
