5|$|Dahl {{was told}} by radio {{executives}} that he'd <b>never</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> in radio because his voice was too high. At one point, Dahl was so discouraged that he quit {{for about six months}} and attempted to pursue a career as a recording engineer. However, this never amounted to anything more than making mix tapes of popular songs for play on airplanes. Throughout this time period, he was making efforts to reconcile with his ex-wife, who by then was dating the program director at the Los Angeles radio station where she worked. He later admitted to stalking her by sleeping in his Subaru outside her house.|$|E
5|$|After a {{continued}} lack of confirmation of a North American release, including it not being included in Nintendo's 2011 release schedule, a fan-based movement called Operation Rainfall started {{a campaign to}} raise awareness for The Last Story, Xenoblade Chronicles, and another Wii RPG titled Pandora's Tower. This campaign included letter writing to Nintendo and petitions for its overseas release. Despite acknowledging the effort, Nintendo stated {{that there were no}} plans for a North American release. Matsumoto was severely disappointed by this decision and thought The Last Story would <b>never</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to North America. At this point, Xseed Games, who had developed a reputation for publishing niche Japanese games, took an interest in publishing the title. Initially approaching Nintendo in 2011, Nintendo confirmed that they had no plans to publish the title themselves. After playing through a Japanese copy of the game, and the staff were favorably impressed and decided to pitch to Nintendo for the game's North American publishing rights. They were helped by the connections between parent company AQ Interactive and Mistwalker. Xseed Games were the first publisher to ask Nintendo about The Last Story, and after being favorably impressed by their proposal, Nintendo granted Xseed Games publishing rights. While a new localization for North America was considered, it was decided to use Nintendo of Europe's localization as it better fitted the game's atmosphere and aesthetic. It officially released in North America on August 14, but problems with stock caused Amazon and GameStop to put orders on hold and push their release dates forward.|$|E

25|$|The {{eggs are}} round and white, and about 45mm in diameter. The {{hatchlings}} remain buried for days until they all emerge together at night. At around 50 to 70 days, the eggs hatch during the night, and the hatchlings instinctively head {{directly into the}} water. This {{is the most dangerous}} time in a turtle's life. As they walk, predators, such as gulls and crabs, feed on them. A significant percentage <b>never</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to the ocean. Little is known of the initial life history of newly hatched sea turtles. Juveniles spend three to five years in the open ocean before they settle as still-immature juveniles into their permanent shallow-water lifestyle. It is speculated that they take twenty to fifty years to reach sexual maturity. Individuals live up to eighty years in the wild. It is estimated that only 1% of hatchlings reach sexual maturity.|$|E
500|$|Welles {{continued}} {{to adjust the}} play throughout its short production, {{and at one point}} moved Mistress Quickly's speech about Falstaff's death to {{the very beginning of the}} play. Welles finally abandoned the entire project in late March 1960, when his friend Laurence Olivier offered him the chance to direct him in Eugène Ionesco's play Rhinoceros on London's West End. According to Keith Baxter, Welles ended the play's run because he was bored with it, and at one point told Baxter [...] "This is only a rehearsal for the movie, Keith, and I'll <b>never</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> unless you play Hal in that too." [...] Five years later, Baxter and Welles's youngest daughter, Beatrice Welles, who played Falstaff's page, were the only cast members from the play to appear in the film. [...] Chimes at Midnight was Welles's final performance in a theatrical play.|$|E

He dove straight toward the APC that was his target. He fired his six rockets in salvo, but instead of pulling up to the regular , he deliberately continued to dive his airplane and the remaining bomb straight into the target, firing his six machine guns. His plane sustained even heavier damage, and he crashed into the North Korean convoy destroying a large contingent of North Korean ground troops and vehicles though being killed instantly himself.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of [...] "Pee-wee Herman" [...] originated during a 1978 improvisation exercise with The Groundlings, where Reubens {{came up with}} the idea of a man who wanted to be a comic but was so inept at telling jokes that it was obvious to the audience that he would <b>never</b> <b>make</b> <b>it.</b> Fellow Groundling Phil Hartman would afterwards help Reubens develop the character while another Groundling, John Paragon, would help write the show. Despite having been compared to other famous characters, such as Hergé's Tintin and Collodi's Pinocchio, Reubens says that there is no specific source for [...] "Pee-wee" [...] but rather a collection of ideas. Pee-wee's voice originated in 1970 when Reubens appeared in a production of Life with Father, where he was cast as one of the most obnoxious characters in the play, for which Reubens adopted a cartoon-like way of speaking that would become Pee-wee's. Pee-wee's name resulted from a one-inch Pee Wee brand harmonica Reubens had as a child, and Herman was the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. The first small gray suit Pee-wee ever wore had been handmade for director and founder of the Groundlings Gary Austin, who passed it on to Reubens, while [...] "someone" [...] handed him the [...] "little kid bow tie" [...] before a show.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought that [...] "the out-takes [...] up to standard" [...] {{and said that the}} episode {{contains}} [...] "a number of great self-referential moments". Simone Knox praised its visual style in her article Reading the Ungraspable Double-Codedness of [...] "The Simpsons". The episode itself has been described by some critics as a kind of self-imposed benchmark of the show itself, with writer Bill Keveney commenting, [...] "the show picks its own benchmarks, as it did in 1995". Knox referred to it as not simply a clip show, but a clip show [...] "that looks at the series with a sense of hyper-self-consciousness about its own textuality". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said even though the episode is a clip show, it [...] "gussies up the concept with some interesting elements, and keeps repetitive material to a minimum. Instead, it offers lots of then-unseen footage as well as old snippets from The Tracey Ullman Show. It still feels like a cheap way to crank out a new episode, but it’s one of the better clip shows you’ll see." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B+ grade and commented, [...] "apart from the creative material, what really makes this [...] shine is the hilarious hosting by Troy McClure." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times criticized the episode: [...] "Despite some interesting concepts such as a bored Troy McClure presenting to much amusement and the presence of deleted scenes and Tracey Ullman shorts amongst the clips, this is an episode that tries hard to find a hook but never quite manages, assuring it'll <b>never</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into regular rotation on this viewer's watch." ...|$|E
500|$|The College Dropout was {{eventually}} issued by Roc-A-Fella in February 2004, shooting to number {{two on the}} Billboard 200 as his debut single, [...] "Through the Wire" [...] peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks. [...] "Slow Jamz", his second single featuring Twista and Jamie Foxx, became an even bigger success: it became the three musicians' first number one hit. The College Dropout received near-universal critical acclaim from contemporary music critics, was voted the top {{album of the year}} by two major music publications, and has consistently been ranked among the great hip-hop works and debut albums by artists. [...] "Jesus Walks", the album's fourth single, perhaps exposed West to a wider audience; the song's subject matter concerns faith and Christianity. The song nevertheless reached the top 20 of the Billboard pop charts, despite industry executives' predictions that a song containing such blatant declarations of faith would <b>never</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to radio. The College Dropout would eventually be certified triple platinum in the US, and garnered West 10 Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, and Best Rap Album (which it received). During this period, West also founded GOOD Music, a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers, such as No I.D. and John Legend. At the time, the focal point of West's production style was the use of sped-up vocal samples from soul records. However, partly because of the acclaim of The College Dropout, such sampling had been much copied by others; with that overuse, and also because West felt he had become too dependent on the technique, he decided to find a new sound. During this time, he also produced singles for Brandy, Common, John Legend, and Slum Village.|$|E
