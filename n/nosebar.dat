2500|$|Plywood {{production}} {{requires a}} good log, called a peeler, {{which is generally}} straighter and larger in diameter than one required for processing into dimensioned lumber by a sawmill. The log is laid horizontally and rotated about its long axis while a long blade is pressed into it, causing {{a thin layer of}} wood to peel off (much as a continuous sheet of paper from a roll). An adjustable <b>nosebar,</b> which may be solid or a roller, is pressed against the log during rotation, to create a [...] "gap" [...] for veneer to pass through between the knife and the <b>nosebar.</b> [...] The <b>nosebar</b> partly compresses the wood as it is peeled; it controls vibration of the peeling knife; and assists in keeping the veneer being peeled to an accurate thickness. [...] In this way the log is peeled into sheets of veneer, which are then cut to the desired oversize dimensions, to allow it to shrink (depending on wood species) when dried. [...] The sheets are then patched, graded, glued together and then baked in a press at a temperature of at least , and at a pressure of up to [...] (but more commonly 200 psi) to form the plywood panel. The panel can then be patched, have minor surface defects such as splits or small knot holes filled, re-sized, sanded or otherwise refinished, depending on the market for which it is intended.|$|E
40|$|In {{the wood}} thick-slicing process, the {{compressive}} force {{acting on the}} pressure bar face and the compressive deflections caused in wood play important roles, but few studies {{have dealt with the}} exact measurements of the deflections, and so, the main objective {{of this paper is to}} obtain several basic information on them. The clear specimens the end grain surface to which were applied thin sensitive films printed grid patterns, were prepared. After being soused in water up to saturated condition, they were set on the experimental apparatus equipped with two 2 -axis dynamometers (Fig. 1). Then, these test specimens were compressed or rolled out by two types of pressure bars in both stationary and feeding state of the feeding carriage. The distributions of the deflections in the specimens were determined from the moiré fringe pattern or the distortion pattern of grid line. Furthermore, in order to determine the effects of pressure bar compression and restraint in the thick-slicing process, cutting tests were carried out on the experimental apparatus, using a roller bar and a single faced <b>nosebar</b> (sharp bar), and the cutting force components acting on the tool face and the compressive force components acting on the pressure bar face were measured with the two 2 -axis dynanometers. The main results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) The vertical component of the compressive force acting on the bar face (Pv) varies largely with the combinations of horizontal distance (h) and vertical distance (v), whereas the horizontal component of the bar force (PH) varies slightly with h and v (Figs. 11 and 12). (2) In slicing with a roller bar, Pv increases largely with decrease in h. Therefore, the tool edge deflection due to overcompression of bar occurs in the smaller range of h (Fig. 10). (3) The distribution pattern of the deflection in the workpiece varies with the types of pressure bars applied, that is, in the case of sharp bar, the high strain concentrates at the loaded point and the distribution of the deflection is limited to a narrower area, but in the case of roller bar, the strain concentration diminishes and the distribution of the deflection spreads in a large area (Photos. 1 ～ 4). (4) Surfaces of the sliced veneer produced with a roller bar are well smoother than those with a sharp bar (Photos. 5 and 6). (5) From these results, it may be concluded that the major factors affecting the quality of the thick-sliced veneer are not only the bar restraint which is determined by the combinations of such factors as h, v, depth of cut (t), cutting angle (θ) and roller diameter of roller bar (D) but also the contact area between the bar face and the workpiece surface...|$|E
