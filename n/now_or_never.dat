25|$|In 2002, {{the group}} {{expressed}} {{a strong desire}} to leave their management company, The Firm. However, Carter chose to remain with The Firm to manage his solo career. Shortly afterwards, {{the rest of the group}} began recording their next album without him. The relationship with JIVE Records worsened when the Backstreet Boys filed a $75–100 million lawsuit against Zomba Music Group (JIVE's parent company), claiming breach of contract. They claimed that the label promoted Carter's solo album <b>Now</b> <b>or</b> <b>Never</b> at the expense of the group.|$|E
25|$|The single fact of John Paul II's {{election}} in 1978 changed everything. In Poland, everything began. Not in East Germany or Czechoslovakia. Then {{the whole thing}} spread. Why in 1980 did they lead the way in Gdansk? Why did they decide, <b>now</b> <b>or</b> <b>never?</b> Only {{because there was a}} Polish pope. He was in Chile and Pinochet was out. He was in Haiti and Duvalier was out. He was in the Philippines and Marcos was out. On many of those occasions, people would come here to the Vatican thanking the Holy Father for changing things.|$|E

25|$|The Dillinger Escape Plan {{evolved from}} the {{hardcore}} punk band Arcane around 1996. The original lineup included vocalist Dimitri Minakakis, guitarists Ben Weinman, and Derrick Brantley, bassist Adam Doll and drummer Chris Pennie. The band was nameless for many months until long time friend of the band Matt Backerman decided to form <b>Now</b> <b>Or</b> <b>Never</b> records and asked the band to both perform {{on one of his}} underground basement shows and record what would be his and the bands self titled six-track EP. They quickly, without much thought, chose the name “The Dillinger Escape Plan” while watching a documentary on the John Dillinger, a early 1930s bank robber, famous for his multiple escapes from jail. Brantley didn't show up when the band was recording the 6 song self titled effort with Producer Steve Evetts causing the band to record as a quartet.|$|E
25|$|The {{team had}} been known informally as the Blue Bulls since the 1940s and from 8 June 1963 in a {{newspaper}} cartoon by Victor Ivanoff had been portrayed as such. Their name officially changed to the Blue Bulls {{at the end of}} 1997 season and in 1998 after 6 years of not reaching the final and some very heavy defeats at Currie Cup level, the Bulls, captained by another legend, Joost van der Westhuizen, managed to reach the final for a record 24th time after the come-back of the century in the semi-final against a star-studded Sharks outfit. The Bulls' triumph was nothing short of remarkable. After André Joubert's second try early in the second half, which stretched the Sharks' lead from 10-3 to 17-3, even their coach, Eugene van Wyk, believed that they had no chance. But whatever Bulls captain Van der Westhuizen told his team while Gavin Lawless was setting up for the conversion of Joubert's second try, it made them realise that it was <b>now</b> <b>or</b> <b>never.</b> Suddenly, they started playing with new life and new direction. Franco Smith scored a couple of penalties and then prop Piet Boer dived over for a try. The last 12 minutes with the score on 17-all, were dramatic. First, flanker Nicky van der Walt put the Bulls ahead with a magnificent try following Van der Westhuizen's brilliant opportunistic play and great ball skills. And the last nail went into the Sharks coffin when the Bulls were awarded a penalty try for an early tackle by André Joubert on Grant Esterhuizen in the in-goal area. The following Saturday they defeated Western Province 24-20 at Loftus. With only a few minutes left on the clock, Province must have thought they won it when their Springbok-winger Chester Williams went over in the corner, but referee André Watson ruled the pass from Robbie Fleck forward.|$|E
500|$|William Petit {{had been}} able to free himself, escape his confines, and call to a {{neighbor}} for help. The neighbor indicated that he did not recognize him due to the severity of Petit's injuries. In court testimony, William Petit stated that he felt a [...] "jolt of adrenaline" [...] coupled with a need to escape upon hearing one of the perpetrators state: [...] "Don't worry, it's going to be all over in a couple of minutes." [...] Petit then told the jury, [...] "I thought, it's <b>now</b> <b>or</b> <b>never</b> because in my mind at that moment, I {{thought they were going to}} shoot all of us." ...|$|E

5000|$|Aehrenthal wanted {{full control}} of Bosnia-Herzogovina through {{annexation}} even though Austria-Hungary had administered the provinces since 1878. His reasons for this lay in the possible recovery of the [...] "sick man of Europe", Turkey. The [...] "Young Turk" [...] revolution of 1908, led in part by Enver Pasha, convinced some that the Ottoman Empire {{might be on the}} rise again. Thus, Aehrenthal reasoned, it was <b>now</b> <b>or</b> maybe <b>never.</b> He would discuss this matter with Izvolsky to ensure the Russians would not interfere with the annexation plans.|$|R

He has also been critical of Alberto Contador, the UCI, and its former president, Pat McQuaid. In December 2012, LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made {{at the head of}} leadership for the UCI, and stated if called upon {{he would be willing to}} take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping. Said LeMond: [...] "It is <b>now</b> <b>or</b> <b>never</b> to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case another chance will not arise.

500|$|Breeds {{acknowledged}} {{that from a}} musical stand point someone who inspires you creatively and acts as your muse, is a special bond. She attributed it to Liam's feelings for Ruby. Ruby and Liam continue to act a support unit for one another. As the scholarship develops they {{talk to each other}} about [...] "mature things that surpass a student-teacher relationship." [...] Liam later develops feelings for Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) and Ruby is seeing Liam slip from her grasp. Breeds said [...] "She sees them flirting and she has a moment where she realises that she's so in love with this guy and it's kind of <b>now</b> <b>or</b> <b>never.</b> She needs to take action."

5|$|Regional airports, such as Edinburgh Airport, have {{experienced}} strong growth in CAT operations in recent years. These operations are commercially and operationally incompatible with GA, {{and although there}} is no evidence of deliberate discrimination, the effect has been to discourage or exclude it. GA aircraft are being subject to significant increases in charges, including the imposition of handling fees in some cases. Some airports restrict or deny GA parking, and others limit or refuse certain GA activity. As a result, light GA aircraft are <b>now</b> rarely <b>or</b> <b>never</b> seen at large, busy international airports such as Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester.|$|R

A little later, a Muslim delegation to the Parliamentary Committee on Indian Constitutional Reforms gave short shrift to the Pakistan idea, calling it [...] "chimerical and impracticable".|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] {{literally}} means [...] "Land of the Pure" [...] in Urdu and Persian.

2500|$|God Bless The Go-Go's {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Peter Fawthrop of AllMusic wrote [...] "Every bit as Go-Go's, that is, as their non-hits and less remarkable material. While The Go-Go's sound is intact, {{there is not}} a [...] "We Got the Beat" [...] or a [...] "Head Over Heels" [...] to be found. It is feasible that in this age of pop rebirth, The Go-Go's decided it was <b>now</b> <b>or</b> <b>never</b> ... The album doesn't attempt to update the band's sound with hip-hop moves or electronic frippery, for which God should bless 'em, indeed. The girls' hold on the current pop world remains so strong that Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong co-writes a song ("Unforgiven") in impeccable Go-Go's drag".|$|E

25|$|In a {{surprise}} move, the lame duck zoning commission reversed course in late November 1974 and approved the proposed revised zoning {{rules for the}} Georgetown waterfront. The Washington Post reported that the rezoning process would have to begin again under the home-rule zoning commission, and there was little chance that the new commission {{would be able to}} approve anything like the proposed regulations. The existing zoning commission acted, the newspaper suggested, because it would suffer no political retaliation (having gone out of business), its actions could give the home-rule zoning commission political cover to retain the rules, and because its members believed there had been enough delay and consideration of the rules. Development, the old commission felt, had to proceed <b>now</b> <b>or</b> it <b>never</b> would. The GCA immediately sued to have the new zoning regulations overturned, and the D.C.
