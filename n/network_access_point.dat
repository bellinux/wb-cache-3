500|$|Manchester <b>Network</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Point</b> is {{the only}} {{internet}} exchange point in the UK outside London, and forms the main hub for the region. Household internet access in Northern England is {{at or above the}} UK average, but speeds and broadband penetration vary greatly. In 2013 the average speed in central Manchester was 60Mbit/s, while in nearby Warrington the average speed was only 6.2Mbit/s. Hull, which is unique in the UK in that its telephone network was never nationalised, has simultaneously some of the fastest and slowest internet speeds in the country: many households have [...] "ultrafast" [...] fibre optic broadband as standard, but {{it is also one of}} only two places in the UK where over 30% of businesses receive less than 10 Mbit/s. Speeds are especially poor in the rural parts of the North, with many small towns and villages completely without high speed access. Some areas have therefore formed their own community enterprises, such as Broadband 4 Rural North in Lancashire and Cybermoor in Cumbria, to install high-speed internet connections. Mobile broadband coverage is similarly patchy, with 3G and 4G almost universal in cities but unavailable in large parts of Yorkshire, the North East and Cumbria.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the Peer Database Management System (PDBMS). This system runs {{on top of}} the {{standard}} database management system, and it allows it to connect its database with other (peer) databases on the network.

We think of database mobility as a database network, where databases appear and disappear spontaneously and their <b>network</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> may change, and are not known a priori. There is a further request (and proposed PDBMS satisfies it) that databases must know, independently of their <b>network</b> <b>access</b> <b>points,</b> how to locate other databases, and how to interoperate with them on servicing user requests (i. e., queries and updates) ...|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{local area}} {{networks}} (WLAN) are rapidly becoming a core part of <b>network</b> <b>access.</b> Supporting user mobility, more specifically session continuation in changing <b>network</b> <b>access</b> <b>points,</b> {{is becoming an}} integral part of wireless network services. This is because of the popularity of emerging real-time streaming applications that can be commonly used when the user is mobile, such as voice-over-IP and Internet radio. However, mobility introduces a new set of problems in wireless environments because of handoffs between <b>network</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> (APs). The IEEE 802. 11 i security standard imposes an authentication delay long enough to hamper real-time applications. This chapter will provide a comprehensive study on fast authentication solutions found in the literature as well as the industry that address this problem. These proposals focus on solving the mentioned problem for intradomain handoff scenarios where the <b>access</b> <b>points</b> belong to the same administrative domain or provider. Interdomain roaming is also becoming common-place for wireless access. We need fast authentication solutions for these environments that are managed by independent administrative authorities. We detail such a solution that explores the use of local trust relationships to foster fast authentication...|$|R

40|$|The {{delivery}} of data in pervasive systems {{has to deal}} with end host mobility. One problem is how to create appropriate, applicationlevel data provisioning topologies, termed data brokers, to best match underlying network connectivity, end user locations, and the locales of their <b>network</b> <b>access.</b> Another problem is how to balance workloads in such overlay networks, in response to mobility and to changes in available processing and communication resources. This paper improves the performance of data provisioning by dynamically changing broker topologies and end users' assignments to brokers. Specifically, using publish /subscribe as a communication paradigm, a new abstraction, termed an opportunistic event channel, enables dynamic broker creation, deletion, and movement. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the ability of opportunistic channels to optimize event delivery and processing when end users move across di#erent <b>network</b> <b>access</b> <b>points.</b> The technique is to `opportunistically' follow network-level hando#s across <b>network</b> <b>access</b> <b>points</b> with application-level hando#s of a user's broker functionality to a new, `closer' broker. The potential load imbalances across brokers caused by such hando#s are also addressed...|$|R
