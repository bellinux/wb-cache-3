Modernism was also responsible for the liberation {{of the complexity of}} the Portuguese view of themselves (at least in regard to poetry), mainly thanks to Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935), the second great Portuguese poet. He had a unique and complex personality, and he wrote under many names, not pseudonyms, but what he named as heteronyms: each heteronym had its own personality, way of writing and biography. The most renowned are: Alberto Caeiro, considered the master of them all, positivist and bucolic, Ricardo Reis, pagan and epicurist (but with stoical influence), Fernando Pessoa's autonym, trapped in his interior labyrinth and tedium, Álvaro de Campos, futurist, and Bernardo Soares, who wrote Livro do Desassosego (Book of Disquiet). Fernando Pessoa Mensagem (Message) is a sebastianist poem formed of a series of smaller ones.

40|$|Social {{functioning}} deficits {{have long}} been implicated in explanations for sexual abuse. Historically, this understanding has been rooted in research findings, which differentiate child molesters from nonsexual offenders on constructs such as social skills, empathy, and cognitive distortions. The goal {{of the current study}} was to examine how these various indicators of social functioning are combined to explain sexual aggression in child molesters. To this end, a model of general aggression in <b>non</b> offenders was <b>adapted</b> and tested to explain sexual and general aggression child molesters. Specifically, it was proposed that poor social intelligence contributes to negative attitudes and beliefs about sexual contact with children (i. e. cognitive distortions), which inhibits capacity for victim specific empathy responses, which in turn leads to sexually aggressive behaviour. Participants were incarcerated men who had been convicted of a sexual offence against a child (N = 122) and men {{who may or may not}} be incarcerated, but have never admitted to, been charged with, or convicted of a sexual offence (N = 61). As predicted, child molesters (relative to non child molesters) reported poorer social intelligence, victim specific and general empathy deficits, and greater cognitive distortions about sexual contact with children. Although these factors were not predictive of sexual aggression, general empathy accounted for significant variance in the prediction of general aggression in child molesters. Interestingly, cognitive distortions made virtually no direct contribution to aggression. However, support was found for a negative influence of cognitive distortions on general empathy, which was then negatively related to general aggression. The results of this study were found after controlling for a number of confounding variables, which suggests that social competency factors are relevant over and above demographic and criminal history factors in understanding aggression in child molesters. This study demonstrates the importance of integrating independent factors into a testable model, has implications for etiological theories, and contributes to understanding the complex role of social functioning factors in aggression...|$|R
40|$|Bioethanol and biogas are two {{possible}} alternatives to fossil fuel resources. The second generation fermentations involving lignocellulosic material {{is one of}} the latest fields for bioethanol science. In the current work two fermentation yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae J 672 and the alternative fermentation yeast Dekkera bruxellensis CBS 11269, were compared in an experimental design for their ability to ferment spruce lignocelluloses. The goal was to find differences between the growth and ethanol yield of the two species. The investigation was done with a multivariate data analysis tool to examine yeast growth and ethanol yield. Four quantitative factors, pH, temperature, concentration of hydrolysate, and initial cell density were used. The analysis also included one qualitative factor with two settings, aerobic and oxygen limited. The five factors were tested in a fractional factorial design created with MODDE software. The results for the experimental design with S. cerevisiae showed that the main significant factor for ethanol yield was oxygen. Oxygen was the most important factor for S. cerevisiae ethanol yield response, oxygen limitation had positive contribution and aerobic environment had negative contribution. The oxygen factor however was not important for growth. pH was a significant factor and high pH was shown to give better response, for both yeast growth and ethanol yield. Oxygen and temperature had negative contribution while the two factors initial cell concentration and concentration of hydrolysate did not show any significant contribution to the model for S. cerevisiae ethanol yield. D. bruxellensis was adapted to spruce hydrolysate before the final experiment. This was because the <b>non</b> <b>adapted</b> D. bruxellensis CBS 11269 did not grow well, in the first experiment, and did not build a model. The two models with S. cerevisiae J 672 and spruce adapted D. bruxellensis CBS 11269 are therefore not directly comparable. The adapted D. bruxellensis model for ethanol yield was not complete. Analysis of the data showed a strong curvature within the model and further analysis is needed to complete the model. However the experiment resulted in a very good model for yeast growth. It showed that pH and initial cell concentration was positive for growth and that hydrolysate concentration had a strong negative contribution to growth. The temperature had a negative contribution and the oxygen factor was not significant for D. bruxellensis growth. When comparing the ethanol yields between both adapted and <b>non</b> <b>adapted</b> D. bruxellensis with S. cerevisiae, both D. bruxellensis yeasts shows a higher or equal total yield.

Additionally, the influence of physical state (powder and ready to use formulae), the type of container used and the impact of industrial process from different manufacturers on lead levels were evaluated.

40|$|Abstract The {{enormous}} {{growth of}} network traffic, {{in conjunction with}} the need to monitor even larger and more capillary network deployments, poses a significant scalability challenge to the network monitoring process. We believe that a promising way to address this challenge consists in rethinking monitoring tasks as partially performed inside the network itself. Indeed, in-network monitoring devices, such as traffic capturing probes, may be instructed to perform intelligent processing and filtering mechanisms, so that the amount of data ultimately delivered to central monitoring entities can be significantly reduced to that strictly necessary for a more careful and fine-grained data inspection. In such a direction, this chapter focuses on the design and implementation of an hardware-based frontend pre-filter for the topmost known Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Motivated by the practical impossibility to pack a large amount of legacy Snort rules over a resource-constrained hardware device, we specifically address the question on how Snort rules should be adapted and simplified {{so that they can be}} supported over a commercial, low-end, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board, meanwhile providing good filtering performance. Focusing on about one thousand Snort rules randomly drawn from the complete rule set, we experimentally determine how these rules can be simplified meanwhile retaining a comparable detection performance with respect to the original, <b>non</b> <b>adapted,</b> rules...|$|E

The efficiency of the extrusion system is keeping a low intracellular level of the toxic compound will depend on its uptake rate. Measurements of the initial uptake rate of benzoic acid and glycerol led to linear kinetics, indicative of simple diffusion. The presence of benzoic acid in the growth medium decreased diffusion coefficients. These results suggest that weak acid tolerance is determined by the lipidic composition of the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis plasma membranes were purified from S. cerevisiae and Z. bailii cells. Total lipids were extracted and different lipid classes were analysed.

A radical shift from uncontrolled flooding irrigation as currently practiced by farmers in Mugerero paddy farming zone towards efficient allocation and use of water resources is important to save water that could be allocated to other water users. This paper surveys current and past views on the way irrigation water is allocated in the irrigation scheme of Mugerero and how farmers are using water for paddy production purpose.

In the present study, four pathogenic E. coli strains (STEC O 157 :H 7, STEC O 26 :H 11, STEC O 159 :H-, EPEC O 157 :H 45) and a control strain (E. coli K 12) were examined for growth and persistence under hydrochloric, acetic and lactic acid stress. In the growth experiments, the O 157 :H 45 strain (hydrochloric and acetic acid) and the O 157 :H 7 strain (acetic acid) showed improved acid resistance, whereas no differences were evident for the other strains.

40|$|Abstract Background Oxidative {{stress can}} {{severely}} compromise viability of bifidobacteria. Exposure of Bifidobacterium cells to oxygen causes accumulation of reactive oxygen species, mainly hydrogen peroxide, leading to cell death. In this study, {{we tested the}} suitability of continuous culture under increasing selective pressure combined with immobilized cell technology for the selection of hydrogen peroxide adapted Bifidobacterium cells. Cells of B. longum NCC 2705 were immobilized in gellan-xanthan gum gel beads and used to continuously ferment MRS medium containing increasing concentration of H 2 O 2 from 0 to 130 ppm. Results At {{the beginning of the}} culture, high cell density of 10 13 CFU per litre of reactor was tested. The continuous culture gradually adapted to increasing H 2 O 2 concentrations. However, after increasing the H 2 O 2 concentration to 130 ppm the OD of the culture decreased to 0. Full wash out was prevented by the immobilization of the cells in gel matrix. Hence after stopping the stress, it was possible to re-grow the cells that survived the highest lethal dose of H 2 O 2 and to select two adapted colonies (HPR 1 and HPR 2) after plating of the culture effluent. In contrast to HPR 1, HPR 2 showed stable characteristics over at least 70 generations and exhibited also higher tolerance to O 2 than <b>non</b> <b>adapted</b> wild type cells. Preliminary characterization of HPR 2 was carried out by global genome expression profile analysis. Two genes coding for a protein with unknown function and possessing trans-membrane domains and an ABC-type transporter protein were overexpressed in HPR 2 cells compared to wild type cells. Conclusions Our study showed that continuous culture with cell immobilization is a valid approach for selecting cells adapted to hydrogen peroxide.

40|$|Crossmodal stimuli can be {{perceived}} as being simultaneous {{even if they are}} not physically synchronous. This phenomenon has been attributed to different conduction delays. In this work we tested whether time in different modalities is processed independently or if crossmodal interaction influence the perception of synchrony. (1) If unimodal timing is processed independently, perceived simultaneity across modality pairs should be Transitive. For example, if modality A has to be presented 20 ms before modality B to appear simultaneous and modality B 10 ms before modality C, then A should be presented 30 ms before C to appear simultaneous. Subjects made Temporal Order Judgments (TOJ) of asynchronous signals in three modality pairs (audio-visual, audio-tactile, visual-tactile). The Point of Subjective Simultaneity (PSS) calculated for each modality pair are not transitive, indicating that perceived time is not processed independently in each modality. (2) It has been shown that PSS of audio-visual signals can be recalibrated by the repeated presentation of asynchronous stimuli. It is not clear whether this effect is the result of an adaptation mechanism specific to the audio-visual modality pair or whether it is due to a common crossmodal mechanism. Using the same type of measurements, we show that PSS following presentation of an asynchronous audio-visual stimulus is not constant in the audio-tactile modality pair. Hence, crossmodal timing is also affected by a common adaptation mechanism. Since PSS for visual-tactile stimuli was not affected, audio-visual adaptation effects are likely the result of a phenomenal shift of the auditory events in time. Our results indicate that perceived timing in one modality depends on which other modality this is paired with and that perceived simultaneity changes also for <b>non</b> <b>adapted</b> modality pairs. These results are not consistent with independent-channels models of crossmodal timing, but they rather indicate that time perception is affected by crossmodal interactions...|$|E
40|$|Continuous fibre {{reinforced}} thermoplastics are a high competitive material {{class for}} diversified applications {{because of their}} inherent properties like light-weight construction potential, integral design, corrosion resistance and high energy absorption level. Using these materials, one approach towards a large volume scaled part production rate is covered by an automated process line, consisting of a pressing process for semi-finished sheet material production, a thermoforming step and some additional joining technologies. To allow short cycle times in the thermoforming step, the utilised semi-finished sheet materials, which are {{often referred to as}} 'oganic sheets', have to be fully impregnated and consolidated. Nowadays even this combination of outstanding physical and chemical material properties combined with the economic processing technology are no guarantee for the break-through of continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastics, mainly because of the high material costs for the semi-finished sheet materials. These costs can be attributed to a <b>non</b> <b>adapted</b> material selection or choice of process parameters, as well as by unfavourable pressing process type itself. Therefore the aim of the present investigations was to generate some alternatives regarding the choice of raw materials, the set-up or the selection of the pressing process line and to provide some theoretical tools for the determination of process parameters and dimensions. Concerning raw material aspects, the use of the blending technology is one promising approach towards cost reduction for the matrix component. Novel characteristics related to the fibre structure are CF-yarns with high filament numbers (e. g. 6 K or 12 K instead of 3 K) or multiaxial fibre orientations. These two approaches were both conducted for sheet materials with carbon fibre reinforcement and high temperature thermoplastics. Two new developed ternary blend matrices consisting of PEEK and PEI as the main ingredients were tested in comparison with neat PEEK. PES and PSU were used as the third blend component, which provides a cost reduction potential approximately 30 % compared to the basis PEEK polymer. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract Background Nonhost {{resistance}} (NHR) provides {{immunity to}} {{all members of}} a plant species against all isolates of a microorganism that is pathogenic to other plant species. Three Arabidopsis thaliana PEN (penetration deficient) genes, PEN 1, 2 and 3 {{have been shown to}} provide NHR against the barley pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei at the prehaustorial level. Arabidopsis pen 1 - 1 mutant lacking the PEN 1 gene is penetrated by the hemibiotrophic oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae, the causal organism of the root and stem rot disease in soybean. We investigated if there is any novel nonhost resistance mechanism in Arabidopsis against the soybean pathogen, P. sojae. Results The P. s ojae susceptible (pss) 1 mutant was identified by screening a mutant population created in the Arabidopsis pen 1 - 1 mutant that lacks penetration resistance against the <b>non</b> <b>adapted</b> barley biotrophic fungal pathogen, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei. Segregation data suggested that PEN 1 is not epistatic to PSS 1. Responses of pss 1 and pen 1 - 1 to P. sojae invasion were distinct and suggest that PSS 1 may act at both pre- and post-haustorial levels, while PEN 1 acts at the pre-haustorial level against this soybean pathogen. Therefore, PSS 1 encodes a new form of nonhost resistance. The pss 1 mutant is also infected by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen, Fusarium virguliforme, which causes sudden death syndrome in soybean. Thus, a common NHR mechanism is operative in Arabidopsis against both hemibiotrophic oomycetes and necrotrophic fungal pathogens that are pathogenic to soybean. However, PSS 1 does not play any role in immunity against the bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea, that causes bacterial blight in soybean. We mapped PSS 1 to a region very close to the southern telomere of chromosome 3 that carries no known disease resistance genes. Conclusions The study revealed that Arabidopsis PSS 1 is a novel nonhost resistance gene that confers a new form of nonhost resistance against both a hemibiotrophic oomycete pathogen, P. sojae and a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, F. virguliforme that cause diseases in soybean. However, this gene does not play any role in the immunity of Arabidopsis to the bacterial pathogen, P. syringae pv. glycinea, which causes bacterial blight in soybean. Identification and further characterization of the PSS 1 gene would provide further insights into a new form of nonhost resistance in Arabidopsis, which could be utilized in improving resistance of soybean to two serious pathogens. </p...|$|E

40|$|Bacteria adhesion, and {{consequent}} biofilm formation, in vitro and in vivo, are phenomena that often occur naturally {{but are also}} bacteria´s strategies {{to protect themselves from}} stress factors, playing probably an important role in virulence. Furthermore, bacteria growing in biofilms are less susceptible to many antibacterial agents than their suspended counterparts. These factors emphasize the need of suitable and efficient surface disinfection procedures {{in order to reduce the}} overgrowth of resistant microorganisms in response to an ineffective course of antimicrobials. In this study, we examined the effect of adaptation of P. aeruginosa to a surfactant, benzalkonium chloride (BZK), on the adherence of bacterial cells to PET, conditioned and non-conditioned with BZK, and on their ability to resist to removal and BZK aggression. The assays were carried out in a PPFC. Bacterial adaptation was attained by exposing P. aeruginosa to gradual increasing concentrations of BZK, and selected in TSA supplemented with 4. 0 mM BZK. The results show that adapted P. aeruginosa adhered in a more extent than the non-adapted counterpart. For both strains, the pre-conditioning of the PET surfaces significantly favored bacterial adhesion. The higher adhesion was observed with the adapted bacteria onto the conditioned PET coupons. These results highlight that the extent of adhesion is greater the higher are the stress factors. The strength of adhesion is also higher in the case of adapted bacteria since detachment only occurs with P. aeruginosa non-adapted. BZK application did not cause significant removal except for P. aeruginosa non-adapted adhered to non-conditioned PET. Nevertheless, BZK attack causes loss of viability of the cells that remained adhered to the surfaces, this loss being more notorious in the case of <b>non</b> <b>adapted</b> cells adhered in the conditioned surfaces. Based on the results it can be said that the presence of BZK residues on the adhesion surfaces did not impair the bacterial adhesion capacity though affects the viability of the adhered cells. It can also be concluded that resistant bacteria that survived to a simple adaptation step to a common antimicrobial agent increased its adherence ability and insusceptibility to removal and antimicrobial treatment. In a disinfection point of view, these results can represent additional problems for the eradication of pathogenic bacteria with increased virulence from equipment and surfaces in the medical arenas...|$|E
