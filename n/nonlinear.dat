25|$|The {{original}} maximum-margin hyperplane algorithm {{proposed by}} Vapnik in 1963 constructed a linear classifier. However, in 1992, Bernhard E. Boser, Isabelle M. Guyon and Vladimir N. Vapnik suggested {{a way to}} create <b>nonlinear</b> classifiers by applying the kernel trick (originally proposed by Aizerman et al.) to maximum-margin hyperplanes. The resulting algorithm is formally similar, except that every dot product {{is replaced by a}} <b>nonlinear</b> kernel function. This allows the algorithm to fit the maximum-margin hyperplane in a transformed feature space. The transformation may be <b>nonlinear</b> and the transformed space high dimensional; although the classifier is a hyperplane in the transformed feature space, it may be <b>nonlinear</b> in the original input space.|$|E
25|$|They are {{characterized}} by a high peak intensity (or more correctly, irradiance) that usually leads to <b>nonlinear</b> interactions in various materials, including air. These processes are studied {{in the field of}} <b>nonlinear</b> optics.|$|E
25|$|As with {{two-dimensional}} nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (2DNMR) spectroscopy, this technique spreads the spectrum in two dimensions and allows for the observation of cross peaks that contain information on the coupling between different modes. In contrast to 2DNMR, <b>nonlinear</b> two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy also involves the excitation to overtones. These excitations result in excited state absorption peaks located below the diagonal and cross peaks. In 2DNMR, two distinct techniques, COSY and NOESY, are frequently used. The cross peaks in the first {{are related to the}} scalar coupling, while in the latter they are related to the spin transfer between different nuclei. In <b>nonlinear</b> two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, analogs have been drawn to these 2DNMR techniques. <b>Nonlinear</b> two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy with zero waiting time corresponds to COSY, and <b>nonlinear</b> two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy with finite waiting time allowing vibrational population transfer corresponds to NOESY. The COSY variant of <b>nonlinear</b> two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy has been used for determination of the secondary structure content of proteins.|$|E
25|$|Linear {{differential}} equations frequently appear as approximations to <b>nonlinear</b> equations. These approximations are only valid under restricted conditions.

25|$|Multilayer kernel {{machines}} (MKM) {{are a way}} {{of learning}} highly <b>nonlinear</b> functions by iterative application of weakly <b>nonlinear</b> kernels.

25|$|Stokes' wave theory — a perturbation-series {{approach}} to the description of weakly <b>nonlinear</b> and dispersive waves, especially successful in deeper water for relative short wavelengths, {{as compared to the}} water depth. However, for long waves the Boussinesq approach—as also applied in the KdV equation—is often preferred. This is because in shallow water the Stokes' perturbation series needs many terms before convergence towards the solution, due to the peaked crests and long flat troughs of the <b>nonlinear</b> waves. While the KdV or Boussinesq models give good approximations for these long <b>nonlinear</b> waves.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even after}} the above deliberations, {{it is still not}} clear whether one is {{justified}} in using an inherently linear relation to simplify a <b>nonlinear</b> wave equation. Nevertheless, it is a very common practice in <b>nonlinear</b> acoustics as the textbooks on the subject show: e.g., Naugolnykh and Ostrovsky and Hamilton and Morfey.|$|E
25|$|Non-linear {{differential}} equations are {{formed by the}} products of the unknown function and its derivatives are allowed and its degree is > 1.There are very few methods of solving <b>nonlinear</b> {{differential equations}} exactly; those that are known typically depend on the equation having particular symmetries. <b>Nonlinear</b> differential equations can exhibit very complicated behavior over extended time intervals, characteristic of chaos. Even the fundamental questions of existence, uniqueness, and extendability of solutions for <b>nonlinear</b> differential equations, and well-posedness of initial and boundary value problems for <b>nonlinear</b> PDEs are hard problems and their resolution in special cases {{is considered to be a}} significant advance in the mathematical theory (cf.
