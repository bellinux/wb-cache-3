25|$|Over her career, {{she broke}} {{a number of}} French record ranging from the mile run to the 10,000 metres. Her first {{national}} record mark came in 1985, when she ran a time of 8:52.32 minutes for the 3000 metres. She improved this to 8:50.56 the following month and broke Patricia Deneuville's French mile record a month after that (registering a time of 4:39.35 mins). In July 1986 she lopped {{three and a half}} seconds off her 3000m mark, set a time of 5:39.00 mins for the 2000m, then bettered Joëlle de Brouwer's 5000 metres record by almost twenty seconds, setting a new standard of 15:32.92 mins. Two further improvements over 3000m and 5000m came in 1988, with runs of 8:44.19 and 15:18.24 mins respectively. She also beat Christine Loiseau's record over 10,000m that year. In 1990 she ran 15:16.44 mins for the 5000m, which was to be her last <b>national</b> <b>mark</b> over that distance. Her run of 31:51.68 minutes at that year's European Championships made her the first Frenchwoman to complete the event in under 32 minutes. Although her 2000m time is still the best set by a French athlete, all her records in other events were not long-standing: her 3000m was beaten by Marie-Pierre Duros after a year, her 10,000m mark was beaten by Rosario Murcia after two years, while her 5000m was broken after four years by Farida Fatès.|$|E
