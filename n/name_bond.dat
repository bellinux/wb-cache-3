5000|$|A {{native of}} Chicago, Bonds {{grew up in}} a home visited by many of the leading black intellectuals of the era; among houseguests were soprano Abbie Mitchell and composers Florence Price and Will Marion Cook. Bonds showed an early {{aptitude}} for composition, writing her first work, Marquette Street Blues, at the age of five. Her parents were Monroe Alpheus Majors and his first wife, Estelle C. Bond. Margaret took the last <b>name,</b> <b>Bond,</b> after her parents divorced in 1917. [...] Her first study in music came when she took piano lessons from her mother. While still in school, she studied composition with Price and with William Dawson.

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>name</b> <b>Bond</b> Hill remains {{something}} of a mystery. Newspaper articles documenting the founding and naming of the railroad suburb by the cooperative indicate that Bond Hill {{was the name of}} the area in the 1830s: [...] "This was the name of that particular locality forty years ago, and carries with it associations not easily forgotten by the oldest inhabitants," [...] (January 10, 1871, Cincinnati Daily Enquirer). An oral history transcribed in 1961 by George E. Patmor, one of the village's earliest residents, indicates that the name was first given by visitors to a sawmill operated by a man named Bond: [...] "In these days the people of St. Bernard and Cincinnati would use a footpath through the woods 'for a shortcut from St. Bernard to Bond’s sawmill to work or transact business.' It got to be a common saying that they were going up on Bond Hill, so this is how we got the name 'Bond Hill'." [...] Local historian, Aharon Varady, speculates that like other mills in upper Millcreek Township, Bond's Mill may have been a gathering site for gambling and traveling teamsters—associations which nearby residents may have wished to be forgotten.|$|E

40|$|Biological {{functions}} of compounds can be predicted from similarity of their chemical structures to discover new compounds for drug development. Molecular similarity {{can also be}} used to infer unknown functions and side effects of existing drugs. A multitude of molecular similarity methods based on different molecular representations have been used to perform virtual screenings. The molecules are transformed into descriptors to create a chemical database which allows mathematical manipulation and searching of the chemical information contained in the molecules. In this research, a new Shape based Descriptor of Molecule (SBDM) was developed based on the 2 -dimensional shape of a chemical compound. The outline shape of a molecule is split into parts that are related in graph connectivity. The first atom in the molecule is determined using the Morgan algorithm. The molecular features, such as atom <b>name,</b> <b>bond</b> type, angle and rings are represented using specific symbols based on some specification rules. Subsequent atoms are scanned in a clockwise direction with respect to the first atom. The scan is repeated until the first atom is reached again. Two similarity measures were used to evaluate the performance of the molecular descriptors, which are the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and the Tanimoto coefficient. The performance of the SBDM is compared with six standard molecular descriptors. Simulation of virtual screening experiments with the MDL Drug Data Report database show the superiority of the shape-based descriptor, with 19. 32 % and 34. 13 % in terms of average recall rates for the top of 1 % and 5 % retrieved molecules, respectively, compared to the six standard descriptors mentioned earlier...|$|E

50|$|Born in Jacksonville, Florida, Bonds {{lived in}} Norfolk, Virginia, in the 1950s {{when he began}} singing {{publicly}} in church and with {{a group called the}} Turks.
