40|$|The anti-amoebic {{effects of}} crude {{methanol}} extracts of Piper longum fruit, Piper sarmentosum root and Quercus infectoria <b>nut</b> <b>gall</b> against Entamoeba histolytica infecting the caecum of mice were studied. Caecal amoebiasis in mice was induced by injection of Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites {{directly into the}} caecum. The mice were then treated orally with the extract, a standard drug (metronidazole), or vehicle p. o. for five consecutive days, beginning 24 h after the infection and were examined on the sixth day. At a dose of 1000 mg/kg per day, the extracts of Piper longum fruit, Piper sarmentosum root and Quercus infectoria <b>nut</b> <b>gall</b> had a curative rate of 100, 40 and 26 %, respectively. At a concentration of 500 and 250 mg/kg/day, extract from Piper longum fruit was still effective in 93 and 46 % of the cases, respectively, while extract from Piper sarmentosum root at a dose of less than 1000 mg/kg per day did not cure any mice from amoebiasis. Extract of Quercus infectoria <b>nut</b> <b>gall</b> at a concentration of 500 and of 250 mg/kg per day cured 26 and 13 % of mice, respectively. Metronidazole at a concentration of 125 and of 62. 5 mg/kg per day had a curative rate of 100 and 60 %, respectively. The severity of caecal wall ulceration was reduced in mice which received the extract and metronidazole {{as compared to the}} control animals...|$|E
50|$|Tannins {{comprise}} {{a large group}} of natural products widely distributed in the plant kingdom. They have a great structural diversity, but are usually divided into two basic groups: the hydrolyzable type and the condensed type. Hydrolyzable tannins include the commonly occurring gallic and ellagic acid contained in the <b>nut</b> <b>galls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hydrolyzable tannins {{are present}} in many {{different}} plant species but are found in particularly high concentrations in <b>nut</b> <b>galls</b> growing on Rhus semialata (Chinese and Korean gallotannins) and Quercus infectoria (Turkish and Chinese gallotannins), the seedpods of Caesalpinia spinosa (Tara tannins), and the fruits of Terminalia chebula. The gallic and ellagic acid hydrolyzable tannins react with proteins to produce typical tanning effects; medicinally, this is important to topically treat inflamed or ulcerated tissues.They also contribute {{to most of the}} astringent property of manjakani and in small insignificant doses, are great for skin whitening and killing microorganisms.|$|R
50|$|Iron gall ink (also {{known as}} iron <b>gall</b> <b>nut</b> ink, oak <b>gall</b> ink, and common ink) is a purple-black or brown-black ink made from iron salts and tannic acids from {{vegetable}} sources. It was the standard writing and drawing ink in Europe, from about the 5th {{century to the}} 19th century, and remained in use well into the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Gall-nuts {{were also}} used for making fine black writing ink. Iron gall ink (also known as iron <b>gall</b> <b>nut</b> ink or oak gall ink) was a purple-black or brown-black ink made from iron salts and tannic acids from <b>gall</b> <b>nut.</b> It was the {{standard}} writing and drawing ink in Europe, from about the 12th century to the 19th century, and remained in use well into the 20th century.|$|R

His father Fadheel Afas was a merchant in Mosul (Ninevah). The family name came from processing the <b>Gall</b> <b>Nuts</b> and extracting the juice to tan the leather.|$|R
30|$|Art {{technological}} source research {{carried out}} {{as part of}} the InkCor project shows that, in most of the 253 recipes analysed (written or printed between 1000 and 1900), the iron (II) sulphate: <b>gall</b> <b>nuts</b> ratio varies between 1 : 4 and 4 : 1 in weight, with “an emphasis on proportions 6 : 6, 6 : 4, 6 : 3, 6 : 2 ” [2]. In this project, two historically representative model inks were proposed, based on “Aleppo” <b>gall</b> <b>nuts</b> with a low and a high copper content [2]. The first model ink displays the following ratio 1 : 1 : 0.5 for gall: vitriol: gum arabic in weight; in the vitriol, the copper sulphate, admixed with iron (II) sulphate is present in 0.01 % in weight [2]. The Iberian recipes proportions are in agreement with this data, and the closest to the model historical ink with lower copper content is, possibly, Braga’s.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIron gall inks {{consist of}} a mixture of vitriol, <b>gall</b> <b>nut</b> {{extracts}} and gum arabic. The association of the iron(II) sulphate present in vitriols, and the carboxyphenolic acids present in <b>gall</b> <b>nut</b> extracts leads {{to the formation of}} dark coloured iron-based precipitates. In order to evaluate the percentage of iron used in the formation of these precipitates, transmission Mössbauer spectroscopy (MS) measurements were performed on laboratory made inks at room temperature. These were completed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy measurements. The samples consisted of several solutions of iron(II) sulphate, gallic acid and gum arabic. After evaporation, the residues were analysed. Up to eight different Mössbauer signatures were detected, most of them correlated to iron sulphates. The Mössbauer signature of the iron gall precipitate was also isolated. It is not distinctly defined and may overlap with the signatures of iron(III) hydroxy-sulphates, such as jarosite or copiapite. Raman spectrometry then proved to be a useful complementary technique for the identification of the precipitate...|$|R

50|$|Different {{types of}} ink were known in antiquity, usually {{prepared}} from soot and gum, and later also from <b>gall</b> <b>nuts</b> and iron vitriol. This gave writing a brownish black color, but black or brown {{were not the}} only colors used. There are texts written in red or even gold, and different colors were used for illumination. For very luxurious manuscripts the whole parchment was colored purple, and the text was written on it with gold or silver (for example, Codex Argenteus).|$|R
25|$|Oak marble galls {{develop as}} a {{chemically}} induced distortion of leaf buds on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) or their hybrid Quercus × rosacea, trees, {{caused by the}} parthenogenetic gall wasp (Andricus kollari, (Hartig, 1843)) which lays eggs within leaf buds using their ovipositor.

30|$|All {{the recipes}} share three common raw materials: <b>gall</b> <b>nuts,</b> iron {{sulphate}} (in historical recipes named azije and/or caparrosa), and gum arabic. The galls and the metal ion produce dark inks, perceived as black, while the agglutinant facilitates its {{use as a}} written vehicle (by maintaining the complex dispersed in solution), Table  3. For all the ink recipes, {{a decrease in the}} pH was observed following the addition of iron sulphate, likewise in the references, Tables  1 and 2. This was expected considering that, in a very fast first step, Fe 2 + binds to the catechol ring; this binding implies a deprotonation and with it an increase in the concentration of H+ [8].|$|R

50|$|The legally {{required}} {{method of}} cleaning and preparing klaf has been altered over the centuries. During Talmudic times, salt-water and barley (or flours) were sprinkled on the skins {{which were then}} soaked in the juice of afatsim (<b>gall</b> <b>nuts,</b> or Oak apples). Nowadays, most processors dip the skins in clear water for two days, and then soak them in limewater for nine days to remove the hair. When it is a hairless surface, the scribe stretches it on a wooden drying frame and scrapes it until it is dry. Creases are ironed out with presses. Then it is sanded until it becomes a flat, smooth sheet fit for writing. The reasons for the change in this process are lengthy and controversial. Today, a few Jewish scribes still prepare klaf in precise accordance with the Jewish Law.|$|R
