5|$|The last tenet, '{{socialism}}', did {{not mean}} socialism as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form of Arab socialism. Aflaq coined the word Arab socialism for his variant of socialism. Socialism, in its original form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, first come into being {{under the rule of}} Muhammad. The point of Arab socialism was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> questions such as: how much state control was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab socialism was a system that freed the Arab people from oppression and enslavement, which in turn created independent individuals.|$|E

The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed that, {{if she were to}} admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the hospital on 12 July for a tetanus injection, Behan was arrested by five policemen and taken to their Arcidosso barracks for questioning. He {{did not know what}} was happening at first as the police had no interpreter in the barracks. He was only provided with a lawyer and interpreter 15 hours later when a magistrate from Grosseto came. Behan exercised his right <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> questions. He was released, but was formally informed that he was under suspicion. As of 15 July 2008 he was the only suspect in the case. The police subsequently seized his car and a knife from his home, and secured a room in the house in which traces of blood were allegedly found. In addition, shoe prints found were said to have matched his footwear. Custody of his car and home (except for the cellar) were returned to him on 14 July by the judge overseeing the investigation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the conquest, the main Mam {{population}} was situated in Xinabahul (also spelled Chinabjul), now the city of Huehuetenango, but Zaculeu's fortifications led to its use as a refuge during the conquest. The refuge was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, in 1525, with 40 Spanish cavalry and 80 Spanish infantry, and some 2,000 Mexican and K'iche' allies. Gonzalo de Alvarado left the Spanish camp at Tecpán Guatemala in July 1525 and marched to the town of Totonicapán, which he used as a supply base. From Totonicapán the expedition headed north to Momostenango, although it was delayed by heavy rains. Momostenango quickly fell to the Spanish after a four-hour battle. The following day Gonzalo de Alvarado marched on Huehuetenango and was confronted by a Mam army of 5,000 warriors from nearby Malacatán (modern Malacatancito). The Mam army advanced across the plain in battle formation and was met by a Spanish cavalry charge that threw them into disarray, with the infantry mopping up those Mam that survived the cavalry. Gonzalo de Alvarado slew the Mam leader Canil Acab with his lance, at which point the Mam army's resistance was broken, and the surviving warriors fled to the hills. Alvarado entered Malacatán unopposed to find it occupied only by the sick and the elderly. Messengers from the community's leaders arrived from the hills and offered their unconditional surrender, which was accepted by Alvarado. The Spanish army rested for a few days, then continued onwards to Huehuetenango only to find it deserted. Kayb'il B'alam had received news of the Spanish advance and had withdrawn to his fortress at Zaculeu. Alvarado sent a message to Zaculeu proposing terms for the peaceful surrender of the Mam king, who chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E

Big in mind and in body, he was incapable of little meanness. He admired a beautiful woman as he admired every other beautiful thing God has given us; and his delight over one was as keen, as boyish, as grateful over any others.|$|E
25|$|After viewing a question, the {{contestant}} {{can leave}} the game with the money already won rather than attempting an answer. If the contestant answers a question incorrectly, then all of their winnings are lost, except that the £1,000 and £32,000 prizes are guaranteed: if a player gets a question wrong above these levels, then the prize drops to the previous guaranteed prize. Answering the £2,000 and £64,000 questions wrong does not reduce the prize money. The prizes are generally non-cumulative; that is, answering a question correctly does not result in the amount being played for being added to the amount already won, rather the amount already won is written off and replaced by a larger sum, usually twice as large. The game ends when the contestant answers a question incorrectly, decides <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> a question, or answers all questions correctly.|$|E
25|$|But {{his enemies}} were not merely those whose errors he had exposed and whose hostility he had {{excited by the}} {{violence}} of his language. The results of his method of historical criticism threatened the Catholic controversialists and the authenticity {{of many of the}} documents on which they relied. The Jesuits, who aspired to be the source of all scholarship and criticism, saw the writings and authority of Scaliger as a formidable barrier to their claims. Muret {{in the latter part of}} his life professed the strictest orthodoxy, Lipsius had been reconciled to the Church of Rome, Isaac Casaubon was supposed to be wavering, but Scaliger was known to be an irreconcilable Protestant. As long as his intellectual supremacy was unquestioned, the Protestants had the advantage in learning and scholarship. His enemies therefore aimed, if <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> his criticisms or to disprove his statements, yet to attack him as a man and to destroy his reputation. This was no easy task, for his moral character was strong.|$|E

25|$|In August 2015, it was {{reported}} that Clinton had personally paid a State Department staffer, Bryan Pagliano, who had previously served as IT director for Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, to maintain her private server while she was Secretary of State. According to a Clinton campaign official, this ensured that taxpayer dollars would not be spent on a private server that was shared by Clinton, her husband and their daughter, as well as several aides to the former president. On September 1, 2015, Pagliano's attorney sent letters to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which had subpoenaed Pagliano, and to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was inquiring about Pagliano's outside employment while a Federal employee, informing the committees that his client would invoke his constitutional Fifth Amendment rights <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> any questions from the committees, and on September 10, in a closed-door session before the Benghazi Committee, Pagliano personally appeared to invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to testify before the committee.|$|E
25|$|Rail World's {{president}} and CEO Edward Burkhardt visited the town on July 10, 2013, and was heckled by residents. After the accident, the railway's safety record was called into question: {{over the previous}} decade the firm recorded a higher accident rate {{than the rest of}} the U.S. rail fleet, according to data from the Federal Railroad Administration. In the previous year, the railroad had 36.1 accidents per million miles travelled, in comparison to a national average of 14.6 accidents. Burkhardt's historical involvement with a 1996 derailment on the Wisconsin Central in which hazardous materials burned for over two weeks also drew renewed scrutiny. While the actual cause of the disaster was still under provincial (Sûreté du Québec) and federal (Transportation Safety Board) investigation, Burkhardt announced the railway had suspended the engineer for allegedly improperly setting the handbrakes on the rail cars. The engineer was made unavailable at the suggestion of his lawyer and MMA instructed its employees <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> questions from police without first consulting the company's lawyers. A former colleague established an Albany-based legal defence fund for the engineer. The Sûreté du Québec raided MMA offices in Farnham on July 25 as part of a criminal investigation into the Lac-Mégantic fatalities; the Transportation Safety Board conducted its own search backed by RCMP on August 1.|$|E

500|$|Islam is {{the second}} largest {{religion}} in the country. In the 2011 census, 1.9% of the census population (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is stated as being unreliable because {{a disproportionate number of}} adherents of this religion (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the question. Figures from Religionswissenschaftlicher Medien- und Informationsdienst suggest a figure of [...] 4.4 to 4.7 million (around 5.5% of the population) in 2015. A study conducted by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees found that between 2011 and 2015 the Muslim population rose by 1.2 million people, mostly due to immigration. Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Titanium" [...] was {{directed}} by David Wilson. It was filmed in December 2011 in Sainte-Marthe-sur-le-Lac and at Dorval-Jean XXIII High School, {{in the province of}} Quebec, Canada. A 14-second preview of the video was uploaded to Guetta's official YouTube account on December 16, 2011. The preview showed a young boy (played by actor Ryan Lee) in the smoky woods running away from a SWAT team of men. The video then closes with the caption, [...] "The Music Video Coming Soon". The full video premiered online on December 20, 2011. Neither Guetta nor Sia appear in the video. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine noted that [...] "the supernatural scene and suburban setting" [...] in the video recall the science fiction film Super 8 (2011), in which Lee stars. Becky Bain of Idolator wrote that, [...] "The video is beautifully shot, and is courageous enough <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> all its mysteries."

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps {{rated the}} episode an A-, finding it [...] "almost like an {{extension}} of the pilot". Phipps felt the scene featuring Mulder's kidnapping to be [...] "one of the scariest moments from the series' early days, as much for what it suggests as for what it shows". Writing for website Den of Geek, Matt Haigh reviewed the episode positively, praising its decision <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> all of the questions that it asks. Haigh noted that [...] "the fact that we are left as clueless about what really happened as Mulder and Scully only enhances the viewing experience", finding such mystery to be [...] "a rare thing indeed" [...] on network television. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, finding it to be [...] "much more confident in its pacing and tone" [...] than the previous episode. Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode was [...] "a skilfully scripted story of cover-up and paranoia", and noted that [...] "it sets up the overall themes of the show so well, it almost seems like a primer".|$|E
