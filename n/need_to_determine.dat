25|$|A woman {{experiencing}} uterine blood {{not part}} of normal menstruation was classified as a zavah {{in the days of}} the Temple in Jerusalem and remained in a state of ritual impurity for 7 days prior to immersion. Today, the law of zavah remains in effect in Orthodox Judaism, in two respects. Due to extreme conditions in Roman Palestine in the time of the Amoraim, women's periods became irregular, and women became unable to determine whether or not their discharges were regular (niddah) or irregular (zavah). As a result, women adapted a stringency combining the niddah and zavah periods, refraining from intercourse and physical contact with their husbands for seven days of the zavah period following menstruation, for a total of approximately 12 days per month, which Orthodox women continue to observe today. The laws of zavah are also applied, as in Biblical times, to uterine blood discharges outside regular menstruation. Such circumstances are often interpreted leniently, however, and rabbinic stratagems have been devised to lessen their severity. Women experiencing irregularities (droplets) are sometimes advised to wear coloured underwear to mitigate the detectability of evidence of zavah status and hence a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> that a woman is a zavah.|$|E
500|$|Some of the show's {{plots and}} ideas {{are drawn from}} the lives of both creators' daughters; the {{decision}} to have Ron eventually join his school's football team was inspired by Schooley's daughter being involved in her high school band, which resulted in them attending several school football matches. Citing Ron as his favorite character, McCorkle admitted that he reminds him {{of his high school}} self. Although not as strong an action hero as Kim, {{at the same time the}} creators were careful to highlight Ron's courage and attributes by emphasizing the fact that he constantly finds himself in dangerous situations. By the fourth and final season, the writers had taken into consideration male fans' requests to see Ron succeed more often than he had in earlier seasons, developing him into a more confident character as he gradually [...] "come into his own" [...] and becomes more of a partner than a sidekick. Drakken and Shego's relationship [...] "weirdly" [...] mirrors Kim and Ron's to some extent, with the female character remaining smarter and more competent than her fumbling male teammate. Initially envisioned as a [...] "standard sidekick", Sullivan's sarcastic interpretation of Shego ultimately inspired Schooley and McCorkle to expand upon the humor revolving around the fact that Shego is barely able to tolerate Drakken. The creators had always intended for Kim and Ron to eventually become romantically involved but avoided this storyline in fear of [...] "paint ourselves in a corner", citing Sam and Diane's ill-fated relationship in the sitcom Cheers as an example. Throughout the first three seasons, the idea of Ron having feelings for Kim is alluded to, but he never pursues them for various reasons. Production on new episodes of Kim Possible had virtually ceased by the end of Season 3 when Kim and Ron finally become a couple, which McCorkle felt had ended the series perfectly in the film , thus initially eliminating any <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how they were to proceed with them as a new couple. However, when the series was surprisingly renewed for a fourth season, Schooley and McCorkle were forced to confronted the challenge of writing for Kim and Ron as a couple for the first time but eventually grew to appreciate their [...] "new dynamic", which provided the show with [...] "new life" [...] while allowing the writers to explore previously uncharted comedic territory. In fact, fans' interest in the new power couple's relationship was one of the main reasons the show was renewed. Schooley and McCorkle returned from other projects they had begun working on to complete the series.|$|E

Following news that Microsoft Studios was serving as a publisher for the Xbox One version as a [...] "console launch exclusive" [...] in August 2017, reporters questioned Bluehole about their PlayStation 4 plans, but Bluehole did not confirm either way on current plans for this platform. In an interview shortly after Gamescom, Greene said that their deal with Microsoft did not exclude a PlayStation 4 port, but that their focus {{at the time was}} only on the Windows and Xbox One version, given the small size of their team.

2500|$|On February 17, 2017, SB 562, {{which is}} also known as [...] "The Healthy California Act" [...] was {{introduced}} to the California State Senate. This bill is a $400 billion plan that was sponsored by the California Nurses Association to implement single-payer healthcare in California. Under this bill, which was co-authored by State Senators Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) and Toni Atkins (D-San Diego), Californians would have health coverage without having to pay any premiums, co-pays, or deductibles. All California residents will be covered in the Healthy Care Act SB 562 regardless of their immigration status. The Health Care Act will also include transient students that attend California institutions whom, purchased their healthcare program through the school. Services that will be covered by the Healthy Care Act will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> as medically necessary by the patientâ€™s chosen health care provider. These services will range from Preventable services to Emergency services, in addition to prescription drugs services. The bill passed in the State Senate on June 1, 2017 with a vote of 23-14. When the bill was sent to the State Assembly, it did not get approved and was put on hold since there were flaws that did not address issues like how to fund for this bill and how care would be delivered to patients. Although the bill is currently put on hold, it hopes to be revived next year in 2018.|$|E

6000|$|A {{phrase of}} Edward Garnett's is, {{as a matter}} of fact, {{responsible}} for this book. The first of the friends I made for myself by my pen it was but natural that he should be the recipient, at that time, of my confidences. One evening when we had dined together and he had listened to the account of my perplexities (I fear he must have been growing a little tired of them) he pointed out that there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> my future absolutely. Then he added: [...] "You have the style, you have the temperament; why not write another?" [...] I believe that as far as one man may wish to influence another man's life Edward Garnett had a great desire that I should go on writing. At that time, and I may say, ever afterwards, he was always very patient and gentle with me. What strikes me most however in the phrase quoted above which was offered to me in a tone of detachment is not its gentleness but its effective wisdom. Had he said, [...] "Why not go on writing," [...] it is very probable he would have scared me away from pen and ink for ever; but there was nothing either to frighten one or arouse one's antagonism in the mere suggestion to [...] "write another." [...] And thus a dead point in the revolution of my affairs was insidiously got over. The word [...] "another" [...] did it. At about eleven o'clock of a nice London night, Edward and I walked along interminable streets talking of many things, and I remember that on getting home I sat down and wrote about half a page of [...] "An Outcast of the Islands" [...] before I slept. This was committing myself definitely, I won't say to another life, but to another book. There is apparently something in my character which will not allow me to abandon for good any piece of work I have begun. I have laid aside many beginnings. I have laid them aside with sorrow, with disgust, with rage, with melancholy and even with self-contempt; but even at the worst I had an uneasy consciousness that I would {{have to go back to}} them.|$|E
