40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{experiment}} was to answer the que:Aion wnether broad or <b>narrow</b> <b>terms</b> function most effectively in the retrieval of relevant documents. The answer depends on waat the user of the retrieval system wants, his wants being expressed in term of _stated pzecision-recail preference, or by {{the exact number of}} relevant documents he wishes to retrieve. Depth of indexing does not contribute significantly to effective retrieval. Documents should be indexed with broad terms to satisfy recall preferences with <b>narrow</b> <b>terms</b> to satisfy precision preferences since the amount of material retrieved in a system is not a simple function of the total numbers of terms posted to documents in the collection. At high cut-off values the retrieval power of broad and <b>narrow</b> <b>terms</b> tends to become equalized. Precision can be improved through raising the cut-off point and deleting broad terms. Experiments with weighted indexing provided poor results, and with title-term indexing gave inconclusive results. (AB...|$|R

5000|$|PSH is a tree {{structure}} with 44 thematic sections. Subject headings {{are included in}} a hierarchy of six (or seven) levels according to their semantic content and specificity. There are hierarchical, associative ("see also") and equivalence ("see") relations in PSH. Hierarchical relations are represented by broader and <b>narrower</b> <b>terms</b> (e.g. physical diagnostic methods is broader term to electrocardiography, {{and on the other}} hand, electrocardiography is <b>narrower</b> <b>term</b> to physical diagnostic methods). Equivalence relations link subject headings with their nonpreferred versions (e.g. electrocardiography and ECG). Moreover, associative relations are used to link related subject headings from different parts of PSH, regardless their affiliation to a section, (e.g. electrocardiography: see also cardiology). Every subject heading belongs to just one section, which has its own two-character abbreviation, assigned to every subject heading of the section. This enables users to recognize affiliation of subject headings from lower levels to the thematic sections. The 44 thematic sections have following root nodes: ...|$|R
