5|$|As Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Schuman was {{instrumental}} in turning French policy away from the Gaullist policy of permanent occupation or control of parts of German territory such as the Ruhr or the Saar. Despite stiff ultra-nationalist, Gaullist and communist opposition, the French Assembly voted a number of resolutions in favour of his <b>new</b> <b>policy</b> of integrating Germany into a community. The International Authority for the Ruhr changed in consequence. Schuman's guiding principles were moral, based on the equality of states (international democracy), not the power politics of domination.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the veneration of icons in March 843, the Byzantine Empire's government, headed by the Empress-regent Theodora and the logothetes Theoktistos, embarked on a sustained assault on the Byzantines' main political and ideological foe, the Abbasid Caliphate and its dependencies. This aggressive stance was on the one hand facilitated by the internal stability {{that the end of the}} Iconoclasm controversy brought, and on the other encouraged by a desire to vindicate the <b>new</b> <b>policy</b> through military victories against the Muslims.|$|E

The act also required each park to produce a management plan, with greater public participation.|$|E

5|$|A {{new system}} of {{controlling}} {{the movement of the}} First Nations was introduced by the government after the rebellion. Known as the pass system, this required any individual leaving a reserve to possess a pass signed by a government agent, or to face arrest by the police. The police received advice that the <b>new</b> <b>policy</b> was illegal, as it contravened Treaty 7, which had given guarantees of free movement, but they continued to enforce it for several years. Eventually the force turned to the vagrancy laws as an alternative approach for removing First Nations from selected areas. Police used agents employed to collect intelligence from within First Nation and Métis communities, and, from 1887, they also employed members of the First Nations as special constables, typically deploying them as scouts and trackers. These scouts wore an informal uniform and were empowered to arrest other members of their communities, but not whites.|$|E

Terry Myerson stated that Microsoft {{did not want to}} make further {{investments}} in optimizing older versions of Windows and associated software for newer generations of processors. These policies were criticized by the media, who especially noted that Microsoft was refusing to support newer hardware (particularly Intel's Skylake CPUs, which was also originally targeted by the <b>new</b> <b>policy</b> with a premature end of support that was ultimately retracted) on Windows 8.1, a version of Windows that is still in mainstream support until January 2018.|$|E
40|$|This {{note about}} work in {{progress}} suggests <b>new</b> <b>policies</b> for combinatorial online optimization problems where requests have to be served and the longterm objective is a sophisticated combination of request based cost (quality of service) and service based cost (operational cost). Examples are the online dispatching of automobile service units or the online control of cargo elevators. The <b>new</b> <b>policies</b> are reoptimization policies that do not use any (stochastic) information about future requests. For the first time, the <b>new</b> <b>policies</b> enhance reoptimization with a flow time guarantee, depending on the load in the system. In this sense, the <b>new</b> <b>policies</b> add fairness to reoptimization at a small cost: In the elevator control problem, e. g., the average performance w. r. t. the long-term objective function in simulation experiments only slightly worse than plain reoptimization for various long-term objectives...|$|R

5|$|China has {{installed}} a grassroots network of officials throughout Xinjiang, its predominantly Muslim north-west frontier region, to address social risks and spot {{early signs of}} unrest: Hundreds of cadres have been transferred from southern Xinjiang, the region’s poorest area, into socially unstable neighbourhoods of Ürümqi; a policy has been implemented where if all family members are unemployed, the government arranges for {{one person in the}} household to get a job,; official announcements are calling upon university students to register for those payouts. The areas around slums are being redeveloped to reduce social risks, opening way to new apartment blocks. However, independent observers believe that fundamental inequalities need to be addressed, and the mindset must change for there to be any success; Ilham Tohti warned that the <b>new</b> <b>policy</b> could attract more Han immigration, and further alienate the Uyghur population.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{that the}} NEP had retarded {{economic}} growth were dismissed; it was posited that the NEP {{had managed to}} avert further racial rioting, which would have hurt economic growth more than the NEP. The NEP was also defended as having created a Malay middle class and improving standards of living without compromising the non-Bumiputra share {{of the economy in}} absolute terms; statistics indicated that the Chinese and Indian middle classes also grew under the NEP, albeit not as much as the Malays'. The overall Malaysian poverty rate had shrunk from 50% at independence to 7%. It was also argued that ethnic stereotypes had been largely stamped out due to the NEP's success in creating a Malay upper class. Although many of the NEP's goals were restated by the NDP, the <b>new</b> <b>policy</b> appeared to be geared more towards wealth retention and creation, as opposed to simple redistribution. Nevertheless, many of the policies from the NEP era were retained under the NDP, which was set to expire in 2020.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 {{there were}} 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were {{operated}} {{by the government and}} 45 were private.

As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The <b>new</b> <b>policy</b> has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available.

5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War the NUWSS spent its time in north Wales organising educational and propaganda campaigns. In south Wales friction was caused by a shift in political views pushed onto the country from the central office. 1912 saw the NUWSS switch its policy as a non-party organisation to set up the Election Fighting Fund (EFF) to support the newly burgeoning Labour Party. Wales had traditionally been a Liberal heartland and the South Wales Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies was opposed to this <b>new</b> <b>policy.</b> There was a sense that there was a disjoint between the central 'English feminist agenda' pushed by the militant headquarters and the needs of Welsh social, cultural and political views. The strains existed between the two organisation until the EFF was abandoned in 1914.|$|E

This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a <b>new</b> <b>policy,</b> is seen as an expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging. The aim is to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.|$|E

5|$|The USAF {{issued a}} <b>new</b> <b>policy</b> {{directive}} regarding {{the handling of}} nuclear weapons and delivery systems, which prohibits the storing of nuclear armed and nonnuclear armed weapons in the same storage facility. The directive further instructs that all nonnuclear munitions and missiles must be labeled with placards clearly stating that they are not armed with nuclear warheads. Wing commanders are now charged with approving any movement of nuclear weapons from weapons storage areas and must appoint a single individual as a munitions accountability system officer and weapons custodian. All units that handle nuclear weapons must develop a coordinated visual inspection checklist. The policy further directs that airmen charged with handling or maintaining nuclear weapons cannot be on duty for longer than 12 hours, unless during an emergency, when their duty period can be extended to a maximum of 16 hours. The USAF has since instituted a program of surprise inspections at nuclear-armed bases.|$|E
5|$|The army group's {{previous}} commander, Georg von Küchler, had {{pleaded for}} permission to withdraw to the Panther Line in Estonia, which was still only half-completed at that stage.

Under this doctrine, ground would only temporarily be ceded, to gather reserves for an immediate counter-attack that would drive the Red Army back and relieve pressure on {{other areas of the}} front. These statements of aggressive intent won over Hitler and OKH, who had no substantial reserves to send him, but were still unwilling to lose territory. Historians have since debated their significance, some claiming that Shield and Sword was Hitler's invention, while others say they were a calculated ploy by Model to disguise his true intent—to pull back to the Panther Line.|$|E

As a consequence, the achievement of stated policy goals is often compromised. This finding challenges the belief that the introduction of new management practices in the 1990 s has changed the way all public-sector managers implement <b>new</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R
