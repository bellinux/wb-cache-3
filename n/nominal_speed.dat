The centerline propulsion motor, located in a separate compartment, was a tandem unit consisting of two 5,500hp motors while the port and starboard propulsion motors, located side-by-side in the same compartment, were rated at 5,500hp each. While the <b>nominal</b> <b>speed</b> of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all revolution speeds between 110 and 150 rpm.

The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder.|$|E

A semi-discretization scheme is used to discretize the system over one period, and the infinite-dimensional transition matrix is reduced to a finite-dimensional matrix over this period. The eigenvalues of this finite-dimensional matrix provide information on VSS milling stability with respect to control parameters, such as the axial depth of cut and the <b>nominal</b> spindle <b>speed.</b> The stability charts obtained for VSS milling operations are compared with those obtained for constant spindle speed milling operations, and the benefits of VSS milling operations are discussed...|$|R
