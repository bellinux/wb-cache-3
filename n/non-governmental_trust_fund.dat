5000|$|Both Social Security and Medicare {{are funded}} by payroll tax {{revenues}} dedicated to those programs. Program tax revenues historically have exceeded payouts, resulting in program surpluses {{and the building}} of <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> balances. The <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> earn interest. Both Social Security and Medicare each have two component <b>trust</b> <b>funds.</b> As of FY2008, Social Security had a combined $2.4 trillion <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> balance and Medicare's was $380 billion. If during an individual year program payouts exceed the sum of tax income and interest earned during that year (i.e., an annual program deficit), the <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> for the program is drawn down {{to the extent of}} the shortfall. Legally, the mandatory nature of these programs compels the government to fund them to the extent of tax income plus any remaining <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> balances, borrowing as needed.

40|$|Excerpt] Each {{year when}} the Social Security {{trustees}} release their annual report, {{attention is focused on}} the projection of the year that the Social Security <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> will become insolvent. In their 2014 report, the Trustees projected that, under their intermediate assumptions and under current law, the Disability Insurance (DI) <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> will become exhausted in 2016 and the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> will do so in 2034. Although the two funds are legally separate, they are often described in combination. The trustees project that the combined Social Security <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> will become exhausted in 2033. Some Americans may believe that if the <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> were exhausted, Social Security would be unable to pay any benefits. In fact, in 2033, the first year of projected insolvency of the combined Social Security <b>trust</b> <b>funds,</b> the program is projected to have enough tax revenue to pay about 77 % of scheduled benefits; that percentage would decline to 72 % {{by the end of the}} 75 -year projection period. Although benefits would be paid in some form, it is unclear how the necessary reductions would be implemented, because the Social Security Act does not specify what would happen to benefits if a <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> became exhausted. One option would be to pay full benefit checks on a delayed schedule; another would be to make timely but reduced payments. This report explains what the Social Security <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> are and how they work.
