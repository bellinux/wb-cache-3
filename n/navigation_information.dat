Since October 2010, the first coach of every train is reserved for women. However, last coaches are also reserved when the train changes tracks at the terminal stations in the Red, Green and Violet Lines. To make travelling by metro a smoother experience, Delhi Metro has launched its own official app for smartphone users,(iPhone and Android) that will provide information on various facilities like nearest metro station, fare, parking availability, tourist spots near metro stations, security and emergency helpline numbers.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the role of rapid-fire presentation of images {{in the service of}} <b>navigation</b> in <b>information</b> spaces. We presume a model of <b>information</b> <b>navigation</b> in which the user performs a cycle of (pre) viewing, selecting, and moving. Our hypothesis is that images presented to the user in rapid succession can significantly enhance the previewing step, thus optimizing the selection step and improving navigability. We discuss two prototypes for navigation tools in Web information spaces in which images are used as the primary means for presenting meta-information about "upcoming " Web pages. The presentation is modeled as a flow of information streaming to the user, and orientation is visualized through positions in ordered sequences.
