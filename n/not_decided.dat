The decision elicited mixed reactions from both fans of the contest and participating broadcasters.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the Commercial Import Program (CIP) {{appeared}} to be working successfully and North Vietnam had <b>not</b> <b>decided</b> to attack the South after Diệm had canceled the planned 1956 reunification elections. The glowing press coverage of the period contrasted {{to that of the}} later decades of the 1960s and 1970s, in which the American media engaged in investigative journalism that undermined the official line presented by Washington in relation to Vietnam. This was particularly true during Diệm's downfall in 1963. Journalists such as David Halberstam, Malcolm Browne and Neil Sheehan all won Pulitzer Prizes for their work on the Buddhist crisis, in which mass protests erupted after years of discrimination against the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{deployment}} there was controversy about the government's non-resolution of repatriation entitlements and peacekeeper coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, {{and it had}} <b>not</b> <b>decided</b> if {{the deployment}} would be considered operational service. The pay and allowance issues were resolved; many other conditions-of-service issues were identified, but not resolved. During the deployment few issues were brought to Parliament's attention, although the issue of mail censorship was raised. During the second contingent's rotation, the soldiers' families had a full-time welfare officer tasked with supporting them.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, the Oslo City Council {{voted to}} close the street tramway and replace all routes with either diesel buses or the Oslo Metro. The {{specific}} plans for the Ekeberg Line were <b>not</b> <b>decided,</b> although the line was considered either to be a stand-alone light rail or connected to the metro. From 30 October 1960, the route for the Ekeberg Line trams in the city changed, so they instead followed the route Schweigaards gate – Vognmannsgata – Jernbanetorget – Kirkeristen to Stortorvet instead of the old route via Grønland and Brugata. From 1963, the route terminated at Jernbanetorget, after {{the rest of the}} route was closed due to the construction of the metro.|$|E

5|$|Jerry Goldsmith had {{composed}} {{the music for}} The Motion Picture, but {{was not an option}} for The Wrath of Khan given the reduced budget; Meyer's composer for Time After Time, Miklós Rózsa, was likewise prohibitively expensive.

Meyer initially hoped to hire an associate named John Morgan, but Morgan lacked film experience, which would have troubled the studio.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{argued that}} the Federal Circuit's {{decision}} was correct because Bowman had created a new product that infringed on their patent. They further argued {{that this was not}} an appropriate case to hear, as the decision was <b>not</b> <b>decided</b> on patent exhaustion via a conditional sale. The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court, and the Solicitor General filed a brief generally in support of the Monsanto position. The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5, 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{settlement}} of state inheritance taxes on two estates also plagued Black. In the first case, Governor Stanley {{had made a}} compromise {{settlement of}} back taxes with L. V. Harkness before his death. The compromise was criticized, and although Black asked {{the attorney general to}} investigate, the case was <b>not</b> <b>decided</b> during Black's tenure as governor. In the second case, Stanley had appointed three special attorneys to collect inheritance taxes from the estate of Mrs. Robert Worth Bingham. Black wanted the attorneys to resign and save the state their large fees, but refused to remove them outright. This action was made more damning because one of the attorneys was a member of Black's campaign staff.|$|E
5|$|Daniels and Schur {{wrote the}} script for the pilot episode in mid-2008. The {{original}} script portrayed Leslie and Mark as slightly less likable than they appeared in the final draft. For example, in the premiere episode, Mark asks Ron to greenlight the park because he is inspired by Leslie's optimism and wants to help her. In the original script, Mark intervened because he was attracted to Ann and wanted an excuse to keep seeing her. The characters were made more likable in response to feedback the episode received from focus groups and press tour screenings. The first-season episodes were written and developed relatively quickly after each other, and Schur said the staff was treating the entire six-episode season {{as if it was}} one television pilot. When the season concluded, the writers had <b>not</b> <b>decided</b> what would happen with the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Mark and Ann.|$|E

5|$|Gjems-Onstad's {{cooperation}} with Hagen was however not to last. In early 1976 Gjems-Onstad voiced his discontent with the ever-ongoing conflicts within the party, {{and he had}} by mid-year <b>not</b> <b>decided</b> {{whether or not he}} wanted to run for re-election. He eventually felt squeezed out of the party, and wanted no part in the intriguing he considered Hagen to represent. He was replaced as parliamentary leader of the party at the start of October. After he in turn recommended voters to rather vote for the Conservative Party in an interview with Aftenposten, he was finally expelled from the party by a unanimously approved motion put forward by Carl I. Hagen later the same month. Gjems-Onstad finished his term as an independent.|$|E
5|$|Most World Fantasy Award nominees and {{winners are}} decided by {{attendees}} and judges {{of the annual}} World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which {{has the power to}} break ties. Unlike the other World Fantasy Award categories, the Convention Award has no nominees and is <b>not</b> <b>decided</b> in the usual way; instead, the winner is selected by the convention organizers themselves and announced along with the nominees in the other categories. The final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention at the end of October. Through 2015, winners were presented with a statuette of H.P.Lovecraft, but at the 2015 ceremony it was announced that the statuette would not be given out in future years. No announcement was made about a replacement award at that time.|$|E
5|$|Peterle conceded immediately. In {{his first}} statements, Peterle said his defeat was a {{vote against the}} ruling Janša government, {{and that he had}} {{expected}} a better result. He added, however, that he would have regretted it if he had <b>not</b> <b>decided</b> to run for the office. By midnight, unofficial results from the Electoral Commission gave Türk a lead of 68% vs. 32%. Türk won in all eight electoral units, with Peterle narrowly winning in only four of 88 electoral districts. Together with {{the second round of the}} election, a referendum on a law providing for the nationalization of citizens' share in the major national insurance company was held as well. Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law.|$|E

5|$|The book {{discusses}} related legal {{practices of}} countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany. Israel {{was the first}} country to publicly acknowledge the practice—in November 2000. The author connects this policy initiative with Israel's ongoing conflict with Palestinian militants. Melzer argues that this policy was controversial—the issue came before the Israeli Supreme Court, where the matter was <b>not</b> <b>decided</b> for almost five years. The court's judgment was issued on 14 December 2006, but neither forbade nor endorsed the practice. Melzer asserts that it left multiple important legal conundra unresolved. Its significance was that it dealt not with a single incident, but rather {{with the nature of}} the policy itself and set forth conditions for examining the legality of future episodes.|$|E
5|$|UConn {{started the}} season strong, winning their first five games. The Huskies easily won their first game 35–3 against Division I-Football Championship Subdivision (Division I-FCS) {{opponent}} Hofstra. The second game, at Temple, was played as {{the remnants of}} Hurricane Hanna hit Philadelphia. UConn won 12–9 in overtime as Donald Brown ran for a then-career high 214yards and scored the game-winning touchdown. Connecticut next avenged their loss to Virginia from 2007, winning the rematch 45–10. Baylor was next on the schedule; the Huskies pulled out the win in a back-and-forth game, 31–28. Connecticut opened Big East conference play in their next game against Louisville. The game was <b>not</b> <b>decided</b> until UConn linebacker Lawrence Wilson returned an interception for a touchdown with 2:45 left in the fourth quarter, giving the Huskies a 26–21 lead they would not relinquish. This was the second straight season where Connecticut won their first five games; before 2007, they had not opened a season so successfully since 1995, when they won their first six straight. Following the game, UConn achieved their first and only ranking of the year, appearing at No.24 in the Associated Press (AP) and Harris polls and No.23 in the Coaches' poll. However, starting quarterback Tyler Lorenzen broke his foot in the Louisville game; the Huskies {{would be forced to}} rely on backup Zach Frazer for the next few games.|$|E
