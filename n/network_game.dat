A total of 224,837 units were sold in Japan during 2001, with the game being listed by Dengeki Online as the 50th best-selling video game in the region for that year. The success of Mega Man Battle Network led to several sequels and spin-offs on other consoles, mobile phones, and arcade; an anime series; and numerous pieces of merchandise. A successor series called Mega Man Star Force began in 2006 after the Capcom decided to stop developing new Battle Network titles.

After airing thirteen episodes and reaching an audience of 15 million viewers {{by the end of}} the show's first week on the air, the program expanded to an hour-long format when it returned in November. The series, of which episodes were originally shown only a day after their initial taping, was promoted to regular status on January 18, 2000 and, at the height of its popularity, was airing on ABC five nights a week. The show was so popular during its original primetime run that rival networks created or re-incarnated game shows of their own (e.g., Greed, Twenty One, etc.), as well as importing various game shows of British and Australian origin to America (such as Winning Lines, Weakest Link, and It's Your Chance of a Lifetime).|$|E

40|$|<b>Networked</b> {{multiplayer}} <b>games</b> must {{support a}} much wider variety of interactions than single-player <b>games</b> because <b>networked</b> <b>games</b> involve communication and coordination between players. This means that designers must consider additional usability issues that relate to group play – but there are currently no usability engineering methods that are specifically oriented towards the needs of multiplayer games. To address this problem, we developed {{a new set of}} usability heuristics, called <b>Networked</b> <b>Game</b> Heuristics (NGH), which can be used in the design and evaluation of <b>networked</b> multiplayer <b>games.</b> The new heuristics were identified by analyzing problem reports from 382 reviews of <b>networked</b> PC <b>games,</b> covering six main genres. We aggregated problem reports into ten problem categories (covering issues from session management to cheating to training for novice players) and developed heuristics that describe how these usability problems can be avoided. We tested the new heuristics by having evaluators use them and an existing set to assess the usability of two <b>networked</b> <b>games.</b> Evaluators found more usability problems with NGH, and stated that the new heuristics were better for evaluating multiplayer game usability. Our research is the first to present <b>networked</b> <b>game</b> heuristics that are derived from real problem reports, and the first to evaluate the heuristics’ effectiveness in a realistic usability test...|$|R
