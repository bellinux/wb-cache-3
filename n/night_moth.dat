40|$|Flowers of Scabiosa columbaria (Dipsacaceae) are {{visited by}} {{a large number of}} insect species, generalists and one specialist. Per {{population}} one insect species or group was dominant. Syrphids, bumblebee males and the day-active <b>night</b> <b>moth</b> Autographa gamma were the most numerous visitors in Dutch populations. In French populations a number of butterfly species, honeybees and the specialist bee Dasypoda argentata were the most frequent visitors. The purity of the pollen loads on insect bodies was studied. Bumblebees, both workers and males, and syrphid flies carried a body load containing pollen of several plant species. The percentage of S. columbaria pollen was not larger than 22 percent. Butterflies carried {{a very small number of}} pollen grains. The specialist D. argentata and honeybees carried only S. columbaria pollen, the first species in very large numbers. Stigmas in populations visited by D. argentata and honeybees contained a very pure load of nearly only Scabiosa pollen. Stigmas in populations visited by bumblebees, syrphid flies and butterflies had up to 30 % Scabiosa pollen; a large variation of pollen from different plant species was found...|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} insect is {{probably}} the leaf cutting ant, but common sights are the termites with their innumerable termite hills covering the landscape, several species of spiders, wild bees, dung beetles, especially around the cattle ranches, enormous <b>night</b> <b>moths,</b> and the fireflies with their eerie nocturnal lights. One species of black spider lives in a compact group like a large ball during the daylight hours, their thick as fish line web stretching between large trees. At dusk the spiders scurry out from their cluster to take up positions on the long web and catch the nocturnal insects as they fly blindly to their fate.|$|R

60|$|Our host {{said that}} the frost, too, on the windows caused him much trouble, and in sultry summer <b>nights</b> the <b>moths</b> covered them and dimmed his lights; {{sometimes}} even small birds flew against the thick plate glass, and {{were found on the}} ground beneath in the morning with their necks broken. In the spring of 1855 he found nineteen small yellow-birds, perhaps goldfinches or myrtle-birds, thus lying dead around the light-house; and sometimes in the fall he had seen where a golden plover had struck the glass in the night, and left the down and the fatty part of its breast on it.|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{generation}}s {{per year in}} Tianjin, China. Mature larvae quit {{the fruits of their}} food plant before they are ripe and pupate on leaves or leaf litter. The pupal stage lasts from nine to twelve days. Adults of the second generation hibernate. Adults occur from May to the first ten days of June, and from the last ten days of June to the first ten days of August. Adults can emerge during the whole day, but the peak occurs in the morning. The mating occurs usually in the morning. At <b>night,</b> the <b>moths</b> are actively drinking nectar and ovipositing. A parasitic Ichneumonid species was reared from pupae collected in the field.|$|R

60|$|On arriving, I saw a {{troop of}} large monkeys* [Macacus Pelops? Hodgson. This is a very {{different}} species from the tropical kind seen in Nepal, and mentioned at vol. i, Chapter XII.] gambolling in a wood of Abies Brunoniana: this surprised me, as I was not prepared to find so tropical an animal associated with a vegetation typical of a boreal climate. The only other quadrupeds seen here were some small earless rats, and musk-deer; the young female of which latter sometimes afforded me a dish of excellent venison; being, though dark-coloured and lean, tender, sweet, and short-fibred. Birds were scarce, with the exception of alpine pigeons (Columba leuconota), red-legged crows (Corvus graculus, L.), and the horned pheasant (Meleagris Satyra, L.). In this month insects are scarce, Elater and a black earwig being the most frequent: two species of Serica also flew into my tent, and at <b>night</b> <b>moths,</b> closely resembling European ones, came from the fir-woods. The vegetation in the, neighbourhood of Lamteng is European and North American; that is to say, it unites the boreal and temperate floras of the east and west hemispheres; presenting also a few features peculiar to Asia. This is a subject of very great importance in physical geography; as a country combining the botanical characters of several others, affords materials for tracing the direction in which genera and species have migrated, the causes that favour their migrations, and the laws that determine the types or forms of one region, which represent those of another. A glance at the map will show that Sikkim is, geographically, peculiarly well situated for investigations of this kind, being centrically placed, whether as regards south-eastern Asia or the Himalayan chain. Again, the Lachen valley at this spot is nearly equi-distant from the tropical forests of the Terai and the sterile mountains of Tibet, for which reason representatives both of the dry central Asiatic and Siberian, and of the humid Malayan floras meet there.|$|R
50|$|Superficially {{the shape}} of the flowers is strikingly phlox-like, hence the {{designation}} 'Night Phlox', for their evening fragrance. The fragrance after dark suggests that in nature the species in question are pollinated by moths, whereas day-pollinated species often have little or no obvious scent. Research is in progress on the ecological and evolutionary relationships between some members of the genus and specialist long-tongued pollinators, particularly <b>night</b> flying hawk <b>moths</b> (Family Sphingidae) and flies in the families Nemestrinidae, Tabanidae, and Bombyliidae. Day-flying hawk moths, such as the genus Macroglossum (Hummingbird Hawk Moths) also seem to be significant pollinators of many species of Zaluzianskya.|$|R
5000|$|The {{machine was}} test flown in Oxford by Charles Cockell and then flown over the {{rainforest}} canopy in Sumatra, Indonesia [...] in 1993 by Cockell {{in an effort}} to catch moths to catalog the diversity of moths in the rainforest as part of a biodiversity study of the Kerinci Seblat National Park. The machine had several modifications for moth catching: 1) Ultraviolet lights under the front of the aircraft for attracting moths during systematic sweeps of the forest, 2) A moth catching device consisting of an inverted funnel with a pleated butterfly net at the end for trapping moths scooped during flight, 3) A forward facing one million candlepower lamp to avoid trees whilst flying during dusk, 4) Two one million candlepower lamps pointing downwards at an angle to estimate height above the forest canopy, using a similar principle to that adopted for night flying during the 617 Squadron Dams raids in World War 2 and developed by Barnes Wallis (for whom the machine was named), 5) Infra-red night vision system for improving visibility during <b>night</b> time <b>moth</b> catching, provided by 617 Squadron and worn by the entomologist pilot.|$|R
6000|$|One <b>night</b> a <b>moth</b> fluttered in and alighted {{on my hand}} as I sat by the fire, causing me to hold {{my breath}} as I gazed on it. Its fore-wings were pale grey, with shadings dark and light written all over in finest {{characters}} with some twilight mystery or legend; but the round under-wings were clear amber-yellow, veined like a leaf with red and purple veins; a thing of such exquisite chaste beauty that {{the sight of it}} gave me a sudden shock of pleasure. Very soon it flew up, circling about, and finally lighted on the palm-leaf thatch directly over the fire. The heat, I thought, would soon drive it from the spot; and, rising, I opened the door, so that it might find its way out again into its own cool, dark, flowery world. And standing by the open door I turned and addressed it: [...] "O night-wanderer of the pale, beautiful wings, go forth, and should you by chance meet her somewhere in the shadowy depths, revisiting her old haunts, be my messenger--" [...] Thus much had I spoken when the frail thing loosened its hold to fall without a flutter, straight and swift, into the white blaze beneath. I sprang forward with a shriek and stood staring into the fire, my whole frame trembling with a sudden terrible emotion. Even thus had Rima fallen--fallen from the great height--into the flames that instantly consumed her beautiful flesh and bright spirit! O cruel Nature! ...|$|R
60|$|The cowslip differs so conspicuously {{in general}} {{appearance}} from the primrose, that nothing need here be said {{with respect to}} their external characters. (2/2. The Reverend W.A. Leighton has pointed out certain differences {{in the form of the}} capsules and seed in 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' 2nd series volume 2 1848 page 164.) But some less obvious differences deserve notice. As both species are heterostyled, their complete fertilisation depends on insects. The cowslip is habitually visited during the day by the larger humble-bees (namely Bombus muscorum and hortorum), and at <b>night</b> by <b>moths,</b> as I have seen in the case of Cucullia. The primrose is never visited (and I speak after many years' observation) by the larger humble-bees, and only rarely by the smaller kinds; hence its fertilisation must depend almost exclusively on moths. There is nothing in the structure of the flowers of the two plants which can determine the visits of such widely different insects. But they emit a different odour, and perhaps their nectar may have a different taste. Both the long-styled and short-styled forms of the primrose, when legitimately and naturally fertilised, yield on an average many more seeds per capsule than the cowslip, namely, in the proportion of 100 to 55. When illegitimately fertilised they are likewise more fertile than the two forms of the cowslip, as shown by the larger proportion of their flowers which set capsules, and by the larger average number of seeds which the capsules contain. The difference also between the number of seeds produced by the long-styled and short-styled flowers of the primrose, when both are illegitimately fertilised, is greater than that between the number produced under similar circumstances by the two forms of the cowslip. The long-styled flowers of the primrose when protected from the access of all insects, except such minute ones as Thrips, yield a considerable number of capsules containing on an average 19.2 seeds per capsule; whereas 18 plants of the long-styled cowslip similarly treated did not yield a single seed.|$|R
6000|$|I have {{examined}} only three homostyled species, namely, L. usitatissimum, angustifolium, and catharticum. I raised 111 plants {{of a variety}} of the first- named species, and these, when protected under a net, all produced plenty of seed. The flowers, according to H. Muller, are frequented by bees and moths. (3/9. 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' etc. page 168.) With respect to L. catharticum, the same author shows that the flowers are so constructed that they can freely fertilise themselves; but if visited by insects they might be cross- fertilised. He has, however, only once seen the flowers thus visited during the day; but it may be suspected that they are frequented during the <b>night</b> by small <b>moths</b> {{for the sake of the}} five minute drops of nectar secreted. Lastly, L. Lewisii is said by Planchon to bear on the same plant flowers with stamens and pistils of the same height, and others with the pistils either longer or shorter than the stamens. This case formerly appeared to me an extraordinary one; but I am now inclined to believe that it is one merely of great variability. (3/10. Planchon in Hooker's 'London Journal of Botany' 1848 volume 7 page 175. See on this subject Asa Gray in 'American Journal of Science' volume 36 September 1863 page 284.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2008 a new [...] "Friends of Kincraig Lake" [...] {{group was}} set up by local {{residents}} to help restore the wetland back to its former glory, following years of tipping, vandalism and neglect. The group's first priority being to repair the footpaths which circumnavigate the entire lake {{at a cost of about}} £10,000, which would improve disabled access to the lake. The group's first meeting was held on 29 January at the local community centre in nearby Stronsay Place. As well making a priority improvements to the footpaths it was also agreed to beging regular [...] "litter picks", and to hold monthly Friends meetings. On 11 February it was revealed that Blackpool Probation Service has offered to send teams to clear out debris at two small ponds in the area, Kilmory Place pond and Dumfries Place pond. Also the priorities for the Friends include new footpaths, signs and repairs to benches with the main priority being to see the footpaths upgraded to improve access to, and around, the lake. On 12 April 2008 the Friends group organised a litter pick which was attended by local MP, Joan Humble and they removed nearly one tonne of litter and fly-tipping from around the lake. As part of the National <b>Moth</b> <b>Night,</b> the Friends organised a moth recording event for 7 June.|$|R
