500|$|Fossett {{grew up in}} Garden Grove, California {{and earned}} the Eagle Scout award in 1957. He {{credited}} his experience in Scouting {{as a foundation for}} much of his later success. [...] "As a Scout, I learned how to set goals and achieve them," [...] he once said. [...] "Being a Scout also taught me leadership at a young age when there are few opportunities to be a leader. Scouting values have remained with me throughout my life, in my business career, and <b>now</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> take on new challenges." [...] In his later years, he was described as a [...] "legend" [...] by fellow Scouts. As a national BSA volunteer, he served as Chairman of the Northern Tier High Adventure Committee, Chairman of the Venturing Committee, member of the Philmont Ranch Committee, and member of the National Advisory Council. He later {{became a member of the}} BSA National Executive Board, and in 2007, Fossett succeeded Secretary of Defense Robert Gates as president of the National Eagle Scout Association. Fossett previously had served on the World Scout Committee.|$|E

2500|$|An often {{overlooked}} literary influence on Kerouac was James Joyce, whose work he alludes {{to more than}} any other author. Kerouac had high esteem for Joyce and he often used [...] Joyce's stream-of-consciousness technique. Regarding On the Road, he {{wrote in a letter to}} Ginsberg, [...] "I can tell you <b>now</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> look back on the flood of language. It is like Ulysses and should be treated with the same gravity." [...] Additionally, Kerouac admired Joyce's experimental use of language, as seen in his novel Visions of Cody, which uses an unconventional narrative as well as a multiplicity of authorial voices.|$|E

And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel. When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went. And their rims were tall and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around. Book of Ezekiel Chapter 1:15-18, Bible, English Standard Version ...|$|E

Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that, from the season three episode of How I Met Your Mother, [...] "Everything Must Go", the taxicab ride scene of regular character Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) and recurring character Abby (Britney Spears) includes a homage to the Sam and Diane's office scene from [...] "Showdown", which includes lines, like [...] "Are you as turned on right <b>now</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am?"

2500|$|At The Amaz!ng Meeting 3 Penn and Teller {{were asked}} about the {{evidence}} for their secondhand smoke episode being faulty. Penn Jillette, with Teller sitting at his side, said [...] "What we talked about during the show was where the stuff was there", meaning that he was using the data {{that the government had}} when they instituted the ban, then said regarding this episode they were [...] "very likely" [...] wrong. Penn went on to describe [...] "a new study that came out of England, just recently, that seems to have more stuff about it" [...] and [...] "right <b>now,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> sit here, there probably is danger in secondhand smoke". He {{went on to say that}} this was a small portion of the program, and their main point was their opposition to [...] "outlawing" [...] smoking in privately owned businesses, which they still [...] "stand behind 100%".|$|E
2500|$|To {{supplement}} his income, {{the young}} Domingo {{played the piano}} for a ballet company, [...] {{as well as for}} a program on Mexico's newly founded cultural television station. The program consisted of excerpts from zarzuelas, operettas, operas, and musical comedies. He acted in a few small parts while at the theater in plays by Federico García Lorca, Luigi Pirandello, and Anton Chekhov. He also provided song arrangements and backup vocals for Los Camisas Negras in the late 1950s, a rock-and-roll band led by César Costa. In his autobiography, Domingo reflected on the benefits of his busy and varied career as a teenager: [...] "Today, when people ask me how I manage to hold up under my extremely heavy work load, I answer that I became accustomed to intense activity very early in my life and that I love it <b>now</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> loved it then." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 190s, the warlord Yuan Shu {{controlled}} the lands around the Huai River in Yang Province. He {{had heard of}} Zhang Cheng's elder brother, Zhang Fan, and wanted to recruit him as an adviser. However, Zhang Fan claimed that he was ill and sent Zhang Cheng to meet Yuan Shu instead. Yuan Shu asked Zhang Cheng, [...] "In the past, when the kings of the Zhou dynasty were weak, warlords such as Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin rose up and became the dominant powers; when the Qin dynasty was collapsing, the Han dynasty rose up and replaced it. <b>Now,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> rule over many territories and its people, I hope to enjoy the same glory as Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin did, and {{follow in the footsteps}} of Emperor Gaozu of Han. What do you think?" [...] Zhang Cheng replied, [...] "It depends on virtue rather than power. If a man can embody everyone's hopes for a benevolent and virtuous ruler, even if he has nothing to his name, it won't be hard for him to achieve what you described. However, if a man doesn't know his place and decides to do something against the people's will, everyone will abandon him instead of helping him." [...] Yuan Shu was displeased by what Zhang Cheng said.|$|E
