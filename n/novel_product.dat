50|$|Underoos were {{developed}} as a product idea in 1977 by an independent entrepreneur, Larry Weiss, who obtained licenses for the four major comic character groups (DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Hanna-Barbera, Archie Comics) which included Superman, Batman, Shazam, Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Spider-Man, and Captain America. The product idea was first offered to Hanes, but was rejected. Scott Paper company pursued development, but ultimately decided to not market the product. Fruit of the Loom had been engaged as supplier of the blank underwear and another vendor engaged to apply transfers. Informed of Scott Paper Company's decision to not market this <b>novel</b> <b>product,</b> Fruit of the Loom inquired {{if they would be}} permitted to market the product, now fully developed. Weiss agreed, and in 1978 Fruit of the Loom bought Underoos. The product was tested in three markets including the New York Metropolitan area. Retailer and consumer demand was so strong, the product was immediately expanded to national distribution.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} wet corn gluten feed and a <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> containing raw soybean hulls and corn steep liquor on performance in lactating dairy cows. Forty-six multiparous Holstein cows were used in a randomized incomplete block design. Cows were housed in tie stalls for the first 13 weeks of lactation and moved to group pens {{for the remainder of}} the study. Cows were blocked by calving date and assigned to control, wet corn gluten feed (20 % of diet DM), or the <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> (20 % of diet DM). Diets were administered as total mixed rations at the first feeding postpartum. Control contained (DM basis) 30 % alfalfa hay, 15 % corn silage, 32 % corn, 9. 3 % whole cottonseed, 4. 4 % solvent soybean meal (SBM), 3. 3 % expeller SBM, 1. 3 % fish meal, 1 % wet molasses, and 3. 7 % vitamins/minerals. Wet corn gluten feed replaced 10 % alfalfa hay, 5 % corn silage, 5 % corn grain, and expeller SBM replaced solvent SBM to maintain diet rumen undegradable protein. The <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> replaced 10 % alfalfa hay, 5 % corn silage, 3 % solvent SBM, and 2 % corn. Diet crude protein % and energy density (Mcal/lb, NEL) for control, wet corn gluen feed, and the <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> were 18. 4, 0. 73; 18. 2, 0. 75; 18. 5, 0. 73; respectively. Milk, energy corrected milk, dry matter intake, and production efficiency (ratio of milk to DM intake) did not differ among diets during the first 91 days of lactation, but there was a diet by week interaction for production efficiency. Cows fed control were more efficient during the first 2 weeks postpartum than cows fed wet corn gluten feed and the <b>novel</b> <b>product,</b> likely due to increased fat mobilization from adipose tissue because intake as a percent of body weight was less for cows fed control. During weeks 3 through 14 postpartum, wet corn gluten feed and the <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> improved milk, energy corrected milk, and milk component yield, and production efficiency. Inclusion of wet corn gluten feed and the <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> at 20 % of dietary DM as a partial replacement for alfalfa hay, corn silage, corn grain, and SBM in diets fed to lactating dairy cattle supported performance during early lactation and improved performance during mid and late lactation. In addition, combining wet corn gluten feed or the <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> with corn silage and alfalfa hay maintained milk fat yields, thereby demonstrating that they can serve as effective sources of fiber when fed at 20 % of dietary DM. Improved performance attributed to wet corn gluten feed and the <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> is due to factors other than improved digestibility of the diets. These results indicate that wet corn gluten feed and the <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> can serve as alternative feedstuffs in diets fed to lactating dairy cattle...|$|E
40|$|Satiety, the {{suppression}} of appetite after food consumption, involves a complex integration of cognitive, sensory and post-ingestive signals generated by the consumed product. A {{better understanding of how}} these different signals interact could allow the development of <b>novel</b> <b>products</b> optimised to produce satiety, thereby helping to counteract the effects of obesogenic lifestyles. This report highlights recent studies, conducted largely as part of the BBSRC DRINC initiative, which examined how beliefs about satiety before food ingestion and the sensory experience during ingestion together influence how the consumer responds to food.

40|$|Four ruminally {{cannulated}} and two intact multiparous Holstein cows {{were used}} in a 3 × 3 replicated Latin square design to evaluate digestibility and rumen traits in lactating dairy cows in response to feeding wet corn gluten feed and a <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> containing raw soybean hulls and corn steep liquor. Three dietary treatments were fed in the experiment. The control contained (DM basis) 30 % alfalfa hay, 15 % corn silage, 32 % corn, 9. 3 % whole cottonseed, 4. 4 % solvent soybean meal (SBM), 3. 3 % expeller SBM, 1. 3 % fish meal, 1 % wet molasses, and 3. 7 % vitamins/ minerals. Wet corn gluten feed replaced 10 % alfalfa hay, 5 % corn silage, 5 % corn grain, and expeller SBM replaced solvent SBM to maintain diet rumen undegradable protein. The <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> replaced 10 % alfalfa hay, 5 % corn silage, 3 % solvent SBM, and 2 % corn. Diets were analyzed to have dietary crude protein percentage and energy density values (Mcal/lb, NEL) of 18. 7, 0. 75; 18. 7, 0. 77; 18. 7, 0. 74; for control, wet corn gluten feed, and the <b>novel</b> <b>product,</b> respectively. Experimental periods were 14 days (10 days adaptation and 4 days collection). Acid insoluble ash was used to estimate fecal output. Dry matter intake averaged 37. 9 lb/day and total tract digestibilities of dry matter (DM), organic matter, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and crude protein did not differ among diets: 71. 7 %, 73. 2 %, 63. 1 %, 58. 5 % and 73. 0 %, respectively. Diets affected liquid dilution rate, ruminal pH, and ruminal concentrations of total volatile fatty acids and ammonia similarly. The molar ratio of acetate to propionate was greater (P< 0. 05) for control (3. 38) than for wet corn gluten feed (2. 79) and the <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> (2. 89). Inclusion of wet corn gluten feed and the <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> at 20 % of dietary DM as a partial replacement for alfalfa hay, corn silage, corn grain, and SBM in diets fed to lactating dairy cattle supported lactational performance similar to the control diet. Additionally, combining wet corn gluten feed or the <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> with corn silage and alfalfa hay maintained milk fat yields and ruminal pH, thereby demonstrating that wet corn gluten feed and the <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> can serve as an effective source of fiber when fed at 20 % of dietary DM.

40|$|An {{optimized}} formulation {{was developed}} for the preparation of an ‘ice-sage tea ’ which might {{be considered to be}} a new healthy functional product and designed as an alternative to other cold-served drinks in the market. A central composite design was used for modeling of the experiment with two independent variables (extraction time and blending ratios of two different sage varieties: Salvia officinalis (SO) and Salvia sclarea (SC)). Flavor profile of this <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> was developed using descriptive sensory analysis techniques; consumer acceptability of the product was also tested. Blending SO with SC was expected to increase the positive health effects of this <b>novel</b> <b>product,</b> while there was a limit for its concentration at increased extraction times. According to the evaluation of experienced panelists, blending common sage SO with SC did not reduce the overall likeability of this <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> at low extraction times. Statistically, just two models for astringency and overall impression were found to be acceptable by taking into con-sideration their regression coefficient and probability values. On the other hand, consumer test results showed that the samples prepared by blending SO with SC up to 25 % might increase the likeability scores of the product when compared to the product without SC.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a critical review}} of the literature on non-market valuation methods to estimate the welfare impact of novel products; it is the first study to assess both observed data- and perception-based methods as non-market valuation methods. Observed databased methods include budgets, regression, mathematical programming, and simulation. Perceptions-based methods include the contingent valuation method, choice-based conjoint analysis and experimental methods. Findings imply that the preferred observed data-based method to estimate the ex ante economic impact of a new technology on the welfare of the farm household is a combination of simulation and mathematical programming. The preferred perceptionbased method for estimating the ex ante impact of a <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> on the welfare of an economic agent is represented by experimental methods. Findings also imply that observed-data based methods and more specifically mathematical programming are more popular for estimating the ex ante farm-level economic impact of a new technology. On the other hand, perception-based methods are more popular for estimating the economic impact of a <b>novel</b> <b>product</b> for consumers.

40|$|The {{environmental}} {{potential of}} producing <b>novel</b> <b>products</b> out of RCT (red cabbage trimmings) {{has been compared}} with using it as fodder to husbandry. Life cycle assessment (LCA) {{has been used to}} make the comparison. It is believed that in the future the volume of by-products from the food chain used as cattle feed will be minimized. The product Red cabbage trimmings was chosen to focus on because of the valuable compounds in the plant, and because of the waste generation in form of RCT that RC (red cabbage) refining means. The <b>novel</b> <b>products</b> that were produced were dietary fiber, phytochemical juice, pectin and MHR (modified hairy regions). Running costs of the process and microbiological activity in the end products were also evaluated in order to assess the realisation of processing RCT into <b>novel</b> <b>products.</b> A system called the RCT system was defined. In this system RCT could be processed into <b>novel</b> <b>products,</b> treated as fodder or composted. These alternatives were later reduced to the production and fodder system, since the compost system proved to be hard to define. The RCT production process system was modeled in higher detail level than the other alternatives (a simulation model in Simulink was made) and was divided in simulation alternatives, based on product mix. The product mixes that were evaluated were: 1. Production of phytochemical juice and dietary fiber. 2. Production of phytochemical juice and pectin. 3. Production of phytochemcial juice, dietary fiber and pectin. In order to compare the two RCT system alternatives two scenarios were designed (the compost excluded). These scenarios were called the process scenario (RCT is processed) and the feed scenario (RCT is treated as fodder). These scenarios were combined with the three alternatives of producing <b>novel</b> <b>products,</b> which resulted in 2 x 3 different combinations of using RCT. System expansion was used when designing the scenarios. No existing alternative production system that was producing MHR was found, which made any product mix including MHR irrelevant. When the process was modeled according to the original specification the process scenario proved to be the worst one seen from an environmental point of view. A number of improvments were then suggested, and if they were implemented the production process scenario proved to be as environmentally potential as the other scenario. To summarize, this work should be looked upon as a framework used for developing and evaluating the scenarios. Especially the RCT process model is a feasible tool for working with and improving the RCT process...|$|R
