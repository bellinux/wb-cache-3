25|$|The Royal Society in a 2011 {{report on}} {{academic}} publishing stated that in share of English scientific research papers the United States was first followed by China, the UK, Germany, Japan, France, and Canada. The report predicted that China would overtake the United States {{some time before}} 2020, possibly as early as 2013.

In 1871, {{at the request of}} officials outraged after Dondrup had done just that with one minister and imprisoned several others, he in turn was ousted and committed suicide after a counter-coup coordinated by the supposedly powerless 'Regent' Khyenrab Wangchuk. As a result of this action this venerable old Regent, who died the <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> <b>is</b> fondly remembered by Tibetans as saviour of the Dalai Lama and the nation.

500|$|In Our Time {{was ignored}} and {{forgotten}} by literary critics for decades. Benson attributes the neglect to various factors. The Sun Also Rises, published the <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> <b>is</b> considered {{the more important}} book followed fairly rapidly by the popular A Farewell to Arms two years after in 1928; critics' general assumption {{seemed to be that}} Hemingway's talent lay in writing prose rather than [...] "sophisticated, complex design"; and In Our Time stories were combined with subsequent collections in the publication of The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories in 1938, drawing the critics' attention away from the book as an entity, toward the individual stories. In 1962, when Scribner's released the paperback edition of In Our Time, it began to be taught in American universities, {{and by the end of}} the decade, the first critical study of the collection appeared. Benson describes the collection as the author's first [...] "major achievement"; Wagner-Martin as [...] "his most striking work, both in terms of personal involvement and technical innovation." ...|$|E
