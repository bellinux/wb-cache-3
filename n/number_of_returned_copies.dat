Officer and physician in accordance with the amount present in the clinic. Some questionnaires are not returned, but the target is to be achieved sufficient to be ignored. Data processing is done to get a percentage, the average (mean) values and standard deviations. The analysis used is the analysis of the average ranking value and Spearmen correlation analysis. Based on the analysis it can be concluded that the level of satisfaction among patients, staff and physicians were equally satisfied with the service and building health centers that exist today.
