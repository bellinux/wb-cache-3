40|$|The ground boom model (AGriculture DISPersion) or AGDISP calculates the {{deposition}} of agrichemicals {{both in the}} area sprayed and more importantly downwind on neighbouring properties. However modelling the breakup and evaporation of the spray droplet cloud over the first few metres is very difficult. Wind Tunnel Dispersion or WTDISP arose to overcome this difficulty. Measurements of droplet spectra and fluxes were made 2 m downwind of several nozzles in a wind tunnel. WTDISP originated as this source was input into the frame work of the ground boom model AGDISP. AGDISP calculates {{the deposition}} by ensemble averaging the droplet paths {{to the ground and}} uses a statistical distribution of the likely paths about these averages to calculate the deposition on the ground. The paper below also outlines possible ways to improve the technique to model field and wind tunnel measurements, including turbulence scaling effects, the orientation of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>fan</b> to the wind direction and field measurements.

A series of nozzle configurations using a single pair or double pairs of vanes with NACA 0012, NACA 4412, and NACA 7514 airfoil profiles are investigated. The effects of the azimuthal mounting position of the deflector vanes, angle of attack, {{and shape of the}} airfoils are studied. The flow field around the vanes, overall flow turning angle, reduction of turbulent kinetic energy, thrust loss, and blockage caused by the deflector vanes are examined. Recommendations regarding the choice of airfoil and mounting configurations are made for best noise suppressing effectiveness with minimum loss of thrust and mass flow.

The cost function used in the optimization includes entropy generation and a penalty for deviating from a target deflection angle. The initial vane airfoil is the NACA 0012. The vane airfoil arising from the optimization produces flat distributions of pressure coefficient over the surface of the vane thus preventing the formation of sonic bubble and strong shocks. For a fixed flow deflection angle, the optimal airfoil is up to 22. 5 % more efficient in terms of specific thrust loss compared to the NACA 0012.

40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center {{recently}} completed an experimental study {{to reduce the}} jet noise from modern turbofan engines. The study concentrated on exhaust nozzle designs for high-bypass-ratio engines. These designs modified the core and <b>fan</b> <b>nozzles</b> individually and simultaneously. Several designs provided an ideal jet noise reduction of over 2. 5 EPNdB for the effective perceived noise level (EPNL) metric. Noise data, after correcting for takeoff thrust losses, indicated over a 2. 0 -EPNdB reduction for nine designs. Individually modifying the <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle</b> did not provide attractive EPNL reductions. Designs in which only the core nozzle was modified provided greater EPNL reductions.

The Swedish Farmers Selling & Purchasing Association had requested its local branches to collect nozzles from farmers who had kept records of how they had been used. These records gave information {{on the type of}} herbicide, the number of seasons used and the spray rate. Altogether 42 sets of nozzles were used in the survey. Of these, 9 were made of brass (<b>fan</b> <b>nozzles)</b> and 33 of plastic (5 cone <b>nozzles,</b> 28 <b>fan</b> <b>nozzles).</b> The experimental equipment consisted of a patternator. The test was divided into two parts, the first dealing with determinations of the flow and the second dealing with the spraying uniformity. In the present study the total flow per nozzle was chosen as a measure of the nozzles range of use. As the original flows of the nozzles are not known, it is impossible to calculate the relative change in flow. This survey demonstrates that the change in flow is negligible within the sector in which the nozzles have been used. Neither do coefficients of variation for the flow change with the total flow. The coefficient of variation for the distribution increases with the total flow in the <b>nozzle.</b> A plastic <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle</b> is, on average, worn out after approximately 4000 l.

In this context, this thesis contributes towards clarifying the following gray aspects of future civil engine development: the connection between an aircraft application, the engine thermodynamic cycle and the advanced technologies of variable area <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle</b> and <b>fan</b> drive gearbox. the connection between the engine thermodynamic cycle and the fuel consumption penalties of extracting bleed or power in order to satisfy the aircraft needs. the scaling of propeller maps in order to enable extensive open-rotor studies similar to the ones carried out for turbofan engines. The rst two objectives are tackled by implementing a preliminary design framework, which comprises models that calculate the engine uninstalled performance, dimensions, weight, drag and installed performance. The framework produces designs that are in good agreement with current and near future civil engines. The need for a variable area <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle</b> is related to the fan surge margin at take-o, while the transition to a geared architecture is identi ed by tracking the variation of the low pressure turbine number of stages.

The prototype of the variable-area <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle</b> implements an overlapping spring leaf assembly to simplify the initial design and to provide ease of structural control. A single bundle of shape memory alloy wire actuators is used to reduce the nozzle geometry. The nozzle is subsequently held in the reduced-area configuration by using magnetorheological fluid brakes.

Cooling towers are used in many process applications in the various industries. Reliability of these towers is crucial. In many cases, redundant towers are installed to ensure a process will not have to be stopped due to a cooling tower failure. The most prevalent cause of cooling tower downtime is failure of bearings, improper water distribution by the <b>nozzles,</b> <b>fan</b> unbalance, failure of the gearbox or associated mechanical components, such as the driveshaft or disc couplings etc. Further, the elimination of these components reduces the losses in the drive system and offers the possibility for improved overall system efficiency. To succeed in the ever-growing competitive global marketplace, it is vital for modem industries to reduce costs related to asset maintenance, repair and replacement, which directly affects the cost of manufactured products. Unplanned downtime results in high maintenance costs. Consequently, improving maintenance efficiency provides substantial benefits to equipments. Cooling tower maintenance considering future uncertainties could improve the efficiencies of the heat transfer processes and as a result, improve the performance of the cooling tower.

Discrepancies with experimental data and the potential for further improvement of this approach are discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of properties of product contact surfaces on cleanability is widely {{discussed in the}} food processing and pharmaceutical industry. In the present work stainless steel surfaces of different surface roughness, surface energy and electrokinetic properties were subject to organic soiling in order to study the {{influence of}} surface properties on cleanability. As food model test soils gelatinized starch and whey protein were chosen. The cleaning was realized by means of water jets from a flat <b>fan</b> <b>nozzle...</b>|$|R
