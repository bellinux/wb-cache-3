In particular, {{this study examines}} how Taiwan's stock market interprets the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> corporate <b>income</b> tax after the 1998 Tax Reform, which switches from the "classical" tax system to the "integrated" tax system. This Tax Reform changes the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> corporate <b>income</b> tax from a pure operating expense to an individual shareholder's tax credit, but current GAAP still treats it as an operating expense in the income statement.

5000|$|A {{statement}} by 28 leading Australians, including Professor of Anthropology Jon Altman, Hon Ian Viner, and Hon Malcolm Fraser criticised the policy {{since there is}} no apparent attempt to involve Aboriginal people or Elders and discussed how the policy lacked informed consent on part of the affected communities.

[...] The individuals asserted that the policy violates the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and breaches the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The individuals called on the Government to abandon the legislation and set up appropriate mechanisms to involve Aboriginals leaders and Elders of the Northern Territory in the decision-making processes that define their future.

50|$|At common law, {{there was}} no {{apportionment}} of rent in respect of time. Such apportionment was, however, in certain cases allowed in England by the Distress for Rent Act 1737, and the Apportionment Act 1834, and is now allowed generally. Under that statute (§2) all rents, annuities, dividends and other periodical payments in the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> are to be considered as accruing {{from day to day}} and to be apportionable in respect of time accordingly. It is provided, however, that the apportioned part of such rents, etc., shall only be payable or recoverable {{in the case of a}} continuing payment, when the entire portion of which it forms part itself becomes payable, and, in the case of a payment determined by re-entry, death or otherwise, only when the next entire portion would have been payable if it had not so determined (§ 3). Persons entitled to apportioned parts of rent have the same remedies for recovering them when payable as they would have had in respect of the entire rent; but a lessee is not to be liable for any apportioned part specifically. The rent is recoverable by the heir or other person who would, but for the apportionment, be entitled to the entire rent, and he holds it subject to distribution (§ 4). The Apportionment Act 1870 extends to payments not made under any instrument in writing (§2), but not to annual sums made payable in policies of insurance (§ 6). Apportionment under the act can be excluded by express stipulation.|$|E

By conceptualizing a person 9 ̆ 2 s comparison income as the income predicted by an earnings equation, we find that, while in 1990 - 1999 envy has been the dominant concern in West Germany and signaling the dominant factor in East Germany, income comparison was non-existing in 2000 - 2009. We also find that the earnings equation reflects people 9 ̆ 2 s ability more accurately in the second than in the first period. Together, these findings suggest that comparing one 9 ̆ 2 s income with people of the same ability is important only when ability is insufficiently reflected in own income...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> labor <b>income</b> risk by {{exploiting}} {{the information contained in}} the joint dynamics of households’ labor earnings and consumption-choice decisions. In particular, this paper attempts to discriminate between two leading views on the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> labor <b>income</b> risk: the “restricted income profiles” (RIP) model — in which individuals are subjected to large and persistent income shocks but face similar life-cycle income profiles — and the “heterogeneous income profiles” (HIP) model — in which individuals are subjected to income shocks with modest persistence but face individual-specific income profiles. Although these two diferent income processes have vastly di¤erent implications for economic behavior, earlier studies have found that labor income data alone is insufficient to distinguish between them. This paper, therefore, brings to bear the information embedded in consumption data. Specifically, we apply the powerful new tools of indirect inference to rich panel data on consumption and labor earnings to estimate a rich structural consumption-savings model. The method we develop is very flexible and allows the estimation <b>of</b> <b>income</b> processes from economic decisions in the presence of nonseparabilities between consumption and leisure, partial insurance <b>of</b> <b>income</b> shocks, frequentl...|$|R
