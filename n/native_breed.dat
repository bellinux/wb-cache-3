40|$|Today’s {{community}} {{requires an}} increase in food production. Animals are today bred so that they produce more than their ancestors did. Production {{has been the most}} important and breeds with the highest production levels have therefore become popular.

To save the breeds that are left the Swedish board of agriculture has the responsibility to conserve these <b>native</b> <b>breeds.</b> People are working on several different levels, both local and national to preserve the <b>native</b> <b>breeds.</b> The <b>native</b> <b>breeds</b> have recently received attention among politicians.

25|$|During {{the later}} 19th century numbers of Bloodhounds were {{imported}} from Britain by French enthusiasts, who regretted {{the extinction of}} the ancient St Hubert. They wished to re-establish it, using the Bloodhound, which, despite its developments in Britain, they regarded as the St Hubert preserved unchanged. Many of the finest specimens were bought and exhibited and bred in France as Chiens de S. Hubert, especially by Le Couteulx de Canteleu, who himself bred over 300. Whatever few original St Huberts remained either died out or were absorbed into the new population. As a result, the Bloodhound became known on parts of the Continent as the Chien de Saint-Hubert. In the mid 20th century the Brussels-based FCI accepted the claim of Belgium to be the country of origin. There are now annual celebrations {{in the town of}} Saint-Hubert, in which handlers in period dress parade their hounds.

60|$|The French {{have little}} to boast of {{in the way of}} horseflesh. Most of the fine coach and {{cabriolet}} cattle of Paris come from Mecklenburgh, though some are imported from England. It is not common to meet with a very fine animal of the <b>native</b> <b>breed.</b> In America, land is so plenty and so cheap, that we keep a much larger proportion of brute force than is kept here. It is not uncommon with us to meet with those who live by day's work, using either oxen or horses. The consequence is that many beasts are raised with little care, and with scarcely any attention to the breeds. We find many good ones. In spite of bad grooming, little training, and hard work, I greatly question if even England possesses a larger proportion of good horses, comparing the population of the two countries, than America. Our animals are quicker footed, and at trotting, I suspect, we could beat the world; Christendom, certainly. The great avenue between the garden of the Tuileries and the Bois de Boulogne, with the allées of the latter, are the places to meet the fast-goers of the French capital, and I am strongly of opinion {{that there is no such}} exhibition of speed, in either, as one meets on the Third Avenue of New York. As for the Avenue de Neuilly, our sulky riders would vanish like the wind from anything I have seen on it; although one meets there, occasionally, fine animals from all parts of Europe.|$|E

6000|$|With {{racehorses}} {{selection for}} swiftness has been followed methodically, and our horses now easily surpass their progenitors. The increased size and different {{appearance of the}} English racehorse led a good observer in India to ask," [...] Could any one in this year of 1856, looking at our racehorses, conceive {{that they were the}} result of the union of the Arab horse and the African mare?" [...] (20/72. 'The India Sporting Review' volume 2 page 181; 'The Stud Farm' by Cecil page 58.) This change has, it is probable, been largely effected through unconscious selection, that is, by the general wish to breed as fine horses as possible in each generation, combined with training and high feeding, but without any intention to give to them their present appearance. According to Youatt (20/73. 'The Horse' page 22.), the introduction in Oliver Cromwell's time of three celebrated Eastern stallions speedily affected the English breed; [...] "so that Lord Harleigh, one of the old school, complained that the great horse was fast disappearing." [...] This is an excellent proof how carefully selection must have been attended to; for without such care, all traces of so small an infusion of Eastern blood would soon have been absorbed and lost. Notwithstanding that the climate of England has never been esteemed particularly favourable to the horse, yet long-continued selection, both methodical and unconscious, together with that practised by the Arabs during a still longer and earlier period, has ended in giving us the best breed of horses in the world. Macaulay (20/74. 'History of England' volume 1 page 316.) remarks, [...] "Two men whose authority on such subjects was held in great esteem, the Duke of Newcastle and Sir John Fenwick, pronounced that the meanest hack ever imported from Tangier would produce a finer progeny than could be expected from the best sire of our <b>native</b> <b>breed.</b> They would not readily have believed that a time would come when the princes and nobles of neighbouring lands would be as eager to obtain horses from England as ever the English had been to obtain horses from Barbary." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have often}} been struck with {{the superiority of the}} pampa or creolla--the old <b>native</b> <b>breed</b> of sheep--in the greater vigour of the young when born over the {{improved}} European varieties. The pampa descends to us from the first sheep introduced into La Plata about three centuries ago, and is a tall, gaunt bony animal, with lean dry flesh, like venison, and long straight wool, like goats' hair. In their struggle for existence in a country subject to sudden great changes of temperature, to drought, and failure of grass, they have in a great measure lost the qualities which make the sheep valuable to man as a food and wool-producing animal; {{but on the other hand}} they have to some extent recovered the vigour of a wild animal, being hardy enough to exist without any shelter, and requiring from their master man only protection from the larger carnivores. They are keen-scented, swift of foot and Wonderfully active, and thrive where other breeds would quickly starve. I have often seen a lamb dropped on the frosty ground in bitterly cold windy weather in midwinter, and in less than five seconds struggle to its feet, and seem as vigorous as any day-old lamb of other breeds. The dam, impatient at the short delay, and not waiting to give it suck, has then started off at a brisk trot after the flock, scattered and galloping before the wind like huanacos rather than sheep, with the lamb, scarcely a minute in the world, running freely at her side. Notwithstanding its great vigour it has been proved that the pampa sheep has not so far outgrown the domestic taint as to be able to maintain its own existence when left entirely to itself. During the first half of this century, when cattle-breeding began to be profitable, and wool was not worth the trouble of shearing, and the gaucho workman would not eat mutton when beef was to be had, some of the estancieros on the southern pampas determined to get rid of their sheep, which were of no value to them; and many flocks were driven a distance out and lost in the wilds. Out of many thousands thus turned loose to shift for themselves, not one pair survived to propagate a new race of feral sheep; in a short time pumas, wild dogs, and other beasts of prey, had destroyed them all. The sterling qualities of the pampa sheep had their value in other times; at present the improved kinds are alone considered worth having, and the original sheep of the country is now rapidly disappearing, though still found in remote and poor districts, especially in the province of Cordova; and probably before long it will become extinct, together with the curious pug-nosed cow of the pampas.|$|E

The authors are aware of the limited range of the presented material but a serious drawback has been the lack of information available from Albania, Bulgaria, Byelarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova and former Yugoslavia.
