40|$|The occurrence, frequency, {{distribution}} and determinants of HIV and AIDS are described for Maltese residents. Up to 30 June 1996, 38 notifications of AIDS were {{received by the}} Public Health Department (36 in males), 35 died. The overall mean survival between <b>notification</b> <b>date</b> and death was calculated using data for 28 reported cases as 216. 71 days. Mean age at notification was 30. 5 years (range: 2 to 48; median 31). Occurrence in males was highest for homosexuals/bisexuals (52. 8 %), followed by recipients of contaminated blood products (30. 6 %) and heterosexual contact (5. 6 %). The two females acquired HIV through mother-to-child transmission (abroad) and heterosexual intercourse respectively. Mode of transmission was unrecognised in 7. 9 % of cases. Epidemiological data on AIDS cases usually reflects the situation of HIV transmission some twelve to fifteen years previously. Sero-surveillance studies are now indicated to clarify the actual prevalence of HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|A {{seasonal}} rise in tuberculosis (TB) notifications {{has been}} confirmed in several studies. Here, we examined one hypothesis for its cause: increased transmission of TB during wintertime due to crowding. Seasonality analysis was performed on actual and simulated notifications of clustered TB cases, which {{are considered to be}} representative of recent transmission, diagnosed from 1993 to 2004 in the Netherlands (n = 4, 746). To test the hypothesis of winter crowding, notifications were simulated by adding patient delay and incubation period to an infection date randomly taken to be in winter in 80 % of cases. The incubation periods were derived from frequency distributions for different TB disease localizations drawn from the literature. Seasonality analysis was performed using autocorrelation function plots and spectral analysis. Actual notifications showed strong seasonality in clustered TB and clustered extrapulmonary TB cases but not in clustered pulmonary TB cases. Analysis of simulated notifications revealed barely significant seasonality only in extrapulmonary TB cases. Our results suggest that increased transmission of TB during wintertime is unlikely to be the only cause of the seasonal peak in TB notifications. A factor closer to the <b>notification</b> <b>date</b> probably contributes to the seasonality observed in TB notifications...|$|E
40|$|While {{carrying}} out the design {{and implementation of the}} automatic program generator Descartes, we have been conducted to develop new means of reasoning on extended first-order expressions. Descartes needs to prove theorems on expressions, depending on their context within the specification it receives as input. We have defined a new weak form of theorem proving, which applies to sets, logical expressions, and real numbers. The method is based on the definition of abstract operators which generalize the set, logical and real operators, in particular a partial order relation, which instanciates as inclusion, logical implication, or the conventional real order relation. For any given interesting expression e, intervals of expressions including e are computed. These intervals can be propagated to subexpressions, making it possible to prove new theorems at the meta-level, and to process simplifications of expressions which depend on their context. Various examples of application of this technique are given throughout the paper. This paper is original and unpublished work. It is substantially different from papers currently under review and will not be submitted elsewhere before the <b>notification</b> <b>date</b> other than to workshops and similar specialized presentations with a very limited audience. ...|$|E

We aimed {{to quantify the}} completeness of reporting (CoR) of pertussis hospitalizations and deaths in the Netherlands. Study design CoR was estimated using capture-recapture analyses. Hospitalizations (2007 – 2014) from the National Registration Hospital Care (hospital data) were matched to the notifiable Infectious Disease case registry (notifications) providing (month and) year of birth, gender and postal code. Deaths (1996 – 2014) from Statistics Netherlands (death registry) were matched to notifications using gender, age, year of death and <b>notification</b> <b>date.</b> Cases < 2 years (y) and ≥ 2 y were analysed separately. Chao’s estimator estimated the total population, which was used to calculate CoR. Results Using strict matching criteria, we found 461 matches among 876 (hospital data) and 757 (notifications) hospitalizations < 2 y. The population estimate of hospitalized infants was 1446, resulting in CoR between 52 % and 61 %. For hospitalizations ≥ 2 y (246; hospital data and 264; notifications) 43 matches were found, with a population estimate of 1512 and CoR between 16. 5 % and 22 %. Among thirteen (death registry) and eight (notifications) deaths < 2 y, seven cases overlapped. The population estimate was 16. CoR of the two sources was 50 – 81 %. With two (death registry) and eight (notifications) deaths ≥ 2 y without overlap, the population estimate was 26 and CoR 8 – 31 %. Conclusion Results showed substantial underestimation of pertussis hospitalizations and deaths. This {{has to be taken}} into account in evaluation of current and future immunization programs...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{counselors are}} health {{professionals}} specially trained in medical genetics and counseling. Twenty-nine master's level genetic counseling training programs exist in North America and collectively admit approximately 195 students each year. Continuation {{of the education}} and training of these specialized health professionals has significant public health importance. The existing admissions process has recently proven to be labor intensive and time consuming, with difficulty encountered while trying to fill programs. As {{a result of these}} obstacles, an alternative admissions procedure was explored. The match algorithm used by U. S. medical residency programs was used as a basis for this study. Under this system, software utilizes rank order lists submitted by programs and applicants to place the two parties into the most mutually beneficial program-applicant pairings. Twenty-seven genetic counseling programs and 166 current first year students participated in a survey that gathered program and student preferences. In addition, interest, opinions, and suggestions concerning the existing and proposed admissions system were ascertained. Due to incomplete student participation in the study, the U. S. residency match algorithm was modified. Compared with the existing admissions process, the match resulted in more programs (4 of 27) with unfilled slots, and approximately equal student satisfaction in terms of which program they were matched to. The accuracy of the modified match results is limited due to the match modifications and insufficient number of study participants. The majority of students (66 %) indicated they would not be willing to participate in a match and 75 % indicated they were satisfied or very satisfied with the existing admissions process. Program directors were largely satisfied with the existing process (81 %). Benefits of a match may include: time efficiency, reduction in anxiety, and ease of process. Both students and program directors perceived barriers to the implementation of a match, including the problem of financial aid distribution under a match, the operating costs, and loss of decision making ability. Both groups suggested improvements for the existing admissions process. Suggestions included introduction of a universal application and an earlier <b>notification</b> <b>date</b> for admissions decisions. This study serves as a collection of data to be used for further investigation into the use of a matching algorithm in genetic counseling admissions...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{of service to}} realize {{residual}} useful life assessment. Everything in the world deteriorates over time. To know the residual useful life {{of a piece of}} equipment contributes to optimal decision-making on its usage time and discards. The rewarding also lies in reduced maintenance cost. For the application of industry process, a novel approach is proposed to define the term residual useful life, making efforts to satisfy diverse criterion on evaluation of equipment usefulness. In current research findings the definition of residual useful life varies. For maintenance purposes, residual useful life is explained by using diagnostics and prognostics, which are critical elements in condition based maintenance. In the domain of reliability, residual useful life is interpreted with probability theory, where mean residual life and conditional survival probability are frequently utilized. Rotating equipment is concentrated in which state-of-the-art models and methods for residual useful life assessment are investigated in this thesis. Residual useful life assessment techniques are dependent on deterministic, probabilistic and combined models in representing deterioration behaviors on various types of equipment. Apart from statistical theory, vibration signals, lubrication oil condition and acoustic noise signals are principal elements for the assessment. A stereotyped residual useful life assessment procedure consists of two interdependent stages, off-line deterioration model learning and on-line prognostic model training. In the best of circumstances, the sufficient raw data for the assessment are acquired through run-to-failure tests. The targeted systems for case study are AC generators and gas turbines served for oil and gas production in Kristin field. Statistical techniques are employed to process and analyze notification data of generators. The regression analysis shows an unimportant relationship between <b>notification</b> <b>date</b> and failure impact. Statistical trend tests do not verify the existence of any monotonic rate of occurrence of failures on AC generators. Vibration data analysis of the gas turbine does not provide monotonic information where residual useful life assessment models could be applied for. The notifications are not demonstrating a systematic pattern. Failures of AC generators and gas turbines are tend to be random. Challenges and recommendations are pointed out for Statoil to execute residual useful life assessment based on current situations. Lubrication oil condition monitoring is strongly recommended in this aspect. Procedures to realize maintenance optimization are demonstrated as a theoretical case study. Markov state model with inspection and block replacement policy are employed to construct cost models on maintenance optimization. With assumed cost elements, an optimal maintenance program is proposed. The analytic process is practically valuable to verify whether the regular inspection is the optimum maintenance strategy. </p...|$|E
