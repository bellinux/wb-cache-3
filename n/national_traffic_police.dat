50|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Police</b> (Liikkuva poliisi, Rörliga polisen) was {{folded into}} the local police in 2013, thus local police is also {{responsible}} for highway patrol. Originally, local police districts were very small and had limited resources, so a separate mobile police organization was founded for riot control, alcohol law enforcement and reserve force duties. Political reliability and independence from local strongmen was also important because of the threat from fascists; indeed, the first task was to escort former president K.J. Ståhlberg {{back to his home}} after he was kidnapped by the Lapua Movement. The organized later evolved into a highway patrol. However, because of mergers, local police departments had become larger. Thus, the separate national organization was deemed redundant and traffic police units were subordinated to the local police departments instead, without change in the actual number of highway patrol officers.|$|E

The relatively large sights of the Egyptian Contract version were replaced - even on the Maadi-made Helwan 951 - by the original smaller, unobtrusive sights which {{were less likely to}} snag on a holster. Serial production of this definitive version initiated in Italy 1955, and in Egypt in the early 1960s. The M1951 is no longer produced in Italy and was never adopted by the Italian Army. The Italian Army instead opted to keep the [...]380 ACP Beretta M1934 in service until the adoption of the 9×19mm Beretta 92; the M1951 was instead adopted by the Italian Navy, the Carabinieri and the Italian <b>national</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Police,</b> but has since been replaced in all services with the above-mentioned Beretta 92, in 1977. Other military forces to have adopted the M1951 include Egypt (where it has been produced by the local firm Maadi as the [...] "Helwan"), Israel, Iraq (license-built as the [...] "Tariq"), Nigeria, Libya and Tunisia; in most of these countries, the pistol is now out of service.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to present results, which those dealing with traffic safety work can use and apply to combat drunk driving. Roadside surveys {{have been carried out}} in {{southern}} Finland since 1979. During 1990 - 2008 altogether 542 495 drivers were tested. 1241 drunk drivers were caught (blood alcohol concentration, BAC = 0. 50) and 3087 drivers had drunk alcohol, but the limit was not exceeded. The commitment of the <b>National</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Police</b> to professional work made it possible to achieve reliableresults. The prevalence of drunk driving has been 0. 2 % with only random variations. The prevalence for drivers below the limit began to climb in the early 2000 s and peaked at 1. 11 % in 2005. The peak was mainly caused by drivers below 0. 2. Men had five times higher risk of driving drunk than women. Risk factors for recidivism were an earlier drunk driving offense, BAC= 1. 20 at the first time of conviction and high levels of alcohol biomarkers. In substance abuse assessment in health care, attention should be paid more effectively to a person s overall life situation. The results strongly support the introduction of obligatory alcolocks at least for recidivists and aggravated drunk drivers...|$|E

The study was based on various theories including system, accident causation, risk homeostasis and goals freedom alertness theories. The study aimed at outlining the roles of <b>Traffic</b> <b>Police</b> in preventing road accidents in Tanzania; assessing the adequacy of <b>Traffic</b> <b>Police</b> equipment; and identifying the challenges facing them in executing their duties. This study used questionnaire as the main method of data collection and the sample size was 226 <b>Traffic</b> <b>Police</b> based in Dar es Salaam. The data was analysed descriptively using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). The study found that <b>Traffic</b> <b>Police</b> were ineffective in preventing road accidents as they failed to create public awareness on road safety issues as well as conducting daily roadside inspections which made road users to relax and possibly cause road accidents. Furthermore, the study found that there was a shortage of road safety traffic equipment like cameras, road direction facilities as well as Traffic patrol vehicles that could assist <b>Traffic</b> <b>Police</b> in preventing road accidents. Moreover, the study found that <b>Traffic</b> <b>Police</b> had a lot of challenges including poor working conditions and inadequate salary package. The study recommends that in order for <b>Traffic</b> <b>Police</b> to be effective in preventing road accidents in Tanzania more efforts should be devoted to creating public awareness on road safety issues; proper training for <b>Traffic</b> <b>Police</b> and adequate road traffic facilities should be put in place.

40|$|In {{accord with}} the UN Global Decade of Action 2011 - 2020, Indonesia is {{committed}} to reducing its traffic fatalities by 50 percent {{by the end of}} 2020. Traffic accidents in 2010 were officially estimated to result in an annual social cost of about 3. 1 percent of the Indonesian Gross Domestic Product (GDP), rising to 3. 7 percent of GDP in 2011. With rapid motorisation associated with economic development, annual social costs could approach some AUD 39 Billion or 4. 6 % of GDP. The Indonesian <b>National</b> <b>Traffic</b> <b>Police</b> Corps role is specified in law relating to road traffic and transportation and includes responsibilities for: roadpolicing, traffic management and traffic enforcement; accident investigation; accident reporting and analysis; driver licensing; vehicle registration; and traffic education. Law 22 / 2009 provides the legislative framework for road safety activities, but the direction is provided by the National General Plan for Traffic and Road Transportation Safety which was released in 2011. The plan identifies five pillars on which to build road safety and traffic enforcement policies and actions: road safety management; safer roads; safer vehicles; safer road users; and, post crash care. To ensure that reliable and valid accident data are available, the police have with World Bank funding developed a web-based accident investigation system (AIS). After piloting in Central Java during 2012, the AIS is available nationwide. Access to comprehensive, reliable and accurate road accident data makes it possible to identify the specific roads, vehicles and road users which need to be targeted with road safety and traffic enforcement interventions. Not only is the IRSMS being used as an accident investigation and policing tool, the system is able to be used by road safety stakeholders. The ability to access up-to-date accident data coupled with the need for Local, Provincial and National road safety interventions, the IRSMS will aid decision makers to develop evidence based strategies to reduce casualties and improve road safety in Indonesia. 11 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} if occupational exposure to chemical, physical and psycho-social urban stressor could cause alterations in plasma free testosterone (T) levels and related diseases in female <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> vs. control group. Patients and methods: The research was carried out on initial sample of 468 female Municipal <b>Police</b> employees (209 <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> and 259 controls). After excluding the principal confounding factors, <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> were matched with controls by age, working life, menstrual cycle day, BMI, drinking habit, cigarette smoking habit, liquorice and soy intake in diet, habitual consumption of Italian coffee. There were 96 female <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> and 96 controls included in the study. Results: T mean levels were significantly higher in female <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> compared to controls (p = 0. 000). The distribution of T values in <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> and in controls was significant (p = 0. 000). No significant differences were found comparing the percentage in <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> and controls concerning dystocial, premature and post-term birth. An increase in mental health disorders was found in <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> compared to controls but the difference was not significant. Conclusion: The increase in T plasma levels observed in <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> vs. controls can be due to a chronic working exposure to low doses of environmental chemical urban stressor. According to our previous researches T could be used as an early biological marker even before the onset of the related disorders. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Studies in the literature have shown that immune parameters could be affected by chronic exposure to various chemical pollutants. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate whether occupational exposure to urban pollutants can cause alterations in NK, IL- 2, IFN-gamma and C 3 plasma levels in female <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> compared to a control group. After excluding subjects with the principal confounding factors, 86 female <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> and 87 controls were matched by age, years of police work and habitual alcohol consumption. The distribution of NK values in female <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> and controls was significantly different (p= 0. 000); NK values above the upper limit of the normal laboratory range were observed in 23 female <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> and in 2 controls (p= 0. 000). IL- 2 mean levels were higher in <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> compared to controls, but the difference was not significant. The mean and the distribution of IFN-gamma values in female <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> and controls were not different. C 3 mean levels were higher in female <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> versus controls, but the difference was not significant. Considering that the subjects with the principal confounding factors were excluded from the study and that female <b>traffic</b> <b>police</b> and controls were matched by the above-mentioned variables, our results suggest that chronic occupational exposure to low doses of chemical stressors, which may interact with and add to psychosocial ones, can affect both innate and adaptative immunity.
