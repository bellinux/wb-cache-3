50|$|The Dubrovnik area {{is again}} a special case. Dubrovnik and its {{surrounds}} are an exclave, {{divided by the}} small <b>Neum</b> <b>corridor</b> belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Historically, the Dubrovnik region has been developed through sea travel. There {{has never been a}} direct rail link through Croatia to Dubrovnik, and none is planned in the future.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Neum</b> <b>corridor</b> {{dates back}} to the Treaty of Sremski Karlovci of 1699, whereby the Republic of Ragusa was {{separated}} from the Dalmatian possessions of its rival Venice by two buffer strips ceded by Venice to the Ottoman empire: north of its territory Neum and the bay of Klek, and south of its territory Sutorina with the port of Herceg-Novi on the Bay of Kotor, now part of Montenegro since 1947.|$|E
5000|$|The Pelješac Bridge (Pelješki most) is {{the name}} of a planned bridge in Croatia the {{construction}} of which had started in 2007. A contentious political issue, the construction was halted in 2012, but is currently still considered prospective. The bridge is intended to connect the Croatian peninsula of Pelješac, and through it the southernmost part of Croatia including Dubrovnik, with the Croatian mainland, while avoiding crossing Bosnia and Herzegovina at the <b>Neum</b> <b>Corridor.</b> It would span the part of the Adriatic Sea which separates the two near the Bay of Mali Ston and the Neretva Channel.|$|E
