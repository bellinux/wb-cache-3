40|$|Pervasive environments are {{characterized}} by rich and dynamic context, where users need to be continuously informed about services relevant to their current context. Implicit discovery requests, triggered by changes of user context, available services, or user preferences are prevalent in such environments. This paper proposes a proactive service discovery approach for pervasive environments to address these implicit requests. Services and user preferences are described by a formal context model, which effectively captures the dynamics of context {{and the relationship between}} services and users. Based on the model, we propose a proactive discovery algorithm to continuously present the most relevant services to the user in response to changes of context, services or user preferences. <b>Numeric</b> <b>coding</b> methods are applied in different phases of the algorithm to improve its performance. A proactive service discovery system is proposed and the context model is grounded in a smart home environment. Experimental results show that our approach can efficiently provide the user with up-to-date information about useful services...|$|E
40|$|The Internet {{offers an}} {{unprecedented}} opportunity to construct powerful large-scale medical expert systems (MES). In these systems, a cost-effective medical knowledge acquisition (KA) and management scheme is highly desirable {{to handle the}} large quantities of, often conflicting, medical information collected from medical experts in different medical fields and from different geographical regions. In this paper, we demonstrate that a medical KA/management system can be built upon a three-tier distributed client/server architecture. The knowledge in the system is stored/managed in three knowledge bases. The maturity of the medical know-how controls the knowledge flow through these knowledge bases. In addition, to facilitate the knowledge representation and application in these knowledge bases {{as well as information}} retrieval across the Internet, an 8 -digit <b>numeric</b> <b>coding</b> scheme with a weight value system is proposed. At present, a medical KA and management system based on the proposed method is being tested in clinics. Current results have showed that the method is a viable solution to construct, modify, and expand a distributed MES through the Internet...|$|E

40|$|Three {{experimental}} paradigms {{were used}} to investigate the perception of orientation relative to internal categorical standards of vertical and horizontal. In Experiment 1, magnitude estimation of orientation (in degrees) relative to vertical and horizontal replicated a previously reported spatial orientation bias also measured using verbal report: Orientations appear farther from horizontal than they are, whether numeric judgments are made relative to vertical or to horizontal. Analyses of verbal response patterns, however, suggested that verbal reports underestimate the true spatial bias. A non-verbal orientation bisection task (Experiment 2) confirmed that spatial errors are not due to <b>numeric</b> <b>coding</b> and are larger than the 6 ° error replicated using verbal methods. A spatial error of 8. 6 ° {{was found in the}} bisection task, such that an orientation of about 36. 4 ° from horizontal appears equidistant from vertical and horizontal. Finally, using a categorization (“ABX”) paradigm in Experiment 3, it was found that there is less memory confusability for orientations near horizontal than for orientations near vertical. Thus, three different types of measures, two of them non-verbal, provide converging evidence that the coding of orientation relative to the internal standards of horizontal and vertical is asymmetrically biased and that horizontal appears to be the privileged axis...|$|E
40|$|Impressions are {{important}} sources of cross contamination between patients and dental laboratories. As {{a part of}} infection control impressions contaminated with variety of micro-organisms via blood and oral secretions should be cleaned and disinfected or sterilized before being handled in dental laboratory. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of autoclaving on dimensional stability of elastomeric impression material (polyvinyl siloxane—Affinis). In this in vitro study standardized stainless steel die as per ADA specification number 19 was fabricated. Polyvinyl siloxane (Affinis) light body and putty viscosity elastomeric impression materials were used. A total of 40 impressions of the stainless steel die were made and <b>numeric</b> <b>coding</b> system was used to identify the samples. Measurements were made using a measuring microscope. Distance between the cross lines CD and C′D′ reproduced in the impression were measured before autoclaving, immediately after autoclaving and 24  hours after autoclaving and dimensional change was calculated. The data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis. The mean difference in dimensional change between the three groups was not statistically significant (P >  0. 05). However the results revealed that there was higher mean dimensional change immediately after autoclaving when compared to the other 2 time intervals. It is desirable to delay the casting of an autoclavable elastomeric impression material by about 24  hours. Though disinfection of impression is routinely followed autoclaving of impression is an effective method of sterilization...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Automatic {{locomotive}} signaling {{of continuous}} type with a <b>numeric</b> <b>coding</b> (ALSN) has several disadvantages: {{a small number}} of signal indications, low noise stability, high inertia and low functional flexibility. Search for new and more advanced methods of signal processing for automatic locomotive signaling, synthesis of the noise proof digital locomotive receiver are essential. Methodology. The proposed algorithm of detection and identification locomotive signaling codes is based on the definition of mutual correlations of received oscillation and reference signals. For selecting threshold levels of decision element the following criterion has been formulated: the locomotive receiver should maximum set the correct solution for a given probability of dangerous errors. Findings. It has been found that the random nature of the ALSN signal amplitude does not affect the detection algorithm. However, the distribution law and numeric characteristics of signal amplitude affect the probability of errors, and should be considered when selecting a threshold levels According to obtained algorithm of detection and identification ALSN signals the digital locomotive receiver has been synthesized. It contains band pass filter, peak limiter, normalizing amplifier with automatic gain control circuit, analog to digital converter and digital signal processor. Originality. The ALSN system is improved by the way of the transfer of technical means to modern microelectronic element base, more perfect methods of detection and identification codes of locomotive signaling are applied. Practical value. Use of digital technology {{in the construction of the}} locomotive receiver ALSN will expand its functionality, will increase the noise immunity and operation stability of the locomotive signal system in conditions of various destabilizing factors...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the Study: Delirium is a {{widespread}} concern for hospitalized seniors, yet is often unrecognized. A comprehensive and sequential intervention (CSI) aiming to effect change in clinician behavior by improving knowledge about delirium was tested.  Design and Methods: A 2 -day CSI program that consisted of progressive 4 -part didactic series, including evidence-based reviews of delirium recognition, prevention, and management, interspersed with interactive small group sessions and practical case conferences was conceptualized in consultation with a leading expert on delirium. Pretest and posttest instruments were designed to test the attendees on their knowledge and confidence around delirium identification.  Results: An average of 71 people attended each didactic session. Among all responses, 50 pretests and posttests were matched based on <b>numeric</b> <b>coding</b> (6 MD/DOs, 34 RNs, and 10 others). Mean pretest and posttest scores were 7. 9 and 10. 8 points, respectively (maximum: 17), showing a positive change in knowledge scores after the intervention (2. 9 points, p <. 001). Improvement in knowledge scores was higher in the cohort attending 2 or more lectures (3. 8 points, p <. 001) compared with those attending only 1 lecture (1. 3 points, p <. 12). Confidence in identifying patients with delirium increased by 28 % (p <. 001), and self-assessed capacity to correctly administer the Confusion Assessment Method increased by 36 % (p <. 001).  Implications: A novel CSI increased clinician knowledge about delirium identification and management and improved confidence and self-assessed capacity to identify delirium in the hospitalized elderly patients. This strategy, which incorporates multiple reinforcing modes of education, may ultimately {{be more effective in}} influencing clinician behavior when compared with traditional grand rounds...|$|E
