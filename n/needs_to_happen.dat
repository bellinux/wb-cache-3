500|$|Pearl Jam {{went on to}} tour Europe for {{its first}} time in six years. The band played a small secret show at the Astoria in London, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2006, despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after Roskilde. In an {{interview}} {{in advance of the}} band's return to the festival circuit, Gossard commented, [...] "It seems like an era to trust that we're aware enough to get through those bigger shows. We have a heightened awareness of what <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> every night so people are as safe as they can possibly be." [...] Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the Leeds set that the band's decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde {{had nothing to do with}} [...] "guts" [...] but with trust in the audience. On September 19, 2006, at the Torino, Italy show at Palaisozaki, Pearl Jam played Pearl Jam in its entirety in order midway through its set. After Europe, the band headed to Australia and then finished the year with two shows in Hawaii. The official bootlegs on this tour were available only in digital form, in both MP3 and lossless FLAC formats. The band's shows at The Gorge Amphitheatre were released as part of the Live at the Gorge 05/06 box set. A DVD documenting the band's shows in Italy entitled Immagine in Cornice was released in 2007.|$|E
500|$|When [...] "Better than Today" [...] {{became a}} single, reviews {{for the song}} itself were mixed. McAlpine of BBC said [...] "the {{relentless}} swaggering momentum" [...] of the track [...] "gets a little wearing". He continued, [...] "At some point, something ELSE <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> y'see [...] No {{matter how many times}} Kylie's voice swoops up high and skips back down again, no matter how firmly she pushes herself into those demanding choruses; it begins like Tigger and ends like a route march around an aerobics class." [...] He gave the single three out of five stars. Popjustice, while stating the song is [...] "rather enjoyable", added that it is a [...] "no-harm-intended album track" [...] instead of [...] "the big balls-out I'm-bloody-Kylie comeback single". They remarked at a later date, saying that they were [...] "slightly alarmed" [...] when the song became a single. Nima Baniamer of Contact Music described the song as [...] "a fun electro number", but it [...] "sadly doesn't seem to pack a punch enough to stand firm as a lead-out track". Originally in an album review, Levine of Digital Spy called the tune [...] "as uplifting a dance-pop ditty as we're likely to hear all year". In a single review, Levine re-evaluated the song, stating that it is not [...] "the freshest confection you'll sample this party season" [...] but he continued, calling it [...] "sweet, seductive and pretty much impossible not to succumb to over and over again". He gave the single four out of five stars.|$|E

[...] Thus, metanoia constitutes the central thing that <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in preaching. Peter Senge observes that {{what happens in a}} [...] "learning organization" [...] that experiences the [...] "deeper meaning of 'learning'" [...] is [...] "metanoia" [...] which means [...] "a shift of mind."

In a video commentary to the album, Knowles explained {{that in her}} mind , she would have never imagined losing as a possibility, {{and it was the}} best message for her. [...] "I feel like something about the aggression of 'Bow Down' and the attitude of 'Flawless'—the reality is, sometimes you lose.

2500|$|As with {{previous}} sessions, Mike Sapone acted {{as both a}} band member and co-producer, while the band were also involved in the albums production. Discussing Sapone's involvement, Lacey defined Sapone as having [...] "as much at stake with the music as we do; he's as invested in it as we are, sometimes more." [...] Accardi described Sapone as having [...] "an uncanny ability to hear something you’re doing and immediately track it to any song in his library that he stores in his brain. He'll go to it, {{show it to you}} and tell you that that’s what <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Here's the better version of it. This is what you’re trying to do and you don't even realize it." [...] Most of the songs were brought to the studio in acoustic form, sometimes as a complete song and sometimes as just a part or riff. The band would then build upon these ideas, recording everything as they worked. The band members were not limited by their normal roles within Brand New, with much instrument swapping and experimenting taking place in writing individual parts. Lacey later commented that [...] "it was such a collaborative effort with the band. Vin might write a drum part or Brian might write a guitar part or whatever. We're not really keeping tabs of how much everyone has at stake on each song".|$|E
