5|$|A 2016 {{study by}} Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) found that {{availability}} of lithium and other finite {{materials used in}} the battery packs will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> limiting factor for the adoption of electric vehicles. BNEF estimated that battery packs will require less than 1% of the known reserves of lithium, nickel, manganese, and copper through 2030, and 4% of the world’s cobalt. After 2030, the study states that new battery chemistries will probably shift to other source materials, making packs lighter, smaller, and cheaper.|$|E

5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E

5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse {{and told them that}} this would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{was sent}} to the Lovelace Clinic and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to undergo {{extensive}} physical examinations and to submit to a battery of psychological tests. He was nearly disqualified when doctors discovered that he suffered from hay fever, but was permitted to continue when it was determined that his allergies would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> problem due to the absence of ragweed pollen in space. On April 13, 1959, Grissom received official notification that he had been selected as one of the seven Project Mercury astronauts.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, in a {{paper in}} Astrophysics: A Topical Symposium, Gerard Kuiper speculated on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System's evolution, {{but he did not}} think that such a belt still existed today. Kuiper was {{operating}} on the assumption, common in his time, that Pluto was the size of Earth and had therefore scattered these bodies out toward the Oort cloud or out of the Solar System. Were Kuiper's hypothesis correct, there would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Kuiper belt today.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, {{proposals}} {{to abolish the}} five district councils in favour of a unitary authority (covering the existing two-tier county) were rejected following local opposition. West Somerset is the least populous district (except for the two sui generis districts) in England. In September 2016, West Somerset and Taunton Deane councils agreed in principle to merge the districts into one (with one council) subject to consultation. It is planned to achieve this on 1 April 2019 with the first elections to the new council in May 2019. The new district would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> unitary authority, with Somerset County Council still performing its functions.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, it was {{reported}} that a new Terminator film was being developed.

However, Pacificor, the owner of the rights to the Terminator franchise, had not given any official license to Hannover House to develop a new film.|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, the Sounds and Nashville SC, an {{expansion}} soccer {{team of the}} United Soccer League, reached a one-year agreement for Nashville SC to play its inaugural 2018 season at First Tennessee Park. Fan support of the team's games {{is expected to be}} a factor in Nashville's bid for a Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise. If the city was to be awarded an MLS team, First Tennessee Park would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> viable location as the league requires soccer-specific stadiums for new franchises. Instead, the team would play at a new stadium, such as the 30,000-seat facility proposed for the Nashville Fairgrounds. Nashville SC is expected to play its first home game as early as March 2018.|$|E
