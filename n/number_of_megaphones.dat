2500|$|In November 2004 the {{university}} obtained an injunction against a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> individuals and groups, including Broughton and SPEAK, which restricts them from approaching within 50 {{yards of the}} construction site and the homes of those connected with the construction, and from holding protests of greater than 50 people in Oxford without police support. The injunction followed mounting complaints from students, researchers and workers about the hours-long use <b>of</b> sirens and <b>megaphones</b> by SPEAK on an almost daily basis. In 2006, Oxford appealed to the High Court to extend the injunction after [...] "clear threats" [...] were made against {{the university}} by the ALF. The court ordered that the injunction be widened to extend the exclusion zone, ban the use <b>of</b> <b>megaphones</b> and afford greater protection to individuals supplying goods or service to the university. A request by Oxford to further restrict the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> protesters to 12 was denied.|$|R

The device, also known as [...] "The Harrington Vamping Horn", was demonstrated to Charles II in St James' Park.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{carried out}} in the 1960s {{demonstrated}} that an alcoholic extract of the ground root of Aniba megaphylla inhibited, in vitro, growth of cells derived from human carcinoma of the nasopharynx. In 1978, the active components of the extract were isolated using silica gel chromatography, characterized and named as megaphone (C22H30O6, solid), megaphone acetate (C24H32O7, oily liquid) and megaphyllone acetate (C23H28O7, oily liquid). For comparison, megaphone acetate was also produced synthetically by reacting megaphone with acetic anhydride at 50 °C for 6 hours. Stirring an alcoholic solution <b>of</b> <b>megaphone</b> (megaphone acetate), with added palladium catalyst, in hydrogen atmosphere, followed by evaporation of the solvent yields tetrahydromegaphone (tetrahydromegaphone acetate) as an oil. Millimeter-sized crystals <b>of</b> <b>megaphone</b> can be grown from an ether-chloroform solution. They have monoclinic symmetry with space group P21, lattice constants a = 0.8757 nm, b = 1.1942 nm and c = 1.0177 nm and two formula units per unit cell. Megaphone and megaphone acetate molecules are chiral and the reported extraction and synthesis procedures yielded their racemic mixtures. Megaphone acetate was also isolated from the root of Endlicheria dysodantha, another plant of Laurel family, using chromatography of ethanolic solution. It showed inhibitory activity against cells of crown gall tumor and human lung, breast and colon carcinomas.|$|R

5000|$|A megaphone, speaking-trumpet, bullhorn, or {{loud hailer}} is a portable, usually hand-held, {{cone-shaped}} acoustic horn used to amplify a person’s voice or other sounds and direct it {{in a given}} direction. The sound is introduced into the narrow end <b>of</b> the <b>megaphone,</b> by holding {{it up to the}} face and speaking into it, and the sound waves radiate out the wide end. A megaphone increases the volume of sound by increasing the acoustic impedance seen by the vocal cords, matching the impedance of the vocal cords to the air, so that more sound power is radiated. It also serves to direct the sound waves in the direction the horn is pointing. It somewhat distorts the sound of the voice because the frequency response <b>of</b> the <b>megaphone</b> is greater at higher sound frequencies.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1972 and 1974 Christian Ide Hintze {{worked as}} a Super-8 filmmaker and street singer in Scandinavia, England, France and Spain, between 1974 and 1978 - in {{addition}} to studying theater and communications at the University of Vienna - as a distributor <b>of</b> <b>megaphone,</b> poster and leaflet texts in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Holland. His actions resulted in numerous charges of [...] "obstructing pedestrian traffic" [...] and [...] "contamination of public buildings". In 1976 {{he was arrested and}} interrogated by the police in East Berlin. In 1978 he was expelled from the book fair in Stuttgart and convicted of criminal damage in Vienna (for pasting banners, posters and poems onto the Burgtheater). In 1979 the Austrian filmmaker Alfred Kaiser published a film about his work in public spaces.|$|R

5000|$|Both Samuel Morland and Athanasius Kircher {{have been}} {{credited}} <b>of</b> inventing <b>megaphones</b> {{around the same}} time in the 17th century.

40|$|The {{isolation}} and elucidation {{of the structure}} and stereochemistry <b>of</b> <b>megaphone</b> (l), a new cytotoxic neolignan from Aniba rnegaphylla Mez., are reported. Chemical and spectral evidence supported structure 1 for megaphone, and a direct x-ray crystallographic analysis confirmed the structure and established the stereochemistry. Two addi-tional new cytotoxic neolignans, megaphone acetate (2) and megaphyllone acetate (3), were isolated and their struc-tures deduced {{in light of the}} structure of 1. The lack of activity of these neolignans as inhibitors of mitosis in sea ur-chin eggs is discussed in terms of structural features. An alcoholic extract of Aniba megaphylla Mez. (Laura-ceae) 5 was found to demonstrate inhibitory activity in vitro against cells derived from human carcinoma of the naso-pharynx (KB) ? Systematic fractionation of the active ethanol extract (Chart I) guided by KB activity led to the isolation of three new cytotoxic neolignans, megaphone (l), megaphone acetate (2), and megaphyllone acetate (3) ...|$|R
40|$|Interactive digital {{technologies}} {{embedded in}} urban spaces typically {{tend to be}} used to deliver news, context-relevant information and commercial advertisements. To design urban technologies that will serve other ends, we first need to know how people might want to interact with them. Using an ethnographic approach, we collected field data in order to better understand this. This study presents some of the findings of our qualitative evaluation <b>of</b> <b>MÉGAPHONE,</b> an interactive artistic installation deployed in a public space in downtown Montréal, Canada. In this paper, we provide thick descriptions of our detailed field observations and interviews with participants conducted over the ten-week deployment with a deep focus on how users appropriated this system. Our results highlight four public interaction strategies as a set of abstractions that suggest how people might want to make use of interactive public installations: place-making, self-representing, first-person news reporting and bootstrapping online presence with digital recordings.

They have come under attack from a range of factions in student politics, including Liberal students, both Left and Right Labor students and claim to have been slandered by the Australasian Union of Jewish Students, for their strong opposition to the state of Israel.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{social media}} {{have become a}} mirror for many adolescents: young people {{experiment}} online, testing their own limits and possibilities, and they build their identity day by day (Boyd, 2014). The consequences of this new behaviour are important and include sexting (Temple, 2012, 2014), self-exposure, self-objectification and identity manipulation. Many of these behaviours pass through the media themselves, as they work as a sort <b>of</b> <b>megaphone</b> or extensive sharing platform. This paper aims to reach two goals. The first is to share a new perspective with educators and researchers named Peer&Media Education (Ottolini & Rivoltella, 2014) —a model developed {{in recent years to}} reach young people and foster their “awareness” of media and their health (Ottolini & Rivoltella, 2014). The result is a new methodological framework fostering the responsible use of social media and digital tools and also helping young people to keep healthy habits. We will present the framework in sections 1 and 2. The second goal is to discuss the results of the research Image. ME, run by Cremit, which studied the uses of social network sites, their impact on relationships and identity and the incidence of risky behaviours. In fact, the research is built according to the Peer&Media Education perspective, preventing risky behaviours and supporting media awareness. We will discuss this in section 3. </p...|$|R
