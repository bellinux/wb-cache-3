5|$|The {{planning}} {{system is}} critical to the viability and operation of GA aerodromes. With many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them, and with GA access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive, a viable network of aerodromes supporting GA air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue. However, there is no unified <b>national</b> <b>planning</b> <b>policy</b> specific to GA aerodromes, and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact. Because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation, the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process, and this issue is the principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to GA land use are made. GA is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to Local Planning Authorities, and most planning decisions relating to GA either refuse permission, or grant it with restrictive conditions. Little Gransden is just one example of a GA airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on the number of movements permitted, thereby inhibiting further development. Such restrictions, if poorly conceived, can make GA operations unviable or even unsafe.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} existing land use patterns on housing supply price elasticities in local areas of England, under existing <b>planning</b> <b>policies.</b> The paper demonstrates that, despite common <b>national</b> <b>planning</b> <b>policies,</b> local supply responses to market pressures vary considerably, because of differences in historical land uses. The study area covers the Thames Gateway and Thames Valley, which lie {{to the east and}} west of London respectively. However, whereas the latter is one of the wealthiest areas of England, the former includes some of the highest pockets of deprivation and was a government priority area for increasing housing supply. Due to differences in historical land use and geography, the price elasticity in the least constrained area is approximately six times higher than the most constrained. ...|$|R

The research itself consists of a review of the spatial content of a series of sectoral policy documents published by the National Assembly for Wales. In addressing the character and extent of spatial references across different policy sectors, emphasis is placed on the potential for spatial planning instruments to facilitate 'joined-up' policy and address complex issues of geographic distribution and spatial equity. The article concludes that a spatial planning approach, if successfully developed and enhanced, offers real value in the development of public policy...|$|R
