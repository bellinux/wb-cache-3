5|$|The Allies had {{previously}} employed several deceptions against the region (for example Operation Hardboiled in 1942 and Operation Cockade in 1943). As a result, John Bevan, {{head of the}} London Controlling Section (LCS) and charged with overall organisation of Bodyguard, was concerned that visual/wireless deception would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> create a believable threat.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland {{concluded}} that the Viet Cong still had the strength to continue the attacks on Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> drive the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E

5|$|Opposition to {{the project}} was based on three {{separate}} objections to its construction: ecological, human, and financial. Conservation groups opposed the dam's construction because it would flood the Yukon Flats, a large wetland area that provides breeding ground for millions of waterfowl and habitat for game and fur-bearing animals. Alaska Native groups objected {{to the project}}'s human cost—the need to relocate more than 1,500 people and 9 villages—and Native groups outside the reservoir area objected to the potential devastation of the Yukon River salmon population. The third objection to construction of the dam stemmed from its high cost {{and the belief that}} cheap electricity would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> attract industry to Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{debate whether}} Smilodon was social. One study of African predators found that social predators like lions and spotted hyenas respond {{more to the}} {{distress}} calls of prey than solitary species. Since S.fatalis fossils are common at the La Brea Tar Pits, and were likely attracted by the distress calls of stuck prey, this could mean that this species was social as well. One critical study claims that the study neglects other factors, such as body mass (heavier animals {{are more likely to}} get stuck than lighter ones), intelligence (some social animals, like the American lion, may have avoided the tar because they were better able to recognize the hazard), lack of visual and olfactory lures, the type of audio lure, and the length of the distress calls (the actual distress calls of the trapped prey animals would have lasted longer than the calls used in the study). The author of that study ponders what predators would have responded if the recordings were played in India, where the otherwise solitary tigers are known to aggregate around a single carcass. The authors of the original study responded that though effects of the calls in the tar pits and the playback experiments would not be identical, this would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> overturn their conclusions. In addition, they stated that weight and intelligence would not likely affect the results as lighter carnivores are far more numerous than heavy herbivores and the social (and seemingly intelligent) dire wolf is also found in the pits.|$|E

25|$|Money value fluctuates over time: $100 {{today has}} a {{different}} value than $100 in five years. This is because one can invest $100 today in an interest-bearing bank account or any other investment, and that money will grow/shrink due to the rate of return. Also, if $100 today allows the purchase of an item, {{it is possible that}} $100 will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> purchase the same item in five years, because of inflation (increase in purchase price).|$|E

25|$|The {{aftermath}} of the Rising, {{and in particular the}} British reaction to it, helped sway a large section of Irish nationalist opinion away from hostility or ambivalence and towards support for the rebels of Easter 1916.

25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{builds on}} the flood basalt eruption theory. An increase in temperature of five degrees Celsius would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> explain the death of 95% of life. But such warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures until frozen methane reservoirs below the ocean floor near coastlines melted, expelling enough methane (among the most potent greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere to raise world temperatures an additional five degrees Celsius. The frozen methane hypothesis helps explain the increase in carbon-12 levels found midway in the Permian–Triassic boundary layer. It also helps explain why {{the first phase of}} the layer's extinctions was land-based, the second was marine-based (and starting right after the increase in C-12 levels), and the third land-based again.|$|E
25|$|When the JILA team {{raised the}} {{magnetic}} field strength further, the condensate suddenly reverted to attraction, imploded and shrank beyond detection, then exploded, expelling about two-thirds of its 10,000 atoms. About half of the atoms in the condensate seemed to have disappeared from the experiment altogether, not seen in the cold remnant or expanding gas cloud. Carl Wieman explained that under current atomic theory this characteristic of Bose–Einstein condensate could not be explained because the energy state of an atom near absolute zero should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause an implosion; however, subsequent mean field theories have been proposed to explain it. Most likely they formed molecules of two rubidium atoms, energy gained by this bond imparts velocity sufficient to leave the trap without being detected.|$|E
25|$|When an {{inductive}} circuit is opened, the current through the inductance collapses quickly, creating a large voltage {{across the open}} circuit of the switch or relay. If the inductance is large enough, the energy may generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> damage the switch but may still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package.|$|E
