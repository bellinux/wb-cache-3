Any profits from such a book would be given to charity. During {{a news conference at}} Hollywood's Kodak Theatre in 2007, Rowling, when asked how the encyclopaedia was coming along, said, [...] "It's not coming along, and I haven't started writing it. I <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was the next thing I'd do." [...] At the end of 2007, Rowling said that the encyclopaedia could take up to ten years to complete.|$|E
500|$|The Andy Griffith Show [...] is an American {{situation}} comedy which aired on CBS from October 3, 1960, to September 6, 1971, {{with a total}} of 249 half-hour episodes spanning over 8 seasons, first in black and white and then in color, which partially originated from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show. It originally starred Andy Griffith in the role of Andy Taylor, the widowed sheriff of the fictional small community of Mayberry, North Carolina. Other major characters include Andy's inept but well-meaning deputy, who is also his cousin, Barney Fife (Don Knotts); Andy's spinster aunt and housekeeper, [...] "Aunt" [...] Bee Taylor (Frances Bavier), and Andy's precocious young son, Opie (Ron Howard). Eccentric townspeople and temperamental girlfriends complete the cast. Regarding the tone of the show, Griffith said that despite a contemporary setting, the show evoked nostalgia, stating in a Today Show interview: [...] "Well, though we <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> and though it was shot in the '60s, it had a feeling of the '30s. It was, when we were doing it, of a time gone by." ...|$|E
2500|$|Healey's notably bushy {{eyebrows and}} {{piercing}} wit {{earned him a}} favourable reputation with the public. When the media were not present, his humour was equally caustic but more risqué: [...] "These fallacies [...] are rising up everywhere," [...] he retorted {{at a meeting of}} Leeds University Labour Society. The popular impressionist Mike Yarwood coined the catchphrase [...] "Silly Billy", and incorporated it into his shows as a supposed [...] "Healey-ism". Healey had <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> until that point, but he adopted it and used it frequently. Healey's direct speech made enemies. [...] "At a meeting of the PLP I accused Ian Mikardo of being 'out of his tiny Chinese mind' – a phrase of the comedienne Hermione Gingold, with which I thought everyone was familiar. On the contrary, when it leaked to the press, the Chinese Embassy took it as an insult to the People's Republic." [...] The controversy may have contributed to a poor performance when he fought for the Labour leadership following Harold Wilson's resignation. He obtained 30 votes in the first ballot on 25 March, and 38 in the second on 30 March. He was eliminated from the election and supported James Callaghan in the final ballot on 5 April. Callaghan was elected as the new Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party, and retained Healey as Chancellor.|$|E

And these are your passion and your acts and your thoughts and expressions, your developing consciousness. You don't know beforehand, and you can't. You can only stick to your own soul through thick and thin.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the thought}} a sob rose, and poor Jill laid {{her head down}} on her lap to cry with all her heart, feeling very helpless, small, and forsaken alone there on the great sea.

6000|$|She {{told herself}} a {{thousand}} inspiriting things {{which he would}} say {{if he had the}} opportunity; for them she admired him, loved him. But she was afraid to summon him. He understood, he did not come. She forgot her every doubt of him, and her discomfort in his background. Each day it seemed impossible to get through the desolation of not seeing him. Each morning, each afternoon, each evening was a compartment divided from all other units of time, distinguished by a sudden [...] "Oh! I want to see Erik!"
