5|$|Curium {{isotopes}} {{are inevitably}} present in {{spent nuclear fuel}} with a concentration of about 20 g/tonne. Among them, the 245Cm–248Cm isotopes have decay times {{of thousands of years}} and need to be removed to <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> fuel for disposal. The associated procedure involves several steps, where curium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure, nuclear transmutation, while well documented for other elements, is still being developed for curium.|$|E

5|$|On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) {{landed on}} Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The {{landings}} {{on the islands}} were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia. They were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> major Japanese base at Rabaul and support the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.|$|E

Batman destroys the Cloudburst and convinces Ivy to empower an ancient tree that can <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> toxin; she succeeds and saves Gotham, but the strain kills her, while Batman's exposure to the toxin strengthens Joker's control. Batman pursues the Arkham Knight to a construction site to rescue Gordon. The Knight reveals himself as Jason Todd, the previous Robin, who was seemingly murdered by the Joker, and has been left traumatized by torture at the Joker's hands. Todd blames Batman for abandoning him, and although Batman offers to help Todd recover, he escapes. Batman and Gordon confront Scarecrow on the building's roof, where Oracle is revealed to be alive, and her suicide {{the result of a}} hallucination. Batman rescues Oracle and returns her to the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD), but Scarecrow escapes with Gordon. Using the remaining militia, Scarecrow assaults the GCPD to eliminate Batman's allies. Batman and Oracle <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> militia, but Scarecrow uses the distraction to kidnap Robin.|$|E

5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had central nervous system manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E

This provoked the reaction of various provincial governors {{as well as that}} of powerful interest groups in Baghdad itself, such as the caliphal bodyguards. Against them, Ibn Ra'iq employed Bajkam and his Turkish supporters. With their aid, he managed to <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> Hujari and Saji guard units, after which, in February 937, Bajkam was rewarded with the posts of sahib al-shurta (chief of police) and governor of the eastern provinces.|$|E
5|$|In late June 1942, the Allies {{decided to}} seize {{bases in the}} {{southern}} Solomon Islands {{with the objective of}} denying their use by the Japanese to threaten the supply and communication routes between the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. They also intended to use Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases to support a campaign to eventually capture or <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. Admiral Nimitz committed much of the Pacific Fleet to the task, including three of his four carrier task forces. They fell under the command of the recently appointed Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of the South Pacific Area.|$|E

5|$|Jogaila's Russian mother Uliana of Tver {{urged him}} to marry Sofia, {{daughter}} of Prince Dmitri of Moscow, who required him first to convert to Orthodoxy. That option, however, was unlikely to halt the crusades against Lithuania by the Teutonic Knights, who regarded Orthodox Christians as schismatics and little better than heathens. Jogaila chose therefore to accept a Polish proposal to become a Catholic and marry the eleven-year-old Queen Jadwiga of Poland. The nobles of Lesser Poland made this offer to Jogaila for many reasons. They wanted to <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> dangers posed by Lithuania itself and to secure the fertile territories of Galicia–Volhynia. The Polish nobles saw the offer {{as an opportunity for}} increasing their privileges and avoiding Austrian influence, brought by Jadwiga's previous fiancé William, Duke of Austria.|$|E
5|$|MACV intelligence, on {{the other}} hand was {{convinced}} that the incursion would be only lightly opposed. Tactical air strikes and artillery preparations would <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> estimated 170 to 200 anti-aircraft artillery weapons believed to be in the area, and the threat posed by PAVN armored units was considered minimal. North Vietnamese reinforcement capability was set at 14 days by two divisions north of the DMZ, and it was hoped that diversionary operations would occupy them {{for the duration of the}} operation. Unfortunately, when North Vietnamese reinforcements did arrive, they did not come from the north as expected, but from Base Area 611 and the A Shau Valley to the south, where eight regiments, all supported by organic artillery units, were within two weeks marching range.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{share the}} view that the militants {{escalated}} the conflict toward violence on the basis of false information transmitted by duplicitous individuals or groups attempting to <b>neutralize</b> <b>the</b> nationalist influence. Members of VVS and Jiny involved in the initial attacks have stated that their organizations were obliged to attack after the signal to take action was transmitted to them by a group that was later discovered to have secret ties to the national police. Researchers have documented reports of nationalists whose member organizations joined the conflict upon commands issued by the police, British nationals, and French settlers living in Madagascar. Despite the role of the militants in leading the uprising, the colonial authorities immediately held MDRM responsible for the movement and responded by targeting the party's members and supporters.|$|E
