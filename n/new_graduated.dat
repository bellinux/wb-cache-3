To further complicate problems in the development of amphibious warfare amongst the Marine Corps was that they were organized for aggressive, but limited objectives, instead of extensive operations that fully relied on larger ground forces that were capable of sustaining longer in combat, due to being well-funded and equipped. A notable result of the ATC was the deployment of Engineer Amphibian Brigades (later called Engineer Special Brigades), which were largely responsible for much of the amphibious resupply doctrine still in use by the United States Marine Corps today.|$|E

40|$|Globally, soda {{taxes are}} gaining {{momentum}} as powerful interventions to discourage sugar consumption and thereby reduce the growing burden of obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Evidence from early adopters including Mexico and Berkeley, California, confirms that soda taxes can disincentivize consumption through price increases and raise revenue to support government programs. The United Kingdom’s <b>new</b> <b>graduated</b> levy on sweetened beverages is yielding yet another powerful impact: soda manufacturers are reformulating their beverages to {{significantly reduce the}} sugar content. Product reformulation – whether incentivized or mandatory – helps reduce overconsumption of sugars at the societal level, {{moving away from the}} long-standing notion of individual responsibility in favor of collective strategies to promote health. But as a matter of health equity, soda product reformulation should occur globally, especially in low- and middleincome countries (LMICs), which are increasingly targeted as emerging markets for soda and junk food and are disproportionately impacted by NCDs.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the perceptions of}} physiotherapists concerning the preparedness of <b>new</b> <b>graduates</b> to use electrophysical agents (EPAs) in clinical practice. Design: An observational cross-sectional questionnaire was developed and demonstrated to be reliable and valid. Participants The questionnaire was mailed to all registered physiotherapists in Australia in 2005 (n = 12, 893). Results: In total, 3538 questionnaires were returned complete. Two forms of non-responder analysis indicated that the sample and their associated responses were representative of the Australian physiotherapy population. Eight out of 10 <b>new</b> <b>graduates</b> felt prepared to use EPAs that are common in Australian clinical practice. However, 80 % felt underprepared to use a range of other EPAs.

Roles of designers {{are becoming more and more}} varied, and at the same time other professionals are increasingly using design tools in their business, organizational or other innovation projects. New terms such as ‘service design’, ‘design thinking’, or even ‘co-creation’ are quite popular at the moment, but confusing as well: depending on the discipline people mean very different processes or methodologies with these terms. In this paper, we zoom in on the rise of service design. Service design is a user-centred approach to design, just as industrial design is. The contexts of users and their needs, motivations and feelings are starting points for the design process. In the form of a think tank, we critically reflected on current developments in design practice in order to tune the industrial design profession to the latest developments of design practice. Besides a better understanding of what service design brings and how it relates to industrial design practice, we explicitly formulated suggestions for current industrial design curricula, since many <b>new</b> <b>graduated</b> design students do projects in, and find jobs in service design projects.

40|$|On April 1, 1994, Ontario, Canada, {{instituted a}} <b>new</b> <b>graduated</b> driver license (GDL) system that {{effectively}} set the legal {{blood alcohol content}} (BAC) threshold at zero {{for the first few}} years of a youth's driving eligibility. I use data from the 1983 - 2001 Ontario Student Drug Use Surveys (OSDUS) to examine whether the Zero Tolerance (ZT) policy reduced self-reported drinking and alcohol-involved driving among youth. I find that rates of drunk driving reported by 16 - to 17 -year-olds-who faced new, lower legal limits after adoption of the ZT policy-were about 5 percentage points lower after the law was implemented. Visual inspection of the data, however, shows that the estimated reduction is an artifact of a pre-existing trend: Drunk driving rates in this age group were falling steadily throughout the 1980 s and into the 1990 s. Estimates that account for this pre-existing trend or that consider shorter windows around the 1994 implementation date return effects on alcohol-involved driving that are either small and statistically insignificant or large and implausibly signed (positive). These null findings are robust to using the associated change in outcomes for slightly younger (14 - 15) or slightly older (19 - 20) youths as controls in a difference-in-differences framework. I similarly find no robust effect on drinking participation. This suggests that Ontario's age-targeted drunk driving law-despite being harsher than similar policies in the United States-was not responsible for reductions in Canadian youth road fatalities over the past two decades. © 2006 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management...|$|E
40|$|O currículo por competências deverá preparar o aluno para um saber-fazer crítico, reflexivo, ser parte ativa do contexto social, mobilizar recursos, que resolvam problemas surgidos no exercício profissional. Investigou-se, entre cirurgiões-dentistas do serviço público do Rio Grande do Norte, dificuldades em saúde coletiva, para estabelecer um perfil de competências no novo currículo. Coletaram-se os dados pelo teste de associação livre de palavras e entrevista, analisados pelo EVOC 2000 e análise de conteúdo. As dificuldades dos entrevistados foram trabalhar em equipe, falta de compromisso dos gestores com a continuidade das ações, despreparo profissional para enfrentar problemas coletivos, além da precarização do trabalho. Considerando o perfil profissional sugerido pelas novas diretrizes curriculares, os resultados sinalizam para mudanças no currículo, fundamentadas nas diretrizes, formando profissionais compatíveis com as exigências do mercado de trabalho, incluindo as competências saber, saber-fazer, saber-ser, com visão questionadora da própria prática. Quanto mais rápido os cursos de odontologia aderirem as mudanças, mais provavelmente os profissionais formados a partir delas estarão capacitados do ponto de vista de competências e habilidades para lidar com dificuldades surgidas.

The main difficulties found were: working in teams, lack of commitment of managers with the continuity of the health actions, unprepared professionals to face the collective problems, and the precariousness of work. Considering the profile of the health professional suggested by the new curriculum guidelines, the results signal for a need for changes in the curriculum, to graduate professionals compatible with the requirements of the actual labour market, which includes knowledge, know-how and know-be, with a critic view.

40|$|This {{study was}} based upon the {{requirements}} of the Scope of Practice of the Registered Nurses (R 2598 of 1984 as amended) as prescribed by the South African Nursing Council. The clinical competency of <b>new</b> <b>graduate</b> nurses, with regard to the care of individual clients, depends on their ability to correlate theoretical knowledge learned in the classroom with practice and the development of clinical skills. Its foundation lies in the ability to identify and solve problems that emanate from critical thinking, analytic reasoning and reflective practice. It is clear that the quality of clinical exposure plays {{a leading role in the}} development of learners into nursing professionals. Nursing skills alone cannot ensure quality care of clients without the application of theory. Facilitation of this theory to practice remains, therefore, an essential component of nursing education. This study was aimed at identifying areas of incompetence of <b>new</b> <b>graduate</b> nurses (1998 - 2001) in the clinical area, by determining the <b>new</b> <b>graduates</b> and professional nurses perceptions of the competence of the <b>new</b> <b>graduate</b> nurses. The intention was to make recommendations regarding the identified areas of incompetence. Descriptive research was found appropriate to the study, using the parameters of the Scope of Practice of the Registered Nurse (R 2598 of 1984 as amended) A quantitative non-experimental descriptive survey was undertaken to generate information on the clinical competence of <b>new</b> <b>graduate</b> nurses (1998 - 2001). Shortage of staff, equipment and supplies negatively affect the competency of <b>new</b> <b>graduate</b> nurses. <b>New</b> <b>graduate</b> nurses are expected to perform beyond their scope of practice and there is discrepancy between what the <b>new</b> <b>graduate</b> nurses learned in the classroom and what they see in the clinical area. Orientation programmes need to be reviewed and they are often neglected due to shortage of staff. Findings with regard to performance of <b>new</b> <b>graduate</b> nurses: Ethics and professional practice need to be emphasized and graduates educated regarding the rights of patients. <b>New</b> <b>graduate</b> nurses have sufficient theoretical knowledge but lack competency in basic nursing skills due to an inability to correlate theory to practice. <b>New</b> <b>graduate</b> nurses are perceived to be arrogant and perceive themselves as having a higher education or qualifications. College graduates are perceived to be more competent than university graduates because of their "extensive" exposure to clinical practice. <b>New</b> <b>graduate</b> nurses consider themselves to be above certain basic skills after completion of training. Conclusions that can be drawn from this study are that there are many factors that impact negatively on the competency of <b>new</b> <b>graduate</b> nurses.

40|$|ENGLISH SUMMARY Conviction {{and regret}} {{related to the}} choice of {{education}} and profession among <b>new</b> <b>graduated</b> registered nurses (RNs) in Norway. This paper focuses on the attitudes of new graduate RNs in Norway towards their choice of education and profession. It {{is a part of}} an ongoing prospective cohort study with the title “Working career and career values among new graduate RNs”, financed by Western Norway Regional Health Authority and Bergen Deaconess University College. The project emphasises the partnership between the institutions of education and the employers for creating nurses dedicated for the profession. The sample consists of the total population of RNs who graduated in the year 2000 from the six University Colleges in western Norway, a total of 590 nurses. Data used in this study were collected from questionnaires 1 and 3 ½ years after graduation. In the study we analyse one open question (free comments submitted by the respondents) concerning conviction or regret related to the choice of nursing education, and several questions with bound categories for answers focusing on their attitudes towards the choice of profession and career plans. 1 and 3 ½ years after graduation 2 out of 3 RNs believed they were working within the nursing profession in ten years, while only 1 out of 3 believed they would do so the rest of their working career. 1 out of 3 stated that they sometimes regret their choice of RN education. What characterise the convinced RNs compared to the regretful? Pearson's correlation coefficient shows significant positive associations with: Pride in being a nurse, pride in the type of work, educational satisfaction, job satisfaction, feeling secure in the occupational role and positive professional status among friends. Logistic regression analyses shows significant association with: Age, original wish for study, attended university college and attending a present further education. By analysing what the nurses were amplifying when they were asked to express their attitude of conviction or regret with their own words we got better insight in the reasons and circumstances referred. “The convinced” RNs explain about: Enjoying the work as nurse, a careful plan for the choice of education, satisfaction with the content of the education and it’s contribution for personal growth and the nursing education as a building block for further education and career. “The regretful” RNs explain about: Heavy work load, heavy responsibility, unsocial (inconvenient) working hours and problems with combining work with family life, low salaries and valuation and the nursing profession compared to other professions...|$|E
40|$|Reported by Statewide Coordinator for PHCRED, Mrs Lyn Brun The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Fremantle Campus was a buzz of {{activity}} {{at the end of}} November as over 40 early to mid-career researchers assembled to discuss their latest findings. It was fitting that the conference was staged at Fremantle this year, as it was four years ago that the <b>new</b> <b>graduated</b> entry program for medicine began at Notre Dame with the first cohort of graduates from the School of Medicine due to graduate on Saturday 13 December, 2008. Topics were varied and covered a number of interesting and current Primary Health Care issues related to the theme of ‘Primary Health Care MATTERS!’ Delegates travelled from across the State, as far a field as Albany and Margaret River in the south to Geraldton and Broome in the north. Delegates were impressed with the School of Medicine as a venue ant the opportunity to hear topics as varied as the prevalence and severity of surfing related injuries in the South West to the implementation and evaluation of palliative rural respite service. Professor Tom Brett, Director of Notre Dame’s General Practice and Primary Health Care Research Unit, explained, “ Research into primary health care generally tends to be poorly funded but the PHCRED program, who convenes these annual get -togethers, has been successfully adopted by the three units (UWA, CUCRH 2 ̆ 6 UNDA) and is reflected in the numbers of attendees at the event. ” Speaker, Associate Professor Lyn Henderson-Yates, Coordinator of Aboriginal Studies at Notre Dame’s Broome Campus, provided an indigenous perspective on primary health care. Practice – based research networks were also a hot topic of discussion as keynote speaker, Professor Nick Zwar from the University of New South Wales, discussed the need for more research in general practice and primary health care as a whole.

40|$|Newly {{licensed}} drivers on {{a provisional}} or intermediate licence {{have the highest}} crash risk when compared with any other group of drivers. In comparison, learner drivers have the lowest crash risk. Graduated driver licensing is one countermeasure that has been demonstrated to effectively reduce the crashes of novice drivers. This thesis examined the graduated driver licensing systems in two Australian states {{in order to better}} understand the behaviour of learner drivers, provisional drivers and the supervisors of learner drivers. By doing this, the thesis investigated the personal, social and environmental influences on novice driver behaviour as well as providing effective baseline data against which to measure subsequent changes to the licensing systems. In the first study, conducted prior to the changes to the graduated driver licensing system introduced in mid- 2007, drivers who had recently obtained their provisional licence in Queensland and New South Wales were interviewed by telephone regarding their experiences while driving on their learner licence. Of the 687 eligible people approached to participate at driver licensing centres, 392 completed the study representing a response rate of 57. 1 per cent. At the time the data was collected, New South Wales represented a more extensive graduated driver licensing system when compared with Queensland. The results suggested that requiring learners to complete a mandated number of hours of supervised practice impacts on the amount of hours that learners report completing. While most learners from New South Wales reported meeting the requirement to complete 50 hours of practice, it appears that many stopped practising soon after this goal was achieved. In contrast, learners from Queensland, who were not required to complete a specific number of hours {{at the time of the}} survey, tended to fall into three groups. The first group appeared to complete the minimum number of hours required to pass the test (less than 26 hours), the second group completed 26 to 50 hours of supervised practice while the third group completed significantly more practice than the first two groups (over 100 hours of supervised practice). Learner drivers in both states reported generally complying with the road laws and were unlikely to report that they had been caught breaking the road rules. They also indicated that they planned to obey the road laws once they obtained their provisional licence. However, they were less likely to intend to comply with recommended actions to reduce crash risk such as limiting their driving at night. This study also identified that there were relatively low levels of unaccompanied driving (approximately 15 per cent of the sample), very few driving offences committed (five per cent of the sample) and that learner drivers tended to use a mix of private and professional supervisors (although the majority of practice is undertaken with private supervisors). Consistent with the international literature, this study identified that very few learner drivers had experienced a crash (six per cent) while on their learner licence. The second study was also conducted prior to changes to the graduated driver licensing system and involved follow up interviews with the participants of the first study after they had approximately 21 months driving experience on their provisional licence. Of the 392 participants that completed the first study, 233 participants completed the second interview (representing a response rate of 59. 4 per cent). As with the first study, at the time the data was collected, New South Wales had a more extensive graduated driver licensing system than Queensland. For instance, novice drivers from New South Wales were required to progress through two provisional licence phases (P 1 and P 2) while there was only one provisional licence phase in Queensland. Among the participants in this second study, almost all provisional drivers (97. 9 per cent) owned or had access to a vehicle for regular driving. They reported that they were unlikely to break road rules, such as driving after a couple of drinks, but were also unlikely to comply with recommended actions, such as limiting their driving at night. When their provisional driving behaviour was compared to the stated intentions from the first study, the results suggested that their intentions were not a strong predictor of their subsequent behaviour. Their perception of risk associated with driving declined from when they first obtained their learner licence to when they had acquired provisional driving experience. Just over 25 per cent of participants in study two reported that they had been caught committing driving offences while on their provisional licence. Nearly one-third of participants had crashed while driving on a provisional licence, although few of these crashes resulted in injuries or hospitalisations. To complement the first two studies, the third study examined the experiences of supervisors of learner drivers, as well as their perceptions of their learner’s experiences. This study was undertaken after the introduction of the <b>new</b> <b>graduated</b> driver licensing systems in Queensland and New South Wales in mid- 2007, providing insights into the impacts of these changes from the perspective of supervisors. The third study involved an internet survey of 552 supervisors of learner drivers. Within the sample, approximately 50 per cent of participants supervised their own child. Other supervisors of the learner drivers included other parents or stepparents, professional driving instructors and siblings. For two-thirds of the sample, this was the first learner driver that they had supervised. Participants had provided an average of 54. 82 hours (sd = 67. 19) of supervision. Seventy-three per cent of participants indicated that their learners’ logbooks were accurate or very accurate in most cases, although parents were more likely than non-parents to report that their learners’ logbook was accurate (F (1, 546) = 7. 74, p =. 006). There was no difference between parents and non-parents regarding whether they believed the log book system was effective (F (1, 546) =. 01, p =. 913). The majority of the sample reported that their learner driver had had some professional driving lessons. Notwithstanding this, a significant proportion (72. 5 per cent) believed that parents should be either very involved or involved in teaching their child to drive, with parents being more likely than non-parents to hold this belief. In the post mid- 2007 graduated driver licensing system, Queensland learner drivers are able to record three hours of supervised practice in their log book for every hour that is completed with a professional driving instructor, up to a total of ten hours. Despite this, there was no difference identified between Queensland and New South Wales participants regarding the amount of time that they reported their learners spent with professional driving instructors (X 2 (1) = 2. 56, p =. 110). Supervisors from New South Wales were more likely to ensure that their learner driver complied with the road laws. Additionally, with the exception of drug driving laws, New South Wales supervisors believed it was more important to teach safety-related behaviours such as remaining within the speed limit, car control and hazard perception than those from Queensland. This may be indicative of more intensive road safety educational efforts in New South Wales or the longer time that graduated driver licensing has operated in that jurisdiction. However, other factors may have contributed to these findings and further research is required to explore the issue. In addition, supervisors reported that their learner driver was involved in very few crashes (3. 4 per cent) and offences (2. 7 per cent). This relatively low reported crash rate is similar to that identified in the first study. Most of the graduated driver licensing research to date has been applied in nature and lacked a strong theoretical foundation. These studies used Akers’ social learning theory to explore the self-reported behaviour of novice drivers and their supervisors. This theory was selected as it has previously been found to provide a relatively comprehensive framework for explaining a range of driver behaviours including novice driver behaviour. Sensation seeking was also used in the first two studies to complement the non-social rewards component of Akers’ social learning theory. This program of research identified that both Akers’ social learning theory and sensation seeking were useful in predicting the behaviour of learner and provisional drivers over and above socio-demographic factors. Within the first study, Akers’ social learning theory accounted for an additional 22 per cent of the variance in learner driver compliance with the law, over and above a range of socio-demographic factors such as age, gender and income. The two constructs within Akers’ theory which were significant predictors of learner driver compliance were the behavioural dimension of differential association relating to friends, and anticipated rewards. Sensation seeking predicted an additional six per cent of the variance in learner driver compliance with the law. When considering a learner driver’s intention to comply with the law while driving on a provisional licence, Akers’ social learning theory accounted for an additional 10 per cent of the variance above socio-demographic factors with anticipated rewards being a significant predictor. Sensation seeking predicted an additional four per cent of the variance. The results suggest that the more rewards individuals anticipate for complying with the law, the more likely they are to obey the road rules. Further research is needed to identify which specific rewards are most likely to encourage novice drivers’ compliance with the law. In the second study, Akers’ social learning theory predicted an additional 40 per cent of the variance in self-reported compliance with road rules over and above socio-demographic factors while sensation seeking accounted for an additional five per cent of the variance. A number of Aker’s social learning theory constructs significantly predicted provisional driver compliance with the law, including the behavioural dimension of differential association for friends, the normative dimension of differential association, personal attitudes and anticipated punishments. The consistent prediction of additional variance by sensation seeking over and above the variables within Akers’ social learning theory in both studies one and two suggests that sensation seeking is not fully captured within the non social rewards dimension of Akers’ social learning theory, at least for novice drivers. It appears that novice drivers are strongly influenced by the desire to engage in new and intense experiences. While socio-demographic factors and the perception of risk associated with driving had an important role in predicting the behaviour of the supervisors of learner drivers, Akers’ social learning theory provided further levels of prediction over and above these factors. The Akers’ social learning theory variables predicted an additional 14 per cent of the variance in the extent to which supervisors ensured that their learners complied with the law and an additional eight per cent of the variance in the supervisors’ provision of a range of practice experiences. The normative dimension of differential association, personal attitudes towards the use of professional driving instructors and anticipated rewards were significant predictors for supervisors ensuring that their learner complied with the road laws, while the normative dimension was important for range of practice. This suggests that supervisors who engage with other supervisors who ensure their learner complies with the road laws and provide a range of practice to their own learners are more likely to also engage in these behaviours. Within this program of research, there were several limitations including the method of recruitment of participants within the first study, the lower participation rate in the second study, an inability to calculate a response rate for study three and the use of self-report data for all three studies. Within the first study, participants were only recruited from larger driver licensing centres to ensure that there was a sufficient throughput of drivers to approach. This may have biased the results due to the possible differences in learners that obtain their licences in locations with smaller licensing centres. Only 59. 4 per cent of the sample in the first study completed the second study. This may be a limitation if there was a common reason why those not participating were unable to complete the interview leading to a systematic impact on the results. The third study used a combination of a convenience and snowball sampling which meant that it was not possible to calculate a response rate. All three studies used self-report data which, in many cases, is considered a limitation. However, self-report data may be the only method that can be used to obtain some information. This program of research has a number of implications for countermeasures in both the learner licence phase and the provisional licence phase. During the learner phase, licensing authorities need to carefully consider the number of hours that they mandate learner drivers must complete before they obtain their provisional driving licence. If they mandate an insufficient number of hours, there may be inadvertent negative effects as a result of setting too low a limit. This research suggests that logbooks may be a useful tool for learners and their supervisors in recording and structuring their supervised practice. However, it would appear that the usage rates for logbooks will remain low if they remain voluntary. One strategy for achieving larger amounts of supervised practice is for learner drivers and their supervisors to make supervised practice part of their everyday activities. As well as assisting the learner driver to accumulate the required number of hours of supervised practice, it would ensure that they gain experience in the types of environments that they will probably encounter when driving unaccompanied in the future, such as to and from education or work commitments. There is also a need for policy processes to ensure that parents and professional driving instructors communicate effectively regarding the learner driver’s progress. This is required as most learners spend at least some time with a professional instructor despite receiving significant amounts of practice with a private supervisor. However, many supervisors did not discuss their learner’s progress with the driving instructor. During the provisional phase, there is a need to strengthen countermeasures to address the high crash risk of these drivers. Although many of these crashes are minor, most involve at least one other vehicle. Therefore, there are social and economic benefits to reducing these crashes. If the new, post- 2007 graduated driver licensing systems do not significantly reduce crash risk, there may be a need to introduce further provisional licence restrictions such as separate night driving and peer passenger restrictions (as opposed to the hybrid version of these two restrictions operating in both Queensland and New South Wales). Provisional drivers appear to be more likely to obey some provisional licence laws, such as lower blood alcohol content limits, than others such as speed limits. Therefore, there may be a need to introduce countermeasures to encourage provisional drivers to comply with specific restrictions. When combined, these studies provided significant information regarding graduated driver licensing programs. This program of research has investigated graduated driver licensing utilising a cross-sectional and longitudinal design in order to develop our understanding of the experiences of novice drivers that progress through the system in order to help reduce crash risk once novice drivers commence driving by themselves...|$|E
