40|$|Two {{bypassing}} {{agents are}} currently available {{to circumvent the}} need for factor FVIII in hemophilia A patients with inhibitors: the activated prothrombin complex FEIBA VH and recombinant activated factor VII (<b>NovoSeven</b> (R)). Both products are highly effective in controlling bleeding {{in the presence of}} inhibitory alloantibodies, yet their hemostatic efficacy can be unpredictable. As the results of the FEIBA <b>NovoSeven</b> (R) Comparative (FENOC) study illustrate, patients may respond better to one bypassing agent than the other. Furthermore, guidelines from an expert panel reflect that responsiveness to bypassing therapy may change from one bleed to the next in the same patient and even from hour to hour {{during the course of a}} single bleeding event. These findings underscore the need to have both bypassing products available to treat bleeding episodes in inhibitor patients, to frequently evaluate the efficacy of hemostasis during the course of a bleeding event, and to switch products early if the response to treatment is unsatisfactory.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveA {{number of}} {{hemophilia}} A patients who receive clotting factors may develop antibodies (inhibitors) against clotting factors. The immune tolerance induction (ITI) method {{has proved to}} be a very cost-effective alternative to bypassing agents. Iran's national health authority is interested in implementing the ITI method for the management of hemophilia patients with inhibitors. The objective of this study was to calculate the breakeven point between costs attributed to the ITI method and the use of bypassing agents for the management of high-responder hemophilia patients with inhibitors. MethodsThis study assessed costs attributed to the implementation of ITI for the management of Iranian hemophilia patients with costs of high-titer and high-responding inhibitors from the perspective of the national health system. The main objective was to find the breakeven point for the ITI method in comparison with the use of bypassing medicine, recombinant factor VIIa (<b>Novoseven).</b> ResultsBased on the sensitivity analysis performed, the breakeven point mainly depends on costs of factor VIII, <b>Novoseven,</b> and the success rate of the ITI intervention. According to this analysis, the breakeven point of ITI and <b>Novoseven</b> methods varies between 16 and 34 months posttreatment. The optimized point is about 17 months posttreatment. ConclusionsIran's national health system spends more than 24 million euros for providing bypassing agents to about 124 hemophilia patients with inhibitors. Because of limited resources available in Iran's health sector, this is a huge burden. Results of this study show that the implementation of the ITI method for the management of Iranian hemophilia patients with inhibitors is a cost-saving method and Iran's health system will recover all the expenditure related to the implementation of ITI in less than 2 years and will make a considerable saving along with providing standard care for these patients...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Congenital factor VII (FVII) {{deficiency}} {{is a rare}} {{bleeding disorder}} with high phenotypic vari-ability, and optimal management {{has yet to be}} determined. Treatment has traditionally involved FVII replacement therapy using fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates or plasma-de-rived FVII concentrates. Recombinant activated FVII (rFVIIa, <b>NovoSeven),</b> the first recombinant treat-ment option, has recently been approved in the European Union for use in congenital FVII defici-ency, but has been available on an emergency and compassionate use basis since 1988. In FVII defici-ency, rFVIIa serves as substitution therapy as it provides the physiological ligand (FVIIa) for tissue factor, its receptor exposed at the site of vascular injury. This paper provides an overview of published and unpublished experience with rFVIIa in patients with congenital FVII deficiency from the <b>NovoSeven</b> compassionate and emergency use programmes (1988 – 99) and of independent reports in the litera-ture. Recombinant FVIIa has been reported to provide effective haemostasis in patients of all ages and in a range of bleeding situations, including acute central nervous system/life-threatening bleeding epi-sodes (15 episodes in 12 patients), non-life-threaten-ing bleeding episodes (> 32 episodes in 17 patients), surgery (> 40 interventions in 25 patients) and child-birth (three women). Preliminary reports suggest that it may also be effective prophylactically. The risk of thrombosis in FVII-deficient patients treated with rFVIIa is unknown, as is the occurrence of inhibiting antibodies. A postlicensure pharmacovigilance regis-try (Seven Treatment Evaluation Registry) has been set up to continue to monitor the efficacy and safety (including alloantibody development) of rFVIIa in patients with FVII deficiency...|$|E

Administration of rFVIIa as a continuous infusion is a very attractive option and precludes the need for very frequent (2 -h) injections due to the very short half-life of the product. Successful major surgery has been performed in patients with high titre inhibitors using continuous infusion of rFVIIa.

40|$|BackgroundMost recent {{publications}} {{have shown}} that the recombinant form of activated factor VII (rFVIIa; <b>NovoSeven,</b> Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark) induces excellent hemostasis in patients with severe intractable bleeding caused by trauma and major surgery. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the influence of rFVIIa on the treatment of intractable perioperative bleeding in vascular surgery when conventional hemostatic measures are inadequate. Materials and MethodsThere were two groups of patients: the <b>NovoSeven</b> group (group N), 10 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (RAAAs) and 14 patients operated on due to thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs); the control group (group C), 14 patients with RAAAs and 17 patients with TAAAs. All patients suffered intractable hemorrhage refractory to conventional hemostatic measures, while patients from group N were additionally treated with rFVIIa. ResultsPostoperative blood loss was significantly lower in group N treated with rFVII (P <. 0001). Postoperative administration of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets was lower in patients from group N, (P <. 0001). Successful hemorrhage arrest was reported in 21 patients (87. 5 %) treated with rFVIIa, and in 9 patients (29. 03 %) in group C (P <. 001). Thirty-day mortality in these two groups significantly differed. The mortality rate was 12. 5 % (3 patients) in group N and 80. 65 % (25 patients) in group C (P <. 0001). ConclusionOur findings suggest that rFVIIa may play a role in controlling the intractable perioperative and postoperative bleeding in surgical patients undergoing a repair of RAAAs and TAAAs. Certainly, prospective randomized trials are necessary to further confirm the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of rFVIIa in these patients...|$|E

40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{responsible for}} the hemostatic efficacy of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; <b>NovoSeven</b> (R), Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) in platelet-related bleeding disorders remain unclear. The general concept is that rFVIIa locally enhances thrombin generation {{at the site of}} injury, where tissue factor (TF) has become exposed. However, a growing amount of evidence shows that rFVIIa is also able to exert its activity in a manner independent of TF. Using an in vitro flow model, we recently showed that TF-independent thrombin generation is responsible for increased platelet deposition onto injured vessels following rFVIIa administration. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} rFVIIa can restore platelet aggregation in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT) patients via TF-independent thrombin generation. However, the mechanism behind TF-independent thrombin generation remains to be elucidated. It is postulated that, in vivo, both the TF-dependent and TF-independent thrombin generation induced by rFVIIa contribute to the control of hemorrhage in patients with platelet-related bleeding disorders and, perhaps, other causes of hemorrhagic diatheses...|$|E
