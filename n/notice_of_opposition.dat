25|$|Before {{starting}} the substantive {{examination of the}} opposition, the Opposition Division examines whether the opposition must be considered as filed ("Is there an opposition?") and whether it is admissible ("Is the opposition admissible?"). The Opposition Division may find that the opposition is not deemed to have been filed, for instance because the opposition fee has not been paid within the nine-month opposition period, because the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> is not signed or because the notice is not in an accepted language.|$|E
25|$|An {{opposition}} {{can only}} {{be based on a}} limited number of grounds, i.e. {{on the grounds that the}} subject-matter of the patent is not patentable, that the invention is insufficiently disclosed, or that the content of the patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed. The <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> to a European patent must be filed in writing at the EPO (either at Munich, The Hague or Berlin), along with the payment of an opposition fee, within nine months from the publication of the mention of the grant of the patent in the European Patent Bulletin. Opposition Divisions of the EPO are responsible for the examination of oppositions. The opposition procedure may involve multiple opponents. According to the EPO, a European patent was once opposed by a record number of 27 opponents.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze current {{legislation}} <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination and refer {{to some of the}} questionable area of this termination. The thesis also offers some of the proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. Reasons of these proposals are that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination of employment as unilateral legal act brings negative aftermath mainly for employee, but in some cases also for employer and legislation should prevent these negative effects or at least minimized them. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination, with an emphasis on legal act, because <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements.
