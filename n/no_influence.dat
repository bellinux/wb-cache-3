5|$|In general relativity, no {{material}} body {{can catch up}} with or overtake a light pulse. <b>No</b> <b>influence</b> from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ("compactified") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.|$|E

Her court was replete with Germans and Dutch, who formed a base for {{the interests of the}} House of Habsburg. By 1524 Mary negotiated significant authority and influence for herself. In 1525, she took control over one powerful political faction and neutralised another. Austria's ambassador, Andrea de Borgo, was appointed by the Queen herself.|$|E

5|$|This {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} the Pacific War Council, which met for the first time in London on 10 February 1942. Churchill, Clement Attlee (Deputy Prime Minister) and Anthony Eden (Foreign Secretary) represented the United Kingdom, and Earle Page represented Australia, along with representatives from the Netherlands, New Zealand, India and China. Page was replaced as the Australian representative by Stanley Bruce in June 1942. A parallel Pacific War Council was created in Washington, D.C., that first met on 1 April 1942. It was chaired by Roosevelt, with Richard Casey and later Owen Dixon representing Australia, and Prime Minister Mackenzie King representing Canada. The Pacific War Council never became an effective body, and had <b>no</b> <b>influence</b> on strategy, but did allow the Dominions to put their concerns before the President.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} 4th century, the Christian {{community}} was small, poor, and carried <b>no</b> <b>influence</b> in the city. The church was insignificant and its members {{were not allowed to}} hold political office. However, conversion to Christianity in Gaza was spearheaded under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420. In 402, after obtaining a decree from the emperor, he ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed and idol worship was forbidden by the Byzantine government. Paganism continued and Christians were still persecuted in the city, forcing St. Porphyrius to undertake more measures. As a result of his persuasion, Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas in 406. (Note that according to MacMullen it is likely that Porphyrius did not even exist.) Persecution against Christians did not cease, but it was less harsh and frequent than previously. A large 6th century synagogue with a mosaic tile floor depicting King David was discovered in Gaza. An inscription states that the floor was donated in 508–509 CE by two merchant brothers. Around 540, Gaza became the starting point for pilgrimages to the Sinai Peninsula. It was an important city in the early Christian world and many famous scholars taught at its academy of rhetoric, including 6th-century scholar Procopius of Gaza. The celebrated Church of Saint Sergius was built in this century.|$|E

40|$|Nitric oxide {{influences}} muscle {{physiology and}} meat quality Over the last 15 years, the physiological role of nitric oxide (NO) has gained prominence in biomedical literature, {{emerging as a}} regulator of many cellular processes. Importantly, the formative enzyme NO synthase (NOS) {{was found to have}} high levels of activity in skeletal muscle and the activity of the neuronal isoform of NOS was higher in muscle than in the brain. Roles for NO in the regulation of muscle contractility, energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and proteolysis have emerged. Since many of these processes are critical determinants of meat quality, the hypothesis of this thesis is that <b>NO</b> <b>influences</b> physiological determinants of meat quality. To evaluate if <b>NO</b> <b>influenced</b> meat quality, inhibitors of NOS and pharmacological donors of NO were injected at concentrations of I, 10 and lOOmM into hot boned beef Longissimus lumborum (LL).
