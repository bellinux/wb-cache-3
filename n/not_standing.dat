5|$|Roosevelt was {{receiving}} many letters from supporters {{urging him to}} run, and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf. Balked on many policies by an unwilling Congress and courts in his full term in the White House, he saw manifestations of public support he believed would sweep him to the White House with a mandate for progressive policies that would brook no opposition. In February, Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him. Taft felt that if he lost in November, {{it would be a}} repudiation of the party, but if he lost renomination, it would be a rejection of himself. He was reluctant to oppose Roosevelt, who helped make him president, but having become president, he was determined to be president, and that meant <b>not</b> <b>standing</b> aside to allow Roosevelt to gain another term.|$|E

25|$|Parliament was {{dissolved}} {{and house}} elections scheduled for 24 July 1988, with Prem again <b>not</b> <b>standing</b> for election.

Thousands protested {{in front of}} Prem's house against {{the prospect of an}} unelected premier, until Prem finally announced that he would not accept the premiership. The Chart Thai party, led by General Chatichai Choonhavan, won the most seats in the election, and Chatichai became the new premier.|$|E

Meanwhile, Murrow, and even some of Murrow's Boys, felt that Shirer was coasting on his high reputation and not working hard enough to bolster his analyses with his own research. Murrow and Shirer never regained their close friendship.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of trade unionist James Mawdsley as a Conservative candidate caused {{some degree of}} protest. The Royton branch of his union passed (by 107 to 54 votes) a motion protesting at his candidature, and Mawdsley was asked why he had not come forward as a Labour candidate when invited to in 1895. Mawdsley replied {{that there had been}} a decision to run two candidates: one being Liberal-Labour and the other (himself) a Conservative-Labour candidate. He further said that he would support a Liberal-Labour candidate. The Independent Labour Party, despite <b>not</b> <b>standing</b> a candidate, held a meeting calling on working men to free themselves from both established parties. It was reported that the Conservatives accepted Mawdsley as a candidate on the assumption that if elected, he would be allowed to express his own views on trade union issues.|$|E
25|$|Powell's {{experience}} in military matters {{made him a}} very popular figure with both American political parties. Many Democrats admired his moderate stance on military matters, while many Republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past Republican administrations. Put forth as a potential Democratic Vice Presidential nominee in the 1992 U.S. presidential election or even potentially replacing Vice President Dan Quayle as the Republican Vice Presidential nominee, Powell eventually declared himself a Republican and began to campaign for Republican candidates in 1995. He was touted as a possible opponent of Bill Clinton in the 1996 U.S. presidential election, possibly capitalizing on a split conservative vote in Iowa and even leading New Hampshire polls for the GOP nomination, but Powell declined, citing a lack of passion for politics. Powell defeated Clinton 50–38 in a hypothetical match-up proposed to voters in the exit polls conducted on Election Day. Despite <b>not</b> <b>standing</b> in the race, Powell won the Republican New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary on write-in votes.|$|E

So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just like really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E
