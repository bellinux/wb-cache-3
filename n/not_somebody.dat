[...] Nelle Porter says, [...] "I admire the way you don't let yourself be pushed around. Too many people when they think they've been wronged just walk away." [...] Jeff Yang, founding publisher of A Magazine, a New York-based publication on Asian American culture, sees Ling as [...] "a strong Asian woman who's clearly potent, clearly has control. She's not a victim, <b>not</b> <b>somebody</b> who lets anyone come even close to victimizing her." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} Goldwyn in 1989, Berg {{began the}} search for his next subject, who {{he wanted to be}} [...] "another great American cultural figure but — because I had written about Perkins and Goldwyn — <b>not</b> <b>somebody</b> from the worlds of publishing or film". After briefly considering Tennessee Williams, Berg decided to research the aviator Charles Lindbergh, attracted by what he described as [...] "the dramatic possibilities of the story of the great hero who became a great victim and a great villain". Berg convinced Lindbergh's widow, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, to grant him unprecedented access to the man's archives, which he was surprised to find totaled [...] "1,300 boxes, or several million papers".|$|E
500|$|In the 1860s and 1870s ever larger {{forces were}} assembled. Bernard Shaw, {{in his role}} as a music critic, commented, [...] "The stale wonderment which the great chorus never fails to elicit has already been exhausted"; he later wrote, [...] "Why, instead of wasting huge sums on the multitudinous {{dullness}} of a Handel Festival does <b>not</b> <b>somebody</b> set up a thoroughly rehearsed and exhaustively studied performance of the Messiah in St James's Hall with a chorus of twenty capable artists? Most of us would be glad to hear the work seriously performed once before we die." [...] The employment of huge forces necessitated considerable augmentation of the orchestral parts. Many admirers of Handel believed that the composer would have made such additions, had [...] the appropriate instruments been available in his day. Shaw argued, largely unheeded, that [...] "the composer may be spared from his friends, and the function of writing or selecting 'additional orchestral accompaniments' exercised with due discretion." ...|$|E

500|$|Loeb talked {{further on}} the subject in July 2016, reiterating the issue of {{scheduling}} by saying [...] "if I'm shooting a television series and that's {{going to go on}} over a six-month or eight-month period, how am I going to get [...] {{to be able to go}} be in a movie?" [...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or <b>not</b> <b>somebody</b> is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card I would love to see played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E

The game was based on similar lotteries outside of Australia, such as Cash4Life in the US.|$|E
2500|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{was mentioned}} throughout {{the second season}} of Larry David's HBO program Curb Your Enthusiasm. However, the Emmy award-winning success of Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the CBS sitcom The New Adventures of Old Christine led many {{to believe that she}} had broken the curse. In her acceptance speech, Louis-Dreyfus held up her award and exclaimed, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>somebody</b> who really believes in curses, but curse this, baby!" [...] The show was on the air for five seasons starting March 13, 2006 before its cancellation on May 18, 2010; the series produced enough episodes to air in reruns in syndication for several years, something the other shows didn't achieve. The Saturday Night Live episode guest-hosted by Louis-Dreyfus made references to the curse. Louis-Dreyfus went on to win six further Lead Actress in a Comedy Emmys for her acclaimed performance as Vice President Selina Meyer in HBO's comedy series Veep.|$|E
