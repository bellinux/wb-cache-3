5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a <b>name</b> <b>change</b> are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a <b>name</b> <b>change</b> versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action.
