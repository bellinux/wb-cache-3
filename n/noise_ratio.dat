25|$|Reflected signals decline {{rapidly as}} {{distance}} increases, so noise introduces a radar range limitation. The noise floor and signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio</b> {{are two different}} measures of performance that affect range performance. Reflectors that are too far away produce too little signal to exceed the noise floor and cannot be detected. Detection requires a signal that exceeds the noise floor by at least the signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

40|$|Pre-emphasis {{schedules}} {{are given}} for 11 constant-bandwidth FM subcarriers modulating an S band transmitter at three receiver signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios</b> (i. e., 9, 15, and 25 dB). The criterion for establishing these pre-emphasis curves is the achievement, at various receiver intermediate frequency signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios,</b> of equal receiver output signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios</b> for all channels. It is realized that these curves {{may not be}} the optimum pre-emphasis curves based on overall efficiency or maximum utilization of the allotted spectrum, but they are near-optimum for data with channels which require equal output signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios,</b> such as spectral densities. The empirically derived results are compared with a simplified, analytically derived schedule and the primary differences are explained. The S band pre-emphasis schedule differs from the lower frequency VHF case. Since most proportional bandwidth and constant bandwidth systems use ground based recorders and some use flight recorders (as the Saturn systems did on VHF proportional bandwidth telemetry), the effects of these recorders are discussed and a modified pre-emphasis schedule is presented showing {{the results of this study}} phase...|$|R
25|$|Also in 1991, Georges Cornuéjols {{introduced}} the HDR+ image principle by non-linear accumulation of images {{to increase the}} sensitivity of the camera: for low-light environments, several successive images are accumulated, thus increasing the signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

25|$|The use {{of better}} {{modulation}} techniques, such as QPSK or {{those used in}} modern modems, combined with the improved bandwidth and signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio</b> of newer cassette tapes, allowed much greater capacities (up to 60 MB) and data transfer speeds of 10 to 17kB/s on each cassette.

40|$|In this paper, {{a robust}} and novel {{approach}} for optimal bit allocation between source and channel coding is proposed. The proposed approach {{consists of a}} wavelet-based scalable video coding framework and a forward error correction method based on the serial concatenation of LDPC codes and turbo codes. Turbo codes shows good performance at low signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios</b> but LDPC outperforms turbo codes at high signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios.</b> So the concatenation of LDPC and TC enhances the performance at both low and high signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios.</b> The scheme reduces the video distortion at the decoder under band-with constraints. The reduction is achieved by efficiently protecting the different quality layers from channel errors. Furthermore, an efficient decoding algorithm is proposed that reduces the decoding complexity of channel decoder. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed approach outperforms conventional forward error correction techniques. 1...|$|R
25|$|This is {{a measure}} of how much noise is {{introduced}} in the amplification process. Noise is an undesirable but inevitable product of the electronic devices and components; also, much noise results from intentional economies of manufacture and design time. The metric for noise performance of a circuit is noise figure or noise factor. Noise figure is a comparison between the output signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio</b> and the thermal noise of the input signal.|$|E

40|$|A method, {{using the}} concept of local means and local {{standard}} deviations of small imaging blocks and using a box counting procedure, has been developed for unsupervised estimation of the average signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios</b> of images in which the noise is additive. The method {{has been applied to}} simulated images with Gaussian noise, to images acquired with the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer and with the Geophysical and Environmental Research Imaging Spectrometer. The method is compared with other techniques for estimating signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios</b> from imaging data. It is believed that the method is generally applicable to images having many small homogeneous blocks. Because the method {{does not take into account}} interband effects, it is not appropriate to use the method to estimate signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios</b> from images having nonnegligible interband radiometric calibration errors at spatial scales less than or equal to the size of the small imaging blocks used in the noise estimation...|$|R
25|$|The {{governor}} received {{relatively little}} scientific attention until James Clerk Maxwell published a paper that established {{the beginning of}} a theoretical basis for understanding control theory. Development of the electronic amplifier during the 1920s, which was important for long distance telephony, required a higher signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio,</b> which was solved by negative feedback noise cancellation. This and other telephony applications contributed to control theory. In the 1940s and 1950s, German mathematician Irmgard Flugge-Lotz developed the theory of discontinuous automatic controls, which found military applications during the Second World War to fire control systems and aircraft navigation systems.|$|E
25|$|Spatially encoded {{frequency}} domain OCT (SEFD-OCT, spectral domain or Fourier domain OCT) extracts spectral information by distributing different optical frequencies onto a detector stripe (line-array CCD or CMOS) via a dispersive element (see Fig. 4). Thereby the information {{of the full}} depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the large signal to noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single photosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR (signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio)</b> advantage of ~10 dB at much higher speeds. This is {{not much of a}} problem when working at 1300nm, however, since dynamic range is not a serious problem at this wavelength range.|$|E
25|$|In {{frequency}} domain OCT (FD-OCT) the broadband interference is acquired with spectrally separated detectors (either by encoding the optical frequency {{in time with}} a spectrally scanning source or with a dispersive detector, like a grating and a linear detector array). Due to the Fourier relation (Wiener-Khintchine theorem between the auto correlation and the spectral power density) the depth scan can be immediately calculated by a Fourier-transform from the acquired spectra, without movement of the reference arm. This feature improves imaging speed dramatically, while the reduced losses during a single scan improve the signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio</b> proportional {{to the number of}} detection elements. The parallel detection at multiple wavelength ranges limits the scanning range, while the full spectral bandwidth sets the axial resolution.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Rapid code phase {{synchronization}} {{is a difficult}} challenge for Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum systems that utilize long spreading codes. Current synchronization techniques have been limited to either exhaustive search over the spreading code time-frequency uncertainty region, or various ad hoc techniques, which work only at high Signal to <b>Noise</b> <b>Ratios.</b> This paper presents an entirely new approach to the code acquisition problem based on the adaptation of convolutional decoding techniques. The method is denoted STARS for State Transition Assisted Receiver/Synchronizer. STARS is much faster than the traditional code search process, and can operate at very low signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R
40|$|Chirped wavelets are {{utilized}} to detect dispersed signals {{in the joint}} time scale domain. Specifically, pulses that become dispersed by transmission through the ionosphere and are received by satellites as nonlinear chirps are investigated. Since the dispersion greatly lowers the signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios,</b> {{it is difficult to}} isolate the signals in the time domain. Satellite data are examined with discrete wavelet expansions. Detection is accomplished via a template matching threshold scheme. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the chirped wavelet detection scheme is successful in detecting the transionospheric pulses at very low signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R

25|$|The HDD's {{electronics}} {{control the}} movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk, and perform reads and writes on demand from the disk controller. Feedback of the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to servo feedback. These are either complete concentric circles (in the case of dedicated servo technology), or segments interspersed with real data (in the case of embedded servo technology). The servo feedback optimizes the signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio</b> of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice-coil of the actuated arm. The spinning of the disk also uses a servo motor. Modern disk firmware is capable of scheduling reads and writes efficiently on the platter surfaces and remapping sectors of the media which have failed.|$|E
25|$|Most older {{hearing aids}} have only an {{omnidirectional}} microphone. An omnidirectional microphone amplifies sounds equally from all directions. In contrast, a directional microphone amplifies sounds from one direction more than sounds from other directions. This means that sounds originating {{from the direction}} the system is steered toward are amplified more than sounds coming from other directions. If the desired speech arrives {{from the direction of}} steering and the noise is from a different direction, then compared to an omnidirectional microphone, a directional microphone provides a better signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio.</b> Improving the signal-to-noise ratio improves speech understanding in noise. Directional microphones {{have been found to be}} the second best method to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (the best method was an FM system, which locates the microphone near the mouth of the desired talker).|$|E
500|$|Particular {{attention}} has been paid to the function of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that phenothiazine drugs, which block dopamine function, could reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also supported by the fact that amphetamines, which trigger the release of dopamine, may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. The influential dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that excessive activation of D2 receptors was the cause of (the positive symptoms of) schizophrenia. Although postulated for about 20years based on the D2 blockade effect common to all antipsychotics, it was not until the mid-1990s that PET and SPET imaging studies provided supporting evidence. While dopamine D2/D3 receptors are elevated in schizophrenia, the effect size is small, and only evident in medication naive schizophrenics. On the other hand, presynaptic dopamine metabolism and released is elevated despite no difference in dopamine transporter. The altered synthesis of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system have been confirmed in several human studies. Hypoactivity of dopamine D1 receptor activation in the prefrontal cortex has also been observed. [...] The hyperactivity of D2 receptor stimulation and relative hypoactivity of D1 receptor stimulation is thought to contribute to cognitive dysfunction by disrupting signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio</b> in cortical microcircuits. [...] The dopamine hypothesis is now thought to be simplistic, partly because newer antipsychotic medication (atypical antipsychotic medication) can be just as effective as older medication (typical antipsychotic medication), but also affects serotonin function and may have slightly less of a dopamine blocking effect.|$|E

2500|$|Stacking seismic {{data from}} a {{reflection}} survey is useful because it was collected with a predictable, controlled source. [...] When the source is uncontrolled and unpredictable, stacking the data only degrades the signal. Because recorded shear wave time delays and polarizations vary in their incidence angle and azimuth of radio propagation, stacking these arrivals will degrade the signal and decrease the signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio,</b> resulting in a plot that is noisy and hard to interpret at best.|$|E

Hot Jupiters have the greatest gravitational effect on their host stars because they have relatively small orbits and large masses. Observation of many separate spectral lines and many orbital periods allows the signal to <b>noise</b> <b>ratio</b> of observations to be increased, increasing the chance of observing smaller and more distant planets, but planets like the Earth remain undetectable with current instruments.|$|E
