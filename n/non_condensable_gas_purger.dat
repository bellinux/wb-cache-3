The intermediate pyrolysis has a residence time ranging from 5 to 10 minutes. The main product yields from sewage sludge pyrolysis are 50 wt% biochar, 40 wt% bio-oil and 10 wt% <b>non</b> <b>condensable</b> <b>gases.</b> The project was carried out on a pilot plant scale reactor with a load capacity of 20 kg/h. This enabled a high yield of biochar and bio-oil. The characterisation of the products indicated that the organic phase of the bio-oil had good fuel properties such as having high energy content of 39 MJ/kg, low acid number of 21. 5, high flash point of 150 and viscosity of 35 cSt. An increase in pyrolysis experiments enabled large quantities of pyrolysis oil production. Co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge was carried out on laboratory scale with mixed wood, rapeseed and straw. It found that there was an increase in bio-oil quantity with rapeseed while co-pyrolysis with wood helped to mask the smell of the sludge pyrolysis oil. Engine test were successfully carried out in an old Lister engine with pyrolysis oil fractions of 30 % and 50 % blended with biodiesel. This indicates that these pyrolysis oil fractions can be used in similar engine types without any problems however long term effects in ordinary engines are unknown.

Like other regional gas-phase chemistry mechanisms, the species set was designed to capture the net reactivity of hundreds of individual emitted VOCs, but in addition, low-vapour-pressure, high-molecular-mass compounds with particulate-forming potential have also been represented in some detail in this species set. CEPS 1. 1 was then used to estimate VOC emissions for this species set from the 1990 Canadian and U. S. national emissions inventories for a grid covering most of North America with a 127 / 3 -km grid spacing. The gridded and speciated VOC emissions were then {{used in conjunction with}} gas/particle partitioning theory to estimate the amount of organic aerosol that would result from four source types: (a) direct emissions of low-volatility <b>condensable</b> <b>gases</b> from anthropogenic sources; (b) direct emissions of low-volatility <b>condensable</b> <b>gases</b> from biogenic sources; (c) <b>condensable</b> <b>gases</b> formed from the reaction of non-condensable anthropogenic precursor gases; and (d) <b>condensable</b> <b>gases</b> formed from the reaction of non-condensable biogenic precursor gases.

In September 1998, average nucleation mode particle concentrations were 8600 cm- 3 during clean air events and 2200 cm- 3 during polluted events.

Peak concentrations often reached 500, 000 - 1, 000, 000 cm- 3 during the most intense events and the duration of the events ranged from 2 to 8 hours with a mean of 4. 5 hours. Source rates for detectable particle sizes (d > 3 nm) were estimated to be between 104 and 106 cm- 3 s- 1 and initial growth rates of new particles were as high as 0. 1 - 0. 35 nm s- 1 at the tidal source region.

It is very difficult to distinguish between individual the contributions, especially because the pores have no uniform pore diameter. Two basic types of experiments were made to study the transport mechanisms of a <b>condensable</b> <b>gas</b> (butane) through a Vycor membrane: steady state permeation and measurements of liquid flux. Steady state experiments enable to study butane transport for different concentration profiles in the pores. Measurements of liquid flux are indispensable for the verification of the presence of condensate in pores during gas permeation. Differences between the liquid butane flux (on high pressure side of membrane is liquid, on opposite side is gas) and the gas flux (at both sides butane is in the gas phase) for the same pressure gradients across the membrane were observed. The difference between these fluxes decreases with decreasing of pressure gradients. For a pressure gradient higher than 2 bars (liquid butane P 1 = 2. 25 bar; P 2 = 0 bar, gas butane P 1 = 2. 24 bar; P 2 = 0 bar) the flux of the liquid butane is approximately 2 times higher. The ratio of liquid and gas fluxes decreases to 1. 7 for pressure conditions P 1 = 2. 24 - 2. 25 and P 2 = 0. 98 bar. No difference between liquid and gas fluxes was registered for the low pressure gradient investigated (P 1 = 2. 22 bar; P 2 = 1. 91 bar).

In this work permeation and binary diffusion experiments have been performed at ambient temperature in combination with measurements of the adsorption isotherms using porous Vycor glass possessing a mean pore radius of approximately 4 nm. Main focus was set on {{a comparison of the}} transport of (a) permanent gases (helium, nitrogen, methane and hydrogen) and (b) <b>condensable</b> <b>gases</b> (butane, propane and freon 112) {{as a function of the}} pressure conditions in the membrane.

There is a good agreement between the volume of condensate at saturation and the pore volume determined in independent porosimetric studies. Results of a large set of experiments with butane revealed that the permeation is only a function of the mean gas pressure in the membrane. This contradicts the available models suggested in (J.

40|$|Off-gas surging is {{inherent}} {{to the operation}} of slurry-fed melters. Although the melter design and the feed chemistry are both known to significantly affect off-gas surging, the frequency and intensity of surges are in essence unpredictable. In typical off-gas surges, both <b>condensable</b> and <b>non</b> <b>condensable</b> flows spike simultaneously. Condensable or steam surges have been observed to occur as the boiling water layer occasionally falls into the crevices of the cold cap or flows over {{the edges of the}} cold cap, thereby coming in contact with the melt surface. The resulting steam surges can pressurize the melter considerably and, therefore, are responsible for the bulk of pressure transients that propagate throughout the off-gas system. The <b>non</b> <b>condensable</b> surges occur as the calcine gases that have been accumulating within the cold cap finally build up enough pressure to be released through the temporary openings of the cold cap. The analysis of off-gas data has shown that over 90 of the gas released during a surge is due to steam. 1 Therefore, it is essential to have a large inventory of water in the cold cap for any significant pressure spikes to occur. With the Melter 2 vapor space temperature typically running at 720 C, the water layer in the cold cap will quickly evaporate once the feeding stops, and the potential for any large pressure spikes should practically cease to exist. The analysis also showed that large pressure spikes well above 2 inches H 2 O cannot occur under the steam surge scenarios described above. More severe conditions should prevail and one such condition would be that the feed materials form a mound with a growing lake on top, while the melt below remains very fluidic due to its low viscosity, thus resulting in greater movements both in the lateral as well as vertical directions. Once the mound begins to grow, its rate should accelerate, since the heat transfer rate to the upper regions of the cold cap is inversely proportional to the cold cap thickness. Then, when the mound reaches some critical mass, it may begin sink into the bulk melt or tip over, thereby creating a condition almost like a steam explosion...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric cloud {{condensation}} nuclei (CCN) concentrations {{are a key}} {{uncertainty in}} the assessment of the effect of anthropogenic aerosol on clouds and climate. The ability of new ultrafine particles to grow to become CCN varies throughout the atmosphere and must be understood in order to understand CCN formation. We have developed the Probability of Ultrafine particle Growth (PUG) model to answer questions regarding which growth and sink mechanisms control this growth, how the growth varies between different parts of the atmosphere and how uncertainties with respect to the magnitude and size distribution of ultrafine emissions translates into uncertainty in CCN generation. The inputs to the PUG model are the concentrations of <b>condensable</b> <b>gases,</b> the size distribution of ambient aerosol, particle deposition timescales and physical properties of the particles and <b>condensable</b> <b>gases.</b> It was found in most cases that condensation is the dominant growth mechanism and coagulation with larger particles is the dominant sink mechanism for ultrafine particles. In this work we found that the probability of a new ultrafine particle generating a CCN varies from < 0. 1 % to ~ 90 % {{in different parts of the}} atmosphere, though in the boundary layer a large fraction of ultrafine particles have a probability between 1 % and 40 %. Some regions, such as the tropical free troposphere, are areas with high probabilities; however, variability within regions makes it difficult to predict which regions of the atmosphere are most efficient for generating CCN from ultrafine particles. For a given mass of primary ultrafine aerosol, an uncertainty of a factor of two in the modal diameter can lead to an uncertainty in the number of CCN generated as high as a factor for eight. It was found that no single moment of the primary aerosol size distribution, such as total mass or number, is a robust predictor of the number of CCN ultimately generated. Therefore, a complete description of the emissions size distribution is generally required for global aerosol microphysics models...|$|R
30|$|One {{promising}} {{method of}} removing very small CPs is the cryogenic aerosol technique {{in which the}} contaminated surface is bombarded by fine, high-velocity bullet particles (BPs) made of volatile material. CPs on the surface can be removed if the energy transferred from BPs to the CP is sufficient to overcome the adhesion energy between the CP and the substrate [7, 8]. In the conventional form of this technology, <b>condensable</b> <b>gas</b> is pre-cooled close to liquid nitrogen temperature and, then, expanded through a simple nozzle such as a cylindrical hole. Cooling liquefies some of the condensable gas; expansion of the gas through the nozzle atomizes the liquid into fine droplets, and adiabatic cooling causes solid particles to form during further expansion. Typical particle size is a few microns, and typical velocity is 100 m/s. The minimum size of CP that can be removed efficiently using these micron-sized particles is approximately 50 nm [6 – 10].|$|R
40|$|Within the {{production}} of synthetic natural gas - basically methane-from solid feed stock such as coal or biomass the major conversion step is gasification, generating a product gas containing a mixture of permanent and <b>condensable</b> <b>gases,</b> as well as solid residues. The gasification step can be conducted in different atmospheres and using different reaction agents. This chapter discusses the role of gasification for the overall substitute natural gas (SNG) process, and the basic thermodynamic aspects within gasification. The gasification process {{is a series of}} different conversions involving both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. The basic steps from solid fuel to product gas are drying, pyrolysis, and gasification. From a technological viewpoint, there basically exist three different gasification reactor types that are used at large scale: fixed bed reactors, entrained flow reactors, and fluidized bed reactors. Coal is mainly used in entrained flow gasification or fixed bed units, whereas biomass gasification is mostly done in fluidized bed reactors. © 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that shock wave data for: (1) low {{temperature}} <b>condensable</b> <b>gases</b> H 2 and He, (2) H 2 O, CH 4, NH 3, CO, CO 2, and N 2 ices, and (3) silicates, metals, oxides and sulfides have many applications in geophysics and planetary science. The present paper is concerned with such applications. The composition of planetary interiors is discussed, {{taking into account the}} division of the major constituent of the planets in three groups on the basis of 'cosmic abundance' arguments, the H-He mixtures in the case of Jupiter and Saturn, shock wave data for hydrogen, and constraints on the internal structure of Uranus and Neptune. Attention is also given to the earth's mantle, shock wave data for mantle materials, the earth's core, impacts on planetary surfaces, elastic wave velocities as a function of pressure along the Hugoniot of iron, and reactions which yield the CO 2 bearing atmospheres for Venus, earth, and Mars...|$|R
40|$|Cross-linked {{polymers}} {{of intrinsic}} microporosity (PIM) s for gas separation membranes, were prepared by a nitrene reaction from a representative PIM {{in the presence}} of two different diazide cross-linkers. The reaction temperature was optimized using TGA. The homogenous membranes were cast from THF solutions of different ratios of PIM to azides. The resulting cross-linked structures of the PIMs membranes were formed at 175 °C after 7. 5 h and confirmed by TGA, XPS, FT-IR spectroscopy and gel content analysis. These resulting cross-linked polymeric membranes showed excellent gas separation performance and can be used for O 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /N 2 gas pairs, as well as for <b>condensable</b> <b>gases,</b> such as CO 2 /CH 4, propylene/propane separation. Most importantly, and differently from typical gas separation membranes derived from glassy polymers, the crosslinked PIMs showed no obvious CO 2 plasticization up to 20 atm pressure of pure CO 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 mixtures. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|The {{time and}} purge gas usage {{required}} to purge a multilayer insulation (MLI) panel with gaseous helium {{by means of}} gas diffusion to obtain a <b>condensable</b> <b>gas</b> (nitrogen) concentration of less than 1 percent within the panel are stipulated. Two different, flat, rectangular MLI panels, one incorporating a butt joint, were constructed of of 11 double-aluminized Mylar (DAM) radiation shields separated by Dacron tuft spacers. The DAM/Dacron tuft concept is known commercially as Superfloc. The nitrogen gas concentration {{as a function of}} time within the MLI panel could be adequately predicted by using a simple, one dimensional gas diffusion model in which the boundary conditions {{at the edge of the}} MLI panel were time dependent. The time and purge gas usage required to achieve 1 percent nitrogen gas concentration within the MLI panel varied from 208 to 86 minutes and 34. 1 to 56. 5 MLI panel purge volumes, respectively, for gaseous helium purge rates from 10 to 40 MLI panel volumes per hour...|$|R
40|$|This work {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} biomass composition (ash, volatile matter and fixed carbon content, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content, lignin, extractives and holocellulose content) on the <b>condensable</b> <b>gas</b> yield from the torrefaction of rice husk (Oryza sativa L.), jatropha seed husk (Jatropha curcas L.), elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum. var. mineiro); sugarcane bagasse (Sacharum officinarum L.) and bamboo (Bambusa vulgaris ex J. C. Wendl. var. vulgaris). Biomasses with a particle size between 0. 5 mm and 1. 0 mm were subjected to torrefaction process using a temperature gradient varying from 250 °C to 300 °C, for 15 min, with a heating rate of 20 °C min- 1. Five trials were conducted for each biomass and solid, liquid and gas yields were obtained. The holocellulose and the volatile matter content of biomass showed a positive and significant correlation with condensable yield. The ash content showed a negative and significant correlation with condensable yield. There was no significant correlation between the elementary chemical composition and the condensable yield...|$|R
