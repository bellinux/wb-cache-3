5|$|The Rage Against God (subtitle in US editions: How Atheism Led Me to Faith) is {{the fifth}} book by Peter Hitchens, first {{published}} in 2010. The book describes Hitchens's journey from atheism, far-left politics, and bohemianism, to Christianity and conservatism, detailing the influences on him {{that led to his}} conversion. The book is partly intended as a response to God Is <b>Not</b> <b>Great,</b> a book written by his brother Christopher Hitchens in 2007.|$|E
5|$|With her doctor's approval, Leigh {{was well}} enough to resume acting in 1946, {{starring}} in a successful London production of Thornton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth; but her films of this period, Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) and Anna Karenina (1948), were <b>not</b> <b>great</b> commercial successes. All British films in this period were adversely affected by a Hollywood boycott of British films.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Enrico Tortonese {{examined}} the Nice and Cayenne specimens of S. tudes (the Coromandel specimen having {{been lost in}} the interim) and concluded that they were <b>not</b> <b>great</b> hammerheads, but rather the same species as S. bigelowi. Carter Gilbert concurred in his 1967 revision of the hammerhead sharks, noting that while the lost Coromandel specimen was probably a great hammerhead, none of the existing material belonged to that species. Thus, Sphyrna tudes became the accepted name for the smalleye hammerhead, taking precedence over S. bigelowi because it was published earlier, and the great hammerhead received the next available name Sphyrna mokarran. Gilbert designated the Nice specimen as the lectotype that would define S. tudes, having priority over the Cayenne specimen (the paralectotype). This was meant to stabilize the name, but had the opposite effect.|$|E

5|$|In the east, Selvo {{not only}} {{maintained}} good {{trade relations with}} the Byzantine Empire, but also married into their royal family to consolidate the alliance that had existed for many years between the two nations. In 1075, Selvo married Teodora Ducas, daughter of Constantine X and sister of the reigning emperor, Michael VII. Though Venetians, especially the nobles, were wary of the pageantry that accompanied the marriage and the royal bride, the strengthened alliance meant even greater mobility for Venetian merchants in the east. Though {{the popularity of the}} new dogaressa was <b>not</b> <b>great,</b> Selvo was the hero of the merchant class that had had even greater political sway since the depositions of the Orseoli.|$|E
5|$|Kristin Lemmerman of CNN {{said that}} it is <b>not</b> <b>great</b> literature: 'Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the {{beginning}} contained too much recap to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.' Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally positive about the change of mood and development of characters. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Kristen Baldwin gave Goblet of Fire the grade of A-, praising the development of the characters as well as the many themes presented. However, she did worry that a shocking climax may be a nightmare factory for young readers.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maritime}} fur trade in Southern China by itself was probably <b>not</b> <b>great.</b> The Canton trade as a whole had limited effect on China, mostly limited to the tea growers of Fujian, the silk producers of Nanjing, the craftsmen of Canton, and various middlemen, and merchants. The ruling Manchus kept foreign trade by ship at bay. It was restricted to Canton, and even there was allowed only outside the city walls. China was generally self-sufficient. The main {{effect of the}} Old China Trade was an increased import of opium and related outflow of specie, which resulted in China being incorporated into the capitalist world system after 1830. However, the maritime fur trade played a minor role in this process.|$|E

5|$|The route {{was noted}} {{to appeal to}} many types of riders, be they climbers, sprinters, or time trialists. The race had seven flat stages which figured into end in mass sprints, and the hilly mixed stages were {{inviting}} for breakaways. Sastre, {{one of the first}} riders to announce he would ride the Giro, commented that the route was much harder than that of the 2009 Giro, and would demand a very strong climber to be its champion. Zomegnan concurred that the route favored climbers, noting that the distance spent time trialing was <b>not</b> <b>great</b> and that it would take errors from climbing specialists to allow a rider better suited for time trialing to be Giro champion.|$|E
