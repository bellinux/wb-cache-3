40|$|The <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> is {{emerging}} as a new level and type of health care. Increasing specialisation and advanced educational opportunities in nursing and the inequality in {{access to health care}} for sectors of the community have established the conditions under which the <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> movement has strengthened both nationally and internationally. The boundaries of responsibility for nurses are changing, not only because of increased demands but also because nurses have demonstrated their competence in varied extended and expanded practice roles. The <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> role reflects the continuing development of the nursing profession and substantially extends the career path for clinical nurses. This paper describes an aspect of a large-scale investigation into the feasibility {{of the role of the}} <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) health care system. The paper reports on the trial of practice for a wound care <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> model in a tertiary institution. In the trial the wound care <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> worked in an extended practice role for 10 months. The <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> practice was supported, monitored and mentored by a clinical support team.

40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} emergency <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> service effectiveness {{on outcomes}} related to {{quality of care}} and service responsiveness.

The rapid uptake of emergency <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> service in Australia has outpaced the capacity to evaluate this model in outcomes related to safety and quality of patient care. Design Pragmatic randomized controlled trial at one site with 260 participants. Methods This protocol describes a definitive prospective randomized controlled trial, which will examine the impact of emergency <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> service on key patient care and service indicators. The study control will be standard emergency department care. The intervention will be emergency <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> service.

Secondary outcome measures are waiting time, number of patients who did not wait, length of stay in the emergency department and representations within 48 hours. Discussion Scant research enquiry evaluating emergency <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> service on patient effectiveness and service responsiveness exists currently. This study is a unique trial that will test the effectiveness of the emergency <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioner</b> service on patients who present to the emergency department with pain.

After achieving board certification, the <b>nurse</b> <b>practitioners</b> must apply for additional credentials (e.g., APRN license, prescriptive authority, DEA registration number, etc.) at the state and federal level. The nurse practitioner must achieve a certain amount of continuing medical education (CME) credits and clinical practice hours in order to maintain certification and licensure.
