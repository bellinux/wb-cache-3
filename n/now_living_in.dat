5|$|In 1910, Weaver, <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Dubbo, contested {{the seat}} of Ashburnham for the Liberal Party but was {{defeated}} on 46-53% against the Labor Party's John Lynch. Undeterred, Weaver stood again in 1913 as the Farmers and Settlers Party candidate for {{the seat of}} Macquarie but was narrowly defeated with 49.61% against the Labor Party candidate's 50.39%. Weaver contested the result, accusing the Labor Party of manipulating the rolls. An inquiry found no fault in these accusations against the Labor Party, but instead found Weaver's own organisers guilty of roll-stuffing.|$|E
5|$|Priestley’s son, William, <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Philadelphia, was {{increasingly}} embarrassed by his father's actions. He confronted his father, expressing John and Benjamin Vaughan’s unease, his own wife's concerns about Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley's dietary care, {{and his own}} concerns at the closeness of Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley and Thomas Cooper's relationship, and their adverse influence on Dr Priestley; but this only led to a further estrangement between William and his sister-in-law. When, a while later, Priestley's household suffered a bout of food poisoning, perhaps from milk sickness or a bacterial infection, Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, falsely accused William of having poisoned the family's flour. Although this allegation has {{attracted the attention of}} some modern historians, it is believed to be without foundation.|$|E

5|$|The {{attention}} did {{not interfere}} with Gibbs' professional life, and he continued in his role at AGL. On 20 April 1929, at St Stephen's Church of England in Newtown, Gibbs wed Catherine Charlotte Coulson. Catherine died in November 1933 after little {{more than four years}} of marriage, and Gibbs remarried eighteen months later. His second wedding, to Rosamunde Marcelle Walker, occurred at St Stephen's on 20 April 1935, though the marriage was to end in divorce in the 1940s. On 9 February 1942 Gibbs, by <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Ashbury {{with his wife and two}} children, enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) at Paddington for service in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} a prologue {{during the summer of}} 2049 in a snowstorm. In a modern, broken-down grocery store, Nier fends off attacks from {{ethereal}} monsters to protect his sick young daughter, Yonah. After defeating the monsters, he checks on Yonah, who has begun to cough badly. The game then cuts to 1,312 years later, where Nier and Yonah are <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a village built upon the ruins of an old town. The low-technology village is one of several, and is surrounded by more modern ruins such as the remnants of train tracks and industrial machinery. The areas between towns are filled with monsters known as Shades that attack travelers.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Arthur Dales, <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a Florida trailer park, calls Mulder and Scully for help when a neighboring family disappears; and, with a hurricane approaching, Mulder and Scully find themselves trapped {{with a group of}} residents in a building where there is something in the water.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} more people with Scottish ancestry living abroad than the total {{population}} of Scotland. In the 2000 Census, 9.2million Americans self-reported some degree of Scottish descent. Ulster's Protestant population is mainly of lowland Scottish descent, and it is estimated that there are more than 27million descendants of the Scots-Irish migration <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the US. In Canada, the Scottish-Canadian community accounts for 4.7million people. About 20% of the original European settler population of New Zealand came from Scotland.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the Ice Age, with the loss of cold and dry {{conditions}} and the extinction of much of its prey, the Beringian wolf became extinct. The extinction of its prey has been attributed to the impact of climate change, competition with other species, including humans, or a combination of both factors. Local genetic populations were replaced by others from within the same species or of the same genus. Of the North American wolves, only the ancestor of the modern North American gray wolf survived. The remains of ancient wolves with similar skulls and dentition have been found in western Beringia (north-east Siberia). In 2016 a study showed that some of the wolves <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> remote corners of China and Mongolia share a common maternal ancestor with one 28,000-year-old eastern Beringian wolf specimen.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{returned}} to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen {{to win a}} place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, {{but at the same time}} suggested that he had offers from other Lancashire League teams to fall back on should he not be picked. There was also concern that, with his wife <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Scotland, he would breach the Australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with Test cricketers. In fact, lack of form and opportunity were greater threats to Barnes's continued Test career. Arriving back with several state games having already been played, he failed to make runs for New South Wales and was not picked for the first two Tests against the Indian tourists, Bill Brown taking over as opener with Morris.|$|E

5|$|Barnes went to England in the Australian {{winter of}} 1947. In his autobiography, {{he claimed to}} have gone as a {{representative}} for an alcohol company, although appears to have dealt in commodities that were in short supply due to rationing. Once in England, he was approached by Burnley to play as a professional in Lancashire League cricket, which he did briefly before becoming disinterested and resigning. Barnes returned to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen to win a place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, as the Australian authorities frowned on those who played professionally in England. There was also concern that, with his wife <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Scotland, he would breach the Australian Board of Control's rule that wives were not allowed to travel with players, by being in the same overseas country.|$|E
5|$|By <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Nelson and {{barred from}} the Inter-Colonial Tournament, Constantine played no {{first-class}} cricket for two years. His contract with Nelson made him unavailable {{for much of the}} 1933 West Indies' tour of England under Grant. Constantine never challenged Nelson over this; some critics suggested he was swayed by the greater financial rewards the club provided. He appeared once for the tourists in May, scoring 57 in 27 minutes and taking four wickets in a victory over an MCC team at Lord's. The West Indian board unsuccessfully tried to secure his release for the first Test match, which the West Indies lost heavily. After he took nine wickets in the tourists' game against Yorkshire, Nelson gave him permission to appear in the second Test at Manchester.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1945 Königsberg {{fell to the}} Red Army, and on 13 April Dietrich's SS {{unit was}} forced out of Vienna. The Battle of Berlin began at 03:30 on 16 April with a massive {{artillery}} barrage. Within the week, fighting was taking place inside the city. Among the many elements defending Berlin were French, Latvian, and Scandinavian Waffen-SS troops. Hitler, <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the Führerbunker under the Reich Chancellery, still hoped that his remaining SS soldiers could rescue the capital. In spite of the hopelessness of the situation, members of the SS patrolling the city continued to shoot or hang soldiers and civilians for what they considered to be acts of cowardice or defeatism. The Berlin garrison surrendered on 2 May, two days after Hitler committed suicide. As members of SS expected little mercy from the Red Army, they attempted to move westward to surrender to the western Allies instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} summer Whitman {{worked for}} another printer, Erastus Worthington, in Brooklyn. His family {{moved back to}} West Hills in the spring, but Whitman remained and {{took a job at}} the shop of Alden Spooner, editor of the leading Whig weekly newspaper the Long-Island Star. While at the Star, Whitman became a regular patron of the local library, joined a town debating society, began attending theater performances, and anonymously published some of his earliest poetry in the New-York Mirror. At age 16 in May 1835, Whitman left the Star and Brooklyn. He moved to New York City to work as a compositor though, in later years, Whitman could not remember where. He attempted to find further work but had difficulty, in part due to a severe fire in the printing and publishing district, and in part due to a general collapse in the economy leading up to the Panic of 1837. In May 1836, he rejoined his family, <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Hempstead, Long Island. Whitman taught intermittently at various schools until the spring of 1838, though he was not satisfied as a teacher.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris. The Memorize {{corporation}} has invented a new brain implant called Sensen, which enables 99% of the population to upload and share their memories on the net, as well as remove unhappy or unpleasant memories. This gives Memorize an immense degree of control over the population and enables them to establish a surveillance state, which leads a small group of rebels by the name of Errorists to attempt to bring down Memorize. The invention of the Sensen has also resulted in the creation of Leapers, memory-addicted humans who have absorbed so many memories that their Sensen has degraded and they have mutated into subhuman form, <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the sewers of Neo-Paris.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain, and coastal defences {{received}} little attention. Deal Castle was in a poor state of repair by 1615, the outer walls damaged by storms and coastal erosion, and a 1616 survey suggested that repairs estimated at £396 were necessary. The problems persisted, with the winter storms filling the moat with water and stones from the beach, and undermining the foundations; the castle's captain, William Byng, sent numerous complaints about this to his superiors. By 1634, surveys were suggesting that the repairs would now cost £1,243; a suggestion was put forward by the George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham, that nearby Camber Castle should be demolished to help provide materiel for the work at Deal. Most of the garrison were <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the town of Deal and complaints {{were made by the}} Lord Warden in 1618 that only a small guard force was being left to secure the castle at night. As the condition of the castle waned, fighting between Dutch, French and Spanish ships in the Downs became common. Some repairs were probably finally carried out in the late 1630s.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Pinocchio and Jiminy {{find the}} workshop vacant. They soon {{get a letter}} from the blue fairy as a dove, stating that Geppetto had ventured out in search of Pinocchio, but was swallowed by a giant sperm whale named Monstro, and is <b>now</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> his belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he is reunited with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale chases them, and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. They are all washed up on a beach on the other side. Geppetto and Jiminy survive, but Pinocchio lies motionless face down in a tide pool nearby. Back home, the group mourns him. The Blue Fairy, however, decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, that he is reborn as a real human boy (his donkey ears and tail also gone), and everyone celebrates. Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy, and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.|$|E
