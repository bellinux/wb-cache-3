5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} <b>National</b> <b>Parks,</b> Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there.

However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food in <b>National</b> <b>Parks.</b> Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E
