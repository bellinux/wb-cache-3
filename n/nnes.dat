40|$|BACKGROUND: Early {{excision}} is {{the only}} strategy to reduce melanoma mortality, but unnecessary excision of benign lesions increases morbidity and healthcare costs. OBJECTIVE: To assess accuracy in melanoma detection based on number-needed-to-excise (<b>NNE)</b> values over a 10 -year period. METHODS: Information was retrieved on all histopathologically confirmed cutaneous melanomas or melanocytic nevi that were excised between 1998 and 2007 at participating clinics. <b>NNE</b> values were calculated by dividing {{the total number of}} excised lesions by the number of melanomas. Analyses included changes in <b>NNE</b> over time, differences in <b>NNE</b> between specialized clinical settings (SCS) versus non-specialized clinical settings (NSCS), and patient factors influencing <b>NNE.</b> RESULTS: The participating clinics contributed a total of 300, 215 cases, including 17, 172 melanomas and 283, 043 melanocytic nevi. The overall <b>NNE</b> values achieved in SCS and NSCS in the 10 -year period were 8. 7 and 29. 4, respectively. The <b>NNE</b> improved over time in SCS (from 12. 8 to 6. 8), but appeared unchanged in NSCS. Most of the effect on <b>NNE</b> in SCS was due to a greater number of excised melanomas. Higher <b>NNE</b> values were observed in patients younger than 40 years and for lesions located on the trunk. LIMITATIONS: No data concerning the use of dermatoscopy and digital monitoring procedures were collected from the participating centers. CONCLUSION: Over the 10 -year study period, accuracy in melanoma detection improved only in specialized clinics maybe because of a larger use of new diagnostic techniques such as dermatoscop...|$|R

Follow-up {{interviews were conducted with}} voluntary participants (N= 9) to examine {{the perceptions of}} <b>NNES</b> graduate students towards <b>NNES</b> instructors in depth. The findings in the survey showed that more than one third of the participants experienced difficulty with their <b>NNES</b> instructors due to their limited intelligibility and restricted command of English. Furthermore, one third of the participants expressed that they would transfer to another section of a course if the <b>NNES</b> instructor of the course speaks highly accented English. However, the majority of them believed <b>NNES</b> instructors can be as effective as NNS instructors. More overtly negative views were found during the interviews; many of the interviewees revealed strong desire to avoid <b>NNES</b> instructors with particular language backgrounds.

40|$|Abstract Background. Previous {{research}} on written feedback {{has taken place}} mainly in campus-based settings. Written feedback to Non-Native English speaking Online Doctoral students is under-researched. Aim. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the attitudes, perceptions and actions of Non-Native English Speaking (<b>NNES)</b> Online Doctoral students toward the written feedback that they receive from their Native English Speaking (NES) doctoral research supervisors. This research will address questions about these students’ attitudes and perceptions regarding written feedback and the feedback providers. Furthermore, the investigation’s research findings point towards practical application by doctoral research supervisors. The Social Presence, Transactional Distance and Second Language Activity theories frame the interpretation of the findings. Sample. 100 online doctoral students completed the online survey of which 41 completed enough of the survey to be included in the study and 10 telephonic or Skype interviews were conducted. The survey respondents lived on different continents and represented seventeen distinct first languages, namely Afrikaans; Arabic; Chinese; Croatian; Dutch; French; German; Italian; Malay; Malayalam; Mandarin; Portuguese; Romanian; Russian; Spanish; Swedish; and Turkish. Method. A survey preceded and informed the 10 individual semi-structured interviews. An exploratory sequential, mixed methodological approach was used to develop an understanding of the main themes related to what <b>NNES</b> online doctoral students do with written feedback. Findings. This study focuses on the intersection of the online modality with the language issues encountered by <b>NNES</b> online doctoral students as opposed to campus-based <b>NNES</b> doctoral students or NES online doctoral students. The focus of this study is not a comparison between campus-based and online <b>NNES</b> and NES students but is intended to reflect upon issues that will promote the use of written feedback to improve the <b>NNES</b> online doctoral students learning experience. This study found that while <b>NNES</b> online doctoral students share many of the experiences of <b>NNES</b> campus-based students and NES online doctoral students, the combination of online and language issues compound the <b>NNES</b> online doctoral students’ ability to make good use of the written feedback that they receive. This combination of online and <b>NNES</b> has significant implications for policy, institutional guidance and practice.

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of film is becoming ever-more {{popular in the}} field of First Year College Writing Classes for NES and <b>NNES</b> students around the country. Many of the reasons for this are self-evident. Film frequently offers a strong emotional appeal to <b>NNES</b> students and more opportunities to access what may otherwise be linguistically inaccessible material (e. g., Stempleski, 1990; Kasper, 2000). In addition, film offers a pleasant alternative to the use of literature in a First Year Writing Class which can often intimidate or discourage many <b>NNES</b> students due to its linguistic complexity (McKay, 1982). What is less clear, however, is how film's inclusion may {{contribute to the development of}} academic writing skills in similar or different ways from print texts, such as short stories, poems, and essays. Therefore, this dissertation will compare the benefits and challenges of using film and print texts in a First Year College Writing Class for <b>NNES</b> students. From data gathered from student essays, interviews, surveys, and field notes, the current study addresses the following research questions: (1. What linguistic and rhetorical features characterize the style of academic discourse NES and <b>NNES</b> students produce about films compared to print texts? (2. What challenges do <b>NNES</b> freshman composition students face writing academic essays about films compared to writing about print texts? (3. What academic strategies do they say they use to try to overcome these challenges? Do any academic strategies correspond with particular linguistic and rhetorical features? (4. What are <b>NNES</b> students' opinions regarding watching and writing about films in a university composition class? Do students consider watching and writing about a film comparable as an academic activity to reading and writing about a print text? The study aims to contribute to the field of Second Language Writing literature by considering the impact of the choice of text form, either a movie or a print text, on <b>NNES</b> students' motivation and ability to write academic, college-level essays. Further, it will explore in what ways students' cultural, educational and linguistic backgrounds affect the ways they approach writing about a film and a print text. This knowledge should be especially helpful for Writing Program Administrators and First Year College Writing Teachers for <b>NNES</b> students. It should be noted that, as a result of this dissertation's findings, the researcher has changed his approach toward the use of film in a First Year College Writing class for <b>NNES</b> students.

This study explored the issue of whether preservice teachers are prepared to accept and validate diversity among their instructors which in turn should make them sensitive to diverse learners they will encounter in their future teaching. In {{the first part of the}} study, a total of 262 preservice teachers were surveyed. The survey data were collected in spring 2007 and fall 2008. Of the 262 preservice teachers, 20 participated in focus group discussions to provide further insight on their views of NES and <b>NNES</b> GTAs. In the second part of the study, four GTAs participated in a longitudinal study by writing online blog entries after any encounters (positive or negative) they had with their students inside and outside the classroom. The blogs reflected the GTAs? immediate reactions after their classes. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the GTAs. Findings of the first study revealed that preservice teacher perceived NES and <b>NNES</b> GTAs differently. Preservice teachers put a lot of emphasis on the intelligibility of the <b>NNES</b> GTAs. The preservice teachers were ?tolerant? if their <b>NNES</b> spoke English ?clearly?. However, there were some preservice teachers who were dissatisfied with their <b>NNES</b> GTAs due to their possessing a non-mainstream language. Findings of the second study revealed that <b>NNES</b> GTAs faced major challenges in their effort to be recognized as legitimate and competent instructors. Although the GTAs had vastly different personal backgrounds, perceptions, and identities as instructors, common themes or issues emerged from the data: (1) teaching is complex (linguistic, cultural, and racial issues are involved); (2) beliefs about teaching can change; (3) challenges are faced as an ?outsider? instructor; and (4) teaching provides experiences of joy.

Multiple studies attest to the disadvantages perceived and encountered by <b>NNES</b> (non-native English speaking) scholars as a result; yet, {{only a limited number}} have addressed the ‘gatekeeper’ side of the editorial process, with an exclusive focus on publication within social science journals (Belcher, 2007; Flowerdew, 2001). Recent evidence, highlighting significant disciplinary differences in publication practices (Gnutzmann and Rabe, 2014), points towards a lack of knowledge of editorial practices and perceptions of <b>NNES</b> scholars’ submissions in the ‘hard sciences’. This dissertation presents the results of an interview case study with the editors of a top-ranked, international chemistry journal. The purpose was to find out how these editors assess and perceive the role of language in the scientific editorial process and to gain insight into how to enhance the chances of successful publication by <b>NNES</b> authors. Analysis of the data suggests that language assessment is based on overall comprehension instead of quality, with a clear precedence given to the value of the scientific content over {{the way in which it}} is linguistically presented. Moreover, the results highlight the incidence of problematic linguistic errors and unfamiliarity with academic discourse from both NES (native English speaking) and <b>NNES</b> scholars. Recommendations include the need for <b>NNES</b> authors working in the ‘hard science’ disciplines to pay more specific attention to clear and comprehensible language in order to achieve success in publishing...|$|E

Guided by a social constructionist methodology, this study approached group work interaction from both a U. S. and <b>NNES</b> college student perspective. Intensive interview data were gathered and analysed by employing constructivist grounded theory strategies, which exposed behaviours and processes participants reported using in groups. Discourse {{analysis was used to}} gain a deeper understanding of what participants tried to achieve with their language. The findings confirm that multicultural interaction is extremely complex and changeable and poses difficult but different interpersonal problems for both parties, though <b>NNES</b> students are more profoundly affected. Analyses suggest that students used a discourse of difference to position themselves and others. In the discourse, U. S. student group work conduct was used as the standard against which <b>NNES</b> student behaviour was measured. The discourse favoured U. S. students and disturbed power circulation accordingly. Positioning acts and story lines anchored in the discourse seemed to be part of changeable substructures, specific to the individual and the situation. The substructures, consisting of needs and expectations, formed the local moral order that determined participants' rights and duties. Positioning involved complicated decisions about whether individuals should take social risks, leave comfort zones, reposition themselves, revise story lines, perform emotion work, or change ideas and expectations. Consequences of decisions were group inclusion or exclusion, becoming visible or invisible in class, and learning or not learning from group encounters. Trying to alleviate U.
