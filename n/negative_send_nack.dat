The server returns the requested packet (REP packet), over RTP, to the user terminal. In case of multicast-based services, the RTP retransmission procedure is more complex: while the media stream is multicast, the repair stream could be either multicast or unicast. In the unicast recovering procedure, the user terminal detects a packet loss, and it transmits a NACK, whose response is a unicast RET packet.|$|R

Such a Negative Acknowledgment (NACK) may trigger the receiving router to forward the Interest to other interfaces to explore alternate paths. The PIT state enables routers to identify and discard looping packets, allowing them to freely use multiple paths toward the same data producer. Packets cannot loop in NDN, which means {{there is no need}} for time-to-live and other measures implemented in IP and related protocols to address these issues.|$|R

This mechanism requires that terminals wait a minimum time between packet loss detection and <b>NACK</b> <b>sending.</b>|$|R

30|$|For {{the first}} issue, network coding has been {{introduced}} in multicast retransmission to improve retransmission robustness and efficiency in a wireless network [6]. In the network coding-based retransmission, each receiver <b>sends</b> a <b>NACK</b> message through the feedback channel {{if it does not}} correctly receive a packet. When it receives a NACK, however, the sender does not immediately retransmit the lost packet. Instead, the sender maintains a list of the lost packets and their corresponding receivers. During the retransmission phase, the sender forms a new packet by XOR operation over a set of the lost packets. It has been revealed through intensive work that significant bandwidth efficiency improvements can be achieved by retransmission with XOR-based network coding [6]. In this particular scheme, however, the feedback channel overhead problem still remains, as the feedback information is required {{to keep track of the}} individual lost packet.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we first}} {{consider}} a fading MAC (F-MAC) without security constraint. We assume each user knows only its individual channel gain (unlike [8], {{we do not}} assume that it knows the distributions of channel gains of others). Since the receiver is receiving data from all the users, it is quite practical {{to assume that the}} receiver has channel state information of all the transmitting users. Once a user sends a codeword corresponding to a particular message, the receiver sends an ACK if it decodes it successfully, else it <b>sends</b> a <b>NACK.</b> Each user computes a utility based on the ACK/NACK. We use multiplicative weight no-regret algorithm to obtain a coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE). We also assume in the later part of the paper that each user can decode ACK/NACK of other users and hence knows their utility. Then we aim to maximize the sum utility and propose an algorithm to obtain a Pareto point (PP). We also find a Nash bargaining solution (NBS) which provides a Pareto point and ensures fairness among users. We also study the case where users can transmit at multiple rates rather than fixed rates.|$|R

3000|$|..., a new encoded packet is {{generated}} in a rateless fashion. At the receiver, immediately after {{a sufficient number}} of the linearly independent coded packets have been received for a set of packets, the receiver can recover the source message. The source message of M packets can be recovered if and only if the number of error-free encoded packets is larger than or equal to M. If the number of received packets is not enough to decode the set of packets, the receiver <b>sends</b> an <b>NACK</b> message back to the sender over a feedback channel until the set of packets is successfully decoded. The advantage of RNC is that the sender does not have to know which packet is lost at which receiver. In other words, detailed feedback may not need to be implemented, unlike the XOR-based network coding. This leads to the design of a common feedback channel, which can be shared among all receivers in the system. Due to its shared nature, the feedback overhead is independent of the number of receivers. In RNC-based multicast transmission, the sender keeps transmitting coded packets until no feedback signal is detected over the common feedback channel. Upon receiving no feedback from all receivers, the sender proceeds to process the next set of packets.|$|R
40|$|When a {{wireless}} base station needs to transfer a data block to a large multicast group in a reliable way, a hybrid FEC/ARQ-based protocol is usually the best solution. For a large mul-ticast group, having each bad receiver <b>send</b> a <b>NACK</b> to the base station {{would result in a}} feedback implosion. In this pa-per we present an algorithm for estimating the number of bad receivers while limiting the number of NACKs. This algo-rithm analyzes the NACK transmission times, defines a like-lihood function for them, and then uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the number of bad receivers for which this function is maximized. We then analyze the precision of the proposed algorithm, and provide tight upper and lower bounds to the estimation error. These bounds indicate a lin-ear correlation between the estimation error and the number of NACKs. But even more important, they allow us to cor-rect the precision of our estimation, and to bring the error very close to 0. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to explicitly show the correlation between the num-ber of NACKs sent by a group and the ability of the sender to estimate the size of this group precisely. 1...|$|R

Initially we assume that each user knows only its own channel gain to the receiver and to the eavesdropper. When any user transmits a message, the receiver send an ACK if the message is decoded correctly and confidentially, else it <b>sends</b> a <b>NACK.</b> We use Multiplicative Weight no-regret algorithm to obtain a coarse correlated equilibrium. Next we maximize the weighted sum of utility of all the users and obtain Pareto optimal points. Since not all Pareto points are fair, we also obtain Nash Bargaining (NB) solutions which ensure certain fairness to all the users. In the next part of the paper we make more realistic assumption that each user knows only its own channel gain, and is ignorant of the channel gain to Eve (only its distribution is known). We use secrecy outage as the metric at the receiver to decide weather the message is correctly decoded or not. We obtain a coarse correlated equilibrium, a Pareto point and a Nash bargaining solution...|$|R

30|$|To reduce {{unnecessary}} redundant packet transmission, a {{feedback channel}} is {{introduced to the}} uplink channel.

However, this would incur enormous signaling overhead in the uplink when a dedicated feedback channel resource is allocated to an individual user. Instead, a common feedback channel can be employed for NACK feedback information from all users, as discussed in Section 2.1. In the common feedback channel, all users <b>send</b> an identical <b>NACK</b> signal through the common uplink channel resource without carrying the users’ identifications. In the implementation, the base station may reserve a radio resource unit as a common feedback channel.
