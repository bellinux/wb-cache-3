5000|$|Recent {{developments}} that permit <b>non-invasive</b> <b>monitoring</b> using functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD) technique showed that successful problem-solving employs a discrete knowledge strategy (DKS) that selects neural pathways represented in one hemisphere, while unsuccessful outcome implicates a non-discrete knowledge strategy (nDKS). A polygraphic test {{could be viewed}} as a working memory task. This suggests that the DKS model may have a correlate in mnemonic operations. In other words, the DKS model may have a discrete knowledge base (DKB) of essential components needed for task resolution, while for nDKS, DKB is absent and, hence, a [...] "global" [...] or bi-hemispheric search occurs. Based on the latter premise, a 'lie detector' system was designed as described in [...] A pattern of blood-flow-velocity changes is obtained in response to questions that include correct and incorrect answers. The wrong answer will elicit bi-hemispheric activation, from correct answer that activates unilateral response. Cognitive polygraphy based on this system is devoid of any subjective control of mental processes and, hence, high reliability and specificity; however, this is yet to be tested in forensic practice.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{assessment}} of hemodynamic status {{is a crucial}} task in the initial evaluation of trauma patients. However, blood pressure and heart rate are often misleading, as multiple variables may impact these conventional parameters. More reliable methods such as pulmonary artery thermodilution for cardiac output measuring would be necessary, but its applicability in the Emergency Department is questionable due to their invasive nature. <b>Non-invasive</b> cardiac output <b>monitoring</b> devices may be a feasible alternative. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted. Only studies that explicitly investigated <b>non-invasive</b> hemodynamic <b>monitoring</b> devices in trauma patients were considered. RESULTS A total of 7 studies were identified as suitable and were included into this review. These studies evaluated {{in a total of}} 1, 197 trauma patients the accuracy of <b>non-invasive</b> hemodynamic <b>monitoring</b> devices by comparing measurements to pulmonary artery thermodilution, which is the gold standard for cardiac output measuring. The correlation coefficients r between the two methods ranged from 0. 79 to 0. 92. Bias and precision analysis ranged from - 0. 02 +/- 0. 78 l/min/m(2) to - 0. 14 +/- 0. 73 l/min/m(2). Additionally, data on practicality, limitations and clinical impact of the devices were collected. CONCLUSION The accuracy of <b>non-invasive</b> cardiac output <b>monitoring</b> devices in trauma patients is broadly satisfactory. As the devices can be applied very early in the shock room or even preclinically, hemodynamic shock may be recognized much earlier and therapeutic interventions could be applied more rapidly and more adequately. The devices can be used in the daily routine of a busy ED, as they are non-invasive and easy to master...|$|R
