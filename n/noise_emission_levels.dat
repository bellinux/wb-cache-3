The inaugural awards were presented in 2009 and recipients included Pratt & Whitney and Domtar Paper Company for the manufacturing sector, Montgomery County Water Services (Ohio) for the services sector, and Sensaphonics Hearing Conservation, Inc. for innovation. Several of the award recipients have reported that noise control is a cost-effective primary preventive strategy, and that their results encouraged them to expand the adoption and implementation of noise control alternatives.

The Golmohammadi, et al (2007) equation was used to estimate noise level from motor vehicles wherein four groups of variables were considered: road dimension parameters, traffic flow, vehicle speed and <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> of four groups of vehicles. The predicted noise values from the model were compared with those measured in the field. Predicted average <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> were found to compare favorably with measured values. In general, the measurements and the model results indicated that the highest noise levels were found to occur close to the road. It was also observed that there is a decrease in noise levels as the distance from the road increases. Using the same equation, the <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> along A.

The distances from the road of 75 dB, 65 dB and 60 dB noise level were also calculated using the sound propagation equation. The number of buildings, most especially those classified as noise sensitive receptors, were also determined. The estimated noise levels and the number of noise sensitive buildings were presented in a map using ArcView GIS.

While underwater noise levels were shown to be harmful for the marine biology, the propagation of airborne piling noise over sea has not been studied in detail before. In this study, detailed numerical calculations have been performed with the Green's Function Parabolic Equation (GFPE) method to estimate noise levels up to a distance of 10 km. Measured <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> during piling of pinpiles for a jacket-foundation wind turbine were assessed and used together with combinations of the sea surface state and idealized vertical sound speed profiles (downwind sound propagation). Effective impedances were found and used to represent non-flat sea surfaces at low-wind sea states 2, 3, and 4. Calculations show that scattering by a rough sea surface, which decreases sound pressure levels, exceeds refractive effects, which increase sound pressure levels under downwind conditions. This suggests that the presence of wind, even when blowing downwind to potential receivers, is beneficial to increase the attenuation of piling sound over the sea. A fully flat sea surface therefore represents a worst-case scenario...|$|E

This paper investigates the effects of traffic condition, distance to road and background landscape on the perceived integrated impact of noise and visual intrusion of motorways, and explores if noise exposure {{can be a powerful}} indicator for the perceived integrated impact. Six traffic conditions, consisting of three <b>levels</b> of <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> × two <b>levels</b> of heavy good vehicle percentage in traffic composition, two types of background landscape and three distances to road, were designed as experimental scenarios, and created using computer visualisation and edited audio recordings.

40|$|Swedish EPA (Naturvårdsverket) {{noise level}} guide-lines suggest that {{equivalent}} A-weighted sound pressure levels (SPL)  must not exceed 40 dBA at residents. Thus, {{in the planning}} of new wind farms and their location {{it is crucial to}} estimate the disturbance it may cause to nearby residents. Wind turbine <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> are guaranteed by the wind turbine manufacturer only under ice-free conditions. Thus, ice accretion on wind turbine may lead to increased wind turbine noise resulting in noise levels at nearby residents to exceed 40 dBA SPL. The purpose of the project is to evaluate the effect on wind turbine noise emission due to ice accretion. This, by trying to quantify the ice accretion on rotor blades and correlate it to any change in noise emission. A literature study shows that the rotor blades are to be considered the primary noise source. Hence, ice accretion on rotor blades are assumed to be the main influence on noise character. A field study is performed in two parts; as a long term measurement based on the method out-lined by IEC 61400 - 11 and as a short term measurement in strict accordance with IEC 61400 - 11. These aim to obtain <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> <b>levels</b> for the case of icing conditions and ice-free conditions (reference conditions) as well as background noise levels. An analysis is performed, which sets out to correlate ice measurements with wind turbine performance and noise emission. Data reduction procedures are performed according to IEC 61400 - 11. The apparent sound power levels are evaluated. This is performed for the case of icing conditions {{as well as for the}} case of ice-free onditions. A statistical evaluation of icing event is carried out. The results show that ice accretion on wind turbine (rotor blades) may lead to drastically higher <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> <b>levels.</b> The sound power levels show an average increase of 10. 6 dB at 8 m/s. However, this can occur at all wind speeds from 6 m/s to 10 m/s. Higher levels of noise, (55 to 65 dBA SPL) may be caused by very small amounts of ice accretion. Occurrences of higher levels of noise, in the range of 50 to 65 dBA SPL, are not common. Noise levels exceeding 50 dBA SPL are to expected 10. 3 % of the time during the winter or 3 % of the time during one year. Correlation between measured ice accumulation and noise level is weak apart from large amounts of ice. This due to statistical noise. Taking into account the noise level guide-lines of 40 dBA SPL at residents, as is recommended by Swedish EPA (Naturvårdsverket), the increased levels of windturbine noise under icing conditions may force the power production to a halt...|$|E

To detect an existing double sided defective hearing, the area around 4 kHz was scanned. Results: The measurement of the working stations showed that there are no defective hearing causing levels are reached. Questionable are partially high impulse levels, wich are in fact below the damage threshold but worth to be surveyed, because the exccedance on other non measuring days seems to be possible. The evaluation of the audiograms shows that after a period of 15 years of noise exposition an defective hearing happened. The comparison of the <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> <b>level</b> with the caused damages after a minimum of 15 years of exposition shows that it is highly probable that a change of the working circumstances happened. In addition it was discovered that the general noise level was to high for work that needs such a high level of mental concentration. Results: A defective hearing is at the moment and under this working circumstances not possible but basically changes in the technical equipment should be done so that these are definitely avoided for the future. Specific electronic cicuits mount at the radios can provide this. Changes of the technical structure {{in the area of the}} working stations are recommended to reduce the sound levels wich are in the present, still to high for such a kind of work where a high level of mental concentration is necessary...|$|R
