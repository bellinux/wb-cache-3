Throughout the broadcast, Nielsen and his co-star from The Naked Gun, George Kennedy, appeared backstage in skits {{trying to solve the}} mystery of the two Undertakers.|$|E

25|$|The Sims Bustin' Out is {{the second}} title in The Sims console series. Bustin' Out was {{released}} for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and N-Gage {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2003. As the title suggests, Sims can get out of the house to visit other locations such as Shiny Things Lab or Casa Caliente. There are two modes. Bust Out Mode which has mission based gameplay and Freeplay Mode which is open-ended gameplay very much like the original The Sims PC game. It was the second Sims game to <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PC; it was a follow up to The Sims, which was very similar to Bustin' Out, except the aims were shifted to getting job promotions and constantly fulfilling goals to get ahead in the game. The PlayStation 2 version also features the option to play online, though EA no longer supports it.|$|E
25|$|On August 6, 2010, the CBC {{issued a}} press release stating that due to {{financial}} reasons, the CBC and Radio-Canada would only transition 27 transmitters total, one in each market where there was an originating station (i.e. a CBC or Radio-Canada television station located in that market). Further, the CBC stated in the release, that only 15 of the transmitters would be in place by August 31, 2011 {{due to lack of}} available funds, and that the remainder would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air until as late as August 31, 2012. Additionally, the CBC stated in the release that it was asking the CRTC for permission to continue broadcasting in analogue until the identified transmitters for transition were up and running. At the time of the press release, only eight of the corporation's transmitters (four CBC and four Radio Canada) were broadcasting in digital.|$|E

50|$|At the Amsterdam Olympics, {{her third}} 100 m competition, Robinson reached the final and won, equalling the world record. She was the inaugural Olympic {{champion}} in the event, since athletics for women had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> program before, and its inclusion was in fact still heavily disputed among officials. With the American 4×100 meters relay team, Robinson added a silver medal to her record.|$|R
25|$|On July 16, 2008, the California Supreme Court {{denied a}} {{petition}} {{calling for the}} removal of Proposition 8 from the November ballot. The petition asserted the proposition should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballot on the grounds it was a constitutional revision that only the Legislature or a constitutional convention could place before voters. Opponents also argued that the petitions circulated to qualify the measure for the ballot inaccurately summarized its effect. The court denied the petition without comment. As a general rule, it is improper for courts to adjudicate pre-election challenges to a measure's substantive validity. The question of whether Proposition 8 is a constitutional amendment or constitutional revision was ruled on by the California Supreme Court on May 26, 2009, and found {{that it was not a}} revision and therefore would be upheld. They also declared that the same-sex marriages performed prior to the passing of Prop 8 would remain valid.|$|E
500|$|Khloé married {{basketball}} player Lamar Odom during a fourth-season premiere aired in 2009. He later {{had a major}} role {{as part of the}} supporting cast of the series, though he did not appear regularly during the following seasons as he was attempting to repair his marriage with Khloé. Kim's current husband Kanye West made his first appearance on Keeping Up with the Kardashians in July 2012 during the seventh season when he started dating Kim. However, West was seldom seen in subsequent seasons. He explained the reasons for not appearing on the show later: [...] "You know, the amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show anymore. And it's not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get." [...] He also criticized the show for its cinematography and further complained about the way how the show is filmed. In the eighth season, Caitlyn Jenner's sons Brandon and Brody Jenner, as well as Brandon's wife Leah, joined the cast for regular appearances.|$|E
500|$|Early in the 2010 {{legislative}} session, Beshear {{presented his}} biennial budget {{proposal to the}} General Assembly. The state projected a $1.5 billion shortfall for the biennium, and Beshear once again proposed {{to make up for}} the shortfall with revenue generated from expanded gambling. Days after Beshear presented the proposal, both House Speaker Stumbo and Senate President Williams declared all gambling legislation [...] "dead" [...] for the session, saying there was no political will in either chamber to pass such legislation ahead of the legislative elections in November. The process of crafting a budget consumed the vast majority of the Assembly's time during the session, but legislators reached the constitutionally mandated end of their session with no agreement. Announcing his intent to call a special session to pass a budget and prevent a state government shutdown, Beshear blasted the leadership of both chambers for discarding his budget proposal. [...] "riting their own budget would be their 'defining moment'," [...] Beshear said the legislators had claimed. [...] "Well, it was. A moment of abject failure." [...] Beshear said expanded gambling would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> agenda for the special session unless an agreement were reached before the session date. In May 2010, legislators reconvened and passed a budget. Beshear utilized his line-item veto on 19 items in the budget, claiming they restricted his ability to implement the reduction in executive expenses mandated by the budget. Legislators were unable to override the vetoes because the special session had already adjourned.|$|E

500|$|Kevin Tancharoen {{was chosen}} as the tour director. He said about the {{development}} of the tour, [...] "Coming from a movie lovers' background, I wanted to make it seem like a film. A little Joel Schumacher meets Tim Burton". He further explained that the onyx stone symbolized untapped desire. The stage was less elaborate than her previous tour, Dream Within a Dream Tour, with no runway extended towards the audience, {{in order to keep the}} show faithful to the New York theatre theme. There were three video screens above the stage. Also present were several LED columned-shaped video screens in the stage. The setlist was mostly composed from songs from In the Zone ("Early Mornin'" [...] and [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] being the only songs of the album to <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tour). Other songs included were [...] "Boys", [...] "I'm A Slave 4 U,"and [...] "Overprotected" [...] from Britney (2001). Also included were three of her early hits, [...] "...Baby One More Time", (You Drive Me) Crazy and [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", reworked with elements of jazz and blues. The promotional photos for the tour were by Markus Klinko and Indrani. Tour promoter Clear Channel Entertainment marketed the tour to an entirely different demographic than her previous tours, changing from families and children to a more adult audience. The show was also targeted to the gay market. Promotional campaigns included were Flash animated e-mails targeted to two million people who fitted the audience description. The tour was also advertised in several radio stations and TV shows for those audiences, such as The O.C. MTV {{was chosen as}} the tour sponsor. The sponsorship was extended to advertisements in the tickets and interactive promotions in MTV.com, such as exclusive downloads, streaming video and ticket and merchandise auctions benefiting the Britney Spears Foundation. Three episodes of TRL were dedicated to a behind-the-scenes special. Vice president of music marketing and promotion Joe Armenia talked about the sponsorship, ...|$|E

By the time the policy changed in late 1998, [...] "Torn" [...] was heading down the charts, so its peak on the Hot 100 ended at 42.

2500|$|On June 25, 2003, Marty Ingels, a voice actor, {{called into}} Leykis's show {{and tried to}} {{challenge}} him on moral grounds. Ingels, who was much older than the typical caller to Leykis's show, was subjected to some rude remarks by the call screener {{who said that he}} was too old and should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air. But Ingels was placed on the air, and Leykis also disparaged Ingels, stating [...] "you're not just older than my demographic, you're the grandfather of my demographic". Leykis explained that he didn't want older callers because he was selling advertising aimed at younger listeners. Ingels sued the show for age discrimination. Ingels's first lawsuit got dismissed by an anti-SLAPP statute (...) that protected against lawsuits that protects First Amendment rights and another judge claimed that the show had the right to control its content. Further, it was noted that Ingels could not really complain he was discriminated against because his call was in fact put on the air. As for Ingels, the actor was ordered to pay $25,000 in attorney's fees to Leykis.|$|E
