25|$|It is {{sometimes}} claimed that as {{with some other}} seabirds (e.g. the flightless Plotopteridae), the evolutionary radiation of cetaceans and pinnipeds outcompeted the pseudotooth birds and drove them into extinction. While this may be correct for the plotopterids, for pelagornithids it is not all too likely for two reasons: First, the Pelagornithidae continued to thrive for 10 million years after modern-type baleen whales evolved, and in the Middle Miocene Pelagornis coexisted with Aglaocetus and Harrison's whale (Eobalaenoptera harrisoni) in the Atlantic off the Eastern Seaboard, while the Pacific Osteodontornis inhabited the same seas as Balaenula and Morenocetus; the ancestral smallish sperm whale genus Aulophyseter (and/or Orycterocetus) occurred in both Northern Hemisphere oceans at that time, while the mid-sized sperm whale Brygmophyseter roamed the North Pacific. As regards Miocene pinnipeds, a diversity of ancient walruses and ancestral fur seals like Thalassoleon inhabited the north-east, while the ancient leopard seal Acrophoca is a remarkable species known from the south-east Pacific. Secondly, pinnipeds are limited to <b>near-shore</b> <b>waters</b> while pseudotooth birds roamed the seas far and wide, like large cetaceans, and like all big carnivores all three groups were K-strategists with moderate to very low population densities.|$|E
500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the leopard shark as of Least Concern. It is highly susceptible to local depletion {{due to its}} slow growth rate and low level of exchange between regional stocks. It was considered for, but is not managed under, the U.S. Pacific Fishery Management Council's (PMC) 1982 Groundfish Management Plan. In 1992, the State of California imposed a recreational minimum size limit of [...] and a possession limit of three fish, a move that was strongly supported and promoted by the sport fishing community. In 1993, the State also instituted a minimum size limit of [...] for the commercial harvesting of all sharks and rays, including for the aquarium trade. In addition, Californian restrictions {{on the use of}} certain types of fishing gear in <b>near-shore</b> <b>waters</b> confer good protection to this shark's core population. These management measures seem to have successfully reduced fishing mortality and halted the population decline from the 1980s; the status of the leopard shark off California is regarded as secure, with demographic models estimating an annual population increase of 3ndash&6% with sustainable fishing.|$|E
500|$|Spearfishing with barbed {{harpoons}} {{along the}} sea coast was widespread by the Palaeolithic. Fish ponds surrounded Sumerian temples by 2500 BC and a Chinese classical text credited to the 5th-century BC businessman Fan Li is {{the earliest known}} work on fish farming. A surviving fragment of Isidore of Charax's 1st-century Parthian itinerary describes locals freediving for pearls in the Persian Gulf, and Oppian's 2nd-century Halieutics relates the four main Greek and Roman fishing methods as hook-and-line, netting, passive traps, and trident. Traditional fishing boats operate in <b>near-shore</b> <b>waters</b> but, during the late Middle Ages and early Modern period, fishing on the open sea—particularly cod—became important to the economic and naval development of Northern Europe, New England, and Canada. Overfishing along the coasts of the North Sea spurred the development of deep-sea fishers such as the Brixham and otter trawlers, which might serve as motherships for longlining dories; in the 19th century, advances such as rail transport, canning, and refrigeration allowed fishing to become a full-fledged industry. Improvements in sonar during the world wars were adapted as fishfinders and, during the 1950s, great factory ships caught and processed as many fish in an hour as earlier trawlers had in a season. By the 1960s, the North Atlantic and North Pacific fisheries were close to maximal exploitation. After the catch from wild marine fisheries grew from 18 million metric tons (20 million tons) in 1950 to around 85 million metric tons ( [...] million tons) by the late 1980s, it has remained essentially constant since. Chinese economic reform led to massive growth of its fishing production, from 7% of the world total in 1961 to 35% by 2010. Scientific studies of population dynamics and nationalization of formerly shared waters are both helping to cope with overexploitation but the success of modern commercial fishing has required major corrective actions: {{the collapse of the}} Grand Banks cod fishery to less than 1% of its historic levels required a complete moratorium by Canada in 1992 and China has enforced a zero-growth policy in its wild catch since 2000, redirecting its industry towards aquaculture; its annual months-long bans on fishing in disputed areas of the South China Sea is enforced over the protest of neighboring states.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 As shorelines develop, {{wastewater}} infrastructure {{systems are}} designed to simultaneously support urban development and protect human and ecosystem health from sewage contamination. The ability to effectively manage coastlines in an urban setting depends on understanding the interactions between human and biophysical systems, and to incorporate that information into policy and planning decisions that support regional water quality goals. Past research has linked the contamination of coastal and estuarine ecosystems to upland land use, as well as centralized and decentralized wastewater systems. Missing from this research is an evaluation of how urban development relates to alternative wastewater infrastructures and the links between coastal water quality, wastewater infrastructure and patterns of urbanization. My research sought to systematically assess alternative wastewater infrastructures across an urban gradient and to assess the relationships between wastewater disposal type, land use-cover pattern, and <b>near-shore</b> <b>water</b> quality. I evaluate the spatial characteristics of parcels with sewers vs. onsite septics in sub-watersheds and link wastewater type to urban patterns to answer two questions: (1) How are alternative wastewater infrastructures spatially distributed across an urban gradient? (2) How do different wastewater infrastructures relate to land-use and land-cover patterns? At a larger landscape-scale, I relate indicators of <b>near-shore</b> <b>water</b> quality to wastewater infrastructure and land use-land cover patterns to address a third question: (3) How does <b>near-shore</b> <b>water</b> quality relate to wastewater infrastructure and urban development patterns? This research relies on a three-part approach that uses quantitative measures of wastewater patterns, landscape characteristics, and microbial conditions for shellfish growing areas. To answer the first question, I quantify and compare spatial measures of parcels on two types of wastewater systems. I address the second question by relating land-use and land-cover pattern (composition and configuration) to wastewater type (septic vs. sewer). I answer the third question by combining spatial information about land-use, land-cover and wastewater in near-shore basins to assess how these factors influence water quality in shellfish growing areas. The results from the study in the Puget Sound support previous findings that suburban sub-basins with moderate amounts of development contain significantly higher counts and densities of residential parcels with onsite-septics than urban or rural counterparts. However, I did not find septic density {{to be a significant}} predictor of fecal coliform (FC) in shellfish growing areas; the number of septics was only moderately related to FC. The total amount of high intensity urban land cover was the single best predictor of <b>near-shore</b> <b>water</b> quality. I found significant associations between wastewater treatment type and the composition and configuration of land cover. On average, Puget Sound basins with 20 % of their area or more covered by high urban land cover {{are more likely to be}} dominated by parcels on a sewer system...|$|R

50|$|If {{there are}} any {{particles}} suspended in the water, they will increase the scattering of light.

For example, microscopic marine algae, called phytoplankton, have the capacity to absorb light in the blue and red region of the spectrum owing to specific pigments like chlorophyll. Accordingly, as the concentration of phytoplankton increases in the water, the color of the water shifts toward the green part of the spectrum. Fine mineral particles like sediment absorb light in the blue part of the spectrum, causing the water to turn brownish in case of massive sediment load.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we used 454 -pyrosequencing {{to report}} the highly diverse diazotroph {{communities}} in the Kuroshio and its adjacent waters along a transect across the Tokara Strait, Japan. Terrestrial input from the islands resulted in a highly heterogeneous diazotroph community within a relatively small geographic region, which was presumably caused by the remarkably different responses of UCYN-A 2, UCYN-C and Trichodesmium to the steep environmental gradient. On the other hand, most major cyanobacterial OTUs {{found in this study}} were also detected in an unpublished dataset from the upstream Kuroshio, which suggests transportation of diazotrophs by the Kuroshio in large geographic scale.
