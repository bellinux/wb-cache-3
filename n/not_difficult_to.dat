5|$|The red wattlebird {{has been}} kept as an aviary bird in Sydney. It is <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> look after {{but can be}} very {{aggressive}} to other cage birds. Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' is a useful companion shrub as it bears flowers all year round.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{principal}} Upanishads {{can be associated with}} one of the schools of exegesis of the four Vedas (shakhas). Many Shakhas are said to have existed, of which only a few remain. The new Upanishads often have little relation to the Vedic corpus and have not been cited or commented upon by any great Vedanta philosopher: their language differs from that of the classic Upanishads, being less subtle and more formalized. As a result, they are <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> comprehend for the modern reader.|$|E
5|$|Public {{and artistic}} {{opinion of the}} new pieces was, and remains, mixed. In 1915, Mint {{officials}} began plans to replace them, after the design's minimum term expired in 1916. The Mint issued Barber dimes and quarters in 1916 to meet commercial demand, but {{before the end of}} the year, the Mercury dime, Standing Liberty quarter, and Walking Liberty half dollar had begun production. Most dates in the Barber coin series are <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> obtain, but the 1894 dime struck at the San Francisco Mint (1894-S), with a mintage of 24, is a great rarity.|$|E
40|$|Unbounded {{dependencies}} in Modern Standard Arabic often involve not a gap but a null resumptive pronoun. The {{facts are}} quite complex, {{but it is}} <b>not</b> too <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> extend the SLASH mechanism of HPSG to handle dependencies with a null resumptive pronoun. It is also <b>not</b> too <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> restrict the distribution of gaps appropriately...|$|R

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are more}} susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It is <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.|$|E
5|$|There were problems. Inflated bomb damage {{assessment}} reports during operations in northeastern Laos were common, but {{the cause was}} <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> discern. Mountainous terrain, poor weather, ground cover, the lack of ground forces for confirmation, and the language barrier all contributed to overestimation of the damage inflicted on communist forces by the bombing effort. The result was a skewed sense of the effectiveness and {{the capabilities of the}} campaign. The results of the campaign (which were made obvious by the repeating seasonal nature of PAVN and Pathet Lao offensives), however, indicated that American airpower was quite effective.|$|E
5|$|As an anointed queen, Mary {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the power of any court to try her and refused to attend the inquiry at York personally (she sent representatives), but Elizabeth forbade her attendance anyway. As evidence against Mary, Moray presented the so-called casket letters—eight unsigned letters purportedly from Mary to Bothwell, two marriage contracts, and a love sonnet or sonnets {{said to have been}} found in a silver-gilt casket just less than one foot (30cm) long, decorated with the monogram of King Francis II. Mary denied writing them, arguing that her handwriting was <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> imitate, and insisted they were forgeries. They are widely believed to be crucial as to whether Mary shares the guilt for Darnley's murder. The chair of the commission of inquiry, the Duke of Norfolk, described them as horrible letters and diverse fond ballads, and sent copies to Elizabeth, saying that if they were genuine they might prove Mary's guilt.|$|E

But it would again <b>not</b> be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Heart of Darkness in 1998, Chahi left the video games industry to explore other interests, and subsequently developed a passion for volcanology. In the past, Chahi self-produced video games, as the PC market was independent games-orientated. However, the independent game's importance diminished by 2006, so Chahi decided {{to work with a}} publisher instead. He presented the concept to Ubisoft in 2006. According to Chahi, it was <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> convince Ubisoft to fund the project, though initially there was hesitation and the proposal was rejected. After the company reversed its decision, the team spent approximately two years meeting with the key people within Ubisoft; development properly began in January 2008. The team initially only had three people, but it was expanded to about 15 to 20 people, which was considered a small team for Ubisoft.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept {{that there should be a}} large opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E
5|$|The {{main focus}} of the Exchequer was the {{collection}} of royal revenue {{as part of the}} greater Exchequer, which was officially undertaken by the Lord High Treasurer. The Exchequer was unique in having jurisdiction in matters of both equity and the common law, the latter initially curtailed after the Magna Carta and reserved for the Court of King's Bench and Court of Common Pleas, although it later grew back. This process of common law and equity was reversed; during the 16th century the Exchequer was solely a common law body, with the equity jurisdiction only again becoming relevant {{near the end of the}} Tudor period. W. H. Bryson argues that this happened during the reign of Edward I. By 1590 the Exchequer's jurisdiction over equity cases was confirmed, and it was handling a significant number a year, including disputes over trusts, mortgages, tithes and copyholds; since taxation was ever-present, it was <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> show that the dispute prevented the payment of a debt to the monarch, allowing the Writ of Quominus.|$|E

25|$|The {{seeds of}} other poppy types are not eaten, {{but they are}} {{cultivated}} for the flowers they produce. Annual and biennial poppies are considered a good choice to cultivate from seed as they are <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> propagate by this method, and can be put directly in the ground during January. The California poppy (Eschscholzia californica), for example, is a striking orange wildflower that grows in the Western and Northwestern United States.|$|E
25|$|The manor {{consisted}} of 10 messuages, 5 cottages, 10 gardens, 10 orchards, 500a. land, 50a meadow, 100a. pasture, 10a. wood, 100a. furze and heath, 50a. moor, 10a. water, 6s.4d. rent, turbary, fishing, etc. in Sierston and Flintham. Because William Fillingham had himself surveyed the estate {{as early as}} 1775 and had arranged to have estimates made of the improved value of Syerston if enclosed, with costs of enclosure, it is <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> guess his next move.|$|E
