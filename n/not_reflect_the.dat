5|$|Kou Yaginuma's initial {{inspiration}} for the story came from a statement he once read describing the Hohner Little Lady harmonica {{as one of the}} first musical instruments taken into space. However, as an aspiring manga artist, Yaginuma had neither resources to conduct research on nor knowledge pertaining to spaceflight. He also hesitated to write the series because his own life experiences did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> dreams of his characters. Despite these challenges, Yaginuma found comfort in the determination of his characters, especially that of Asumi Kamogawa.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} further {{promoted}} {{on her first}} headlining tour, The Virgin Tour, which only visited cities in the United States and Canada. Early on there were plans to schedule dates in England and Japan due to Madonna's large fan base in both countries. However, the final schedule did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> idea. In the end several more US dates were added and moved to larger concert venues due to overwhelmingly strong ticket sales.|$|E

The academic Jeremy Black points to the 1951 defections of two members of MI6—Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean—to the Soviet Union as having a major impact on how Britain was poorly viewed in US intelligence circles; Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but he did not focus on it too strongly, and Bond and Leiter's warm relationship did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> reality of the US-UK relationship.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to {{a small portion of}} the male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics.|$|E

David Suchet, whose {{portrayal}} of Poirot achieved fame through the popular television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, was hired to provide Poirot's voice. His performance was generally met with praise. Some have criticized the game for not allowing the player to actually control Poirot; the developers explained this choice by saying that adventure gamers who make mistakes throughout the game do <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> genius of Poirot, but are better represented by amateur sleuth Antoinette Marceau.|$|E

The plan {{of each of the}} four caves (1 to 4) includes an entrance with a verandah (mukha mandapa) supported by stone columns and brackets, a distinctive feature of these caves, leading to a columned mandapa, or main hall (also maha mandapa), and then to the small, square shrine (sanctum sanctorum, garbha ghriya) cut deep inside the cave.

The ASD classification is to some extent an artifact of how autism was discovered, and may <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> true nature of the spectrum; methodological problems have beset Asperger syndrome as a valid diagnosis from the outset. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E
5|$|The last opus {{number that}} Chopin himself used was 65, {{allocated}} to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At {{the request of the}} composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66–73), published in 1855. In 1857, 17 Polish songs that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> order of composition.|$|E
5|$|At La Brea, predatory {{birds and}} mammals were {{attracted}} to dead or dying herbivores that had become mired, and then these predators became trapped themselves. Herbivore entrapment was estimated to have occurred once every fifty years, and for every instance of herbivore remains found in the pits there were an estimated ten carnivores. C.d.guildayi {{is the most common}} carnivoran found at LaBrea, followed by Smilodon. Remains of dire wolves outnumber remains of gray wolves in the tar pits by a ratio of five to one. During the Last Glacial Maximum, coastal California, with a climate slightly cooler and wetter than today, is thought to have been a refuge, and a comparison of the frequency of dire wolves and other predator remains at LaBrea to other parts of California and North America indicates significantly greater abundances; therefore, the higher dire wolf numbers in the LaBrea region did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> wider area. Assuming that {{only a few of the}} carnivores that were feeding became trapped, it is likely that fairly sizeable groups of dire wolves fed together on these occasions.|$|E

5|$|Historian Robert Poole {{has called}} the Peterloo Massacre one of the {{defining}} moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government {{to crack down on}} reform, with the passing of {{what became known as the}} Six Acts. It also led directly to the foundation of The Manchester Guardian (now The Guardian), but had little other effect on the pace of reform. In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial. Peterloo is commemorated by a plaque close to the site, a replacement for an earlier one that was criticised as being inadequate as it did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> scale of the massacre.|$|E
5|$|Refinement of sulfidic {{zinc ores}} {{produces}} {{large volumes of}} sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes {{per year in the}} 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20to1.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the three domains is of central importance for understanding the origin of life. Most of the metabolic pathways, which are {{the object of the}} majority of an organism's genes, are common between Archaea and Bacteria, while most genes involved in genome expression are common between Archaea and Eukarya. Within prokaryotes, archaeal cell structure is most similar to that of gram-positive bacteria, largely because both have a single lipid bilayer and usually contain a thick sacculus (exoskeleton) of varying chemical composition. In some phylogenetic trees based upon different gene/protein sequences of prokaryotic homologs, the archaeal homologs are more closely related to those of gram-positive bacteria. Archaea and gram-positive bacteria also share conserved indels in a number of important proteins, such as Hsp70 and glutamine synthetaseI; however, the phylogeny of these genes was interpreted to reveal interdomain gene transfer, and might <b>not</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>the</b> organismal relationship(s).|$|E
