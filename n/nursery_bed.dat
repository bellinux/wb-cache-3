In this case the seedlings can grow for four months until they reach a height of 75 to 100 cm subsequently they are top- and root-pruned to about 30 to 20 cm. Stumps are very useful for interplanting among other trees or for a better establishment on steep slopes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{agriculture}} and gardening, transplanting or replanting is {{the technique of}} moving a plant from one location to another.

Types of stock include bareroot seedlings and transplants, and {{various kinds of}} containerized stock. For simplicity, both container-grown and bareroot stock are generally referred to as seedlings, and transplants are nursery stock that have been lifted and transplanted into another <b>nursery</b> <b>bed,</b> usually at wider spacing.

50|$|Seedlings {{to be used}} as {{rootstock}} can {{be raised}} from seed. Several studies indicate that germination can be improved by soaking seeds in sulfuric acid. Germination time can also be shortened to 7 days by carefully cracking the endocarp. Ber seedlings do not tolerate transplanting, therefore the best alternatives are to sow the seeds directly in the field or to use polythene tubes placed in the <b>nursery</b> <b>bed.</b> Seedlings are ready for budding in 3 to 4 months. In addition, seedlings from the wild cultivars can be converted into improved cultivars by top-working and grafting. Nurseries are used for large scale seedling multiplication and graft production. The seedlings should also be given full light. The seedlings may need as long as 15 months in the nursery before planting in the field.|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{phosphorus}} (P) {{management in}} rice production systems requires efficient P application strategies to improve P fertilizer use efficiency {{combined with the}} use of P-efficient genotypes that should ideally have reduced grain P concentrations to lower P removal from the system. In this study, the strategic application of a micro-dose of P to the <b>nursery</b> <b>bed</b> was evaluated as a way to improve seedling vigor and P fertilizer use efficiency and overcome potentially reduced seedling vigor associated with low seed P concentration in transplanted rice. In a first experiment established in two fields differing in soil P supply, two rice genotypes (Mudgo and Santhi Sufaid) were grown with and without P application to a P-deficient <b>nursery</b> <b>bed.</b> In a second experiment established in the same fields with the same genotypes, P application to the <b>nursery</b> <b>bed</b> was evaluated in combination with two seed sources differing in seed P concentration. In both experiments, P application to the <b>nursery</b> <b>bed</b> doubled seedling shoot biomass of both genotypes at transplanting time with a 5 -fold increase in seedling shoot P content in the first experiment. In the first experiment, P application to the <b>nursery</b> <b>bed</b> increased grain yield by 10 – 14 % in the field with higher soil P supply and 30 – 40 % in the field with lower soil P supply. In the second experiment, P application to the <b>nursery</b> <b>bed</b> increased grain yield by 19 – 20 % in the field with lower P supply only, whereas no effect of P application to the <b>nursery</b> <b>bed</b> on yield was observed at higher soil P supply. We conclude that strategic application of micro-doses of P to the <b>nursery</b> <b>bed</b> can substantially enhance seedling vigor and grain yield of transplanted rice at low P supply...|$|E

50|$|The most {{efficient}} way to grow palmarosa is in a nursery with lots of irrigation and soil pH of 7-8. Two or three days before planting, it is best to overwhelm the soil with water to increase soil moisture above 60% when planting the seeds. This moisture increases the germination of the seed and increases weed control in the <b>nursery</b> <b>beds</b> as well. It is also recommended to flood the soil once a month to maintain a high moisture level in the soil. Irrigation in a nursery is most important for the first 40 days. Palmarosa grass grows well in sandy texture soil with low nitrogen, sufficient phosphorus and potassium. Weeds are a problem and keeping them out of the <b>nursery</b> <b>beds</b> will increase the yield. Manual weeding must be done often and involves a well-trained eye to uncover the weeds. Also, palmarosa is often intercropped to help suppress the weeds, thus increasing yields and the land efficiency.
