At the time, Eidos did <b>not</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the story. Eidos Montréal project manager Stéphane D'Astous confirmed the game's existence in November, stating that concept approval had only just been granted. An initial teaser trailer was released on November 26, 2007. The game's official title, first details, and original release window were announced at the 2010 Game Developers Conference. It was published worldwide by Square Enix. While originally scheduled for 2010, the game was shifted to beyond April the following year so the team could further polish the gameplay. It was released for PlayStation 3 (PS3), Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC). The gameplay was identical across all platforms barring control schemes. Originally Eidos had intended to make the PC retail version of the game region locked. The reason behind {{this was due to}} DVD limitations which meant the languages on the game had to be split. However, due to negative reaction from the public, this lock was not implemented.|$|E
5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would <b>not</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and traffic of the event discouraged potential customers from continuing to visit the event in the final week.|$|E

Moore also wrote several articles in The Nation, The New Republic and National Journal, and the newspapers The St. Petersburg Times, The Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune.

5|$|Their {{partnership}} {{continued with}} 2014's Bayonetta 2, which sparked controversy {{for being a}} Wii U exclusive when its predecessor is a multi-platform title. According to executive producer Atsushi Inaba, the company worked with Sega to create the game's sequel. It was later cancelled {{in the middle of}} the game's development until Nintendo offered to work with the company to revive it and fund the project. Sega only served as the game's advisor. Inaba added that Nintendo did not actively interfere with the game's development, and compared its role to that of an observer. Kamiya, who originally did not expect a sequel to the game, served as the game's supervisor. Replacing Kamiya as the game's director is Yusuke Hashimoto. Hashimoto focused on refining the original's combat, and extending the game's replay value. Bayonetta 2 received critical acclaim on its launch, with several gaming publications awarding the game a perfect score. Though Nintendo did <b>not</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the game's sales, the title sold only 38,828 copies in Japan in its first week of release, faring much worse than the original. It became the seventh best-selling retail game in the UK in its first week of release, but sales declined significantly in the second week.|$|E
