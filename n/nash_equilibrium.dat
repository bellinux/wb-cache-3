In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and anticipating the reaction of the firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium</b> the governments choose a level of subsidy that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – an export tax., where m is a competitively produced numéraire good This is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an export tax could reduce the total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the expanse of the third country which imports the good.|$|E

In order to find the <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibriums</b> {{it is necessary to}} search all the feasible combinations of generators’ outputs which satisfy various constraints. The procedure to eliminate the dominated strategies can be formulated using Bellman’s optimality principle of dynamic programming problem and hence the backward or forward search algorithm of dynamic programming can be easily applied. Therefore, the <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibriums</b> are found using dynamic programming method and we found that there exist several <b>Nash</b> <b>Equilibriums</b> in the generation allocation problem. Individual generators participate in a game to maximize its profit through competitions and play a game with bidding strategies of its generation quantities in a spot market. The ramp-rate physically or technically limits generators to increase or decrease outputs in its range and restricts the number of bidding strategies of each generator. We suggest the Dynamic Programming to find the <b>Nash</b> <b>Equilibriums</b> while removing the dominated strategies in each stage (or each time). In the case studies, we analyzed the generation allocation game for a 12 -hour multi-stage and compared it with the results of dynamic economic dispatch.

25|$|In game theory, the <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> {{named after}} American {{mathematician}} John Forbes Nash Jr., {{is a solution}} concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only his own strategy. If each player has chosen a strategy and no player can benefit by changing strategies while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices and the corresponding payoffs constitutes a <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium</b> {{is one of the}} foundational concepts in game theory.

In the given article the full analysis of one class of dyadic lexicographic games is worked out. Such kind of class is the non-cooperative lexicographic games, where each player has got two pure strategies and the payoff of each player solely depends on the strategies of two players in each situation. Therefore, the player's payoffs are given by 2 × 2 matrices, the elements of which are lexicographic utilities.

25|$|The <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium</b> {{was named}} after American {{mathematician}} John Forbes Nash, Jr. A version of the <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium</b> concept was first known {{to be used in}} 1838 by Antoine Augustin Cournot in his theory of oligopoly. In Cournot's theory, firms choose how much output to produce to maximize their own profit. However, the best output for one firm depends on the outputs of others. A Cournot equilibrium occurs when each firm's output maximizes its profits given the output of the other firms, which is a pure-strategy <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Cournot also introduced the concept of best response dynamics in his analysis of the stability of equilibrium. However, Nash's definition of equilibrium is broader than Cournot's. It is also broader than the definition of a Pareto-efficient equilibrium, since the Nash definition makes no judgements about the optimality of the equilibrium being generated.|$|E
25|$|In the past, simple {{game theory}} models, {{such as the}} classic {{cooperative}} hunting and Prisoner's dilemma models, {{were used to determine}} decisions made by animals in cooperative relationships. However, complicated interactions between animals have required the use of more complex economic models such as the <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is a type of non-cooperative game theory that assumes an individual's decision is influenced by its knowledge of the strategies of other individuals. This theory was novel because it took into consideration the higher cognitive capabilities of animals. The evolutionarily stable strategy is a refined version of the <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in that it assumes strategies are heritable and are subject to natural selection. Economic models are useful for analyzing cooperative relationships because they provide predictions on how individuals act when cooperation is an option. Economic models are not perfect, but they provide a general idea of how cooperative relationships work.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to mean field games with major and minor players. Our formulation involves a two player game where the optimization of the representative minor player is standard while the major player faces an optimization over conditional McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations. The definition of this limiting game is justified by proving that its solution provides approximate <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibriums</b> for large finite player games. This proof depends upon the generalization of standard results on the propagation of chaos to conditional dynamics. Because it is on independent interest, we prove this generalization in full detail. Using a conditional form of the Pontryagin stochastic maximum principle (proven in the appendix), we reduce the solution of the mean field game to a forward-backward system of stochastic differential equations of the conditional McKean-Vlasov type, which we solve in the Linear Quadratic setting. We use this class of models to show that <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibriums</b> in our formulation can be {{different from those of the}} formulations contemplated so far in the literature...|$|R

25|$|In his Ph.D. dissertation, John Nash {{proposed}} two {{interpretations of}} his equilibrium concept, {{with the objective}} of showing how equilibrium points ``(...) can be connected with observable phenomenon.

Brandenburger, 1995, ``Epistemic Conditions for <b>Nash</b> <b>Equilibrium,</b> Econometrica, 63, 1161-1180 who interpreted each player's mixed strategy as a conjecture about the behaviour of other players and have shown that if the game and the rationality of players is mutually known and these conjectures are commonly know, then the conjectures must be a <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium</b> (a common prior assumption is needed for this result in general, but not in the case of two players.

25|$|Since the {{development}} of the <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium</b> concept, game theorists have discovered that it makes misleading predictions (or fails to make a unique prediction) in certain circumstances. They have proposed many related solution concepts (also called 'refinements' of Nash equilibria) designed to overcome perceived flaws in the Nash concept. One particularly important issue is that some Nash equilibria may be based on threats that are not 'credible'. In 1965 Reinhard Selten proposed subgame perfect equilibrium as a refinement that eliminates equilibria which depend on non-credible threats. Other extensions of the <b>Nash</b> <b>equilibrium</b> concept have addressed what happens if a game is repeated, or what happens if a game is played in the absence of complete information.
