40|$|The {{degree of}} fasting {{hyperglycemia}} {{in patients with}} <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus {{is dependent on the}} rate of hepatic glucose production. The basal rate of hepatic glucose production is increased in patients with <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus, and there is a positive correlation between hepatic glucose production and fasting glucose levels. Diminished secretion of insulin, impaired hepatic sensitivity to insulin's effects, or a combination of these factors could contribute to the elevated hepatic glucose production in patients with <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus. The relationship between insulin secretion and hepatic glucose production is regulated by a closed feedback loop operating between glucose levels and pancreatic beta cells. Although fasting insulin levels are usually comparable between patients with <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus and normal subjects, insulin secretion is markedly impaired in <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus in relation to the degree of hyperglycemia present. In fact, the degree of fasting hyperglycemia in a given patient with <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus is closely related to the degree of impaired pancreatic beta-cell responsiveness to glucose. Such findings suggest that impaired insulin secretion leads to increased hepatic glucose production, which raises the plasma glucose level. The resulting hyperglycemia helps to maintain relatively normal basal insulin output.

Subcutaneous small arteries were dissected and mounted on a pressurized micromyograph, and the media-to-lumen ratio was evaluated. A similar office blood pressure-lowering effect and a similar reduction of the wall-to-lumen ratio of retinal arterioles were observed with the 2 drugs.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of Metabolic Syndrome and related chronic diseases, among them <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> (type 2) <b>diabetes</b> mellitus, {{are on the}} rise in the United States and throughout the world. Animal models that respond to environmental stressors, such as diet, are useful for investigating the outcome and development of these related diseases. Objective Within this context, growth and energy relationships were characterized in the Nile rat, an exotic African rodent, as a potential animal model for diet-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus and Metabolic Syndrome. Methods Compiled data from several studies established the relationship between age, body weight gain (including abdominal adiposity), food and water consumption, and blood glucose levels as determinants of diabetes in male and female Nile rats. Glucose Tolerance Testing, insulin, HbA 1 c, blood pressure measurements and plasma lipids further characterized the diabetes in relation to criteria of the Metabolic Syndrome, while diet modification with high-fat, low-fiber or food restriction attempted to modulate the disease. Results The Nile rat fed lab chow demonstrates signs of the Metabolic Syndrome that evolve into diet-induced <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> (type 2) <b>diabetes</b> mellitus characterized by hyperinsulinemia with rising blood glucose (insulin resistance), abdominal adiposity, and impaired glucose clearance that precedes increased food and water intake, as well as elevated HbA 1 c, marked elevation in plasma triglycerides and cholesterol, microalbuminuria, and hypertension. Males are more prone than females with rapid progression to diabetes depending on the challenge diet. In males diabetes segregated into early-onset and late-onset groups, the former related to more rapid growth and greater growth efficiency for the calories consumed. Interestingly, no correlation was found between blood glucose and body mass index (overall adiposity) in older male Nile rats in long term studies, whereas blood glucose and the perirenal fat pad, as well as liver and kidney weight, were positively related to early-onset diabetes. Rats weaned early (4 - 5 wks) and challenged with a high-fat Western-type diet developed diabetes faster, and body fat accumulation was more apparent, whereas food restriction curtailed it. Conclusion The Nile rat fed typical rodent diets develops hyperinsulinemia that precedes hyperglycemia (insulin resistance) leading to diet-induced type 2 diabetes associated with hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Dietary modulation affected growth rate (weight gain and central adiposity) to impact disease progression. This rodent model represents a novel system of gene-diet interactions affecting energy utilization that can provide insight into the prevention and treatment of the type 2 diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study {{was carried out}} of all patients with newly acquired insulin dependent diabetes during pregnancy (as distinct from <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> gestational <b>diabetes)</b> seen at the Copenhagen Centre for Diabetes and Pregnancy during 1966 to 1980. The series comprised 63 patients {{with a mean age}} of 27 (SEM 1) years. At diagnosis the mean fasting blood glucose concentration was 15. 6 (1. 3) mmol/l and mean maximal insulin dose 49 (3) IU/day. At a prospective follow up examination a mean of 8 (SEM 1) years after diagnosis 46 of 60 patients (77 %) were being treated with insulin (35 (2) IU/day) and had a very low mean stimulated plasma C peptide value (0. 12 (0. 02) nmol/l) suggesting absent or nearly absent beta cell function. The remaining 14 patients (23 %), not currently receiving insulin, appeared to be severely glucose intolerant, having a mean fasting blood glucose concentration of 13. 4 (1. 2) mmol/l. Thus most of these patients developing insulin dependent diabetes during pregnancy had true type I disease. Compared with the age specific incidence of type I diabetes in the background population of women the incidence was at least 70 % higher in pregnant than non-pregnant women (p less than 0. 001; chi 2 = 11. 6; f = 1). This increased incidence occurred in the third trimester when the risk of developing type I diabetes was 3. 8 times that of non-pregnant women (p less than 0. 000001; chi 2 = 35. 6; f = 1). Finally, the risk of developing insulin dependent diabetes during pregnancy was lower when conception occurred in the winter (p less than 0. 05; chi 2 = 4. 18; f = 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Urinary {{excretion}} of kappa light chains {{in patients}} with diabetes mellitus. The urinary excretion of kappa light chains,β 2 -microglobulin and albumin was examined {{in patients with}} newly diagnosed and long-standing insulin-dependent (IDDM) and <b>non-insulin-dependent</b> (NIDDM) <b>diabetes</b> mellitus, and compared to age-matched control subjects. Patients with IDDM diagnosed within two months, presented with normal albumin excretion, whereas the concentrations of β 2 -microglobulin and kappa light chain in urine were higher than in control subjects. The initiation of insulin therapy reduced, but did not completely normalize, the elevated rate of kappa light chain excretion. Patients with IDDM of long duration showed increased urine excretion of kappa light chains and albumin. In keeping with the findings in IDDM, patients with newly diagnosed NIDDM (within one year) showed increased urinary excretion of kappa light chains compared with control subjects. There was, however, no further increase in light chain excretion with longer duration of NIDDM. To study the effect of short-term hyperglycemia on urinary protein excretion, 12 normal subjects participated in a three-step hyperglycemic clamp study, during which their plasma glucose concentration was raised by + 50, + 125 and + 300 mg/dl. The urine excretion of albumin and β; 2 -microglobulin rose progressively with each hyperglycemic clamp step, whereas that of kappa light chain excretion was unaffected by hyperglycemia. We conclude that increased urinary excretion of kappa light chain is a consistent finding in all types of diabetes mellitus, and can be observed even when the albumin excretion is normal. Since the serum concentration of kappa light chain is normal in diabetes, the increased urinary excretion of kappa light chains must be of renal origin. Although the underlying mechanism(s) responsible for the kappa light chainuria are unknown, it cannot be ascribed {{to the effect of}} acute hyperglycemia on glomerular and tubular function...|$|R
