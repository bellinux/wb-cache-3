This prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values. The low-pass prototype can also be transformed into high-pass, band-pass or band-stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with limiters, a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E

500|$|While 30Ω {{cable is}} highly {{desirable}} for its power handling capabilities, {{it has never}} been in commercial production because the large size of inner conductor makes it difficult to manufacture. This is not the case with 77Ω cable. [...] Cable with 75Ω <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> has been in use from an early period in telecommunications for its low loss characteristic. [...] According to Stephen Lampen of Belden Wire & Cable 75Ω was chosen as the <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> rather than 77Ω because it corresponded to a standard AWG wire size for the inner conductor. [...] For coax video cables and interfaces 75Ω is now the near universal standard <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> is used, however, to characterise the {{transducers}} of {{an audio}} system, {{such as its}} microphones and loudspeakers. [...] It is important that these are connected to a circuit capable of dealing with impedances in the appropriate range and assigning a <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> is a convenient way of quickly determining likely incompatibilities. [...] Loudspeakers and microphones are dealt with in separate sections below.|$|E
500|$|The {{impedance}} of {{a loudspeaker}} is not constant across all frequencies. [...] In a typical loudspeaker the impedance will rise {{with increasing frequency}} from its DC value, {{as shown in the}} diagram, until it reaches a point of its mechanical resonance. [...] Following resonance, the impedance falls to a minimum and then begins to rise again. [...] Speakers are usually designed to operate at frequencies above their resonance, and for this reason it is the usual practice to define <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> at this minimum and then round to the nearest standard value. [...] The ratio of the peak resonant frequency to the <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> can be as much as 4:1. [...] It is, however, still perfectly possible for the low frequency impedance to actually be lower than the <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance.</b> [...] A given audio amplifier may not be capable of driving this low frequency impedance even though it is capable of driving the <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance,</b> a problem that can be solved either with the use of crossover filters or underrating the amplifier supplied.|$|E
500|$|There are a {{large number}} of {{different}} types of microphone and there are correspondingly large differences in impedance between them. [...] They range from the very low impedance of ribbon microphones (can be less than one ohm) to the very large impedance of piezoelectric microphones which are measured in megohms.

500|$|It is usual {{practice}} {{to speak of}} <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> {{as if it were}} a constant resistance, that is, it is invariant with frequency and has a zero reactive component, despite this often being far from the case.

500|$|In {{the days}} of valves (vacuum tubes), most {{loudspeakers}} had a <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> of 16Ω. [...] Valve outputs require an output transformer to match the very high output impedance and voltage of the output valves to this lower impedance. [...] These transformers were commonly tapped to allow matching of the output to a multiple loudspeaker setup. [...] For example, two 16Ω loudspeakers in parallel will give an impedance of 8Ω. [...] Since the advent of solid-state amplifiers whose outputs require no transformer, the once-common multiple-impedance outputs have become rare, and lower impedance loudspeakers more common. [...] The most common <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> for a single loudspeaker is now 8Ω. [...] Most solid-state amplifiers are designed to work with loudspeaker combinations of anything from 4Ω to 8Ω.|$|E
500|$|A simple tee {{circuit of}} {{resistors}} {{can be used}} as a power divider as shown in figure 18. [...] This circuit can also be implemented as a delta circuit by applying the Y-Δ transform. [...] The delta form uses resistors that are equal to the system impedance. [...] This can be advantageous because precision resistors of the value of the system impedance are always available for most system <b>nominal</b> <b>impedances.</b> [...] The tee circuit has the benefits of simplicity, low cost, and intrinsically wide bandwidth. [...] It has two major drawbacks; first, the circuit will dissipate power since it is resistive: an equal split will result in [...] insertion loss instead of [...] [...] The second problem is that there is [...] directivity leading to very poor isolation between the output ports.|$|R
500|$|In 1988, Linn externalised the {{crossover}} of the DMS to boards with <b>nominal</b> 4-ohm <b>impedance</b> {{designed to}} lie flat {{at the base}} of the stands.

25|$|An {{amplifier}} {{operating under}} linear (small signal) conditions {{is a good}} example of a non-reciprocal network and a matched attenuator is an example of a reciprocal network.

The <b>nominal</b> system <b>impedance,</b> frequency and any other factors which may influence the device, such as temperature, must also be specified.|$|R
500|$|Impedance scaling is {{invariably}} a scaling to a fixed resistance. [...] This {{is because}} the terminations of the filter, at least nominally, are taken to be a fixed resistance.

500|$|It is {{necessary}} for antimetry that the terminating impedances are also the dual of each other, but in many practical cases the two terminating impedances are resistors and are both equal to the <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> R0.

500|$|References to {{symmetry}} and antimetry of {{a network}} usually refer to the input impedances of a two-port network when correctly terminated.

25|$|Driver ratings {{based on}} the SPL for a given input are called {{sensitivity}} ratings and are notionally similar to efficiency.

500|$|Local area {{networks}} (LANs) commonly use {{a similar}} kind of twisted pair cable, but screened and manufactured to tighter tolerances than {{is necessary for}} telephony.

500|$|For {{the most}} part, audio systems both {{professional}} and domestic, have their components interconnected with low impedance outputs connected to high impedance inputs. [...] These impedances are poorly defined and nominal impedances {{are not usually}} assigned {{for this kind of}} connection. [...] The exact impedances make little difference to performance as long as the latter is many times larger than the former. [...] This is a common interconnection scheme, not just for audio, but for electronic units in general which form part of a larger equipment or are only connected over a short distance. [...] Where audio needs to be transmitted over large distances, which is often the case in broadcast engineering, considerations of matching and reflections dictate that a telecommunications standard is used, which would normally mean using 600 Ω <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> (although other standards are sometimes encountered, such as sending at 75 Ω and receiving at 600 Ω which has bandwidth advantages). [...] The <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> of the transmission line and of the amplifiers and equalisers in the transmission chain will all be the same value.|$|E
500|$|Loudspeaker {{impedances}} {{are kept}} relatively low {{compared with other}} audio components so that the required audio power can be transmitted without using inconveniently (and dangerously) high voltages. [...] The most common <b>nominal</b> <b>impedance</b> for loudspeakers is 8Ω. [...] Also used are 4Ω and 16Ω.

This is due to the <b>nominal</b> line <b>impedance</b> (measured in Ohms but comprising both resistance and inductance) of balanced lines being somewhat lower than that of UTP, thus supporting 'weaker' signals (however the solid-state electronics required to construct such digital interfaces are more costly).|$|R
50|$|The {{electrical}} characteristics of DMX512 cable are specified {{in terms of}} impedance and capacitance, although there are often mechanical and other considerations that must be considered as well.

Cat5 cable, commonly used for networking and telecommunications, has been tested by ESTA for use with DMX512A. Also, cables designed for EIA485 typically meet the DMX512 electrical specifications. Conversely, microphone and line level audio cables lack the requisite {{electrical characteristics}} and thus are not suitable for DMX512 cabling. The significantly lower impedance and higher capacitance of these cables distort the DMX512 digital waveforms, which in turn can cause irregular operation or intermittent errors {{that are difficult to}} identify and correct.|$|R
