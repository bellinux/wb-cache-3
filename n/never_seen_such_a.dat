On this basis, he believes that the crowd saw what it wanted to see. McClure also stated that he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> collection of contradictory accounts of a case in any of the research that he had done in the previous ten years.|$|E
500|$|In Igor's wake, a {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared for 30communities in Newfoundland. The mayor of one of the towns affected by Igor, Sam Synard, remarked that [...] "We've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> violent storm before." [...] More than 50 families involved in the storm-induced destruction were relocated to evacuation shelters. Electricity was gradually restored to residents; by six days after the hurricane's passage, a few hundred had yet to regain power.|$|E
500|$|Michels {{stated that}} the victory was proof that Ajax could match teams in Europe: [...] "The Liverpool game was for me an {{important}} moment to be acknowledged and recognised internationally. Not only the first game, because {{that could have been}} an accident – with the weather conditions etc. No, the performance we achieved in Liverpool under bad circumstances – I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> hectic situation. We drew that game 2–2 and never really had problems. For me, it was the proof that we were at the international level." ...|$|E

500|$|Lewis became {{interested}} in making a film about hustlers because (despite there being films about hustlers dating back more than three decades) he had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> film. In Lewis's own words, [...] "When I started, there were no hustler movies and now there's a whole genre." [...] His original concept for Skin & Bone {{was that it would}} be a series of 70 one-minute shots. Lewis changed his mind about the concept following some improvisation with actor B. Wyatt in creating the Harry character. Much of the film was improvised. After a year of filming improvisation sessions, Lewis wrote some scripted material to provide some story structure. Shooting took several years to complete because the film was almost entirely self-financed.|$|E
500|$|The {{new version}} of the song was {{recorded}} on February 1, 2010, in a session lasting 14 hours. Eighty-five musicians were reportedly involved in the song's recording, which was held in the same place as the original, at Henson Recording Studio on La Brea Avenue in Los Angeles, California. Also similar to the 1985 process, some of the participating musicians were already in Los Angeles to attend an awards ceremony: the 52nd Grammy Awards. Jones said of the recording session, [...] "It was a big challenge. It takes a serious army and serious emotional architecture. I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> diverse group of people, and they came for the right reasons." [...] The recording process brought together diverse artists, with the oldest being 83-year-old Tony Bennett and the youngest being 9-year-old Ethan Bortnick.|$|E
500|$|During 1884, the 44-year-old Tchaikovsky {{began to}} shed the unsociability and restlessness that had plagued him since his {{abortive}} marriage in 1878, and which had {{caused him to}} travel incessantly throughout Russia and Western Europe. In March 1884, Tsar Alexander III conferred upon him the Order of St. Vladimir (fourth class), which carried with it hereditary nobility, and won Tchaikovsky a personal audience with the Tsar. The Tsar's decoration was a visible seal of official approval, which helped Tchaikovsky's rehabilitation from the stigma associated with the conditions of his marriage. This rehabilitation may have been cemented in the composer's mind {{with the success of}} his Third Orchestral Suite at its January 1885 premiere in St. Petersburg, under Hans von Bülow's direction. Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness Nadezhda von Meck: [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> triumph. I saw the whole audience was moved, and grateful to me. These moments are the finest adornments of an artist's life. Thanks to these it is worth living and laboring." [...] The press was likewise unanimously favorable.|$|E

500|$|Painter Maqbool Fida Hussain {{found his}} muse in Madhuri Dixit after {{watching}} the part of Hum Aapke Hai Koun...! where [...] "Didi Tera Devar Deewana" [...] is performed. He went on to watch the film 67 times. About Dixit's dance in the song Hussain confessed, [...] "That movement of the hips is out of this world. I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> dancer, and I have seen the best. Her words are transformed into body language." [...] He painted a series of paintings inspired from Dixit. Madhuri as Menaka with Vishwamitra, Madhuri as Radha with Nand Lala, Madhuri playing tennis at Wimbledon were some of those paintings. The Menaka painting was inspired from the famous painting of apsara Menaka as painted by Raja Ravi Verma. Another painting also showed Dixit with Meryl Streep leaning over a bridge in Madison County and Clint Eastwood on horseback below. The painting Nautanki showed Dixit with a backless blouse turning behind like the step in [...] "Didi Tera Devar Deewana", however this time sporting a nine yards Maharashtrian saree.|$|E
500|$|During Governor Shelby's term, the General Assembly {{had passed}} laws {{requiring}} that the governor, auditor, treasurer, {{and secretary of}} state live in Frankfort and allocating a sum of 100 pounds to rent living quarters for the governor. Shortly after Garrard took office, the state commissioners of public buildings reported to the legislature that it would be more financially sensible to construct a house for the governor and his large family than to rent living quarters for them for the duration of his term. On December 4, 1796, the General Assembly passed legislation appropriating 1,200 pounds for the construction of such a house. The state's first governor's mansion was completed in 1798. Garrard incited considerable public interest when, in 1799, he commissioned a local craftsman to build a piano for one of his daughters; most Kentuckians had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> grand instrument, and a considerable number of them flocked to the governor's mansion to see it when it was finished. Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark also relates that Garrard's addition of carpeting to the mansion [...] a rare amenity at the time [...] drew many visitors and was described by one as [...] "the envy and pride of the community".|$|E
500|$|While {{ultimately}} an Israeli victory, the Battle of the Chinese Farm has {{an especially}} infamous legacy among Israeli participants, {{and it is}} remembered {{as one of the}} most brutal battles of the war—and for the heavy losses incurred by both the Egyptians and Israelis. After the battle had ended, Dayan visited the area of the battlefield. Reshef, who accompanied him, said, [...] "Look at this valley of death." [...] The minister, taken aback by the great destruction before him, muttered in an undertone, [...] "What you people have done here!" [...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the eye could see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{follows from}} the causal theory of reference. Words always refer {{to the kinds of}} things they were coined to refer to, thus the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, {{experience}}d. So, if some person, Mary, were a [...] "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the [...] "mad scientist", then Mary's idea of a [...] "brain" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] brain, since she and her linguistic community have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thing. Rather, she saw something that looked like a brain, but was actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a [...] "vat" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] vat. So, if, as a brain in a vat, she were to say [...] "I'm a brain in a vat", she would actually be saying [...] "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic {{said that the}} plot of the episode had a [...] "nice story arc when the cause of death ranged from disease, to suicide, and finally murder". She added that Nikki's family was a [...] "nightmare". She was surprised that Bill was not involved in killing Nikki, saying that he [...] "came across as a bit of a jerk for most of the episode", adding that Nikki had a [...] "short, sad life". Orlando praised the detail of Nikki's neck, noticing the bruising to show she was strangled. She said, [...] "I generally hate gore yet I found myself fascinated by the autopsy of the girl's neck. Maybe it was the detail of the muscle and the lack of blood but I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> procedure portrayed with that level of specificity". Orlando carried on saying, [...] "Is there some rule that we can't have both detectives every week? Detective Baker's definitely growing on me but I missed Bud. He and Megan had some great chemistry and I was hoping for more of {{that by the end of}} the season". Orlando understood Megan's reaction to the fact that Kate was dating Todd, calling it [...] "justified", saying it was an [...] "odd position to be in", but summarized; [...] "she'll just have to get over it". Orlando was worried whether Todd deserved Kate saying that; [...] "the jury is still out on Todd". She praised how this storyline turned out to be a [...] "great bonding moment" [...] between Megan and Lacey, saying she [...] "liked" [...] that Megan was honest with Lacey adding, [...] "I like it when adults actually act like adults".|$|E
