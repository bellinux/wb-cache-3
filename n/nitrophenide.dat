(1948) reported the aver-age mortality due to coccidiosis of broilers started on clean litter and given 0. 0125 percent sulfaquinoxaline continuously was 1. 20 percent. The mortality due to coc-cidiosis of non-medicated controls was 17. 43 percent. Singsen et al. (1948) found 0. 01 or 0. 02 percent sulfaquinoxaline in the feed did not reduce the growth of either male or female chicks up to eight weeks of age. The inclusion of 0. 03 per-cent sulfaquinoxaline in the diet definitely retarded the growth of female chicks. Bletner et al. (1953) reported sulfaquin-oxaline fed continuously for four weeks at levels of 0. 00625 and 0. 0125 percent did not affect either growth or feed utilization. A level of 0. 05 percent fed continuously gave somewhat inconsistent results indi-cating that continuous feeding at this level may be slightly toxic in certain ra-tions. <b>Nitrophenide</b> (3, 3 -dinitrodiphenyldi-sulfide) {{has been used as}} a coccidiostat. Bottorff (1949) found that chickens fed 0. 0125 percent <b>nitrophenide</b> continuously, from two days through 11 weeks of age,...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} in which nitrofurazone, sulfaquinoxaline, <b>nitrophenide</b> and furazolidone have been compared as additives to feed for fryer chicks maintained on old built-up litter containing coccidia. The 3 trials repre-sented the 4 th, Sth and 6 th times the same litter was used for 11 -week fryer tests. Prior to these tests, mortality from coc-cidiosis had been a problem. The results of these tests indicate: 1. When old built-up litter is used and no real coccidial infection is apparent, sulfaquinoxaline and nitrofurazone at the levels used were of no value in enhancing growth rate. 2. Furazolidone at levels of SS and 110 ppm. promoted increased growth under conditions of the tests...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe polyol {{mannitol}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} compatible solutes in Neosartorya fischeri and accumulates in conidia and ascospores. Here, it is shown that biosynthesis of mannitol in N. fischeri mainly depends on mannitol 1 -phosphate dehydrogenase (MpdA). Reporter studies and qPCR analysis demonstrated that mpdA is moderately expressed in vegetative hyphae and conidiophores, while it is highly expressed during development of ascospores. Deletion of mpdA reduced mannitol in whole cultures as much as 85 % of the wild type, while trehalose levels had increased more than 4 -fold. Decreased mannitol accumulation had no effect on mycelial growth irrespective of heat- or oxidative stress. Notably, conidia of the ΔmpdA strain had higher mannitol and lower trehalose levels. They were more sensitive to heat stress. The most distinct phenotype of mpdA deletion was the absence of full development of ascospores. Formation of cleistothecia, and asci was not affected. The ascus cell wall, however, did not dissolve and asci contained incompletely formed or aborted ascospores. Addition of the Mpd inhibitor <b>nitrophenide</b> to the wild type strain also resulted in disturbed ascospore formation. Taken together, these results show that mannitol has a role in sexual development of N. fischeri and in stress resistance of conidia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDi- and trinitrophenide anions {{generated}} by decarboxylation of the anions of 2, 4 -, 3, 5 -, and 2, 6 -dinitrobenzoic acids and 1, 3, 5 -trinitrobenzoic acid in the medium-pressure region of an electrospray ion source react locally with various C-H acids {{delivered in the}} form of vapors mixed with the curtain gas, yielding anionic σ-adducts. Positive results were obtained for aliphatic aldehydes, ketones, esters and nitriles. All three dinitrobenzoic acids bearing NO 2 groups in the meta position to each other gave the same σ-adducts which can be rationalized by a reaction sequence including proton transfer from the C-H acid to the <b>nitrophenide</b> anion and subsequent formation of the σ-adduct by the reaction of 1, 3 -dinitrobenzene with the carbanion within the ion-molecule complex. It was found that such a reaction is possible only for C-H acids with a gas-phase acidity lying within a narrow, strictly defined range whose location on the acidity scale depends on the acidity of the nitroarene. The σ-adduct formed in the reaction of the 2, 4 -dinitrophenide anion with CH 2 Cl 2 undergoes rapid HCl elimination yielding an anion with the same composition as that produced by the Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution of hydrogen reaction but with a different structure...|$|E

40|$|In the gas-phase {{reactions}} of halonitro- and dinitrophenide anions with X (X = F, Cl, Br, NO 2) and NO 2 groups in ortho or para position {{to each other}} with selected C-H acids: CH 3 CN, CH 3 COCH 3, and CH 3 NO 2, products of the SNAr-type reaction are formed. <b>Nitrophenide</b> anions are generated by decarboxylation of the respective nitrobenzenecarboxylate anions in ESI ion source and the SNAr reaction takes place either in the medium-pressure zone of the ion source or in the collision chamber of the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. In the case of F, Cl, and NO 2 derivatives, the main ionic product is the respective [NO 2 -Ph-CHR]− anion (R = CN, COCH 3, NO 2). In the case of Br derivatives, the main ionic product is Br− ion because it has lower proton affinity than the [NO 2 -Ph-CHR]− anion (for R = CN, COCH 3). For some halonitrophenide anion C–H acid pairs of reactants, the SNAr reaction is competed by the formation of halophenolate anions. This reaction can be rationalized by the single electron-transfer mechanism or by homolytic C–H bond cleavage in the proton-bound complex, both resulting {{in the formation of}} the halonitrobenzene radical anion, which in turn undergoes –NO 2 to –ONO rearrangement followed by the NO· elimination...|$|E
