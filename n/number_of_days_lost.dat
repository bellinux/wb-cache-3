50|$|During downturns, or when {{management}} {{tries to}} reduce the number of permanent employees, strikes often occur. The number of working days lost to labor disputes peaked in the economic turmoil of 1974 and 1975 at around 9 million workdays in the two-year period. In 1979, however, there were fewer than 1 million days lost. Since 1981 the average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>lost</b> per worker each year to disputes was just over 9% of the number lost in the United States. After 1975, when the economy entered a period of slower growth, annual wage increases moderated and labor relations were conciliatory. During the 1980s, workers received pay hikes that on average closely reflected the real growth of GNP for the preceding year. In 1989, for example, workers received an average 5.1% pay hike, while GNP growth had averaged 5% between 1987 and 1989. The moderate trend continued in the early 1990s as the country's national labor federations were reorganizing themselves.|$|E

Materials and Methods: The study was carried out in the Department of surgery, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India. The study included 86 cases of solitary renal calculi in the retroperitoneoscopic (RPPL) group and 82 cases in the shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) group.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{presents}} the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a non-monetary economic measure of impact, lost to dengue in Puerto Rico {{for the period}} 1984 – 1994. Data {{on the number of}} reported cases, cases with hemorrhagic manifestations, hospitalizations, and deaths were obtained from a surveillance system maintained at the Dengue Branch, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (San Juan, PR). The reported cases were divided into two age groups (0 – 15 years old and. 15 years old), and then multiplied by predetermined factors (10 for 0 – 15 years; 27 for. 15 years) to allow for age-related under-reporting of cases. Severity of dengue was modeled by classifying cases into three groups: dengue fever, dengue with severe manifes-tations, and hospitalized cases. Each group was assigned a different <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>lost</b> because of dengue-related disability. Dengue caused an average of 658 DALYs per year per million population (SE 5 114, range 5 145 – 1, 519). A multivariate sensitivity analysis, which simultaneously altered the values of six input variables, produced a mean of 580 DALYs/year/million population, with a maximum average of 1, 021 DALYs/year/million population, and a maximum, single-year estimate for 1994 of 2, 153 DALYs/million population. The most important input was the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>lost</b> to classic dengue.

40|$|Methods. Three-hundred {{and twenty}} {{patients}} with early (1 year) RA were assessed at regular intervals. Clinical and laboratory {{data were collected}} and patients reported health-care utilization and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>lost</b> from work. At 3 -month follow-up, patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to disease activity, using DAS- 28 with a cut-off level at 3. 2. Direct and indirect costs and EuroQol- 5 D over the following 4 years were compared between the groups. Multivariate regression models were used to control for possible covariates. Results. Three months after diagnosis, a DAS- 28 level of epsilon 3. 2 was associated with high direct and indirect costs over the following 4 years. Patients with DAS- 28 epsilon 3. 2 at 3 -month follow-up had more visits to physician, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and nurse, higher drug costs, more days in hospital and more extensive surgery compared with patients with 3 -month DAS- 28 less than 3. 2. <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>lost</b> from work due to sick leave and permanent work disability was also higher in this group. The effect of disease activity on health-related quality of life was highly significant. In regression models, DAS- 28 at 3 -month follow-up was significantly associated with costs over the following years. Conclusions. Three months after diagnosis, DAS- 28 is an important prognostic marker regarding health-care utilization and costs. Achieving remission or low disease activity 3 months after diagnosis is likely to decrease morbidity, increase quality of life and save costs for the patient and for society over the following years.

We thank Asim Ansari, Eric Bradlow, Peter Fader, Raghu Iyengar, and Ka Lok Lee for invaluable comments and suggestions regarding the model and its estimation. 1 We develop and estimate a stochastic model of patient compliance and persistence regarding pharmaceutical drugs. Persistence refers to whether a patient continues with therapy, i. e., whether the patient continues to obtain refills of the drug. Compliance refers to whether the customer obtains a refill on time, given {{he or she does}} in fact obtain a refill. We develop a simple stochastic model of these behaviors, drawing on models of customer value developed by Schmittlein, Morrison, and Colombo (1987) and Fader, Hardie, and Lee (2005).
