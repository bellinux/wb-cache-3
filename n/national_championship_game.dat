5|$|By contract, the top {{two teams}} in the BCS Poll at the {{conclusion}} of the regular season were invited to the BCS <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game.</b> In 2000, the BCS Poll was a combination of four different systems: media and coaches' polls (Associated Press college football poll and USA Today Coaches' Poll), team records, a collection of eight different computer ranking systems, and a strength-of-schedule component based on opponent records. Under the BCS, the site of the <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> rotated every year. In 2000, there were four BCS bowl games: the Rose Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Orange Bowl, and the Fiesta Bowl. The <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> rotated to a different location each year, and the other three games served as bowl games for lower-ranked teams. Later, in 2007, the BCS National Championship was created, adding a fifth BCS bowl. In 2000, the Sugar Bowl was scheduled to host the <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{decade after}} Virginia Tech's {{selection}} the 1995 Sugar Bowl {{and five years}} after its appearance in a Sugar Bowl game {{that served as the}} <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game,</b> Tech was again selected to play in New Orleans' annual Sugar Bowl game. The No. 9 Hokies finished the regular season 10–2 and won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship their first year in the conference, winning an automatic bid to the game. Facing the Hokies were the No. 3 Auburn Tigers, who had gone 12–0 during the regular season. Normally, Auburn's undefeated season would have been justification for a spot in the 2005 BCS <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game,</b> but because two other teams had also gone undefeated during the regular season, Auburn, as the No. 3 team in the country, was left out of the <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E

5|$|On Memorial Day, Monday May 26, Syracuse {{defeated}} Johns Hopkins in the <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> 13–10 {{in front}} of 48,970 fans at Gillette Stadium. This game set the attendance record for the NCAA lacrosse championship game and for any NCAA outdoor championship.

This is John Desko's, Syracuse's Head coach, fourth championship in his ten-year career at Syracuse.|$|E
5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game</b> was {{televised}} {{across the}} United States by CBS.

A total of 17.52 million homes, 30% of the television audience, watched the game. The broadcast earned a 21.5 Nielsen Rating, the second highest for the NCAA <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game</b> at the time, after 1979.|$|E
5|$|After {{surviving}} numerous close games {{during the}} regular season, conference tournament, and most recently a triple overtime game against Michigan State in the national semifinal, North Carolina came into the <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game</b> with an unblemished record of 310. Led by coach Frank McGuire and Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year Lennie Rosenbluth, the Tar Heels were ranked first overall in the AP Poll. Kansas came into the <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>game</b> with two losses, which were credited to poor ball control on the Jayhawks part. The Kansas Jayhawks, led by Sophomore phenom and Firstteam All-American Wilt Chamberlain, came into the game favored to win against the Tar Heels of North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|After the Hokies' {{participation}} in the 2000 BCS <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game,</b> the Virginia Tech entered the 2000-2001 college football season with high expectations. Until late in the season, those hopes were borne out, and it appeared as if the Hokies {{would return to the}} <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game.</b> After a late-season loss to No.3-ranked Miami, however, Tech was knocked out of contention for the national title. Following the conclusion of its 10–1 season, No. 6 Tech was selected to participate in the Gator Bowl. Facing the Hokies were the No. 16 Clemson Tigers, who had finished 9–2 during the regular season.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, Nick Saban {{was hired}} as head coach, and has led the Crimson Tide to bowl {{appearances}} {{in each of his}} five seasons at Alabama. After defeating Colorado in the Independence Bowl, Saban led Alabama to their second BCS bowl against Utah in the Sugar Bowl. In 2009, Saban led the Crimson Tide to the BCS <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game,</b> and defeated Texas 37–21 to clinch the program's first national title of the BCS era. A year after Alabama defeated Michigan State in the 2011 Capital One Bowl, the Crimson Tide defeated LSU in the BCS <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> to clinch the program's second national title of the BCS era. The following season, the Crimson Tide won their second consecutive BCS <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> by a final score of 42–14 over Notre Dame. In their latest bowl appearance, Alabama lost to Clemson in the College Football Playoff National Championship. The loss brought Alabama's overall bowl record to 39wins, 26 losses and 3ties, placing the Crimson Tide in first place among all FBS schools for both bowl appearances and victories.|$|E

5|$|In {{the month}} {{prior to the}} Sugar Bowl, media {{attention}} focused on Virginia Tech's sudden rise to national prominence and Florida State's perennial appearance in the <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game.</b> The Seminoles had the most top-5 finishes and the most <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> appearances of any team in the 1990s, including a national championship victory in 1993. Many media stories focused on the apparent David and Goliath showdown between the two teams, with the Seminoles {{in the role of}} the overdog and the Hokies {{in the role of the}} underdog. Because of this fact, spread bettors favored Florida State to win the game by 5.5points.|$|E

Butler won their next game when they defeated Wisconsin. On March 26, 2011, the Bulldogs beat Florida 74–71 in overtime to earn back-to-back trips to the Final Four. On April 2, Butler beat fellow Cinderella team VCU 70–62 {{to make it to}} a second consecutive <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game.</b> For the second consecutive year, the Bulldogs fell in the <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game,</b> this time to Connecticut.|$|E

Florida State players and coaches entered the off-season hoping to improve upon their runner-up finish in the <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> the year before, and were voted the No. 1 team in the country in the annual Associated Press preseason poll.|$|E
5|$|The at-large {{spot in the}} Orange Bowl {{was filled}} via a {{round-robin}} selection procedure defined by the other Bowl Championship series games (the Sugar, Fiesta, and Rose bowls) and the automatic bids.

In the 2010 season, teams otherwise designated for the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl were picked for the <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game.</b> Following the two compensatory selections are the at-large picks. The order of at-large selections rotates annually among the BCS bowls.|$|E

Despite their appearance in the previous year's <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game,</b> the Seminoles were ranked as the No. 5 team {{in the country in}} the USA Today college football preseason poll. Florida State, which had a 702 record in Atlantic Coast Conference games since joining the conference, was again favored to win the ACC, but the Seminoles faced challenges replacing Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Chris Weinke and 14 other starters from the previous year's team. Adding to the Seminoles' challenges in the 2001 season was the loss of two starting wide receivers: Robert Morgan and Anquan Boldin, both of whom suffered season-ending injuries before {{the first game of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the Sugar Bowl {{was held}} {{under the rules}} of the Bowl Alliance.

Each year, the two highest-ranked teams would play in a <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> held in place of one of the bowl games. The site of the <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> rotated among the three bowl games, as did the date of each game.
