Cheeseman observed that Lody only appeared uneasy when his notebook was being examined; the inspector later commented that Lody was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> class of man he was accustomed to dealing with, but {{admitted that he had}} never met a man under precisely similar circumstances. Cheeseman had been educated in Germany, knew the language and felt able to recognise a German accent; he noticed that Lody's American accent slipped from time to time, presumably due to stress, and became convinced that the man was German.|$|E

25|$|Tuna in {{particular}} are of major importance to commercial fisheries. Though tuna migrate across oceans, trying to find them there is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> approach. Tuna tend to congregate in areas where food is abundant, along the boundaries of currents, around islands, near seamounts, and {{in some areas of}} upwelling along continental slopes. Tuna are captured by several methods: purse seine vessels enclose an entire surface school with special nets, pole and line vessels which use poles baited with other smaller pelagic fish as baitfish, and rafts called fish aggregating devices are set up, because tuna, as well as some other pelagic fish, tend to congregate under floating objects.|$|E
500|$|The cantata is scored {{for three}} vocal soloists (alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, and a Baroque {{instrumental}} ensemble of a slide trumpet, two recorders, two oboes da caccia, strings and basso continuo. This is an unusually rich instrumentation for an ordinary Sunday. Bach {{created in the}} opening chorus an unusual [...] "uncompromising" [...] fugue for up to nine parts. The bass aria with an obbligato trumpet, depicting God's wrath compared to a thunderstorm, has been regarded as [...] "more frightening" [...] than any contemporary operatic 'rage' arias. The closing chorale is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> simple four-part setting, but includes instrumental interludes reminiscent of motifs used before.|$|E
500|$|Kill the Irishman {{received}} mixed-to-positive {{reviews from}} film critics. Giving the film a positive review, Mike LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, said; [...] "What makes this film special and memorable is {{the character of}} Danny Greene, who is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> neighborhood hoodlum you see in movies, the kind who gets in deep and gradually loses his soul". Marshall Fine, of the Huffington Post, gave the film a mixed review. He criticized it for jumping through different events in a [...] "jerky fashion", but summed up the review by calling it a [...] "movie {{with a lot of}} meat on the bone, even if some of it is tough or stringy. It's not fancy, but it's always tasty".|$|E

500|$|Performance {{time of the}} Magnificat lies {{typically}} between 25 and 30 minutes, with {{an additional}} five minutes for the Christmas interpolations. The duration of the version without Christmas hymns is comparable with that of an average Bach cantata. However, there are many differences: the Magnificat contains about twice as many movements as an average cantata, keeping it short by avoiding da capos in the arias, and altogether no recitatives. Also the text is in Latin (<b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> language for a Bach cantata), {{the architecture of the}} movements is fairly complex, as opposed to the fairly simple structure of an average cantata, and the choral writing is in five parts, [...] "outside the normal routine of Bach's sacred vocal works".|$|E

They have an emotional, tender quality to their music, {{even when it}} gets aggressive. I didn’t want the score to be overly aggressive, I {{wanted it to be}} haunting and emotional. Steve Jablonsky came in at the end to do something more traditional, but when Steve does [...] "traditional", it's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> strings. He created a wonderful sound at the very end." [...] Songs featured in the film include [...] "Canned Heat" [...] by Jamiroquai, and [...] "Heroes" [...] performed by Peter Gabriel and the New Blood Orchestra, which is played {{at the end of the}} film during a four-minute montage that features actual photos and videos of the fallen servicemen.|$|E
500|$|Conran and Avnet {{were able}} to cut costs {{considerably}} by shooting the entire movie in 26 days (<b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> {{three to four months}} that this kind of movie normally takes) on high-definition video using a Sony HDW-F900 and working entirely on three different blue screen soundstages in London, England with one notable exception. Conran wrote a scene that was added later in which Polly talks to her editor in his office that was shot on a physical set because {{there was no time to}} shoot it on a blue screen soundstage. The footage from the HD camera was run through a switcher and then through a Macintosh computer running Final Cut Pro that allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. Conran said, [...] "I don't know how we would have made this movie. It's really what allowed us to line up everything, given there was nothing there." [...] After each day of shooting, footage was edited and sent overnight to editors in L.A. who added CG and sent it back.|$|E

500|$|In 1941 Anderson {{completed}} her PhD at the University of Wisconsin, writing her thesis on [...] "Low energy {{levels in the}} atomic spectra Co VII and Ni VIII". Immediately after finishing her PhD, Anderson requested time off from her position at Milwaukee-Downer College, in order to conduct war research related to the Manhattan Project at the Office of Scientific Research and Development at Princeton University. Not long after, Anderson was recruited to continue her work specifically at Los Alamos Laboratory. At her new location, Anderson studied basic fission parameters, including analyzing the time delays associated with the absorption and emission of neutrons. [...] Such work often entailed working upwards of sixteen hours a day. [...] Among other accomplishments at Los Alamos, Anderson prepared the first sample of pure uranium-235 at the laboratory. While there, {{she lived in a}} dormitory, and being older than most of the other residents (she was aged fifty), she was put in charge. She often worked at night, wearing jeans and a plaid shirt– <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> attire for a woman at the time.|$|E

The first suit was labeled 007, and the second had both a label, 008, and a name, [...] "Lawyer". Investigators determined the second spacesuit was one used by Lawyer who {{had been assigned to}} evaluate spacesuits for the MOL program. The story of the recovered spacesuits and the history of the MOL program was presented in the Public Television series NOVA episode called Astrospies which aired February 12, 2008. One spacesuit was sent to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum and the other to Florida for exhibition at the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{defending}} team 'knocks on' or touches the ball when it's in the air, {{and the ball}} is immediately regathered by the attacking team, the referee may elect to restart the tackle count in lieu of awarding a scrum; known as the zero tackle rule because the next tackle is counted as 'tackle zero' and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> 'tackle one'. The zero tackle rule cannot {{be used in a}} set that was started by the zero tackle rule. On awarding the zero tackle rule, the referee will shout [...] "Back to zero!" [...] or [...] "Six again", and wave one arm over his head with fingers clenched into a fist, indicating the attacking side's next tackle is tackle zero. If a player collects the ball directly from an opposition kick in general play, the first time he is tackled does not register on the tackle count. If the receiving player kicks or passes the ball prior to being tackled then this does not apply.|$|E
