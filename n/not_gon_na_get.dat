6000|$|He {{walked down}} to Callerfoot, refusing the loan of the Colonel's pony carriage, and thence had himself carried across the lake in a hired boat to a place called Sandy's Quay. That, he was assured, was the spot {{on the other side}} from whence the nearest road would be found to Glenbogie. But nobody on the Callerfoot side could tell him what would be the distance. At Sandy's Quay he was assured that it was twelve miles to Glenbogie House; but he soon found that the man who told him had a pony for hire. [...] "Ye'll <b>nae</b> <b>get</b> there under twalve mile,--or maybe saxteen, if ye attampt to walk up the glin." [...] So said the owner of the pony. But milder {{information}} came to him speedily. A little boy would show him the way up the glen for sixpence, and engage to bring him to the house in an hour and a half. So he started with the little boy, and after a hot scramble for about two hours he found himself within the demesne. Poking their way up through thick bushes from a ravine, they showed their two heads,--first the boy and then the sculptor,--close {{by the side of the}} private road,--just as Sir Thomas was passing, mounted on his cob. [...] "It's his ain sell," [...] said the boy, dropping his head again amongst the bushes.|$|R

40|$|Non-innocent ligands are a {{hot topic}} in {{homogeneous}} catalysis, due to their attractive ability of storing and releasing electrons during the catalytic cycle, conferring noble character to first row transition metals. In this work, a comprehensive overview of the redox active ligand bis(methyl benzimidazolyl) ketone and its Fe complex is presented. The electronic properties of the ligand and the complex, were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). They {{were found to be}} quasi-reversible, with a reduction potential of - 1. 75 V and - 1. 08 V, respectively. The complex showed a ligand-centred reduction. Electronic behaviours of the ligand and complex were probed also with scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), and the positions of their LUMO were identified at 2. 07 V and 1. 15 V. CV and STS data for the free ligand were compared, showing agreement in the results. The reduction of the ligand was further studied by actually reducing it with <b>Na(s),</b> <b>getting</b> to a doubly and a singly reduced species. These species were both analysed with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). The unpaired electron was found to be delocalized over the aromatic system of the ligand. The complex was synthesised on surface via lateral manipulation of single molecules and individual iron atoms. Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) on the complex, showed signals due to frustrated external vibrations of the molecule. IETS features on the Fe position may be related to Kondo resonance or convolution of substrate-ligand vibrations...|$|R

Water with Ca and Mg gets more precipitated {{and as a result}} <b>Na</b> in water <b>gets</b> increased in the form of sodium carbonate. The variation in RSC was drawn using (Richards 1954) good, medium and bad categories; 90  % of the samples in alluvium fall in the good category, 6.4  % in the medium category and 3.2  % in the bad category (Table  5). Good category is found in all other formations except in Other Tertiary, where 86  % are in good and 14  % in medium category.|$|R
30|$|For {{preparing}} the suspensions containing graphene or graphene oxide nanosheets (GONs), the traditional strategy is a three-step method. First, graphene or graphene oxide nanosheets are prepared and dried, {{and then they}} will be modified. Finally, the functionalized graphene will be dispersed in solvents under stir or ultrasonication. The three-step method is used widely, while there are some drawbacks. First of all, during the synthetic and drying process, GONs have the strong trend to conglomerate due to the large surface area. Second, <b>not</b> all the <b>GONs</b> can be modified, and there is always some sediment under the bottom of suspension. The suspension is not homogeneous, which is not desired for preparing even films and composite materials. Here, we developed a facile phase-transfer method with high efficiency to prepare stable suspensions of graphene oxide in organic solvents. This method is primarily based on the strong interaction between GONs and oleylamine.|$|R

40|$|The polyol pathway is a two-step {{metabolic}} pathway in which glucose {{is reduced to}} sorbitol, which is then converted to fructose. It {{is one of the}} most attractive candidate mechanisms to explain, at least in part, the cellular toxicity of diabetic hyperglycemia because (i) it becomes active when intracellular glucose concentrations are elevated, (ii) the two enzymes are present in human tissues and organs that are sites of diabetic complications, and (iii) the products of the pathway and the altered balance of cofactors generate the types of cellular stress that occur at the sites of diabetic complications. Inhibition (or ablation) of aldose reductase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway, reproducibly prevents diabetic retinopathy in diabetic rodent models, but the results of a major clinical trial have been disappointing. Since then, it has become evident that truly informative indicators of polyol pathway activity and/or inhibition are elusive, but are likely to be other than sorbitol levels if meant to predict accurately tissue consequences. The spectrum of abnormalities known to occur in human diabetic retinopathy has enlarged to include glial and neuronal abnormalities, which in experimental animals are mediated by the polyol pathway. The endothelial cells of human retinal vessels have been noted to have aldose reductase. Specific polymorphisms in the promoter region of the aldose reductase gene have been found associated with susceptibility or progression of diabetic retinopathy. This new knowledge has rekindled interest in a possible role of the polyol pathway in diabetic retinopathy and in methodological investigation that may prepare new clinical trials. Only new drugs that inhibit aldose reductase with higher efficacy and safety than older drugs will make possible to learn if the resilience of the polyol pathway means that it has a role in human diabetic retinopathy that should <b>not</b> have <b>gon...</b>|$|R

Chu Ju eventually writes a letter in protest of their unfair treatment, since {{she is the only}} one who knows how to write (her parents paid for her schooling, even though girls didn't normally receive educations). The girls are treated somewhat better, but Chu Ju loses her job. Subsequently, Chu Ju meets a woman named Han <b>Na</b> and <b>gets</b> a job helping her with her rice paddies. Han Na comes to love Chu Ju as a daughter, so when she dies, Han Na leaves land for Chu Ju. Four years after she secretly left home, Chu Ju decides to go home to visit her family. Her parents are overjoyed to see her. Chu Ju is relieved to see that her little sister, Hua, is safe and was not sent away. Chu Ju's mother has also had another baby when she was away. She gave birth to another girl named Nu Hai, but this one is going to stay in their family, even if it means they will break tradition because there will be no son in their family. After Chu Ju's visit with her family, Chu Ju goes back to her rice paddies determined to save up money to pay for her sisters' educations.|$|R
