40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To study leadership factors and their associations with psychosocial work environmental among nursing assistants who {{are engaged in}} old age care and to analyse (i) differences {{in the assessment of}} leadership factors and the assessment of psychosocial work environmental in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> help services <b>and</b> (ii) the association between the psychosocial work environment and factors that are related to leadership in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> help services. Background Leadership factors are an important element of the psychosocial work environment in old age care. The physical distance between leaders and nursing assistants is larger in home help services than in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> Therefore, it is important to study leadership separately in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> help services. Design Assessments from 844 nursing assistants in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> 288 in <b>home</b> help services (45 <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> 21 <b>home</b> help service units) were analysed. Methods The data were analysed using linear regression. Age, gender, number of staff at the unit, number of years at the current working unit and educational level were controlled in Model 1. Summarised indexes that were based on all independent variables except the main independent variable were additionally controlled in Model 2. Results Psychosocial work environment was related to leadership factors, but stronger associations occurred more frequently in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> than in home help services. Empowering leadership, support from superiors, the primacy of human resources and control over decisions were associated with higher assessments on all the variables that were related to the psychosocial work environment in both the <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> help services. Conclusions Organisational differences in conducting leadership in old age care must be considered. Some leadership characteristics are better prerequisites for creating and maintaining a positive psychosocial work environment for nursing assistants in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> help services. Implications for practice Due to the differences in organisational settings, {{it is important to consider}} the differences in prerequisites in conducting leadership.

40|$|Objective To {{estimate}} {{and compare}} the prevalence and incidence of delirium and its risk factors in residents of Dutch <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> residential care <b>homes.</b> Methods Data were extracted from the Long-Term Care Facility (inter RAI-LTCF) version of the Resident Assessment Instrument, which was filled in a routine care cohort {{for a total of}} 3627 residents. 828 residents of six <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> 1365 residents of 23 residential homes were included in the analyses. Delirium was defined as a positive score on the adjusted Nursing Home-CAM. Results The prevalence of delirium was 8. 9 % in the <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> 8. 2 % in the residential homes. The incidence was highest in the <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> with 20. 7 versus 14. 6 per 100 person-years. Multivariate tests of risk factors for developing delirium included chair restraints (OR 2. 3; 95 % CI 1. 27 - 4. 28), dementia (odds ratio (OR) 3. 3; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 03 - 5. 24) and Parkinson's disease (OR 2. 3; 95 % CI 0. 96 - 5. 63) for residents in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> dementia (OR 1. 8; 95 % CI 1. 31 - 2. 55) and fall incidents (OR 1. 7; 95 % CI 1. 20 - 2. 48) for residents in residential care homes. Conclusion The prevalence and incidence of delirium was high in both <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> residential care <b>homes.</b> More focus on modifiable risk factors {{such as the use of}} restraints in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> fall incidents in residential care homes may help to prevent delirium.

40|$|Introduction. Municipal eldercare is {{increasingly}} multifaceted. First line managers in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> help services {{are responsible for}} personnel, budget and processes. The resources and work conditions of these managers have changed over time. The first line manager is often responsible not only for economic but also for quality development of their unit. Research focusing on first line management within municipal eldercare is lacking in specific contexts, for example, research on leadership in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> help services. Aims. The aim of this thesis is to study and analyze perceptions of leadership in eldercare. The main objective is to analyze differences in leaders’ and nursing assistants’ perceptions of leadership in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> help services, <b>and</b> to study leadership factors and their associations with psychosocial work environment among nursing assistants who are engaged in eldercare. Design and methods. This thesis is based on two studies, and uses cross-sectional data from two different surveys: the Developmental Leadership Questionnaire, DLQ (Larsson, 2006 a) and a Questionnaire for Psychological and Social factors at Work, QPS, (Dallner, et al., 2000). Assessments from 21 leaders and 95 nursing assistants in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> help services were analyzed in study I. Assessments from 1132 nursing assistants in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> in <b>home</b> help services (n= 844 <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> n= 288, <b>home</b> help service units) were analyzed in article II. The data were analyzed with descriptive and analytic statistics. Results. Nursing assistants in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> assessed their leaders to be more controlling and observant than <b>nursing</b> assistants in <b>home</b> help services. According the leaders self assessment, leaders in home help services were less successful at being supportive, being a good example, and promoting creativity than leaders in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> Psychosocial work environment was related to leadership factors, but stronger associations occurred more frequently in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> than in home help services. The leadership factors empowering leadership, support from superiors, focus on human resources and control over decisions were associated with better results on all the variables that {{were related to the}} psychosocial work environment in both <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> in <b>home</b> help services. Conclusions and implications for practice. Organisational differences in conducting leadership in old age care must be considered. Some leadership characteristics are better conditions for creating and maintaining a positive psychosocial work environment for nursing assistants in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> help services. Due to the differences in organisational settings, {{it is important to consider}} the differences in conditions for conducting leadership. To influence nursing assistants’ performance and to increase quality in eldercare in the long term, appropriate leadership is necessary. Therefore, it is important for the leaders to provide support in work, help to develop skills, encourage employees to participate in important decisions, and show interest in nursing assistants’ well-being. Also, the leaders might benefit if they reduce the specialisation of work, which counteracts the possibility to have variation in work in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> help services. In particular, <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> should benefit if they reduce the amount of role conflicts, and if nursing assistants receive reasonable quantitative work demands. The municipality eldercare should take into account the organisational differences in conducting leadership in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in relation to home help services. Recruiting leaders with characteristics that are desirable in the specific context will create better conditions for a good psychosocial work environment in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> help services...|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the center joined with Harvard Medical School to provide {{surgical}} training and also provided residencies for graduates of Dartmouth Medical School. The aging veteran population in New Hampshire {{led to the}} addition of a residential <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> an ambulatory care wing in the late 1970s. Over the years several medical research centers were established, including one for post-traumatic stress disorder. The center originally had a 28-bed full-service hospital. Starting in 1999 the center eliminated its inpatient care services, and the center concentrated on urgent and primary care and on ambulatory and outpatient services. Following the closure, patients requiring a full-service hospital were sent to VA hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, and White River Junction, Vermont. The center also established in-patient treatment contracts with non-VA hospitals in New Hampshire such as Concord Hospital.|$|E

25|$|Athelstane, {{owned by}} W.G. Judd, was a notable {{home in the}} district. The large house gave {{its name to the}} avenue it was built on and later became the site of Athelstane Public School. Another main street, Barden Street, was named after Frederick Barden whose house, Highbery Heights, stood nearby. Arncliffe had many grand and gracious Victorian era houses. Too many have been demolished, or fallen into disrepair, been {{subdivided}} and so on, but in the most recent years there have been some attempts to preserve these as part of local heritage. Two-storey semi-detached dwellings, Gladstone and Wentworth on Forest Road, were built by Hurstville builder Robert Newell for rental to 'well to do' tenants. Dappeto on Wollongong Road built in 1885 by oyster merchant Frederick Gibbins, later became a home for children and now houses a Salvation Army chapel, as part of a <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> retirement village. 'Belmont' and 'Fairview' are identical Victorian homes built in 1884 by two Irish brothers Thomas and Alexander Milsop, who made their fortunes in the goldfields. 'Meryton' was erected by building contractor Alexander Fell in 1885. 'Coburra' was built in 1905 but was more typical of the earlier Victorian era. Arncliffe Post office is a Federation style building opened in 1906 and originally contained the post master's residence upstairs.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, Benefis {{sought to}} stop the Great Falls Clinic from {{purchasing}} 20-bed Central Montana Surgical Hospital. The clinic had partnered with Essentia Health, a non-profit healthcare system based in Minnesota and North Dakota, to purchase Harold Poulsen's outstanding stock in Central Montana Surgical Hospital and gain a controlling interest in the surgical hospital. Benefis sued to prevent the transaction, arguing that the new owners intended to run the facility as a specialty hospital in contravention of a 2005 state law banning further construction {{of these types of}} facilities and that the Clinic and Essentia did not apply for the required health care facility license. The health system won a temporary restraining order. Benefis also said it stood to lose $4 million a year in revenues if Central Montana Surgical Hospital was licensed as a general hospital. The company said it would likely close its renal dialysis unit, suspend Mercy Flights, shutter its <b>nursing</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> end outpatient psychiatric and chemical dependency services. Benefis also said it would lose several million dollars a year in federal payments as well. On March 24, the injunction was lifted. Benefis filed an emergency motion with the Montana Supreme Court three days later, appealing the district court's ruling. The state of Montana then issued a six-month provisional license to Central Montana to operate as a general hospital. But on October 4, 2006, the Montana Supreme Court ruled 4-to-3 to uphold the district court's dismissal of the temporary injunction. However, the state supreme court declined to rule on other issues raised by Benefis' lawsuit, and left open the door for the company to continue litigation in the district courts. On November 6, 2006, Benefis declined to appeal the high court's ruling and said it would not bring the other issues back to the district court. In February 2007, the Clinic sued Benefis to recover its legal fees. A state judge ruled in September 2007 that Benefis must pay these fees.|$|E
