40|$|Suppose that a {{sequence}} of treatments are assigned to influence an outcome of interest that occurs after the last treatment. Between treatments there exist time-dependent covariates that may be posttreatment variables of the earlier treatments and confounders of the subsequent treatments. In this article, we develop a parametric approach to inference <b>of</b> the causal <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the treatment sequence on the outcome called the sequential causal effect. We construct a point parametrization for the conditional distribution of an outcome given all treatments and time-dependent covariates, in which the point parameters of interest are the point <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments considered as single-point treatments. We (1) identify <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments by point <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments, (2) express patterns <b>of</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments by constraints on point <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments, and (3) show that all sequential causal effects are determined by <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments. Accordingly we (1) estimate <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments through point <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments by maximum likelihood, (2) improve the estimation by constraints on point <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments and assignment conditions of treatments, and (3) use the estimates <b>of</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> treatments to obtain those <b>of</b> sequential causal <b>effects.</b> As a result, we obtain unbiased consistent maximum-likelihood estimates <b>of</b> sequential causal <b>effects</b> even for long treatment sequences.

5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E

5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand the <b>net</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E

40|$|How {{often and}} when have fall presidential general {{election}} campaigns {{during the past}} 50 years been decisive in determining which presidential candidate would receive the plurality of the national popular vote? This article addresses these questions {{using data from the}} Gallup Poll, the National Election Studies, and actual election returns for the 14 presidential elections from 1948 to 2000. Based on an analysis of four measures <b>of</b> <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> general election campaigns from after the national party conventions until election day, there is some evidence of campaigns being decisive in 5 of the 14 elections examined. Campaigns after the conventions were probably decisive in two elections, the 1948 and 1960 contests, and possibly made the difference in the outcomes of the 1976, 1980, and 2000 elections. A conservative estimate is that campaigns conducted after the conventions have probably been decisive in about a quarter of presidential elections since 1948. Presidential general election campaigns matter to the national division of the vote. Even claims that the <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> campaigns are small do not deny that campaigns have at least “minimal effects” (Finkel, 1993; Klapper, 1960; Lazarsfeld, Berelson, & Gaudet, 1944) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{proposition}} that widespread gun ownership {{serves as a}} deterrent to residential burglary is widely touted by advocates, but the evidence is weak, consisting of anecdotes, interviews with burglars, casual comparisons with other countries, and the like. A more systematic exploration requires data on local rates of gun ownership and of residential burglary, and such data have only recently become available. In this paper we exploit a new well-validated proxy for local gun-ownership prevalence [...] the proportion of suicides that involve firearms [...] together with newly available geo-coded data from the National Crime Victimization Survey, to produce the first systematic estimates <b>of</b> the <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> gun prevalence on residential burglary patterns. The importance of such empirical work stems in part from the fact that theoretical considerations do not provide much guidance in predicting the <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> widespread gun ownership. Guns in the home may pose a threat to burglars, but also serve as an inducement, since guns are particularly valuable loot. Other things equal, a gun-rich community provides more lucrative burglary opportunities than one where guns are more sparse. The new empirical results reported here provide no support for a <b>net</b> deterrent <b>effect</b> from widespread gun ownership. Rather, our analysis concludes that residential burglary rates tend to increase with community gun prevalence. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{considers the}} <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> {{the tax system}} complexity in Australia, at the federal government level. The <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> tax system complexity have been defined as both the short- and long-term <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> tax operating costs on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Since annual estimates of tax compliance costs from empirical studies are not available, an alternative method to estimate tax compliance costs must first be provided. A state space and Kalman filter model was employed to estimate a series of annual percentage changes in tax system complexity. A series of annual tax compliance costs can then be generated based on tax compliance survey results for 1995 (Evans et al. 1997) and the assumption that tax system complexity fundamentally explains why tax compliance costs change over time. A vector error-correction model (VECM) was constructed to analyse the <b>net</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> tax system complexity given that VECM can estimate short- and long-term relationships simultaneously. A series of tax compliance costs for the period between financial years 1965  66 and 2011  12, was generated. The simulated data show that tax system complexity is highly persistent. Tax operating costs {{were found to have}} a negative effect on the gross domestic product (GDP) in the long run. It was estimated that a 1 % increase in real tax operating costs can lead to a 0. 122 % decrease in real GDP in the long run. The short-term relationships tax operating costs and the GDP were simulated based on the VECM. An initial decline in the GDP in response to an increased tax operating costs was evident and was followed by a steady recovery. Approximately seven years after the initial shock, the increase in tax operating costs can contribute to the GDP growth, but this positive relationship slowly dissolved over time. Finally, it was found that tax revenue had a slow diminishing tendency, which suggests that existing tax laws eventually become ineffective in raising revenue...|$|R

Among 139 wetlands, nonnative fish (bass, sunfish, and mosquitofish) negatively influenced the probability of occupancy of Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla), but neither invader correlated strongly with occupancy by California newts (Taricha torosa), western toads (Anaxyrus boreas), or California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii). In mesocosms, mosquitofish dramatically reduced the abundance of zooplankton and palatable amphibian larvae (P. regilla and T. torosa), leading to increases in nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton (through loss of zooplankton), and rapid growth of unpalatable toad larvae (through competitive release).
