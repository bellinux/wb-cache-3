40|$|The air {{permeability}} of 8 standard <b>nylon</b> parachute <b>cloths</b> was determined, using samples 6. 05 in. in effective diameter. Fifty-nine experimental <b>nylon</b> <b>cloths</b> manu-factured by the Bally Ribbon Mills {{were subjected to}} the same test procedure, as were 2 experimental fabrics of Orlon and Dacron, and 4 different samples of wire screen. Upon assuming that the pressure gradient in the flow through a parachute fabric {{is proportional to the}} arithmetic sum of an inertial (&beta;&rho;&upsi; 2) and the viscous contribution (&alpha;&mu;&upsi;), the existence of a parameter, &beta;/&alpha; (whose measure is length), can be inferred. This length can be employed to characterize the geometry of the cloth. Experimental work to date {{in the case of the}} 8 standard <b>nylon</b> <b>cloths,</b> the Orlon and Dacron fabrics, 14 of the Bally Ribbon cloths, and the 4 wire screen samples indicates a justification of the assumption. Employing the characteristic length so determined permits writing a single relation common to all cloths between a "flow-through-drag coefficient, " Cr, and a Reynolds num-ber based on the characteristic length, viz., Cf = 2 + (2 /NRe). A procedure is suggested for estimating the parameters &alpha; and &beta; from physical meas-urements for plain-weave cloth; thus an indication of the permeability is predicted from construction details of the fabric...|$|R

5000|$|A doormat or door-mat is a flat, usually rectangular, object placed {{immediately}} {{outside or}} inside {{the entrance to}} a house or other building, to allow people to easily scrub or wipe the soles of their shoes before entering. Doormats are usually made from tough, long-lasting material such as coir, palmyra (palm) fibres and stalks, <b>nylon,</b> rubber, <b>cloth,</b> or aluminium and other metals. A doormat may also be known as a welcome mat, as its location at an entrance constitutes a [...] "welcome" [...] to visitors, and may therefore also bear some word, message or sign of greeting. This in turn has given rise to a subculture of cartoons featuring characters returning home to find (to the reader) a humorous message on the doormat. The lowly purpose for which doormats exist has also led to informal use of the term as a reference to people who behave timidly or passively when exploited by others (see also Caspar Milquetoast).|$|R
5000|$|A sauna suit is {{a garment}} made from {{waterproof}} fabric {{designed to make}} the wearer sweat profusely. A sauna suit is sometimes called a [...] "rubber suit" [...] because the early types were made of rubber or rubberized cloth. Now, sauna suits are typically made of PVC or coated <b>nylon</b> <b>cloth.</b> The construction is typically {{in the style of}} a waterproof sweat suit, consisting of a pullover jacket and drawstring pants. The closures at waist, neck, wrists and ankles are all elasticated to help retain body heat and moisture within the garment. In some sauna suits, the jacket also includes a hood to provide additional retention of body heat.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} provide {{protection}} against high velocity bullets, the PASGT vest was, in 1996, combined with the Interim Small Arms Protective Overvest (ISAPO) pending the adoption of Interceptor body armor. The ISAPO weighed about 16.5 lb and consisted of a carrier to hold two protective ceramic plate inserts. A PASGT armor system with overvest weighed more than 25 lb and was criticized by many U.S. troops as unacceptably cumbersome in combat. The ballistic fill consists of 13 plies of 14 oz. water repellent treated Aramid (Kevlar 29) fabric. The inner and outer cover, shoulder pads and front closure flap of the vest are water repellent treated 8 oz. ballistic <b>nylon</b> <b>cloth.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cover, Water Canteen - The water canteen {{cover is}} {{fabricated}} of <b>nylon</b> <b>cloth</b> and webbing and acrylic pile liner material.

The lid of this small pocket is secured by means of hook and pile fastener tape. The cover attaches to the individual equipment belt by means of two belt-strap keepers with interlocking slides. The water canteen cover is designed to accommodate the Canteen, Water (NSN 8465-00-889-3477). In 1975, the LC-1 designation for the water canteen cover is changed to LC-2 due to some minor design changes. The National Stock Number remains the same.|$|E

40|$|Published online: 02 Mar 2015 A {{rapid and}} reagent-free method for {{measuring}} soil sand content is presented. In this method, a 20 -µm-opening <b>nylon</b> mesh <b>cloth</b> {{was used for}} wet sieving of the sand fraction, and the difference of the soil weight before and after sieving was measured with an electric balance. Once air-dried, 2 -mm sieved samples are prepared, the analysis can be completed within 2 d and 50 samples can be handled together by one person. The accuracy of this method was evaluated using five agricultural surface soils with various textural classes. The sand content obtained from the proposed method agreed well with that from the conventional method. Repeatability and reproducibility of the proposed method were high for sandy soils and were moderate for a clayey soil. The sensitivity of the method was further evaluated by analyzing 100 surface soils collected from a single paddy field having a similar textural class. The regression analysis of data between the proposed and conventional methods yielded an R 2 value of 0. 83 and a slope of 1. 04. The slight overestimation by the proposed method suggested a systematic error, originating probably {{from the lack of}} pretreatment to remove organic matter. Limited to agricultural soils containing total carbon (C) of less than 5 %, the proposed method would be useful not only for scientific investigation but also for educational purposes...|$|R
40|$|Different {{materials}} {{have been used}} to fabricate summer (warm environment) clothing, such as cotton, nylon, neoprene, polyester and 100 % synthetic fibers. However, because of their mechanical and thermal properties, <b>nylon</b> and polyester <b>cloth</b> has a tendency to rot and chafe in damp conditions. In addition, close-fitting synthetic fibers and neoprene make some wearers feel uncomfortable because of the rapidly occurring body skin sweat. However, bamboo and cotton have demonstrated to have low thermal conductivity. Hence, they are excellent materials to fabricate summer clothing. In this study, a theoretical analysis complemented with practical measurements of thermal properties of three different rib knitted structures produced from a 30 tex yarn of three blends of fibers (100 % regenerated bamboo, 100 % cotton and 50 : 50 regenerated bamboo: cotton) was realized to compare bamboo and cotton performance in warm environment. Obtained results show that garment thickness and heat storage rate in the human body can significantly be reduced by using 100 % regenerated bamboo, without compromising comfort...|$|R

5000|$|This was {{the first}} mission to have an {{insignia}} patch. After Gemini 3, NASA banned astronauts from naming their spacecraft. Cooper, having realized {{he had never been}} in a military organization without one, suggested a mission patch to symbolize the flight. NASA agreed, and the patches got the generic name of [...] "Cooper patch." [...] Cooper chose the image of a covered wagon due to the pioneering nature of the flight. The slogan [...] "8 Days or Bust" [...] was emblazoned across the wagon, but NASA managers objected to this, feeling it placed too much emphasis on the mission length and not the experiments, and fearing the public might see the mission as a failure if it did not last the full duration. A piece of <b>nylon</b> <b>cloth</b> was sewn over the slogan.|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{nitrogen}} and phosphorus loading from municipal wastewater treatment plants is an ongoing threat to water quality, which leads to more stringent environmental regulations in different countries. Microalgal mediated twin-layer system offers an interesting alternative for {{nitrogen and}} phosphorus removal since it provides a treatment to remove both nutrients efficiently coupled with the production of potentially valuable biomass. In the twin-layer system, microalgae are immobilized by self-adhesion on a wet, microporous, ultrathin substrate (the substrate layer). Subtending the substrate layer, a second layer, consisting of a macroporous fibrous material (the source layer), provides the growth medium. Twin-layer effectively separate microalgae from {{the bulk of their}} growth medium, yet allow diffusion of nutrients. <b>Nylon</b> filter <b>cloth</b> and glass grid reinforced lamina were selected as the suitable substrate and source layer for twin-layer system, respectively. Immobilized green algae Scenedesmus rubescens and Chlamydomonas terricola showed highest biomass productivities among 23 algae supplied by synthetic secondary wastewater and were recommended for wastewater treatment in general. Removal of {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} from the real municipal wastewater by S. rubescens was investigated. During 54 days, S. rubescens grew well (1. 05 g dry weight m- 2 day- 1), remained immobilized and removed phosphorus, nitrate and ammonium efficiently from four types of wastewater within short retention time (1 - 2 days), e. g. the residual phosphate-P was < 0. 22 mg l- 1 and nitrate-N was < 2 mg l- 1 within one day in the secondary settled wastewater. Three scenarios were proposed on integrating twin-layer system into wastewater treatment plants. In one of the three, removing phosphorus and ammonium from 100 m 3 primary settled wastewater to meet the discharge requirement i. e. <= 1 mg l- 1 P will need a minimal ground area of greenhouse of about 1369 m 2 and 16. 6 kWh electricity daily. It is concluded that immobilization of S. rubescens on twin-layers is an effective means to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the wastewater. More efforts should be focus on the selection of microalgae and co-immobilization of microalgae with microalgae/other microorganisms to reduce organic substances...|$|R
