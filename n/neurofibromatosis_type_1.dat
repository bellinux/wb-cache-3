40|$|The {{outcome of}} {{acoustic}} neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) surgery continues to improve rapidly.

The affected adults showed, at the ages of 32, 37, 38, and 61, respectively, multiple spinal neurofibromas symmetrically affecting all spinal roots. Two patients were operated on for histopathologically proven cervical spinal neurofibromas.

40|$|Schwannomas are {{peripheral}} nerve sheath tumors that often {{occur in the}} setting of an inherited tumor predisposition syndrome, including <b>Neurofibromatosis</b> <b>Types</b> <b>1</b> (NF 1) and 2 (NF 2), Familial Schwannomatosis (FS) and Carney Complex (CNC). Loss of the NF 2 tumor suppressor (encoding NF 2, or Merlin) is associated with upregulation of the Rac 1 small GTPase, which is thought to {{play a key role in}} mediating tumor formation. In prior studies, we generated a mouse model of schwannomas by performing tissue-specific knockout of the CNC gene Prkar 1 a, which encodes the <b>type</b> <b>1</b> A regulatory subunit of Protein Kinase A. These tumors exhibited down-regulation of Nf 2 protein and an increase in activated Rac 1. To assess the requirement for Rac 1 in schwannoma formation, we generated a double knockout of Prkar 1 a and Rac 1 in Schwann cells and monitored tumor formation. Loss of Rac 1 reduced tumor formation by reducing proliferation and enhancing apoptosis. Surprisingly, the reduction of tumor formation was accompanied by re-expression of the Nf 2 protein. Furthermore, activated Rac 1 was able to downregulate Nf 2 in vitro in a Pak-dependent manner. These in vivo data indicate that activation of Rac 1 is responsible for suppression of Nf 2 protein production; deficiency of Nf 2 in Schwann cells leads to loss of cellula...|$|R

The meeting also features rare tumors such as glioma, meningioma, sarcoma, and neuroblastoma that occur both within these syndromes and spontaneously; associated with somatic mutations in NF 1, NF 2, and SWN. The meeting addresses both state of the field for current clinical care as well as emerging preclinical models fueling discovery of new therapeutic targets and discovery science initiatives investigating mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Importantly, this conference is a forum for presenting work in progress and bringing together all stakeholders in the scientific community. A highlight of the conference was the involvement of scientists from the pharmaceutical industry who presented growing efforts for rare disease therapeutic development in general and specifically, in pediatric patients with rare tumor syndromes.

40|$|<b>Neurofibromatosis</b> <b>types</b> <b>1</b> and 2 are {{inherited}} neurocutaneous disorders {{characterized by}} a variety of manifestations that involve the circulatory system, the central and peripheral nervous systems, the skin, and the skeleton. Significant reduction in lifespan occurs in both conditions often related to complications of malignancy and hypertension. Individuals with these conditions may also be the subject of medicolegal autopsy investigation if sudden death occurs. Unexpected lethal events may be associated with intracranial neoplasia and hemorrhage or brainstem compression. Vasculopathy with fibrointimal proliferation may result in critical reduction in blood flow within the coronary or cerebral circulations, and aneurysmal dilatation may be associated with rupture and life-threatening hemorrhage. An autopsy approach to potential cases should include review of the history/hospital record, liaison with a clinical geneticist (to include family follow-up), a full external examination with careful documentation of skin lesions and nodules, measurement of the head circumference in children, photography, possible radiologic examination, a standard internal autopsy examination, documentation of the effects of previous surgery and/or chemo/radiotherapy, examination for specific tumors, specific examination and sampling of vasculature (renal, cerebral, and cardiac), formal neuropathologic examination of brain and spinal cord, possible examination of the eyeballs, examination of the gastrointestinal tract, histology to include tumors, vessels, gut, and bone marrow, toxicological testing for anticonvulsants, and sampling of blood and tissue for possible cytogenetic/molecular evaluation if required.
