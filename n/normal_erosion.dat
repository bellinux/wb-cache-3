On the tectonically stable and frequently modified Dhanjori Highlands (southwest of Singhbhum Shear Zone, copper belt) rivers like Sankh, Netra, Sarujharna, Jou, Gara etc. crave out several geomorphic architects (youthold phase) which signify the variable intensity of fluvial erosion. Having different magnitude of rock résistance and spatial variability of forest cover, the monsoonal wetdry type of climate plays a crucial role in hillslope erosion and channel erosion. The present article emphasizes on the spatial distribution and quantification of fluvial erosion taking drainage basins and slope facets as an ideal geomorphic unit.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether the accelerated replicative senescence seen in Werner syndrome (WS) fibroblasts is due to accelerated telomere loss per cell division. Using single telomere length analysis (STELA) we show that the mean rate of telomere shortening in WS bulk cultures ranges between that of normal fibroblasts [99 bp/population doubling (PD) ] and four times that of normal (355 bp/PD). The telomere erosion rate in the fastest eroding strain slows in the later stages of culture to that observed in normal fibroblasts, and appears to be correlated with a reduction in the heterogeneity of the telomere-length distributions. Telomere erosion rates in clones of WS cells are much reduced compared with bulk cultures, as are the variances of the telomere-length distributions. The overall lack of length heterogeneity and the <b>normal</b> <b>erosion</b> rates of the clonal populations are consistent with simple end-replication losses as the major contributor to telomere erosion in WS cells. We propose that telomere dynamics at the single cell level in WS fibroblasts are not significantly different from those in normal fibroblasts, and suggest that the accelerated replicative decline seen in WS fibroblasts does not result from accelerated telomere erosion...|$|E

[Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]This research assesses the morphological consequences of recent (post-???Little Ice Age???) paraglacial reworking of valley-side sediment mantles in the European Alps. It aims to identify the extent and conditioning factors of slope adjustment at sites in the Swiss Alps, model the temporal pattern, and assess the rates of sediment reworking involved. Gully systems have cut into steep, high-level lateral moraines, and debris cones have accumulated downslope. Debris flow is the dominant agent of sediment transfer. Factors controlling the extent of this activity include moraine slope gradient, relief and moisture availability. Gullies appear to have reached their maximum dimensions within ca. 50 ???yr of deglaciation, after which gully relief is reduced by removal of inter-gully slopes and gully infilling (within 80 ??? 140 ???yr). On the most recently deglaciated terrain, minimum erosion rates average ca. 95 ???mm???yr??? 1 since gully initiation, greatly exceeding ???<b>normal???</b> <b>erosion</b> rates in other environments.

30|$|Soil erosion is {{a natural}} {{landscape}} process that, {{in the absence of}} catastrophic disturbance, proceeds in a linear or slightly linear trajectory (DeBano et al. 1998, 2005). High severity wildland fires provide the ecosystem stress that can push <b>normal</b> soil <b>erosion</b> across a threshold of irreversibility that leads to desertification and loss of ecosystem productivity (Davenport et al. 1998). The factors that determine whether soil erosion rates will cross a threshold in response to wildland fire include site erosion potential, which is a function of climate; geomorphology and soil erodibility; ground cover; soil disturbance history; soil type and horizon characteristics; and magnitude of disturbance. Mega-fires provide the stressor that can lead to soil erosion crossing a tolerance threshold and accelerating desertification.|$|R
40|$|Fluvial erosion on Mars {{has been}} {{nonuniform}} in both time and space. Viking orbiter images reveal {{a variety of}} different aged terrains exhibiting widely different degrees of erosion. Based on our terrestrial analog studies, rates of fluvial erosion associated with the formation of many of the valleys on Mars is probably on the order of hundreds of meters per million years, while rates of erosion associated with the formation of the outflow channels probably ranged from tens to hundreds of meters in several weeks to months. However, estimated rates of erosion of the Martian surface at the Viking Lander sites are extremely low, on the order of 1 micron/yr or less. At most this would result in a meter of material removed per million years, and it is unlikely that such an erosion rate would be able to produce the degree of geomorphic work required to form the fluvial features present elsewhere on the surface. In addition, single terrain units are not eroded uniformly by fluvial processes. Instead fluvial valleys, particularly in the cratered highlands, typically are situated in clusters surrounded by vast expanses of uneroded surfaces of the same apparent lithologic, structural, and hydrological setting. Clearly throughout its geologic history, Mars has experienced a nonuniformity in erosion rates. By estimating the amount of fluvial erosion on dissected terrains and by studying the spatial distribution of those locations which have experienced above <b>normal</b> <b>erosion</b> rates, {{it should be possible to}} place further constraints on Mars' paleoclimatic history...|$|E
40|$|In nature, {{several types}} of landforms have simple shapes: as they evolve they tend to take on an ideal, simple {{geometric}} form such as a cone, an ellipsoid or a paraboloid. Volcanic landforms are possibly {{the best examples of}} this ?ideal? geometry, since they develop as regular surface features due to the point-like (circular) or fissure-like (linear) manifestation of volcanic activity. In this paper, we present a geomorphometric method of fitting the ?ideal? surface onto the real surface of regular-shaped volcanoes through a number of case studies (Mt. Mayon, Mt. Somma, Mt. Semeru, and Mt. Cameroon). Volcanoes with circular, as well as elliptical, symmetry are addressed. For the best surface fit, we use the minimization library MINUIT which is made freely available by the CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). This library enables us to handle all the available surface data (every point of the digital elevation model) in a one-step, half-automated way regardless {{of the size of the}} dataset, and to consider simultaneously all the relevant parameters of the selected problem, such as the position of the center of the edifice, apex height, and cone slope, thanks to the highly performing adopted procedure. Fitting the geometric surface, along with calculating the related error, demonstrates the twofold advantage of the method. Firstly, we can determine quantitatively to what extent a given volcanic landform is regular, i. e. how much it follows an expected regular shape. Deviations from the ideal shape due to degradation (e. g. sector collapse and <b>normal</b> <b>erosion)</b> can be used in erosion rate calculations. Secondly, if we have a degraded volcanic landform, whose geometry is not clear, this method of surface fitting reconstructs the original shape with the maximum precision. Obviously, in addition to volcanic landforms, this method is also capable of constraining the shapes of other regular surface features such as aeolian, glacial or periglacial landforms...|$|E
40|$|Stroke {{is now a}} well-recognised {{risk factor}} for hip fracture. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{elucidate}} the pathophysiological mechanisms by which hip bone loss occurs in hemiplegia and to test the efficacy of a novel pharmaceutical strategy for preserving bone in stroke patients. Patients who were admitted acutely with a first-ever stroke and who remained unable to walk one week later were studied prospectively for 12 months, with a series of bone mineral density measurements of the hips (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) in the context of a randomised controlled trial. Untreated patients (n= 13) experienced a decline in bone mineral density at the hemiplegic hip that was rapid, with the greatest losses in the trochanteric region of the affected side. This bone loss was prevented by the administration of a single 4 mg dose of the intravenous bisphosphonate, zoledronate (n= 14) within 35 days of stroke onset. Computed tomography of the hips in 8 untreated patients more than a year after stroke confirmed that the greatest difference between sides was in the trochanteric region. Serum vitamin D measurements in 44 patients with acute stroke were substantially lower than healthy elderly controls, with 77 % of patients in the insufficient range, suggesting that vitamin D insufficiency preceded stroke. Histomorphometric analysis of iliac bone biopsies from hemiplegic patients 10 weeks following stroke showed <b>normal</b> <b>erosion</b> parameters, but a striking decrease in the surface extent of osteoid when compared with healthy reference values. Unexpectedly, treatment with zoledronate was associated with a significantly higher osteoid surface compared with placebo treated subjects in cancellous, endocortical and cortical bone. Sclerostin, a newly discovered osteocyte-derived protein was studied using immunohistochemical staining of the bone biopsies. Sclerostin is known to be an inhibitor of active osteoblasts, which led to the hypothesis that in stroke, the proportion of osteocytes expressing sclerostin would be inversely associated with the surface extent of bone formation. Histological analysis revealed widespread expression of sclerostin in osteocytes and their canaliculi in all subjects. However, examining individual osteocytes in relation to bone forming surfaces revealed that newly embedded osteocytes did not express sclerostin until after primary mineralisation. It is proposed that this precise pattern and timing of sclerostin expression by osteocytes allows bone formation to continue locally (during remodelling), but prevents excessive new bone formation elsewhere, as seen in the single gene disorder sclerosteosis. 1.

Forest {{vegetation}} {{provides the}} best protection of soil against accelerated, excessive erosion. In a well preserved and properly managed forest there is no excessive erosion, only <b>normal</b> <b>erosion</b> in which the rate of soil erosion is far below the erosion tolerance. However, a severe degradation of forest ecosystems in the Mediterranean karst area of Croatia considerably diminishes their anti-erosion function. Nearly 60 % of the area is covered with coppice forests, scrub, maquis and bare ground, while high forests account for only 3. 7 %. Such an unfavourable structure of the forest fund aggravates erosion processes in this area. Of the entire Mediterranean karst areas in the Republic of Croatia covering 15, 383 km 2, about 95 % are affected by varying intensities of water-induced soil erosion, of which 40 % refer to severe erosion. Accordingly, the area is at {{a high risk of}} erosion while some of the regions are already completely degraded. In this highly vulnerable area with respect to erosion, soil degradation and vegetation devastation, as many as 668 torrents have been recorded with a total watershed amounting to 3, 024 km 2, which makes it one of the largest torrent areas in Croatia. The annual soil loss, or sediment quantites irrevocably lost to the Adriatic Sea, is estimated at 1, 140 hectares with soil layers of 20 cm. Soil, an indispensable natural resource that is painstakingly produced over long periods, makes the issue of its protection the primary concern. With this in mind, the Adriatic Culture and Karst Amelioration Institute in Split started scientific research on karst soil erosion and protection in 1964. In 1971, the first experimental plots with measuring instruments were established in torrent watersheds of the Mediterranean karst. The goal was to obtain original data on essential characteristics of water-induced soil erosion using up-to-date stationary methods. The plots are at different inclinations with varied geological and pedological characteristics and they support a diverse plant cover. The paper shows the research results of the influence of forest ecosystems of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) on surface flowoff of rainfall and protection of soil from erosion. The research was done in the mouth of the torrent Rupotine near Solin, Ku~ine, on experimental plots B 8 and B 9, in preserved and burned stands of Aleppo pine, inclination 20 ° and 26 ° in the period from August 2002 to August 2004. In preserved stands of Aleppo pine of complete stand, on inclination 26 ° (plot B 8) {{in the first year of}} research, from August 2002 to August 2003, surface flowoff amounted to 6, 23 mm/m 2, soil loss 0, 043 t/ha.

In the second year of investigation, from August 2003 to August 2004. yearly value of surface flowoff on the plot under Aleppo pine stand amounted to 4, 25 mm/m 2, soil loss 0, 00022 t/ha.

40|$|P-T conditions, {{paragenetic}} {{studies and}} the relation between mineral growth, deformation and - when possible- isograd minerals {{have been used to}} describe the type of metamorphism involved within lower units of the southern Menderes Massif of the Anatolide Belt in western Turkey. The study areas mainly consist of Proterozoic orthogneiss and surrounding schists of presumed Paleozoic age. Both units are seen as nappes in the southern study area, the Çine and the Selimiye nappe, on the whole corresponding to Proterozoic orthogneiss and surrounding schists, respectively. The Çine and Selimiye nappes are part of a complex geological structure within the core series of the Menderes Massif. Their emplacement under lower greenschist facies conditions, would result from closure of the northern Neo-Thethys branch during the Eocene. These two nappes are separated by a major tectonic structure, the Selimiye shear zone, which records top-to-the-S shearing under greenschist facies conditions. Amphibolite to upper amphibolite facies metamorphism is widely developed within the metasedimentary rocks of the Çine nappe whereas no metamorphism exceeding lower amphibolite facies has been observed in the Selimiye nappe. In the southern margin of the Çine Massif, around Selimiye and Millas villages, detailed sampling has been undertaken in order to map mineral isograds within the Selimiye nappe and to specify P-T conditions in this area. The data collected in this area reveals a global prograde <b>normal</b> <b>erosion</b> field gradient from south to north and toward the orthogneiss. The mineralogical parageneses and P-T estimates are correlated with Barrovian-type metamorphism. A jump of P-T conditions across the Selimiye shear zone has been identified and estimated c. 2 kbar and 100 °C which evidences the presence of amphibolite facies metasedimentary rocks near the orthogneiss. Metasedimentary rocks from the overlying Selimiye nappe have maximum P-T conditions of c. 4 - 5 kbar and c. 525 °C near the base of the nappe. Metasedimentary rocks from the Çine nappe underneath the Selimiye shear zone record maximum P-T conditions of about 7 kbar and > 550 °C. Kinematic indicators in both nappes consistently show a top-S shear sense. Metamorphic grade in the Selimiye nappe decreases structurally upwards as indicated by mineral isograds defining the garnet-chlorite zone at the base, the chloritoid-biotite zone and the biotite-chlorite zone {{at the top of the}} nappe. The mineral isograds in the Selimiye nappe run parallel to the regional SR foliation. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar mica ages indicate an Eocene age of metamorphism in the Selimiye nappe and underneath the Çine nappe in this area. Metasedimentary rocks of the Çine nappe 20 - 30 km north of the Selimiye shear zone record maximum P-T conditions of 8 - 11 kbar and 600 - 650 °C. Kinematic indicators show mainly top-N shear sense associated with prograde amphibolite facies metamorphism. An age of about 550 Ma could be indicated for amphibolite facies metamorphism and associated top-N shear in the orthogneiss and metasedimentary rocks of the Çine nappe. However, there is no evidence for polymetamorphism in the 6 metasedimentary rocks of the Çine nappe, making tectonic interpretations about late Neoproterozoic to Cambrian and Tertiary metamorphic events speculative. In the western margin of the Çine Massif metamorphic mineral parageneses and pressure– temperature conditions lead to similar conclusion regarding the erosion field gradient, prograde normal toward the orthogneiss. The contact between orthogneiss and surrounding metasedimentary rocks is mylonitic and syn-metamorphism. P-T estimates are those already observed within the Selimiye nappe and correlated with lower amphibolite facies parageneses. Finally additional data in the eastern part and a general paragenetic study within the Menderes Massif lower units, the Çine and the Selimiye nappes, strongly suggest a single Barrovian-type metamorphism predating Eocene emplacement of the high pressure–low temperature Lycean and Cycladic blueschist nappes. Metamorphic mineral parageneses and pressure–temperature conditions do not support the recently proposed model of high pressure–low temperature metamorphic overprinting, which implies burial of the lower units of the Menderes Massif up to depth of 30 km, as a result of closure of the Neo-Tethys. According to the geochronological problem outlined during this thesis, there are two possible schemes: either Barrovian-type metamorphism is Proterozoic in age and part of the sediments from Selimiye nappe (lower amphibolite facies) has to be proterozoic of age too, or Barrovian-type metamorphism in Eocene of age. In the first case the structure observed now in the core series would correspond to simple exhumation of Proterozoic basement. In the latter case a possible correlation with closure of Neo-Tethys (sensu stricto, southern branch) is envisaged...|$|E

Nearer the Great Lakes, the till sheets are trenched only by the narrow valleys of the large streams.

Although such islands form on fringing reefs, those that endure longest are generally found on more isolated reefs, typically barrier or atoll reefs far from the shores of higher islands.

Thus, lines of reef islands rise from submerged volcanic islands in the central western Pacific, from Tuvalu through (western) Kiribati to the Marshall Islands.

Crystallographic preferred orientation patterns in deformed quartzites reveal a decreasing simple shear component with increasing structural depth, suggesting a pure shear dominated westward flow within the subduction channel and localized simple shear along the upper channel boundary.

The experimental results reveal that the surface of GaN specimens is significantly etched and erased. An unambiguous step-up is observed. The erosion depth not only strongly depends on the charge state of ions, but also {{is related to the}} incident angle of Pbq+-ions and the ion dose. The erosion depth of the specimens in 60 incidence (tilted incidence) is significantly deeper than that of the <b>normal</b> incidence. The <b>erosion</b> behaviour of specimens has little dependence on the kinetic energy of ion (E-k = 360, 700 keV). On the other hand, surface roughness of the irradiated area is obviously decreased due to erosion compared with the un-irradiated area. A fiat terrace is formed...|$|R
40|$|This {{conventional}} {{literature review}} discusses whether pathological tooth wear is age dependant. It briefly reviews {{the components of}} tooth wear and the prevalence of tooth wear in children, adolescents and adults. The emphasis on terminology relating to tooth wear varies. In some countries, the role of erosion is considered the most important, whereas others consider the process to {{be a combination of}} erosion, attrition and abrasion often with one being more dominant. The importance of tooth wear or erosion indices in the assessment and the evidence for progression within subject and within lesions is described. The data from the few studies reporting pathological levels of wear reported in children and adults are discussed, in particular its relationship with age. There is little evidence to support the concept that pathological levels of erosion or wear are age dependant. There is, however, some evidence to suggest that <b>normal</b> levels of <b>erosion</b> or wear are age dependant...|$|R
40|$|Spinal {{tuberculosis}} {{most commonly}} presents as a paradiscal lesion involving the disc space and adjacent vertebral bodies. Atypical forms of spinal tuberculosis {{have been described}} and are most often a result of posterior element involvement. The authors report a patient, who presented with complete posterior migration of an intact vertebral body, a complication of spinal tuberculosis {{that has not been}} reported till date. A 12 -year-old girl with history of pulmonary tuberculosis presented with progressive paraparesis and back pain. Plain X-rays and MRI revealed that the L 2 vertebral body had migrated posteriorly into the spinal canal, without significant movement of the posterior elements. The vertebral body was <b>normal,</b> with no <b>erosion</b> or bone loss. However, bilateral pedicle and facet joint involvement was seen. The neural elements were decompressed through an anterolateral retroperitoneal approach and the spine reconstructed. The authors present this rare manifestation of spinal tuberculosis and discuss the possible mechanisms of this presentation...|$|R
40|$|Summary: In the 1950 s, {{increased}} erosion, {{flooding and}} sedimentation was widely observed in New Zealand. The ruling opinion then {{was that the}} forests prevented erosion and floods, and browsing mammals were primarily responsible for the increased erosion of mountain lands. It followed that effective control of browsing mammal populations was necessary to prevent erosion and alleviate lowland flooding and alluviation. In the 19608 evidence was found for much severe erosion on the Ruahines in the 1840 s-long before browsing mammals were there. Furthermore, four severe periods of erosion had affected the Ruahines, Ureweras and elsewhere, since the 13 th century and each had ended regardless of humans, and without their assistance. By 1985 I was {{able to show that}} there have been at least seven other periods of accelerated erosion since 180 AD, similar to, but greater than, the current one. These were long before even Polynesians and their animals had arrived in New Zealand. The present period of increased erosion and alluviation is primarily the consequence of atmospheric warming and the bigger rainstorms and floods it brings. Browsing mammals have not contributed significantly but they do reduce the density of the vegetation which minimises <b>normal</b> soil <b>erosion</b> and hence the concentrations of fine sediments in streams. The primary objectives in managing browsing mammals should be to: (a) protect the indigenous vegetation for itself and as habitats of native animals, and (b) enhance the beneficial effects of vegetation on the stability of surface soil and on water quality...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{study the}} role of {{interleukin}} 22 (IL- 22) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods IL- 22 serum levels were measured in patients with early, treatment-naive RA (n= 49) and in 45 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals as controls. Patients were assessed clinically and radiographically at baseline and followed up for 2 years. Correlations of IL- 22 serum levels were sought with parameters of disease activity, serological markers, demographic factors and the incidence of erosions. IL- 22 production by peripheral blood T cells was investigated by intracellular fl ow cytometry. Results 24 of 49 patients with RA demonstrated elevated IL- 22 levels compared with the range of healthy controls. At baseline, {{a high percentage of}} these patients (8 / 24, 33 %) demonstrated bone erosions, whereas only one patient (4 %) from the group with normal IL- 22 had erosions. During the 2 years of follow-up, six additional patients with increased IL- 22 at baseline developed erosions. In contrast, none of the patients in whom IL- 22 levels were <b>normal</b> developed <b>erosions</b> despite similar treatment regimens. Multivariate regression analysis accounting for other parameters predictive for erosions, such as the presence of rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies and disease activity, showed that elevated IL- 22 baseline levels were independently and signifi cantly associated with erosive RA. Cellular analysis demonstrated enhanced expression of IL- 22 from CD 4 T cells in RA. Conclusion IL- 22 is elevated in the serum of half of the patients with RA. Elevated serum IL- 22 allows discrimination between patients with different radiographic progression and indicates a possible involvement of IL- 22 in the pathophysiology of RA...|$|R
40|$|The Smithfield 7. 52 ̆ 7 {{quadrangle}} {{is located}} about 13. 8 kilometers (8. 6 miles) {{south of the}} Utah-Idaho State Line and occupies the central portion of {{the eastern side of}} Cache Valley, Utah. The mapped area contains more than 55 square miles. The Bear River Range on {{the eastern side of the}} quadrangle contains stratigraphic units ranging from Precambrian to Quaternary age. Cache Valley contains deposits of Tertiary and Quaternary age. Quaternary units in the Smithfield quadrangle are subdivided into thirty-two map units based on age and genesis. Five ages of Quaternary units are identified, and these units are assigned to one of fourteen genetic types. The East Cache fault zone is mapped along the western edge of the Bear River Range. Early Quaternary time was principally a period of pediment formation, followed by <b>normal</b> faulting, <b>erosion,</b> and alluvial-fan deposition. Cache Valley was later occupied by a pre-Bonneville cycle lake which is tentatively correlated with the Little Valley lake cycle. This lacustrine cycle was followed by more erosion and alluvial-fan deposition. The current Cache Valley landscape is dominated by the sediments and geomorphic features of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville. Alluvial-fan deposition has been the principal geologic process in post-Lake Bonneville time. Geologic hazards in the Smithfield quadrangle include flooding, landslides, debris flows, rock fall, problem soils, shallow ground water, earthquake ground shaking, surface fault rupture, and liquefaction. Some of the areas affected by these hazards and measures for mitigating the hazards are identified. Bonneville lake cycle fine-grained offshore deposits and the Tertiary Salt Lake Formation are the primary geologic units susceptible to landsliding...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the so called, (pilas, gnammas, vasque, etc.), small concavities that retain {{the water of}} the rain/ runoff that develops etching processes. Some authors support the beginning of the form already undersoil/ regolith, though all recognize the main development of the form in subaerial environment. The chemical weathering by water increases the size of the pias (pilas, gnamma, vasque), much greater when older is the surface over it develops. Any process that stop the <b>normal</b> evolution (burial, <b>erosion,</b> etc.) can modificate the relative age of the host surface that will be demonstrated younger than in reality is. The size parameters defined by statistic analysis of this measures has a relative chronological value since demonstrate the relationship among evolution of the form and the age of the surface. In this work is presented the analysis of evolution of pias (gnammas, pilas, vasque), of different surfaces developed with a chronology topografically successive to the one which can be assigned also an absolute chronology (by cosmogenic isotopes) that it has been used to know the generation age of the for...|$|R
40|$|Current volcanological {{knowledge}} of the Cilimani-Gurghiu-Harghita (CGH) volcanic chain, the southernmost seg-ment of the Carpathian Neogene/Quaternary volcanic arc, is reviewed. The CGH arc is naturally subdivided into four geographically distinct segments: Cdlimani, Gurghiu, North Harghita and South Harghita, and basically consists of a row of adjacent or partially overlapping compositdvolcanoes accompanied by their respective peripheral volcaniclastic aprons. Lava-flow activity and dome extrusions were the main edifice-building events, punctuated by episodic explosive events, some of which produced non-welded pumice and ash flow deposits. Lava dome eruptions, accompanied by gravitational or explosive collapses of the growing domes over steep slopes, generated block-and-ash flows. Edifice failure and related debris avalanche events were common features in several composite volcanoes. Redistribution of loose slope material to topographic lows by debris flows, hyperconcentrated flood flows and <b>normal</b> stream <b>erosion</b> contributed to the accumulation of peripheral volcaniclastic aprons, mostly on land, but also locally in lacustrine environments. Volcanic edifices are typical medium-sized andesitic composite volcanoes, some of them attaining the caldera stage, complicated by summital or peripheral domes or dome complexes. Dacitic volcanoes are smaller in size and consist of lava dome complexes, in places with associated pyroclastic cones and volcaniclastic aprons. The volcanic history of CGH lasted ca. 9. 5 Ma, with the oldest activity (9. 5 Ma) occurring in the northern parts and the youngest at the southern chain-termnus. The last eruption of Ciomadul volcano is only ca 10000 yr old. Along-arc migration of volcanism is obvious especially in the southernmost segment. A new structural model for the CGH, based on volcanic facies distribution (, or , and or facies) is proposed. It fits the field observations, K-Ar dating and modern structural models of composite volcanoes worldwide better than the previous model. 1...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{proliferation}} {{involves an}} active reprogramming of cellular bioenergetic pathways towards glucose metabolism {{in order to}} meet the metabolic demands of anabolic growth. NF-κB family of transcription factors coordinate many of the signals that drive proliferation during immunity, inflammation and oncogenesis, but whether NF-κB plays a role in regulating the metabolic reprogramming necessary for cell division during these processes is unknown. In this study, we found that NF-κB functions as a central regulator of energy homeostasis by managing the balance between the utilization of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. NF-κB inhibition causes cellular reprogramming to aerobic glycolysis under basal conditions and induces necrosis on glucose deprivation. The metabolic rearrangement that results from NF-κB inhibition bypasses the requirement for tumour suppressor mutation in oncogenic transformation and hinders metabolic adaptation in cancer in vivo. We also identified a mechanism through which NF-κB regulates metabolism and demonstrated the physiological significance of the role of NF-κB in metabolic adaptation in normal and cancerous cells. We also investigated additional functions of NF-κB in oncogenesis mediated via the regulation of telomerase, a tumourigenic factor and downstream target of NF-κB. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that elongates the telomeres of chromosomes to compensate for <b>normal</b> telomeric <b>erosion</b> which occurs at all chromosomes. In recent years, a growing body of evidence has suggested telomere-independent roles of telomerase. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether telomerase also modulated cancer cell metabolism. Our results demonstrate a previously unanticipated role for the catalytic subunit of telomerase, TERT, in regulating the Myc-dependent signalling program which provides one explanation for the role of sustained telomerase activity in human cancer. Given that in cancer, Myc is often a passive conduit for upstream oncogenic flux including that of aberrant NF-κB activity, and global inhibition of both Myc and NF-κB could lead to undersirable toxicities, our data might lead to the development of novel combinatorial cancer treatment modalities.

40|$|The exact {{relation}} between gastro-oesophageal reflux and asthma remains poorly understood. To determine whether gastro-oesophageal reflux in asthmatics results in oesophagitis, endoscopy and oesophageal biopsy {{were performed on}} 186 consecutive adult asthmatics. The {{presence or absence of}} reflux symptoms was not used as a selection criterion for asthmatics. Endoscopy was performed by two endoscopists using predefined criteria. All asthmatics had discrete wheezing and either a previous diagnosis of asthma or documented reversible airways obstruction of at least 20 %. The oesophageal mucosa was graded as <b>normal</b> if no <b>erosions</b> or ulcerations were present in the tubular oesophagus; as oesophagitis if a mucosal break with exudate (erosions and/or ulcerations) was present; and as Barrett's if specialised (intestinal) columnar epithelium was present. A hiatal hernia was diagnosed if {{greater than or equal to}} 2 cm of gastric mucosa appeared above the diaphragm during endoscopy. Thirty nine per cent of the patients with asthma had oesophagitis or Barrett's oesophagus, or both. There was no difference in the oesophageal mucosal status between asthmatics who required and those who did not require bronchodilators. Fifty eight per cent of asthmatics had a hiatal hernia. It is concluded that oesophagitis is common and independent of the use of bronchodilator therapy in asthmatics...|$|R
