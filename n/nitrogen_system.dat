40|$|A {{thermal cycling}} {{absorption}} process (TCAP) for hydrogen isotope separation {{has been in}} operation at Savannah River Site since 1994.

40|$|Spectrographic {{work done}} at the Atmospheric Reentry Material and Structures Facility (arc jet) located at the Johnson Space Center {{has led to the}} {{identification}} of several excited molecular and atomic states. The excited molecular states identified are: first positive <b>nitrogen</b> <b>system,</b> second positive <b>nitrogen</b> <b>system,</b> the first negative <b>nitrogen</b> <b>system,</b> the gamma system for nitric oxide, and the 306. 4 nm system of OH. Excited atoms identified were nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, silicon, copper, sodium, barium, potassium, and calcium. The latter five are considered contaminants. Excited molecular states of oxygen were not seen, suggesting full dissociation of oxygen molecules to oxygen atoms within the arc column and nozzle. Further, evidence exists that O(-) may be present since a background continuum is seen, and because of the existence of positive species (first negative system of N 2 (+)). Interpretation of spectrographic plates was enhanced by the use of a microdensitometer, and by the application of a second order least squares routine which determined wavelength as a function of plate location.

40|$|The Superconducting Super Collider {{consists}} of two parallel magnet rings, each 87, 120 m in circumference, constructed in a tunnel 25 m to 74 m below ground level. They are operated at a controlled low helium temperature {{in order to maintain}} the magnet windings in the superconducting state. To obtain this condition, the magnet cryostat is designed with a high-quality insulation obtained by a high vacuum chamber, multilayer insulation, and thermal shields at nominal temperatures of 84 K and 20 K. Thermal radiation and the conduction heat load through the supports are intercepted and absorbed by the 84 -K shield. Liquid nitrogen provides the refrigeration for these loads. The 84 -K shield is anchored to two 63. 5 -mm stainless-steel tubes. One of the tubes, the ``liquid line,`` serves as a conduit in the distribution system of liquid nitrogen. The other tube, the ``vapor line,`` is used to collect the nitrogen vapor generated in the cooling process and to supply this vapor to,the helium refrigerators for precooling. The vapor line may also be used as a continuous cooler by injecting controlled amounts of liquid nitrogen. The <b>nitrogen</b> <b>system</b> {{consists of}} nitrogen supplies; ten nitrogen dewars for the collider and two for the High Energy Booster located on the ground at the main shaft entrances; liquid and vapor transfer lines through the shaft to connect the surface and the tunnel systems; and transfer lines to bypass warm equipment sections of the collider.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{and reliability of}} cryocooler are continually improving. Consequently, the cryocooler based systems are also coming into the market and more frequently used by technical persons, scientists in their laboratory experiments or for commercial and space applications. The fundamental advantage of cryocooler is {{the small size of}} its cold head due to this it take little space and can be mounted on top of a Dewar, thus it helps in minimizing overall size of the cryocooler based setup. With this type of setup, it possible to fulfil the requirement of liquid helium and liquid nitrogen in laboratories where the consumption of liquid helium and liquid nitrogen is not in higher quantities. Dewar is used to store liquid cryogen, for production and storage purposes. We have developed a small-scale helium liquefaction <b>systems</b> and a <b>nitrogen</b> liquefaction <b>system</b> separately that provide solutions for liquid helium usage in laboratories. The helium liquefaction systems use two-stage GM cryocooler with 1. 5 W cooling power at 4. 2 K (Sumitomo modelSRDK- 415 D with compressor CSW- 71 D, consuming 6. 5 kW electrical power) to provide cooling and condensation at 4. 2 K and the <b>nitrogen</b> liquefaction <b>system</b> use a Cryomech Single stage Gifford-Mcmahon cryocooler to provide cooling and condensation of nitrogen at 80 K with the refrigeration capacity of 266 W (Rated) at 80 K. The cold head/liquefier resides inside of the neck of a dewar in both helium and <b>nitrogen</b> liquefaction <b>system.</b> The room temperature helium gas to be liquefied enters the neck of the dewar and is efficiently pre-cooled by cold head before being liquefied. The two-stage GM cryocooler with 1. 5 W cooling power at 4. 2 K (Sumitomo model SRDK- 415 D with compressor CSW- 71 D, consuming 6. 5 kW electrical power), equipped with heat exchanger at 2 nd stage for condensing the incoming precooled gas by exposing larger surface area. No additional cooling power of cryoliquids or additional Joule–Thomson stages was utilized in case of helium and <b>nitrogen</b> liquefaction <b>system.</b> Measurements of the pressure dependence of the liquefaction rate were performed in both case of liquefaction system. The assembly of two-stage Gifford -McMahon cryocooler with heat exchangers and helium liquefaction container is usually accomplished in helium liquefaction system and the assembly of single stage GM cryocooler with heat exchangers and nitrogen liquefaction container is usually accomplished in <b>nitrogen</b> liquefaction <b>system.</b> The pressure gauge has to be connected to the container in both type of liquefaction system to examine the oscillation that gives the liquefaction rate. Also diodes are placed on the container to measure the temperature of helium and nitrogen at different stages in container.
