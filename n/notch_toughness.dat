The experimental samples were mechanically alloyed in a Szegvari attritor, extruded at 343 and 427 C, and some were solution-treated at 520 and 566 C and naturally, as well as artificially, aged at 170, 190, and 210 C for times of up to 1000 hours. All alloys exhibited maximum hardness after being aged at 170 C; lower hardness corresponds to the solution treatment at 566 C than to that at 520 C. A comparison with ingot metallurgy alloys of the same composition shows the MA material to be stronger and more ductile.

40|$|When the {{structural}} integrity of notched components is analysed, {{it is generally}} assumed that notches behave as cracks, something which generally provides overconservative results. The proposal of this paper consists, on the one hand, {{in the application of}} the theory of critical distances for the estimation of the <b>notch</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> and, therefore, for the conversion of the notched situation into an equivalent cracked situation in which the material develops a higher fracture resistance. On the other hand, once the <b>notch</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> has been defined, the assessment is performed using the failure assessment diagram methodology, and assuming that the notch effect on the limit load is negligible. The methodology has been applied to 336 CT notched fracture specimens made of two different structural steels, covering temperatures from the corresponding lower shelf up to the upper shelf, providing satisfactory results and a noticeable reduction in the overconservatism derived from the analyses in which the notch effect is not considered...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{fracture}} toughness (resistance) of glasses {{is a fundamental}} problem of prime theoretical and practical importance. Here we theoretically study its dependence on the loading rate, the age (history) of the glass and the notch radius ρ. Reduced-dimensionality analysis suggests that the <b>notch</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> results from a competition between the initial, age- and history-dependent, plastic relaxation timescale τ^pl_ 0 and an effective loading timescale τ^ext(K̇_I,ρ), where K̇_I is the tensile stress-intensity-factor rate. The toughness is predicted to scale with √(ρ) independently of ξ≡τ^ext/τ^pl_ 0 for ξ≪ 1, to scale as T√(ρ) (ξ) for ξ≫ 1 (related to thermal activation, where T is the temperature) and to feature a non-monotonic behavior in the crossover region ξ∼ O(1) (related to plastic yielding dynamics). These predictions are verified using novel 2 D computations, providing a unified picture of the <b>notch</b> fracture <b>toughness</b> of glasses. The theory {{highlights the importance of}} timescales competition and far from steady-state elasto-viscoplastic dynamics for understanding the toughness, and shows that the latter varies quite significantly with the glass age (history) and applied loading rate.

The alloy variants contain varying amounts of W, Ta, Ge and/or Ce as elements substituting the radiologically unfavorable alloying elements of Mo, Ni, Nb and Al. In three production series, thirteen different batches have been produced and analyzed so far. Up to now, the variant of 9. 5 Cr- 1 W+Mn, V, Ta has proved to be the most promising one.

40|$|Bulk {{metallic}} glasses (BMGs) {{have the potential}} to exhibit exceptional wear-resistance due to their high hardness and strength. Combined with their other unique properties, this makes them ideal candidates {{for a wide range of}} technological applications (e. g. gears, bearings, biomaterials). In the course of this dissertation, high-glass-forming bulk {{metallic glasses}} are prepared and characterized in order to identify wear-resistant compositions and optimize their toughness. First, a comprehensive study identifies a class of Cu-Zr-based BMGs that exhibit more exceptional wear performance than other BMGs. The results demonstrate that when BMGs are designed properly, they exhibit wear properties that compete with, and can surpass, state-of-the-art engineering materials. It is identified that, in order to optimize the wear performance of Cu-Zr-based BMG gears, toughness should be maximized. Second, the <b>notch</b> <b>toughness</b> of wear-resistant Cu 43 Zr 43 Al 7 Be 7 BMGs with in-situ crystallization is investigated. In order to identify in-situ crystallization using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation, extremely long dwell times and high X-ray fluxes are required. This demonstrates the importance of reporting operating parameters when trying to evaluate the amorphous nature of BMGs. XRD, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) are used to identify the metastable crystalline phase. The <b>notch</b> <b>toughness</b> is found to correlate closely with the amount of crystallization and the composition of the remaining amorphous matrix. Finally, the effect of substituting standard-grade zirconium lump (99. 8 % excluding up to 4 % hafnium) for high-purity zirconium crystal bar (99. 5 %) in Cu 43 Zr 43 Al 7 Be 7 is investigated. Introducing low-purity zirconium significantly decreases the glass-forming-ability and reduces the <b>notch</b> <b>toughness</b> of the BMG. Furthermore, Weibull statistics provide an analysis of the variability in toughness for high-purity ingots synthesized both in a small laboratory arc-melter and synthesized commercially.
