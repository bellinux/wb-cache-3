[...] "The mission has been in charge of <b>native</b> <b>missionaries</b> and I'm terribly nervous that they've let things slide. They're good men, I'm not saying a word against them, God-fearing, devout, and truly Christian men--their Christianity would put many {{so-called}} Christians at home to the blush--but they're pitifully lacking in energy. They can make a stand once, they can make a stand twice, but they can't make a stand all the time. If you leave a mission in charge of a <b>native</b> <b>missionary,</b> no matter how trustworthy he seems, in course of time you'll find he's let abuses creep in." ...|$|R

50|$|With the {{partition}} of Bengal in 1905, the Swadeshi movement had been inaugurated. One {{way in which the}} Indian Christians responded to it was by developing indigenous leadership and freedom from foreign domination and dependence within the church. With this idea, the National <b>Missionary</b> <b>Council</b> was founded. It was founded on the principle that it will use only indigenous personnel, methods and money for its work. The Society was never active in politics but because it was purely Indian in its personal and management, it continued to express sympathy to the national movement. The National <b>Missionary</b> <b>Council</b> (NMC) was established in 1912 at Calcutta. NMC comprised British and Indian missionaries. Paul was one of the prominent leaders of this council for many years.|$|R

The project aim was that of realizing educational films to be played by mobile cinemas {{for the education of}} the black ("bantu") people. About 35 such films, on 16mm, were produced between 1935 and 1937, when the project's Carnegie grant expired. The project was led by J.

50|$|The {{received}} history holds that, in 1934, Karl Hartenstein, a German missiologist, {{coined the}} phrase {{in response to}} Karl Barth. This language, it is argued, was {{picked up at the}} 1952 Willingen conference of the International <b>Missionary</b> <b>Council</b> (IMC) and developed theologically by Lutheran theologian, Georg Vicedom.|$|R
50|$|The modern ecumenical {{movement}} {{began to}} take shape {{at the end of the}} 19th century. Initiatives among students and between church mission agencies led the way.

2500|$|The African Inland Mission began campaigning against FGM in 1914, and in 1916 the Church of Scotland Mission said {{it would}} excommunicate African Christians who practised it. The Kenya <b>Missionary</b> <b>Council</b> was the first {{organization}} known to call it mutilation; Marion Scott Stevenson, a Church of Scotland missionary, coined the term [...] "sexual mutilation of women" [...] for the practice in 1929, and the <b>Missionary</b> <b>Council</b> followed suit. That year African teachers working in CSM and AIM schools were asked to sign an oath renouncing both FGM and membership of the Kikuyu Central Association, the representative body of the Kikuyu people. Ninety percent of the African congregations chose to leave rather than swear the oath. Ronald Hyam writes that the issue split the Kikuyu Christian community into kirore (abolitionists) and karinga (traditionalists).|$|R
