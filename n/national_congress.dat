5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> is the party's highest organ. The {{direction}} of the Party and the Government is decided at the <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> held every fifth year.

5|$|Planning for the 6th <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> {{began at}} the 19-day-long 10th plenum of the 5th Central Committee (19 May – 9 June 1986). Lê Duẩn, the General Secretary, gave the opening speech, where he reaffirmed the central party leadership's {{commitment}} to reform. The 10th plenum unanimously approved the draft Political Report for the 6th <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> Preparations for the Congress began with party congresses at the grass-root and provincial-levels, during which delegates were elected.|$|E
5|$|The 1st plenum of the 6th Central Committee {{brought an}} end to the {{protracted}} generational succession which had begun at the 4th <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1976. On 17 December, the Congress' third day, the three top leadersTrường Chinh, Lê Đức Thọand head of government Phạm Văn Đồng, announced that they would not seek membership of the 6th Politburo or the 6th Central Committee. However, these three were appointed to the Advisory Council to the Central Committee. This was not new; at the 5th <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> six senior members of the 5th Politburo retired. When asked by foreign journalists if the same pattern would continue, a party spokesman stated that it would continue at the 6th <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> Văn Tiến Dũng, the Minister of National Defense, retired from the politburo but retained his seat in the 6th Central Committee. The 1st plenum elected Nguyễn Văn Linh to succeed Trường Chinh as party General Secretary.|$|E
5|$|The CPC is, officially, {{organized}} on {{the basis}} of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> convened every fifth year. When the <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> is not in session, the Central Committee is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year, most duties and responsibilities are vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. The party's leader holds the offices of General Secretary (responsible for civilian party duties), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and State President (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts the party leader is the country's paramount leader. The current paramount leader is Xi Jinping who was elected at the 19th <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> held in October 2017.|$|E

5|$|The local congresses {{preceding}} the 6th <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> {{were far more}} organized than those held before the 5th <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> Unlike the previous Congress, the central party leadership issued instructions and training programs for party cadres on how to organize party congresses and conferences. Certain party cadres were made responsible for tutoring the executive committee directly subordinate {{to them on the}} Central Committee's draft Political Report. Local executive committees started convening conferences in early August to study the draft report. These conferences acted as precursors to the village-, municipal-, ward- and enterprise-level Party committee congresses, which started convening in mid-August. By early August, some grassroots-level party organs had begun the election of delegates to the 6th <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> At least five provinces had completed preparations for the basic-level party congresses by September, in four of these the basic-level congresses ran until late September.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the 5th <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> the party {{leadership}} had turned into a veritable gerontocracy. The five most powerful Politburo members were all over the age of 70; Lê Duẩn was 74, Trường Chinh was 75, Phạm Văn Đồng was 76, Phạm Hùng was 70 and Lê Đức Thọ was 72. Lê Duẩn {{is believed to have been}} in bad health during this period; he had travelled to the Soviet Union on several occasions for medical treatment during the late-1970s and early 1980s. It was reported that Lê Duẩn did not lead the party delegates of the 5th <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> to the Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum because of his deteriorating health. Lê Duẩn looked both feeble and old; he had problems reading his report to the Congress.|$|E

5|$|The 1888 {{session of}} the Indian <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> {{was held in the}} city, and {{by the turn of the}} 20th century Allahabad was a revolutionary centre.

The Nehru family homes, Anand Bhavan and Swaraj Bhavan, were centres of Indian <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> activity. During the years before independence Allahabad was home to thousands of satyagrahis led by Purushottam Das Tandon, Bishambhar Nath Pande, Narayan Dutt Tiwari and others.

5|$|The early women’s {{movement}} in China focused on eradicating {{the assumption that}} women were inferior to men. The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves to be inferior to men. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting the rights of women. During the 2nd <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{a control}} system was {{inspired}} by Vladimir Lenin in The State and Revolution. Lenin argued that every communist vanguard party, at all levels, needed a system to supervise party-official elections, dismissals and performance. His writings led {{to the establishment of}} the Soviet Central Control Commission; the control system and the Communist Party of China (CPC) structure were imported to China. The importance of discipline and supervision was emphasised since the CPC's founding. The 2nd <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> amended the party constitution, devoting a chapter to party discipline. However, no institution was established to safeguard party norms or supervise cadre behaviour. Until the establishment of the Central Control Commission (CCC) at the 5th <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1927, local party committees were responsible for supervising members and control commissions were established at the central and provincial level.|$|E
5|$|The main {{players in}} the {{politics}} of the state are the All India Trinamool Congress, the Indian <b>National</b> <b>Congress,</b> and the Left Front alliance (led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M)). Following the West Bengal State Assembly Election in 2011, the All India Trinamool Congress and Indian <b>National</b> <b>Congress</b> coalition under Mamata Banerjee of the All India Trinamool Congress was elected to power (getting 225 seats in the legislature). Prior to this, West Bengal was ruled by the Left Front for 34 years (1977–2011), making it the world's longest-running democratically elected communist government. Banerjee was re-elected as Chief Minister in the 2016 election in which Trinamool Congress won an absolute majority.|$|E
5|$|The main {{political}} parties are the Left Front and the All India Trinamool Congress with the Bharatiya Janata Party having limited support base along with regional parties like IPFT, INPT and the Indian <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> Until 1977, {{the state was}} governed by the Indian <b>National</b> <b>Congress.</b> The Left Front was in power from 1978 to 1988, and then again from 1993 onwards. During 1988–1993, the Congress and Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti were in a ruling coalition. In the last elections held in February 2013, the Left Front won 50 out of 60 seats in the Assembly, 49 of which went to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM). As of 2013, Tripura {{is one of the}} two states in India where the communist party is in power. The other state is Kerala.

5|$|In practice, {{the delegates}} rarely discuss issues at length at the <b>National</b> <b>Congresses.</b> Most {{substantive}} discussion takes {{place before the}} congress, in the preparation period, {{among a group of}} top party leaders.
