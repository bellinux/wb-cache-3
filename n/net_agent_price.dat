Holonic manufacturing systems are new paradigms to handle uncertainties {{and changes in}} manufacturing environments. Among many sources of uncertainties, failure prone machines {{are one of the}} most important ones. This paper focuses on handling machine failures in holonic manufacturing systems. Machine failure will reduce the number of available resources. Feasibility analysis need to be conducted to check whether the works in process can be completed. To facilitate feasibility analysis, we characterize feasible conditions for systems with failure prone machines. This paper combines the flexibility and robustness of multi-agent theory with the modeling and analytical power of Petri net to adaptively synthesize Petri <b>net</b> <b>agents</b> to control holonic manufacturing systems. The main results include: (1) a collaborative Petri <b>net</b> (CPN) <b>agent</b> model for holonic manufacturing systems, (2) a feasible condition to test whether a certain type of machine failures are allowed based on collaborative Petri <b>net</b> <b>agents</b> and (3) fault tolerant analysis of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} agent {{migration}} {{is the major}} difference between logical code mobility of software agents and physical mobility of mobile nodes in ad hoc networks. Without considering agent transfer, it would make little sense to mention the modeling of strong code mobility, which aims to make a migrated agent restarted exactly from the state when it was stopped before migration. From the perspective of system' s architecture, this paper proposes a two-layer approach for the formal modeling of logical agent mobility (LAM) using predicate/ transition (PrT) nets. We view a mobile agent system {{as a set of}} agent spaces, and agents could migrate from one space to another. Each agent space is explicitly abstracted to be a component, consisting of an environmental part and an internal connector dynamically binding agents with their environment. We use a system <b>net,</b> <b>agent</b> <b>nets</b> and a connector net to model the environment, agents and the connector respectively. In particular, <b>agent</b> <b>nets</b> are packed up as parts of tokens in system <b>nets,</b> so that <b>agent</b> transfer and location change are naturally captured by transition firing (token game) in Petri <b>nets.</b> <b>Agent</b> <b>nets</b> themselves are active only at specific places and disabled at all the other places in a system net. The semantics of such a two-layer LAM model is defined by transforming it into a PrT net. This facilitates the analysis of several properties about location, state, and connection. In addition, this paper also presents a case study of modeling and analyzing an information retrieval system with mobile agents...|$|R

40|$|By {{employing}} dynamic pricing, the act {{of changing}} prices over time within a marketplace, sellers {{have the potential to}} increase their revenue by selling goods to buyers "at the right time, at the right <b>price.</b> " Software <b>agents</b> have been used in electronic commerce systems to assist buyers, but there is limited use of selling agents in today's markets. As dynamic pricing systems become necessary as a competitive maneuver and as market mechanisms become large scale and more complex, there is a growing need for <b>pricing</b> <b>agents</b> to be used to automate dynamic pricing, which challenges sellers to improve their understanding of what are the best <b>agent</b> <b>pricing</b> strategies for their marketplaces. This thesis addresses these issues by presenting the Learning Curve Simulator, a market simulator designed for analyzing <b>agent</b> <b>pricing</b> strategies for a market in which a seller has a finite time horizon to sell its inventory. Through an analysis of several pricing strategies using the simulator, I demonstrate how the Learning Curve Simulator {{can be used as a}} tool for understanding the relevant factors in determining an effective dynamic pricing strategy.

40|$|First version: October 2001) Habit {{formation}} {{has been}} proposed as a possible solution for explaining the equity premium puzzle. This paper extends the class of models that support the habits explanation in order to account for heterogeneity in earnings, wealth, habits and consumption. I find that habit formation increases the equity premium. However, contrary to the earlier results in the literature, the habit hypothesis does not imply a price for risk {{much higher than the}} one implied by models with intertemporally separable preferences. The main reasons for this are general equilibrium ones. First, with just two assets available, households can smooth out consumption fluctuations very well. Therefore, the higher utility losses of uncertainty imposed by habits will not command a high price of risk because households manage to avoid this risk. Second, the composition of the set of <b>agents</b> <b>pricing</b> the assets is sensitive to changes in the model. In an economy with habits, <b>pricing</b> <b>agents</b> turn out to be households facing very small consumption fluctuations.

Introducing such intrafirm conflicts results in higher prices and lower effort levels.

The hierarchical structure of hypernets is not static in contrast to other models of mobility based on Petri <b>nets.</b> <b>Agents</b> can exchange tokens with their sub- or superagents, and thereby change the hierarchy. Hypernets, in the simple form presented here, are descriptions of finite dynamic systems. This note explains how each hypernet {{can be seen as}} a compact representation of a standard Petri net.
