40|$|OBJECTIVES: We used {{data from}} {{national}} surveys {{to measure the}} rate of HIV testing in the general US population and among persons at increased behavioral risk and summarized what has been learned about HIV testing from these surveys. METHODS: Three nationally representative surveys were used: the National Health Interview Survey for 1987 through 1995, the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth, and the 1996 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. These surveys asked about HIV testing experience and behavioral risks for HIV. Rates of testing were computed for all persons, including those {{at increased risk for}} HIV. RESULTS: From 1987 to 1995, the percentage of adults ever tested increased from 16 % to 40 %. The 3 surveys were consistent with one another, and all showed much higher rates of testing for persons at increased risk for HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Surveys have provided information on HIV testing that is <b>not</b> available <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>including</b> rates of testing from private sources and public programs. Efforts to measure HIV testing and its correlates should continue and should be improved to provide information essential for effective programs...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{algebraic}} geometry provides {{a number of}} efficient tools for approximating the solutions of polynomial systems. One such tool is the parameter homotopy, which can be an extremely efficient method to solve numerous polynomial systems that differ only in coefficients, not monomials. This technique is frequently used for solving a parameterized family of polynomial systems at multiple parameter values. Parameter homotopies have recently been useful in several areas of application and have been implemented {{in at least two}} software packages. This article describes Paramotopy, a new, parallel, optimized implementation of this technique, making use of the Bertini software package. The novel features of this implementation, <b>not</b> available <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>include</b> allowing for the simultaneous solutions of arbitrary polynomial systems in a parameterized family on an automatically generated (or manually provided) mesh in the parameter space of coefficients, front ends and back ends that are easily specialized to particular classes of problems, and adaptive techniques for solving polynomial systems near singular points in the parameter space. This last feature automates and simplifies a task that is important but often misunderstood by non-experts. 1...|$|R
40|$|Data {{integrity}} constraints usually form a {{major component}} in a data-intensive business system. To successfully reengineer a data-intensive business system, its data integrity constraints must be understood. Functional dependencies constitute an important type of data integrity constraints. Due {{to the nature of}} system development, a significant amount of functional dependencies is usually omitted during the initial system development stage and only discovered during the system maintenance stage. Usually, these dependencies are enforced in the programs which update the databases, and are <b>not</b> shown <b>elsewhere</b> <b>including</b> the databases. Existing approaches for the discovery of functional dependencies from databases cannot find such functional dependencies. We develop a theory for inferring functional dependencies in a database from the programs which update the database. With the use of the theory, a comprehensive approach for the recovery of functional dependencies from both database schemas and programs is consequently proposed. The proposed approach can recover those functional dependencies which cannot be found by the existing approaches. The functional dependencies recovered from the proposed approach are proven. 1...|$|R
40|$|We examine {{effects of}} urban {{passenger}} rail upgrades to Auckland's Western Line, including double tracking, station development, and related urban renewal projects. The results {{are used to}} assess anticipated net benefits of the developments. The rail-related upgrades {{are expected to be}} completed in late 2010, but have been well publicised and so should already be factored into people's location and pricing decisions. Our analysis compares developments near Western Line stations with developments elsewhere in Auckland, thus controlling for wider regional and macroeconomic impacts. As well as describing developments, we estimate the impact on property values of station proximity. Changes in property values are used to identify benefits due to the upgrades since prospective property buyers bid up the price of a property to include the net benefits; otherwise they would be outbid by another prospective buyer. "Net benefits" include gross benefits less direct additional property-tax costs due to the project but do <b>not</b> <b>include</b> costs borne <b>elsewhere</b> (though these can be accounted for separately). We utilise actual property sale prices using a repeat sales methodology to measure price appreciation. Specifically, we examine whether price appreciation is affected by proximity to Western Line stations, allowing for different effects at each station. Our main focus is on residential values but we refer also to commercial and industrial applications...|$|R

40|$|We {{outline the}} scope of this special issue of New Zealand Journal of Ecology, which reviews {{progress}} in New Zealand ecology to 2009, based on a symposium in 2007. Both the issue and symposium update a 1986 conference and 1989 special issue of NZ J Ecol called “Moas, Mammals and Climate” which has been influential and widely cited. This issue revisits several themes featured in 1989, including the extent of recent and prehistoric extinctions in the New Zealand fauna; effects of introduced mammalian herbivores replacing now-extinct browsing birds such as moa; the impacts of introduced mammalian predators on native birds (hence the Feathers to Fur title); the role of islands as refuges and opportunities for restoration; and the status of bird-plant mutualisms like pollination and fruit dispersal. Several topics not discussed in 1989 are raised, including the unusual size and functional composition of New Zealand’s tree flora, and several taxonomic groups (invertebrates, fungi) and habitats (fresh waters) that received little attention in 1989. We summarise four symposium talks which are <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in this issue. New Zealand leads the world in ways both unenviable (e. g. levels of impact of introduced species) and enviable (e. g. predator eradication, translocations, rare species management). The recent advances reviewed in this issues have relevance well beyond New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{growth in}} the tourism industry over the last decades and the increasing travel by people with health conditions prompted {{the establishment of the}} discipline of travel medicine which, however, remained a strictly medical domain. It is argued that the interdependence between tourism and health is much more far-reaching and requires a broader approach. It has long been known that the cooperation between representatives from health and from the tourism industry is very limited. A strategy was required that would enable the two disciplines to work together in reaching a common goal. As part of such a strategy, a subject has been written for undergraduate and postgraduate students in the disciplines of health or tourism. The multi-disciplinary approach advocated for in this subject is applied to practice by having students from both fields studying the same content. This subject gives an overview of the disciplines of health and tourism. After reinforcing the links and interdependence between both, the emphasis is placed on health issues important to the traveller and - <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>elsewhere</b> - the hosts. Finally, issues of cooperation between both disciplines are discussed highlighting the inclusion of health issues in the concept of sustainable tourism and the need for an increase in education on tourism and health On completion of this subject students will be able to • demonstrate an understanding of the concepts of tourism and health and their interdependence; • give an overview of the health hazards connected with modern travel; • demonstrate an understanding of the impacts of tourism and travel on the health of the host communities; • develop strategies to apply their knowledge of pertinent issues into practice under particular consideration of the need for collaboration between the health and tourism industries. The subject is available as a distance learning package and, therefore, also suitable for international students wishing to complement their courses with an elective subject pertinent to their field of study. It is envisaged that the subject will be translated into Spanish. ...|$|E
