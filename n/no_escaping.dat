25|$|In 1997–98, the relegation was avoided on {{the final}} day as goals from Martin Foyle, Jan Jansson and Lee Mills secured a 4–0 win over Huddersfield Town, at the expense of Manchester City and Stoke City. The next season was another struggle, and John Rudge was {{controversially}} sacked in January 1999. He was replaced by former player Brian Horton, who spent big to secure the club's a second consecutive final-day escape. There was <b>no</b> <b>escaping</b> the drop in 1999–2000 however, as they were some thirteen points short of safety. Horton led the club to LDV Vans Trophy success in 2001, beating Brentford in the final at the Millennium Stadium, Marc Bridge-Wilkinson and Steve Brooker getting the goals. Following this the Valiants lost the services of veterans Tony Naylor and Allen Tankard, and a disappointing 14th-place finish followed in 2001–02. At the end of 2002, Bill Bell called in the administrators, with the club around £1.5 million in debt. Valiant 2001 secured control of the club after a long and drawn-out process as the season neared its close.|$|E

DiCaprio remembers, [...] "it was many months in this house and there was <b>no</b> <b>escaping</b> the environment. I think it fed into the performances." [...] They could not film in a period accurate house because it would have been too small to shoot inside. Production Designer Kristi Zea is responsible for the [...] "iconic, nostalgic images of quaint Americana", although she says that was [...] "absolutely the antithesis of what we wanted to do".

2500|$|The Hawthornes {{had three}} children. Their first was {{daughter}} Una, born March 3, 1844; {{her name was}} a reference to The Faerie Queene, to the displeasure of family members. Hawthorne wrote to a friend, [...] "I find it a very sober and serious kind of happiness that springs from {{the birth of a}} child... There is <b>no</b> <b>escaping</b> it any longer. I have business on earth now, and must look about me for the means of doing it." [...] In October 1845, the Hawthornes moved to Salem. In 1846, their son Julian was born. Hawthorne wrote to his sister Louisa on June 22, 1846: [...] "A small troglodyte made his appearance here at ten minutes to six o'clock this morning, who claimed to be your nephew." [...] Daughter Rose was born in May 1851, and Hawthorne called her his [...] "autumnal flower".|$|E
2500|$|Emerson's work {{not only}} {{influenced}} his contemporaries, such as Walt Whitman and Henry David Thoreau, but {{would continue to}} influence thinkers and writers in the United States {{and around the world}} down to the present. Notable thinkers who recognize Emerson's influence include Nietzsche and William James, Emerson's godson. There is little disagreement that Emerson was the most influential writer of 19th-century America, though these days he is largely the concern of scholars. Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau and William James were all positive Emersonians, while Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry James were Emersonians in denial—while they set themselves in opposition to the sage, there was <b>no</b> <b>escaping</b> his influence. To T. S. Eliot, Emerson's essays were an [...] "encumbrance." [...] Waldo the Sage was eclipsed from 1914 until 1965, when he returned to shine, after surviving in the work of major American poets like Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane.|$|E

2500|$|Duke Latin American studies {{professor}} Ariel Dorfman hypothesizes that Che's been [...] "comfortably transmogrified into {{a symbol}} of rebellion" [...] precisely because those in power no longer believe him to be dangerous. Dorfman suspects the attempt to subvert Che could backfire, positing that 3billion people now live on less than $2 a day and thus [...] "the powerful of the earth should take heed: deep inside that T shirt where {{we have tried to}} trap him, the eyes of Che Guevara are still burning with impatience." [...] Expressing a similar sentiment, director Jonathan Green acknowledges that [...] "Che is turning over in his grave" [...] because of the commercialization; in Green's view, Che's visage also {{has the potential to be}} a [...] "Trojan horse" [...] of capitalist marketing, by embedding itself into pop iconography. In his example, corporations in their desperate drive to sell goods, create the opportunity for observers to see the [...] "logo" [...] and ask [...] "who was that guy?" [...] Trisha Ziff, curator of Che! Revolution and Commerce believes that regardless of the [...] "postmodern" [...] diffusion, you can't disassociate Che from [...] "radical ideas and change", nor can one control it. In Ziff's view, despite the endless array of merchandising, the symbol of Che will continue to be worn and have resonance. Critical pedagogical theorist Peter McLaren theorizes that American capitalism is responsible for the Che phenomenon, stating that [...] "the United States has a seductive way of incorporating anything that it can't defeat and transforming that 'thing' into a weaker version of itself, much like the process of diluting the strength and efficacy of a virus through the creation of a vaccine." [...] Neo-Marxist and critical theorist Herbert Marcuse argued that in the contemporary capitalist world there is <b>no</b> <b>escaping</b> such co-optation, theorizing that we are made [...] "one-dimensional" [...] by capitalism's single-minded orientation toward greed and growth. Author Susan Sontag spoke of the potential positive ramifications of utilizing Che as a symbol, positing: ...|$|E
