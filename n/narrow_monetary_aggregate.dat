40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{relevance}} of <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> for <b>monetary</b> policy as indicators of real activity. The main hypothesis of this paper is that <b>narrow</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> can help forecasting real output. The empirical analysis combines the time scale decomposition of time series using wavelets and the possible existence of cointegrating relationships between money, output and prices. Using recent Peruvian data, evidence is found to support the proposed hypothesis. In particular, the results suggest the existence of co-integration between non-stationary series built using wavelet filtering. In this context, exogeneity tests reveal that <b>narrow</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> are weakly and strongly exogenous; i. e., they are helpful for forecasting real output. These results suggest that money has a role for monetary policy as an indicador of real activity. ...|$|R
40|$|Although many {{countries}} have abandoned monetary targeting in recent decades, <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> are still useful indicators of future economic activity.

Based on an analysis over a sample period from 1975 Q 1 to 2005 Q 1, the authors determine that the leading-indicator properties of the <b>narrow</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> for output growth have shifted over time and that, since 1993, real M 1 + has become a better indicator of future output growth than real gross and net M 1. ...|$|R

Furthermore, changes in the rate of interest provide information that helps predict future movements of M 1 -velocity. Finally, the results derived from Engle and Granger (1987) two-step procedure suggest that M 1 -velocity is subject to control through policy-induced interest rate and exchange rate movements, thus justifying the adoption of M 1 as a useful monetary target. ...|$|E

40|$|Data {{for five}} major industrialized economies {{show that the}} {{relationship}} between credit and nonfinancial economic activity exhibits stability comparable to that of the relationship between money and economic activity. Specific orderings among a <b>narrow</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregate,</b> a broad monetary aggregate and a credit aggregate differ depending upon the stability criterion being applied and the country under study. On balance, credit exhibits the most stable contemporaneous relationship among the three aggregates, while the narrow money stock exhibits the most stable dynamic relationship with credit in second place and the broad money stock third. Further tests for the same five economies also show that, within the total of nonfinancial debt comprising the aggregate, the respective publicand private debt components exhibit movements over time that offset one another, and hence act to maintain the stability of total credit in relation to economic activity. Finally, additional tests for these five economies do not support the notion that the comparability of the respective relationships of credit and money to nonfinancial economic activity is due to any straightforward process whereby "money causes income and income causes credit. " The interrelationships among money, credit, real income and prices in each economy are too complex to admit of any such simple interpretation. ...|$|E

We show that instability cannot be excluded when a standard money demand function is estimated, irrespectively of the use of M 1 or M 2. Then, we argue that the reason for possible instability resides in the omission of relevant variables, as we show that a fully stable demand for narrow money (M 1) can be obtained from an augmented money demand function involving real exchange rate and its volatility as additional explanatory variables.

40|$|Narrow Money-Transactions Money The {{growth rate}} of the <b>narrow</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> picked up in 1999, {{reflecting}} the expansion in economic activity and the stabilization of interest rates. The sharp acceleration of the narrow aggregates in recent months suggests buoyant growth in GDP in coming quarters. Signs of a possible rise in inflation are also emerging.

In 1999, the {{growth rate of}} M 1 also began to converge with that of the other narrow aggregates, M 1 + and M 1 ++. This suggests that the influence of the special factors that have been affecting the growth rate of M 1 has diminished. Broad Money-"Store of Value" Household savings represent deferred consumption, and therefore the broad <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregate</b> provides information about future spending and, hence, inflation.

40|$|Currency board {{arrangements}} (CBAs) are a {{very strong}} form of fixed exchange rate regime. Like the gold standard, they rely on market forces, rather than on foreign exchange controls or interventions, to fix the exchange rate. CBAs have been adopted {{in a variety of}} institutional forms and with varying degrees of success in a number of economies. In theory, the classical CBA, which originated in the 19 th century, uses three anchors to fix the exchange rate: (i) economic discipline, because of the requirement that currency issues should be fully backed by foreign reserves; (ii) specie flow and interest arbitrage; and (iii) currency (cash) arbitrage, which binds the spot exchange rate. In practice, not all three anchors function effectively in every CBA. Regarding economic optimality, the case for or against CBAs is broadly similar to the debate on fixed versus floating exchange rate, but the link between the <b>narrower</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregate</b> and the balance of payments in a CBA tends to be even closer than in other fixed rate regimes. Williamson (1995) has identified some advantages and disadvantages of CBAs. Insofar as a great deal of resources have been committed to CBAs to make them more credible and robust, they may have difficulty adjusting to major structural changes and irreversible divergence in the longer run. Modifying or abandoning them would carry very high adjustment cost or exit cost.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{behaviour}} of the income velocity of money in major OECD economies has displayed considerable volatility for both <b>narrow</b> and broad <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> (Table 1).

Such movements in velocity may arise as a consequence of changes in money demand in two important ways: they may result from movements along the money demand function, as the normal implication of changes in its interest rate and inflation expectations arguments; and the money demand function itself may shift (money demand instability), leading to unpredictable changes in velocity.

40|$|Recent asset pricing {{models of}} limits to {{arbitrage}} emphasize {{the role of}} funding conditions faced by financial intermediaries. In the US, the repo market is the key funding market. Then, the premium of on-the-run U. S. Treasury bonds should share a common component with risk premia in other markets. This observation leads to the following identification strategy. We measure the value of funding liquidity from the cross-section of on-the-run premia by adding a liquidity factor to an arbitrage-free term structure model. As predicted, we find that funding liquidity explains the cross-section of risk premia. An increase {{in the value of}} liquidity predicts lower risk premia for on-the-run and off-the-run bonds but higher risk premia on LIBOR loans, swap contracts and corporate bonds.
