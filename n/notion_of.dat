In this book she explores {{the ways that}} primary family relations affect subjectivity in my continued attempt to articulate a theory of subjectivity and intersubjectivity that can ground the ethical relation. Here, Oliver argues that there are contradictions {{at the heart of}} Western conceptions of maternity and paternity and the rhetoric surrounding those concepts that make our <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> relationships with ourselves and with others problematic. Using examples from philosophical texts, psychoanalytic theory, studies in biology and medicine, examples from legal cases, and popular culture, Oliver challenges <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> maternity that are associated with nature and <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> paternity that are associated with culture. By addressing familial relations as formative relationships in the development of our conceptions of ourselves as individuals in relationships, she develops novel <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> subjectivity and intersubjectivity that refigure our <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> ourselves and our <b>notions</b> <b>of</b> our relations to others. By articulating alternative ways to conceive of ourselves as subjects, Oliver develops an alternative intersubjective approach to ethics or questions of values, family values.|$|R
