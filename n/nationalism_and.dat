5|$|Approximately 27,000 Boer {{women and}} {{children}} died in British concentration camps, resulting in a long-lasting legacy of bitterness towards the British and claims of genocide of Afrikaners.

5|$|In {{subsequent}} decades, republicanism would regain {{lost ground}} {{with the rise of}} liberalism, <b>nationalism,</b> <b>and</b> later socialism. The Revolutions of 1848 were largely inspired by republicanism.

5|$|By 1942 Pane {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} playwrights in Java, together with El Hakim (pseud. Aboe Hanifah) and Usmar Ismail. Their works often dealt with politics, a sense of <b>nationalism,</b> <b>and</b> the influence of one's environment—particularly tradition, ethics, and religion. As with Kami, Perempuan, these works were oriented around everyday events and featured average people, as opposed to the earlier stories based in mythology and telling of gods and goddesses.|$|E
5|$|He {{soon became}} {{known for his}} {{nationalist}} views. He co-founded the Kilusang Makabansa (National Progress Movement), an organization which frequently spoke out on issues of <b>nationalism</b> <b>and</b> social justice in the 1950s. In 1953, he joined the Magsaysay-for-President Movement, a volunteer group supporting the presidential campaign of Ramon Magsaysay, heading its Executive Planning Committee and working as a speechwriter for candidates of the Nacionalista Party.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the nature of}} ethnic Germans' self-identities <b>and</b> <b>nationalisms</b> in interwar Slovenia. Slovenia's German minorities' reactions to domestic social policies and world events that impacted them are examined primarily through locally-based German-language newspapers. Germans in Slovenia had had multiple identities <b>and</b> <b>nationalisms,</b> <b>and</b> these were shaped by social policies and domestic and foreign events, especially after the National Socialists' seizure of power in Germany in 1933. Pan-German <b>nationalism</b> was strong <b>and</b> widespread, and viewed Slovene minority policies as being purposeful attempts to eradicate {{the very existence of}} Germandom. This type of nationalism competed with other types of German <b>nationalisms</b> <b>and</b> identities which sought to integrate into and contribute to Slovene society without compromising their uniquely Germanic culture. National Socialism's appeal was so strong because it promised a reunion of Slovenia's Germandom with the wider Volk and a restoration of the minorities' societal dominance in the region...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the <b>nationalism(s)</b> <b>and</b> {{multiculturalism}} in the Macedonian society, and the multicultural democracy contingency within Macedonian practice.

5|$|In 1953, in {{the face}} of African opposition, Britain {{consolidated}} the two Rhodesias with Nyasaland (Malawi) in the ill-fated Central African Federation, which was essentially dominated by Southern Rhodesia. Growing African <b>nationalism</b> <b>and</b> general dissent, particularly in Nyasaland, persuaded Britain to dissolve the Union in 1963, forming three separate divisions. While multiracial democracy was finally introduced to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, however, Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy minority rule.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 Mikoyan helped Khrushchev {{organize}} the Secret Speech, which Khrushchev {{delivered to the}} 20th Party Congress, that denounced Stalin's personality cult. It was he, and not Khrushchev, who made the first anti-Stalinist speech at the 20th Congress. Along with Khrushchev, he helped roll {{back some of the}} stifling restrictions on <b>nationalism</b> <b>and</b> culture imposed during Stalin's time. In 1954, he visited his native Armenia and gave a speech in Yerevan, where he encouraged Armenians to republish the works of Raffi and the purged writer Yeghishe Charents.|$|E
5|$|The Autobiography of Malcolm X was {{published}} in 1965, {{the result of a}} collaboration between human rights activist MalcolmX and journalist Alex Haley. Haley coauthored the autobiography based on a series of in-depth interviews he conducted between 1963 and MalcolmX's 1965 assassination. The Autobiography is a spiritual conversion narrative that outlines MalcolmX's philosophy of black pride, black <b>nationalism,</b> <b>and</b> pan-Africanism. After the leader was killed, Haley wrote the book's epilogue. He described their collaborative process and the events at the end of MalcolmX's life.|$|E

5|$|Turkish <b>nationalism</b> <b>and</b> secularism {{were two}} of the six {{founding}} principles of the Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the leader of {{the early decades of the}} Republic, aimed to create a nation state (Turkish: Ulus) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. During the first three decades of the Republic, efforts to Turkify geographical names were a recurring theme. Imported maps containing references to historical regions such as Armenia, Kurdistan, or Lazistan (the official name of the province of Rize until 1921) were prohibited (as was the case with Der Grosse Weltatlas, a map published in Leipzig).|$|E
5|$|While {{staying in}} Cornish in 1908, Hand began a close {{friendship}} with the political commentator and philosopher Herbert Croly. At the time, Croly was writing his influential book The Promise of American Life, in which he advocated a program of democratic and egalitarian reform under a national government with increased powers. When the book was published in November 1909, Hand sent copies to friends and acquaintances, including former president Theodore Roosevelt. Croly's ideas had a powerful effect on Roosevelt's politics, influencing his advocacy of New <b>Nationalism</b> <b>and</b> the development of Progressivism.|$|E
5|$|White South African {{critics of}} apartheid, such as liberal {{politician}} Alex Boraine and Afrikaner anti-apartheid activist Beyers Naudé, were labelled unpatriotic Boerehaters by Nationalists and the Afrikaans press {{in an attempt}} to discredit them.

South African poet and writer Guy Butler was called a Boerehater by Afrikaners for his promotion of English-language literature and his opposition to Afrikaner <b>nationalism</b> <b>and</b> the National Party.|$|E
