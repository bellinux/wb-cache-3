Other purin- 8 -ols were prepared {{and the production}} of analogs similar to the previously mentioned adduct was attempted. 6 -Chloropurin- 8 -ol and 6, 9 -diaminopurin- 8 -ol hydrochloride monohydrate reacted with phosphorus oxychloride and N, <b>N-diethylaniline</b> to yield water-soluble intermediates which could not be isolated. 6 -Aminopurin- 8 -ol chlorinated in the 8 -position {{in the presence of the}} reaction mixture rather than producing the phosphorus oxychloride adduct. In the course of the work described herein, two previously unreported compounds, 4 -amino- 6 -hydrazino- 5 -nitropyrimidine and 6, 9 -diaminopurin- 8 -ol hydrochloride monohydrate, were synthesized.

40|$|Single-drop microextraction (SDME) {{coupled with}} gas chromatogra-phy-flame {{ionization}} detector (GC-FID) {{was developed for}} the extrac-tion and determination of aromatic amines (AAs) in environmental water samples. A silicon tube was introduced for the SDME proce-dure by inserting it into the needle of the micro-injector. In this man-ner, a large volume of extractant is allowed to be suspended for the extraction, leading to the enhancement of method sensitivity and re-producibility. Extraction parameters which control the performance of SDME such as the type of microextraction solvent and volume, sample pH, ionic strength and extraction time were investigated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the SDME–GC meth-od exhibited good linearity from 0. 5 to 50 mg mL 21 for aniline and 4 -methylaniline and 0. 1 to 50 mg mL 21 for N-methylaniline and N, <b>N-diethylaniline.</b> The enrichment factors were calculated to be 42 – 509. The SDME–GC method was performed for the determination of AAs in environmental water samples including drinking, lake and sea water, and excellent recoveries and relative standard deviations (RSD values) ranging from 79. 5 to 122. 7 % and 3. 2 to 13. 3 %, respec-tively, were obtained. The results demonstrated that SDME–GC is a rapid, simple and effective sample preparation method and could be successfully applied for the determination of AAs in environmental water samples...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} thermal {{behaviour}} of polyfluoroaryl prop- 2 -ynyl ethers and thioethers in the vapour phase and solution phase. It also reports the thermolyses of 2 -fluoromethyl- 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoronaphtho (2, 1 -b) furan (l 6 l) {{in the presence}} of 2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -ene and 3, 3 -dimethylbut-l-ene respectively. Chapter 1 discusses the history, mechanism and stereochemistry of the Glaisen and thio-Claisen rearrangements of aromatic prop- 2 -enyl and prop- 2 -ynyl systems. While Chapter 2, reports on the various cyclisation reactions that may follow an initial Glaisen rearrangement. Chapter 3 deals with the literature on the Glaisen and thio-Claisen rearrangements of polyfluoroaryl systems which are directly related to those under study in this thesis. Chapters 4 and 5 describe the isomerisation reactions of pentafluorophenyl prop- 2 -ynyl thioether (167) and 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 -heptafluoro- 2 -naphthyl prop- 2 -ynyl thioether (171). Chapter 4 is concerned with the reaction of compound (167) with p-xylene and benzene at 180 C and {{in the presence of}} BF (_ 3) -etherate, at 25 C. Chapter 5 reports upon the reactions of the thioether (171) with benzene and p-xylene at l 40 C and 160 C. At l 60 G, in nickel apparatus the isomerisation product 2 -fluoromethyl- 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoronaphtho (2, 1 -b) thiophen (173) is shown to be an intermediate in the conversion of the thioether (171) to the substitution product, 2 -(2, 5 -dimethylbenzyl) - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoronaphtho (2, 1 -b) thiophen (173) with p-xylene. This chapter also highlights the differing courses of reactions of the thioether (17 l) in glass and nickel apparatus. Chapter 6 reports the isomerisation reactions of 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 -heptafluoro- 2 -naphthyl prop- 2 -ynyl-ynyl ether (156) in both the liquid phase and vapour phase. The glass surface of the reaction vessel was shown to act as a Lewis-acid catalyst at elevated temperatures, in the reaction of the naphthyl ether (156) with p-xylene and isopropylbenzene to give the aromatic substitution products (159) and (160) respectively. Whereas in nickel apparatus, the 2 -fluoromethyl compound (161) was the main product in both reactions. Chapter 7 discusses the mechanism of the isomerisation reactions of the polyfluoroaryl prop- 2 -ynyl ethers and thioethers studied in this thesis. It also incorporates a critical experiment in which compound (161) is reacted with N, <b>N-diethylaniline</b> at 140 C only to be recovered unchanged. (The thermolysis of (161) in p-xylene at the, same temperature gives the substitution product (159) exclusively) The charge-separated species (197) and (195) are proposed as intermediates in the reactions of the ether (156) and thioether (171) via the heterolytic fission of the sp (^ 3) C-F bond in the Claisen rearrangement intermediates (157) and (172) respectively. It is concluded that the isomerisation reactions of (I 56) and (171), which require a 1, 4 -fluorine shift, proceed via an ionic mechanism. The final chapter describes the thermolysis reactions of the naphthyl ether (156) and the 2 -fluoromethyl compound (161) with 2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -ene and 3, 3 -dimethylbut-l-ene. Compounds (156) and (161) react with 2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -ene at 150 C to give 2 -(2, 2, 3 -trimethylbut- 3 -enyl) - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoronaphtho (2, 1 -b) furan (186) and a small amount of 2 -(2, 3, 3 -trlmethylbut-l. enyl) - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoro-naphtho(2, 1 -b) furan (187) compound (161) reacts with 3, 3 -dimethylbut-l-ene at 25 C in the presence of BF(_ 3) -etherate to give the Markovnikov addition-elimination product, 2 -(3, 4 -dimethylpent- 3 -enyl) - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoro-naphtho (2, 1 -b) furan (194) and a small amount of (186). Thermolysis of both (156) and (161) with 3, 3 -dimethylbut- 1 ene gave (186) as the major product accompanied by smaller amounts of (187) and (194). It is proposed that compounds (186) and (187) arise via reaction with 2, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -ene formed by isomerisation of the terminal alkene. 2 -Chloromethyl - 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -hexafluoronaphtho (2,l-b) furan (161 a) has been prepared; it reacts with 3, 3 -dimethylbut-l-ene in the presence of ZnCl (_ 2), to give (186), (194) and (196) ...|$|E
