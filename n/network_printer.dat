50|$|The first mass-market Ethernet <b>network</b> <b>printer,</b> the HP LaserJet IIISi, {{debuted in}} March 1991. Priced at $5,495, it {{featured}} a high-speed, 17 ppm engine, 5MB of memory, 300-dpi output, Image REt and such paper handling features as job stacking and optional duplex printing. The LaserJet IIISi also was HP’s first printer to offer onboard Adobe PostScript emulation {{as opposed to}} the font-cartridge solution offered on earlier models.|$|E
50|$|Risograph is a {{brand of}} digital duplicators {{manufactured}} by the Riso Kagaku Corporation, that are designed mainly for high-volume photocopying and printing. It was released in Japan in August 1986. It is sometimes called a digital duplicator or printer-duplicator, as newer models {{can be used as}} a <b>network</b> <b>printer</b> as well as a stand-alone duplicator. When printing or copying many duplicates (generally more than 20) of the same content, it is typically far less expensive per page than a conventional photocopier, laser printer, or inkjet printer.|$|E
50|$|A {{computer}} network facilitates interpersonal communications allowing users to communicate efficiently and easily via various means: email, instant messaging, online chat, telephone, video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may {{access and use}} resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared <b>network</b> <b>printer</b> or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, {{and other types of}} information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. Distributed computing uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.|$|E

50|$|Designed as a {{networking}} operating system, Windows NT 3.1 supports multiple network protocols. Besides IPX/SPX and NetBEUI, the TCP/IP protocol {{is supported}} allowing {{access to the}} Internet. Similar to Windows for Workgroups, files and printers can be shared and the access rights and configuration of these resources can be edited over the network. When a <b>network</b> <b>printer</b> is installed, the required drivers are automatically transferred over the network, removing the need to manually install the drivers for every computer. The Remote Access Service (RAS) allows a client from outside the network to connect to the network using a modem, ISDN or X.25 and access its resources. While the workstation allows one RAS connection at a time, the server supports 64.|$|E
50|$|HP Jetdirect {{was first}} {{introduced}} in March 1991 (code named QuickSilver) with the LaserJet IIIsi <b>network</b> <b>printer</b> (code named Eli). Jetdirect is based on HP's MIO (Modular Input/Output) interface, which was designed {{from the ground up}} with the IIIsi to create a mainstream full function high performance networked printer. The initial MIO interface card had Ethernet and Token Ring physical layer variants and used various networking protocols over an AUI/BNC connection. Initially, a printer needed a separate card for each protocol, such as TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, or DLC/LLC. The following year the team applied the technology to the legacy accessory slot on the LaserJetIIs and IIIs XIO (Extended Input/Output). MIO type Jetdirect cards were also used for network connectivity on some HP/Agilent laboratory equipment such as the 6890A and 6890 Plus series of gas chromatographs. These included unusual network connection types such as HPs I-Net which was used as an interconnect between various pieces of hardware that controlled the 58xx and 68xx series gas chromatographs. Not until 1994 would MIO interface cards be released that could support more than one protocol per card.|$|E
50|$|There are {{basically}} {{two categories of}} card printer software: desktop-based, and web-based (online). The biggest {{difference between the two}} is whether or not a customer has a printer on their network that is capable of printing identification cards. If a business already owns an ID card printer, then a desktop-based badge maker is probably suitable for their needs. Typically, large organizations who have high employee turnover will have their own printer. A desktop-based badge maker is also required if a company needs their IDs make instantly. An example of this is the private construction site that has restricted access. However, if a company does not already have a local (or <b>network)</b> <b>printer</b> that has the features they need, then the web-based option is a perhaps a more affordable solution. The web-based solution is good for small businesses that don't anticipate a lot of rapid growth, or organizations who either can't afford a card printer, or don't have the resources to learn how to set up and use one. Generally speaking, desktop-based solutions involve software, a database (or spreadsheet) and can be installed on a single computer or network.|$|E

50|$|Service Location Protocol (SLP) is {{supported}} by Hewlett-Packard's <b>network</b> <b>printers,</b> Novell, and Sun Microsystems. SLP is described in RFC 2608 and RFC 3224 and implementations are available for both Solaris and Linux.|$|R

50|$|NetBIOS on Windows and its sibling SMB {{on other}} {{operating}} systems, supports individual hosts {{on the network}} to advertise services, such as file shares and printers. It also supports for example a <b>network</b> <b>printer</b> to advertise itself as a host sharing a printer device and any related services it supports. Depending on how a device is attached (to the network directly, or to the host which shares it) and which protocols are supported however, Windows clients connecting to it may prefer to use SSDP or WSD over using NetBIOS. NetBIOS {{is one of the}} providers on Windows implementing the more general discovery process dubbed 'Function Discovery' which includes built-in providers for PnP, Registry, NetBIOS, SSDP and WSD of which the former two are local-only and the latter three support discovery of networked devices. None of these need any configuration for use on the local subnet. NetBIOS has traditionally been supported only in expensive printers for use in companies and the cheapest devices of some brands today still don't have support for it, but home and SOHO users would connect printers to a computer over say a parallel port or USB and share it from the computer. However, today even entry-level printers with Wi-Fi or Ethernet support of some brands support it natively, allowing the printer to be used without configuration even on very old operating systems (combined with a generic PostScript driver, for example).|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Service {{advertisement}} {{and discovery}} {{is an important}} component for ad hoc communications and collaboration in ubiquitous computing environments. However, the nature of ad hoc networks pose additional problems – caused by highly dynamic network topology and nodes ’ limited power sources-compared to wireless networks with infrastructure, even if the infrastructure is just services that stay continuously available most of the time, like a <b>network</b> <b>printer.</b> Service discovery protocols have been designed specifically for ad hoc networks, e. g. JESA, DEAPspace, and Konark, but they also fail to solve all the problems. Index Terms—ad hoc networks, service discovery, ubiquitous computing I...|$|E
40|$|Hewlett Packard {{recently}} released a new security patch to fix an authentication bypass vulnerability in specific network printers. The Enterprise Security Office is using {{this opportunity to}} remind agencies {{of the importance of}} securing network printers in general. Network printers are frequently overlooked when securing office networks; sometimes left with default configurations and not patched, they represent a risk to the office network environment. Network based printers are much more than just a print device. They typically have full operating systems, hard drives, and a full complement of communication services. Built-in services such as ftp, tftp, e-mail, web server, and snmp are increasingly the target of choice for hackers wanting to remain undetected and to gain a foothold in the office network. Because <b>network</b> <b>printer</b> devices are frequently left unsecured with default passwords and utilizing factory default settings they are easy targets. Example attacks against printers include bridging between networks (i. e wireless to LAN or vice-versa), sniffing network traffic to steal sensitive data, redirection and spoofing of network traffic, malware distribution and email spam generation.

25|$|The laser printer, {{based on}} a {{modified}} xerographic copier, was invented at Xerox in 1969 by researcher Gary Starkweather, who had a fully functional <b>networked</b> <b>printer</b> system working by 1971. Laser printing eventually became a multibillion-dollar business for Xerox.|$|R
40|$|In some {{distributed}} systems, {{resources are}} leased, usually for a fixed period of time. For instance, a client leases a <b>network</b> <b>printer</b> for ten minutes. We consider {{the first step}} of leasing – acquisition, and extend the concept of the acquisition of a single resource to that of a collection of resources. In such a context, clients must have simultaneous access to all of the requested resources for the lease to be useful. This paper describes designs and implementations for collective acquisition of resources in distributed systems. It begins with the application background of our research, followed by the formalization of the problem. We then introduce our algorithm and prove its correctness. Two implementations are specified and compared. Evaluation of the performance of the algorithms is based on the measurements of the network overhead caused by the exchange of control messages, and the measurements of the average response time for the requests. Implemented in Java, our system makes novel use of multi-cast to enhance performance and uses heart-beat heuristics to achieve fault-resilience. Finally, we propose approaches to optimize the system performance exploiting soft global state information...|$|E
40|$|Standby- and {{idle mode}} {{operations}} of {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (EEE) consume around 22 billion kWh of energy {{every year in}} Germany [1] causing at least 4 billion Euros of economical losses [2] and burdening the climate with greenhouse gas emissions. IT-Designers, Fraunhofer IZM and other partners therefore develop a new system that completely disconnects and reconnects network-EEE to the power grid on demand. In principle, the printing job sent from a computer to a <b>network</b> <b>printer</b> would connect the printer to the power grid and completely disconnect it after the printing job is done. Rules can be defined for each device to achieve a tradeoff between availability, performance and energy consumption. The switching technology is based on a network switch with Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) functionality and SBØ-logic. Each EEE in the network must have an additional specific switch. This switch can be installed externally for network EEE that is already on the market. For EEE in development, a miniaturized version of such a switch will be developed which can be integrated by EEE manufacturers into their products. The SBØ-system itself does not consume energy if it is not in switching operation. The SBØ-system can be used to control all network-EEE with an Ethernet connection. In more advanced technical development stages, the SBØ-system can be expanded to control other EEE without ethernetconnections integrating available or planned standby-blocker-systems on the market...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} COMPAQ QuickSource, {{an electronic}} problem-solving and information system for Compaq’s line of networked printers. A major goal in designing this system was to empower Compaq’s customers with expert system technology {{to allow them}} to solve advanced <b>network</b> <b>printer</b> problems entirely on their own. This process minimizes customer down-time, reduces the number of phone calls to the Compaq Customer Support Center (resulting in monetary savings), improved customer satisfaction, and, perhaps most importantly, differentiates Compaq printers in the marketplace by providing the best, and most technologically advanced, customer support facility. This approach also represents a re-engineering of Compaq’s customer support strategy and implementation. In its first generation system, SMART, the objective was to provide expert knowledge to Compaq’s help desk operation to better and more quickly answer customer calls and problems. QuickSource is a second generation system in that the customer support function is put directly {{in the hands of the}} consumers (an example of “knowledge publishing”). As a result, the design of QuickSource presented a number of different and challenging issues. Because the product would be used by a diverse and heterogeneous set of users, a significant amount of human factors research and analysis was performed to help design and implement the system. The analysis also dictated certain decisions on the organization and design of the expert system component. Since September 1992, Compaq has shipped more than 3, 000 copies of QuickSource...|$|E
