40|$|A turbine {{designed}} to power a supersonic compressor was investigated with four nozzle settings and one <b>nozzle</b> modification <b>to</b> determine {{the effect on}} turbine performance. With the correct ratio of <b>nozzle</b> throat area <b>to</b> <b>rotor</b> effective throat area, the design specific work was obtained near the peak efficiency. From {{the results of the}} investigation it was concluded that the convex in sweep of the rotor inner wall and high degree of blade taper caused the turbine configuration to have two aerodynamic disadvantages in comparison with a turbine configuration with an axial inner wall at the rotor outlet and little axial taper...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} neutron {{scattering}} investigation on methyl group dynamics in glassy toluene confined in mesoporous silicates of different pore sizes. The experimental {{results have been}} analysed {{in terms of a}} barrier distribution model, such a distribution following from the structural disorder in the glassy state. Confinement results in a strong decreasing of the average rotational barrier in comparison to the bulk state. We have roughly separated the distribution for the confined state in a bulk-like and a surface-like contribution, corresponding <b>to</b> <b>rotors</b> at a <b>distance</b> from the pore wall respectively larger and smaller than the spatial range of the interactions which contribute to the rotational potential for the methyl groups. We have estimated a distance of 7 Amstrong as a lower limit of the interaction range, beyond the typical nearest-neighbour distance between centers-of-mass (4. 7 Amstrong).

40|$|During {{designing}} a new axial flux permanent magnet free rod rotor synchronous motor, {{it is important}} to know before hand in which phase the largest angular velocity can occur, what is the ways to reduce the power consumption, how to achieve to increase or decrease the rotation speed by changing the core geometry. Therefore, presenting these preliminary information that are necessary for the design of a free rod <b>rotor</b> synchronous motor <b>to</b> the researchers is the aim of this work. In this respect, this study presents the design and geometrical dimensions of the stator for a new synchronous motor which is an axial flux permanent magnet free rod machine with three, four, five and six phases. This type of motors are an innovative approach especially for the applications used in industrial stirrers. Each type of stator is designed such that it has an appropriate number of phases. The rotating magnetic field over the stator is established by a PIC based microcontroller feeding the interface circuit to the stator wounds. The maximum angular speeds of bar magnet rotors with four different lengths and masses are calculated theoretically and determined experimentally. In addition, the effects of the <b>distance</b> between the <b>rotor</b> and stator, the angular speed of the rotor within the limits of the operation, and the volume of the liquid to be stirred to the power applied are investigated. Furthermore, the effects of the lengths and angular speeds of the bar magnet <b>rotors</b> <b>to</b> the <b>distance</b> between the <b>rotor</b> and stator are determined. In the light of the information obtained and taking into account the power used, the most appropriate parameters and variables such as the stator geometry changing with the phase used, the length of <b>rotor,</b> the <b>distance</b> between the <b>rotor</b> and stator and the angular speeds of rotor are determined. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
