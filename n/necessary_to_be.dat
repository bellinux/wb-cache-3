5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} usually {{straightforward}} to identify. The white-rumped swift {{is similar to}} Pacific swift, but its slender body and long, deeply forked tail make it appear quite different from its more powerfully built relative. A possible pitfall is a partially leucistic common swift with a white rump. The Pacific swift can be distinguished with care by its deeper tail fork, longer wings, bigger head, larger white throat patch and patterned underparts. In parts of Southeast Asia, migrating Pacific swifts pass through the resident ranges of former subspecies, and good views are then <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sure of correct identification.|$|E

25|$|The hora dance {{originates}} in the Balkans but {{also found in}} other countries (including Romania and Moldova). The dancers hold each other's hands and the circle spins, usually counterclockwise, as each participant follows a sequence of three steps forward and one step back.

In Bulgaria, it is not <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a circle; a curving line of people is also acceptable.|$|E
25|$|But {{cooperation}} {{within the}} Committee of Public Prosperity, since April 1793 {{the de facto}} executive government, started to break down. On 29 June 1794, three colleagues of Robespierre at 'the Committee' called him a dictator in his face – Robespierre baffled left the meeting. This encouraged other Convention members to also defy Robespierre. On 26 July, a long and vague speech of Robespierre wasn't met with thunderous applause as usual but with hostility; some deputies yelled that Robespierre should {{have the courage to}} say which deputies he deemed <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed next, what Robespierre refused to do.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle criticises the Spartans in his Politics: the helots keep rebelling; the Spartan {{women are}} luxurious; the magistrates (and {{especially}} the ephors) are irresponsible; reaching decisions by the loudest yell in the apella is silly; {{the wealth of}} the citizens is unequal (so that too many are losing the resources <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a citizen and a hoplite); and the Spartiates let each other evade taxes, so the city is poor and the individual citizens are greedy. Above all, the Spartans know no other arts than war, so in peace they are incompetent and corrupt. The Cretan institutions, he says, are even worse.|$|E
