Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in 1955 under Dave Halliday. The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having {{finished second in the}} league the previous season. Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>older</b> than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as Joe Harper. The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup Final, but losing both matches and finishing fourth in the league.|$|E

According to Hilda Ellis Davidson, Valhalla [...] "is well known because it plays so large a part in images of warfare and death," [...] yet the significance of other halls in Norse mythology such as Ýdalir, where the god Ullr dwells, and Freyja's Fólkvangr have been lost.|$|E
500|$|The cave's {{creation}} {{took place}} {{long after the}} marble formed. As groundwater seeped into cracks in the marble, it eventually dissolved enough rock to expand some of the cracks {{to the size of}} tunnels. Generally, the age of a cave cannot be determined directly because the cave itself is an empty space, but scientists can sometimes determine the age of speleothems or sediments in a cave. An early 21st-century study of speleothem development in Oregon Caves focused on the past 380,000 years. Based on the available evidence, the cave is thought to be at least a million years old and [...] "probably <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>older</b> than a few million" [...] years.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} sixteen, he was {{appointed}} by Sir Frederick Ouseley to the post of organist at the newly founded St. Michael's College, Tenbury. At that time Ouseley was Heather Professor of Music at Oxford University and had recently become vicar of St Michael's College {{on the outskirts of}} Tenbury Wells, a choir school with a church that he had founded and endowed and which was intended to {{serve as a model for}} Anglican church music. Although <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>older</b> than they were, Stainer was in charge of the choir and choristers, and one of his duties was to give piano lessons to the boys for two hours a day. Ouseley was an antiquarian and had an extensive library. He was much interested in the history of music and acted as Stainer's mentor. Under his guidance, Stainer became the youngest ever successful candidate for the Bachelor of Music degree at Oxford. For this, Stainer wrote a cantata, [...] "Praise the Lord, O my soul", with text from Psalm 103. Its traditional style was designed to appeal to the examining board and sounds stilted when set against his later works. About this time he wrote several anthems, the most successful of which was [...] "I saw the Lord", a bolder and more original work in a more contemporary style.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{the authorship}} of the Mahābhārata is {{attributed}} to Vyāsa. There have been many attempts to unravel its historical growth and compositional layers. The oldest preserved parts of the text {{are thought to be}} <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>older</b> than around 400BCE, though the origins of the epic probably fall between the 8th and 9th centuries BCE. The text probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period (c. 4th century CE). The title may be translated as [...] "the great tale of the Bhārata dynasty". According to the Mahābhārata itself, the tale is extended from a shorter version of 24,000 verses called simply Bhārata.|$|E

50|$|After {{the retreat}} {{of many of}} these glaciers, a stand of Ancient Lake Yosemite developed. The valley floor owes its {{flatness}} to sediment deposited by these stands (the last glaciers in the valley were small and did <b>not</b> remove <b>much</b> <b>old</b> lake sediment). The last stand of Lake Yosemite was about 5.5 miles (8.9 km) long and was impounded by a terminal moraine near the base of El Capitan. It was later filled by sediment, becoming a swampy meadow.|$|R

50|$|The rocks {{exposed by}} coastal erosion in North Anglesey belong mainly to what geologists call the Mona Complex, which {{is among the}} oldest rock units seen in Wales. It underlies, and is {{therefore}} older than, the slates of the North Wales quarrying industry, but is probably <b>not</b> very <b>much</b> <b>older</b> in geological terms. Since the remains of fossilized remains {{have been found in}} the rocks, it does not pre-date the origins of life and is therefore probably about 600 million years old.|$|R

60|$|The lady is very attractive, with {{a musical}} voice and soft {{appealing}} manners. She is young: that is, one feels {{sure that she}} is under thirty-five and over twenty-four. The gentleman does <b>not</b> look <b>much</b> <b>older.</b> He is rather handsome, and has ventured as far {{in the direction of}} poetic dandyism in the arrangement of his hair as any man who is not a professional artist can afford to in England. He is obviously very much in love with the lady, and is, in fact, yielding to an irresistible impulse to throw his arms around her.|$|R

50|$|Medius (Μήδιος; 4th-3rd century BC) a Greek {{physician}} {{who was a}} pupil of Chrysippus of Cnidos, and who lived therefore probably in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Galen says he was held in good repute among the Greeks, and quotes him apparently as a respectable authority on an anatomical question. Like the other pupils of Chrysippus, he entirely abstained from bloodletting. He was, perhaps, the brother of Cretoxena, the mother of Erasistratus, but could <b>not</b> have been <b>much</b> <b>older.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the September 3, 2013 {{issue of}} the Annals of Internal Medicine, bioethicist Scott Halpern wrote the {{following}} regarding the decision to give Murnaghan receiving an adult lung {{as a result of}} Judge Michael Baylson's restraining order against the DHHS: [...] "This intervention sets a troubling precedent. The court did not seek evidence to assess the merit of the age-discrimination claim...The rule undoubtedly disadvantaged Murnaghan, but the court's response exalted her and another child above a national policy, suggesting either failure to recognize that preferential treatment for some recipients will adversely affect others (who may <b>not</b> be <b>much</b> <b>older</b> than 12) or that the court considered these 2 children's lives more valuable than others’. Neither of these explanations is satisfying." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{example of}} union, however, {{is not the}} example which I propose to take of the {{ingrained}} futility and deception underlying all the assumptions of the modern practical politician. I wish to speak especially of another and much more general delusion. It pervades the minds and speeches of all the practical men of all parties; {{and it is a}} childish blunder built upon a single false metaphor. I refer to the universal modern talk about young nations and new nations; about America being young, about New Zealand being new. The whole thing is a trick of words. America is not young, New Zealand is not new. It is a very discussable question whether they are <b>not</b> both <b>much</b> <b>older</b> than England or Ireland.|$|R
60|$|Pierston sighed, for emotionally he was <b>not</b> <b>much</b> <b>older</b> than she. That hitch in his development, {{rendering}} him {{the most}} lopsided of God's creatures, was his standing misfortune. A proposal to her which crossed his mind was dismissed as disloyalty, particularly to an inexperienced fellow-islander and one who was by race and traditions almost a kinswoman.|$|E

"Emerson Eames was an {{eccentric}} in many ways, but his throne in philosophy and metaphysics was of international eminence; the university {{could hardly have}} afforded to lose him, and, moreover, a don has only to continue any of his bad habits {{long enough to make}} them a part of the British Constitution.

60|$|Under {{cover of}} this mirth, Prestongrange got forth of the chamber, and I was left, {{like a fish}} upon dry land, in that very {{unsuitable}} society. I could never deny, in looking back upon what followed, that I was eminently stockish; and I must say the ladies were well drilled to have so long a patience with me. The aunt indeed sat close at her embroidery, only looking now and again and smiling; but the misses, and especially the eldest, who was besides the most handsome, paid me a score of attentions which I was very ill able to repay. It was all in vain to tell myself I was a young fellow of some worth {{as well as a}} good estate, and had no call to feel abashed before these lasses, the eldest <b>not</b> so <b>much</b> <b>older</b> than myself, and no one of them by any probability half as learned.
