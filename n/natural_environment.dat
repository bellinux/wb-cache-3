40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} has demonstrated that exposure to nature benefits people in a multitude of ways. After reviewing the research on this topic, we found little information about what motivates people to seek out <b>natural</b> <b>environments.</b> In order to obtain information on why people seek out <b>natural</b> <b>environments,</b> we asked participants to respond to an open-ended question, “People seek out <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> for many reasons. Please describe why you seek out natural environments”. We then developed a coding system that allowed us to code the reasons participants gave for seeking out <b>natural</b> <b>environments.</b> We then used a pilot study to test and refine our coding system. This process resulted in twelve codes that were used to code participants’ reasons for seeking <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> in our study. We then compared the reasons people seek out <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> with several published scales measuring different aspects of human-nature connections...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the study}} was to more clearly {{investigate}} the relation between reasons people seek outdoor environments and the potential restoration those environments may offer. The Perceived Restoration Scale (PRS) is based on Kaplan & Kaplan’s (1995) attention restoration theory (ART), which states that any prolonged mental effort leads to fatigue of focused attentional capacity. Environments including certain components foster restoration of the ability to focus attention because they hold non-taxing attention, and <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> are thought to hold many of these components inherently. The reasons participants gave for seeking out <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> were compared to their scores on the five subscales—or components—of the PRS (fascination, being away, compatibility, coherence, and scope). Participants seeking <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> for connection purposes reported <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> as more restorative than participants seeking <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> for recreational reasons...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> for recreation among immigrants and factors that led to changes {{in their use of}} <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> between home and host countries. The data were collected through individual interviews with 13 Latino and 13 Chinese immigrants in the U. S., 15 Ukrainian and 11 Vietnamese immigrants in Poland, 9 Moroccan immigrants in the Netherlands and 9 Turkish immigrants in Germany. The findings show that changes in the use of <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> for recreation are related to different types of nature in home and host countries, access-related issues, quality of <b>natural</b> <b>environments,</b> work focus among immigrants, transportation problems, cultural differences, lack of knowledge of opportunities, life stage and ageing. Based on the findings, we develop a model that outlines different types of interaction with <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> among immigrants following their settlement in the host countries...|$|R
5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|A {{realignment}} of {{the highway}} between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which would see the road deviate to the west at Newman, and travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar. In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated by Main Roads. The potential impacts on the <b>natural</b> <b>environment,</b> regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range.|$|E

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>environments,</b> namely {{green and}} blue spaces, {{have been found to}} have {{positive}} influences on mental health outcomes globally. As the contribution of poor mental health to the disease burden increases, the mechanisms through which <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> may improve health are of growing importance. This study creates a novel visibility index methodology and investigates whether i) views of <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> and ii) access to <b>natural</b> <b>environments,</b> are associated with psychological stress and physical activity in Wellington, New Zealand. It also builds upon the work conducted in New Zealand as the first study to investigate links between blue space and mental health and provides an insight into the mechanisms through which increased <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> may improve health. Individual level data for 442 individuals from the New Zealand Health Survey was obtained and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were used to investigate whether area-level exposure to <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> influenced their psychological stress and levels of physical activity. Results from regression analysis indicate that increased distant visible green space (beyond 3 km), visible blue space, and a combination of {{green and blue}} spaces from neighbourhood centroids reduce psychological stress. Some access measures to <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> were found to have positive associations with psychological stress, however increased proximal access to green space was associated with decreased physical activity. The findings conclude that the visibility of <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> appears to have stronger associations with stress reduction than access to them. The findings of this paper should influence urban development and inform decision and policy making, particularly the development and/or relocation of health related facilities...|$|R
40|$|People may {{behave in}} {{environmentally}} friendly ways because they gain psychologically from {{their experiences in}} <b>natural</b> <b>environments.</b> Psychological benefits of nature experience may also underlie concerns about personally harmful effects of environmental problems. Cross-sectional survey data from 1413 Norwegian adults {{were used to assess}} the relationship between use of <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> for psychological restoration and ecological behaviour, as mediated by personal environmental concern. Mediation tests with hierarchical regression analyses provided evidence of partial mediation; the use of <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> for restoration remained a significant predictor of ecological behaviour after the entry of environmental concern into the analysis. These associations held independently of age, gender, education, household income, size of community of upbringing, size of community of current residence and distance of current residence from an outdoor recreation area. Among sociodemographic variables, only gender had a significant associationwith the use of <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> for restoration, suggesting that their use transcends several important social categories in Norway. In short, positive experiences in <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> may promote ecological behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{inactivity}} and disconnection from <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> threatens human health. However, {{research has}} demonstrated that <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> potentially support health-enhancing physical activity which could confer greater physical and mental health benefits than physical activity in other types of environment. This thesis approached the study of physical activity in <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> through three related pieces of research. Firstly, an experimental study was carried out to explore how the presence of litter in beach environments affected psychophysiological responses to exercise. Responses to exercise did not differ in littered and clean conditions but there was evidence that order effects influenced findings. Visual attention to the two scenes differed, but did not mediate differences in psychophysiological responses. Secondly, analysis of a national dataset was undertaken to explore the form and quantity of physical activity conducted within <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> in England. A series of linear regressions revealed that higher-intensity physical activities occurred in countryside environments, but more total energy expenditure occurred in coastal environments. Thirdly, a quantitative content analysis of brochures which promote recreational walking in <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> was conducted which investigated their use of persuasive behavioural messages. These brochures omitted behavioural techniques which may be effective at motivating inactive individuals to walk. Extending this, an online survey tested whether improving brochure content heightened intentions to walk in <b>natural</b> <b>environments.</b> By designing content based on the theory of planned behaviour, the intentions of inactive individuals to undertake walking in <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> were increased. The findings from this thesis demonstrate that the protection of <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> is vital for preserving and promoting active recreation and could contribute to population-level increases in physical activity with theory-based promotion in the future.
