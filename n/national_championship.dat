5|$|By contract, the top {{two teams}} in the BCS Poll at the {{conclusion}} of the regular season were invited to the BCS <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> game. In 2000, the BCS Poll was a combination of four different systems: media and coaches' polls (Associated Press college football poll and USA Today Coaches' Poll), team records, a collection of eight different computer ranking systems, and a strength-of-schedule component based on opponent records. Under the BCS, the site of the <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> game rotated every year. In 2000, there were four BCS bowl games: the Rose Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Orange Bowl, and the Fiesta Bowl. The <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> game rotated to a different location each year, and the other three games served as bowl games for lower-ranked teams. Later, in 2007, the BCS <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> was created, adding a fifth BCS bowl. In 2000, the Sugar Bowl was scheduled to host the <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> game.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{entered the}} 2000 college {{football}} season with hopes of following up its {{victory in the}} 2000 Sugar Bowl with another <b>national</b> <b>championship.</b> The Seminoles' regular-season performance differed slightly from 1999, as they lost a regular-season game to Miami, yet still appeared in a third consecutive <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> game: the 2001 Orange Bowl. Unlike in 2000, the Seminoles emerged on the losing side of a 132 score. Virginia Tech, like Florida State, had hoped to attend the <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> game again, but an injury to star quarterback Michael Vick caused the Hokies to lose a regular-season game at third-ranked Miami, eliminating them from <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> contention.|$|E

5|$|A {{decade after}} Virginia Tech's {{selection}} the 1995 Sugar Bowl {{and five years}} after its appearance in a Sugar Bowl game {{that served as the}} <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> game, Tech was again selected to play in New Orleans' annual Sugar Bowl game. The No. 9 Hokies finished the regular season 10–2 and won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship their first year in the conference, winning an automatic bid to the game. Facing the Hokies were the No. 3 Auburn Tigers, who had gone 12–0 during the regular season. Normally, Auburn's undefeated season would have been justification for a spot in the 2005 BCS <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> Game, but because two other teams had also gone undefeated during the regular season, Auburn, as the No. 3 team in the country, was left out of the <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> game.|$|E

In 2009, Saban led the Crimson Tide to the BCS <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> Game, and defeated Texas 37–21 to clinch the program's first national title of the BCS era. A year after Alabama defeated Michigan State in the 2011 Capital One Bowl, the Crimson Tide defeated LSU in the BCS <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> Game to clinch the program's second national title of the BCS era. The following season, the Crimson Tide won their second consecutive BCS <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> Game by a final score of 42–14 over Notre Dame. In their latest bowl appearance, Alabama lost to Clemson in the College Football Playoff <b>National</b> <b>Championship.</b> The loss brought Alabama's overall bowl record to 39wins, 26 losses and 3ties, placing the Crimson Tide in first place among all FBS schools for both bowl appearances and victories.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{prior to the}} Sugar Bowl, media {{attention}} focused on Virginia Tech's sudden rise to national prominence and Florida State's perennial appearance in the <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> game. The Seminoles had the most top-5 finishes and the most <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> game appearances of any team in the 1990s, including a <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> victory in 1993. Many media stories focused on the apparent David and Goliath showdown between the two teams, with the Seminoles {{in the role of}} the overdog and the Hokies {{in the role of the}} underdog. Because of this fact, spread bettors favored Florida State to win the game by 5.5points.|$|E

5|$|Note: {{before the}} 1974 season, the final Coaches Poll, also known {{then as the}} UPI Poll, was {{released}} before the bowl games, so a team that lost its bowl game could still claim the UPI <b>national</b> <b>championship.</b> This was changed {{as a result of}} Alabama winning the 1973 Coaches Poll <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> despite losing to Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E

In the weeks that led up to the game, the notion of a split <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> became a major storyline. This was the case as the AP Poll is not tied to the Bowl Championship Series and some AP voters expressed they might vote LSU national champions even if they lost as they defeated Alabama in their regular season game. However, after Alabama shut out LSU 21–0 in the BCS <b>National</b> <b>Championship</b> Game, the AP voted them national champions to give the Crimson Tide the consensus <b>national</b> <b>championship</b> and thus avoid a split title with LSU.|$|E
