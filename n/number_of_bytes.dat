25|$|A {{host device}} can ask any {{inserted}} SD card for its 128-bit identification string (the Card-Specific Data or CSD). In standard-capacity cards (SDSC), 12 bits identify {{the number of}} memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 bits identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster). The host device multiplies these figures (as shown in the following section) with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bytes</b> per block to determine the card's capacity in bytes.|$|E
25|$|The vehicle {{responds}} to the PID query on the CAN bus with message IDs that depend on which module responded. Typically the engine or main ECU responds at ID 7E8h.

Even though the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bytes</b> in the returned value is variable, the message uses 8 data bytes regardless (CAN bus protocol form Frameformat with 8 data bytes).|$|E
50|$|The inbound phase will {{typically}} {{have a few}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> active state <b>bytes</b> (bytes with non-zero differences) at the beginning, which then propagate to a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> active <b>bytes</b> {{in the middle of}} the round, before returning to a low <b>number</b> <b>of</b> active <b>bytes</b> at the end of the phase. The idea is to have the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> active <b>bytes</b> at the input and output of an S-Box {{in the middle of the}} phase. Characteristics can then be efficiently computed by choosing values for the differences at the start and end of the inbound phase, propagating these towards the middle, and looking for matches in the input and output of the S-Box. For AES like ciphers this can typically be done row- or column-wise, making the procedure relatively efficient. Choosing different starting and ending values leads to many different differential characteristics in the inbound phase.|$|R

25|$|Fortran {{sequential}} unformatted files {{created with}} one endianness usually cannot be read {{on a system}} using the other endianness because Fortran usually implements a record (defined as the data written by a single Fortran statement) as data preceded and succeeded by count fields, which are integers equal to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bytes</b> in the data. An attempt to read such file on a system of the other endianness then results in a run-time error, because the count fields are incorrect. This problem can be avoided by writing out sequential binary files as opposed to sequential unformatted.|$|E
25|$|The gross {{capacity}} of older HDDs is calculated {{as the product}} of the number of cylinders per recording zone, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bytes</b> per sector (most commonly 512), and the count of zones of the drive. Some modern SATA drives also report cylinder-head-sector (CHS) capacities, but these are not physical parameters because the reported values are constrained by historic operating system interfaces. The C/H/S scheme has been replaced by logical block addressing (LBA), a simple linear addressing scheme that locates blocks by an integer index, which starts at LBA 0 for the first block and increments thereafter. When using the C/H/S method to describe modern large drives, the number of heads is often set to 64, although a typical hard disk drive, , has between one and four platters.|$|E
25|$|While the CRIME {{attack was}} {{presented}} as a general attack that could work effectively against {{a large number of}} protocols, including but not limited to TLS, and application-layer protocols such as SPDY or HTTP, only exploits against TLS and SPDY were demonstrated and largely mitigated in browsers and servers. The CRIME exploit against HTTP compression has not been mitigated at all, even though the authors of CRIME have warned that this vulnerability might be even more widespread than SPDY and TLS compression combined. In 2013 a new instance of the CRIME attack against HTTP compression, dubbed BREACH, was announced. Based on the CRIME attack a BREACH attack can extract login tokens, email addresses or other sensitive information from TLS encrypted web traffic in as little as 30 seconds (depending on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bytes</b> to be extracted), provided the attacker tricks the victim into visiting a malicious web link or is able to inject content into valid pages the user is visiting (ex: a wireless network {{under the control of the}} attacker). All versions of TLS and SSL are at risk from BREACH regardless of the encryption algorithm or cipher used. Unlike previous instances of CRIME, which can be successfully defended against by turning off TLS compression or SPDY header compression, BREACH exploits HTTP compression which cannot realistically be turned off, as virtually all web servers rely upon it to improve data transmission speeds for users. This is a known limitation of TLS as it is susceptible to chosen-plaintext attack against the application-layer data it was meant to protect.|$|E

50|$|A variable-width {{encoding}} {{is a type}} {{of character}} encoding scheme in which codes of differing lengths are used to encode a character set (a repertoire of symbols) for representation in a computer. Most common variable-width encodings are multibyte encodings, which use varying <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>bytes</b> (octets) to encode different characters.(Some authors, notably in Microsoft documentation, use the term multibyte character set, which is a misnomer, because representation size is an attribute of the encoding, not of the character set).|$|R

This rule maintains a one-to-one correspondence between code points and their valid encodings, {{so that there is}} a unique valid encoding for each code point. This ensures that string comparisons and searches are well-defined.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} Coded relay (Crelay) in multi-hop {{wireless}} networks. Crelay exploits both partial packets and overhearing {{capabilities of the}} wireless nodes, and uses Forward Error Correction code in packet forwarding. When a node overhears a partial packet from an upstream node, it informs the upstream node about the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> parity <b>bytes</b> needed to correct the errors, such that the upstream node need only send a small amount <b>of</b> parity <b>bytes</b> instead <b>of</b> the complete packet, hence improving the network efficiency. Our main contributions include the following. First, we propose an efficient network protocol that can exploit partial packets and overhearing. Second, we study the routing problem in networks with Crelay and propose a greedy algorithm for finding the paths. Third, we propose an error ratio estimator, called AMPS, that can estimate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>byte</b> errors in a received frame with good accuracy at a low overhead <b>of</b> only 8 <b>bytes</b> per frame, where the estimator is needed for a node to find the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> needed parity <b>bytes.</b> Fourth, we implement the proposed protocol and algorithm within the Click modular router, and our experiments show that Crelay can significantly improve the performance of wireless networks...|$|R
40|$|Researchers are {{designing}} new MANET {{routing protocols}} and comparing and improving existing MANET routing protocols before any routing protocols are standardized using simulations. However, the simulation results from different research groups are {{not consistent with}} each other. This is {{because of a lack}} of consistency in MANET routing protocol models and application environments, including networking and user traffic profiles. Therefore, the simulation scenarios are not equitable for all protocols and conclusions cannot be generalized. Furthermore, it is difficult for one to choose a proper routing protocol for a given MANET application. In this paper Investigators for experimental purpose, considered 10 and 20 multiple random wireless nodes in 250 mx 250 m terrain area and routing protocol DSR and find out the various simulation results like: <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> generated packets, sent packets, received, forward, dropped packet, Maximum and minimum generated packets size, Simulation length in seconds, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> generated <b>bytes,</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sent <b>bytes,</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> received and forward <b>bytes.</b> <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> drop <b>bytes...</b>|$|R
