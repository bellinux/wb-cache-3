40|$|Hip {{resurfacing}} is {{an effective}} treatment modality for arthritis of the hip in carefully selected patients; however, its use remains controversial due to its higher revision rates compared with conventional total hip replacement surgery. The most frequent reason for revision is femoral neck fracture, and preoperative bone mineral density {{is an important factor}} when considering the option of hip resurfacing. Whilst reduction in bone mineral density following total hip replacement is well documented, {{little is known about the}} long-term changes in femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> mineral density after hip resurfacing. We followed 15 patients (ten male and five female) who underwent unilateral hip resurfacing for osteoarthritis with standardised dual energy X-ray absorbiometry scans at two weeks, three months, one year, two years and five years postoperatively to determine changes in the femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> mineral density. Both males and females initially had decreases in bone mineral density at three months postoperatively, but had gradual mean increases to 119 % of their initial measurements by five years. This study demonstrates that femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> mineral density increases after hip resurfacing and that this increase continues for at least five years. Charles A. Willis-Owen, Henry D.

With homozygous mutation C 282 Y, the increase in serum ferritin may {{be associated}} with tissue damage in the liver, pancreas, and pituitary and with a reduced bone mineral density. With heterozygous mutation C 282 Y, the degree of iron retention is less but information relating to how a heterozygous C 282 Y mutation might impact bone mineral density is uncertain. The present study was undertaken to study the relationships between bone mineral density measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and the serum ferritin and serum iron in postmenopausal women heterozygous for the C 282 Y mutation. The spinal bone mineral density, L 2 – 4, was significantly less than age matched community controls (P= 0. 016). There was no significant change in the femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> mineral density compared to age matched community controls. The correlation between the spinal bone mineral density, L 2 – 4, the femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> mineral density, and the serum ferritin was not significant. The serum iron correlated significantly inversely with the femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> mineral density (P= 0. 048).

40|$|Poor femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> {{geometry}} at the femur is {{an important}} risk factor for hip fracture. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> geometry, examining approximately 379, 000 eligible single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1000 Caucasians. A common genetic variant, rs 7430431 in the receptor transporting protein 3 (RTP 3) gene, was identified in strong association with the buckling ratio (BR, P = 1. 6 × 10 − 7), an index of bone structural instability, and with femoral cortical thickness (CT, P = 1. 9 × 10 − 6). The RTP 3 gene is located in 3 p 21. 31, a region that we found to be linked with CT (LOD = 2. 19, P = 6. 0 × 10 − 4) in 3998 individuals from 434 pedigrees. The replication analyses in 1488 independent Caucasians and 2118 Chinese confirmed the association of rs 7430431 to BR and CT (combined P = 7. 0 × 10 − 3 for BR and P = 1. 4 × 10 − 2 for CT). In addition, 350 hip fracture patients and 350 healthy control individuals were genotyped to assess the association of the RTP 3 gene with the risk of hip fracture. Significant association between a nearby common SNP, rs 10514713 of the RTP 3 gene, and hip fracture (P = 1. 0 × 10 − 3) was found.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Numerous {{reports in}} the {{literature}} refer to the femoral neck fracture rate in hip resurfacing. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the bone mineral density and evidence of stress shielding around the femoral component of the Birmingham resurfacing prosthesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with primary unilateral osteoarthritis had a Birmingham resurfacing prosthesis. DEXA analysis of the proximal femur and femoral neck was performed and compared with the opposite unaffected side. RESULTS: Total periprosthetic bone mineral density was 0. 49 % greater than the control, but this did not achieve statistical significance. Although the BMD of the femoral neck was slightly increased on the prosthetic side (1. 002 g/cm 2) as opposed to the control side, this difference did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The Birmingham resurfacing prosthesis does not appear to reduce femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> mineral density in comparison to the normal femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> density. We conclude that femoral neck fractures are unlikely to be due to stress shielding related to the prosthesis...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of high-impact exercise on bone mineral mass and strength, and on knee cartilage composition in postmenopausal women with mild knee osteoarthritis (OA). In addition, the association between knee OA and femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> structural characteristics in women with mild knee radiographic OA and those without radiographic knee OA was studied. Also, the reproducibility of measuring human knee joint cartilage by the delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI (dGEMRIC) technique was determined in healthy asymptomatic subjects. Data from a 12 -month randomized controlled trial (RCT) was used to assess the effects of exercise on bones and cartilages. The training intervention comprised 80 postmenopausal women with mild knee OA. The primary outcomes were bone mineral mass and strength, and the biochemical composition of knee cartilage as assessed by quantitative MRI measures: dGEMRIC and T 2 relaxation time. Physical performance-related risk factors of falling were also evaluated. Data assembled from an additional sample of postmenopausal women with no knee symptoms (n = 12) and from the baseline measures of the postmenopausal women with mild knee OA were used in the cross-sectional association study. Prior to RCT, a test-retest study was conducted in healthy subjects (n = 10) to assess the reproducibility of dGEMRIC. The dGEMRIC technique showed good day-to-day reproducibility for the different knee cartilage regions. In the association study, femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> characteristics were significantly higher with higher grades in radiographic knee OA, indicating an inverse relationship between OA and osteoporosis (OP). The exercise program increased femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> mineral mass and strength. Exercise also had positive effects on physical performance-related risk factors for falls and exercise participation was well endured. However, the exercise had no effect on knee cartilage composition. To conclude, progressively implemented high-impact training is a safe and feasible exercise modality in the prevention of OP and physical performance–related risk factors for falls in postmenopausal women with mild knee OA...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} radiographically-assessed knee osteoarthritis and femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> characteristics in women with mild knee radiographic osteoarthritis and those without radiographic osteoarthritis. Methods: Ninety postmenopausal women (mean age [SD], 58 [4] years; height, 163 [6] cm; weight, 71 [11] kg) participated in this cross-sectional study. The severity of radiographic knee osteoarthritis was defined using Kellgren-Lawrence grades 0 =normal (n= 12), 1 =doubtful (n= 25) or 2 =minimal (n= 53). Femoral <b>neck</b> <b>bone</b> mineral content (BMC), section modulus (Z), and cross-sectional area (CSA) were measured with DXA. The biochemical composition of ipsilateral knee cartilage was estimated using quantitative MRI measures, T 2 mapping and dGEMRIC. The associations between radiographic knee osteoarthritis grades and bone and cartilage characteristics were analyzed using generalized linear models. Results: Age-, height-, and weight-adjusted femoral neck BMC (p for linearity= 0. 019), Z (p for linearity= 0. 033), and CSA (p for linearity= 0. 019) increased significantly with higher knee osteoarthritis grades. There was no linear relationship between osteoarthritis grades and knee cartilage indices. Conclusions: Increased DXAassessed hip bone strength isrelated to knee osteoarthritis severity.
