40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{discussions of}} the ethics of human gene therapy, it has become {{standard}} to draw {{a distinction between the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> human gene transfer tech-niques to treat health problems and their use to enhance or improve normal human traits. Some dispute the normative force of this distinction by arguing that it is undercut by the legitimate medical <b>use</b> <b>of</b> human gene transfer tech-niques to prevent disease- such as genetic engineering to bolster immune func-tion, improve the efficiency of DNA repair, or add cellular receptors to capture and process cholesterol. If disease prevention is a proper goal of medicine, these critics argue, and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> gene transfer techniques to enhance human health maintenance capacities will help achieve that goal, then the "treatment/enhance-ment " distinction cannot define the limits of legitimate gene therapy. In this paper, I argue that a line can be drawn between prevention and enhancement for gene therapy (and thus between properly medical and <b>nonmedical</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> gene therapy), but only if one is willing to accept two rather old-fashioned claims: 1) Some health problems are best understood as if they were entities in their own right, reifiable as processes or parts in a biological system, with at least as much ontological objectivity and theoretical significance as the functions that they inhibit. 2) Legitimate preventive genetic health care should be limited to efforts to defend people from attack by these more robust pathological entities, rather than changing their bodies to evade social injustices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> (NMU) <b>of</b> prescription attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications is rising, but many previous investigations have used clinical or regionally based samples or limited their investigations to stimulants rather than to medications specifically used to treat ADHD. Using an Internet-based epidemiological survey, this paper advances understanding of the prevalence and correlates of NMU <b>of</b> medications <b>used</b> to treat ADHD, sources of diverted medications, motivations for use, and consumption patterns. Methods The study used a self-administered Internet survey of civilian, noninstitutionalized adults (N = 4, 297) aged 18 to 49 in the United States. National-level estimates were created using propensity scoring methods and weighting procedures using data from three nationally representative probability surveys: a random-digit dialed telephone survey, the current U. S. Census, and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Results Past-year prevalence of NMU of ADHD medications was approximately 2 %, with 4. 3 % reported among those aged 18 to 25 and 1. 3 % among those aged 26 to 49. Most respondents reporting NMU used on multiple occasions. Receipt of medications for ADHD was a significant correlate of past-year NMU, though most nonmedical users never had a prescription. Among persons {{who had never been}} prescribed medication to treat ADHD, friends or family members were the most common source. Productivity was the most frequently endorsed reason for NMU. Alcohol was the substance most commonly used in combination with ADHD drugs. Conclusion Because most prescription ADHD medications currently are highly regulated, policy options for supply-side reduction <b>of</b> <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> may include identifying those medications with lower abuse liability for inclusion on insurance formularies. Patient and physician education programs also may be useful tools to heighten awareness of intentional and unintentional diversion of ADHD medications for nonmedical purposes. </p...|$|R

Recent {{research indicates that}} symptoms persist into adulthood {{in the majority of}} cases, with prevalence estimates of approximately 5 % in the school age population and 2. 5 %– 4 % in the adult population. Although students with ADHD are at greater risk for academic underachievement and psychosocial problems, increasing numbers of students with ADHD are graduating from high school and pursuing higher education. Stimulant medications are considered the first line of pharmacotherapy for individuals with ADHD, including college students. Although preliminary evidence indicates that prescription stimulants are safe and effective for college students with ADHD when used as prescribed, very few controlled studies have been conducted concerning the efficacy of prescription stimulants with college students. In addition, misuse of prescription stimulants has become a serious problem on college campuses across the US and has been recently documented in other countries as well. The purpose of the present systematic review was to investigate the efficacy of prescription stimulants for adolescents and young adults with ADHD and the <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> and misuse <b>of</b> prescription stimulants. Results revealed that both prostimulant and stimulant medications, including lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, methylphenidate, amphetamines, and mixed-amphetamine salts, are effective at reducing ADHD symptoms in adolescents and adults with ADHD.

Surveys such as monitoring the future (MTF) and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) are important tools for understanding trends in abuse of prescription and illegal drugs. This report compares discrepancies in prevalence between these surveys for a specific opioid product (oxycodone) relative to other drugs. MethodsTrends in past-year use of marijuana, cocaine, and <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> oxycodone and any prescription pain reliever were estimated for each survey for a five year period (2005 – 2010) for adolescents in 12 th grade. The proportion of nonmedical pain reliever users who abused oxycodone was estimated for each survey. ResultsPrevalence of past-year oxycodone nonmedical use was steady over time for both surveys, but 2. 5 – 3 times higher in the MTF compared to the NSDUH. Trends in prevalence of marijuana and cocaine use were similar across surveys, although prevalence estimates for each were on average 18 % higher in the MTF. In contrast, prevalence estimates for any nonmedical prescription pain reliever use were on average 15 % lower in MTF.

Methods—A list of keywords regarding the <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical opioids was used to conduct systematic searches in PubMed®. Filtration of search results generated 92 peer-reviewed academic articles, published between January 1995 and April 2012, {{as well as a number}} of primary data sources. Lists of topics were developed independently by two researchers which were later compared and consolidated. All sources were then categorized according to their relevance to each of these topics and according to their capacity for geographical and longitudinal trend analysis. Results—Tables cataloging data sources can be used to identify data relevant to specific topics in diversion, nonmedical use, and adverse outcomes associated with pharmaceutical opioids, and they illustrate global trends in data coverage, identifying several topics that have minimal data.

Conclusions—The categorization of data sources is hoped to facilitate ongoing research, analysis, and evaluation of this public health problem by serving as a guide for researchers, policy makers, and others who seek data regarding the <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical opioids in the United States...|$|E
2500|$|Nootropics (English pronunciation: [...] ), {{also known}} as smart drugs and {{cognitive}} enhancers, are drugs, supplements, and other substances that improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation, in healthy individuals. The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> cognition-enhancing drugs by healthy individuals {{in the absence of}} a medical indication is one of the most debated topics among neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and physicians which spans a number of issues, including the ethics and fairness <b>of</b> their <b>use,</b> concerns over adverse effects, and the diversion of prescription drugs for <b>nonmedical</b> <b>uses,</b> among others. [...] Nonetheless, the international sales of cognition-enhancing supplements exceeded [...] billion in 2015 and the global demand for these compounds is still growing rapidly. The most commonly <b>used</b> class <b>of</b> drug is stimulants, such as caffeine.|$|R
25|$|The racemic parent {{compound}} racemorphan was first {{described in a}} Swiss and US patent application from Hoffmann-La Roche in 1946 and 1947, respectively; a patent was granted in 1950. A resolution of the two isomers of racemorphan with tartaric acid was published in 1952, and DXM was successfully tested in 1954 as part of US Navy and CIA-funded research on nonaddictive substitutes for codeine. DXM {{was approved by the}} FDA in 1958 as an over-the-counter antitussive. As had been initially hoped, DXM was a solution for some of the problems associated with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> codeine phosphate as a cough suppressant, such as sedation and opiate dependence, but like the dissociative anesthetics phencyclidine and ketamine, DXM later became associated with <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{incidence}} of nonmedical ketamine {{has increased in}} the context of raves and other parties. However, its emergence as a club drug differs from other club drugs (e.g. MDMA) due to its anesthetic properties (e.g., slurred speech, immobilization) at higher doses; in addition, there are reports of ketamine being sold as [...] "ecstasy". The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> ketamine as part of a [...] "postclubbing experience" [...] has also been documented. Ketamine's rise in the dance culture was rapid in Hong Kong {{by the end of the}} 1990s. Before becoming a federally controlled substance in the United States in 1999, ketamine was available as diverted pharmaceutical preparations and as a pure powder sold in bulk quantities from domestic chemical supply companies. Much of the current ketamine diverted for <b>nonmedical</b> <b>use</b> originates in China and India.|$|R
