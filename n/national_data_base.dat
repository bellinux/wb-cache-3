5000|$|In 1988, he {{was invited}} by the Massachusetts Medical Society, which publishes the New England Journal of Medicine, to deliver their annual Shattuck Lecture. He called for [...] "a <b>national</b> <b>data</b> <b>base</b> {{containing}} information and analysis on clinical, financial, and health outcomes that estimates {{as best we can}} the relation between medical interventions and health outcomes, as well as the relation between health outcomes and money." [...] He envisioned a sort of health plan [...] "report card" [...] that would allow patients to make informed choices among health plans based on health outcomes for specific conditions and patients’ reports of their satisfaction. He argues that there is extraordinary variation in the quality-performance of different doctors and health institutions, yet patients, insurers, policymakers and even other doctors have few tools for assessing quality. Similarly, doctors and patients often choose medical interventions with only limited information about the effectiveness of various treatments and how they impact patients’ quality of life; a health outcomes data base would vastly improve the information available when making such decisions. Finally, a health outcomes data-base would guide policymakers and large providers in the overall design of health systems. The Mayo Clinic and some health providers have begun to experiment with outcomes management.|$|E

40|$|Interim {{national}} standard procedures for deriving per-student costs in postsecondary educational institutions {{are discussed in}} this staff paper. The interim procedures are intended to develop a <b>national</b> <b>data</b> <b>base</b> on the average annual cost per-student by level of instruction and field of study. The proposed procedures classify students by level-lower division, upper division, and graduate, and by field of study, according to the four digit discipline code of the HEGIS Taxonomy of Instruction Programs. Direct costs are aggregated by department and distributed to level of instruction {{on the basis of}} faculty assignment. Indirect costs are allocated to the departments by a specified allocation procedure. The resulting instructional unit costs are related to student majors by the induced course load matrix, which yields the average annual full cost per student by level of student and field of study. Once each participating institution determines its average annual full cost-per-student data, such data could be contributed to a <b>national</b> <b>data</b> <b>base,</b> along with explanatory materials that briefly characterize the students and the institutions.
