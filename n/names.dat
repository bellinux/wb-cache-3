In 1880, the word Armenia was banned from use in the press, schoolbooks, and governmental establishments, to be replaced with words like Anatolia or Kurdistan.

It included the Turkification of last <b>names,</b> change of animal <b>names,</b> change of the <b>names</b> of Armenian historical figures (i.e. {{the name of the}} prominent Balyan family was concealed under the identity of a superficial Italian family called Baliani), and the change and distortion of Armenian historical events.|$|E

5|$|During 1957, hurricanes {{that formed}} east of 140°W {{were not given}} <b>names</b> by the local warning center. Those that either crossed or formed west of that point were named by the National Weather Bureau in Honolulu, Hawaii.

5|$|During {{its annual}} session in 2000, the WMO/ESCAP Panel on North Indian Tropical Cyclones agreed in {{principle}} to start assigning <b>names</b> to cyclonic storms that developed within the North Indian Ocean. As a result of this, the panel requested that each member country submit a list of ten <b>names</b> to a rapporteur {{by the end of}} 2000. At the 2001 session, the rapporteur reported that of the eight countries involved, only India had refused to submit a list of <b>names,</b> as it had some reservations about assigning <b>names</b> to tropical cyclones. The panel then studied the <b>names</b> and felt that some of the <b>names</b> would not be appealing to the public or the media and thus requested that members submit new lists of <b>names.</b> During 2002 the rapporteur reported {{that there had been a}} poor response by member countries in resubmitting their lists of <b>names.</b> Over the next year, each country except India submitted a fresh list. By the 2004 session, India had still not submitted its list despite promising to do so. However, the rapporteur presented the lists of <b>names</b> that would be used with a gap left for India's <b>names.</b> The rapporteur also recommended that the naming lists be used on an experimental basis during the season, starting in May or June 2004. The naming lists were then completed in May 2004, after India submitted their <b>names.</b> However, the lists were not used until September 2004, when the first tropical cyclone was named Onil by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).|$|E
