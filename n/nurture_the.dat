5|$|Major {{themes in}} the series deal with adventure, {{forbidden}} love, the concept of nature vs. <b>nurture,</b> <b>the</b> reactions of different faiths meeting each other, and characters being a mix of good and bad. The authors draw inspiration from several natural locations and other authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, J. K. Rowling, and William Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|The intense {{international}} exchange produced several cosmopolitan humanist scholars, including Francisco de Holanda, André de Resende and Damião de Góis, {{a friend of}} Erasmus who wrote with rare independence on the reign of King Manuel I. Diogo and André de Gouveia made relevant teaching reforms via France. Foreign news and products in the Portuguese factory in Antwerp attracted the interest of Thomas More and Dürer to the wider world. There, profits and know-how helped <b>nurture</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Renaissance and Golden Age, especially after {{the arrival of the}} wealthy cultured Jewish community expelled from Portugal.|$|E
5|$|As a showman, Butlin {{quickly became}} successful, one stall {{becoming}} several, and several becoming his own travelling fair. Butlin soon had fixed fairground sites {{as well as}} his travelling fair – the first was at Olympia in London outside Bertram Mills' Circus. In 1925 he opened a set of fairground stalls in Barry Island, Wales where he observed the way landladies in seaside resorts would (sometimes literally) push families out of the lodgings between meals, and began to <b>nurture</b> <b>the</b> idea of a holiday camp similar to the one he had attended whilst an employee at Eatons.|$|E

25|$|Science {{fiction has}} used cloning, most {{commonly}} and specifically human cloning, {{due to the}} fact that it brings up controversial questions of identity. A Number is a 2002 play by English playwright Caryl Churchill which addresses the subject of human cloning and identity, especially nature and <b>nurture.</b> <b>The</b> story, set in the near future, is structured around the conflict between a father (Salter) and his sons (Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black) – two of whom are clones of the first one. A Number was adapted by Caryl Churchill for television, in a co-production between the BBC and HBO Films.|$|E
25|$|Although {{scientists}} favor biological {{models for}} the cause of sexual orientation, they do not believe that it is the result of any one factor. They generally believe that it is determined by biological and environmental factors; they state that most people's sexual orientation is determined at an early age, and sexual orientation development involves a complex interplay between nature and <b>nurture.</b> <b>The</b> biological factors are genetic and hormonal, both of which affect the fetal development of the brain, while environmental factors may be sociological, psychological, or involve the early uterine environment. Scientists generally do not believe that sexual orientation is a matter of choice.|$|E
25|$|The Young and Teen Writers' Workshops are summer {{creative}} writing workshops for area {{high school and}} middle school students.

The Young workshops are grades 5–8 and the teen workshops are grades 9–12 and incoming college freshman. The Young workshops are in their 33rd year and the Teen workshops have been going for ten years now. Courses offered are fiction, poetry, creative non-fiction, and dramatic writing. The current director is Bill Lawrence.|$|E

25|$|Through the {{compilation}} {{and analysis}} of a database of nearly three dozen birds and reptiles, and comparison with existing data about the anatomy of Coelophysis Rinehart et al. (2009) drew the following conclusions. It was estimated that average egg of Coelophysis was 31-33.5 millimeters across its minor diameter, and that each female would lay between 24-26 eggs in each clutch. The evidence suggested that some parental care was necessary to <b>nurture</b> <b>the</b> relatively small hatchlings {{during the first year}} of life, where they would reach 1.5 meters in length by the end of their first growth stage. Coelophysis bauri invested as much energy in reproduction as other extinct reptiles of its approximate size.|$|E
25|$|Assessing the {{relative}} importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on nature and <b>nurture.</b> <b>The</b> question of whether more extinctions in the fossil record have been caused by evolution or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion; Mark Newman, the author of Modeling Extinction, argues for a mathematical model that falls between the two positions. By contrast, conservation biology uses the extinction vortex model to classify extinctions by cause. When concerns about human extinction have been raised, for example in Sir Martin Rees' 2003 book Our Final Hour, those concerns lie with the effects of climate change or technological disaster.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, for example, the moetzes {{issued a}} written ruling forbidding Orthodox rabbis {{to join with}} any Reform or Conservative rabbis in rabbinical {{communal}} professional organizations that then united the various branches of America's Jews, such as the Synagogue Council of America. This position was not endorsed by the Modern Orthodox. Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik of Yeshiva University had initially aligned himself with Agudah, but later established his independent views on these matters {{and a host of}} other issues, such as attitudes towards college education and attitudes towards the secular-led Israeli governments. Rabbi Soloveitchik felt it important to <b>nurture</b> <b>the</b> modern Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America (RCA). However, at times, some of the more traditionalist rabbis at Yeshiva University aligned themselves with Agudah's positions.|$|E

25|$|Astrologically speaking, the Moon is {{associated}} with a person's emotional make-up, unconscious habits, rhythms, memories, moods and their ability to react and adapt to those around them. It is also associated with the mother, maternal instincts or the urge to <b>nurture,</b> <b>the</b> home, the need for security and the past, especially early experiences and childhood. The 1st-century poet Manilius described the Moon, or Luna, as melancholic. In medicine, the Moon {{is associated}} with the digestive system, stomach, breasts, the ovaries and menstruation (which does occur on a monthly cycle) and the pancreas. Despite Manilius's assignation, the Moon is commonly associated with the phlegmatic humor; it ruled the animal spirits. In modern astrology, the Moon is the primary native ruler of the fourth house, but traditionally it had its joy in the third house.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposing}} argument {{posits that}} terraforming {{would be an}} unethical interference in nature, and that given humanity's past treatment of Earth, other planets may {{be better off without}} human interference. Still others strike a middle ground, such as Christopher McKay, who argues that terraforming is ethically sound only once we have completely assured that an alien planet does not harbor life of its own; but that if it does, we should not try to reshape it to our own use, but we should engineer its environment to artificially <b>nurture</b> <b>the</b> alien life and help it thrive and co-evolve, or even co-exist with humans. Even this would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve without outside interference.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Science, Technology and Space funds {{thematic}} {{research centres}} and {{is responsible for}} international scientific co-operation. The Ministry’s National Infrastructure Programme aims to create {{a critical mass of}} knowledge in national priority fields and to <b>nurture</b> <b>the</b> younger generation of scientists. Investment in the programme mainly takes the form of research grants, scholarships and knowledge centres. Over 80% of the ministry’s budget is channelled towards research in academic institutions and research institutes, as well as towards revamping scientific infrastructure by upgrading existing research facilities and establishing new ones. In 2012, the ministry resolved to invest NIS 120 million over three years in four designated priority areas for research: brain science; supercomputing and cybersecurity; oceanography; and alternative transportation fuels. An expert panel headed by the Chief Scientist in the Ministry of Science, Technology and Space chose these four broad disciplines in the belief that they would be likely to exert the greatest practical impact on Israeli life in the near future.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s Cele Goldsmith {{took over}} as editor of both Fantastic and Amazing, and quickly invigorated the magazines, {{bringing}} in many new writers and making them, {{in the words of one}} science fiction historian, the [...] "best-looking and brightest" [...] magazines in the field. [...] She helped to <b>nurture</b> <b>the</b> early careers of writers such as Roger Zelazny and Ursula K. Le Guin, but was unable to increase circulation, and in 1965 the magazines were sold to Sol Cohen, who hired Joseph Wrzos as editor and switched to a reprint-only policy. [...] This was financially successful, but brought Cohen into conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America. [...] After a turbulent period at {{the end of the}} 1960s, Ted White became editor and the reprints were phased out.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Anna's biggest charm, Bell said that [...] "her charm is caught somewhere between her sincerity and optimism. Anna is genuine, sincere and {{compounded}} with optimism, and eternally optimistic {{people are the}} most charismatic people, much more attractive than those with a bad mood." [...] She also expressed why the character seemed to loveable to her, [...] "To have Anna {{in a situation where}} she starts the movie without any friends, because her lifestyle hasn’t allowed her to have a full kingdom. She runs around, because she wants friends." [...] Bell called the film's story is [...] "another turning point" [...] for Disney animation because the love depicted in this story is the love between siblings, a non-romantic love. Anna wants the world and she wants to explore, but she also wants to <b>nurture</b> <b>the</b> relationships around her, particularly the family relationship. [...] "It's very non-traditional for a Disney movie," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the Novi Sad-based {{publication}} Javor in 1890, {{the critic}} Milan Rešetar ranked the painting among Predić's finest works {{up to that}} point. The Croatian magazine Vienac offered a positive review of the work, saying it offered a sad look at conditions in the Banat. The magazine praised Predić as [...] "a true artist... one who isn't afraid to use his talent to educate people and <b>nurture</b> <b>the</b> nobler aspects of human nature". Critics were satisfied with Happy Brothers because it not only offered an instructive narrative but also demonstrated the artist's technical abilities. Such vignettes of village life contributed greatly to Predić's popularity among collectors from the emerging Serbian middle class. Reproductions of the painting met with commercial success, further contributing to its popularity. This led Predić to paint two replicas, one in 1918 {{and the other in}} 1922. By 1890, the original was owned by the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains.|$|E
