40|$|Under the strong-form {{of market}} discipline, {{publicly}} traded banks that have constantly available public market signals from their stock (and bond) prices would take less risk than <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> banks because counterparties, borrowers, and regulators could react to adverse public market signals against publicly traded banks. In comparing the credit risk, earnings risk, capitalization, and failure risk between publicly <b>traded</b> and <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> banks, {{the evidence in}} this paper rejects the strong-form of market discipline. In fact, the findings indicate that banking organizations tend to take more risk when they were publicly traded than when they were privately owned.

40|$|In 2007, the {{collapse}} of the housing market and the developing trend of state court filings of class actions alleging violations of the Securities Act culminated into a new type of securities litigation: state court filings of class actions alleging violations of the Securities Act with respect to <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> securities in general and mortgage-backed securities in particular. Thus, it became important for defendants to remove these claims to federal court. Permitting removal of such claims appears to conflict with the Securities Act, which broadly prohibits removal of claims arising under the Securities Act. But prohibiting removal is in tension with the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, which generally permits removal of class actions. This article considers whether the Securities Act bars removal of class actions alleging violations of the Securities Act with respect to <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> securities. Part I of this article provides a background on the issue and explains the general framework of removal and the conflicting provisions of the Securities Act and the Class Action Fairness Act. Next, Part II discusses the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s holding in Luther v. Countrywide that the Securities Act bars removal of a class action alleging violations of the Securities Act with respect to mortgage-backed securities. Part III analyzes the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Katz v. Gerardi, in which the court disagreed with Luther and held that the Securities Act does not bar removal of class actions that allege violations of the Securities Act with respect to <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> securities. Finally, Part IV analyzes and expands on the reasoning of the Luther and Katz courts, concluding that the Seventh Circuit decided correctly that the Securities Act does not bar removal of class actions alleging violations of the Securities Act with respect to <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> securities...|$|R

40|$|Valuation {{of small}} entrepreurial {{businesses}} requires identifying {{features that are}} not generally considered in the valuation model of large public firms. The challenge is to translate financial theory into a practical, available measure that can be employed {{as a proxy for}} valuation of small and entrepreneurial businesses, which are not publicly traded. This paper seeks to expand the list of valuation metrics for estimating the value of <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> firms by incorporating empirically determined explanatory factors to examine the relationship of performance measures and the value of the firm. A natural byproduct of the research effort will be the empirical examination and quantification of the factors that determine a private firm’s discount to publicly traded companies {{due to the lack of}} marketability and liquidity. A linear cross-sectional regression analysis was employed to extract idiosyncratic value factors for over 5, 000 companies included in the database. The results of this study provide strong support for future research to identify a broader range of explanatory financial variables to determine firm value for all <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> firms. Additionally, the results of this study can be used in price discovery by entrepreneurs, investors, advisors, litigation expert witnesses and business owners that are considering a business purchase or sale...|$|R

40|$|This {{study shows}} that {{financial}} market imperfections do matter for a firm’s access to external finance. Prior studies {{of the importance of}} liquidity constraints faced by nonfinancial firms have suffered from a glaring weakness. They have been based on a sample of publicly traded firms, omitting precisely those small firms most likely to be liquidity constrained. We overcome this limitation by focusing on the banking sector. Unlike the nonfinancial sector, the banking sector has balance sheet and income data available for all firms, {{whether or not they are}} publicly traded. This allows the use of a superior measure of the degree of information asymmetry across firms by distinguishing between publicly <b>traded</b> and <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> firms. Furthermore, we focus on changes in monetary policy that represent exogenous (to the banks) changes in the financing constraints faced by banks. We find that publicly traded banks, which exhibit a lower degree of information asymmetry, are better able to overcome financial market frictions, compared to the relatively opaque <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> banks, when monetary policy is tightened. Lending by the more transparent publicly traded banks is less affected by a monetary policy tightening in large part due to their ability to issue uninsured large time deposits. These results are obtained controlling for firm (bank) size, a dimension commonly used in the literature as the measure of the degree of firm access to external finance...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the proposal to}} modify regulations that determine a debt instrument’s issue price whenever there is an exchange of an instrument involving publicly traded property. Under both proposed and current regulation section 1. 1273 - 2, the issue price of an instrument received in an exchange involving public property {{is equal to the}} fair market value of the publicly traded property. In contrast, an instrument’s issue price in an exchange involving <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> property is equal to the principal amount or stated principal amount of the debt instrument received, amounts that are unlikely to equal or approximate fair market value. The proposed regulations continue this dichotomy. Existing regulations under 1001, not scheduled to be changed, provide that the amount realized on debt exchanges is determined by reference to the section 1273 issue price rules. By preventing the issue price of a debt instrument from being equal to fair market value of property in all cases, the plain language of section 1001 is violated, as is the fundamental principal of tax law that income be clearly reflected. This article urges the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service to modify the proposed regulations so as to allow taxpayers to elect the use of fair market value in determining the amount realized on the exchange debt instruments not involving <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> debt property...|$|R
50|$|Once {{money is}} inside an IRA, the IRA owner can direct the {{custodian}} {{to use the}} cash to purchase most types of publicly traded securities (traditional investments), and <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> securities (alternative investments). Specific assets such as collectibles (e.g., art, baseball cards, and rare coins) and life insurance cannot be held in an IRA. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) only outlines what is not allowed in an IRA. Some assets are allowed according to the IRC, but the custodians may add additional restrictions for accounts held in their custody. For example, the IRC allows an IRA to own a piece of rental property, but certain custodians may not allow this {{to be held in}} their custody.|$|R

This may be attributed to less information asymmetry between managers and owners at private banks. Also, directors are rewarded for strong CAMELS ratings.

Moreover, credit constraint and credit access variables appear to be among the most important factors predicting which small U.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} the Federal Reserve has an informational advantage over the public that can be exploited to improve activist monetary policy. The informational advantage derives from the Fed's role as a bank supervisor, and it is shown to be of sufficient duration {{to be effective in}} guiding activist monetary policy, even in simple rational expectations models. The informational superiority does not result from the Fed having earlier access to publicly released data about the financial condition of banks. Instead, this informational advantage is generated by confidential supervisory knowledge about troubled, <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> banks. As a result, this information can remain confidential {{for an extended period of}} time because these banks do not have an incentive to fully disclose publicly the extent of their financial troubles, and, since they are not publicly traded, are not required to do so. The improvement in forecasts using this confidential information is both statistically significant and economically important, providing a potential justification for activist monetary policy...|$|R

Additionally, the SEIU has attempted to criticize the treatment of taxation of carried interest.

We show that state ownership is positively associated with leverage and firms' access to long-term debt, while foreign ownership is negatively associated with all measures of leverage. Surprisingly, firms in better developed regions are associated with reduced access to long-term debt, suggesting the availability of alternative financing channels and the tightening of the lending standards under the on-going banking reform. The combination of ownership structures and institutions explains up to 6 % of the total variation in firms' leverage decisions, while firm characteristics alone explain no more than 8 % of the variation. Further, we show that non-state-owned firms tend to have lower total and short-term debt than their state-owned counterparts in less developed regions. Finally, we show that state-owned firms' easy access to long-term debt is positively associated with long-term investment and negatively associated with firm performance.

They are particularly important for small to medium sized companies whose internal resources are scarce. This article analyses the role of Private Equity Firms that constitute {{a major source of}} financing for <b>non-publicly</b> <b>traded</b> small to medium sized companies, in the formation of alliances for their portfolio companies. While previous studies analyse the question in the light of mainstream theories, we rely on the dual theory of the firm, combining the contractual/mainstream view and the knowledge-based view. Contrary to the current literature, our study does not rely on statistical tests but on a multiple and embedded case study with explanatory design to test hypotheses. The present study is therefore the first that enables testing the causal mechanisms at work beyond correlations. Results show that the roles that Private Equity Firms play can be intentional (detecting new growth opportunities, driven by the Private Equity Firm’s competences) as well as unintentional (reducingmarket inefficiencies through, mainly, informal mechanisms such as reputation and trust). Furthermore, our study highlights the benefits of the joint use of these theories and the complementary nature of both theories in explaining the phenomenon as a whole...|$|R
