40|$|Objectives: The aim was {{to verify}} the {{concordance}} of CT evaluation among four radiologists (two oral and maxillofacial and two medical radiologists) at the TN (tumour/node) stage and in the follow-up of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients. The study also compared differences between clinical and CT examinations in determining the TN stage. Methods: The following clinical and tomographic findings of 15 non-treated oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients were compared: tumour size, bone invasion and lymph node metastases. In another 15 patients, who had previously been treated, a clinical and tomographic analysis comparison {{for the presence of}} tumoural recurrence, post-therapeutic changes in muscles and lymph node metastases was performed. The concordances of tomographic evaluation between the radiologists were analysed using the kappa index. Results: Significant agreement was verified between all radiologists for the T stage, but not for the N stage. In the group of treated patients, CT disclosed post-therapeutic changes in muscles, tumour recurrence and lymph node metastases, but <b>no</b> <b>concordance</b> for the detection of lymph node metastases was found between radiologists. In the first group, for all radiologists, <b>no</b> <b>concordance</b> was demonstrated between clinical and tomographic staging. CT was effective for delimitating advanced lesions and for detecting lymph node involvement in N 0 stage patients. CT revealed two cases of bone invasion not clinically detected. Conclusions: Interprofessional relationships must be stimulated to improve diagnoses, and to promote a multidisciplinary approach to oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer. Although CT was important in the diagnosis and follow-up of cancer patients, differences between medical and dental analyses should be acknowledged.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{investigation}} examined {{human papillomavirus}} (HPV) in pregnant women {{in order to}} characterize viral prevalence, types and concordance between infection in the cervix and in the oral cavity. METHODS: A total of 577 pregnant women seeking routine obstetric care were evaluated for HPV infection in their cervix during gestation and immediately before delivery, and in the oral cavity during gestation. Male partners present during the gestational clinic visit also provided a specimen from their oral cavity. HPV assessment was performed by PCR, dot blot hybridization and DNA sequencing. A sexual and health questionnaire was completed by the pregnant women. RESULTS: HPV prevalence in women was 29 % in the cervix and 2. 4 % in the oral cavity. Among those with both gestational and delivery specimens, 35 % were infected at least once and 20 % had infection at both intervals. At delivery, 68 % of infected women had an oncogenic HPV type in the cervix. There was <b>no</b> type-specific HPV <b>concordance</b> between the two cervical specimens, nor cervical and oral results in women, nor with cervical and oral findings between partners.

Methods 　Twenty-five specimens of neuroblastoma were collected in our department during 2009. 1 – 2011. 6. G-CSF and G-CSFR were determined by immunohistochemistry. The correlation between expressions of G-CSF and G-CSFR and age, gender and clinical stage were analyzed. Results 　The expression of G-CSF and G-CSFR in neuroblastoma specimens was 68 %, 72 % respectively. Both G-CSF and G-CSFR were positive in 12 (48 %) specimens, and both G-CSF and G-CSFR were negative in 2 cases (8 %). But according to test of concordance, the positive expression of G-CSF and G-CSFR had <b>no</b> <b>concordance</b> in neuroblastoma specimens (Kappa=－ 0. 0456 ，P= 0. 8187).

40|$|Toxic Microcystis strains often produce several isoforms of the cyclic {{hepatotoxin}} microcystin, {{and more}} than 65 isoforms are known. This {{has been attributed to}} relaxed substrate specificity of the adenylation domain. Our results show that in addition to this, variability is also caused by genetic variation in the microcystin synthetase genes. Genetic characterization of a region of the adenylation domain in module mcyB 1 resulted in identification of two groups of genetic variants in closely related Microcystis strains. Sequence analyses suggested that the genetic variation is due to recombination events between mcyB 1 and the corresponding domains in mcyC. Each variant could be correlated to a particular microcystin isoform profile, as identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Among the Microcystis species studied, we found 11 strains containing different variants of the mcyABC gene cluster and 7 strains lacking the genes.

METHODS: Three groups of excisional biopsy specimens of conjunctival melanocytic proliferations were evaluated by 5 ophthalmic pathologists. These groups included lesions that were considered by the authors to represent benign (Group 1, n = 5), malignant (Group 2, n = 5) and indeterminate melanocytic proliferations (Group 3, n = 5). The panel classified the same sections in all 3 groups in a randomized, masked fashion, first without and then with a clinical history of patient age, sex and race. The kappa statistic (k) was used to quantify the degree of agreement among observers.

Eight invertebrate taxa from four different orders were included in this study of mainland New Zealand and Chatham Islands lineages to explore outcomes of island colonization. These comprised two orthopteran genera, one an endemic forest-dwelling genus of cave weta (Rhaphidophoridae, Talitropsis) and the other a grasshopper (Acrididae, Phaulacridum) that inhabits open grassland; four genera of Coleoptera including carabid beetles (Mecodema), stag beetles (Geodorcus), weevils (Hadramphus) and clickbeetles (Amychus); the widespread earwig genus Anisolabis (Dermaptera) that is common on beaches in New Zealand and the Chatham Islands, and an endemic and widespread cockroach genus Celatoblatta (Blattodea).

Results: For erythrocytes, leukocytes, epithelial cells, bacteria, crystals and yeasts, the degree of concordance between the two instruments was better than the degree of concordance between the manual microscopic method and the individual devices. There was <b>no</b> <b>concordance</b> between all methods for casts. Conclusion: The results from the automated analyzers for erythrocytes, leukocytes and epithelial cells were similar to the result of microscopic examination. However, in order to avoid any error or uncertainty, some images (particularly: dysmorphic cells, bacteria, yeasts, casts and crystals) have to be analyzed by manual microscopic examination by trained staff. Therefore, the software programs which are used in automatic urine sediment analysers need further development to recognize urinary shaped elements more accurately. Automated systems are important in terms of time saving and standardization. Keywords: Urinalysis, Autoanalysis, Microscop...|$|R
40|$|Nebulisers are a potential. {{source of}} bacterial. {{contamination}} in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The {{aims of the}} study were to survey patient practice regarding maintenance of home nebulisers and {{to assess the impact of}} standardised guidelines derived from a previous in-vitro study. In total, 42 CF patients were studied. During two consecutive home visits, a questionnaire regarding routine patient practice was completed by a nurse while sputum and equipment samples were taken for bacteriological analyses. The first visit took place at baseline, and the second followed the implementation of detailed instructions for cleaning and disinfecting the nebulisers using a 0. 5 % hypochlorite solution. The first visit identified a great diversity in routine patient practices. Commensal bacteria, environmental bacteria and potential. CF pathogens contaminated 78. 5 %, 57. 1 % and 14. 3 % of nebulisers respectively. After hypochlorite disinfection, rate and degree of global contamination decreased significantly, but the number of CF pathogens was not affected. There was <b>no</b> <b>concordance</b> between CF pathogens isolated from patients' sputum and their equipment. We conclude that in this sample of patients, initial routine practices were varied. With regard to CF pathogens, the superiority of a hypochlorite solution over a mix of other disinfection methods was not demonstrated. (C) 2009 The Hospital Infection Society.
