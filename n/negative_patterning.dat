40|$|Hippocampal {{function}} {{is important in}} the acquisition of <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> but not of simple discrimination. This study examined rat hippocampal theta activity during the acquisition stages (early, middle, and late) of the <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> task (A+, B+, AB-). The results showed that hippocampal theta activity began to decline transiently (for 500 ms after non-reinforced stimulus presentation) during the late stage of learning in the <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> task. In addition, this transient decline in hippocampal theta activity in the late stage was lower in the <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> task than in the simple discrimination task. This transient decline during the late stage of task acquisition may be related to a learning process distinctive of the <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> task but not the simple discrimination task. We propose that the transient decline of hippocampal theta activity reflects inhibitory learning and/or response inhibition after the presentation of a compound stimulus specific to the <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> task...|$|E
40|$|Though {{much work}} has studied how {{external}} factors, such as stimulus properties, influence generalization of associative strength, {{there has been}} limited exploration of the influence that internal dispositions may contribute to stimulus processing. Here we report 2 studies using a modified <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> discrimination to test the relationship between global processing and generalization. Global processing was associated with stronger <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> discrimination, indicative of limited generalization between distinct stimulus compounds and their constituent elements. In Experiment 2, participants pretrained to adopt global processing similarly showed strong <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> discrimination. These results demonstrate considerable individual difference in capacity to engage in <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> discrimination and suggest that the tendency toward global processing may be one factor explaining this variability.

40|$|Animal-based {{theories}} of Pavlovian conditioning propose that patterning discriminations are solved using unique cues or immediate configuring. Recent studies with humans, however, provided evidence that in positive and <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> two different rules are utilized. The present experiment {{was designed to}} provide further support for this proposal by tracking {{the time course of}} the allocation of cognitive resources. One group was trained in a positive patterning; schedule (A-, B-, AB+) and a second in a <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> schedule (A+, B+, AB-). Electrodermal responses and secondary task probe reaction time were measured. In <b>negative</b> <b>patterning,</b> reaction times were slower during reinforced stimuli than during non-reinforced stimuli at both probe positions while there were no differences in positive patterning. These results support the assumption that <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> is solved using a rule that is more complex and requires more resources than does the rule employed to solve positive patterning.

By using descriptive method of research, the writer collects all negative utterances produced by the four major black characters - Walter, Mama, Ruth and Beneatha as the source of data. In classifying and analyzing the data, the writer uses relevant underlying theories they are Baker's and Francis's theories of negative sentence and Labov's theory of Black English <b>negative</b> <b>patterns.</b> The data is classified and analyzed to find the <b>negative</b> syntactic <b>patterns</b> used by the four major black characters in this play.

40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the hippocampal for-mation {{is necessary for the}} acquisition of tasks that re-quire the use of configural representations for their solu-tion, including spatial learning and <b>negative</b> <b>patterning.</b> Tests of this influential view have, however, yielded con-flicting results. For example fornix or hippocampal le-sions, which reliably impair spatial learning, do not reli-ably impair <b>negative</b> <b>patterning.</b> A problem in interpret-ing these results has been the lack of controls for factors such as over-responding, excitatory effects of reward, and the possibility of non-configural solutions. At the same time, other studies have pointed to a role in config-ural learning for parahippocampal regions such as the perirhinal cortex. The present experiments controlled for the above factors and revealed that neither lesions of the fornix nor of the perirhinal/postrhinal cortex in the rat had any effect on <b>negative</b> <b>patterning,</b> although subse-quent tests of object and spatial memory demonstrated the functional efficacy of the lesions...|$|E

40|$|Repeated {{exposure}} of rats to withdrawal from chronic ethanol reduces hippocampal long-term potentiation and {{gives rise to}} epileptiform-like activity in hippocampus. We investigated whether such withdrawal experience also affects learning in tasks thought {{to be sensitive to}} hippocampal damage. Rats fed an ethanol-containing diet for 24 days with two intermediate 3 -day withdrawal episodes, resulting in intakes of 13 - 14 g/kg ethanol per day, showed impaired <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> discrimination compared with controls and animals that had continuous 24 -day ethanol treatment, but did not differ from these animals in the degree of contextual freezing 24 h after training or in spatial learning in the Barnes maze. Repeatedly withdrawn animals also showed increased numbers of responses in the period immediately before reinforcement became available in an operant task employing a fixed-interval schedule although overall temporal organization of responding was unimpaired. Thus, in our model of repeated withdrawal from ethanol, previously observed changes in hippocampal function did not manifest at the behavioural level in the tests employed. The deficit seen after repeated withdrawal in the <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> discrimination and over-responding in the fixed-interval paradigm might be related to the changes in the functioning of the cortex after withdrawal...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Negative</b> {{sequential}} <b>pattern</b> mining {{has attracted}} increasing concerns in recent data mining research because it considers negative relationships between itemsets, which are ignored by positive sequential pattern mining. However, the search space for mining <b>negative</b> <b>patterns</b> is {{much bigger than}} that for positive ones. When the support threshold is low, in particular, there will be huge amounts of negative candidates. This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based al-gorithm to find <b>negative</b> sequential <b>patterns</b> with novel crossover and mutation operations, which are efficient at passing good genes on to next generations with-out generating candidates. An effective dynamic fitness function and a pruning method are also provided to improve performance. The results of extensive ex-periments show that the proposed method can find <b>negative</b> <b>patterns</b> efficiently and has remarkable performance compared with some other algorithms of nega-tive pattern mining...|$|R

We have developed a similarly responding, RPE-based model of the striatum by incorporating lateral inhibition. Model neurons are assigned to either the direct or the indirect pathway but lateral connections occur within and between these groups, leading to competition between both the individual neurons and their pathways.

In this study, the mixing efficiencies from negative and positive staggered herringbone mixer patterns as well as from opposite flow directions were tested to investigate the effect of the micro-structure geometry on the surrounding laminar flow.

40|$|Identifying {{statistical}} patterns {{between environmental}} stimuli enables organisms to respond adaptively when cues are later observed. However, stimuli are often obscured from detection, necessitating behavior {{under conditions of}} ambiguity. Considerable evidence indicates decisions under ambiguity rely on inference processes that draw on past experiences to generate predictions under novel conditions. Despite the high demand for this process and the observation that it deteriorates disproportionately with age, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We developed a rodent model of decision-making during ambiguity to examine features of experience that contribute to inference. Rats learned either a simple (positive patterning) or complex (<b>negative</b> <b>patterning)</b> instrumental discrimination between the illumination {{of one or two}} lights. During test, only one light was lit while the other relevant light was blocked from physical detection (covered by an opaque shield, rendering its status ambiguous). We found experience with the complex <b>negative</b> <b>patterning</b> discrimination was necessary for rats to behave sensitively to the ambiguous test situation. These rats behaved as if they inferred the presence of the hidden light, responding differently than when the light was explicitly absent (uncovered and unlit). Differential expression profiles of the immediate early gene cFos indicated hippocampal involvement in the inference process while localized microinfusions of the muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine, into the dorsal hippocampus caused rats to behave as if only one light was present. That is, blocking cholinergic modulation prevented the rat from inferring the presence of the hidden light. Collectively, these results suggest cholinergic modulation mediates recruitment of hippocampal processes related to past experiences and transfer of these processes to make decisions during ambiguous situations. Our results correspond with correlations observed between human brain function and inference abilities, suggesting our experiments may inform interventions to alleviate or prevent cognitive dysfunction. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
