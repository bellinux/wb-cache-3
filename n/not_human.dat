5|$|As the Doctor and {{geologist}} Nasreen Chaudhry arrive by TARDIS in {{the massive}} Silurian underground civilisation, they are captured and taken to the Silurian doctor, Malohkeh. The Silurians' hostility is increased when the Doctor recalls his previous meeting with a similar race of reptilian humanoids which were destroyed by humans, {{a reference to the}} Third Doctor in Doctor Who and the Silurians. Meanwhile, Amy and Mo escape from Malokeh's experimentation and Mo discovers his son, Elliot, sedated in a chamber and under observation. When Malokeh realises the Doctor is <b>not</b> <b>human,</b> the leader of the Silurian warrior caste, Restac, insists both the Doctor and Nasreen be executed and escorts them to a Silurian court; though Amy and Mo interrupt the trial with stolen weapons, they too are captured. Eldane, Restac's superior, is called in by Malohkeh and demands a halt to the hostilities.|$|E
5|$|On Spectrum's {{airborne}} headquarters, Cloudbase, Spectrum commander-in-chief Colonel White {{concludes that}} Brown was a traitor and was concealing a bomb on his person. Unaware of the Mysterons' subversion of his officers, he orders Scarlet's reconstruction {{to fly the}} President to a second Maximum Security Building in London. When {{the body of the}} original Brown is discovered {{at the scene of the}} SPC crash, it dawns on White that the President is in the hands of an impostor, and that the person whom he believed to be Scarlet is <b>not</b> <b>human.</b> Ignoring instructions to return to Cloudbase, with his Spectrum Jet under fire from the Angel fighter squadron, the Scarlet duplicate ejects himself and the President over southern England; on the ground, both the duplicate and the President, the latter being held hostage, set off towards London in a stolen car.|$|E
5|$|Both the Human {{fleet and}} the rebel Cylons are disillusioned after finding Earth devastated by a nuclear holocaust, which {{occurred}} at least 2,000 {{years prior to}} the events of the episode. After research on the bodies found in the soil, the Cylons and Dr. Baltar (James Callis) conclude the remains are <b>not</b> <b>Human,</b> but Cylon in origin. The rebel Cylons further state the mechanical Cylon remains resemble older Centurions of theirs, but are of a kind unknown to them. Following this, they postulate that the Thirteenth Tribe consisted of a different kind of Cylon which existed over 2,000 years ago and moved out from Kobol to populate Earth. When addressing the fleet, Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) never states this fact, leaving the fleet in the belief that the Thirteenth Tribe was human. Meanwhile, Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) and Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma) receive memories showing that they had lived and died on Earth 2,000 years ago. Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) has Leoben (Callum Keith Rennie) help track the origins of the beacon. However, what they find is a crashed Colonial Viper, containing a corpse with Starbuck's dog tags. After Kara recites what the Hybrid has told her, Leoben becomes scared and retreats, with Thrace wondering what she is. In shock, Thrace takes the body and burns it on a pyre, and decides to not tell anyone about what she found, making people believe she lost the signal.|$|E

5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is <b>not</b> <b>human.</b> The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all she has to do is squeeze.|$|E

As in prokaryotes, genes in chloroplast DNA are organized into operons. Interestingly though, unlike prokaryotic DNA molecules, chloroplast DNA molecules contain introns (plant mitochondrial DNAs do too, but <b>not</b> <b>human</b> mtDNAs).|$|E
25|$|The actual {{cause of}} the foam loss on both Columbia and Discovery was not {{determined}} until December 2005, when x-ray photographs of another tank showed that {{thermal expansion and contraction}} during filling, <b>not</b> <b>human</b> error, caused cracks that led to foam loss. NASA's Hale formally apologized to the Michoud workers who had been blamed for the loss of Columbia for almost three years.|$|E

25|$|Another way {{of viewing}} {{the problem is}} to {{consider}} the effects of human-induced climate change on the probability of future extreme weather events. Stott et al. (2003), for example, considered whether or <b>not</b> <b>human</b> activities had increased the risk of severe heat waves in Europe, like the one experienced in 2003. Their conclusion was that human activities had very likely more than doubled the risk of heat waves of this magnitude.|$|E

Mea is voiced by Asumi Noda in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Mai Kadowaki and in English by Anna Cummer.|$|E

It is the third and final film in a series based on the <b>Not</b> Quite <b>Human</b> novels by Seth McEvoy. The story, which has a darker tone than the previous films, features the human-looking android, Chip, embarking on a mission to rescue his father, who has been kidnapped by a ruthless tycoon in order to acquire his knowledge of android technology. Robyn Lively does not return to reprise her role as Becky, but she is mentioned to have taken a job in another state.|$|R
25|$|Lee Campbell {{was one of}} the {{casualties}} on Flight 811, a native New Zealander returning home. After his death, his parents Kevin and Susan Campbell investigated the cause of the decompression independently of the NTSB. The Campbells' investigation led them to conclude that the cause of the incident was <b>not</b> <b>human</b> error but instead the combination of an electrical problem and an inadequate design of the aircraft's cargo door latching mechanism. They later presented their findings to the safety board.|$|E
25|$|Open {{clusters}} are {{groups of}} stars that are physically related — gravitationally bound together and {{moving through the}} galaxy {{in the same direction}} and speed. As these groupings are <b>not</b> <b>human</b> constructs, but real phenomena, they do not count as asterisms. Among the best-known and closest are the Pleiades (M45) and the Hyades in Taurus and the Beehive (M44) in Cancer. (It may be noted that, with the addition of Aldebaran, which is in the same line of sight, the Hyades open cluster forms a V-shaped sectional asterism in Taurus).|$|E
25|$|Reeves and Nass {{established}} two rules {{before the}} test- when a computer asks a user about itself, the user will give more positive responses than when a different computer asks the same questions. They expected {{people to be}} less variable with their responses when they took a test and then answered a questionnaire on the same computer. They wanted to see that computers, although <b>not</b> <b>human,</b> can implement social responses. The independent variable was the computer (there are 2 in the test), and the dependent variable was the evaluation responses. The control was a pen-and-paper questionnaire.|$|E

25|$|Palast {{has also}} taken {{issue with the}} {{official}} story behind the grounding of the Exxon Valdez, claiming the sobriety of the Valdezs captain {{was not an issue}} in the accident. According to Palast, the main cause of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 was <b>not</b> <b>human</b> error, but an Exxon decision not to use the ship's radar in order to save money. The Raytheon Raycas radar system would not have detected Bligh Reef itself - as radar, unlike sonar, is incapable of detecting submerged objects. The radar system would have detected the radar reflector, placed on the next rock inland from Bligh Reef for the purpose of keeping vessels on course via radar.|$|E
25|$|Larval {{invasion}} of the skin (mostly in the Americas) can produce a skin disease called cutaneous larva migrans also known as creeping eruption. The hosts of these worms are <b>not</b> <b>human</b> and the larvae can only penetrate the upper five layers of the skin, where they give rise to intense, local itching, usually on the foot or lower leg, known as ground itch. This infection is due to larvae from the A. Braziliense hookworm. The larvae migrate in tortuous tunnels between the stratum basale and stratum corneum of the skin, causing serpiginous vesicular lesions. With advancing movement of the larvae, the rear portions of the lesions become dry and crusty. The lesions are typically intensely itchy.|$|E
25|$|Domestication {{should not}} be {{confused}} with taming. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of a wild-born animal when its natural avoidance of humans is reduced and it accepts the presence of humans, but domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition toward humans. Human selection included tameness, but without a suitable evolutionary response then domestication was not achieved. Domestic animals need not be tame in the behavioral sense, such as the Spanish fighting bull. Wild animals can be tame, such as a hand-raised cheetah. A domestic animal's breeding is controlled by humans and its tameness and tolerance of humans is genetically determined. However, an animal merely bred in captivity is not necessarily domesticated. Tigers, gorillas, and polar bears breed readily in captivity but are not domesticated. Asian elephants are wild animals that with taming manifest outward signs of domestication, yet their breeding is <b>not</b> <b>human</b> controlled and thus they are not true domesticates.|$|E

25|$|Letts had {{intended}} to cast an older actor as the Fourth Doctor, to hark back to Hartnell's portrayal in the 1960s, but after a long search he eventually selected Tom Baker, who was suggested {{to him by the}} incoming Head of Serials, Bill Slater. Baker was only forty years old, almost fifteen years Pertwee's junior, but despite not being the type of actor Letts had originally been looking for, he went on to become arguably the most popular and best-remembered to play the role. He starred in the series for seven years, longer than any of his predecessors or successors, and during his time on the programme Doctor Who enjoyed a consistent run of popular success and high viewing figures. Baker's Doctor was a more eccentric personality, at times passionate and caring, but at other times aloof and alien. This ambivalence was a deliberate choice by Baker, in an attempt to remind the viewers that the Doctor was <b>not</b> <b>human,</b> and therefore had non-human characteristics.|$|E
25|$|There was {{reluctant}} {{support for the}} Convention back in the UK where Attlee's Labour government were in power. The Lord Chancellor Jowitt, the Colonial Secretary Griffiths and the Chancellor Sir Stafford Cripps disapproved of ratification {{on the basis of}} the loss of sovereignty that would result. Jowitt also saw a threat to the domestic system of common law and the risk in allowing judgments to be made by an unknown foreign court. He nevertheless believed that ratification was necessary from a political point of view as a refusal would be, in his view, difficult to justify at home and abroad. Political pressure aside, the overall government view was that the Convention was only aimed at preventing a totalitarian takeover and <b>not</b> <b>human</b> rights issues within a functioning democracy. In essence, it was thought that Britain had little to lose from ratification but rejection could risk some loss of face in Europe. The Convention had more support among Conservative party politicians, in particular Winston Churchill who believed that it could help unify Europe {{on the basis of the}} rule of law.|$|E
25|$|Kyo is {{the heir}} to the Tengu Clan. It is {{revealed}} that Kyo is <b>not</b> <b>human</b> but a powerful demon. When he is in his demon form, his hair grown longer, has black wings, and wears a mask that looks like a crow's beak. Perverted and cocky to many, but he treats Misao with a combination of kindness and coldness depending on his mood. Kyo met Misao during their childhood; they quickly developed a strong bond and {{he fell in love with}} her. They also made a promise that she would be his bride, which he is determined to fulfill. His older brother, Sho, was supposed to be clan leader, but Kyo surpassed him for Misao's sake (as only a clan leader may seek her as their bride). In order to stay close to Misao, he moved back to his house next door to hers and took a job as a math teacher at her school. He is always protecting her and healing her wounds, also finding moments to steal a kiss. While he cares deeply for Misao, Kyo has deep attachments to those close to him: such that he took Taro under his wings to train him and make him stronger after Taro was abused by Shou. Kyo has deep disdain towards his brother (for his abusive ways) and his father (whom he suspected of murdering his mother). After Sho's death, Kyo learns that Misao is pregnant with his child, a powerful demon child. He is initially happy of the news, but when he learns that the children of the Immortal Fruit will feed on their mothers after childbirth, he wants her to abort the pregnancy but she refuses. When Misao tells him that she loves the baby and it loves her, he comes to care for the baby. Misao gives birth to a boy, whom they name Sou. Misao, by miracle, survives and Kyo is able to live happily with her and Sou.|$|E
