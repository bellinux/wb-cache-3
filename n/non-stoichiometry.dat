25|$|Although YBa2Cu3O7 is a {{well-defined}} chemical compound {{with a specific}} structure and stoichiometry, materials with fewer than seven oxygen atoms per formula unit are non-stoichiometric compounds. The structure of these materials depends on the oxygen content. This <b>non-stoichiometry</b> is denoted by the x in the chemical formula YBa2Cu3O7−x. When x = 1, the O(1) sites in the Cu(1) layer are vacant and the structure is tetragonal. The tetragonal form of YBCO is insulating and does not superconduct. Increasing the oxygen content slightly causes more of the O(1) sites to become occupied. For x < 0.65, Cu-O chains along the b axis of the crystal are formed. Elongation of the b axis changes the structure to orthorhombic, with lattice parameters of a = 3.82, b = 3.89, and c = 11.68 Å.

The device is composed of a thin film of Ag$_{ 2 }$S (solid electrolyte) contacted by a Pt nano-contact acting as ion-blocking electrode, and a large area Ag reference electrode. When applying a bias voltage both ionic and electronic transport occurs, and depending on the polarity it causes an accumulation of ions around the nano-contact. At small applied voltages (pre-switching) we observed this as a strongly nonlinear current-voltage curve, which have been modeled using the Hebb-Wagner treatment for polarization of a mixed conductor.

These modes are assigned to Bg, Bg, Ag, Bg, Bg,Ag, Ag, Ag, and Bg, respectively. However, at higher wavenumbers, the agreement is less evident. The experimental peaks located at 524 and 601  cm− 1, which are both assigned to Ag modes, are still quite well reproduced by the computed values within 5  cm− 1, whereas for the peaks at 749, 869, and 900  cm− 1, which are assigned to the Bg, Bg, and Ag modes, respectively, there is a larger variation {{in the range of}} 10  cm− 1. This behavior at higher wavenumbers was expected according to several reports in which the low energy part of the experimental spectrum was always better matched by theory than the higher energy part [71, 72].

These peaks were broadened and enhanced in resonance conditions using λ ex =  532  nm (2.33  eV) and λ ex =  473  nm (2.62  eV), and likely due to LO overtones, were too weak to be observed in non-resonance conditions.
