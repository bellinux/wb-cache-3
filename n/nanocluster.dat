5000|$|... === Optical {{properties}} === The {{optical properties}} of materials are determined by their electronic structure and band gap. The energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO) varies with the size and composition of a <b>nanocluster.</b> Thus, the optical properties of nanoclusters change. Furthermore, the gaps can be modified by coating the nanoclusters with different ligands or surfactants. It is also possible to design nanoclusters with tailored band gaps and thus tailor optical properties by simply tuning the size and coating layer of the <b>nanocluster.</b>|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{developed}} SPIO <b>nanoclusters</b> consisting of iron oxide core wrapped within Alkyl-PEI. The Alkyl-PEI-SPIO <b>nanoclusters</b> are very stable without any aggregation {{for more than}} 12  months as the surface charge of SPIO <b>nanoclusters</b> is higher than 30  mV. Furthermore, the SPIO <b>nanoclusters</b> can be successful internalized in different types of cells. Significantly, SPIO <b>nanoclusters</b> show good performance as a contrast agent for cellular MRI. These data indicate that the SPIO <b>nanoclusters</b> have potential application in cell labeling and tracking. With careful attention on biosafety of the SPIO <b>nanoclusters,</b> the biocompatibility of the SPIO <b>nanoclusters</b> was studied using MTS, LDH, FCS, and western blotting assays, {{and there is no}} significant cytotoxicity in fibroblast cell lines, macrophage cell lines, or hepatic endothelial cell lines. We further observed that ferritin might protect cells from overload iron that leaks from SPIO <b>nanoclusters.</b> Therefore, our study provides a potential magnetic <b>nanoclusters</b> system with good biocompatibility for the universal cell labeling and MRI tracking.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} atomic <b>nanoclusters</b> dates to prehistoric times.

40|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} {{have shown}} great prospective in cancer diagnosis and therapy, {{but they can}} not be metabolized and prefer to accumulate in liver and spleen due to their large size. The gold <b>nanoclusters</b> with small size can penetrate kidney tissue and have promise to decrease in vivo toxicity by renal clearance. In this work, we explore the in vivo renal clearance, biodistribution, and toxicity responses of the BSA- and GSH-protected gold <b>nanoclusters</b> for 24 hours and 28 days. The BSA-protected gold <b>nanoclusters</b> have low-efficient renal clearance and only 1 % of gold can be cleared, but the GSH-protected gold <b>nanoclusters</b> have high-efficient renal clearance and 36 % of gold can be cleared after 24 hours. The biodistribution further reveals that 94 % of gold can be metabolized for the GSH-protected <b>nanoclusters,</b> but only less than 5 % of gold can be metabolized for the BSA-protected <b>nanoclusters</b> after 28 days. Both of the GSH- and BSA-protected gold <b>nanoclusters</b> cause acute infection, inflammation, and kidney function damage after 24 hours, but these toxicity responses for the GSH-protected gold <b>nanoclusters</b> can be eliminated after 28 days. Immune system can also be affected by the two kinds of gold <b>nanoclusters,</b> but the immune response for the GSH-protected gold <b>nanoclusters</b> can also be recovered after 28 days. These findings show that the GSH-protected gold <b>nanoclusters</b> have small size and can be metabolized by renal clearance and thus the toxicity can be significantly decreased. The BSA- protected gold <b>nanoclusters,</b> however, can form large compounds and further accumulate in liver and spleen which can cause irreparable toxicity response. Therefore, the GSH-protected gold <b>nanoclusters</b> have great potential for in vivo imaging and therapy, and the BSA-protected gold <b>nanoclusters</b> can be used as the agent of liver cancer therapy.

5000|$|Molecular beams {{can be used}} {{to create}} <b>nanocluster</b> beams of {{virtually}} any element. They can be synthesized in high vacuum by with molecular beam techniques combined with a mass spectrometer for mass selection, separation and analysis. And finally detected with detectors.|$|E
50|$|Clusters {{are often}} {{regarded}} as zero-dimensional units and most atoms in a <b>nanocluster</b> are surface atoms. Thus, {{it is expected}} that the magnetic moment of an atom in a cluster will be larger than that of one in a bulk material. Lower coordination, lower dimensionality, and increasing interatomic distance in metal clusters contribute to enhancement of the magnetic moment in nanoclusters. Metal nanoclusters also show change in magnetic properties. For example, vanadium and rhodium are paramagnetic in bulk but become ferromagnetic in nanoclusters. Also, manganese is antiferromagnetic in bulk but ferromagnetic in nanoclusters. A small <b>nanocluster</b> is a nanomagnet, which can be made nonmagnetic simply by changing its structure. So they can form the basis of a nanomagnetic switch.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the application of}} the techniques of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze and characterize various types of inorganic <b>nanoclusters.</b> Both metal and semiconductor <b>nanoclusters</b> were grown in inverse micelles and we demonstrate how the <b>nanoclusters</b> can be separated from the surfactants and other byproducts of the reaction by using a variety of HPLC columns. We also discuss passivation of the cluster surface to prevent aggregation. The HPLC columns separate the clusters based upon a combination of size exclusion and chemical affinity mechanisms and the optical properties of the purified clusters are determined on- line using a variety of detectors. These include a photodiode array for collecting absorbance spectra, a fluorescence detector to monitor luminescence, and a conductivity detector to monitor surface charge on the <b>nanoclusters.</b> We illustrate the analysis of <b>nanoclusters</b> using HPLC by showing data from semiconductor Si, MoS{sub 2 } <b>nanoclusters</b> and Au <b>nanoclusters.</b> An extremely novel luminescence was observed from very small metal <b>nanoclusters...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In general, metal <b>nanoclusters</b> {{in an aqueous}} medium are {{synthesized}} in two steps: {{reduction of}} metal ions to zero-valent state and stabilization of <b>nanoclusters.</b> Without stabilization, metal <b>nanoclusters</b> would strongly {{interact with each other}} and aggregate irreversibly to form larger particles.|$|R
30|$|Recently, major {{advances}} in wet chemical synthesis of <b>nanoclusters</b> have been achieved, {{and it has}} been possible to control <b>nanoclusters</b> at the atomic level. A number of well-defined <b>nanoclusters</b> have been reported; however, only a few can be obtained in bulk quantities and in high yields via facile synthetic methods [34]. Among the various thiolate-protected gold <b>nanoclusters,</b> Au 25 (SR) 18 has been extensively studied [21 – 27, 35 – 41]. Other well-defined <b>nanoclusters</b> have also been attained, such as Au 36 [42], Au 38 [43, 44], Au 102 [45], and Au 144 [46, 47].|$|R
50|$|The source enters these {{nanoclusters}} {{and begins}} to saturate them. On reaching supersaturation, the source solidifies and grows outward from the <b>nanocluster.</b> Simply turning off the source can adjust the final length of the nanowire. Switching sources while still in the growth phase can create compound nanowires with super-lattices of alternating materials.|$|E
50|$|Not all the {{clusters}} are stable. The stability of nanoclusters {{depends on the}} number of atoms in the <b>nanocluster,</b> valence electron counts and encapsulating scaffolds. In the 1990s, Heer and his coworkers used supersonic expansion of an atomic cluster source into a vacuum in the presence of an inert gas and produced atomic cluster beams. Heer's team and Brack et al. discovered that certain masses of formed metal nanoclusters were stable and were like magic clusters. The number of atoms or size of the core of these magic clusters corresponds to the closing of atomic shells. Certain thiolated clusters such as Au25(SR)18, Au38(SR)24, Au102(SR)44 and Au144(SR)60 also showed magic number stability. Häkkinen et al explained this stability with a theory that a <b>nanocluster</b> is stable if the number of valence electrons corresponds to the shell closure of atomic orbitals as (1S2, 1P6, 1D10, 2S2 1F14, 2P6 1G18, 2D10 3S2 1H22.......).|$|E
50|$|Gold {{clusters}} in cluster chemistry are gold-derived {{materials that}} {{can either be}} discrete molecules or larger colloidal particles. Both types are described as nanoparticles, with diameters of less than one micrometer.

40|$|The {{effect of}} heat {{treatment}} {{on the structure}} and luminescence of Ag <b>nanoclusters</b> doped oxyfluoride glasses was studied and the implication for drawing the corresponding fibers doped with luminescent Ag <b>nanoclusters</b> has been proposed. The heat treatment results, first, in condensation of the Ag <b>nanoclusters</b> into larger Ag nanoparticles and loss of Ag luminescence, and further heat treatment results in precipitation of a luminescent-loss nano- and microcrystalline Ag phases {{onto the surface of}} the glass. Thus, the oxyfluoride fiber doped with luminescent Ag <b>nanoclusters</b> was pulled from the viscous glass melt and its attenuation loss was 0. 19 dB/cm in the red part of the spectrum; i. e. near to the maximum of Ag <b>nanoclusters</b> luminescence band.

50|$|Nanoclusters {{are smaller}} {{nanoparticles}} whose properties {{resemble those of}} molecules and thus are said {{to bridge the gap}} between the nanoparticle and the atom. They possess unique properties, completely different from their bulk counterparts. Strong florescence, reactivity and the magnetic property of nanoclusters have attracted many researchers to exploit their properties for useful applications. Likewise, many synthesis process and stabilizing scaffolds have been formulated to harvest the size-dependent properties of the <b>nanocluster.</b> To enhance a given property of nanoclusters, a proper synthesis route and proper scaffold to stabilize them must be chosen.|$|E
50|$|Cryogenic gas {{molecules}} {{are used}} as scaffolds for <b>nanocluster</b> synthesis in solid state. In aqueous medium there are two common methods for stabilizing nanoclusters: electrostatic (charge, or inorganic) stabilization and steric (organic) stabilization. Electrostatic stabilization occurs by the adsorption of ions to the often-electrophilic metal surface, which creates an electrical double layer. Thus, this Coulomb repulsion force between individual particles will {{not allow them to}} flow freely without agglomeration. Whereas on the other hand in steric stabilization,the metal center is surrounded by layers of sterically bulk material. These large adsorbates provide a steric barrier which prevents close contact of the metal particle centers.|$|E
50|$|Polymers.

The linear polyacrylates, poly(methacrylic acid), act as an excellent scaffold for the preparation of silver <b>nanoclusters</b> in water solution by photoreduction. Poly(methacrylic acid)-stabilized <b>nanoclusters</b> have an excellent high quantum yield and can be transferred to other scaffolds or solvents and can sense the local environment.|$|R

Also many small molecules, biological entities such as biomolecules, proteins, DNA, and RNA can be detected using <b>nanoclusters.</b> The unique reactivity properties and the ability to control the size and number of atoms in <b>nanoclusters</b> have proven to be a valuable method for increasing activity and tuning the selectivity in a catalytic process.

50|$|Large surface-to-volume {{ratios and}} low {{coordination}} of surface atoms are primary {{reasons for the}} unique reactivity of nanoclusters. Thus, nanoclusters are widely used as catalysts. Gold <b>nanocluster</b> {{is an excellent example}} of a catalyst. While bulk gold is chemically inert, it becomes highly reactive when scaled down to nanometer scale. One of the properties that govern cluster reactivity is electron affinity. Chlorine has highest electron affinity of any material in the periodic table. Clusters can have high electron affinity and nanoclusters with high electron affinity are classified as super halogens. Super halogens are metal atoms at the core surrounded by halogen atoms.|$|E

These devices exhibit a clear visible transparency {{similar to that}} of glass and a power conversion efficiency close to 0.5%. In this configuration efficiencies of over 10% are possible due to the large fraction of photon flux in the near-infrared spectrum.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} decade an {{increasing}} number of plasma membrane (PM) proteins {{have been shown to be}} non-randomly distributed but instead forming submicron-sized oligomers called <b>nanoclusters.</b> <b>Nanoclusters</b> exist independently of the ligand-bound state of the receptors and their existence implies a high degree of lateral organisation of the PM and its proteins. The mechanisms that drive receptor <b>nanoclustering</b> are largely unknown. One well-defined example of a transmembrane receptor that forms <b>nanoclusters</b> is the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), a multisubunit protein complex whose <b>nanoclustering</b> influences its activity. Membrane lipids, namely cholesterol and sphingomyelin, have been shown to contribute to TCR <b>nanoclustering.</b> However, the identity of the membrane microdomain in which the TCR resides remains controversial. Using a GFP-labeled TCR we show here that the resting TCR localized in the disordered domain of giant PM vesicles (GPMVs) and PM spheres (PMSs) and that single and <b>nanoclustered</b> TCRs are found in the high-density fractions in sucrose gradients.

50|$|Thiols. Thiol-containing small {{molecules}} {{are the most}} commonly adopted stabilizers in metal nanoparticle synthesis owing to {{the strong interaction between}} thiols and gold and silver. Glutathione {{has been shown to be}} an excellent stabilizer for synthesizing gold nanoclusters with visible luminescence by reducing Au3+ in the presence of glutathione with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Also other thiols such as tiopronin, phenylethylthiolate, thiolate α-cyclodextrin and 3-mercaptopropionic acid and bidentate dihydrolipoic acid are other thiolated compounds currently being used in the synthesis of metal nanoclusters. The size as well as the luminescence efficiency of the <b>nanocluster</b> depends sensitively on the thiol-to-metal molar ratio. The higher the ratio, the smaller the nanoclusters. The thiol-stabilized nanoclusters can be produced using strong as well as mild reductants. Thioled metal nanoclusters are mostly produced using the strong reductant sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Gold <b>nanocluster</b> synthesis can also be achieved using a mild reducant tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium (THPC). Here a zwitterionic thiolate ligand, D-penicillamine (DPA), is used as the stabilizer. Furthermore, nanoclusters can be produced by etching larger nanoparticles with thiols. Thiols can be used to etch larger nanoparticles stabilized by other capping agents. Dendrimers. Dendrimers are used as templates to synthesize nanoclusters. Gold nanoclusters embedded in poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (PAMAM) have been successfully synthesized. PAMAM is repeatedly branched molecules with different generations. The florescence properties of the nanoclusters are sensitively dependent on the types of dendrimers used as template for the synthesis. Metal nanoclusters embedded in different templates show maximum emission at different wavelengths. The change in florescence property is mainly due to surface modification by the capping agents. Although gold nanoclusters embedded in PAMAM are blue-emitting the spectrum can be tuned from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared (NIR) region and the relative PAMAM/gold concentration and the dendrimer generation can be varied. The green-emitting gold nanoclusters can be synthesized by adding mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) into the prepared small gold nanoparticle solution. The addition of freshly reduced lipoic acid (DHLA) gold nanoclusters (AuNC@DHLA) become red-emitting fluorophores.|$|E
