Geoffrey then went to York, but until his election was ratified by the pope he refused to allow Burchard to take up his office. This stance was supported {{by most of the}} York cathedral chapter. Geoffrey then was sent by Richard to escort William the Lion from Scotland to Canterbury. It was at Canterbury that papal assent to Geoffrey's election was secured in December, when Giovanni d'Anagni, the papal legate, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>confirmed</b> the election, but rejected the various appeals made by the cathedral chapter against Geoffrey. But the king forced Geoffrey to allow the royal appointments, and pay a fine of £2000 before his lands were restored, although Geoffrey was allowed some time to make the full payment.|$|E

Arnolds <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>confirmed</b> the {{association of}} waxcaps with unimproved grasslands, but also noted the rapid decline in such habitats in the Netherlands.

25|$|During {{the famous}} meeting of Garibaldi with King Victor Emmanuel II at Teano, the king refused Garibaldi's {{request that the}} {{soldiers}} and officers {{who took part in}} the Expedition of the Thousand be taken into the Italian Army, and most of them were in fact dismissed. Garibaldi afterwards went back to his home in Caprera, and his later relations with the King and the royal government were often tense. However, Victor Emmanuel <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>confirmed</b> Türr's rank as a general but also made him a royal aide-de-camp, and subsequently entrusted to Türr the handling of some sensitive diplomatic matters. Despite this divergence of political courses, however, Türr remained on highly cordial and friendly relations with Garibaldi until the Italian revolutionary's death in 1882.|$|E

25|$|The Great Qing Legal Code (《大清律例》) was {{the last}} set of Chinese laws where the {{complete}} kinship terms were shown. The Qing code <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>confirmed</b> the importance of defining kinship relations, but also defined the legal and moral conducts between family relations. Although there was no specific statute in the Qing code to define kinship terms, it specified the mourning attire and ritual appropriate according to {{the relation between the}} mourner and the deceased. Kinship relationships also {{played a crucial role in}} the administration of justice under the Qing. Penalties were more severe for crimes committed against senior relatives within the family hierarchy. Crimes committed against those outside of the extended family were punished less harshly. Crimes committed by senior family members against their inferiors were least likely to elicit harsh sentences.|$|E

[...] The results, published with David B. Hall, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>confirmed</b> the proportionality between particle momentum and the mean free path of mesotrons before decay that is expected on the basis of relativity theory, but also presented an improved estimate of the lifetime at rest: (2.4±0.3)microseconds. [...] These results and those of the previous year were not only the first to show definitively that mesotrons are unstable, but also the first experimental confirmation of the time dilation of moving clocks predicted by relativity theory.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, a {{conspiracy}} theorist and self-proclaimed [...] "Christian numerologist" [...] named David Meade revived the Nibiru cataclysm by tying it to various {{passages from the}} Bible. He initially predicted that Nibiru would arrive in October of 2017, but he later revised the date to 23 September, referring to a supposedly unique configuration on that date of the Sun, Moon, and planets in Virgo, and citing the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 as a harbinger. His claims received extensive media attention. Viral fake news stories circulated across the internet, falsely claiming that NASA had <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>confirmed</b> Nibiru's existence, but also {{announced that it was}} [...] "headed straight for Earth". In reality, NASA has repeatedly and emphatically denied Nibiru's existence. Meade also faced criticism from fellow Christians; Ed Stetzer, writing for Christianity Today, stated that [...] "there {{is no such thing as}} a 'Christian numerologist'", and described Meade as [...] "a made-up expert in a made-up field talking about a made-up event." [...] Christopher M. Graney, a professor with the Vatican Observatory Foundation, noted that the supposedly unique event was, in fact, quite common, having occurred four times in the last millennium.|$|E

500|$|Ibn Tulun's {{stepfather}} Bakbak {{was murdered}} in 869/70, but luckily {{for him in the}} summer of 871 the supervision of Egypt passed to his father-in-law Yarjukh. Yarjukh <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>confirmed</b> Ibn Tulun in his post, but in addition conferred to him the authority over Alexandria and Barqa. In 873, Ibn Tulun entrusted the government of Alexandria to his eldest son, [...] Abbas. Ibn Tulun's growing power was manifested in the establishment of a new palace city to the northeast of Fustat, called al-Qata'i, in 870. The project was a conscious emulation of, and rival to, the Abbasid capital Samarra. Just like Samarra, the new city was designed as quarters for Ibn Tulun's new army with the aim of reducing frictions with the urban populace of Fustat. Each unit received an allotment or ward (whence the city's name) to settle, after which the ward was named. The new city's centrepiece was the Mosque of Ibn Tulun, which was built in 878–880 {{under the supervision of the}} Mesopotamian Christian architect Ibn Katib al-Farghani. A royal palace adjoined the mosque, and the rest of the city was laid out around them. Beside government buildings, it included markets, a hospital (al-bimāristān) that provided services free of charge, and a hippodrome. Nevertheless, Ibn Tulun himself preferred to reside in the Coptic monastery of Qusayr outside Fustat.|$|E

2500|$|The Kurgan {{hypothesis}} {{describes the}} initial spread of Proto-Indo-European during the 5th and 4th millennia BC.

This idea of the PIE language and its daughter-languages diffusing east and west without mass movement proved popular with archaeologists in the 1970s (the pots-not-people paradigm). The question of further Indo-Europeanization of Central and Western Europe, Central Asia and Northern India during the Bronze Age is beyond its scope, far more uncertain than the events of the Copper Age, and subject to some controversy.

Wellesley ascribes the necessity of a convention) could surely never have been anticipated; and therefore the British army was, even after that loss, in as prosperous a state as it had from the first any right to expect. Hence it is to be inferred, that Sir A.W. must have entered on this campaign with a predetermination to grant a convention in any case, excepting in one single case which he knew to be in the gift of only very extraordinary good fortune.
