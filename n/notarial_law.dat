5000|$|Louisiana notaries {{public are}} {{commissioned}} by the Governor. They are the only notaries to be appointed for life. The Louisiana notary public is a civil law notary with broad powers, as authorized by law, usually reserved for the American style combination [...] "barrister/solicitor" [...] lawyers and other legally authorized practitioners in other states. A commissioned notary in Louisiana is a civil law notary that can perform/prepare many civil <b>law</b> <b>notarial</b> acts usually associated with attorneys and other legally authorized practitioners in other states, except represent another person or entity before {{a court of law}} for a fee (unless they are also admitted to the bar). Notaries are not allowed to give [...] "legal" [...] advice, but they are allowed to give [...] "notarial" [...] advice - i.e., explain or recommend what documents are needed or required to perform a certain act - and do all things necessary or incidental to the performance of their civil <b>law</b> <b>notarial</b> duties. They can prepare any document a civil law notary can prepare (to include inventories, appraisements, partitions, wills, protests, matrimonial contracts, conveyances, and, generally, all contracts and instruments in writing) and, if ordered or requested to by a judge, prepare certain notarial legal documents, in accordance with law, to be returned and filed with that court of law.|$|R

Student notaries must complete a long apprenticeship or articled clerkship as a trainee notary and usually spend some years as a junior associate in a notarial firm before working as a partner or opening a private practice. Any such practice is usually tightly regulated, and most countries parcel out areas into notarial districts with a set number of notary positions.

40|$|Even in {{the days}} of an ever closer European union, Europe {{contains}} no less than four different legal cultures with respect to real estate conveyances: the Latin-German notary system, the deregulated Dutch notary system, the lawyer/solicitor system, and the Scandinavian licensed real estate broker system. The latter is of particular interest in that Scandinavian brokers play a far larger role in real estate transactions than their European counterparts. This paper examines and compares the Swedish real estate broker and the Latin notary. The Swedish broker is required by law to act as an impartial intermediary, to provide counseling to both parties, and to assist in drawing up all contracts and other documents necessary for the transaction at hand. To that end, the broker must be active and observant of the particular needs of the parties to the present transaction, always striving to enable them to reach equitable and practical agreements so as to prevent future disputes. In other words, the broker is required to tailor the transaction to fit the needs of the buyer and seller. The Latin notary profession prevails in large parts of the world, particularly the Latin-German parts of continental Europe, and Latin America. While there are divergences in the <b>notarial</b> <b>laws</b> of all countries, the similarities are greater still, and it is correct to speak of a single profession throughout all these countries. The notary carries out several important functions, the nexus of which is the authentication of legal documents. In the preparation of these documents, the notary is required to provide impartial counseling in order to tailor the transaction at hand to fit the will and needs of the parties. To uphold the integra fama of the profession, and to safeguard the proper performance of the notarial functions, lawgivers in all countries emphasize the importance of impartiality and integrity. There are national divergences as to the specific rules of conduct related to impartiality, particularly those concerning what activities are considered incompatible with the notariat, but they rest on common principles. Most importantly, not only must the publica fides be honored, it must be seen {{in the eyes of the}} public to be honored. The organization and regulation of the notary profession raises important economic issues, particularly with regard to competition/monopoly and market failures. The discussion of the regulation or deregulation of the notariat is by no means settled. Comparing the two professions, it is striking to see the enormous similarities in the legal frameworks and their respective rationales. Two common features are of particular interest. Firstly, both the Swedish broker and the Latin notary are required to assist the contracting parties in the contract phase, drawing up any necessary documents and counseling the parties as to the implications of the transaction. In that respect, both professions function as tailors to the transaction. Secondly, both the broker and the notary are required to act impartially and independently – impartially visavi the contracting parties, and independently in order to preserve the public faith in the independence and integrity of the professions. The similarities can be summarized as a function on the real estate market: impartial counseling and contract-engineering. This function exists alongside other functions, such as the brokers’ traditional matchmaking, or the registration of property rights. This functional approach may prove very useful in all kinds of analyses of the real estate market, whether of political, legal, or economic nature. For instance, with respect to the merits and/or necessity of the Swedish impartiality rule, those wishing to amend the law and introduce a system of overtly partial brokers acting solely on behalf of their principal have to face the question of what is to become of counseling for the principal’s counterpart. Should the counterpart be forced to choose between hiring their own legal counsel or make do without? Further, those wishing to contest the mandatory notarial intervention in real estate transactions have to face the same question: what is to happen to impartial counseling, given not only to the client but also to the client’s counterpart? Both instances illustrate the common feature shared by the two examined professions: impartial contract-engineering and counseling. To complete the picture and cover the whole arena of real estate transactions, the next logical step is therefore to compare and analyze different systems for registration of property rights. Doing so will hopefully achieve a tool for examining the real estate market that will prove useful indeed, particularly in future discussions concerning European harmonization. QC 2010111...|$|R

The Graduate Program in <b>Notarial</b> <b>Law,</b> Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta 2015. This {{research}} are studies how the legal force of covernotes {{is and what}} constraints are encountered by bank {{in the implementation of}} prudential banking principle on the finance with covernotes by notaries/conveyancers as requirements for loan disbursement. This research used the descriptive empirical research method. It was conducted at the limited liability company of PT Bank Pembiayaan Rakyat Syariah Insan Madani Sukoharjo, a notary office in Klaten Regency, and a notary officer in Surakarta City. The data of research consisted of primary and secondary ones. They were collected through in-depth interview and library research. They were analyzed by using the interactive model of analysis. The result of research shows that cover note is a certificate to explain that there is a legal event taking place before a notary/a conveyancer. The existence of cover notes in banking business provides a confidence, a trust, and a sense of security for banks in finance disbursement. The cover notes do not bear a legal force and do not guarantee a legal certainty because they are not authentic deeds. In addition, none of the articles of Law Number 2 of 2014 regarding Amendment to Law Number 30 of 2004 regarding Notary Profession and Government Regulation Number: 37 of 1998 interprets the duties and authorities of notaries/conveyancers to issue cover notes. The cover notes occur due to the practice and need in banking business so that they only bound between the bank and notaries/conveyancers morally. The implementation of prudential banking principle on the finance with covernotes as requirements for finance disbursement at the limited liability company of PT BPRS Insan Madani Sukoharjo encounters some problems due to the following : There is not any explicit covernote regulation in laws and regulations, The bank are lack of legal consequence understanding, the competition among sharia banks is tough, the administrative requirements for the finance disbursement are less completed, the arrangement of it at the Land Office requires much time; and many problems occur due to the debtors.
