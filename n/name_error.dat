The results revealed that the MS group produced significantly more <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> than the control subjects, particularly those responses semantically related to the target word. No relationship, perceptual, phonological and unrecognised correct errors were the least frequently occurring responses. As a group, the MS subjects 2 ̆ 7 <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> appeared to reflect a lexical semantic accessing deficit. Individual subjects, however, found to produce high frequencies of perceptual <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> which may have been explained by optic nerve disturbances.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the study was to analyze <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> in {{patients}} with Alz­heimer’s disease in comparison to healthy subjects and determine the underlying cause of <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> in these patients. Method: In this study, we included 35 healthy elderly subjects, 23 patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease, and 23 with moderate Alzheimer’s disease. Forty-five images were used to determine the type of <b>naming</b> <b>errors,</b> and to identify the underlying cause of errors, matching an image with a written word was used. Results: Patients with Alz­heimer’s disease had more <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> compared with the group of healthy elderly, and patients with moderate Alzheimer’s disease showed a slower reaction in matching an image with a written word. Conclusion: Anomia in the initial phase of Alzheimer’s disease is due to problems in lexical retrieval; however, as the disease advances, in addition to lexical retrieval problems, conceptual knowledge causes naming problems...|$|R
40|$|In two studies, the <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> of {{individuals}} with naming impairment following stroke, Alzheimer's dementia and traumatic brain injury (TEl) were compared. Study 1 compared the errors of mild to moderately naming impaired individuals following stroke (n= 20), AD (n = 20), and TEl (n = 20), who were given a confrontation <b>naming</b> test. An <b>error</b> {{analysis was used to}} determine whether patterns existed within or across groups. Although each of these groups showed patterns in their <b>naming</b> <b>errors,</b> the differences were subtle. The particular types of <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> were distributed differently among the three groups. A more consistent finding was a trend in all three groups toward more semantic errors in those with mild naming impairment and fewer semantic error in those with more severe naming impairment. In the stroke and TEl groups there was a trend of more irrelevant errors in those with more severe naming impairment and fewer irrelevant errors 100 in those with mild naming impairment. In Study 2, four groups {{of individuals}} post-stroke were given the same naming test. These groups were labeled high comprehension fluent (n = 17), low comprehension fluent (n = 10), low comprehension nonfluent (n = 11), and high comprehension non fluent (n = 10). Few <b>naming</b> <b>error</b> differences were found between groups, and these few differences were subtle. However the pattern in Study 1 also occurred for the subjects in Study 2. Individuals with milder naming impairment had a high frequency of semantic errors across the four groups. Individuals with more severe naming impairment had a high frequency of irrelevant errors, across the four groups. In the <b>naming</b> <b>error</b> literature two main issues are addressed. First, are different populations of naming impaired individuals affected differentially or, alternatively, is the severity of naming impairment a more salient determinant of <b>naming</b> <b>error</b> pattern.

Proper names are semantically rich {{and are usually}} key to understanding {{the information contained in}} a document. Our work focuses on increasing the vocabulary coverage of a speech transcription system by automatically retrieving proper names from contemporary diachronic text documents. We proposed methods that dynamically augment the automatic speech recognition system vocabulary using lexical and temporal features in diachronic documents.

40|$|The {{development}} of an automatic speech recognizer (ASR) that can accurately recognize spoken names belonging to a large lexicon, is still a big challenge. One of the bottlenecks is that many names contain elements of a foreign language origin, and native speakers can adopt very different pronunciations of these elements, ranging from completely nativized to completelyforeignized pronunciations. In this paper we further develop a recently proposed method for improving the recognition of foreign proper names spoken by native speakers. The main idea is to combine the standard acoustic model scores with scores emerging from a phonologically inspired back-off model that was trained on native speech only. This means that the proposed method {{does not require the}} {{development of}} any foreign phoneme models on foreign speech data. By applying our method on a baseline Dutch recognizer (comprising Dutch acoustic models) we could reduce the <b>name</b> <b>error</b> rate for French and English names by a considerable amount...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Automatic speech {{recognition}} (ASR), the transcription of human speech into text form, {{is used in}} many settings in our society, ranging from customer service applications to personal assistants on mobile devices. In all such settings {{it is important for}} the system to know when it is making errors, so that it may ask the user to rephrase or restate their previous utterance. Such errors are often syntactically anomalous. The primary goal of this thesis is to find novel uses of parsing for automatic detection and correction of ASR errors. We start by developing a framework for ASR rescoring and automatic error detection leveraging syntactic parsing in conjunction with a maximum entropy classifier, and find that parsing helps with error detection, even when the parser is trained on out-of-domain data. In particular, features capturing parser reliability are used to improve the detection of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and name errors. However, parsers trained on out-of-domain treebanks do not provide any benefit to ASR rescoring. This observation motivates our work on domain adaptation of parsing, with the objective of directly improving both transcription accuracy and error detection. We develop two weakly supervised domain adaptation methods which use error labels, but no hand-annotated parses: a self-training approach to directly improve the probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) model used in parsing, as well as a novel model combination method using a discriminative log-linear model to augment the generative PCFG. We apply both methods to ASR rescoring and error detection tasks. We find that self-training improves the ability of our parser to select the correct ASR hypothesis. The log-linear adaptation improves both OOV and <b>name</b> <b>error</b> detection tasks, and self-training performed after log-linear adaptation further improves the reliability of the parser, while producing smaller, faster models. Finally, motivated by empirical observations that the presence of names in an utterance is often indicated by words located far apart from the names themselves, we develop a general long-distance phrase pattern learning algorithm using word-level semantic similarity measures, and apply it to the problem of <b>name</b> <b>error</b> detection. This novel feature learning method leads to more robust classification, both when used independently of parsing, and in conjunction with parse features...|$|E

40|$|Functional {{models of}} face {{recognition}} and speech production have developed separately. However, naming {{a familiar face}} is, of course, an act of speech production. In this {{paper we propose a}} revision of Bruce and Young's (1986) model of face processing, which incorporates two features of Levelt's (1989) model of speech production. In particular, the proposed model includes two stages of lexical access for names and monitoring of face naming based on a "perceptual loop". Two predictions were derived from the perceptual loop hypothesis of speech monitoring: (1) <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> in which a (correct) rare surname is erroneously replaced by a common surname should occur more frequently than the reverse substitution (the error asymmetry effect); (2) <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> in which a common surname is articulated {{are more likely to be}} repaired than errors which result in articulation of a rare surname (the error-repairing effect). Both predictions were supported by an analysis of face <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> in a laboratory face naming task. In a further experiment we considered the possibility that the effects of surname frequency observed in face <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> could be explained by the frequency sensitivity of lexical access in speech production. However, no effect of the frequency of the surname of the faces used in the previous experiment was found on face naming latencies. Therefore, it is concluded that the perceptual loop hypothesis provides the more parsimonious account of the entire pattern of the results...|$|R

One approach for increasing the vocabulary coverage of a speech transcription system is to automatically retrieve new proper names from contemporary diachronic text documents. In recent years, neural networks have been successfully applied to a variety of speech recognition tasks.

This is achieved by using high-quality word vector representation of words from large amounts of unstructured text data proposed by Mikolov. This model allows to take into account lexical and semantic word relationships. Proposed methodology is evaluated in the context of broadcast news transcription.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} an intriguing phenomenon {{that did not}} receive much attention so far: repeatedly calling a familiar person with someone else’s name. From participants’ responses to a questionnaire, these repeated <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> were characterized {{with respect to a}} number of properties (e. g., type of <b>names</b> being substituted, <b>error</b> frequency, error longevity) and different features of similarity (e. g., age, gender, type of relationship with the participant, face resemblance and similarity of the contexts of encounter) between the bearer of the target name and the bearer of the wrong name. Moreover, it was evaluated whether the phonological similarity between names, the participants’ age, the difference of age between the two persons whose names were substituted, and face resemblance between the two persons predicted the frequency of error. Regression analyses indicated that phonological similarity between the target name and the wrong name predicted the frequency of repeated person <b>naming</b> <b>errors.</b> The age of the participant was also a significant predictor of error frequency: the older the participant the higher the frequency of errors. Consistent with previous research stressing the importance of the age of acquisition of words on lexical access in speech production, results indicated that bearer of the wrong name was on average known for longer than the bearer of the target name...|$|R

The child was thought to either have language functions located his right brain hemisphere (switched dominance), or to have mixed hemispheric dominance for language, and so represents an atypical case. A period of intensive language therapy utilizing approaches aimed at strengthening semantic networks for word-retrieval was completed. The child showed progress on goals related to semantic network strengthening, but formal test scores using picture stimuli indicated marginal improvement. Further analysis of test error types was completed, revealing a continued high percentage of errors that were visually related. Visually related <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> would be more typically expected after right hemisphere damage, reflecting a visual agnosia. Conclusions about this child’s individual brain organization are reached. Implications for assessment and treatment of word-retrieval and/or vocabulary learning deficits in cases of switched or mixed language dominance are discussed.

Interventions to prevent these errors {{at the point of}} prescribing have had limited success. The {{purpose of this study is}} to measure whether indication alerts at the time of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) can intercept drug <b>name</b> confusion <b>errors.</b> A retrospective observational study of alerts provided to prescribers in a public, tertiary hospital and ambulatory practice with medication orders placed using CPOE. Consecutive patients seen from April 2006 through February 2012 were eligible if a clinician received an indication alert during ordering. A total of 54, 499 unique patients were included. The computerized decision support system prompted prescribers to enter indications when certain medications were ordered without a coded indication in the electronic problem list. Alerts required prescribers either to ignore them by clicking OK, to place a problem in the problem list, or to cancel the order. Main outcome was the proportion of indication alerts resulting in the interception of drug <b>name</b> confusion <b>errors.</b> Error interception was determined using an algorithm to identify instances in which an alert triggered, the initial medication order was not completed, and the same prescriber ordered a similar-sounding medication on the same patient within 5 minutes. Similarity was defined using standard text similarity measures. Two clinicians performed chart review of all cases to determine whether the first, non-completed medication order had a documented or non-documented, plausible indication for use. If either reviewer found a plausible indication, the case was not considered an error.

40|$|Portions of left {{inferior}} frontal cortex {{have been}} linked to semantic memory both in terms of the content of conceptual representation (e. g., motor aspects in an embodied semantics framework) and the cognitive processes used to access these representations (e. g., response selection). Progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by progressive atrophy of left inferior frontal cortex. PNFA can, therefore, provide a lesion model for examining the impact of frontal lobe damage on semantic processing and content. In the current study we examined picture naming in a cohort of PNFA patients across a variety of semantic categories. An embodied approach to semantic memory holds that sensorimotor features such as self-initiated action may assume differential importance for the representation of manufactured artifacts (e. g., naming hand tools). Embodiment theories might therefore predict that patients with frontal damage would be differentially impaired on manufactured artifacts relative to natural kinds, and this prediction was borne out. We also examined patterns of <b>naming</b> <b>errors</b> across a wide range of semantic categories and found that <b>naming</b> <b>error</b> distributions were heterogeneous.
