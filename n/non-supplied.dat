40|$|Agricultural {{irrigation}} system {{is required to}} be designed economically and should be reliable with minimal suspension in water supply. This study suggests a multi-criteria design approach for irrigation pipe network systems. A system reliability is suggested as a second objective, which is defined as annual <b>non-supplied</b> volume of water by considering pipe failure. The <b>non-supplied</b> water is quantified based on the expected number of pipe failure and pipe repair time. A hydraulic simulator(EPANET) is linked with a heuristic-search optimization algorithm(Genetic Algorithm, GA) for least-cost system design. Once the least-cost design is determined, the system reliability is calculated for the obtained optimal design. In order to evaluate the relation between system cost and water-supply reliability, three layouts(two branch- and a looped-networks) were suggested for least-cost design and reli-ability estimation.

40|$|Power-electronic {{inverters}} {{are becoming}} popular for various industrial drives applications. In recent years also high-power and medium-voltage drive applications have been installed. However, the existing solutions suffer from some important drawbacks. Hybrid asymmetric multi-level inverters promise significant improvements for medium-voltage applications. This dissertation investigates such a hybrid inverter. To simplify the topology, some inverter parts are {{deprived of their}} feeding from the net and can only supply reactive power. The <b>non-supplied</b> intermediate-circuit capacitor voltages are inherently unstable and require a suitable control method for converter operation, preferably without influence on the load. Apart from normal operation, also converter start-up is an issue to consider, {{for which it is}} desirable to limit additional equipment. In this dissertation, we investigate the behaviour of this new inverter, and develop methods to obtain its reliable operation for the considered applications. These methods include modulation, voltage stabilization and start-up. We establish suitable models for their foundation. The principle achievement of this work is the development of a control method to stabilize a multitude of capacitor voltages which have no equilibrium state. Power balancing is performed by varying the common-mode output voltage, using a non-linear model-predictive controller. This method, which is new to power electronics, is applied to our hybrid asymmetric nine-level inverter driving an asynchronous motor. Computer simulations and measurements on an experimental drive system demonstrate stable behaviour in steady-state and during transients over the whole operating range. The obtained results prove the possible implementation of such a complex control algorithm for fast real-time operation. As second important accomplishment, this thesis proposes a start-up method that charges the <b>non-supplied</b> intermediate-circuit capacitors in parallel with the supplied ones, without additional equipment. Measurements show its successful application in the investigated drive system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The vast {{majority}} of the developed planning methods for power distribution systems consider only one objective function to optimize. This function represents the economical costs of the systems. However, there are other planning aspects that should be considered but they can not be expressed in terms of costs; therefore, they need to be formulated as separate objective functions. This paper presents a new multi-objective planning method for power distribution systems. The method is based on the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2. The edge-set encoding technique and the constrain-domination concept were applied to handle the problem constraints. The method was tested on a real large-scale system with two objective functions: economical cost and energy <b>non-supplied.</b> From these results, {{it can be said that}} the proposed method is suitable to resolve the multi-objective problem of large-scale power distribution system expansion planning. ...|$|E

Observations were made on leaf and branch production of rooted ramets and unrooted main stolon of the clone. The dry weight of the component of clone was also recorded. There was a very localized response to nutrient supply with the growth response largely restricted to nutrient supplied ramet and to the unrooted main stolon where the nutrient supplied ramet was in adjacent position. However, it was noted that very severe symptoms of nutrient deficiency gradually appeared in ramets deprived of nutrients and presumably would eventually die with time. Ramets supplied with nutrients showed a significantly greater production of leaves and branch ramet and dry weight. Nutrient movement with the stolon axis is therefore distinctly acropetal to the exploratory growth of the stolon and is maintained of the older ramets which with time must senesce and die...|$|E

40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo elucidar, por meio da pirólise analítica acoplada à cromatografia gasosa e espectrometria de massa, alterações na composição química da lignina nas bainhas de plantas de arroz das {{cultivar}}es BR-Irga 409 e Labelle supridas ou não com silício (Si) e infectadas por Rhizoctonia solani. A concentração de Si nas bainhas das plantas supridas com esse elemento foi significativamente maior (2, 7 dag kg- 1) em comparação com as plantas não supridas (0, 45 dag kg- 1). Na presença de Si, a área abaixo da curva do progresso da queima das bainhas foi significativamente reduzida em 19 e 25 %, respectivamente, para as plantas das cultivares BR-Irga- 409 e Labelle em relação à ausência desse elemento na solução nutritiva. Com base nos espectros de massas obtidos, foram identificados 33 compostos, dos quais 10 foram produtos da degradação de carboidratos e 23 derivados da lignina. Dentre os derivados da lignina, oito compostos eram do tipo p-hidroxifenila, 11 compostos do tipo guaiacila e quatro compostos do tipo siringila. Nas bainhas das plantas das duas cultivares de arroz, supridas ou não com Si, a concentração de lignina (p-hidroxifenila, siringila (S) e guaiacila (G)) foi de, aproximadamente, 15 %. Houve aumento na relação S/G apenas nas bainhas das plantas da cultivar BR-Irga 409 supridas com Si e infectadas por R. solani. A maior concentração de Si nas bainhas das plantas de arroz das duas cultivares, que por sua vez resultou em aumento na relação S/G, contribuiu para reduzir os sintomas da queima das bainhas. This study elucidated, through analytical pyrolysis {{coupled to}} gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, {{changes in the}} chemical composition of lignin on leaf sheaths of rice plants of cultivars BR-Irga 409 and Labelle supplied or <b>non-supplied</b> with silicon (Si) and infected with Rhizoctonia solani. The Si concentration on leaf sheaths of plants supplied with this element was significatively higher (2. 7 dag kg- 1) as compared to <b>non-supplied</b> plants (0. 45 dag kg- 1). In the presence of Si, the area under leaf sheath blight progress curve was significantly reduced by 19 and 25 % for plants from cultivars BR-Irga 409 and Labelle, respectively, {{in comparison to the}} absence of Si. Based on the mass spectra obtained, 33 compounds were identified, 10 of which were products from the degradation of carbohydrates and 23 derivate from lignin. From lignin derivatives, eight compounds were p-hydroxiphenil type, eleven compounds were guaiacyl type and four compounds were syringyl type. On leaf sheaths of both cultivars, the concentration of lignin (p-hydroxiphenil, syringyl (S) and guaiacyl (G)) was around 15 %, regardless of Si. There was no increase in the S/G ratio only for the leaf sheaths of BR-Irga 409 supplied with Si and infected with R. solani. High Si concentration on leaf sheaths of both cultivars, which in turn resulted in an increase in the S/G ratio, contributed to reduce leaf sheath blight symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Critical {{infrastructures}} provide {{society with}} services essential to it’s functioning and extensive disruptions of these create large societal consequences. Risk and vulnerability analyses of critical infrastructures generally focus narrowly on {{the infrastructure of}} interest and describe the consequences as <b>non-supplied</b> commodities (e. g. water, power) or the cost of unsupplied commodities, but rarely holistically consider the consequences for society. However, from a societal perspective, this narrow focus may lead to severe underestimation of {{the negative effects of}} infrastructure disruptions. In this paper we analyse and contrast how a narrower infrastructure or a more holistic societal perspective affect risk and vulnerability related decisions regarding critical infrastructures. To this end we propose an integrated modelling approach, combining models of critical infrastructures and inoperability input-output models (IIM). The approach is demonstrated in a case study with a representative model of the Swedish power transmission system and using national economic accounts. Two decision-contexts related to prioritizing between different vulnerability reducing measures is considered (identifying critical components and adding system components). We conclude that taking a societal perspective when analysing infrastructure vulnerability reducing measures is important, in particular when identifying critical components to protect {{and to a lesser extent}} when ranking improvement measures in terms of adding system components, but could be of importance if under budgetary constraints, e. g. if only a limited amount of improvements can be implemented, or when deciding the priority order of which measures to implement when, given that large scale infrastructure improvement projects operates in the time-horizon of up to decades...|$|E
40|$|Electricity is {{the most}} {{preferred}} source of energy, because of its quality and convenience of usage. It {{is probably one of}} the most vital infrastructural inputs for economic development of a country. Indeed it is the fulcrum which can leverage the future pace of growth and development. These reasons have made the electric power industry one of the fastest growing sectors in most developing countries and particularly in India. Therefore it is not surprising to observe the economic growth of a country being related to the increase in electricity consumption. In India, the growth rate of demand for power is generally higher than that of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, to achieve this kind of growth in electricity supply, the capital investments required are very huge. Even though the electricity sector generally gels a major share in the budgetary allocations in India, this is inadequate to add the required quantum of new generation capacity to keep pace with the increase in demand for electricity. Additional constraints like capital scarcity in the public sector, lack of enthusiasm among the private and foreign investors, and strong opposition from the environmentalists have further contributed to this slow pace of new generating capacity addition. This has resulted in severely constrained systems in India. The main focus of the present research work is on the development of an integrated approach for electricity planning using a mathematical modeling framework in (he context of resource constrained systems. There are very few attempts in the literature to integrate short, medium and long term issues in electricity planning. This is understandable from the point of view of unconstrained electricity systems where this type of integration is unnecessary since such systems have a luxury of surplus capacity to meet the current demand and capacity additions are required only for meeting predicted future increase in demand. However, in the case of constrained electricity systems, which are characterized by shortages, this kind of integration is very essential. These systems have to manage with inadequate capacity in the present, plan capacity additions to bridge the existing gap and to meet future increase in demand, and always explore the possibility of adding capacity with short gestation period. The integrated approach is expected to achieve effective supply-demand matching on a continuous basis encompassing both the short term and long term horizons. To achieve this, we have considered three alternatives- existing supply, new supply and <b>non-supply</b> (rationing) of electricity. The electricity system of the state of Karnataka, which is severely constrained by both limited capital and energy resources, has been selected for this purpose. As a first step, the supply and demand situation has been studied in the context of resource constraints. In terms of supply, both existing and future additions are studied in detail with respect to the potential created, generation types, import potential, technical constraints, energy and power shortages, planned and proposed capacity additions by both public and private sectors, etc. The demand patterns have been studied by introducing a new concept of "Representative Load Curves (RLCs) ". These RLCs are used to model the temporal and structural variations in demand for electricity. Also, appropriate <b>non-supply</b> options (rationing measures) for effective management of shortages are identified. Incorporating this information, an integrated mathematical model, which is expected to generate a target plan for a detailed generation scheduling exercises and a requirement plan for a regular generation expansion planning, has been developed. The other important alternative "Demand-Side-Management (DSM) ", which could be considered as an effective option to achieve efficient supply-demand matching has not been included in the present research work. The major reason for not including the DSM alternatives is due to the difficulty in integrating these in the modelling approach adopted here. In the present approach we have used typical daily load curves (RLCs) to represent the demand for electricity. These are aggregate load curves and do not contain any sector-wise or end-use-wisc details. On the other hand, DSM alternatives are end-use focused. To incorporate DSM alternatives, we should have information on end-usc-wisc power demand (kW or MW), savings potential, time-of-use, etc. For this purpose it may be required to have end-use-wisc daily load curves. This information is not available and a separate detailed survey may be required to generate these load curves. This, we felt, is out of the scope of this present research work and a separate study may be required to do this. Therefore, we restricted our focus to supply planning alone. A detailed literature review is conducted to understand different types of modeling approaches to electricity planning. For the present study, however, the review of literature has been restricted to the methods of generation expansion planning and scheduling. In doing so, we attempted to bring out the differences in various approaches in terms of solution methods adopted, alternatives included and modifications suggested. Also, we briefly reviewed the literature on models for power and energy rationing, because management of shortages is an important aspect of the present study. Subsequently, a separate section is devoted to present an overview of the <b>non-supply</b> of electricity and its economic impacts on the consumers. We found that the low reliability of the electrical system is an indicator of the existence of severe shortages of power and energy, which cause <b>non-supply</b> of electricity to the consumers. The overview also presented a discussion on reasons for <b>non-supply</b> of electricity, and the types of <b>non-supply</b> options the utilities adopt to over come these shortages. We also attempted to explain what we mean by <b>non-supply</b> of electricity, what are its cost implications, and the methods available in the literature to estimate these costs. The first objective of the research pertains to the development of a new approach to model the varying demand for electricity. Using the concept of Representative Load Curves (RLCs) we model the hourly demand for a period of four years, 1993 - 94, 1994 - 95, 1995 - 96 and 1996 - 97, to understand the demand patterns of both unconstrained and constrained years. Multiple discriminant analysis has been used to cluster the 365 load curves into nine RLCs for each of the four years. The results show that these RLCs adequately model the variations in demand and bring out the distinctions in the demand patterns existed during the unconstrained and constrained years. The demand analysis using RLCs helped to study the differences in demand patterns with and without constraints, impacts of constraints on preferred pattern of electricity consumption, success of <b>non-supply</b> options in both reducing the demand levels and greatly disturbing the electricity usage patterns. Multifactor ANOVA analyses are performed to quantify the statistical significance of the ability of the logically obtained factors in explaining the overall variations in demand. The results of the ANOVA analysis clearly showed that the considered factors accounted for maximum variations in demand at very high significance levels. It also brought out the significant influence of rationing measures in explaining the variations in demand during the constrained years. Concerning the second objective, we explained in detail, the development of an integrated mixed integer-programming model, which we felt is appropriate for planning in the case of resource constrained electricity systems. Two types of integrations are attempted (i) existing supply, <b>non-supply</b> and new supply options for dynamically matching supply and demand, (ii) operational and strategic planning in terms of providing target plans for the former and requirement plans for the latter. Broadly, the approach addresses the effective management of existing capacity, optimal rationing plan to effectively manage shortages and rationally decide on the new capacity additions both to bridge the existing gap between supply and demand, and to meet the future increases in demand. There is also an attempt to arrive at an optimal mix of public and private capacity additions for a given situation. Finally, it has been attempted to verify the possibility of integration of captive generation capacity with the grid. Further, we discussed in detail about the data required for the model implementation. The model is validated through the development of a number of scenarios for the state of Karnataka. The base case scenario analyses are carried out for both the unconstrained and constrained years to compare the optimal allocations with actual allocations that were observed, and to find out how sensitive are the results for any change in the values of various parameters. For the constrained years, a few more scenarios are used to compare the optimal practice of managing shortages with to what has been actually followed by the utility. The optimal allocations of the predicted demand to various existing supply and <b>non-supply</b> options clearly showed that the actual practice, reflected by the actual RLCs, are highly ad hoc and sub-optimal. The unit cost comparisons among different scenarios show that the least cost choice of options by the utility does not necessarily lead to good choices from the consumers’ perspective. Further, a number of future scenarios are developed to verify the ability of the model to achieve the overall objective of supply-demand matching both in the short and long term. For this purpose both the short horizon annual scenarios (1997 - 98 to 2000 - 01) and long horizon terminal year scenarios (2005 - 06 and 2010 - 11) are developed assuming capacity additions from only public sector.

Information provided when assessed by the pharmacist was that she had missed one inactive pill of her regular hormonal contraception. The amount of assessment provided and the appropriateness of supply were used as comparative outcome measures. Results: Eighty-three pharmacies used a written assessment checklist. Twenty-four of the pharmacies visited provided the appropriate outcome of <b>non-supply.</b> Pharmacies that used a written assessment checklist provided a greater quantity and consistency of assessment (11. 3 ± 2. 5 v. 6. 5 ± 3. 8 questions, p< 0. 0001) but this did not result in an improved frequency of an appropriate outcome (20 %, n= 16 v. 23 %, n= 3). Conclusions: While a written patient assessment checklist improved the quantity and consistency of patient assessment, it did not improve the advice provided by community pharmacies when handling requests for emergency contraception...|$|R

This paper presents a stochastic programming model to achieve optimal management taking into account price variation in day-ahead and intraday electricity markets, together with regulating reserve margins. In this model, first-stage decisions determine day-ahead energy purchases and sales and the upward and downward reserve margins committed. Second-stage decisions correspond to intraday markets and deal with reserve requirements and several possible scenarios for vehicle staying pattern. The design of the objective function prioritizes supplying energy to EV batteries while minimizing the net expected energy cost at the EV charging point. A case study describing a parking for 50 EVs is analyzed. The case includes household, commercial and mixed EV staying patterns with several intraday arrival and departure scenarios. Pure and hybrid EVs are included, taking into account their respective energy characteristics. Sensitivity analysis is used to show the potential energy cost savings {{and the impact of}} different <b>non-supply</b> penalizations. The case study considers several vehicle staying patterns, energy price profiles and discharge allowances. The model achieves energy cost reductions between 1 % and 15 % depending on the specific case. A model validation by simulation has been done. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The Next Round of {{multilateral}} {{trade negotiations}} under the World Trade Organization is set to begin {{towards the end of}} 1999. This study was initiated to inform, substantiate and aid the development of industry and government negotiation positions for the Round. It was sponsored by Agricore, Alberta Agriculture and Food Council, Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Alberta Intergovernmental and Aboriginal Affairs, the Alberta Sugar Beet Growers, the Canadian Dehydrators Association, the Canadian Oilseed Processors Association, and the Potato Growers of Alberta. Its overall objective was to quantify the net benefits from agricultural trade liberalization in the Next Round of the WTO. The specific objectives may be encapsulated as follows: 1. Assess the relative sizes of the supply managed and <b>non-supply</b> managed segments in Canada's agri-food sector with the view to understanding the implications of trade liberalization on these segments. 2. Examine the implications of trade liberalization on trade by degree of value-adding. 3. Estimate the extent and distribution of government support to agriculture in Canada on a regional basis. 4. Quantify the net benefits from elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers to the agri-food sector and the economy. 5. Evaluate the impact of emerging trade issues (e. g., food safety, genetically modified organisms and biotechnology) on Canada's agri-food industries. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{defining}} sediment supply conditions is of fundamental {{importance in the}} prediction of bedload discharge in alluvial channels, because most bedload equations were developed based on the general assumption that the rates at which sediment becomes available for transport equal the sediment-transport capacity of the flow. The classification of availability of sediment on the accuracy and applicability of seven bedload equations in alluvial channels is described and discussed in this dissertation. Historical hydraulic and sedimentological data from 22 alluvial channels of the United States are used to define the sediment-transport regimes and to compare predicted and measured bedload discharges. Exponential relations between sediment supply end energy are used to show if at a reach scale a channel has supply-limited or <b>non-supply</b> limited regime based on the statistical variations of bedload-transport rates with stream power. The root-mean-square error and the inequality coefficients are use to assess the bedload equation's ability to reproduce the trend of the measured values, whereas the discrepancy ratio is {{used to evaluate the}} equation's ability to reproduce individual measured data. Relations between the median particle-size ratio, which quantifies the coarseness or fineness of the channel bed, and the discrepancy ratio are used to illustrate process controlling the accuracy of bedload equations. Information presented here shows that an understanding of channel's sediment regime in the process of bedload prediction improves the applicability of bedload equations in alluvial channels...|$|R
30|$|Large {{numbers of}} {{households}} in Indian cities {{do not have}} access to one of the most basic of human needs—a safe and reliable supply of drinking water. As per McKenzie-Ray (2009), only half of all Indian urban households have a piped water connection, even those with a connection generally do not receive a regular supply of good quality water. The municipal water supply in most Indian cities is only available for a few hours per day, pressure is irregular, and the water is of questionable quality. No major Indian city has a 24  h supply of water, intermittent supply with 4 – 5  h of supply per day being the norm as compared to the Asian- Pacific average of 19  h per day supply (McKenzie-Ray 2009). Intermittent supply of water leads to health risks for users due to the higher likelihood of contamination of water pipelines through joints and damaged segments during periods when the system is not pressurized. Due to excessive growth in population, the service area is divided into few zones and each zone is supplied the water for limited hours which leads to the stagnation of water during <b>non-supply</b> hours and decay of chlorine for rest of the hours. Also, there is a problem related to maintenance of pressure at the farthest node in intermittent water supply. To cope up with the decay in chlorine, higher mass rate of chlorine is applied at the source to maintain the minimum residual chlorine up to the farthest end, which results in harmful DBP formation at the nearest locations to the source and less concentration of residual chlorine at farthest location. Thus, the objectives of microbial-free water with proper quantity and pressure is difficult to achieve through conventional water supply networks without targeting continuous water supply and constantly pressurized system (CPHEEO 1999; MoUD 2009) Given the health imperatives and other inconveniences caused by intermittent water supply, it is unfortunate that virtually no city in India has continuous water supply (CPHEEO 1999).|$|R
40|$|India {{suffers from}} {{widespread}} shortages of electricity supply. These shortages, among others, are {{detrimental to the}} economic growth. The prospects {{for the next decade}} {{do not seem to be}} much brighter. Efforts in expanding generation capacity by the state-owned electric utilities are hampered by severe resource constraints. Against this backdrop, to mobilize additional resources to help bridge the gap in demand and supply, the Government of India formulated a policy in 1991 with the objective to encourage greater investment by private enterprises in the electricity sector. To study the implications of such an initiative on various stakeholders, viz., public utilities, consumers and private sector, the present paper tries to analyse issues like planned rationing, guarantees to private sector, backing down of existing capacity. Using the state of Karnataka (in Southern India) as a case study, the paper develops multiple scenarios using an integrated mixed integer-programming model. The results show the advantage of marginal <b>non-supply</b> (rationing) of electricity in terms of achieving overall effective supply demand matching as well as providing economic benefits to the state that could be generated through cost savings. The results also show the negative impacts of high guarantees offered to the private sector in terms of the opportunity costs of reduced utilization of both the existing and the new public capacity. The estimated generation losses and the associated economic impacts of backing down of existing and new public capacity on account of guarantees are found to be significantly high. For 2011 - 12, depending on the type of scenarios, the estimated generation and economic losses are likely to be in the range of 3200 - 10, 000 GWh and Rs. 4200 - 13, 600 million respectively. The impact of these losses on the consumers could be in terms of significant increase in energy bills (in the range of 19 - 40 % for different scenarios) due to rise in tariffs...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{presents}} the results and recommendations stemming from a baseline survey {{on the nature of}} marketing farm supplies in Totu Division, Nyori District. The survey was conducted among retail traders in the Division early this year. It was concerned with determining the degree to which crucial farm inputs were available in Division, especially deep within the rural areas. It focussed particularly upon the availability and distribution of those inputs necessary for effective hybrid maize husbandry as an example, paying special attention to the need for repackaging these inputs in smaller quantities and for relabeling them with more meaningful terminology. Other issues investigated include determining the accuracy with which stockists estimate the seasonal purchasing needs of their clients {{and the degree to which}} main supplies are engaged in delivering inputs to stockists. Since the present study is a concomitant of the parent study, the Totu Extension Pilot Project, recommendations are cast in the light of this parent study. Thus, the study concludes that the problem of farm supplies in Totu Division may be summarized as undersupply in some areas part of the time, and <b>non-supply</b> in other areas most of the time. This problem is made worse by packaging of some supplies which is too bulky for the needs of many farmers arid package labelling which is product rather than use oriented. One way of overcoming these problems is by extending loans from commercial banking sources to farm supply stockists to enable them to carry a comprehensive and adequate shopping list of supplies. To ensure a steady market and increase predictability of demand, however, the programme should be closely connected with the Totu Extension Pilot Project which is currently experimenting with extending farm input loans to trainee farmers. These loans could be extended as vouchers redeemable in farm supplies from stockists and repayments made into a revolving fund which, in time, might well evolve into a farmer’s credit union...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises two {{essays on}} earnings forecasting accuracy. Chapter 2 focuses on how management forecasting accuracy {{is affected by}} managers' behavioral biases over time and Chapter 3 addresses how analyst portfolio design choices affect cross-sectional differences in analyst forecasting accuracy. In particular, Chapter 2 examines how CEOs' overconfidence and their exhibited self-serving attribution biases affect how they adjust their future earnings forecasts when they receive feedback concerning their prior forecasts. I find that overconfident CEOs respond to feedback by improving their future forecasting accuracy, but they do so more slowly than their less confident peers. I also find that overconfident CEOs learn to improve their future forecasting accuracy only when feedback is less ambiguous {{in the form of}} forecasting errors. In contrast, managers who are less confident respond to both less ambiguous forecasting errors and more ambiguous market feedback concerning their prior forecasts. Chapter 3 examines analysts' supply chain coverage portfolio design and their forecasting accuracy. I define the relation between a firm and one of the firm's major customer firms as a "supply chain relation". Further, I define an analyst who issues forecasts for both the firm and {{one or more of the}} firm's major customers in the same year as a "supply chain analyst". I classify all firms followed by the supply chain analyst into one of the three categories in a given year: "focal firms", i. e., firms for which the analyst also covers one or more of the firm's major customers, "major customers" of a focal firm for the analyst, and "other" firms which include all remaining firms in the analyst's portfolio. I find that analysts who follow both a focal firm and one or more of the firm's major customers issue significantly more accurate earnings forecasts for both the focal firm and the firm's major customers than the same analysts issue for "other" firms in the analyst portfolio. I also find that these analysts are more accurate in their forecasts for the focal firm and the firm's major customers than other <b>non-supply</b> chain analysts following the same firm, but not the firm's supply chain. I show that the superior forecasting accuracy for supply chain analysts for both the focal firm and the firm's major customers is achieved at the cost of reduced forecasting accuracy for "other" firms in the analyst portfolio. In explaining the relative importance of forecasting accuracy for the firms in the analyst portfolio, I find that focal firms and the firms' major customers are more likely to generate more profitable trading commissions and operate in an industry segment that has a greater number of other peer firms than "other" firms in the same analyst portfolio. This evidence is consistent with earlier studies and suggests when analysts have stronger incentives to generate trading commissions from the stock of a firm, the analysts are more likely to spend effort to acquire more precise information about the firm (Hayes, 1998). When covering the firm's supply chains helps analysts produce more precise information about the firm, analyst forecasting accuracy improves accordingly...|$|R
