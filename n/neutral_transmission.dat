The mechanism {{eliminates the need for}} a starting device and auxiliary clutches and gears for reverse. A very good launch feel without the use of a torque converter should be one of the main benefits. When combined with two clutches, resulting in a two-stage split-torque geared <b>neutral</b> <b>transmission,</b> the system can be augmented such that very high overdrive ratio's can be obtained, allowing low engine speeds at intermediate engine power levels to reduce fuel consumption. The mode shift can be carried out with a synchronised clutch. One of the main points of concern is the loading of the V-belt-type variator in and around the geared neutral point. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to address this issue in some de! tail, taking both slip and torque loss into account.

40|$|Combining both {{launch and}} reverse drive {{functions}} with the ratio change {{function in a}} geared neutral continuously variable transmission (GN-CVT), thus making a launch device like a torque converter and a drive-neutral-reverse set obsolete, is attracting considerable attention. This paper covers modelling and simulation of a V-belt type geared <b>neutral</b> <b>transmission</b> {{in and around the}} geared neutral point. Due to the specific nature of the geared neutral state, conventional driveline simulation models are shown to be inadequate. Experimental results are presented allowing for a more detailed description of the functional properties of the V-belt type variator, especially those related to small amounts of slip between the belt and the pulleys. The measured data will be analyzed to obtain grey model fitting parameters, which allow the data to be used in a simulation program, based on a dynamic driveline model. It will be shown that with a GN-CVT stall and launch performance can be considerably better than that to be achieved with a driveline with torque converter...|$|E
50|$|Columbia University Law School {{professor}} Tim Wu {{observed the}} Internet is not neutral {{in terms of}} its impact on applications having different requirements. It is more beneficial for data applications than for applications that require low latency and low jitter, such as voice and real-time video. He explains that looking at the full spectrum of applications, including both those that are sensitive to network latency and those that are not, the IP suite isn't actually neutral. He has proposed regulations on Internet access networks that define net neutrality as equal treatment among similar applications, rather than <b>neutral</b> <b>transmissions</b> regardless of applications. He proposes allowing broadband operators to make reasonable trade-offs between the requirements of different applications, while regulators carefully scrutinize network operator behavior where local networks interconnect. However, it is important to ensure that these trade-offs among different applications be done transparently so that the public will have input on important policy decisions. This is especially important as the broadband operators often provide competing services—e.g., cable TV, telephony—that might differentially benefit when the need to manage applications could be invoked to disadvantage other competitors.|$|R

One kind of STF is a sculptured thin film, generally deposited with a glancing angle deposition technique. Several optical components were designed and fabricated using this technique. This includes a TiO 2 based wave-plate for an operating wavelength of 550 nm, a multilayer based beam splitter with a transmittance of 75. 0 % for TM light and 38. 6 % for TE light at 632 nm, and a multilayer based polarization <b>neutral</b> <b>transmission</b> filter for an incidence angle of 45 °.

Here, we report the use of morphological control of perovskite thin films to form semitransparent planar heterojunction solar cells with neutral color and comparatively high efficiencies. We take advantage of spontaneous dewetting to create microstructured arrays of perovskite "islands", on a length-scale small enough to appear continuous to the eye yet large enough to enable unattenuated transmission of light between the islands. The islands are thick enough to absorb most visible light, and the combination of completely absorbing and completely transparent regions results in <b>neutral</b> <b>transmission</b> of light. Using these films, we fabricate thin-film solar cells with respectable power conversion efficiencies. Remarkably, we find that such discontinuous films still have good rectification behavior and relatively high open-circuit voltages due to the inherent rectification between the n- and p-type charge collection layers. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ease of "color-tinting" such microstructured perovksite solar cells with no reduction in performance, by incorporation of a dye within the hole transport medium. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|E

The healthy cloned cattle were derived from nuclear transfer of an identical nuclear genetic background (mural granulosa donor cells including surrounding cytoplasm) into enucleated oocytes with either Bos indicus or B. taurus mtDNA. Here we report the first cases of coexisting mtDNAs of two closely related subspecies following nuclear transfer. Heteroplasmy (0. 6 - 2. 8 %) was found in 4 out of 11 cross-subspecies cloned cattle. Quantitation was performed using "amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) allele-specific real-time PCR.

40|$|We {{report the}} use of a new pH-sensitive dual-emission fluoroprobe, carboxy-seminaphthorhodafluor- 1 (carboxy-SNARF- 1) for {{ratiometric}} recording of intracellular pH (pHi) in small isolated cells. The method is illustrated with pHi measurement in single type- 1 cells (cell diameter approximately 10 microns) isolated from the carotid body of the neonatal rat. Carboxy-SNARF- 1 is loaded using bath application of the acetoxymethyl ester. When excited at 540 nm, the fluoroprobe gives strong, inversely related emission signals at 590 nm and 640 nm. Stable ratiometric recordings of pHi can be achieved from a single cell (pHi 8. 5 - 6. 5) for up to 50 min.

40|$|Characterization of {{phytoplankton}} community {{composition is}} critical to understanding the ecology and biogeochemistry of the oceans. One approach to taxonomic characterization takes advantage of differing pigmentation between algal taxa and thus differences in fluorescence excitation spectra. Analyses of bulk water samples, however, may be confounded by interference from chromophoric dissolved organic matter or suspended particulate matter. Here, we describe an instrument that uses a laser trap based on a Nikon TE 2000 -U microscope to position individual phytoplankton cells for confocal fluorescence excitation spectroscopy, thus avoiding interference from the surrounding medium. Quantitative measurements of optical power give data {{in the form of}} photons emitted per photon of exposure for an individual phytoplankton cell. Residence times for individual phytoplankton in the instrument can be as long as several minutes with no substantial change in their fluorescence excitation spectra. The laser trap was found to generate two-photon fluorescence from the organisms so a modification was made to release the trap momentarily during data acquisition.

We investigated the effect of PAMP and adrenomedullin on peripheral sympathetic <b>neutral</b> <b>transmission.</b> Using perfused rat mesenteric arteries, PAMP (0, 1, 5, and 10 pmol/ml) decreased norepinephrine overflow by periarterial electrical nerve stimulation in a dose-dependent fashion (0. 244 +/- 0. 043, 0. 231 +/- 0. 048, 0. 195 +/- 0. 061 and 0. 168 +/- 0. 051 ng/gram tissue weigh: NS, P < 0. 05, and P < 0. 02, respectively). In contrast to PAMP, adrenomedullin (1, 5, and 10 pmol/ml) did not change it. In contrast, vasoconstrictive response of mesenteric arteries to exogenous norepinephrine was significantly attenuated by 10 pmol/ml of adrenomedullin but not by the same dose of PAMP. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (8 - 37) [CGRP(8 - 37) ], a CGRP receptor antagonist, inhibited the vasodilatory effect of adrenomedullin but could not suppress the sympathoinhibitory effect of PAMP. Neither a nicotinic antagonist, hexamethonium, nor a presynaptic alfa 2 antagonist, yohimbine, blocked the sympathoinhibitory effect of PAMP. Thus, it suggests that PAMP and adrenomedullin, which {{are derived from}} the same gene, exhibit different hypotensive mechanisms: PAMP inhibits neural transmission at peripheral sympathetic nerve ending, although adrenomedullin directly dilates vascular smooth muscle, possibly through CGRP-like receptor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) of the cloned sheep "Dolly" {{and nine}} other ovine clones produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) {{was reported to}} consist only of recipient oocyte mtDNA without any detectable mtDNA contribution from the nucleus donor cell. In cattle, mouse and pig several {{or most of the}} clones showed transmission of nuclear donor mtDNA resulting in mitochondrial heteroplasmy. To clarify the discrepant transmission pattern of donor mtDNA in sheep clones we analysed the mtDNA composition of seven fetuses and five lambs cloned from fetal fibroblasts. Results The three fetal fibroblast donor cells used for SCNT harboured low mtDNA copy numbers per cell (A: 753 ± 54, B: 292 ± 33 and C: 561 ± 88). The ratio of donor to recipient oocyte mtDNAs was determined using a quantitative amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR (i. e. ARMS-qPCR). For quantification of SNP variants with frequencies below 0. 1 % we developed a restriction endonuclease-mediated selective quantitative PCR (REMS-qPCR). We report the first cases (n = 4 fetuses, n = 3 lambs) of recipient oocyte/nuclear donor mtDNA heteroplasmy in SCNT-derived ovine clones demonstrating that there is no species-effect hindering ovine nucleus-donor mtDNA from being transmitted to the somatic clonal offspring. Most of the heteroplasmic clones exhibited low-level heteroplasmy (0. 1 % to 0. 9 %, n = 6) indicating <b>neutral</b> <b>transmission</b> of parental mtDNAs. High-level heteroplasmy (6. 8 % to 46. 5 %) was observed in one case. This clone possessed a divergent recipient oocyte-derived mtDNA genotype with three rare amino acid changes compared to the donor including one substitution at an evolutionary conserved site. Conclusion Our study using state-of-the-art techniques for mtDNA quantification, like ARMS-qPCR and the novel REMS-qPCR, documents {{for the first time the}} transmission of donor mtDNA into somatic sheep clones. MtDNA heteroplasmy was detected in seven of 12 clones tested, whereby all but one case revealed less than 1 % mtDNA contribution from the nuclear donor cell suggesting neutral segregation. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the visual effect of coloured filters compared to transmission-matched neutral density filters, in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration. Methods: Visual acuity (VA, logMAR), contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson) and colour vision (D 15) were recorded for 39 patients (average age 79. 1 ± 7. 2 years) with age-related macular degeneration, both in the presence and absence of glare from a fluorescent source. Patients then chose their preferred coloured and matched <b>neutral</b> density <b>transmission</b> filters (NoIR). Visual function tests were repeated with the chosen filters, both in the presence and absence of glare from the fluorescent source. Patients trialled the two filters for two weeks each, in random order. Following the trial of each filter, a telephone questionnaire was completed. Results: VA and contrast sensitivity were unaffected by the coloured filters but reduced through the neutral density filters (p < 0. 01). VA and contrast sensitivity were reduced by similar amounts, following the introduction of the glare source, both in the presence and absence of filters (p < 0. 001). Colour vision error scores were increased following the introduction of a neutral density filter (from 177. 6 ± 60. 2 to 251. 9 ± 115. 2) and still further through coloured filters (275. 1 ± 50. 8; p < 0. 001). In the absence of any filter, colour vision error scores increased by 29. 1 ± 55. 60 units in the presence of glare (F 2, 107 = 3. 9, p = 0. 02); however, there was little change in colour vision error scores, in the presence of glare, with either the neutral density or coloured filters. Questionnaires indicated that patients tended to gain more benefit from the coloured filters. Conclusions: Coloured filters had minimal impact on VA and contrast sensitivity in patients with age-related macular degeneration; however, they caused a small reduction in objective colour vision, although this was not registered subjectively by patients. Patients indicated that they received more benefit from the coloured filters compared with neutral density filters. © 2013 The Authors © 2013 Optometrists Association Australia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{increasing}} evidence that alcoholism runs in families suggesting that genetic factors {{may play a}} role. In support of this hypothesis, the alcohol-preferring (AA) and the alcohol-avoiding (ANA) rat lines have been developed through selective outbreeding. Numerous studies indicate that the endogenous opioid system {{may be involved in}} controlling ethanol consumption. Changes in opioid peptides and opioid receptors have been described after ethanol intake. But, the influence of ethanol on peptidolytic degradation of opioid peptides has been largely ignored, although the peptidase-mediated metabolism of neuropeptides is known as an important regulatory site of peptidergic <b>transmission.</b> <b>Neutral</b> endopeptidase 24. 11 (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) degrade neuropeptides, including enkephalin and are expressed in the brain. Furthermore, a good correspondence between the regional distribution of NEP and opioid receptors in rat brain has already been reported pointing to a possible role of NEP in regulating opioid peptides. For both enzymes studied, the gene expression pattern was found to be in good agreement with the corresponding enzyme activities in the brain regions investigated, showing the highest levels for both specific mRNAs and enzyme activities in the striatum. Differences in both measured parameters were detected in distinct brain regions of AA and ANA rats. Furthermore, in some brain regions discrepancies between ACE and NEP mRNA levels and the corresponding enzyme activities were observed. For example, in olfactory bulb and striatum such discrepancies were found for both enzymes studied. In tegmentum/colliculi a higher NEP gene expression in AA rats was associated with a higher NEP enzyme activity compared to the amounts found in ANA rats...|$|R
40|$|Language, culture, {{identity}} and citizenship {{are closely related}} terms, in which concepts of ‘language’ and ‘citizenship’ have always been linked to notions of nationality in political thought and consequently, they have been embedded in the national linguistic and educational policies. Language policy therefore as a national ‘decision-making about language’ would count by some researchers as linguistic culture (Schiffman, 1998) or others as ‘language ideology’ (Schieffelin, Woolard and Kroskrity, 1998). The chapter is to discuss, with reference to China’s case, how language and citizenship are interconnected through the national language policy, how each language policy as a particular notion of linguistic culture {{play an important role}} in construction of national identity which forms the main part of citizenship education. With particular reference to the English education over the last three decades, the chapter presents a study on China’s changing attitudes towards citizenship education from moral oriented civic education to skill centred global citizen education. The study reveals various factors behind this national drive of foreign language learning, identifying as well those issues, emerging from the process, which relate to key concepts such as democracy, justice, rights and responsibilities, identities and diversity that young generations need to understand and also key processes and skills that students need to develop, such as critical thinking and enquiry, advocacy and representation, taking informed and responsible actions. The writing argues that English education seen as a natural, <b>neutral</b> and beneficial <b>transmission</b> has become a catalyst of practical values to facilitate the processes of constructing Chinese citizenship education in a globalizing world. Bilingualism as a linguistic function as well as a cross cultural perspective will enhance intercultural communication between the upheld national {{identity and}} international cosmopolitanism, and bridge over the indigenous cultural traditions and the western democratic values. However, it is also arguable that such special weight given to the teaching of English as an only compulsory foreign language taught in China’s most schools and universities is not without its danger because it runs against the basic principle of a cross cultural perspective and practice. Global citizenship demands cultural awareness of commonalities in the interdependent global community as well as cross-national values in terms of linguistic and cultural differences...|$|R
40|$|Crossflow {{microfiltration}} (0. 1 μm) of {{skimmed milk}} {{is widely used}} in the dairy industry for the separation of casein micelles from soluble proteins. Microfiltration performance, {{both in terms of}} permeability and selectivity, are altered by the accumulation of casein micelles at the membrane surface, that turns into an irreversible deposit in Critical Hydrodynamic Conditions (CHC defined by (J/ w) crit with J : permeation flux, : shear stress at the membrane surface) [1]. Despite the main role of the casein micelle deposit on soluble protein transmission, little attention was paid to the impact of micelle deposit on membrane selectivity. Some studies have focused on the impact of physico-chemical characteristics of soluble proteins on their transmission during microfiltration of milk or dairy proteins suspensions. Others have focused on the impact of hydrodynamic conditions but none of them consider both simultaneously. Le Berre and Daufin (1998) [2] for instance, studied the soluble protein transfer considering the physico-chemical characteristics of individual proteins but this study was carried out under constant hydrodynamic conditions. Hence, this paper aims at understanding the transfer of soluble protein by taking into account both the hydrodynamic conditions of filtration and the physico-chemical characteristics of individual proteins. In that purpose, the transmission of the five major soluble proteins of milk was studied {{as a function of the}} hydrodynamic conditions of filtration in presence and in absence of the casein micelles. At pH= 6. 55 α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin and serum albumin bovine are negative charged, the immunoglobulins (IgG) are globally neutral and lactoferrin, LF is a positive protein. The present work was conducted on thermised skimmed milk (68 ± 1 °C, 25 s). MF was operated with a set-up equipped with the uniform transmembrane pressure system and with a 0. 1 μm tubular ceramic membrane. An original methodology of filtration based on step by step variation (decrease and successive increase) at constant permeation flux was used to determine deposit characteristics. This study clearly shows that the casein micelle deposit irreversibly alters soluble protein transmission and that the transmission of soluble proteins can be divided into three main groups. For negatively charged proteins, and in the absence of casein micelles deposit, the transmissions of proteins are mainly ruled by steric exclusion through the membrane and accumulated layers. In the presence of casein micelles deposit, the accumulation of micelles at the membrane surface results in a high density of negative charges at the membrane surface. Electrostatic repulsions between accumulated casein micelles and soluble proteins leads then to a significant decrease in transmission of negatively charged proteins. For lactoferrin (positively charged protein), the protein is entrapped in casein micelles deposit. This phenomenon is partially attributed to electrostatic interactions with casein micelles: an increase in ionic strength actually results in charge screening and in a sharp increase of its <b>transmission.</b> For <b>neutral</b> proteins, the <b>transmission</b> is mainly attributed to steric exclusion. Inthe presence of casein micelles deposit, the <b>transmission</b> of <b>neutral</b> proteins is increased due to increase in polarization concentration. For the first time this study shows that the transmission of proteins during microfiltration (in our case microfiltration 0. 1 μm of milk) can be partially explain by electrostatic effects between proteins to be transmitted and accumulated colloids at the membrane surface...|$|R
