But that's not necessarily how it's perceived by everybody else, which I do understand." [...] "I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person [...] it’s <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would like to do solely."

500|$|In a 60 Minutes {{interview}} on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated {{that she had}} no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, {{with the exception of the}} anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a [...] "betrayal" [...] of American forces and of the [...] "country that gave me privilege". Fonda said, [...] "The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine." [...] She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as propaganda and pride for her anti-war activism: [...] "There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will apologize for." [...] Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: [...] "Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E

5000|$|Glitter, Shards, Doom, Memory pays {{tribute to}} the Jewish artist Felix Nussbaum and other victims of the Holocaust. Ran wrote in the score program note, [...] "As in several other works {{composed}} since 1969, this is my way of saying 'do <b>not</b> forget,' <b>something</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> believe, can be done through music with special power and poignancy." [...] The title of the piece comes from an art exhibit of works from the Weimar Republic titled Glitter and Doom, which was formerly shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|R
5000|$|The {{magazine}} halted publication {{during the}} 2001 economic downturn, after a financial backer withdrew support. New Yorker editor David Remnick told The New York Times, [...] "That is terrible. I really enjoyed it — I always found something fascinating {{to read in}} that magazine, and <b>not</b> infrequently <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish we had had for The New Yorker." [...] The company behind the magazine declared bankruptcy in April 2002. Later in 2002, editor Alexander Star assembled an anthology: Quick Studies: The Best of Lingua Franca, published by Farrar Straus Giroux.|$|R

The whole thing fills me with extreme concern. I might insist on having a cat on the programme, because I think the BBC as a public service broadcaster have got to give equal time in my view to cats.|$|E

You know how much more his words mean than those from some mamma-jamma wearing glasses and an {{alligator}} shirt behind a typewriter? ... I've heard some people say I'm not talking about anything on this record. And what {{a lot of other people}} get wrong about the record is that I'm not trying to be this great visionary wizard. Paisley Park is in everybody's heart. It's <b>not</b> just <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have the keys to. I was trying to say something about looking inside oneself to find perfection. Perfection is in everyone. Nobody's perfect, but they can be. We may never reach that, but it's better to strive than not." ...|$|R

500|$|Hill did {{not regard}} sport {{climbing}} {{to be real}} climbing and felt out of place on the professional indoor climbing World Cup circuit, so she left in 1992 {{and went back to}} traditional rock climbing. As she explained in an interview, [...] "the thing I didn't like too much towards the end was how focused it was on just indoor climbing and training. I didn't start out training on artificial walls, and <b>that's</b> <b>not</b> really ever <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do as a full-time profession". In her autobiography, she also comments on the [...] "bad sportsmanship, rule bending, and monumental egos that infested the competitions". She looked for different challenges and set herself the task of free climbing (that is, using climbing aids only to protect her from falls) The Nose, a famous route on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley.|$|R

At the age of 17, Hughes learned to play the drums, and when Scott and Rice-Oxley formed a small covers band in 1995 {{he was invited to}} join as drummer. They later invited future lead singer Tom Chaplin to join the band, although Hughes initially objected, later stating, [...] "The idea of giving someone who's already the loudest person you know a microphone was <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was particularly keen on." ...|$|E

In an interview with Rock & Rose, singer Steven Battelle expressed surprise at this level of mainstream exposure: [...] "Being play-listed on Radio 1, that’s huge. You get spot plays on the evening shows but now we’re proper daytime radio and that’s <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought would happen with our band, not straight away anyway." ...|$|E
60|$|This is {{the excuse}} {{for all that}} {{indeterminate}} and rambling and sometimes sentimental criticism of which Dickens, more than any one else, is the victim, of which <b>I</b> fear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> for one have made him the victim in this place. When I was a boy I could not understand why the Dickensians worried so wearily about Dickens, about where he went to school and where he ate his dinners, about how he wore his trousers and when he cut his hair. I used to wonder why they did <b>not</b> write <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could read about a man like Micawber. But I {{have come to the}} conclusion that this almost hysterical worship of the man, combined with a comparatively feeble criticism on his works, is just and natural. Dickens was a man like ourselves; we can see where he went wrong, and study him without being stunned or getting the sunstroke. But Micawber is not a man; Micawber is the superman. We can only walk round and round him wondering what we shall say. All the critics of Dickens, when all is said and done, have only walked round and round Micawber wondering what they should say. I am myself at this moment walking round and round Micawber wondering what I shall say. And I have not found out yet.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} body {{of scholarship}} on Kant’s Critique of Judgment {{is rife with}} disagreement. At the centre of much of this disagreement {{is the issue of}} precisely what Kant understands to be taking place in a harmonization of the cognitive faculties. Is aesthetic reflective judgment to be identified with, or separated from, this harmonious state of the faculties of imagination and understanding? If aesthetic judgment is identified with this state, as is argued herein, then upon what is a judgment of beauty to be based? These questions are addressed by focussing on two closely related aspects of Kant’s theory of reflective judgment; the role Kant assigns to the power of desire (i. e., to the will) and to the causal structure implicated in reflective judgment. In brief, we argue that a judgment of beauty is <b>not,</b> strictly speaking, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do, but is better described <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> happens of itsel...|$|R

5000|$|Matt Snyders, a {{journalist}} for the Minneapolis newspaper City Pages, tried Salvia divinorum {{for himself as}} part of his journalistic investigations. On April 9, 2008 he told of calling Representative Atkins and inviting him to do the same in order to research the issue more thoroughly. Snyders argued that Atkins would [...] "be able to brandish his position with more credibility were he to experience the [...] "drug" [...] firsthand." [...] Representative Atkins reply was [...] "Frankly, it's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have a considerable amount of time to do. Even if I wanted to."

5000|$|... "is an area where, {{if you ask}} {{me where}} has been the one area where I feel that I've been most {{frustrated}} and most stymied, it {{is the fact that the}} United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense, gun-safety laws. Even in the face of repeated mass killings. And you know, if you look at the number of Americans killed since 9/11 by terrorism, it's less than 100. If you look at the number that have been killed by gun violence, it's in the tens of thousands. And for us not to be able to resolve that issue has been something that is distressing. But it is <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> intend to stop working on in the remaining 18 months".|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{think the}} fact I trained as a composer, and was educated to write all my ideas {{independently}} has made {{a huge difference in}} terms of how well I can shape my songs. People always say music is <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can be taught, and they are right, it comes naturally to some, but I think having a musical education has allowed me {{to have a lot more}} control and be more involved with the collaborations I do rather than just putting my vocals to <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn’t create which I would actually never allow.

It's <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> find exciting, as it's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> I've really worked with a lot in the past. It still holds some mystery for me.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Alec Baldwin, in which he complimented Wiig on her ability to switch between sexy and unsexy characters, Wiig replied:I have to say, {{one of the greatest}} gifts that I've gotten from SNL is getting out of my comfort zone. I realized, and I think Lorne Michaels realized, probably the first handful of years that I was there, most of my characters were ladies in their forties with short hair and weird sweaters, that no one wanted at their dinner party. The good thing about being at SNL, for me creatively, is to think, [...] "Okay, I'm comfortable enough.

I'm not going to pretend that decriminalisation will fix everything, but I can tell you that it will fix certain things and it will allow those who do it by choice to do so in a more safe manner. And it will also allow those who do so from an exploited situation to do so in a way that keeps them safe, until they can get to a point where they can either decide to move on to something else, or they can do so in a different setting where they don't feel nearly as exploited as before.|$|E
