500|$|Paramount {{secured the}} {{likeness}} rights of Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto {{in the summer}} of 2011 for an upcoming game based on the universe of the film Star Trek (2009). It was not until a year later in June 2012 that the voice work contracts were signed for the pair, and it was also announced that the likeness rights and voice acting {{of the rest of the}} main cast from the film had been secured. Some cast members such as Pegg improvised parts of their performances. Quinto praised the positive experience in the recording studio, and said that [...] "it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to play the character and not have to do all this physical stuff".|$|E
500|$|During {{the shoot}} {{of the music}} video for [...] "First" [...] (2005), Lohan {{revealed}} {{in an interview with}} MTV that she was preparing her sophomore studio album. [...] "When you get into the studio, everything just comes out," [...] she said. [...] "All your creative juices are there. I don't [...] leave. I'll still be in there until all hours, and it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do that." [...] Lohan began writing lyrics for the album in June 2005, after the last single from her previous album had been released. [...] "I've been writing a lot, almost every night," [...] she said. [...] "There's been a lot going on , and I think people can find that escape in hobbies that they do. I don't do yoga or anything, but some people use that. Everyone has their own thing, and I use writing." [...] Initially titled There's Only One Angel In Heaven, the pop rock album features a darker theme when compared to Lohan's previous album, Speak (2004).|$|E
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to do something like that}} that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the early}} lap {{fight for the}} lead with {{teammate}} Massa, Valtteri Bottas stated that {{he was sure he}} could have pulled a gap to the Mercedes behind. However, he insisted that [...] "No one should let anyone by. That's not racing, but it would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> race when I had the best opportunities." [...] Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner declared after the race that a spin on a damp track had allegedly cost Daniil Kvyat the chance to challenge for a podium position. Following the race, the stewards decided not to take any action regarding the first-lap incident between the Lotus and McLaren drivers.|$|R

Dan comments {{that he and his}} mom <b>were</b> never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> play with the kids before, and how <b>nice</b> it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do that now.|$|R
5000|$|Pokémon Stadium {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. GameSpot contributor Jeff Gerstmann gave the game a 5.7 [...] "mediocre" [...] review, writing that the gameplay [...] "feels scaled down and oversimplified, even {{when compared with}} the original Game Boy games". IGN's Peer Schneider wrote an 8.2 [...] "great" [...] review of the game, calling it [...] "a must-buy for Pokémon fans", but also citing that [...] "the audio is nowhere near the quality of some of the recent Nintendo releases". Regarding the game's announcer, a frequent complaint among critics, RPGamer's Ben Martin wrote that: [...] "With a very limited vocabulary and continual comments thoughout sic every single action, it certainly <b>is</b> a <b>nice</b> option <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> turn this guy off". In his review on gaming website Cubed3, Ross Morley praised the game's battle system for its [...] "beautiful 3D models, special effects and range of options".|$|R
500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing there looking at me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E

6000|$|The tone of {{this was}} so still more serious that she had but her one acknowledgement. [...] "I'd do {{anything}} for you--I'd do anything for you," [...] she repeated. She had already, she felt, said it all; so what did anything more, anything less, matter? That was the very reason indeed why she could, with a lighter note, ease him generously of any awkwardness produced by solemnity, either his own or hers. [...] "Of course it must <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> for you <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> think there <b>are</b> people all about who feel in such a way." ...|$|R

50|$|The indoor parks {{were built}} for several {{different}} reasons, chief among those weather. However, as multi-purpose parks became unfashionable, {{so did the}} drab indoor parks. This {{led to the creation}} of retractable-roof parks. These allowed shelter from the elements, but still could be opened on a <b>nice</b> day. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> support the roof, most were closed in on all sides like multi-purpose and indoor parks, but as all retractable-roof parks except Rogers Centre are baseball only, every square foot does not need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> filled with seating, and there is plenty of room for open spaces or windows that look outside. Because the roof needs to go somewhere when not covering the field, a distinguishing characteristic of the retractable roof park is a large extension of the interior spaces to either one side of the field or both sides that the roof sits on when retracted. The only exception <b>to</b> this <b>is</b> Miller Park whose fan-shaped roof folds in upon itself and hangs behind the stands down the foul lines. Often, when retracted, the roof still hangs over the field, casting large shadows. This is countered at Miller Park by large panes of glass under the roof. While most seal up when the roof is closed, others are at least partially open, with large gaps that do not let in harsh weather, but don't give the feel of being inside. Except for Rogers Centre, all of these parks feature natural grass.|$|R
500|$|The {{classical}} Kuiper belt appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a composite}} of two separate populations. The first, known as the [...] "dynamically cold" [...] population, has orbits much like the planets; nearly circular, with an orbital eccentricity of less than 0.1, and with relatively low inclinations up to about 10° (they lie close to {{the plane of the}} Solar System rather than at an angle). The cold population also contain a concentration of objects, referred to as the kernel, with semi-major axes at 44–44.5 AU. The second, the [...] "dynamically hot" [...] population, has orbits much more inclined to the ecliptic, by up to 30°. The two populations have been named this way not because of any major difference in temperature, but from analogy to particles in a gas, which increase their relative velocity as they become heated up. Not only are the two populations in different orbits, the cold population also differs in color and albedo, being redder and brighter, has a larger fraction of binary objects, has a different size distribution, and lacks very large objects. The difference in colors may be a reflection of different compositions, which suggests they formed in different regions. The hot population <b>is</b> proposed <b>to</b> have formed near Neptune's original orbit and <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> scattered out during the migration of the giant planets. The cold population, on the other hand, has <b>been</b> proposed <b>to</b> have formed more or less in its current position because the loose binaries would <b>be</b> unlikely <b>to</b> survive encounters with Neptune. Although the <b>Nice</b> model appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> at least partially explain a compositional difference, it has also been suggested the color difference may reflect differences in surface evolution.|$|R
