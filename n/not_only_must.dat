25|$|Some {{drugs are}} {{approved}} by the FDA under subsection H, which has two subparts.

The second part of subsection H applies to drugs that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>must</b> meet restrictions for use due to safety requirements, but also are required to meet postmarketing surveillance to establish that the safety results shown in clinical trials are seconded by use in a much wider population. Mifepristone was approved under the second part of subsection H. The result is that women cannot pick the drug up at a pharmacy, but must now receive it directly from a doctor. Due to the possibility of adverse reactions such as excessive bleeding, which may require a blood transfusion, and incomplete abortion, which may require surgical intervention, the drug is only considered safe if a physician who is capable of administering a blood transfusion or a surgical abortion is available to the patient in the event of such emergencies. The approval of mifepristone under subsection H included a black box warning.|$|E

500|$|At {{the moment}} of touchdown, the spoiler lever was in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position. According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls, {{in order for the}} {{spoilers}} to automatically deploy upon touchdown <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>must</b> the spoiler lever be in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the [...] "idle" [...] position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when {{one or more of the}} thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged. Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the [...] "idle" [...] setting required for automatic spoiler deployment. Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the [...] "climb" [...] detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.|$|E
