5|$|Republican Rep. Joe Stengel was term-limited in 2006 {{and could}} <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> {{re-election}} to the Colorado House of Representatives from House District 38; both Rice and Republican Matt Dunn sought election to Stengel's house seat. The race {{was a top}} target for the Colorado GOP, who unsuccessfully {{tried to keep the}} seat in Republican hands during a year where Republicans lost ground both nationally and in Colorado.|$|E

During his short tenure, Dixon's major accomplishment was convincing Stephen Douglas to include language in the Kansas-Nebraska Act that explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise's prohibition on slavery north of latitude 36°30'.|$|E
5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{lieutenant}} governor does not preside over the state Senate, {{as is the case}} in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and was a member of the governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee. As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917. When McCall decided that he would <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.|$|E

The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim. He did <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> re-election in 1870, instead making a failed run for the office of governor.

5|$|On 7January 1830 Etty's mentor Thomas Lawrence died, {{followed}} on 30July by Etty's mother.

One of these, Judith Going Forth, was an addition to Judith, which had been commissioned the previous year by that painting's new owners, the Royal Scottish Academy.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} {{democracy}} and government reforms beginning in 1986 were hampered by national debt, government corruption, coup attempts, disasters, a persistent communist insurgency, and a military conflict with Moro separatists. During Corazon Aquino's administration, U.S. forces withdrew from the Philippines, due to {{the rejection of the}} U.S. Bases Extension Treaty, and leading to the official transfer of Clark Air Base in November 1991 and Subic Bay to the government in December 1992. The administration also faced a series of natural disasters, including the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991. After introducing a constitution that limited presidents to a single term, Aquino did <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> re-election.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1971, Thorpe's {{political}} career had stalled. He had led the party to a disastrous performance in the United Kingdom general election of June 1970; in an unexpected victory for the Conservatives under Edward Heath, the Liberals lost seven of their thirteen parliamentary seats, and Thorpe's majority in North Devon fell to below 400. Bessell, with mounting business worries, did <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> re-election in Bodmin. Thorpe faced censure for his conduct of a campaign during which he had spent extravagantly and left the party {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy; but the matter was put aside in a wave of sympathy when his wife Caroline was killed in a road accident 10 days after the election. Thorpe was devastated; he continued as leader, but for the next year performed little beyond routine party duties.|$|E

5|$|He {{was elected}} unopposed in 1796, but did <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> the borough in 1802. Though {{a friend of}} Pitt's government, he rarely {{attended}} the House; George Rose commented in a letter that Villiers's loss would have {{no impact on the}} Tories. While a member of parliament, in 1798, he married Lord Boringdon's daughter, Theresa, who would bear him ten children over the next two decades. After leaving Parliament, Villiers continued his presence at Court, and carried messages from the Princess Royal in Stuttgart to the king. In 1803, the duties of his office as paymaster were extended, and on 9 May, he was reappointed as Paymaster and Inspector-General of Marines, with a salary of £1,000 p.a. In the same year, he was commissioned a captain in the Watford Volunteer Cavalry. Villiers was prepared to intercede with the king on behalf of Pitt to fulfill the latter's desire for a more comprehensive ministry, which, however, was frustrated; and to bring Pitt's friends into the Ministry of All the Talents in 1806.|$|E
