5|$|The pain pathway {{is mostly}} {{transmitted}} via myelinated Aδ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation {{to the teeth}} and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of pain is processed in the medullary spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} {{with the nature of}} some of the factors that affect the human response to painful stimulation. Specifically, two types of pain thresholds were studied: the first was the minimal <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> intensity which the subject (S) reports as painful, and the second, the minimal <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> intensity at which S requests that stimulation cease.

25|$|Neurons {{functionally}} specialized for nociception {{have been}} documented in other invertebrates including the leech Hirudo medicinalis, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the molluscs Aplysia californica and Cepaea nemoralis. Changes in neuronal activity induced by <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> have been recorded in the nervous centres of Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and larval Manduca sexta.|$|E
25|$|TRP {{channels}} that detect <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> (mechanical, thermal, and chemical pain) relay that info to nociceptors that generate an action potential. Mechanical TRP channels react to depression of their cells (like touch), thermal TRP change shape in different temperatures, and chemical TRP act like taste buds, signalling if their receptors bond to certain elements/chemicals.|$|E
25|$|Argument {{by analogy}} is {{sometimes}} {{used to assess}} the capacity of other animals to experience pain. This is based on the principle that if a non-human animal's responses to <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> {{are similar to those of}} humans, they are likely to have had an analogous experience. For example, if a pin is stuck in a chimpanzee's finger and she rapidly withdraws her hand, then argument by analogy indicates that like humans, she felt pain.|$|E

25|$|The nerves {{of young}} babies respond more readily to <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli,</b> {{with a lower}} {{threshold}} to stimulation, than those of adults. A baby's threshold for sensitization is also substantially decreased, whilst the process involves a much larger area of sensitization with each trauma. The neural pathways that descend from the brain to the spinal cord are not well developed in the newborn, resulting {{in the ability of}} the central nervous system to inhibit nociception being more limited than in the adult.|$|E
25|$|Hyperexcitability hypothesizes that {{referred}} pain has no central mechanism. However, it does {{say that there}} is one central characteristic that predominates. Experiments involving <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> and recordings from the dorsal horn of animals revealed that {{referred pain}} sensations began minutes after muscle stimulation. Pain was felt in a receptive field that was some distance away from the original receptive field. According to hyperexcitability, new receptive fields are created {{as a result of the}} opening of latent convergent afferent fibers in the dorsal horn. This signal could then be perceived as referred pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{peripheral}} terminal of {{the mature}} nociceptor {{is where the}} <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> are detected and transduced into electrical energy. When the electrical energy reaches a threshold value, an action potential is induced and driven towards {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). This leads to the train of events that allows for the conscious awareness of pain. The sensory specificity of nociceptors is established by the high threshold only to particular features of stimuli. Only when the high threshold has been reached by either chemical, thermal, or mechanical environments are the nociceptors triggered. The majority of nociceptors are classified by which of the environmental modalities they respond to. Some nociceptors respond to more than one of these modalities and are consequently designated polymodal. Other nociceptors respond to none of these modalities (although they may respond to stimulation under conditions of inflammation) and are referred to as sleeping or silent.|$|E

40|$|Cannabinoids produce antinociception in many {{preclinical}} {{models of}} acute and chronic pain. In contrast, cannabinoids produce inconsistent analgesia in humans, showing {{little or no}} efficacy in treating acute pain, with modest efficacy in treating chronic inflammatory pain. This discrepancy may reflect an overreliance on preclinical assays of pain-stimulated behaviors, defined as behaviors that increase in rate or intensity following delivery of a <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus.</b> In these assays, antinociception is indicated by a reduction in pain-stimulated behaviors, and antinociception is produced either by a reduction in sensory sensitivity to the <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> (i. e. true analgesia) or by false positive motor impairment. This dissertation addresses this weakness by complementing cannabinoid effects in conventional assays of pain-stimulated behavior with their effects in novel assays of pain-depressed behavior. Pain-depressed behaviors are defined as behaviors that decrease in rate or intensity following presentation of a <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Motor impairment does not produce false positive antinociception in assays of pain-depressed behavior, because antinociception is indicated by a blockade or reversal of pain-induced behavioral depression. In this dissertation, an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of lactic acid served as an acute <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> to stimulate stretching (pain-stimulated behavior) or depress intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) (pain-depressed behavior), whereas, IP injection(s) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) served as a chronic/acute inflammatory-related <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> to stimulate mechanical allodynia (pain-stimulated behavior) or depress ICSS (pain-depressed behavior). Cannabinoids tested in the assays of acid-stimulated stretching and acid-depressed ICSS included: mixed CB 1 R/CB 2 R agonists THC and CP 55940, drugs that modulate levels of the endogenous cannabinoid agonist anandamide (URB 597 and PF 3845), and a selective CB 2 R agonist, GW 405833. THC was also tested in assays of LPS-stimulated mechanical allodynia and LPS-depressed ICSS. In general, mixed CB 1 R/CB 2 R agonists were ineffective or exacerbated pain-depressed behavior regardless of <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Contrastingly, URB 597 and GW 405833 produced antinociception in the assay of acid-depressed ICSS; however their effects were not mediated by CBRs. All compounds produced antinociception in the assay of pain-stimulated behavior, except for PF 3845. These results suggest that assays of pain-depressed behavior may be useful for development of cannabinoid analgesic medications, but that {{further research is needed}} to determine mechanisms underlying cannabinoid-mediated antinociception in these assays...|$|R
50|$|To {{explore the}} {{possibility}} of a trade-off between responding to a <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> and predation, researchers presented rainbow trout with a competing stimulus, a predator cue. Noxiously stimulated fish cease showing anti-predator responses, indicating that pain becomes their primary motivation. The same study investigated the potential trade-off between responding to a <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> and social status. The responses of the noxiously treated trout varied depending on the familiarity of the fish they were placed with. The researchers suggested the findings of the motivational changes and trade-offs provide evidence for central processing of pain rather than merely showing a nociceptive reflex.|$|R
25|$|Individuals {{who suffer}} from chronic pain {{experience}} prolonged pain at sites {{that may have been}} previously injured, yet are otherwise currently healthy. This phenomenon is related to neuroplasticity due to a maladaptive reorganization of the nervous system, both peripherally and centrally. During the period of tissue damage, <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> and inflammation cause an elevation of nociceptive input from the periphery to the central nervous system. Prolonged nociception from the periphery then elicits a neuroplastic response at the cortical level to change its somatotopic organization for the painful site, inducing central sensitization. For instance, individuals experiencing complex regional pain syndrome demonstrate a diminished cortical somatotopic representation of the hand contralaterally as well as a decreased spacing between the hand and the mouth. Additionally, chronic pain has been reported to significantly reduce the volume of grey matter in the brain globally, and more specifically at the prefrontal cortex and right thalamus. However, following treatment, these abnormalities in cortical reorganization and grey matter volume are resolved, as well as their symptoms. Similar results have been reported for phantom limb pain, chronic low back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E
500|$|In {{the long}} term, {{the loss of}} muscle {{function}} can have additional effects from disuse, including atrophy of the muscle. [...] Immobility can lead to pressure sores, [...] particularly in bony areas, requiring precautions such as extra cushioning and turning in bed every two hours (in the acute setting) to relieve pressure. In the long term, people in wheelchairs must shift periodically to relieve pressure. [...] Another complication is pain, including nociceptive pain (indication of potential or actual tissue damage) and neuropathic pain, when [...] nerves affected by damage convey erroneous pain signals {{in the absence of}} <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Spasticity, the uncontrollable tensing of muscles below the level of injury, occurs in 65–78% of chronic SCI. It results from lack of input from the brain that quells muscle responses to stretch reflexes. [...] It can be treated with drugs and physical therapy. Spasticity increases the risk of contractures (shortening of muscles, tendons, or ligaments that result from lack of use of a limb); this problem can be prevented by moving the limb through its full range of motion multiple times a day. [...] Another problem lack of mobility can cause is loss of bone density and changes in bone structure. Loss of bone density (bone demineralization), thought to be due to lack of input from weakened or paralysed muscles, can increase the risk of fractures. Conversely, a poorly understood phenomenon is the overgrowth of bone tissue in soft tissue areas, [...] called heterotopic ossification. [...] It occurs below the level of injury, possibly as a result of inflammation, and happens to a clinically significant extent in 27% of people.|$|E

40|$|It is {{possible}} to distinguish three levels of conflict. One level can be exemplified by a "fight," i. e., a combat motivated only by mutual animosity or mutual fear. In a fight, the opponent is just a <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus.</b> The actions of the combatants are dominated by an urge to destroy or to drive away this <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus.</b> The~aggressive acts {{of each of the}} opponents stimulate aggressive counter acts of the other. This process, then, is mostly self-perpetuating and automatic.

40|$|Medullary raphe magnus (RM) ON and OFF {{cells are}} thought to {{modulate}} spinal nociception by gating withdrawals evoked by noxious stimulation. To test whether withdrawal initiation is the target of RM modulation, we {{examined the relationship between}} ON and OFF cell discharge and motor withdrawal evoked by noxious laser heat in halothane-anesthetized rats. The cellular responses of both cell types began during the 50 msec after onset of the tail flick, peaked within 200 msec, and outlasted the duration of the motor reaction. Thus, {{it is unlikely that the}} target of ON and OFF cell modulation is withdrawal initiation; instead, ON and OFF cells may modulate reactions to repeated noxious stimulation. We therefore tested whether laser heat-evoked changes in RM cell discharge were predictive of the modulatory effects of one <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> on the reaction to a subsequent <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Two pulses of laser heat were presented at interpulse intervals of 0. 8, 2. 0, or 10. 0 sec. The motor withdrawal evoked by the second pulse was significantly enhanced relative to that evoked by the first pulse. The observed motor enhancement depended on supraspinal input because it was not present in spinalized rats. Comparison of the relative changes in motor and cellular activity preceding double laser heat stimulation revealed parallel changes between motor facilitation, decreases in OFF cell discharge, and increases in ON cell discharge. This finding suggests a preparatory role for RM ON and OFF cells in enhancing reactions to a <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> that closely follows another <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Key words: pain; CO 2 laser; motor facilitation; rats; ventromedial medulla; electrophysiolog...|$|R

40|$|Behavioral {{responses}} to painful stimuli require peripheral sensory neurons called nociceptors. Electrophysiological {{studies show that}} most C-fiber nociceptors are polymodal (i. e., respond to multiple <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> modalities, such as mechanical and thermal); nevertheless, these stimuli are perceived as distinct. Therefore, {{it is believed that}} discrimination among these modalities only occurs at spinal or supraspinal levels of processing. Here, we provide evidence to the contrary. Genetic ablation in adulthood of unmyelinated sensory neurons expressing the G protein-coupled receptor Mrgprd reduces behavioral sensitivity to <b>noxious</b> mechanical <b>stimuli</b> but not to heat or cold stimuli. Conversely, pharmacological ablation of the central branches of TRPV 1 + nociceptors, which constitute a nonoverlapping population, selectively abolishes noxious heat pain sensitivity. Combined elimination of both populations yielded an additive phenotype with no additional behavioral deficits, ruling out a redundant contribution of these populations to heat and mechanical pain sensitivity. This double-dissociation suggests that the brain can distinguish different <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> modalities from the earliest stages of sensory processing...|$|R

50|$|As in vertebrates, {{longfin inshore squid}} show {{sensitization}} of avoidance {{responses to}} tactile and visual stimuli associated with a peripheral <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus.</b> This persists for at least 48 hours after injury, indicating that behavioural responses to injury in cephalopods can be {{similar to those in}} vertebrates.|$|R
2500|$|First, {{nociception}} is required.

2500|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{consciousness}} arises in the neocortex, and therefore cannot arise in animals which lack a neocortex.

2500|$|Advocates for Animals, a Scottish {{animal welfare}} group, stated in 2005 that [...] "scientific {{evidence}} ... {{strongly suggests that}} there is a potential for decapod crustaceans and cephalopods to experience pain and suffering".
